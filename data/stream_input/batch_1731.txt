1475143389|5.0|So far I read BLS, Muscle Myths and the Shredded Chef by Mike Matthews. Before I started following the One-Year Challenge program, I had been working out for a year. I saw my body fat decreased and I added on considerable amount of muscles, but I wasn't the size that I wanted to be at. Currently I am at bulking phase. I just finished the first 8 weeks of one year challenge and I already saw massive increase compared to my previous one year workout. This is a great source to have if you are new to weightlifting.
B000E5N684|5.0|A must to view and keep in a library.This thriller was quick moving and a classic to watch.<br />Heard about this in theatres and magazines. Great movie.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I enjoyed thisi book because it held my interest, and I was really engaged with the characters. Also, the history (probably not entirely accurate)  of world war 1, was interesting and gave me the feeling that things have not changed all that much.  I look forward to meeting the characters again in the second book of the trilogy.

B00246VKFM|1.0|I purchased this DVD to show in my English 1 class after reading \\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel.  The film was new in the package.  The volume fluctuates terribly, to the point that it is almost impossible to view.  Also, the film skips in several places, leaving gaps in the plot line.  You might be better to rent the DVD from your local DVD store.  Very disappointed in the quality of this film - and disappointed that my students will not have the opportunity to watch the film.  Don't waste your money.
0525952926|5.0|November 12, 2012<br />A review of the book Winter of the World by Ken Follett<br /><br />This review is written by Anthony T. Riggio after reading \\"Winter of the World\\".  This book is the second of a trilogy about the twentieth century and follows \\"The Fall of Giants\\" which I read over a year ago and gave it a five star rating.  While I did not write a formal review of the fall of Giants, I was so impressed with the beginnings of an epic story, that I believe, stands without rival and that spans such a long period of time covering the lives of families in four countries: Russia, Germany, England and the United States of America. The concept is to analyze and understand the social, economic and political differences of these people and follow how they ultimately interact, which they do, albeit often in different generations of the respective families.<br /><br />Someone once said there is no such thing as a coincidence and I recently read several books dealing with the rise of Nazi Germany and its impact on the three other countries outlined, supra. The books were: Auschwitz: A Doctors Eyewitness Account by Miklos Nyiszli; In the Garden of the Beasts: Love, Terror and An American Family in Hitler's Berlin by Erik Larson and Armageddon: A Novel of Berlin by Leon Uris.  These three books gave me a glimpse of what life was like in Berlin during the 1930's thru the end of World War II.  The current book Winter of the World by Ken Follett gave me additional details that corroborated the facts learned in the previously mentioned books though, it is not necessary to pre read these other books before Winter of the World.  Winter of the world can stand as both historical backdrop and as literature by itself.  I would recommend, however that The Fall of Giants is read first.<br /><br />While I do not know the name of the third work in this trilogy, I will pre-order it from Amazon, as I did for the first two iterations of this remarkable trilogy.  Both are long reads and very capturing to the reader.  Typical of Follett's historical fiction works, they are tomes but the reader never notices.<br /><br />If you are a lover of history and love well written literature you will thoroughly enjoy reading this book, the Winter of the World.  While it is not a necessary mandate that you read them in the order they were published, it will be much more enjoyable to follow the timeline of events and developments of the respective protagonist families.<br /><br />I loved this book and have given it five stars for both historical accuracy and its literary form and I highly recommend reading this book.  I can't wait for the third work in this outstanding trilogy and marvel at the scope of the authors undertaking.capturing to the reader.

B005OP2928|5.0|I love all of Modern Family. This episode is one of my favorites when Cam runs down street screaming and flaring his hands. They are such a close knit and nutty family!
B0083SBMBM|4.0|We still watch it though and it appears to play better the more we use it.  Our player is able to unscramble some of the lost information when Captain America and Ironman work together to save the ship but we only lose a few seconds twice and we see the main portions.  Originally, we weren't able to see this scene at all but now it is a lot better.  The company game us a full refund when I first wrote them about the problem so I am happy and it may clear up totally.  I might buy a replacement but if it continues to clear up, I won't and then I feel I should return their money.  Either way I felt this company was great and the movie too.
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|I would like to give this a 5-star rating to offset the many negative reviews.  But, to be fair, the movie did seem low-budget, the story-line was choppy, and some of the scenes were contrived.  The acting was good because the actors (Douglas, Banderas, Tatum, Fassbender, etc.) are good and the directing solid.  As some have stated, this was a vehicle to introduce Carano.  My take on that is, she's believable as an action acter like Cynthia Rothrock and Michelle Yeoh but with much more realistic (and affective) fighting.  She is fast, tough, and brutal (those are good things).  Her character did not require a broad range of acting skills (but look at Arnold, Stallone, Strathom, etc.) but what it did require, Carano delivered.  I hope she gets the chance to show us more.<br /><br />Would like to mention one other thing.  Hollywood seems to have conditioned audiences to want hystrionics in the dialog and reactions to events.  I found the measured reponses in this movie to be much more believable.  I think the negative reviews generally reflect more on the desire of viewers to see what Hollywood has conditioned them to want to see.
B009Y2KGSQ|5.0|Everyone is skeptical of a new album from one of the great bands of our time. The first time I listened to it, I did not like it. Now that I have given it a chance, I think it may be one of their greater albums so far. Each time I listen to this album it becomes all too clear that Aerosmith has done it again. This is an amazing band and they can still rock. Tyler might not be able to scream his head off anymore, but he can still hold his own. I recommend this for any long time fan or new listener.
B005XN2ZUC|5.0|Great show! Great writing! Great characters! Great storylines..... always keeps you guessing what (or who) could happen next! I'm halfway through the first season. Can't wait to finish and get caught up for the second act.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my friend showed me this and I thought it was cool. it IS SO MUCH MONEY!!!!!!if it becomes cheaper or there is a free version I will buy it.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|This is the best 50-year-old you will ever see.  There are no gray hairs or wrinkles beyond the ones that existed in 1962.  This is the finest Blu-Ray I have, no question.  2001, Blade Runner and The Dark Knight are all excellent, but for too many reasons, Lawrence of Arabia bests them all.  The film grain is accurate.  There is little or no noise reduction nonsense or over processing.  The shallow depth of field for indoor tracking shots is keenly visible for the very first time.  Colors look accurate and Freddie Young's lighting is impeccably and naturally reproduced.  This is the way the film looked when it was first projected.  There are a few shots that look as if they were photographed yesterday.  Whatever restoration has been done, it is almost totally free of the digital monkey business that has ruined a few other releases.<br /><br />Sound is as good as you could hope.  ADR and other effects show their age, but they do fit the production time.  It's all faithful to source, which is what matters the most.<br /><br />Oh yeah, it's also one of the five greatest films of all time in case you cared.  How many films released in 2012 will live the life LoA has?  None, by my watch.  But in 2062, somebody will still be looking for Peter O'Toole behind a sandy windscreen of a jeep rolling through the Arabian desert.<br /><br />Built to last.
1449410243|5.0|I learned a lot from this book about how to tell if my cat is gay (he's not) and if he is plotting to kill me (he is).
030758836X|5.0|Loved the perspective shifts and the humor and the twists!  Yet unlike so many novels with this much going on in terms of plot, the characters and their often darkly hilarious observations were not only entertaining, but seemed weirldy (if pathologically) realistic at least until towards the end.  Perhaps a little bit of dramatic license was necessary to keep things charging along; all I can say is that it worked and I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />Can't help but think this would make an amazing movie.  Scurrying off to read more by Flynn...
B0001I55SS|3.0|It's an older movie with so,so special effects. My mom loves it because it is one of the first scifi movies she watched. It does entertain if you are into older scifi.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Didn't know what to expect.  Based on the actors involved I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised.  Would recommend this for older people to enjoy.
B003Q6D25K|1.0|This movie is dull and boring. I feel asleep numerous times. Watch a different horror film like the Shining, Rosemary's Baby, or What to Expect When You're Expecting.
B007SGM084|5.0|There was no way I couldn't have rated these books with 5 stars! 50 shades is the best trilogy ever the love between them makes you feel as if your in their relationship as well! What a girl would do for such a powerful sexy man! I recommend this book to EVERYBODY out there it is a must read!
0679805273|5.0|I got this when I was about 9 and the title always stuck with me. Every time that I have visited  new country I think to myself \\"oh, the places you'll go\\"
B008JH5CVS|4.0|The movie is a must for action fans. Witty dialogue and interesting plot.<br />The prison of the future is featured, and if it wasn't so expensive it<br />would be a good idea to store the crooks in space.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I thought this movie was good.  I was surprised that Julianne Hough could act.  I thought she did a great job.  Many other reviewers have given you the plotline and I agree with the 4-star and 5-star reviews.  I might even watch it again just for kicks.
B0034G4P94|5.0|This is actually Karen Woods writing this not my husband Bobby L. I just recently discovered Tom Hardy and only seen a few of his films. His acting ability is on the level of a Russell Crowe, no matter what character Russell is playing he inhabits that role and I find Tom Hardy is making me feel the same about him.
B000MLNUBI|5.0|I bought this watch around 6 years ago from a swatch store. It's been my almost daily watch since then. The quality is great. It is a little off with keeping time but this is normal for automatic watches. Day in and out this watch has done well and I've received many a compliment on it. A good automatic watch at a good price. No complaints whatsoever regarding either the face or the strap/clasp. Would refer to any one looking at this price point. My only complaint might be at times the crown has been hard to adjust. But it usually loosens back up after I work with it a little.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|It's been years since there was a fresh retelling of a fairy tale. A dark, romantic epic tinged with magic is what Snow White & the Huntsman aspired to. Alas, the fatal combination of a lack of chemistry and a lackluster musical score make it a somewhat pondering experience.<br /><br />The trailers make this look like an action-packed epic in the tradition of earlier box office franchises like The Lord of the Rings. There are some good things about it, like the exquisite costume designs by Colleen Atwood. Some scenes are very well written and staged, among them the infamous apple sequence. And the cast is quite good... it's just too bad they don't have better material, in the hands of a more experienced director, to work with. Sometimes films just don't work. It can be a combination of things. For me, this one fell flat. There is no chemistry between the leads. Most of the music is either nonexistent or completely underwhelming. A decent score by an A-list composer would have done wonders for a script that meanders a bit and is downright dull at times. It is full of good ideas that aren't executed to the best of abilities. It's not a good thing when you reach the climax and think, \\"Oh, good, it'll be over soon.\\"<br /><br />Out of the four other people I saw this with, two of them liked it, two were entertained but unimpressed, and I was bored. It's a matter of opinion when it comes to whether or not you'll be entertained, but either way this never reaches its full potential.
B008PWUYVA|4.0|This case from Timbuk2 is an excellent case for the Kindle Fire(original, not HD). It is very well made and appears to be made out of sturdy material. The Fire fits perfectly, nice and snug, I feel confident that it is quite safe in this case. It's very easy to open-just pull and the heavy-duty velcro releases. I like how this converts to a standing position, for easy viewing on the Fire. All in all a nice case but arrived with the interior slightly squished. However, after I actually slipped my Kindle inside, everything seemed to look OK.
B005LAIH5O|4.0|More serious scholars of Greek mythology find a lot to hate in these big-screen adaptations of classic myths, but for the easygoing audience, it's mindless fun.<br /><br />There isn't a lot of plot to this film but the momentum propels it forward. Its weaknesses are the same as in the original -- not a lot of character development, particularly among the gods. There are some rather large holes in the logic behind the script, such as how the masses have ceased praying to the gods, and why some of the gods are powerful enough to \\"end\\" other gods. (Is it because they are still prayed to, or because they are younger?) Hades switches sides frequently, although it is cool to see Zeus and he team up together to fight a common enemy toward the end. The casting of Rosamund Pike brings a nice clarity to the group and she has great chemistry with her costar. Other familiar faces pop in and out, as well as gods that appear and are just as quickly destroyed or banished. There's also some neat glimpses into creatures from Greek mythology -- one eyed giants, fire monsters, and so forth.<br /><br />Admittedly, the script is very thin but the movie isn't professing to be much more than an action film hinged around mythological aspects (and most of them are so far from the original myth as to be laughable). It never tries to be anything more than it is, and thus gives off no false sense of self-importance. It's simply fun, and now and again that's a nice thing to sit through. If you want something to sink your teeth into, look elsewhere. If you want a mindless couple of hours of pure entertainment watching some of the finest actors in the business ham it up as gods, set out to experience the \\"Wrath of the Titans.\\"
1451638450|5.0|Georgette Heyer's Cotillion meets the Addams Family -- an Addams family that has Godfather tendencies. A hero and heroine who are perceived as feckless and useless by their nearest and dearest seek their own happiness amid intergalactic family war. Add the cockiness of The 39 Steps to the banter of plays by Tom Stoppard or David Ives, as well as a bit of military adventure a la Indiana Jones, and you might approach the fun of Captain Vorpatril's Alliance. If you know any of the works I've mentioned -- or know other Bujold books -- you'll enjoy the references. However, no past reading is required to recognize and laugh with these characters, as we all know that the true term for inlaw is outlaw.
B0080CL0HM|2.0|Stories about villains are never as popular as those about heroes. Indeed, anyone writing such a story needs a credible cast in order to carry off the charm that will outweigh (at least for the audience) the deplorable behavior of any cad. Bel Ami is one such tale that would have felt more realistic with another leading man.<br /><br />I like Rob Pattinson, but here he is woefully out of his depth, possessing neither the chemistry with his costars nor the sex appeal needed to play a man like Georges. The script does him no favors and neither does the make up department, which means that through most of it, I was wondering what ever possessed the high society wives of Paris to fall for this utterly un-charming, sallow, sour-faced cad, who neither romances them nor really seduces them. Why do four of them fall into his arms? It defies all reason and is a shame, because the women are wonderful. He is just not their equal in terms of experience or charisma. This takes an otherwise gorgeous costume drama, full of beautiful clothes and exquisite period decor, down a notch and some of it can be blamed on a script that rushes so quickly onward that very little time is devoted to his relationship with any of these women.<br /><br />In some ways, the movie reminds me a bit of \\"Dangerous Liasons\\" but without the ultimate payback for this bad behavior. \\"Bel Ami\\" as the women are fond of calling him, gets away with whatever he likes, is absurdly jealous of his wife's indiscretions, seduces one woman merely to humiliate her husband, and in the end gets everything he wants through manipulation, seduction, and deceit. There really is no one to root for, since all of them are adulterous (except for the lovely Holliday Grainger, in a small but important part) and immoral, in more ways than one.<br /><br />Most costume dramas, I feel, benefit from hints rather than overt behavior. This film could have been just as beautiful (and still just as morally reprehensible) with less sexual content.ntent.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|If you're like me and check the 1-star reviews before purchasing anything, you might hesitate before buying the Kindle Edition of The Presidents Club. Multiple reviewers complain about distracting highlighting and the pages not flowing properly.  I've just completed reading The Presidents Club via Kindle on an iPad 1 and had absolutely no problems whatsoever.  Maybe the problems still exist on a hardware Kindle, or maybe Amazon replaced their servers' version of the book's file?  If you read it now on iOS, though, you should be fine.
B0072GPQNG|2.0|Sometimes I have to wonder if Stephen Spielberg is dead-set on making the most depressing movies of the decade. He has certainly succeeded in the painfully long, abhorrently abusive War Horse, a film based on a novel that if I had my way never would have been written in the first place. It's Black Beauty all over again, only worse this time around.<br /><br />How many ways can I express my hatred for this movie? By the end of it, I was so mad I went off on a ten minute rant about how the idiot who wrote the book should be shot. Is there a category for the most depressing stories ever written? If so, this one would win hands down. There are occasional moments of brevity, but really the plot just goes from one horrible thing to another. I'm an unapologetic animal lover, and it was all I could do to watch horses be flogged, shot, and worked to death in the trenches. By the time Joey runs through a battlefield and  becomes tangled up in the wire, I was downright mad.<br /><br />Yes, the cast is terrific. It includes, among others, Benedict Cumberbatch, Emma Watson, David Thewlis, and others. The music is beautiful, the camera work memorable, and it does hit a lot of emotional notes. If I could rewind time and never rent this, I'd be happy about it. Instead, I have to live with the knowledge that two and a half hours of my life were spent resenting that with all the uplifting stories Spielberg could tell with a multi-million dollar budget, he chose this one instead.

B005LAIGOQ|3.0|British authors have always loved ghost stories. They are inexpressively connected to England. In the early 1980's, another ghost story was added to the pile, and now comes to life.<br /><br />Ghost stories are not my thing. They give me the creeps, and not in a way I'd like to repeat. So my feelings about this one are mixed. From a purely writing and artistic perspective, this movie is magnificent. It builds suspense quietly and then unleashes visual horrors on a nervous audience. The cast is terrific... Radcliffe proves that he can tackle far more adult, period pieces than his famous wizard counterpart. Janet McTeer turns up as the tormented wife of Mr. Daily, suffering from visitations from her dead son. The costuming, musical score, and setting are marvelous... it blends into a chilling state of events that range from doors that open and close by themselves to  the shocking conclusion that is both beautiful and tragic. I'm also happy to say that the movie can stand on its own two feet -- it doesn't need its famous lead to succeed, although it is a joy to have him there. It's the perfect ghostly horror film.

B0099Y2YL6|5.0|After being criticized for his \\"soapy\\" second season of the British television series, Julian Fellowes takes us back to a much slower pace in Downton, full of the lovely little things that made the first season so delightful... and then crushes us.<br /><br />Criticisms of this series' predictability and tired plot twists notwithstanding, this season is less problematic with its twists than previous ones. But we still can't escape the never-ending drudgery of poor Edith, who is thwarted at every turn. I sincerely hope the writer gives her a break someday! Just when one possibility of future happiness turns up, Fellowes throws in a plot twist right out of a Bronte novel to further complicate her life. There's also a redundancy and lack of clarity in certain plot twists (such as Anna's sudden realization of Vera Bates' motives, which were obvious to us all last season). But it's always funny, always charming, and always romantic... even if it does make us cry buckets of tears before the season is out. It threatens to take one character from us, only to deviate into two shocking, unexpected deaths in a later episode.<br /><br />As always, the acting is magnificent and this season there's a lot to work with emotionally, from a death to near financial disaster and the arrival of a newborn to Downton. Maggie Smith is given all the best lines but the flirtations between Matthew and Mary are delightful to watch. In fact, there's one sneaked kiss in the first episode that is particularly fun. BUT, frankly, the last two minutes of this series are the most depressing I've ever seen. It ruined my Christmas, and have convinced me not only never to watch that episode again, but not to buy any of the seasons beyond this one. Pack the hankies, fans... you'll need them.

B009NOVCTM|4.0|While I admire the release of this collection, I won't buy it because for some inexplicable reason, The Rolling Stones, their label and management didn't have the good sense to complete the Deluxe Edition with all of their promotional music videos (as well as TV show appearances in the bonus section) in remastered form on 2 DVDs. Had they done that, I would've bought it in a heartbeat. Now, when I see it online or in stores, I can't help but shake my head. I just don't get it. The last time the band released a video compilation (way incomplete I might add), was back when VHS and Laserdiscs were all the rage. The title, \\"Video Rewind - Great Video Hits\\" was released in 1984 (3 decades ago). How tragic is that? I know MTV has turned their backs on music video by becoming a reality show channel, but I expect more from the greatest rock and roll band alive. Seeing the complete lack of any music video DVD in this new release makes me think the title of this CD collection is appropriate...\\"GRRR!\\"
B0013F1D02|5.0|I'm somebody pretty easily amused by movies, however this movie is worlds more than amusing. I have seen this move almost thirteen times now and still love every second from start to finish. It's clever writing wrapped into an incredible fantasy epic, paired with both slapstick and subtle humor. I found myself enthralled in the story and in love with the job the actors did portraying their respective parts. Though not flawless, I love this movie and believe for the  two hours of screen time it is damn well close and worth your time.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This DVD sat on my shelf for six years until I \\"retired\\" from my second career as a high school history teacher.  I regret that I waited so long to watch it.  In my first career, I spent 30 years as a field artilleryman including a tour in Vietnam.  For most of my adult life, I blamed McNamara for everything that went wrong in Vietnam and held him personally accountable for the deaths of 58,000 Americans and 100,000s of Vietnamese.  Although I remain conflicted over our involvement in Vietnam, \\"The Fog of War\\" has caused me to begin to reassess my long-held animus against McNamara.  I no longer judge him as harshly as I once did.<br />I met him twice.  Once, in India in the mid-90s while I was the defense attach&eacute; at our embassy in New Delhi, he visited as a private citizen.  The other time, I was an instructor at the Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, and he was participating in a seminar.  I am thankful that on both occasions I treated him with respect even though I felt he had blood on his hands.<br />My bottom line is that I now feel that McNamara was a selfless public servant who tried to make the best possible decisions based on the information available.  Alas, the information was often flawed and incomplete, and some of those decisions were tragically wrong.  We also have to remember that the Vietnam War took place in the larger context of the Cold War and concurrent with a tumultuous domestic scene.  Even so, McNamara will remain a polarizing figure in American history for decades to come.

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This is a great movie for any Marvel comic fan because everything comes to life!  The cast is superb and the action, special effects and costumes are wonderful!  I really like the WWII setting, far-fetched, of course, but still so very fun to watch!  Captain America has always been my favorite, being the first, and always a true Patriot!
B0090NNQX6|5.0|There is this perfect moment on \\"Step With Me\\" that makes me feel so blissful I close my eyes and smile, carried away on the kind of innocence that takes you back to childhood. The song is pretty and hopeful and reminds me of the carefree happiness of 60s and 70s bubble gum pop.<br /><br />If this were the only track on the album that was wonderful, Mika would still remain one of my musical heroes. But so much on here is really, really good, personifying pop music in ways that seem to escape most other artists right now.<br /><br />Origin of Love is a great title for a cd that is pretty much all about love, whether we're embracing it on \\"Step With Me,\\" \\"Origin of Love\\" and \\"Stardust\\" or defying it on \\"Love You When I'm Drunk\\" and \\"Lola\\" (never has anyone sounded like he's having so much fun making sure he won't fall in love as on the adorably catchy \\"Lola.\\")<br /><br />Mika's albums always put me in good spirits, but of all of the songs on here that remain faithful to his impish, free will spirit none is quite so nice or as meaningful as the upbeat message about being true to yourself on \\"Popular Song.\\"<br /><br />Everyone needs a go-to album for those days when the sun isn't shining. Mika's Origin of Love is definitely one of them! :)

0547564651|3.0|Paul Tough writes that &quot;the most reliable way to produce an adult who is brave and curious and kind and prudent is to ensure that when he is an infant, his hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) functions well.&quot;<br /><br />If the HPA isn't fostered in early childhood - mostly due to the toxic stresses of deep poverty - the child will probably fail at school and in life. Turns out, success isn't character-based at all; it's chemical.<br /><br />So when Tough opens his book with a kindergarten class learning the Tools of the Mind curriculum - a theory of child development that emphasizes cognitive skills - it's already too late for a majority of HPA-disabled kids, the negative effects of which will accrue like compounding interest throughout their school years.<br /><br />I thought this book was fascinating but confusing and misguided. Tough already knows what matters for success since he wrote about it in his first book, &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; which featured Geoffrey Canada trying to end the cycle of generational poverty with his Harlem Children's Zone concept in NYC.<br /><br />For Canada, family, community and health are the cornerstones for what Tough in this book calls character. To prove his character /chemical thesis, all Tough had to do was a followup on Canada's HCZ concept of beginning intensive family support in the pre-birth and first three years of a Harlem-born child.<br /><br />Finally, Tough confuses the identity crises of the middle class experiences - including his own - with the character/HPA crises of the deep poverty underclass. This book, with its 5 main chapters and 55 sub chapters, is not a sum of its parts and only earns 3 stars from this frustrated reader.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read it in a day could not put it down. Absolutely addicting book and story line.<br />If you liked the Fifty shades trilogy you will love this series.
B00555X8OA|4.0|Gives a deep insight to our daily behavior and choice making.<br />Written in a clear and simple manner without compromising on the scientific depth and accuracy.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Very foul language and hateful relationships and that after only a few pages!  I think I'll take my $15 loss and move on.
B000YHG72E|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing a real holiday treat it's a classic!!! My family watches Elf multiple times every year and we decided it was time to get the BLU Ray version. Will Ferrell is PERFECT as a naive, trusting and inexpiernced person.  You can't go wrong watching this movie!  Good for everyone!!!
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Really have enjoyed this series and the previous year as well.  This is well produced, with great character development.  If you like American History with a special interest in the 20's, this is worth a look.  Just very entertaining to me...mob oriented prohibition era.
B0074Y2YZ4|5.0|Whilst Roxette's previous album Charmed School needed to grow on you through repeated playing, Travelling grips you by the ear with its upbeat nature from the first song.  Travelling is very different sounding to Charmed School and definitely different to Look Sharp and Joyride their most successful chart wise albums that made these two a household name at the peak of their career in the late 80s/early 90s.  When you hit the play button on Travelling it sounds like Roxette is simply celebrating life.  The apprehensive times that were around when the more slower paced at time depressing previous album was written are clearly over, the hurdle of if Marie will make a successful recovery and comeback from her brain surgery and be able to contribute to both the studio songs and live at concerts to the extent she is happy with, has obviously been jumped over and is clearly evident in these songs.  Travelling is just pure fun, it's an album that shouts \\"We're Back!\\"  For that, if you've been a fan throughout this duo's career, you can't help but instantly like it and want to celebrate with Per, Marie and the lesser known band members.<br /><br />A lot of the initial songs have a bit of a Beatles era sound to them, Marie is even wearing a Beatles shirt in the cover insert photos, and even Cat Stevens seems to have been a bit in Per's mind by the time he wrote the fifth song Easy Way Out.  It's a bit puzzling why they put two versions of It's Possible on here (tracks 6 and 14) when they are virtually identical sounding.  The only difference lyric wise is the end of the sentence often repeated throughout the song \\"When you give me that look I just wanna oh oh oh,\\" changes to \\"When you give me that look I just wanna let it show,\\" the second time round.  Not a bad song, but not sure it warrants being on here twice instead of some other new song or live version or rerecording of an old song that might have missed the cut.<br /><br />Rerecordings of Stars as well as It Must Have Been Love are included on Travelling, a similar project to what Roxette did on their Tourism album.  Both work well here.  I really like what they did with It Must Have Been Love on here with the addition of a Rotterdam orchestra adding brass sounds as well as a drum intro to the old song.  Even though the lyrics are still the same the song sounds different enough that you don't instantly picture the Pretty Woman film clip that you do when the original version plays, which is nice as it lets you really appreciate the lyrics.<br /><br />She's Got Nothing on (But the Radio) is on here as a live version performed in front of a crowd in Rio De Janero.  I actually think this song sounds better live than it did on Charmed School.  This album was made on the road during their world tour where obviously this song was performed to promote their new album, the crowd cheers more so than sings the words, possibly because a large portion of them had never heard it before, being that it really didn't do anything impact wise on the charts.<br /><br />This album also comes with the lyrics to all the songs in the CD insert and some photos performing, in hotels and things like this.  It's a nice sounding album, probably more of something you'll put on in the background when working or surfing the net rather than forcing you to get up and dance or pretend your singing or playing guitar such as you no doubt did (or maybe that was just me) with songs like The Look, Dressed for Success, Joyride, Dangerous, The Big Love and How Do You Do from their earlier albums.Been Love are included on Travelling, a similar project to what Roxette did on their Tourism album.

B002JI94J4|2.0|I was really disappointed in the quality of this Blu-ray.  I bought it thinking that the quality would be better then the DVD.  As it turns out we prefer the DVD.
B004OZZ624|5.0|enjoyed it not sure where it was going to go, it did have me on the edge of my seat
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I was recommended this book by my sister.  I have to say I really enjoyed it.  Though parts of the story were predictable, I thought the description of the slave's lives and their hierarchy on the plantation was well defined.  The story highlights the dilemma of the slaves plight in life, and it is sad how little their lives and families meant to most of the white population.  It is well worth a read.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|A great continuation of The Lost Hero's story, with a real heart wrenching turn. I can't wait for the next book in this series!
B008KE3960|5.0|get this game nuff said ya know how that game with towers and ball thingies are fun? well this game is like that but with planes and tanks.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|When Somewhere Over the Rainbow was releases Pre Album, I had it on repeat until this the album came out. Hearing her sing is ,to me, like having a singing lesson. Her phrasing, purity of tone, range and control are mind blowing and in evidence throughout this album. Not a \\"skip this one\\" on the collection. I have loved all her albums but this is the one I have waited for and I am not dissapointed. In fact, I am beyond overjoyed. Hope she does a 2nd complilation of this type of music. It is what she was born to sing.
0765322889|5.0|The world, characters, and plot of this series is amazing. The books only get better after Gardens of the Moon.
1451613512|5.0|Picked this up at B&N and was fascinated by the things Oliver Stone exposed/brought to light in this book. I don't really read books like this, but it seems important to know what's going on that the general public may not know. Definitely worth a look-see!
B0070UFMOW|2.0|I purchased this product on August 2nd, 2012 and am now dealing with both the seller and manufacturer (FiiO) because the auxillary plug has failed.  I've switched out the L9 LOD cable as well as tried the amp on several other devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod), all with the same result.  No sound through my Westone's unless I wiggle the jack until it makes the right contact point with the aux plug.  Then I only get sound out of one ear.  The seller is requesting an additional $37.50 to replace the unit since their warranty only lasts 30 days.  I'm waiting on FiiO to respond with their remedy.  I find it unacceptable that the unit has failed within 3 months of purchase.<br /><br />With that being said, when working, the amp functions very well - especially for the price.  I was not looking for a more sophisticated amp to start with, and I definitely feel as if I got more than what I paid for.  There was a definite improvement in sound output from my Westone's.  I just wished it worked.<br /><br />I would have a difficult time recommending this product, only because of the quality issue I've just discussed.
B00A6S5RPY|5.0|There are a lot of tears in the great Saul Bass opening credits and you find out why later in the film....the story is a little strange: David Niven plays a smooth talking father who cannot be faithful to any woman he is with--his teenage daughter calls him by his first name and seems to have no problem with what he is doing....very interesting film.... The video on the blu-ray is very good--mostly in color, with black and white thrown in here and there....the b/w sections of the film were supposedly filmed on color stock and then had the color removed, so these sections of the film look different from the usual b/w....the audio is very clear, and overall, a very good film....beautiful scenery, great score.... Excellent....except for David Niven's short shorts....and the girlie way he wears some of his shirts....
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read the first part the hunger games and decided to read this next book It is a really good book to read.
0345803485|1.0|This erotic story starts very inviting, it is a quick read & it'll trap you, however, after reading half the book I found myself reading about the exact same sex scene with the exact same words over & over & over again. The characters really lack a lot!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a really exciting book to read! I couldn't put it down once I started!. Will read the next book Catching Fire.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I really like this app because I can see in a quick glance how my outdoor activities will be affected by day and week.<br /><br />Pros: Lots of Information about weather, alerts about weather are nice.  Lots of ways to look at weather forecast (day, week, 10 days, hourly, etc)<br />Cons: Battery drains a little faster than normal.  Screens are a little too busy, but needed.<br /><br />Possible enhancements recommendation: It would be nice to have tides for coastal locations.
B004I4M0A2|1.0|I love ikea,but this app just plane won't work. I get a list of cattagorys all with no content. tried deleteing and reinstaling. no cange. a useless app.
B004WMKSH2|1.0|Amazon instant video doesn't play on droid devices. Netflix does. Makes it a pretty easy choice. Amazon needs to upgrade.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Good movie, did not follow book as close as I'd like, but that's what happens when a book gets made into a movie. Really good special effects, and good acting. This isn't like a life changer, but its a good movie to watch. I'd watch it again.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|Loving the album.  Must Listens are \\"Let There Be Love,\\" Red Hot Kinda Love,\\" and \\"Your Body.\\"  Other good ones are \\"Army of Me,\\" \\"Circles,\\" & \\"Shut Up.\\"<br /><br />I wish the album haden't been published Edited.  Your Body is edited as well as Shut up has bleeps over words and blanks out other words.  Circles is Explicit (which is awesome), I just wish more songs had not been edited.
B00005JN8Z|3.0|A number of films have been made of this book.  This performance was the latest at the time and the most lavish.  The book was very much more bloodthirsty than the film, which had the most horrific episodes watered doen for obvious reasons.  The acting by Peter Ustinov was fantastic.  An entertaining film.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Bought the America version of this DVD having read the negative reviews on the English release having been \\"edited\\" to remove a particular scene.  I grew up with Marvel comics and have followed and thoroughly enjoyed their live-action transition to the big-screen over recent years.  The Avengers really lives up to all the hype.  It builds on the previous solo outings (Thor, Captain America etc) - which are also to be highly commended - to deliver a well-structured, thoroughly entertaining action adventure fest, well acted and with some delicious comic asides.  This is exactly what a super-hero movie should be - bring on Iron Man 3, Avengers 2 etc!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|THe music is very good and the production and singer/actors are terrific.  It is a sequel to Phantom of the Opera.

B0099Y2YL6|3.0|So here we are in Season Three.<br />Yes, I'm still watching, ...I have a lot of time invested in this series, .....but I must admit to some personal decreasing in my original appreciation of this show.<br /><br />Very much enjoyed Season One,...Season Two not so much, ....and the less said about the execrable \\"Christmas Special\\" the better!<br />The \\"snow dome\\" Cinderella ending, together with the over-kill of Hallmark Greeting card sentiment caused me some serious doubt as to my ability to pursue this ever-expanding franchise any further.<br /><br />Despite those reservations, ...I weakened and against any better judgement, bought Series Three.<br />Now straight away I'll post a few warnings.<br />DO be sure to bring your gumboots. (More on this later)<br />DO prepare yourself for a shock with regards to Ms. Maclaine.<br />DO prepare yourself for the some clich&eacute; and highly predictable story lines.<br />Those precautions out of the way, prepare yourself to once again enter the world of the denizens of Downton.<br /><br />Downton has always been about the privileges of the rich.<br />So shock horror, ...opening Episode One, Series Three?<br />Yes, Downton is faced with financial ruin and may have to be sold, and the family moved to one of their lesser \\"hunting lodges\\", ..which of course looks like a multi-million dollar property usually advertised in the glossy pages of \\"Country Life\\". Poor dears! AND only eight servants mind you, for a family now down to just three! (The daughters at this stage are presumed to all be safely \\"married off\\".<br />Now PLEASE don't start whinging about \\"spoilers\\"!<br />If this hoary old well-trodden plot line comes as anything of a surprise to you then you are indeed under some sort of dementia, ....or just haven't read very much.<br />And of course, you just KNOW that it will all be saved, ....but the deus-ex-machina contrived to save the day is VERY highly improbable to say the least!<br />In truth it's about as believable as a seven dollar note!<br /><br />Secondly, ...remember those gumboots I told you to bring?<br />Well of course there's Lady Mary's wedding to watch, isn't there?<br />You know that weddings are always put into soaps to boost ratings and this one, ...and almost another nuptial are no exceptions.<br />Yes, the dresses, yes the flowers, and yes the pre-marital jitters....(of course!)<br />Lady Mary herself goes through a not so flattering case of those, ......and when she is unable to find a shark anywhere on the extensive grounds of Downton, she opts for jumping the gun instead.<br />Please ensure all gumboots are securely fastened right now, as the syrup and treacle in the \\"make up\\" get REALLY thick, and wading through the laid-on sentiment can be heavy going if you're wearing your street shoes.<br />Surprise, surprise, the bride eventually comes down looking \\"virginal\\", ...well as much in that state as you can after a man has shuffled off his mortal coil while enjoying your sexual favours in bed....<br />(Again, ...NO complaints about spoilers!

It's truly more like \\"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane\\"!<br />And ready yourself for every clich&eacute; (there's THAT word again!) in stereotype regarding rich Americans abroad that's possible to drag out. (Border line offensive really.)<br />Maclaine channels the Unsinkable Mollie Brown so shamelessly she seems to have landed on the wrong side of the Atlantic after that ship went down.<br />Plus the fact she seems to have so very little to do! Her casting obviously comes at some cost and yet the script sees her add nothing of consequence to the story line, then after one and a half episodes, she just disappears!

She also seems to be incredibly deaf. People pass VERY derogatory comments about her within feet that she apparently does not hear, ...and yet she appears incredibly alert everywhere else?<br /><br />Elisabeth McGovern STILL tilts her head benignly and stares through her eye-brows at everybody. A technique she has employed continually ever since series One, so that much hasn't changed.<br />Bates also still spends his time looking grim. That particular expression will require plastic surgery to remove after he's finished this gig...<br /><br />Thomas is still the conniving cad, although this time the twist(?) sees his usual partner in crime ( O'Brien) as his vehement opponent rather than his side-kick.<br />I shouldn't criticise this, as it's probably one of the few original ideas Fellowes comes up with, and does create some suspense as to what will happen next.<br />I will spare you any genuine spoilers, (few though they could be!) from the remainder of the series.<br /><br />Yes, the whole thing still LOOKS very beautiful, ...the costumes are truly magnificent, but we are supposed to believe Downton is SO flat broke that it has to be sold and yet the women order dresses that cost the \\"national debt\\" (sic), there are myriad OTT floral arrangements everywhere outdoing any Royal Wedding, ....food that would rival Tour d'Argent, and champagne constantly flowing like the Ganges?<br />If this is \\"broke\\" then I'd hate to see penury....<br />Mention must also be made of the continued overuse of that \\"ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding\\" supremely irritating musical theme.

B008XG1X18|3.0|like the new secret board feature but not as easy on kindle as it is on clunky old desktop browser.
B000MKD9P6|4.0|The story line is  not the mot exciting in the world.  You might even be able to call it somewhat bland and predictable.  But, I found it entertaining and enjoyable nonetheless.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I enjoyed this latest of Grisham's books.  Suspense, a few twists - I did not anticipate all of them.  Fun book.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I bought a red Marware Standing Case for my Kindle Fire HD 7\\".  It is beautiful and quite sturdy.  I'm very happy with it.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|The musical content has been reviewed elsewhere but there has been some discussion over which digital transfers have been used for this box. I am in the UK and have now played each disc through Windows Media Player (which includes an HDCD decoder). I can report that 'Song to a Seagull', 'Clouds', 'Ladies.....', 'Blue' and 'Don Juan's....' are HDCD encoded discs. These then would appear to be the versions that have been widely available and stickered as 'digitally remastered' since around 2002. The other discs are not HDCD encoded so could well be transfers from the 80s or early 90s. I think this reflects the state of play as regards to the CDs available individually in the UK and supports the theory that the label have simply collected the current CD offerings to make this bargain set. It is true that this box has not been specially remastered but there are not more recent versions of these discs available (for better or worse) as far as I know.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have always been a huge John Grisham fan.  The Racketeer is a book reminiscent of \\"The Firm\\".  The plot moves along at a quick pace and the way John paints word pictures makes you feel as though you have a front row seat.  This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time.  I want to see a sequel because you just know the main character has more things to do.  Terrific book, I enjoyed this so much!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are ok but the fun is trying to unlock more games. My only complaint (and it's a big complaint) are all the pop-up ads. I don't mind the ones at the bottom but there are too many full-screen pop-ups. In addition some close on top others say skip which makes it difficult and frustrating or my 4-year old who really likes the game.
1451613512|5.0|When I bought this book, I was completely intimidated by the size of it! It's a brick. But, once I got reading, I flew through it. The sheer breadth of information covered is astronomical, but I couldn't put it down. I encourage those who like a meaty read to pick this one up. Five stars.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it really entertained me. my only problem though was that you would have to pay actual money if you were to buy more coins. good game though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing I'm ready to get started on the next one.. far better than the movie but that was expected. I would recommend this to everybody!
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Got the \\"Friends\\" boxed blu ray set today and I love it!<br /><br />I know the controversy surrounding the release of this set, but it honestly does not phase me. When I first saw the episodes when they aired, these were the versions I saw. When the DVD set came out, yes, it was a wonderful bonus to have the extended episodes...but that was it, a bonus. I intend to keep my DVD box set of the complete series, so I can revisit the extended episodes as I wish...but the difference in picture and sound on these blu ray discs is amazing...just like seeing them again for the first time.<br /><br />As of this writing, I have only watched 2 of the first season episodes. I have watched the bonus disc in its entirety.<br /><br />What's in the box:<br />First off, the box is made of a VERY sturdy, thick glossy cardboard. The cover is a lenticular cover which shows the cast in the first season at one angle, and the last season at another angle. This box is held shut by magnets and opens like a chest. When opened, you will find a glossy 40 page episode guide inside with a synopsis of each episode, photos from the episodes, and some cool extra photos. Underneath this booklet, there is another very sturdy cardboard book that houses the 21 discs. There are 2 discs per page with the bonus disc being by itself on the last page of the book. The book is also held closed with magnets as the box is. A ribbon is attached to the inside of the box with these items resting on top of it, so pulling the ribbon raises the items up for easy removal.<br /><br />What's on the bonus disc:<br />Friends From the Start: Approx 30 min, features the creation/origins of \\"Friends\\" with many of the creators of the show discussing how the show started, casting, creating the sets, etc.<br />When Friends Become Family: Approx 30 min, again featuring creators discussing how everything came together and how the show exploded into the culture<br />Legacy of Friends: Approx 12 min, focuses on the impact that \\"Friends\\" had and still has, and shows some emotional footage of the filming of the last episode and tearing down the set<br />Producer's Cut of \\"The One Where Rachel Tells Ross\\": Approx 24 min, this is the originally planned/filmed episode that was filmed prior to the 9/11 attacks, featuring a sub-plot where Chandler makes a joke about having a bomb as he and Monica are about to board the plane for their honeymoon.<br />Original Script for \\"The One Where Rachel Tells Ross\\", just as described<br />Music Video for The Rembrandts' \\"I'll Be There for You\\"<br />Short clips of \\"Friends\\" on \\"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\\", approx 15 min. Features clips of David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry on \\"Ellen\\", each appearing individually<br />Short clips of \\"Friends\\" on \\"The Tonight Show\\", approx 23 min. Features the men of \\"Friends\\" first, sitting with Jay Leno on a recreation of the Central Perk set, discussing the ride of being on the show. The women appear next, then the men are brought out for a full reunion. This was filmed not long after the airing of the final episode, so it's not anything new.<br />Previously Unreleased Gag Reel, approx 8 min.<br /><br />I, for one, am thrilled to have bought this. I think some people may be confusing \\"broadcast\\" with \\"syndicated\\", so just for the record, these are the original broadcast episodes. There is nothing cut from when they originally aired. The episodes on the DVD had footage ADDED to them that was never shown before. Again, I will keep my DVD box set to watch the extended episodes from time to time, but the blu rays will be my main \\"go to\\" for the show as they look and sound fantastic in high def.<br /><br />I have uploaded photos of the box and contents.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|Excellent quality for this movie. The best part was the documentary \\"Terror in the Aisles\\" which I have been looking for some time now.  I remember seeing it as a kid in the theater and wanted for my collection. Film and documentary had clear stunning picture quality, above average audio. Overall very happy with my purchase!
0307346617|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but one has to remember what it is: a collection of short anecdotes rather than a single story or a couple of interwoven stories.  As a result, there are no characters or plot to follow.  Instead, what you get are many different snippets of story that form an overall picture.<br /><br />I liked this format because the various snippets contains many creative ideas about a wide variety of aspects of what it would be like to live through this kind of zombie war.  I think this book works best if you read it in smaller chunks, rather than straight through.  Part of what I enjoyed about the book was thinking about the ideas presented during the time that I wasn't reading, and using my imagination to play out the ideas presented.<br /><br />It is going to be very interesting to see how they adapted this book into the movie that is coming out.  There are enough different creative ideas in this book to provide the plots for dozens of movies, each focusing on a different aspect of the overall story.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer is an excellent read. I couldn't put it down. Another Grisham masterpiece. Revenge at it's best. A change from the \\"legal\\" themes of the past.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is one of his best, if not the best! I had read all his books but,<br /><br />I have not read John for several years. But he is still an incredible author.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Some songs different from the movie, but a great listen and sing along cd for the car. Takes me right back to the movie.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game on kindle fire and it doesnt mess up at all but  the price should be a little bit lower
B009XY97VC|2.0|Invincible is by far the very best of over 6 albums by Two Steps from Hell that I have had the pleasure to listen too. Archangel is rather good as well. However Skyworld is so different from anything Two Steps from Hell has ever released before as to sound totally foreign. One track is a republished track and should be familiar to all those who have listened to Archangel. While a number of tracks have promise too them they are lack luster compared to previous works by Two Steps from Hell. Other tracks are hardly the wonderful soaring imaginative music we have come to expect from the team, instead are jarring, less than pleasant attempts to create something new and failing.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I am not by a long shot a romance buff but I read this book for the same reason many did, to see exactly what all the hype is about. The book was OK. Greys life is anything but boring so the storyline keeps you captivated and wondering what's going to happen next, besides the sex which came every few pages and was pretty predictable. Less sex and more action would've been ideal for me, but overall a good read
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters were so well written and likable. I didn't want to put it down, it held my interest that well but, I was disappointed in the ending. I felt very disjointed and hung out there. I plan on reading another book written by this author to compare!
B004J4WN0I|4.0|This book had a habit of throwing me, not because it was badly written at all, but because the tone was very similar to the female snark you see in a lot of urban fantasy heroines. The tone was odd coming from a guy, but once I was able to just ignore that little bit of dissonance, I fell right in with a highly enjoyable story. The plot was well tangled and well sorted out by the end, Oberon was just fantastic, and I love the potential for more stories. Serious reading, this is not, but it definitely hit the mark for entertaining and amusing.<br /><br />I have to note, however, that this book was recommended to me as a \\"you might also like\\" on the Dresden Files. This is nothing, nothing, nothing like Butcher. The humor is much lighter and less pointed, in my opinion, the character is very different, the environment is much lighter and less serious, and about the only things they have in common are male main characters and an urban setting. Not bad, just very, very different.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|can not get it to open, caused my tablet to crash, after that i still attempted to reload however my apps located on the amazon site states i already have ABSW i just need to open it, very frustrating and a waste of  time and not a good one.Don't bother attempting to download until they have worked out the bugs, such a disapointment my kids were really looking forward to this game and truthfully so ws i.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when you think you know where this book is going...you don't. The characters draw you in as you pity, love, hate and scorn them. It is impossible to read this novel and not get drawn into taking sides. As you flip flop through the shambles of a marriage, the global financial crisis and mix this with a whole lot of crazy you get a book you will not be able to put down.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a most interesting novel as you were at first not sure from whose perspective it was coming from.  As the reader it becomes captivating as you are introduced to the mystery surrounding the characters.  Certainly a page turner.
B007FEGH7Y|4.0|This is a very different kind of band.  Not really known yet. But if u want to try something new give them a chance. I did
B002RKSZS0|3.0|I really, really wanted to like this book, but it was very predictable. I felt like I knew exactly what was coming after reading the first few pages.<br /><br />I understand that different eras of authors produce different stories and plots, but this is one classic that I find less than memorable. The characters were charming, but all followed a predictable route.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good plot-twister, I would recommend looking elsewhere.
B0028T6XXY|3.0|I don't care for the way the producers put the concert on the DVD.  They skip his concerts back and forth for every song.  Too confusing and not enjoyable, but I can still listen to him sing.  Didn't appreciate his mouth when he was giving background on his life etc.
B004SBB0LU|5.0|Having purchased this snd the rest of the Queen albums I have been able to replace my cassettes with the CDs and am very pleased with not only the boxset but with the efficiency of yourselves and relevant distributors of the whole process. Many thanks
B005EGY8EE|5.0|Great movie! Something that as a family we love sitting down and watching together!  We liked the movie so much this dvd was bought as a gift for my husband and thats saying something!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|This movie was so bad I couldn't finish watching it. I was really disappointed because Alec Baldwin cracks me up, but it was so bad I didn't laugh at any of it. It just sucked!

1439190275|3.0|Really,<br /><br />I've done everything religiously for 5 weeks and my results so for is a n abysmal 5 lousy pounds. Book worked the 1st time I did the diet 5 years ago, but for whatever my reason, It just isn't working as well this time around.<br /><br />My wife is getting annoyed to boot! My breath stinks! They say you go through this metamorphasis stage, before you actually loose the weight. Part of this process includes stanky breath and escessive flatulance. And I thought Fido stank us out at night!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Before purchasing The Godfather Collection, I had never watched the movies in their entirety. After watching them, I'm not sure why I waited so long to buy it. I purchased it when it was the deal of the day...and to this date it may go down as the best purchase I have ever made. True story.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|The amazon app is a solid app that keeps you from going to the full html site. Has the minimum information needed to keep the app fast.
B0093URN4E|4.0|I will probably loose several places in my top reviewer score for not giving this 5 stars, but to give it five stars would make it equal to You Fail Me, in my book, and I can't do that.<br /><br />This is the raw visceral/animal side of Converge, much like the beloved Jane Doe album. I'm an idiot though, because my first introduction to Converge was when I bought Jane Doe expecting it to be the female rapper of that name. That's right, I'm stupid. Well, it grew on me since I was already familiar with Napalm Death and the extreme side of heavy music in general.<br /><br />Years later, I now own every album they have put out since Jane Doe, and I think maybe one that came before. You Fail Me is my favorite, because the lyrics are very intense poetry all on their own, and the music has a lot of drama between slower and faster parts, as well as other characteristics that fluctuate more than Jane Doe did. I consider JD to be very consistently blistery.<br /><br />I presume the similarity between this new album and Jane Doe (which seems their most popular album), has much to do with why this new album is being so well received among fans and critics alike. The band deserve that praise, but for me this album doesn't change-up enough to really make the heavy parts hit extra hard. Instead it has the effect of Jane Doe where I have to listen repeatedly to get calloused enough to the harshness before the various parts gain distinction. However, I prefer the side of them that is more like hardcore, and less like classic metal tropes. I think they only fall into somewhat classic metal mode on maybe 1-2 songs this time, so that's not too bad.<br /><br />I read the lyrics to this album sort of torn; they end on a pretty strong 2-3 poem/song run, and I sense that the topics being written about are very close to home for them. However, the way these ideas are being written in the lyrics is a little plain with a lot of trite phrasing. I'm sorry, because I know you all love this album, and you should; these guys have never been better in terms of their chops and arrangements, but the heartbreak and suicide themes in You Fail Me were such classic themes, compared to this \\"Every Rose Has It's Thorn\\" (almost an actual lyric here, check it out before you hate) or \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" theme of being on the road and missing home, and all the baggage that comes with that. I know it gets a lot darker than simple homesickness, but I sort of think printing the lyrics so clearly this time somewhat backfired. I might have assumed they were different had I not been able to asses them so easily.<br /><br />Lyrics aside, the packaging is gorgeous, so don't you dare download it instead of getting an old-school disc. It has a really sharp foil inlay on matte cardboard in a very slim fold, with a small foldout poster of Jack Bannon's fantastic graphics, opposite the full lyrics in poem form and even divided by song titles. No matter if you think this is the best or worst of his actual graphics, the treatment is great here.<br /><br />The riffing is crazy though; every single guitar note, guitar chord, drum hit, and vocal riff is perfectly syncopated and skull-crushingly heavy. This would be a great introduction to them for new fans, because it really shows their main style. I missed them in concert recently, but I get the feeling it's a lot like this, based on what others have said., and you should; these guys have never been better in terms of their chops and arrangements, but the heartbreak and suicide themes in You Fail Me were such classic themes, compared to this \\"Every Rose Has It's Thorn\\" (almost an actual lyric here, check it out before you hate) or \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" theme of being on the road and missing home, and all the baggage that comes with that.

B005IQZB14|5.0|Gripping story of this woman's quest to find herself by hiking the Pacific Coast trail. She had minimal hiking experience and could have abandoned her goal along the way. I found it hard to put the book down. My feet hurt as she described the damage being done to her toes from hiking in boots too small.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|It needs to have special credits to Amazon for an incredibly fast delivery time - to Hong Kong - I opted for the standard shipping (which supposed to be 16 days) but I received the box in 2 days after the release!  Comparing to normal orders, I found pre-orders normally delivered much faster (same experience for my Doors Vinyl box and Miles Davis Complete Box pre-orders, normally within a week even though standard shipping chosen).<br /><br />For the packaging, the carton box was still in good shape when received, and for sure, the color box surrounded by protective bubble chains was also perfectly presented.<br /><br />Going back to the sound quality, I tried serveral discs which were definitly far better than my 1978-Australian blue box since they have been hardly played and worn out already.  But if you need detailed resolution analysis, that is out of the capability of my equipment.<br /><br />Sleeve printing were also perfect, smooth, without any stains and scratches (don't take that for granted as my Doors vinyl box got stains and scratches when opened!)<br /><br />For the 252-page book, no need to described again how beautiful it was and how the graphic were accurately printed.  One point to note was that in the final 2 sections, it explained how the remasters were created and how the vinyls were pressed which showed the passions from the engineersing team.  The book ends with a final conclusion to remind us, appreciate the technical results, and, enjoy the music. That's always true.
B0041KVZ1I|2.0|Upon reading a lot of negativity, I was skeptical, because we have to be negative first, this is what get's the pot stirring.....  .Aside from having 4,5,6 of the Beatles various pressings, I, a Beatles \\"lifer\\" couldn't resist the temptation to lose/drop $$$ on four lp's so far, Abbey Road, Magical Mystery Tour, Pepper's, and  The White album. MMT is super on my Shure V15-III loud clear vibrant etc. Abbey Road played as back round was ok.... later played under \\"louder\\" conditions, the background noise almost drowned out the music.... , no fuzz on the needle!!! Two cleanings later and this record sounds as if it has been played 4,000 times,,,ARE THEY SERIOUS, No this is not just my copy, you can see for yourself!!!! I'm afraid to open the other two........
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The book was great!  I would have enjoyed this much more if the next book in the series would be in before may of 2013!!  I will forget all about it by that point.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|She has really developed and grown up in this new album. It really shows that she has been able to keep her sound and yet is full of energy and more powerful than her past albums. I got this as an MP3, and would recommend it to anyone.

141659521X|5.0|[[ASIN:B007HACDLK The Last Man: A Novel]] is a compelling story that gripped me right from the start. He brilliantly executed it in a manner that provided a constant flow of suspense, all prerequisites for  a good thriller. His characters are well-developed and portray their human sides in a manner that make them so true to life. This is a book of smooth writing, fabulous descriptions, amazing dialogue and gripping pacing, which are the elements that made this story an accomplished piece of writing. In many ways, Mitch Rapp reminds me of  Jason Bourne in the [[ASIN:0553593544 The Bourne Identity (Jason Bourne Book #1): A Novel]] and Gavin in [[ASIN:B00413QFKG Triple Agent, Double Cross]]. His character is well-developed and very real.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kept my interest, well written, great story with a twist.  Would recommend for a great beach read for the female reader.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't wait to read the next one! The book is very thoughtfully written but easy to read. Katniss will steal your heart.
B009VB9VKY|4.0|Not bad. The dancing was Kool. Wish I could move like that. Story was ok. I would give it a 3.5 but decided to go with a 4.
B003WEA4UM|3.0|I enjoyed Cloud Atlas overall but feel that it didn't live up to the cleverness of the story telling or writing. I really enjoyed the way the various stories and time lines were crafted and intertwined, the writing (with the exception of Sloosha) and characters as well crafted and fleshed out.<br /><br />My two biggest problems with the book were that I didn't like Frobisher so this made his story hard to get into as I had no investment in the main character and the real down fall of Cloud Atlas is Sloosha. Sloosha fails on so many levels. The post-apocalyptic language is painful to read, the pacing is really bad and being the only story to be read from start to finish it feels very long.<br /><br />The shining star is Adam Ewing. His story was the one that I found to be the most compelling and revealing of the major themes that David Mitchell is trying to express. The ideals of man's transcendence, equality and the beauty of life are most clearly expressed in this narrative.<br /><br />Timothy Cavendish was good comic relief and Mrs. Rey provides a boost of energy.<br /><br />A good read that challenges at points and almost to a fault at times.
1469984202|5.0|I absolutely loved these stories.  It's five books in one - and you get your money's worth.  The book will leave you hanging and keep you wanting more.  I highly recommend these books.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love everything about this show.  Its costumes, settings, the characters, stories are all awsome.  Would highly recommend.  I watched the first season and I was hooked.  Had to buy second season.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|This album is wonderful.  It shows her talents - ranging from the ultimate power ballad, to the songs that just make you wanna dance.  Beyonce is, and I'm sure always will be, my favorite female artist.  Her emotions shine through her music - and I love it!
B0091REZMW|2.0|this WOULD be a fun game if you could EARN DIAMONDS.  and the prices to buy diamonds are RIDICULOUS!  overall.... suck.
B003Y5H574|5.0|This movie was just perfect.  It gives you something to laugh about, something to cry about, and something to get angry about.  It features real life situations, and you love the characters.  Not to mention, there's some major eye candy.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Anything about Kay Scarpetta is a favorite of mine. Patricia Cromwell is one of my favorite authors. I have followed Kay Scarpetta for years and eagerly look for a new book with Lucy,Marino and Benton.
B000TETD9Q|5.0|Beautiful!  Many of the songs brought me back to when I was younger.  Brian is amazing!  Mike still has it and the voices are harmonious heaven!
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Boardwalk Empire is a rich and complex examination of human strengths and weaknesses.  It does not indulge in violence for violence's sake, which I find so tedious.  Well done!
0812984412|1.0|Way too much time invested reading a book that just drags on and on.  Some of the characters on their own were interesting, but then we were done with them and on to a new cast of characters.  A couple of plots are O.K., but with this book they just keep coming.  The thread that binds all of this together is also mighty thin.
1469984202|5.0|What a great sci fi!  I haven't read such an original, captivating  sci fi in a long time, and I have been reading sci fi for almost 50 years.  The characterization was great, the world setting was unique and fully developed, the plot pulled you right along.  I was a little hesitant when my book reader said 1257 pages...it could have been twice as long.  Don't wait- you will love Wool!  Let's hope there is a sequel.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The Time Keeper was amazing as expected. Another one of Mitch's books that makes you stop and question your actions and makes you want to be a better person. This book keeps you wanting more after every chapter. I wish his books were longer, they always end too fast! This book is def. worth reading!!
1451695195|1.0|This seriously deluded account of the visions of an ill man is not in any way proof of \\"heaven\\". It is proof that our brains make pictures that seem real to us. The man was not dead when he saw them - once dead you are always dead. He is not a neuroscientist, he is a neurosurgeon, and like all surgeons, a glorified plumber.<br /><br />Suggest you read Sam Harris on this (a real neurologist) [...] before wasting your money.<br /><br />Edit: (Sadly, I have read the book, although it was skimmed rather quickly. It was given to me as a gift. Someone else's wasted money) The author lays on the 'Argument from Authority' heavily by announcing his credentials and experience and background. Something along the lines of, \\"I am a clever scientist therefore you should believe what I am about to reveal\\". Let us leave the assumption that all surgeons are scientists aside. What destroys his credibility is his uncritical approach to explaining the visions he allegedly saw while unconscious. There is nothing in the scientist here. Someone more cynical than me might even suggest the book was written with a profit motive. If he were a real scientist, and if he had evidence that a \\"heaven\\" were real, all the money he made from the book would be ploughed into this incredible new area of science. A scientist who sincerely believed he had evidence of a previously undescribed \\"heaven\\" would be devoting the rest of his life to gathering further evidence. There would be papers in top scientific journals, Nobel prizes! Science would be furthered and mankind, beleaguered with knowledge of its own mortality, would rejoice.<br /><br />Sadly, I don't see anything approaching this level of sincerity here.
0345803507|5.0|Book received in 2 days just like Amazon promises.  Received in good condition.  Was a gift .  Gift was read and shared with 3 people.  They all said once they started the book they couldn't put it down.  Its a real page turner.
1439102430|2.0|This is not the normal Kathy Reichs book.  This one is boring and I am not even liking the characters that I used to like.  So disappointed.  Will finish it, but it's probably off to Goodwill and not into my permanent collection.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is probably the best I have ever read. I will recommend this book to ALL of my friends.
B008V4H60E|5.0|I played this whole record straight through as soon as I received it. An amazing achievement. In 2008, my girlfriend at the time, with assistance from a mini clip in an adult swim commercial, introduced me to Flying Lotus. In 2010, Cosmogramma found it's way into my bloodstream (see \\"Computer Face//Pure Being\\" to gain a full understanding). This album is exactly what previous reviews have stated; like an endless dream with a few nightmare sequences. When I die, I'd like to think the positive aspect of dying would be playing this album in the background. Euphoric measurements with room for relation to the listener. My favorite band is Radiohead and Thom Yorke on this record is a (+). There's also usage of a Jonny Greenwood guitar composition, previously released because Greenwood and Ellison never got around to collaborating during these recording sessions. In any case, it is evident that Flying Lotus continues to grow as a musician-composer-producer, for the better. **This product works well with Tangerine Kush. Enjoy!

B003ZHR6RK|5.0|Great Movie, much better in BluRay would recommend to others. Keeps you interested from start to finish, great cast of characters.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Honestly, if you havent read this book, then don't bother. I dont know what all the fuss is about.  Is there a story line in there somewhere??  I think not.  Instead, it is ongoing drivel about a sex crazed, rude and egotisical narcissus, who is intent on making a sex slave, for his own depraved sadistic rituals, out of a normal,  if somewhat niave, female 20 something, who apparantely has the IQ of a barstool.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book with all of its twists and turns! It was certainly a good \\"read\\". Assumptions while reading got turned around - upside down. Even the ending was not anticipated!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|worst movie I have ever seen. Highly recommend NOT TO WATCH IT. Tom Cruise was pathetic, the premise was worse.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Okay, I'm a little behind the wave of Batman mania on this one. The third and final movie in the Dark Knight Trilogy was being hailed as the most anticipated movie of the year (yes, moreso than The Avengers), was following up the most successful superhero movie of all-time (yes, not counting The Avengers), and had earned a cult-like movie status after the late Heath Ledger's famous, Oscar-winning performance as the Joker. So much hype. So much too live up too.<br /><br />And, after watching the film for the second time, I can say it does live up to the challenge. The film is a cinematic masterpiece, a genuine action/adventure of the highest caliber. Truly this film secures the Dark Knight Trilogy as one of the greatest series of all-time. So as far as movie review goes, I say 5 out of 5. There's not a dull moment in the story and not a wasted moment of screen time, which is saying a lot as this movie is nearly 2 hours and 45 minutes. Calling it epic would only be cliche and underselling the film. Director Christopher Nolan knew what he was doing here. From the legend and mystery surrounding supervillain Bane to one of the greatest comebacks in hero movies to Jason Gordon-Levitt's outstanding performance, everything is of the highest quality.<br /><br />What interested me the most however, is the social commentary the script writers embedded into this film and really the series as a whole. I always like, and in all honesty, cannot avoid, looking for the hidden worldviews behind the films I watch. After watching The Dark Knight Rises, I can only applaud the filmmakers for their very timely thoughts on Western Civilization, societal decay, and socialism.<br /><br />I will warn that there are possible *spoilers* here if you have not seen the Dark Knight films, so read ahead at your own discretion. The first movie in this trilogy, Batman Begins, introduces audiences to the secret oganization that trained Bruce Wayne, allowing him to become Batman. Its name was the League of Shadows (LoS). We find out during the course of the film that the LoS is responsible for keeping societies in line with a general order and value system. When a society gets too far out of line and deteriorates into chaos and immorality, the LoS would take them down. The demise of the Roman Empire is credited to LoS as an example of their society policing.<br /><br />I find this idea extremely interesting and not unwarranted from a Christian perspective. In the Old Testament days, God would often let the Israelites become overrun when they became too backslidden and wicked. In such cases, God would raise up a foreign power that would dismantle Israelite culture and take the people captive. This served a dual purpose of: (1) bringing the people back to Himself through the repentance that usually comes in divine breaking, as well as (2) stopping the downward spiral into sin. Romans 1 in the New Testament outlines a similar path of societal destruction, where the people fall further and further into mass depravity. The chapter could serve as a template to see how far a society has sunk, and, how much time they have left. I encourage you to read Romans 1 and see if this rings true, see where the U.S. might be in this slippery slope of sin, and how much time might be left on her moral clock.<br /><br />To me, it's profound that Hollywood picked up on this spiritual principle, and though they credit man with monitoring and correcting societies, they nonetheless know that such a thing happens. The third Batman movie, Dark Knight Rises (DKR), comes back to this theme. Capitalizing on the Occupy Wall Street movement and different protests and riots around Europe, DKR shows the \\"common\\" people rising up against the \\"wealthy\\" and \\"wicked\\" ruling class. And in DKR, they achieve success for a time; the fruits of which is also shown. There is a scene where Catwoman and her friend are walking through a rich person's house that has been trashed by the rioting mobs. She picks upa broken picture of the family that used to live there and says something the effect of, \\"This was their home.\\" To which, her friend replies, \\"Now, it's everybody's home.\\" The irony is that the house was now uninhabitable. It had been vandalized and pillaged to the point where no one would want to live there and call it home. Herein is the film's brilliant commentary on socialism.<br /><br />See when something belongs to everybody, it really belongs to nobody. Nobody could live in this home because everyone had ruined it. When everyone owns something (like in socialism), it's hard to establish personal worth in it. You know that no matter how highly you treasure something and work to preserve it, the next person who equally owns the thing, can just destroy it. So a house owned by the \\"people,\\" ends up with no one living in it, not even the family who it rightly belonged to. I say bravo Dark Knight Trilogy for highlighting and speaking to this rising threat to Western Civilization. I say bravo for pointing out how close to the moral edge Western Civ is and how right it would be for it to be taken down.<br /><br />Here in the Dark Knight Trilogy, we have then not just one of the greatest action/adventures series of all-time, but a very real and prophetic insight into the times in which we live. And perhaps therein is its true strength. DKR is relevant. It carries a message. It weighs the world in which it was made and isn't afraid to judge it.<br /><br />One last ideology (which admittedly feels kind of tacked on at this point in the review) that this third film specifically speaks to is that rugged individualism that so saturates the American youth. Today's kids have been taught to express themselves however they see fit; to discover who they are; to follow whatever urge they get; to be as radical as they want and push the envelope as far as they can. Reality TV and the internet have taught the youth that nothing is taboo and everything is within reach. In short, they are fearless. Consequences are an inconsideration. Who can say I'm wrong when everything around me tells me to just be myself? I confess I am tired of ringing the bell of relativism and trying to sound the alarm of postmodernism, but how fitting and inescapable are they when surveying today's social landscape? If I am empowered by culture to do what is right in my own eyes, then I am god; and if I am god, whom then shall I fear?<br /><br />In DKR, Bruce Wayne struggles with fearlessness. After the immense success of the Dent Act (taken place between the second and third films), crime is almost non-existent in Gotham City. Batman, after taking the rap for Harvey Dent's death, is therefore wholly unneeded. Take that into account with the loss of Bruce Wayne's love interest in the second film, and death is no longer a foe or a fear to Batman. With nothing to live for, he welcomes death. As DKR, plays out however, this is shown to be a weakness, not a strength. And it is only when he takes back up the fear of dying, that Batman both begins to live again and becomes effective again in taking on Bane. Hear Batman kids: your fearlessness that you've developed because of your nurtured individualism is not a strength; it's a weakness. The sooner you learn that, the better off you'll be.<br /><br />All things considered, great movie. Great series. Well-deserving of the aforementioned 5 out of 5.a broken picture of the family that used to live there and says something the effect of, \\"This was their home.\\" To which, her friend replies, \\"Now, it's everybody's home.\\" The irony is that the house was now uninhabitable.

B0050SYS5A|4.0|I would have given this five stars except my living room is too small to take full advantage of what this item has to offer.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|The game is fun just wished it gave more coins. I used all the ones from the initial start of the game and have many coins that's about to fall but I have to wait to get more coins. Overall it is a fun game!
B00123B0L2|5.0|While everyone was dressed as Heath Ledger's version of the Joker, I paid homage to Jack Nicholson's version during Halloweens in 2008 and 2009.  I enjoyed the movie and Jack's performance when it premiered in 1989 and its still one of my favorite movies.  I plan on using it again when I don my Joker costume and makeup for Halloween 2013.  Danny Elfman is an under rated composer.
B009VB97EY|4.0|The story could have been more developed and characters more involved, but we all know why we watched it!  the stripping was amazing, and we need at least 3 sequels to this movie!!
B0033B5XCS|5.0|I used these movies to refresh my memory on the character of Freddy Krueger.  It came in handy when I went to a Halloween costume contest in 2011.  I took home first prize for the scariest costume.  I love Mr. Krueger...

B007Z9QWVK|5.0|This is one of the best accounts of Wallace Warfield Simpson, and she is the main character, not just \\"the woman he loved.\\"<br />Casting is brilliant, period well defined.  Madonna deserves an award for this one.
B009FB3XTA|1.0|I received my CD yesterday.  I tried to listen to it.  Not as good as the rest.  My favorite was New Moon and since Bella was now a vamp, I thought it would be faster tempo music.  I love every other CD from twilight.  I feel they were just lazy.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|i like this app as it lets me do most of what i can do on a computer but i only gave 3 stars because when looking thru my news feed it won't let me see everything, unlike the app i have for my mobile phone that shows me several days worth of posts on my newsfeed.<br /><br />other then the newsfeed issue its better then the app on my android phone because it lets me do more. if you could fix the newsfeed problem it would be an awesome app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is so easy to put the cards where they belong.  you can also change the backs to the cards.my back ground to the cards are kats with penceil in it's paws.  so i think that everybody should buy this app.ps it is free
0761171703|5.0|This book is joyful, wonderful, thoughtful, fun, and most of all - gorgeous.  Can't go wrong when you celebrate the everyday! Huge congratulations to Matter, the dancers, and the rest of the team on a brilliant success.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|its nice finally have a real game to play on my tablet,not just a series of puzzels, or the same game with a different backgroud each level.  Deffinatly worth the price.  A full storly line, no &quot;buy as you go&quot; litations, 40+ hours of gameplay.  The controls are really intuitive, easy to just jump right in and fight.  Can flip the screen oncase you wanted to play plugged in.  Graphics are smooth on the fire HD.  Easily the best legal rpg on the market
B0083EW97W|5.0|Own every Mayer album and was to 5 of his concerts the last tour. I love his work. This album really snuck up on me. Read so many reviews that were not favorable that I decided not to buy the CD. Then I heard California Queen on the radio and fell in love with it.<br /><br />Finally decided I need to buy Born and Raised. Only mistake was waiting so long to do it. Incredible collection of music. Much different than the last few albums, but still pure Mayer with little comparison to anyone else out there. He is a true talent, great song writer and superior muscian and vocalist.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this CD. Hard to not listen to it, over and over and over again. Every song is a winner<br />.<br />Dave
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Cheryl Strayed is a very good, easy to read, writer.<br />Her journey on the Pacific Crest Trail echoes the journey that all of us take through life, and to me suggests that if we take ourselves off the beaten path and into alone-ness, our journey can be accomplished much faster. Once we are free of distractions - whether they are people or heroin - we are left with our fears to overcome. And she is one brave and determined woman when alone with hers.<br />She tells the story of walking away her pain, and it's a story that all of us can relate to. Wow!
B00005N6KG|1.0|Maybe its my shape of ears, but these headphones are not comfortable, especially in my right ear. They aren't flexible at all so I guess It's \\"either they fit great or... Not at all\\". Also the cord arrived linked at the plug end and when plugged into my mp3 player, I get some fuzz unless I hold the cord straight. Not impressed. I'll stick to buds I guess.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Has all the right ingredients to grip your interest.Fact mixed with fiction gives a good historical account of WW2 seen from the  whole of Europe from the Spanish civil war to Pearl Harbour.<br />Good second of trilogy await for the third part.<br /><br />Great read by a great author.

B003WUYRGI|1.0|Good!!!!!!  The best book ever I love it so much it is very awesome love it soo cool nice bravo
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gillian Flynn does a good job keeping you guessing.  The book started a bit tedious and the main characters, Amy and Nick were created to be rather shallow.  But once they leave NYC the plot starts to take shape and the reader gets pulled in rather quickly. It evolves into a fun page turner....  however... I won't be a spoiler...  but I HATED the ending.
1451629192|5.0|I got this book for my mother in law after she watched Jaycees story on TV. She really enjoyed it, if you can use the word enjoyed with this story.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I am a true DeMille fan , consider him one of the best contemporary writers. Ever since reading the Charm School, I was hooked on his writing style and I am always  anxiously waiting for the next publication. His wry sense of humor is unparallel( makes me laugh out loud), his plots well thought out, his characters relatable.<br />The only reason I gave a four stars to the Panther is because after the long chase throughout the book the confrontation between to good guy and the bad guy was a over a bit too soon for me. Or it could it been that I did not want the book to end ?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My wife is a school teacher and suggested I try reading the first book of Hunger Games. I hesitated as I always do because she knows I don't read. Like the rest of modern civilization, I stare at a glowing box and become zombie like. I decided after fifteen years of not having read a single page to give Hunger Games a shot. Just a few minutes ago, I read the final lines of the trilogy. This tale swept me from the beginning. I even found myself angry at times, having to remind myself that this was just a story (real or not real...).  Bottom line, this book is worth reading over and over again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I found this free calculator to be very efficient for budgeting. I really like the easy readability of it, and am happy that it shows the math problem entered below the answer for easy clarification.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It's the exact and perfect replacement for the original cable that served us well and endured lots of hard usage. We're confident the new cable will do the same.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|enjoy his style. keeps one intertained to the end. not suprised its fictional places and i dont think the fbi is that stuped to fall for the plot line but its ok, im thinking the ones in prison will enjoy the idea, it will give them hope. fast read keep up the good work.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|John Williams, through film, has made classical music accessible to more people than any other current or previous American composer. I rate John Williams with Aaron Copland, Leonard Bernstein, Howard Hanson, Samuel Barber and those others of greatest America composers. Unfortunately, I fear that the popularity of a score (being both memorable and desirable for repeated listenings) is a strike against truly great American composers, as if the greatest of musicality cannot be appreciated by the unlearned masses but rather only by a select few with special musical knowledge and appreciation. John Williams music is that great reflection of what is substantially unique and great about the American flavor of classical music, evoking landscapes as vast and broad as America and the American imagination. I could scarcely believe there is an American alive today who has watched a film scored by John Williams whose appreciation of both film and music has not increased.<br /><br />John Williams has created a subdued and yet powerful musical landscape for the Steven Spielberg film Lincoln. He has also created I think a soundtrack for the man Abraham Lincoln in the memory of Americans, whether in the pages of Doris Goodwin Kearns \\"A Team of Rivals\\" or Carl Sandburg's Lincoln, the Prairie Years and the War Years. The historical film idiom has made the best use of John Williams musical gifts before in his scores for Schindler's List, Amistad, Angela's Ashes and The Patriot as well as other period film pieces. Throughout Williams new score for Lincoln, we find the wit and humor of Lincoln the president and man, the turbulent times of American Civil War, the shadows of the brutal war to end slavery and the great American question which continues unto this day. Before I was even finished listening there were tracks I wanted to go back to and play again and savor. This is John Williams finest work in years from my perspective, the subject being dear to my heart.<br /><br />BEAUTIFULLYPLAYED, BEAUTIFULLY RECORDED. 5 STARS FOR EVERY TRACK!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is the first time I have streamed anything from Amazon and so far I am really enjoying this option. Season 2 of Downton Abbey will not disappoint if you enjoyed Season 1. Ladies - get out the tissues. You come to really care about all these characters as if they were real.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Excellent, original horror story! One of the best shows I have seen for a long time. Great story lines and suspense. I will never miss an episode.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Alien or aliens were both better, but this one was WAY better then aliens 3 & 4, or any of the AvP movies ever were.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|I wasn't sure I'd like this game, but after i started playing it, i fell in love with it. I would recommend it to everyone.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Bad Piggies is much better than the original Angry Birds. Building and operating contraptions without bounds is much more fun!
B008CG1HZQ|5.0|The cover is hilarious. These guys are so spot on! And the music is awesome - it makes me so happy. I am so glad the band got back together - although I'm sad if this means Justin Hawkins interim band, Hot Leg, is no more. They were even better than the Darkness. Maybe - I dunno. Anything Justin Hawkins is involved with is simply awesome. So glad these guys exist. Can't get enough.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So I used to hate this app and thought it would be stupid. But I wasn't the one playing it. I got this origianally for my brother and I got bored of my other apps. so I gave minecraft a try and it was amazing. its not one of those apps that has an end (besides the end of the world)  its one that you can play for hours straight. it has great graphics and its so awesome on multiplayer. this is a game God for young and old and I recommend it for everyone.  :-)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|my kids like it it is o k just watch what u push ot can get you for some money
B0066WJLU6|5.0|its a good flashlight. it comes on faster than others I've tried. I use it all the time. Really comes in handy when you dont have a real flashlight handy.
B008458O3S|5.0|Great app and I loved playing it until my nexus upgraded to jelly beam now it doesn't work but still a fun app. I'm looking forward to it being compatible to 4.3
B0035LJZ1Q|5.0|WOW! what else can I say? Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. This is a fun movie to watch and, at times, pretty scarey. Johnny Depp is a very skillful actor and he handles his role with professionalism. This movie is under $10.00 and weel worth the price . So, grab you're sweetie, some popcorn and enjoy. Best, John R. Tracy.
1439152780|5.0|I bought this because it was on sale and thought I'd give it a try...and am SO glad I did! This is one of the better books that I've read lately and will definitely be buying more of Kate Morton's books in the future. I either love the stories that go back and forth in time or find them too boring and long-winded to really get into - and this one is absolutely the engrossing kind. Get it, read it...and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did!
B008KL2ITW|5.0|Fantastic book, could not put it down, I was really into Travis and Abby's story from beginning to end. Just wish it could go on and on!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This. seems to be the same Solitaire game that came on our computer so it made it really easy to just start playing it!  A great free game to play in those short times while you're waiting or just passing time.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love this game! Its like I have my own fish. I think you should get this game because it is awesome. I play it 24 -7. The fish are cute &amp; they have awesome decorations &amp; a cool game that you can get lots of money from. I really think you should get this game.
B004JMY312|5.0|This movie is fun for everyone of all ages. I watched it first in my early teens on the Disney channel; came back to watch it again this year as my partner had never seen it! I always crack up, everyone should watch.
B003V9J6R0|5.0|I bought it because I love LP and I love getting stuff on vinyl the tone is more warmer. I would highly recommend you get this on vinyl there is nothing like coming home after a long day of work and dropping the needle on the vinyl. Something about it just takes you away.
B008G59IKO|5.0|Okay I loved &iexcl;Uno! but I had no idea how much better &iexcl;Dos! would be! Don't get me wrong &iexcl;Uno! was great but to me the songs felt a little unnatural! This is something new for Green Day (starting to see a pattern here). I'm glad they went back to their roots previously but \\"Garage Rock\\" was something un-Green Day, if you will and they have absolutely killed it with this record. &iexcl;Dos! to me is a better attempt at something different from 2004 and on Green Day than &iexcl;Uno! was! both are outstanding and not a bad song on either but most fans agree that this is better than the first. However, I've listened to many of the tracks off &iexcl;Tre! and I'm already getting a sense that it will be the best of the three! We'll just have to wait and see!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I've read 'The Hunger Games' trilogy mostly out of curiosity, as it's gotten such rave reviews from friends/family. The first book ('The Hunger Games') was an engaging adventure...basically a gladiator story, taking place years after civil war altered the landscape and society of North America. A teenage girl as the heroine certainly makes this story connect with contemporary society (along with the all too common feature of senseless killing). But that's the only twist that makes this series particularly interesting. Other themes of government control, effects of civil war, haves vs. have nots, etc. are only cursorily developed and are treated far better in other novels. Another flaw is the lack of perspective on how this society relates to the rest of the world. This second book in the series pales by comparison to the first, but now that I'm reading the final book, I see how it fits. Nevertheless, 'Catching Fire' does not stand well on it's own. One needs to read the entire series for this book to satisfy.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|idk yet but it is probs really really really really really awsome i am downlodin now :) :) :) :)
B008D19WBQ|1.0|If you don't want to read to the end, I'll sum it up: you're missing approximately 6 hours of friends footage. PERIOD.<br /><br />While I'd like to believe Warner, I think it's pretty obvious why they released it like this.<br /><br />Let's be honest, they have been airing friends in 720p for a while now, so they already had them remastered and *ready for bluray*, all they had to do was putting them in BR Discs and that was it, the versions they had were the newly-aired  ones, therefore short versions.<br /><br />It is not true that the extended versions were made for the DVDS, it's the opposite, the ORIGINALS are the full episodes we saw on the DVDS.<br />After recording the episodes, producers/ would sit around and cut the bits and pieces that were not necessary/funny/whatever to make it fit in their 30min show timeframe, and then deliver this as the episode to be aired.<br /><br />I was about to purchase this, ASSUMED it was gonna be extended... guess I was wrong. cancelling<br /><br />Update: I just can't let it go, I got home, and just tested the first episode. the birth of friends.<br />DVD: 29:38 minutes<br />BluRay: 23:58<br /><br />Honestly, that's a joke.<br /><br />I did some quick math and having seen the dvds plenty of times I know the eps normally last between 23/25 minutes (or even more sometimes, but i checked a couple and they are between that range) while the tv aired ones (and therefore the bluray ones) only last between 21/23 minutes, lets just round the amount of extra footage per ep to 1.5 minutes, there are 238 episodes, so we're missing, or actually being stolen, 357 minutes (maybe even more), thats 6 hours worth of material, which is actually around 14 \\"episodes\\" of Friends.<br /><br />Really, I just don't get it. Only real explanation would be that the \\"raw copies\\" that they used for the dvds were not really convertible to bluray (which I highly doubt, since they should be the raw original copies), or, that those copies were deleted or whatever, or maybe even some copyrights stuff problem and the only ones that were accessible were the \\"nbc ones\\", and that's why the remastered those.<br /><br />I hope they release the real edition someday in the future, and I'll preorder it even if it costs 1000$.ever, or maybe even some copyrights stuff problem and the only ones that were accessible were the \\"nbc ones\\", and that's why the remastered those.<br /><br />I hope they release the real edition someday in the future, and I'll preorder it even if it costs 1000$.
0525953728|5.0|This was a book I had trepedation about reading because I felt strongly that if only ethically, many of the stories should be left secret to protect the SEALs and their work. Having read the book, I believe the authors handled the topics with great care although I still have mixed feelings. While the stories were inspirational and exciting, there was a part of it that left me suspicious that this was the DoD's way of memorial using their version of the story of Osama's last day. Even if that is true, the greatest outcome could be a greater appreciation for men of war as humans first and the difficulty of moving between the many theaters of their life.
B0076LAF24|1.0|I was really looking forward to this show! I will not watch it again and the only redeeming aspect is it also came with a CD! Obviously a great light show with the music but the film crew always decided to either film too close to see the whole thing, or too far away to see it either! The main focus of the whole DVD was watching the Japanese agape with what we could NOT see!!!! Bad buy!
B009LL4LMM|3.0|Game Play:<br />There are five main chapters to the game and the first one is called Sea Skippin and it is unlocked for the first level. The other four chapters are locked. Sea Skippin has 20 levels in it. The game is a physics based game where jelly wants to collect feathers to learn how to fly. Jelly falls and you draw rubber lines that bounce him properly to collect drops of water and ultimately the feather. The shorter and fewer the lines you draw the more points you get. You only get a limited supply of jelly to make the rubber bands so don't use too much or draw extra lines or make them too long.<br /><br />Jelly can slowly move on the solid objects like he is sliding. He also moves like he knows how to use a trampoline. The game is cute and the graphics are well done in a cartoon style. The game physics are applied well to the game playing actions. Just don't land in the ocean or on the land without beating the game as everything seems to want to eat poor jelly.<br /><br />Main Page:<br />* Credits listed under the information icon<br />* Top hat - a list of the hats that jelly fish has collected<br />* Turn off sound<br />* Turn off vibration<br />* A list of your achievements<br />* Links to Facebook, Twitter, and Concrete software with news messages.<br />* Play<br /><br />What I like:<br />The game action is fun and it plays well on the Kindle Fire. It is challenging and takes strategy to beat each level and it makes you think. I found it to be entertaining to play and it is a good time waster. The game draws lines of the trajectory that you followed and it helps you to properly position your jelly bands and set them to the proper angles to beat the level.<br /><br />The graphics are nicely done and I like the little transition story between the levels.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />I don't care for the links to Facebook, Twitter and Concrete Software with pop up messages that you have been to their site. This game does not need network access to operate and it only uses it to link you to social networks and to their website. I also do not like anything that self-loads on boot. That means that this game is running in the background all the time and using valuable resources on your phone or tablet and can slow down the device's startup and operation. Why does the app have to start at boot up if you are not playing it?<br /><br />Summary:<br />This is a fun game but the two permissions I listed above are unnecessary to play the game. Get rid of the permissions and you have a 5 star game. As it is it is a three star game.<br /><br />Size: The game is 33.9 MB compressed and 37.75 MB uncompressed.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />Storage - modify/delete internal storage contents<br />Network communication - full internet access<br />System tools - prevent Kindle from sleeping<br />Network communication - view network state, view WIFI state<br />Hardware controls - control vibrator<br />System tools - automatically start at bootrate and it only uses it to link you to social networks and to their website.

B00845MRKE|5.0|Watching \\"Blade Runner\\" is an emotional investment no matter how many times you see it. I don't know if it's the lighting, the music, the dialogue, or a combination of all of the above. How a science fiction film from 1982 can still have that effect on me after seeing it dozens of times is beyond my comprehension. I always come away from the film with my insides all mixed together with sadness, excitement, and that warm feeling of happy nostalgia you get when you experience something you never thought you could again.<br /><br />Thanks to Warner Bros. Home Entertainment's release of \\"Blade Runner: The 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition,\\" science fiction fans can view any one of five different versions of the film whenever they want in the comfort of their own home theater. You can choose from \\"The Final Cut,\\" the \\"Original Theatrical Cut,\\" the \\"International Theatrical Cut,\\" the \\"Director's Cut,\\" or the \\"Rare Workprint Feature Version.\\"<br /><br />No matter what version of the movie you watch, they all tell the same story. In the year 2019, a group of organic robots called replicants kill a ship full of people while escaping an interstellar trip and head to Earth. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is hired to hunt the fugitives down and destroy them. Deckard is what is referred to as a \\"blade runner\\" - a special police officer that \\"retires\\" replicants when they wander back to Earth where they've been banned.<br /><br />I've seen \\"Blade Runner\\" in many different environments and formats. I've seen it on VHS on a 25-inch television. I had the opportunity to see it on the big-screen a couple of times at revival screenings. I've watched it on a 50-inch flat screen in a regular DVD format. I can wholeheartedly tell you that if you haven't seen this amazing piece of cinema history on Blu-ray in its restored \\"Final Cut\\" version then you've never properly viewed it.<br /><br />Each version of the film has something different to add to its viewing experience. There are different endings, additional footage, and even a monologue by Harrison Ford that tells you everything you need to know (and many fans would say some things you shouldn't) to help explain what's happening throughout. I suggest watching every version of the film to truly appreciate and take it all in.<br /><br />Douglas Trumball's special visual effects are a step beyond stunning. The use of models and practical effects gives \\"Blade Runner\\" a realistic look that filmmakers today using CGI only wish they could achieve. Everything from the architecture of the buildings to the designs of the vehicles still influences designers to this day.<br /><br />\\"The Final Cut\\" is breathtaking to look at in high-definition. I've never seen the movie look so pure. Yet somehow it still has that nostalgic grainy element that only real film can provide. The last time I remember feeling this satisfied with a high-definition transfer was when I saw the Blu-ray version of \\"Jaws\\" for the first time. The 5.1 surround sound mix gives viewers everything they could ever want by immersing them in an excellent musical score by Vangelis mixed with sonic treats like the blips and beeps of communicators, the engines of hover crafts and cars, and the chaotic noises of the futuristic city.<br /><br />Special features included in this edition include the 211-minute \\"Dangerous Days\\" documentary, \\"All Our Variant Futures: From Workprint to Final Cuts\\" documentary, HD stills, and more than 1,000 archival images. There are also introductions to the different versions by director Ridley Scott and audio commentary by various people. Let's just say there's enough material to easily pack four discs.<br /><br />We also get an exclusive hardcover art book full of behind-the scenes photos, production art, sketches, and storyboards. Let's not forget the lenticular mini-poster and Concept Spinner model included in the box set. \\"Blade Runner: The 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition\\" truly is the gift that keeps on giving.<br /><br />There's no possibly way any hardcore devotee of \\"Blade Runner\\" could be disappointed in this new edition of the cult film. It's an exhaustive collection of every version of the movie combined with hours of behind-the-scenes and making of features to give special insight into the construction of this cinematic treasure. It's an absolute must-have item to complete any science fiction buff's library of essential movies..<br /><br />There's no possibly way any hardcore devotee of \\"Blade Runner\\" could be disappointed in this new edition of the cult film.

B009KYXEY6|5.0|I admit that I am a little late to the Lana Del Rey party but I'm glad to have witnessed her daring and emotionally provoking video for the \\"Ride\\" track. Many of the songs from Lana Del Rey evoke a 60's pop vibe with a modern-day twist.  The best way to describe Paradise is a strong musical effort that is unique in a similar way of the \\"Boots\\" song by Nancy Sinatra.  My favorite songs from Disc 1 are \\"Blue Jeans\\", \\"Video Games\\", \\"Dark Paradise\\", \\"Radio\\", \\"Million Dollar Man\\", and \\"Lucky Ones.\\"  \\"Ride\\", \\"American\\", \\"Blue Velvet\\", and \\"Gods & Monsters\\" and \\"Bel Air\\" are my favorites from disc 2.  \\"Born To Die-The Paradise Edition\\" by Lana Del Rey is best for those who enjoy vintage pop music.
B005LAII08|4.0|As I begin this review, I should confess I'm not a big Pixar fan. Although I do recognize the charm the films hold, I don't find them as entertaining as most people do. Much of that has to do with the animation style. The environments look great, but I find the human beings to resemble lifeless marionettes many times. The atmospheres of the movies are too \\"cute\\" for me as well. I'm not big on \\"cute\\" when it comes to animated movies.<br /><br />All that being said, Disney and Pixar's \\"Brave\\" is as good as their films come. It has all the right elements of a classic fairy tale with a few twists thrown in to keep things modernized. There's a princess, a witch, and some kooky animals in a faraway land.<br /><br />The only thing missing is a prince to save the day. Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) makes it very clear to her parents that she doesn't need a prince to fulfill her life's ambitions or save her. She wants to live life on her own terms free of the trappings and responsibilities of being royalty.<br /><br />Merida stumbles upon a witch (Julie Walters) that gives her a spell to change the Queen's (Emma Thompson) mind about marrying one of three suitors from other clans. The spell does more than change her mother's mind; it physically transforms her into the most feared creature in the kingdom - a gargantuan bear. Merida frantically looks for a way to change the Queen back before her father (Billy Connolly) and fellow huntsmen track her down. They mistakenly believe her to be the bear that took the King's leg.<br /><br />In usual fashion, there are lessons for everyone to learn in \\"Brave.\\" One is children should be careful what they wish for and value their parents. The other is that parents should give children the freedom to choose their own paths in life. It wouldn't be a Disney or Pixar movie without some sort of words of wisdom.<br /><br />\\"Brave\\" is successful as a whole. I'm glad I gave it a chance after skipping it in theaters. The initial marketing campaign for the movie offered no real motivation for me to see it in theaters. I did get a bit frustrated during the climax with some of Merida's illogical decisions. The different settings in the film really do carry you away to a fantasy world and help put you into the middle of the story and action.<br /><br />The movie looks and sounds phenomenal in its high-definition version. Merida's bright red hair magically stands out against the backdrops of dark green meadows and grey castle walls. All the sounds of waterfalls and roaring bears mixed with cultural musical numbers spring to life through an elegant 7.1 surround mix.<br /><br />There's plenty of special bonus material to give consumers their money's worth. Director Mark Andrews, co-director Steve Purcell, story supervisor Brian Larsen, and Editor Nick Smith all provide commentary for the film. It also includes two shorts entitled \\"The Legend of Mordu\\" and \\"La Luna.\\" \\"The Legend of Mordu\\" features the witch from \\"Brave\\" telling the story of the Demon Bear. We get eight \\"behind-the-scenes\\" featurettes, four extended scenes, an alternate opening, several art galleries, and plenty more.<br /><br />Disney / Pixar's 5-Disc Combo Pack of \\"Brave\\" has everything admirers of the movie could want. You can choose whether you want to watch it in 3D or 2D. The different formats make it easy to view anywhere on any sort of device. If you're curious how the movie was created there's plenty of \\"making of\\" and \\"behind-the-scenes\\" material to educate you. This is the perfect addition to any family's home entertainment library.ign for the movie offered no real motivation for me to see it in theaters.

B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Christina Aguilera's interview with Lucky magazine was what first got me interested in checking out her recent work. My curiosity was also heightened when she mentioned that anyone that likes the song \\"Fighter\\" is also going to like her new work and when Blake Shelton publicly endorsed her latest cd (via facebook).  I consider both Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert naturally good singers. Naturally,I figured that \\"Lotus\\" must contain good vocals as well.  I am glad that I went by this hunch because Christina Aguilera's voice definitely shines through on this deluxe version.  I understand that others may prefer different songs, but these tracks are currently among some of my favorites on \\"Lotus\\": \\"Army Of Me\\", \\"Red Hot Kinda Love\\" \\"Make The World Move\\" (featuring Ceelo), \\"Your Body\\", \\"Let There Be Love\\", \\"Around The World\\", \\"Best Of Me\\", \\"Just A Fool\\" (featuring Blake Shelton), and \\"Light Up The Sky\\".<br />\\"Lotus\\" by Christina Aguilera is definitely recommended for those who enjoy \\"Fighter\\" and/or at least three songs by Christina Aguilera.

B0069UV0LS|5.0|I've been a fan of Paddy Considine ever since I saw him in director Shane Meadow's amazing first film, [[ASIN:B000056IFL A Room for Romeo Brass]], in which he played a creepy, insecure bully with considerable skill. He went on to star in more of Meadow's films, notably [[ASIN:B001BLFMVE Dead Man's Shoes]], in each showing himself to be an actor of great ability. With this film, Considine proves that he isn't just a one trick pony: he can direct as well as act. As far as I understand it, he wanted to make this film for some time, but had great trouble raising the necessary funds. It's a credit to him that he managed it, and then made such an accomplished piece of work. Few films nowadays dwell within scenes, or on actors' faces, thereby deepening the viewer's experience. They're far too busy whipping on to the next scene. This is not Considine's way.<br /><br />The film is mainly the story of two people, an angry, ill-mouthed alcoholic, and a long-suffering religious woman who is fearfully abused by her husband. An uncompromising story arc follows. What I found most powerful was the way that Considine allowed the camera to linger on the actors' faces, expressions and acts, refraining from using music to fill the air, as it were. Consequently, the towering performances are augmented, the suffering magnified, the horror driven home even further.<br /><br />This is a work of great skill, with a fine set of actors. It's so well shot, full of atmosphere, and all the more terrible for that. Thankfully, it's not 100% bleak. That would have been hard to take. Absolutely outstanding. I look forward to Considine's next film with great anticipation. 5 solid gold stars out of 5.<br /><br />Ben Kane, author of Spartacus: the Gladiator.
B000KLRUKC|5.0|In a recent review of the first Tebaldi recording, with Del Monaco in 1952, I suggested that the best Aida might be the 1962 Solti/Price/Vickers one, without having made a direct comparison between it and Tebaldi's second Aida, this 1959 Decca recording.  Well, I made the comparison, and I have to admit that I prefer the 1959 Karajan/Tebaldi.  On the minus side, I still find the stereo soundstage effects by Karajan and/or the producer John Culshaw a distraction at times -- they bother me especially in the final scene -- but these are outweighed by other sterling features of the recording.  The voices are not quite as in-your-face as in the Solti recording, where there is a tendency to overload and distort a bit on my equipment, and while Price and Vickers have wonderful voices for their respective roles, this 1959 Decca recording puts Tebaldi, Bergonzi, et. al. in a more flattering aural space.  I think it counts too that Tebaldi and Bergonzi are native Italians -- in the Nile Scene (Act 3), Tebaldi manages the tricky verbal phrasing (the fitting of the words to the vocal line) of \\"O Patria Mia\\" more comfortably than Price, and her command of the music is just as confident and expressive as Price's.  In the Nile Scene too, it's impossible to overpraise Bergonzi's singing -- his voice is a bit less hefty than Vickers's and Del Monaco's (and even Domingo's [1974, Muti, EMI]), but he sings with such precise focus that the music is perhaps better served, and he lacks nothing in commitment to the role.  Radames was a role that he sang often and effectively on stage.  Simionato is a very fine Amneris (as is Gorr for Solti), and McNeill, like Bergonzi, sings with focused sound, whereas Merrill (for Solti) tends to spread a bit.  Karajan's conducting is refined when appropriate but with plenty of oomph for the big scenes -- a distinguished reading all round. (I'm reminded that in the seven years between Tebaldi's two assumptions of the the role of Aida, Decca worked on their engineering and began to produce their stereo Solti-led \\"Ring\\" cycle, still quite impressive sonically).<br /><br />Back to Aida: Listening again to Muti with Caballe and Domingo, I find good sound and good singing, but Caballe's voice, for all its beauty and sensitive deployment, doesn't fill out the role like a real spinto of the Tebaldi or Price kind.  Domingo is fine -- a lovely \\"Celeste Aida\\" --  but I think Muti rushes at places (the tomb scene needs more room to breathe).  Later still, Karajan had a second go at Aida, with Carreras and Freni, but both are too light of voice to be ideal; and Abbado had a go with Domingo and Ricciarelli -- the latter not happily cast.  So I'm sticking with the 1959 Karajan, but I'll also be hanging on to the Muti and Solti and Erede recordings.  They all bring good things to the table (as does the old 1955 Bjoerling/Milanov), but for overall effect, I'll go with Karajan, Tebaldi, and Bergonzi.r engineering and began to produce their stereo Solti-led \\"Ring\\" cycle, still quite impressive sonically).<br /><br />Back to Aida: Listening again to Muti with Caballe and Domingo, I find good sound and good singing, but Caballe's voice, for all its beauty and sensitive deployment, doesn't fill out the role like a real spinto of the Tebaldi or Price kind.

These are as easy to play with as regular playing cards. But if you like Burton, you'll enjoy the sketches - just a little extra fun while playing card games.

B0091Q82L8|5.0|Ok i have to start out by saying that to me i think the deluxe version of The Who Live At Leeds is the greatest live album ever to be recorded my man. Now after having said that this is great as well. Both on Live At Leeds & The Hull Pete Townshends guitar sound & mix is just amazing. It's really hard to fathom. I meen to have both albums have such a clean & clear sound & just for the fact that these 2 shows were recorded in 1970 just blows my mind & not just because it was recorded over 42 years ago but it's the fact that none of the other live albums by other band's recorded around that time period even remasterd sound half as good. Live At Leeds had no recording issue's so yes there are just a few little clicks of the drum sticks that hit the mic & Johns bass did not record well on the first few tracks so it was replaced with the bass lines from the Live At Leeds show to make it all fit & complete. Just remember that Pete Townshend had a major mad fit because of the recording issues & because they intended that the live album was supposed to be Live At The Hull basied on the better sounding venue & they liked the performance better as well. All i can say is i enjoyed both the Leeds show & Hull  If you don't already own the deluxe version of Live At Leeds & just have the single disc version this is a great way to go. Or if your like me & you own the Leeds Deluxe version & loved that then you will enjoy this as well because there are not many full live recordings of Keith Moon on the drums from that period so i am more then thrilled to now own The Great Lost Hull Show!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is a great movie! I rewatched both Iron Man movies, Thor, both Hulk movies, and Captain America. before I saw this movie at the theater. I went to see it twice. Now that I have the DVD, I can keep watching it multiple times. Awesome action, great storyline and directing. After all the hype before it came out, this is one of the few that fulfilled the sense of anticipation I had. It belongs in everyone's collection!
B009DJB9HC|5.0|I have been a fan of this band ever since the first album came out. And with this now being there 3rd album i'm still a fan. I really think this is the best one out of the 3 albums. Right off the bat deep heavy grooves that have alot of shades of deep purple in it but then off to very melodic chorus's. Glen Hughes has to be the greatest 61 year old singer ever. I meen this guy's voice is better then most 20 year old singers. He has a very youthful sounding voice & can scream with the best of them. The whole album i just keep saying to my self. HOW DOES HE DO IT? The album opens big and strong with Big Train, But then keeps on rolling with This Is Your Time that is another very stong melody & melodic corus. Confessor Standed out right away to me & has become my favorite track off the album it's just a big heavy jam. Cry For Freedom is a great duet balance between Joe Bonnamassa & Glen Hughes. They just seem to sing together unforcefuly like it was just ment to be. Joe Bonamassa well not much to say since he does a great job on everything it seem's and he stands on his own as always. Jason Bonham has to be so proud. The guy has been on a major roll as far as his accomplishments with Led Zeppelin & has really proved his playing ability's on these 3 albums. But out of the 3 albums i think this is Jason Bonhams best showing of how well of a drummer he is.  Derek Sherinian really takes it old school rock pounding away on his hammond organ in way's that would make Jon Lord proud. In the words of Pete Townshend Rock Is Definitely Saved, LONG LIVE ROCK!
B009LA1QW6|3.0|These all just sound like tracks that did not make the first album and with good reason they are just okay, nothing special.

B000JZ68GG|4.0|This is one of the most unusual and interesting movies I've ever seen. It was a little racy for the time. This movie is what put Jane Fonda on the map to the dismay of vietnam veterans a few years later. If you liked the Flash Gordon movie, the one with Sam Jones you will probably like this movie, heck if you didn't like it you will probably still like this movie.

B009B4ZEKM|2.0|I've been a fan of Christina for a while, and I loved Stripped and Back to Basics.<br /><br />But this effort was disappointing to listen to. Many songs are unpleasant to listen to due to her shouting of every line. There are strange decisions, including an over-use of Auto-tune and songs that sound like rejected demos for Katy Perry or Rihanna.<br /><br />Disappointing.
B0053KWDES|5.0|This head phone amp is really cool!  I never new amps were made for headphones until recently.  I've always used ear buds (apple iPod buds)  which have always been just right for me, no amp needed. I switched over to the full size headphones  &#34;on ear/over ear&#34; type to get better sound and enjoy my music more then I could from my buds.<br /><br />The larger type headphones sound much better then my already favorite ear buds so I was very happy but then I came across something that would take me to another level. The headphone amp. Yes it makes the music louder but that's not why you have it. It's for the clarity and the extra punch that it supply's to your music, good headphones required of course.<br /><br />The Fiio E11 is a very well made and solid little amp that seems like it will last for a long time, with proper care. The price is very affordable and would be a good amp to start out with for the first time amp user. I will never again use headphones with no amp. There are much better made quality amps but you will pay a arm and leg for them and should have very good quality set of cans to get the most from the amp.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this amp.

It teaches how to measure warp and how to use a warping board.  The author's suggestion for a \\"sampler\\" piece crafted in two contrasting colors was excellent.  I hadn't warped a loom in years so it was a great overview.  My husband is a complete beginner to weaving and it helped him through his first project.  Well worth the money.

B004G6009U|5.0|My four year old loves this movie.  It has helped me to help her understand 'stranger danger' in a way.  Some parents may believe this film is too intense for their child, but not all Disney princess movies can/have to be made for younger (ages 2-5 or so) viewers.  If you think your child is too young for this film, then just wait a few years - she'll love it then.  My four year old is very bright for her age and she understood the 'good points' of the movie.  This is a great family film in our house as my husband likes it too.  The horse is his favorite  =)

B008CPZNL6|5.0|I've been using this app on my ipad for awhile now but just got a Kindle Fire HD and instantly loaded it on to that. Hands down, it's the app I use the most.  The kindle version is slightly different than the ipad version that takes a little getting used to (I think it works like the iphone app). I guess the smaller screen forces it to behave slightly differently. On my ipad, I can see multiple headlines and blurbs on one page whereas on the kindle, I only see one article at one time.<br /><br />I know there are other apps like this but I compared this and Pulse awhile back and happened to like Flipboard much better.
B0050C863G|5.0|Use this book together with the Headspace application and you will see that it is feasible to incorporate meditation in your routine. Highly recommend this book and related tools, the Author and his company had really found an effective way to use reference materials, the web and mobile applications to create useful solutions for our chaotic &#34;ways of living&#34;. The book is pleasant and easy to follow, based on research and full of stories and real examples. The app enables the practice, the book clarifies the approach and invites you to integrate meditation without treating it as hippie subject or rocket science at all.
B009NOVCTM|4.0|I love the Stones, and there is no denying the greatness of the tracks here.  But does the world really need this after Forty Licks, Jump Back, Hot Rocks and More Hot Rocks, and Rewind, not to mention the original albums/CDs?  I already have every song on here (I haven't parsed the full listing of the 5-disc set).  I wish there was a whole new CD from the group.  It would be nice if the new tracks were released on a CD single instead of tempting the die-hard fan to re-purchase music they/we already have.  And how tacky is that cover art?
B009VB7QQA|5.0|1 of the best movies that I have seen in a while.... And wish it was more movies like this one ...

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Could not stop reading, could not guess what was going to happen next.  I loved the ending but not sure who the good guys are.  I do believe our government law enforcement is every bit as corrupt as this story portrayed, at lest some of our law enforcement is this bad or worse.  A mater storyteller at his best. I love fiction like this

0307361012|3.0|Norwegian author Jo Nesbo's seven thrillers available in English are the third through ninth of the Harry Hole series, beginning with The Redbreast, published in the US in 2006, and continuing through Phantom, published in the US in October, 2012. The Bat, Nesbo's first Harry Hole novel, now translated and available in the UK and Canada, was originally published in Norway in 1997, and it is intriguing for many reasons, not least for the growth it shows in Nesbo's narrative and stylistic talents.<br /><br />Here Norwegian author Jo Nesbo first introduces Harry Hole, an unconventional, very young detective.  Harry has been sent to Australia to help investigate the murder of Ingrid Holter, a young, blonde Norwegian woman with an Australian work permit.  Harry's first discovery is that no one there can pronounce his name correctly, always calling him \\"Hole,\\" as in \\"mole.\\" Ironically, he starts referring to himself as \\"Holy,\\" much closer to the correct pronunciation, though not to his character, and the spelling continues in the narrative. His second discovery is that he will be working with a powerfully built former boxing champion, an Aborigine on the force whom Harry finds intriguing, both personally and culturally.<br /><br />Ingrid Holter, the victim, was working at a local bar when she was killed. An attractive blonde, she had been fending off advances from her strange bartender; avoiding her even stranger landlord and his vicious \\"Tasmanian Devil\\" of a dog; and spending her nights with a man known to have many connections to the drug world. As the police investigate, it becomes clear that they may be looking for a serial killer obsessed with blonde women. A check of past murders shows four women who have been strangled with the killer's bare hands, leaving no clues.  As he helps investigate, Harry also falls in love, gets physically attacked, sometimes viciously, and fights his battle with the bottle, once again.<br /><br />Episodes from Harry's teen years include some stories about his sister, about his yearning to be punished for a death he caused as a youth but which others covered up, and about his family. These homey details stand in stark contrast to the life of Andrew Kensington, the Aborigine officer with whom he is working. Part of the Stolen Generation of Aborigine youth, who were removed from their parents and educated by outsiders, Andrew has been doubly hurt, denied a family and denied a culture. Nesbo reveals much about Aborigine culture here, their myths and legends, beliefs, and value system, and while it is clear that the author is fascinated with this culture, these digressions, unfortunately, do not advance the action and feel added on to the story.<br /><br />The novel occasionally resembles a travelogue, with each trip to a new part of Sydney or outside it described in vivid detail, though Nesbo does provide enough blood and thunder to keep readers reading, even as they may wonder where the sometimes rambling plot is going. The characters often \\"converse\\" in long paragraphs, instead of conveying information through the give and take of normal conversation, making the dialogue feel unrealistic in places.  For those familiar with the series, this one is worth reading, but if you have not yet discovered Jo Nesbo, my suggestion is to start with The Redbreast, probably Nesbo's most interesting and challenging thriller, and go forward from there. The Redbreast is set in Norway, the country Nesbo knows most intimately.some stories about his sister, about his yearning to be punished for a death he caused as a youth but which others covered up, and about his family.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|I thought that ITUNES killed the album concept. Luckily for all of us,Sunken Condos refutes that contention. This album blends seamlessly with Fagen's classic The Nightfly. Great tracks include: \\"Weather in my Head\\" \\"Memorabilia\\" and \\"Planet D'Rhonda.\\" Those are some of my highlights,but if you know the Dan/Fagen thing,there are no weak tracks here. Beautifully crafted music to take you back to the '80s!
030758836X|1.0|This was a most depressing book, especially the end.  None of the characters are likeable.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
0525953728|5.0|I enjoyed this book for it's facts and for the style in which it was written.  Very entertaining and interesting and worth the money.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham is an awesome writer who is able to pull th e reader deep into his story. While there is some of that here, at about midway through the book, the puzzle seemed to unravel and the plot was inadvertently revealed. Still an excellent and fun read - just not quite as climactic as some of his other legal thrillers.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie! it was pretty well done. Lots of HOT men! I wish Joe M would have been shown more in the movie, that's the only thing worth changing. I'm very glad I bought it!
0545425115|4.0|I wasn't really connected to the Hunger Games book series untill I watched the first movie and after that I started to read the book series. Once I got started reading this book it got my attraction about every page and chapter I read. The readers can quickly get stuck to this book because it's so good. The only negative part I have with this book is reading about kids killing each other and make it depressing at times, however the more I read this book the more I can't put it down.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very good, but not the best of the trilogy. Still exciting and page turning. For a set of books that I never thought I would read or be interested in, this was a very good finale.
B0098R6M1M|2.0|Thought this was going to be a comedy and it is not.  While it had some thought provoking moments, I would not recommend this movie.
6305127638|5.0|Star Trek: First Contact became my favorite Trek film upon its initial theatrical release, and I think it's unlikely to surrender that status anytime soon, especially given the manner in which the entire franchise was rebooted in 2009. Everything comes together here in a perfect cinematic storm: Picard as Ahab pursuing the great white whale that is the Borg, Picard's relationship with Data, the trip back to the beginnings of the Trek universe and the accomplishment of Zefram Cochrane -- plus the classic acting skills of Patrick Stewart and direction of Jonathan Frakes, serving in that capacity for the first time. And, of course, Jerry Goldsmith's elegiac score. Touching on prime elements of the Trek mythology, demonstrating not only craft but art as well, this film holds up remarkably well after more than 15 years, seeming as fresh and engaging as when it first lit up the big screen. As always in any series or franchise, everyone has their favorite, and as I said, this is mine. Subjectivity plays a large role, of course, but I believe that even from an objective standpoint this remains the apex of the Star Trek experience.
0439023513|5.0|After seeing the movie, I purchased the books to see how the story evolves.  Enjoyed the books very much and they are a fast read...hard to put down.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|I have to agree with those who have argued that this reboot of the Star Trek franchise essentially creates something different disguised as Star Trek. Star Trek was as much about ideas as action, even though those ideas were often naive and half-baked. Oh, and also about human relationships, even when some of those humans actually weren't. The reboot is pure action. Period. Well done action, I will grant, though sometimes -- if you'll pardon use of the phrase -- quite illogical. Moreover, the human relationships this time around seem rather perfunctory and superficial, but perhaps they haven't had the time to be developed -- after all, the original Star Trek characters had decades together on the small and big screen. The manner of the franchise's makeover is clever if not completely original -- as readers of, say, DC comics will testify. And perhaps I should leave with that reference in mind. Iconic characters are always being redefined and reworked. The Superman of today is not the Superman of the early 1960 or the original of the late 1930s. Sherlock Holmes has come in gone in several incarnations other than the Arthur Conan Doyle stories that created him. This version of Star Trek is like the original only in superficial resemblance, and it's not what I think of when I think of Star Trek. But I won't begrudge the early 21st Century its own vision of the 23rd which is different than what I experienced in the 20th. This vision is well crafted on the outside, but just okay at its spiritual core, which nonetheless is perhaps in tune with the times.

B008PNBU30|4.0|I must say that I was very disappointed with their last album \\"Life Starts Now\\" so I wasn't expecting much from this album, but I actually like it. Yes, it is quite different from what they sounded like on their first two albums, but there are still some heavy ballads that you can rock to.<br /><br />I judge an album my the percentage of songs on it that I enjoy listening to. If it's over 70% then I said it's a good album. So I would say this is a little better then a \\"good\\" album b/c I enjoy listening to every song. Usually on an album there's at least a few songs I can't stand. That's not the case with this album.<br /><br />An overall improvement, in my opinion, from their last record.<br /><br />There's a lot of garbage out there in the hard rock arena, a general lack of new talented bands, so why not spend your money on a veteran like these guys.
B002NF1ZI6|3.0|Legos are wonderful for kids of all ages. And you can never have too many doors and windows, wheels, etc. But this product is far better priced with Toys R Us. For the exact same product, the price is 25-50% less with them. I'd shop around before purchasing.

B004CR5TD0|5.0|Living in a time where the music consumer can comfortably access and listen to any artist he or she chooses, past or present, I think there's an onus like no other on this generation of new artists to produce music that's truly distinctive. Whether James Blake conciously understands this or not is debatable, however the uniqueness of his self titled debut is certainly not up for questioning. The computerized experimentalism of Blake's highly acclaimed slew of 2010 ep's, already saw him crafting a unique lane for himself yet he upped the anti on this eponymous release by moving away from the laptop somewhat, to present his elegiac choir-esque singing voice as the main selling point here. Not since Kid A has an artist been able to match emotive balladeering and forward thinking electronica as successsfully as James Blake does here, his songs each one brilliant in their own right, are equal parts challenging and emotionally provocative.<br /><br />The soulful sound of Blakes ineffable vocals were heard permeating over spartan piano chords and glacial snare snaps when his version of Feist's \\"Limit To Your Love\\" dropped before the release of this album and I (perhaps like many) thought that the excellence of that track would dwarf any songs that sat beside it on a full length LP. \\"Unluck\\" quickly sweeps away any pessismistic doubts you may of had, with it's enchanting array of quicksilver clicks, mmanipulated synths and multi layered vocals coming together to mesmerizing effect. Although James Blake uses vocoder and autotune in this opener, the humanity in \\"Unluck\\" somehow remains completely intact, it's as though JB has unlocked the dormant power lieing in machines to enhance our voice's ability to convey sadness and despondancy.<br /><br />\\"The Wihelm Scream\\" is the real jewel in the crown here though, it starts off sparsely with muted synths, lonely snare hits and touches of watery music concrete beofre transforming into a blaze of cathartic post-dubstep with the simple lines \\"I don't know about my love, all that I know is i'm falling falling falling, might as well fall in\\" looped throughout the songs duration adding an extra level of pathos. \\"Lindasfarne I\\" is another snapshot of pure beauty, with James blake's vocodered upper register vocals reminscent of Bon Iver on \\"Woods\\", Blake doesn't aim for heavenly transcendence like that track though, he put's much more of a focus on delicacy and ambience to achieve a strong sense of intimacy and calmness.<br /><br />Although the back half of this album isn't filled with as many obvious highlights, blakes crooning is largely front and centre from \\"Give me my Month\\" onwards and it's a delight to hear his untreated voice and his minimal piano playing without as many embellishments as he really plays and sings so well. Some have taken issue with James Blakes mantra of less is more here and even though i'm patently a huge fan of this record I could understand why adrenalin junkies would consider this LP a remedy for insomnia. Nevertheless; Fans of Steve Reich, sufjan Stevens or The XX will doubtlessly be \\"as in love with this as I am\\" and should most definitely check this out if they happened to miss it upon it's release almost two years ago.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was good, but Greg made me  mad because he way over reacted. He should of kept dancing because he doesn't get many opportunities like that a lot.
B008BIN9EW|1.0|So apparently the guy who wrote this game has a serious case of sour grapes. Amazon made it the Free app of the day, and he changed the settings on it in the app store so it's not compatible with anything. My take - it's a great game, but don't buy it.

B009KYXEY6|4.0|The Paradise Edition is absolutely amazing! I'm in love with the 8 new tracks. Unfortunately, there's an error with the \\"Born to Die\\" CD: Instead of there being 15 tracks, there are only 12, leaving out \\"Without You\\", \\"Lolita\\", and \\"Lucky One\\". Hopefully, there's a recall for the product and we can receive a replacement! I am looking forward to listening to the others!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|But the movie was entertaining, too! My husband didn't read the books but really enjoyed the movie - so much so that he keeps asking when the next one is coming out.
B008Y1YJZY|3.0|first im going to complain about the 3d version. when you put the disc in it will ask if you want to convert from 2d to 3d yes, do you have on you 3d glasses yes. after the 3 previews it will ask again, than it will show alittle thing about 3d, than it will ask again, than it will go to menu push play than it will ask again. that is 6 times it will ask me if i want to switch to 3d and ask me if i have my 3d glasses on before the movie plays. this is the first 3d movie im ask 6 times. i think somebody goofed putting the 3d movie together. the 3d movie itself was top notch. no pop outs but good depth. the movie was boreing in some spots. so i graded it average. but i always believe the 3d brings the movie back alive.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|How can you care about characters that bore their very author?<br /><br />The story, as it goes, comes around enough to tie up the loose ends so that you don't feel that this was a poorly designed novel.  But that is about the best thing I can say about John Grisham's new book, The Racketeer.<br /><br />The book is not badly written, Grisham too good for that, but it is written without enthusiasm. Everything seems to be told on a sedated even keel without passion and without any excitement whatsoever. There are no highs and lows. The passion is totally passionless. The horror - after all, two people are murdered and a woman is tortured viciously (or so we hear)is  sterile and evokes exactly zero emotion or outrage of any sort.  There is no tension anywhere.  And above all, there is no vivid sense of danger or that anything is truly at stake - and that condemns any art to mediocre, elevator-music level of entertainment.<br /><br />Alas, I spent the full price for it.  I'd say anything above $3.99 for the ebook version is too much.<br /><br />Better yet, wait for the movie.  It's bound to be better.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Absolutely a FANTASTIC little Movie !!!!!! A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!! My little girl loved it by far one of the better tink movies.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|It's a nice, well made game. And it's fun. I'm not sure about paying 3$ for it though. I got it as free app of the day but I would see it as a 99cents game. That is a more reasonable price.
B009YU62H2|5.0|I can't believe how good this album is.  It took a couple listens through to \\"get\\" a lot of the songs, because that is what Soundgarden does best - be different.  Spectacular album.

B001KQZ7I8|3.0|This book would be interesting for someone who is really into the psychology of going through trauma. It really analyses what people go through in their minds during trauma, especially during the Holocaust and concentration camps. It was interesting at times, but for me it was also very slow. It took me awhile to finish it, sometimes because it gave me a lot to think about and other times because it didn't quite hold my interest. It inspired me in many ways because it focused on how you can have an optimistic attitude during really tough times and that this attitude can help you find good in every situation. It is definitely deep and I am glad I read it, but not one of my favorites.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I like DeMille's style of writing and the humor he introducea through his characters. This story flows well and is an interesting read.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I got this book because I just needed reading material for a plane ride. I wasn't planning on getting hooked but I did!  I hurried and read the first and immediately bought the second. This is definitely a book worth reading.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I wasn't as skeptical as most people before this was released and it took just 1 or 2 listens to get hooked, but God, i don't know what to say. It's like a dream come true to have it this good again. I love every track on this album. Been Away Too Long is an excellent opener and you instantly recall some fine moments from Down On the Upside throughout - I never cease to be amazed at what these guys do in less than 5 minutes- There are some killer riffs that follow in Non-State Actor, By Crooked Steps absolutely kills, and one thing I like is how each of those 1st three songs end; everything is thrown in, the Axes, sledge hammers and nails and it's all bottomed out with Shepherd's booming bass. After three great climaxes, I am stunned by a Thousand Days Before. I really think if there is a song that sounds fresh but offers us a glimpse of vintage Soundgarden at their best this is it and it is now one of my favorite tracks on this album as well as all time. I love Taree, Bones of Birds and Black Saturday. I get into listening spells with Taree, and so many of these tracks because while they start off slow the song-writing is so good they land in a different universe at the end. So you can't help spinning it again. Listen man, they really accomplished something here. Its a perfect album. They spent 16 years away and simply land on top with King Animal. I for one think the art-work is first rate. White and Black are not actual colors but are lacking in color, and they pulled off something eerie and dark without taking the obvious route. My heart was broke in 1997 when they broke up and I swear I spent more than a few moments of every day gnashing my teeth at their demise. But here they are with a fresh bunch of tunes, and this is, right now, my favorite Soundgarden album.<br /><br />Pre-ordered this on Amazon, but couldn't wait for shipment so I bought the Best Buy version today too after hearing it for free on Itunes last week.<br />I love all these tracks, there is noB material here, but I really really like By Crooked Steps, A Thousand Days Before, Taree, Halfway There, Worse Dreams Bones of Birds and the leading 2 tracks.

B0000009SY|4.0|The only disappointing aspect of FZ's \\"Joe's Garage\\" is the fact that a pretty decent story begins to lose its' focus toward the end. It probably would have been better if there was only Act I, with most of the other material used out of context elsewhere. But who am I to second guess and question Zappa's creativity?<br /><br />This is FZ's \\"Tommy\\", if you will. I just think the storyline became too silly. On the other hand, sometimes humor DOES belong in music. This is, however, an essential FZ release. It's a shame this wasn't made into a film. I imagine Seth MacFarlane or Matt Groening could have created a great animated version to go along with the album.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|Full Disclosure: I am a HUGE Beatles nut, and I own the following:<br /><br />- 2009 Stereo CD's<br />- 2009 Mono CD's<br />- All their other CD's (1, Live at the BBC, Capital albums, Let it Be Naked, etc)<br />- The BC-13 Vinyl box set, as well as Love, Anthology, and a few more vinys<br /><br />My stereo system that I listen on is this:<br /><br />- Technics 1200 MKII Turntable<br />- Cambridge 640p phono preamp<br />- Polk RTi 12 speakers with Carver preamp<br /><br />So.  I contemplated even writing this review because in the end, how many people will it TRULY effect?  If you're considering spending $300+ on this set, then your mind is probably already made up.  And if you're one of \\"those\\" people that I will refer to in this review who are of the opinion that digitally sourced vinyl = garbage, then why are you even here anyway?  But I guess I just couldn't resist when I saw some of the negative thoughts from that particular peanut gallery.  So here it goes, for better or for worse.<br /><br />I received this set today and have currently listened (in order) from Please Please Me through Sgt. Pepper.  I'll start with the set visually; it's unmatched.  The box is great, the vinyl artwork is flawless, the sleeves are great, and the book is stunning.  The book alone should immediately make you feel justified in your purchase, it's that good.  I bet you say \\"Wow\\" the first time you start looking at it.<br /><br />Now for the sound.  There is always going to be a segment of the \\"hardcore\\" audiophile vinyl audience that is of the opinion that digitally sourced vinyl is pointless and that analog sourced vinyl is the only way to listen to it.  I've been reading a lot of opinions from these types of people online leading up to the launch of this set and honestly, it's depressing.  To me, these are people that are nearly IMPOSSIBLE to satisfy considering how much they obsess over every. single. little. nuance of whatever album/song/instrument/voice that's on their mind atthe time.  I've LITERALLY read opinions from people who said they had 12 different vinyl versions of Sgt Pepper saying that they can't imagine why they would buy this set.  REALLY?!  What exactly about this set makes 12 versions perfectly fine, but 13 out of the question?  If you're someone who is a big Beatles fan and wants to enjoy their music on the format that is easily the most \\"personal\\" of all, then this set is really all you need.<br /><br />Every album I've heard so far sounds fantastic.  The instruments stand out and the voices sound great.  I've done an A to B test of the BC-13 box (which is the precious analog that they all seem to love) and this set, and in no way is the BC-13 box \\"better.\\"  It may be different, fine.  But \\"better\\" in all of this is so unbelievably subjective it's not worth getting in to.  You'll find many people who say that the original 1960's pressings of these records sound the best, along with some German pressings of those years.  Those records can also go for upwards of $100 EACH online.  So basically you have to ask yourself the question is that slightly different sound worth spending a significantly larger amount of money to you?  What the hardcore people don't understand is that the answer for so many of us is \\"no\\" and it's perfectly fine that it's no, because these new releases sound GREAT.  I'm hearing little nuances that I haven't heard before, and I've literally heard these songs 1000's of times.<br /><br />If you want an absolutely stunning Beatles vinyl set at a price of about $23/record, this is where you should begin and end.  If you're absolutely obsessed with finding that \\"perfect\\" all analog pressing from the 1960's where Paul's voice sounds a little warmer on Got To Get You Into My Life, then why are you here in the first place?  Paul McCartney himself would tell these people that they're crazy.  This set sounds fantastic.

B000F8O35U|2.0|This Movie is clearly a copy and not an the manufactured edition of this movie.... The colors on the packagaing are wrong.. the silkscreening on the DVD is bad and the colors in the DVD itself are less then aceptable,,,,  will not purchase from this vedor again..
B009VB97EY|4.0|Fun movie and I love Channing Tatum.  It doesn't have much of an ending so don't expect too big of a finale.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I use the Kindle on my Galaxy Nexus Verizon phone and it works fine. The options are taking a while to get used to but I'm not complaining, but not bragging either.
B0085RZGYU|4.0|Another page turner from David Baldacci with a Camel Club cast.  Enjoyed the addition of Mary Chapman from the UK's  M12.  Hope to see her again in future stories.
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|Campy and funny.  It has humor and suspense.  The character interactions are funny and engaging.  It really makes for a great movie night.
B007ZZKWHY|5.0|What a movie. Nazis on the moon. Then they try to conquer the earth. Great and completely off the wall.

B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Skyfall's theme song by Adele is hauntingly beautiful...<br />Unfolding like a red rose under the full moon...<br /><br />However,<br />My only question is, Why is Skyfall's theme song not on the Soundtrack?!!!<br />Who made this grave error?!<br />HELLO! You need to put the same identical song line-up that<br />plays in the movie, record it as such and sell it as such and you will make more money and<br />we the consumer will have one big smile on our face :)<br /><br />Maybe that's just too simple and we know how some people must confuse<br />things that make sense!<br />Sorry, no sale over here!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|One of best movies I have seen in a while. Cannot wait for the sequel to come available.  Want action? Watch this one!
B009GYSQV6|4.0|It's an age old question. There are those among us who feel like music should strive to be cheerful in nature: that it should be something to lift our spirits and should always provide a rosy disposition. Yet there are others who see beauty in the bleakness, who view despair as a delicacy. If you're one of these, Crystal Castles has an album for you.<br /><br />They haven't taken long to leave their mark. After a promising debut in 2008, the Canadian electronic duo struck gold with their sophomore album II, one of the most distinctive electronic albums of the past several years. The release of III reinforces a striking fact about Crystal Castles that every album they have released are markedly different from one another.<br /><br />Their debut was a visceral, aural experience rife with clinking and clunking of old video game machines, while their sophomore release drew much more heavily from IDM and refined their production; the electronics on that record were as sharp as a razor's edge. Main composer Ethan Kath has ensured that III shares little in common with those, so it's tough to make a direct comparison. But it doesn't take long to determine that it's much more atmospheric and even more dream like than its predecessor.<br /><br />Crystal Castles have typically been a tough nut lyrically, with most of the vocals being glitched beyond comprehension. But would you have guessed Alice Glass as defender of the downtrodden? It seems to be what she's going for. In numerous interviews, she's spoken extensively on issues pertaining to women's rights and equality as well as flagging quality of life and limited rights of people around the world. These themes heavily inform III.<br /><br />Lead single \\"Plague\\" shares fears of military and economic oppression on a third world scale, while noting we may be contributing to this descent with our own actions. The music is carefully building up in the background, bubbling and broiling until Alice at last reaches her grand realization: \\"I am the plague!\\" Her sense of rage and apprehension is palpable from the instant you hit play.<br /><br />The theme is revisited several times later, including \\"Wrath of God,\\" where Alice's muffled voice warns against the loss of independence and heritage. With its thumping, throbbing bassline and its organ driven, cathedral like lead melody, this is techno that feels fit for the Sistine Chapel.<br /><br />The presence of muffled vocals is a recurring trend the band uses to augment the downbeat and dreary sound of the album. The technique shows up again on \\"Pale Flesh.\\" The lead in consists of high pitched, glitchy electronic work that pushes the upper frequencies of your sound system. Alice's voice is so muffled, echoy and reverb coated that it sounds more like a flock of birds frantically fluttering in their cages than an actual human voice. This is one of the most suffocating, bleak and oppressive songs on the disc, but it does soften up a bit here and there so as to allow time for some quiet musing.<br /><br />Some of their greatest opportunities to honestly affect a listener have come on their more melodic work, and they certainly haven't abandoned that. \\"Affection,\\" for example, has the heaviest IDM influences and as such resembles the material on II most closely. Like \\"Celestica,\\" it stakes its reputation on Alice's breathy vocals, and when her voice goes low it is truly one of the most stunning moments on the album.<br /><br />\\"Kerosene\\" is also one of the album's more melodic pieces. Its rumbling, phantasmal bass synth glides into your eardrums like a storm front billowing out of your headphones. It rests on a variety of glitch/IDM lead melodies to augment the effect, along with Alice's crystal clear vocals.<br /><br />One of the big strengths of III is its diversity  \\"Sad Eyes\\" is one of the album's heaviest rave pieces. A pulsating bass beat gyrates underneath, creating a hot dance stunner that still manages to evoke a cold emotional spectrum. \\"Insulin,\\" at just over a minute and a half, follows in the tradition of \\"Fainting Spells\\" and \\"Doe Deer\\" as one of the most difficult, dissonant, and experimental tracks in their catalog. A liberal static fuzz emotionally distances you from the track, while Glass's voice is garbled far past the point of recognition.<br /><br />Elsewhere, \\"Violent Youth\\" proves Crystal Castles are capable of injecting warmth into a song. With its fun, bouncy beat, it's easily the most upbeat of III's offerings. The low, warbling bass synth from \\"Kerosene\\" also shows up in a couple of other tracks, including \\"Transgender\\" and \\"Telepath.\\" \\"Telepath,\\" the album's only instrumental, goes through a variety of phases. It's very glitchy sounding at first, then becomes more spacey and atmospheric.<br /><br />Despite its violent title, album closer \\"Child I Will Hurt You\\" is quite the opposite of what you might think. Like their previous album closers \\"I Am Made of Chalk\\" and \\"Tell Me What To Swallow\\" it is much more downbeat and low key, while sounding nothing like either of those songs. \\"Child I Will Hurt You\\" presents a mellow, tranquil  and peaceful vibe for the first and only time on the album, while the twinkling electronica provides a familiar dreamlike element.<br /><br />Because each Crystal Castles album is so vastly different from one another, it all comes down to the listeners' own musical preference as to where III will rate in their catalog. This is an album dominated by rave elements,  atmospherics, and presents generally cold and bleak but beautiful sonic dimensions. Personally, II  is their most consistent album and therefore is a slightly stronger overall. But there are more than a few guy/girl electronic duos around, and none of them are nearly as distinctive as Crystal Castles. They have their own style, and the variety of ways in which they express it on III is truly remarkable. Tragedy doesn't have to be your true love to appreciate that.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great suspense and Love story... Keeps you reading more! Shows the Love a person can have for children ,and a story where abuse turns into a love story
B0055B7IPE|4.0|I looked at the movie with my ten year old nephew and we both enjoyed it very much.  I rented this movie mainly for my nephew but we both looked at it together and thought it was funny, not in an over the top manner, warm and had a very nice ending. The story line was simply yet believable. I recommend this movie.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|A film for every age. No matter how many times you watch this film, who has a dry eye when Mrs. Jumbo sings \\"Baby Mine\\" to Dumbo and gently rocks him in her trunk through the bars of her prison? What's even more amazing is that the star of this feature never utters a word or makes a sound. Disney magic through and through.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This story is so compelling and expertly told that the book is very difficult to put down. When I was finished, I missed being able to read it. There have been many stories about near death experiences, but this man's qualifications as a neurosurgeon, and his ability to keep close reference to the facts makes the story very beleivable.
B002BWP49C|5.0|The scenery, makeup, effects are undeniably mesmerizing. These are pretty people. It's fantasy. Who doesn't want to be young and beautiful forever? It's entertainment, escape. Guilty pleasure.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is so fun! You get 2 buy cool things at the shop such as new characters 2 play with. You can also upgrade your speed, how fast your dude runs and so much more! 2 find out more..... get the game! Its not that hard of a task.
0316228532|1.0|Like most die-hard fans of the Harry Potter series, I eagerly looked forward to J.K. Rowling's next book.  It is my hope that she sticks to children's books where she shines like the brightest star in the solar system.  I have, in fact, tried to emulate her ease of conveyance of ideas and descriptions in my own writing.<br /><br />This book, however, was a bomb. It is a tawdry, tedious, non-noteworthy little British soap opera.  The best thing that can be said for it is to point to Rowling's descriptive powers of observation of the mental processes of the characters about which she writes. She can describe a physical, or psychological event in clear, concise verbiage that I have never seen any other writer pull off.<br /><br />That being said, the main plot, if one can even call it that has way too many characters not easily tied together in this overlong, exceedingly boring tale of nothingness.  It is not a social statement, but an elongated look at extreme ordinariness that simply goes on forever.  Lower echelon suburbia in Britain is probably the best description that I have for this book of adult fiction.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|but this is not 2099.this app is amasing great good and esay to donlod .the game lets you chose how hard the computir is.
1451613512|5.0|I don't think I've ever enjoyed reading a history book as much as I enjoyed reading this one.<br /><br />Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick have created a comprehensive and lively read that offers their readers a fantastic collection of intriguing historical details, little-known facts, and great cocktail party trivia. I plan to give this to many of my friends and family during the upcoming holiday season.<br /><br />This is definitely not your high school history textbook--highly recommend!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Received this yesterday and watched it well into the night!  This Blu-Ray ranks with Barry Lyndon and The Searchers as the best looking Blu-Ray of a classic film I have ever seen.  Columbia did a very nice job on the restoration.................it took them long enough to get this movie on Blu-Ray. A lot of fans have been waiting a long time for this package.  You will be pleased with the visual results, and the sound track is pretty good though not as impressive as the image.<br /><br />I am not going get into any review of the quality of the film as cinema..............reams have been written about this flick, and all I can say is Peter O'Toole gives maybe the greatest performance in the history of cinema as Lawrence............It is so nice to watch an epic film without cgi at all.  Can you imagine if this film were made today?  Can you say cgi camels???<br /><br />This package is a HUGE upgrade over the standard DVD I have owned for years.................Truly one of the great ones.............highest recommendation.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|ive paid more and got way less game for the money. buy far enigmatis is the best interactive hidden object game experience that ive had. and only cost 2 dollars when I paid for it.a must. play for for hours of fun.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I like it. thanks. free. well, ads pay for it. the end game is easier than the opening, at least on easier settings.
030758836X|2.0|I am fairly new to reading (as a disclaimer) -- and I was really disappointed in this book:(  It's a roller coaster of a plot, very well thought out - I'll add, but hideous ending!  I had to read it for Book Club, and would not recommend it.  Unless of course you are into a simply-well-written plot with developed characters (which a lot are) -- but our Book Club had only 2 who enjoyed it.  And they are straight BOOKies!  Sad, b/c it came highly recommended to us!  Not a fav!
B00023B1A8|5.0|Best of the best of these three. Highly recommed this DVD.  This minimum requiement for this &#34;required written review&#34; is going to stop me from reviewing any other purchases.  FYI.
B008C20TDG|3.0|There is nothing about this book that their website and a few good cookbooks couldn't accomplish.  Half is made up with the science behind what foods do to our bodies, which is good information but something one couldn't find researching on the internet.  The rest is good information but here again, a lot of it is on the website.  I am very impressed with the cookbook they refer to called \\"Well Fed\\" and which I own (that would be the better money spent).
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have been using it for about a month now and I put everything in it! I even use the email and it works great. Great piece of software.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|At last a fragment of storyline to swell the so far paltry offering.  Was it worth having to read the first two books? No.  The first two books are so lacking in all but the sex acts that  you could quite easily just read the third and have lost nothing. All in all if someone else had not funded it, they are not worth the cash. They are so sparse in content that it should only be one book.  As a literary achievement it is, in my opinion, on a level of standard with a teenage chat magazine.
B0015KGWZG|5.0|A dear friend recommended this book to me while I was going through a difficult time. It helped me a lot. It has very logical conclusions to every-day problems we face. It gives you a new perspective of things and makes you realize that we could handle it better. The book will make you happy!
B008FSCNTK|3.0|As alsways, Krall plays the piano and sings with exceptional talent.  Compared to her other albums I have, I found the selection of music on Glad Rag Doll not as satisfactory.
B009CPEOC4|4.0|Very cute movie- you would never realize how much goes into running a successful world tour. I was exhausted for her just by watching it! LOL! Katy is very talented and it was nice to learn about her background, meet her family (her grandmother is the cutest little lady ever!) and understand what she had to overcome to get to the top. My 6 year old daughter and I enjoyed it very much- my 10 year old son...not so much! It seems to be geared toward the females..
B009YU9J0E|3.0|Ive been a fan of the Crystal Castles since before they became all the praise. Love the darkness they bring to electronic music. Been waiting forever for this album to come out like so many other fans. Woke up early today just to pick up this album. ive listened to it a few times and im kind of dissappointed....i understand that they wanted to give their fans new sounds but this new sound sounds far too much like other bands these days. For example, purity ring and Salem. While the song writing is greater than its ever been, there are far too many songs on here that just dont seem to have that crystal castles touch we all fell in love with. There are some ok songs on here  like \\"wrath of god\\" and \\"sad Eyes\\" and then theres some really horrible songs like \\"insulin\\" which is nothing but screeching noise with a beat of a drum. If there is one gem on here it would have to be \\"Violent Youth\\" and \\"Plague\\". They both are absolutely beautiful songs. And they actually sound like the crystal castles we love.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I'm obsessed with this compelling book. It's page-turning, really well-written, and engaging !  I highly recommend it ! I;m excited about the third installment !!
B00914JWSW|5.0|Barbra at her best throughout. Track 10 wasn't recorded 25 years ago or more, but the purity of her vocal remains today. She is the best vocalist for this genre; fans like me can't stay away for one minute or for one more album like this. Really. Release some more.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a great free app to have,very useful to see how much time you have left before needing to recharge your kindle
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|This is a beautifully sung cd...it was calm, (except for the last song) but very sweet and touching for any woman who is a mother or mother-to -be.  It blended well in the background, and was a pleasure to listen to.  Afterwards, the cd was given to the Mother-to-Be to take home for her collection.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Just seems to follow a formula like his last few books. Rather confusing at times too. Wish he would write another documentary.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Fifty shades Freed kept me wanting to continue reading even when I had other things I should have been doing.  It has more action and intrigue,  than the first two books.  I was always thinking what would happen next.  A little less of the kinky sex than the first two books so I enjoined it more.
B001RIY4WE|1.0|Well I will admit that this was an awesome movie...on DVD, but for some reason Skynet has infected my BlueRay player and this stupid thing just doesnt work. If I am connected to the internet, it hangs forever....and if I disconnect the internet it tells me it has to be connected to play. Are you serious? I want to take a hammer to this disc and tell it that \\"it's terminated\\"...What a waste.You should be able to play the movie without all the nerdy effects and add-ons. Some intern got turned loose on this project after going through the terminator experience at Universal Studios in Florida years ago. BOOOOOO on this BooRay.....PFFFFTTTT!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Though not as good as season 1, so exciting and I love that the show is not afraid to go that extra mile. Killing off main characters, making others suffer. Great new characters introduced after some flat ones in the second season!
030758836X|4.0|Found the first half of the book to be a bit slower than the last, but reading it was well worth it. It is adeptly written and full of twists and turns. A fun read.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|I like this game but could use less chatter (reading). Spent more time reading and tapping to get to games.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book .the writer really painted the story well I felt like I was there  can't wait for more.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I'm a STRONG directioner, I've loved them since the X-factor. Along with fan fictions. GOOD ALBUM!!:D<br />The songs are less Up-beat on this album.
B009G9Z08S|5.0|I'm a Batman freak and this movie delivered. Really good all the way. I read the comic and this was loyal to it as well. Highly recommended.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Great book. I was actually quite impressed with the amount of humor that was portrayed in the book. I am looking forward to the fourth book, \\"Trapped\\". Highly recommend the series.
B0053O89XI|4.0|TBBT is a great show and Season 5 was awesome just like the previous seasons. I would have rated it 5 stars if it the Ultroviolet included itunes digital download like so many titles have done in the last year. I have a flixster account and have the app on my iPad 3, but I'd much rather just have it on my Apple TV as an itunes digital download. I know i can use AirPlay Mirroring on my iPad or MacBook Pro, but that's such a pain and usually creates a lag issue. Streaming directly on the Apple TV is the preferred method, so I wish they would continue giving itunes codes along with the awful Flixster codes.
B001M5UDGS|4.0|Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog has an interesting story line that can be enjoyed by all people.  Don't let the title scare you off, it might not seem the most entertaining but you'll be in for a treat.  The movie has many different aspects to it that make it very entertaining.  There are also a few elements that could be broken down in this film; they would be colors, the characters, and the setting.  Pathos was also a big element of this film that can't be ignored.  The film Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog can be enjoyed by all ages because of its interesting storyline and appealing characters.<br />The setting for this movie revolves around the main character, Dr. Horrible.  He is either filming a blog for his views, acting as an evil villain, or doing his laundry with Penny.  Penny is a woman that Dr. Horrible has a huge crush on but doesn't know how to talk to her.  The catchy tunes that they sing throughout the movie will get stuck in your head but you won't mind, they are very enjoyable.  There is also another interesting character, Captain Hammer.  He takes the place of a hero since Dr. Horrible is presumably the villain even though you don't view him that way.  You probably won't view Captain Hammer has the hero but as a villain.  This is because of pathos, the appeal using emotion.  The audience is more emotionally attached to Dr. Horrible than Captain Hammer because Hammer can be seen as a woman stealer since he took Penny away from Dr. Horrible.<br />Colors are also an interesting aspect in this film.  Dr. Horrible wears a white lab coat for most of the movie while Captain Hammer wears predominately black clothing.  White signifies the innocence of Dr. Horrible and the black expresses the evil in which Hammer possesses.  Then after something catastrophic and unpredictable happens Horrible wears a red lab coat instead of the white one.  Red is the color that expresses love and passion so I believe he's wearing a red coat to show he lost something that he loved.<br />Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog will take you on an eventful ride and captivate you from the very beginning.  It has romance, comedy, and action which will peak the interest of any viewer.  This film also won't disappoint if you enjoy watching the characters use different technology throughout the film.  It establishes pathos which will appeal to your emotions more and more as you get further into the movie.  The storyline and setting are very interesting along with the characters and very good acting.  I'd recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a good laugh, a romance, or an action packed movie.
B0091LF2QQ|5.0|It is slightly different to the other Mika CD's but after a few listens I am loving it just as much if not more than the others. :)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|love this app. I play this on facebook and can now play on my kindle fire. wish the tournment was available on the app and the total credits were easier to see on my fire.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|I just purchased this cd yesterday and I can't stop listening to it. Christina sounds amazing and she looks fantastic. I luv the song \\"Your Body\\" but my two new faves are \\"Red Hot Kinda Love \\" and \\"Let There Be Love\\". Slammin! And I really like the duet \\"Just A Fool\\" with Blake Shelton, who would of thought two styles would mesh so beautifully together.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As always Patricia Cornwell delivers a great read.  I've been a Scarpetta fan since the first book and have enjoyed getting to know the characters over the year. Hope there will be another soon and I'll preorder it as I always do.
B001LF347E|5.0|Watched all three seasons on TV (Syfy) and then bought DVDs to watch again.  Well written family show that can be enjoyed by all ages.  Just too bad we have to wait so long for the newer seasons.
1250004217|3.0|A great number of subject material is out there for the Holocaust, but told from the perspective of a little girl in the French round-up of Jews is at least new and exciting enough to warrant a read. Unfortunately, the tale of a middle-aged woman interrupts the otherwise interesting story as she prattles on about her French husband, who lasts for all of about half of the book before being painted as the villain, her work and her daughter, who is as unrelatable a character as any other child character. Her melodramatic whining and utterly predictable naming of her child by the end ruins the otherwise harrowing tale of a young refugee.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Extremely funny at lots of parts as all of his books always are. I am not sure how the first part with the flashback really tied in with the dance. The first part kind of seemed like a filler but I would definitely reccomend this book.
B005HSL626|5.0|My son is 4 and he loves this game. He can play it over and over, its easy to work and loves the star ratings at the end of each play.
B001BZGA8Y|5.0|excellent product, very well done, good presentation, the case is excellent, very fine. It is elegant, very nice watch, top brand.
B004EPZ06G|1.0|Please don't waste your time.  There is nothing funny or entertaining about this movie.  The characters have no depth or backstory or commonsense.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love it... I love Lucy Lui either way, but I feel they work well off each other. You can feel the bond they're building with each episode... or at least more puzzle pieces found to help complete the mystery of each of the characters. Both are brilliant in their own way. They're good for each other!

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|If you were able to travel far enough away to find a place filled with unimaginable wisdom and unbelievable things, then you would find Susan Boyle there.  In a place you could only imagine once existed or could exist.  With this precious album, Susan delivers the goods from that cherished place.  She puts them straight into our hearts.  Applause, curtsey, embrace, hats off, palms together, moment of silence, salute, praise, honor, commend.  Forever a follower of hers.  Grateful and at peace.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book was a great read. It took you on an up and down roller coaster. I can't wait until the movies comes out. There are few men in hollywood that could resemble him. Sometimes the book jump out of reality. It seemed too fake at different times.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|Entertaining, thought provoking, and an interesting play on how different cultures would interact. Some good laid-back humour, too. The outcome was predictable but a worthwhile journey to get there.
B0034KZE9U|5.0|I have been working in food service for the last 5 years and in those have gone through about 8 \\"food service\\" shoes. After hearing about these from a friend I decided to give them a try and I can say I am not at all disappointed.<br />-They cushion while standing<br />-Have good support for moving<br />-They give you just a hint of a massage every step you take!<br /><br /> Best shoe I have ever owned for comfort. Only downside is they look almost like clown shoes they are so big (Think LOTS of Cushion). I know the shoe I will be wearing for work for the rest of my life though.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I have researched a bit looking up why the minority reviewers here gave The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season the lowest rating--1 star. What stood out to me were reasons of poor acting and being very predictable. I have yet to hint any poor acting by the actors and it is not really predictable from where I stand. The acting is quite superb and this is not an understatement; the actors are not the typical soap opera actors on afternoon TV. They each have that little something that evolves into a huge flow of depth expressed in dialogue and emotion. I keep an open mind when I watch each episode to the acting and to say it is a joke, not funny. But to each his own.<br /><br />As to my own review of the first season, it is just spectacular. I am a fan of zombies. I enjoy a movie depicting endless zombies furnished with a small group of survivors trying to overcome their odds to stay alive. This fits the description of The Walking Dead yet not in its entirety. As opposed to many movies in the typical zombie apocalypse plot, this series is very unique in that it heavily makes you think and critique every character and their actions. The relationships between them interacts so vividly I dare to say The Walking Dead is not so much about zombies and blasting them to smithereens with shotguns, revolvers and the all-so silent melee weapons like a baseball bat or sword than it is the love-hate and personal demons circulating about. This field is not explored much by the zombie-genre and it has always been missing until now.<br /><br />Speaking of characters, the love-hate factor is evident right from the beginning. The same feelings will not always be there as you will change due to the fact character development is literally on steroids here. It is almost like a biography of every one packed into a series.<br /><br />In summary, the action is all there just like any other zombie movie you would expect.

B000002UA7|3.0|I bought this CD as a gift for a woman I was seeing. She didn't thank me and soon dumped me via text message. I cant blame the CD, don't realy know the artist, but ouch...leaves a bad taste in my mouth. How do you like my highly personalized opinion/review?  LOL  tired of Amazon wanting me to review the CD, keeps popping up, bad memories....
B007THA4FI|5.0|You could feel the pain of they were going through. Ending was so powerful unexpected. When I saw her interview she stated if you don't cry at then end of the book somethings wrong. She's right.  She is a brilliant writer. This book just sucked me in
B00536OCZA|5.0|Classic album with some new additions, includes a couple of posters that are pretty sweet. Two thumbs up and a must buy if you're a fan.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy this game very much. It is a very challenging.  You did a very good job guys. I highly recommend it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|weight + motion + G force = destination!  Anyway, I'm glad its not like angry birds.  Because ITS NOT!  HELLO??!!  very easy and fun to play.  try it or not.  I'm glad I did.  All the winers... too bad for you.  lol I'm using the KF and never had a loss of game or glitching.  turn off in app purchasing in settings/more to IAP then turn off, enter pass. TADAA!  Easy as cake!  take care.....
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Good to see them all together with the extended films. The special effects got better as the series progressed.<br />Excellent pricing on this pack with CD's of the original and the updated / extended movies.
1400052173|4.0|I read this book last year and I still feel the same way today. I enjoyed learning about HeLa and its contributions to science/medicine, and the woman behind the remarkable discovery. What I didn't enjoy was all the background information about Henrietta and her family. This book in no way vindicated the experiences of Henrietta's children, particularly Deborah. The only thing the reader can do is pity the family. I think Skloots should have walked a finer line while writing (and the editors as well) so that the family's culture of origin wouldn't come off as comical, and wouldn't disturb the totality of the book and Henrietta's (HeLa) legacy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|While the ending wasn't what I was hoping for, the story was great.  The way the author tells his and her stories made for a fast read.  Like looking over someones diary.  Didn't regret buying this one.
B005R32L66|4.0|HAVE A D2 AND DOWNLOAD WAS VERY SIMPLE<br />FROM AMAZON. USE IS NOT HARD AND HAVE TO<br />SIGN UP AND CONNECT WITH YOUR FRIENDS.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This Season has been amazing so far.  Pretty much blows the other 2 away.  So glad Merle is back!  I can't wait to see what happens with the baby, and how Rick is going to deal with his best friend AND now wife now being gone.  I don't mind too much that Lori is out of the picture.  Now, if they can just get rid of Andrea!
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Nothing too complicated here. Simpler than Angry Birds. Different dynamic. Easier, but still fun. My little one enjoys it. I wouldn't get bent out of shape over permissions.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ugh. Three books of &#34;I love him but he's bad for me!&#34; if you are like the other soccer moms and feel the need to read it, go ahead. But the whole thing is as bad as Bella's constant whining and complaining in the second &#34;twilight&#34; book after Edward leaves her for her own good. The story drives the point home that women will let a man treat them like total crap as long as a man is rich, handsome, powerful, and has a huge wang. And if you can't get enough, there are two more books of the same thing. Save your money and read this one three times.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|I liked the movie quite a bit, but was blown away by the intellectual quality of Roger Ebert's commentary in the special features, that's why I added this \\"review\\".  Check it out.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|One of my favorite recent reads. I plow through a book in a couple of days. I had to stop myself at some points so I wouldn't finish it so quickly. It was a good mystery without being over the top. Another win for Lee Child.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I can put a mean edge on a knife with just about any stone, this is a very good tool for expert to novice and very easy to use. shaves on a nice edge with very little effort and so eay to carry around ( very compact). I am going to order 3 more to put in vehicles and all my packs.
B008NEVP1S|4.0|I received this album this morning and have listened straight through 4-5 times so far.  If you're a fan, you'll like this.  If you weren't a fan previously, I don't see how you couldn't enjoy it.<br /><br />There are great lyricists and there are great songwriters.  It's not very often that someone is a standout at both, but Aimee is.  Add her amazing voice on top of the two and you have someone with a nearly unmatched slate of talents.  The chord structures are what you've come to expect and most every song features the bridge that just drops in perfectly, punctuating and strenghthening each song and the album as a whole.  If you know her music, you know what I mean.<br /><br />The only song here resembling a low spot would be \\"Red Flag Diver\\", which doesn't quite hold up to the impossibly high standard of the rest of the material.  Most records have 1-2 great songs.  Here, we have 6-7, with my favorites bring \\"Slip and Roll\\" and \\"Soon Enough\\".  I'm a sucker for the slow ones that really put Aimee's voice up front, uncontested by a lot of instrumentation.  The poppy, keyboard-laden title track starts things off on an energetic high note and the rest of the album sort of follows its own flow thereafter.<br /><br />As for the professional music critics complaining about no new ground being broken here, I can't entirely disagree, and that's a good thing.  There's a new-ish pop sentimentality at work, which is a change.  As for whether a change is needed or should be expected, Michaelangelo didn't dabble in impressionism, either.  What we have in \\"Charmer\\" is a well-crafted record from a tremendously talented and amazingly consistent artist - again.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game is addictive, but i prefer angry birds. This game takes more mind logic and is not as stress relieving.<br />i like the game and like to play games made by this wonderful creator of apps.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a Very interesting book and a reliable author.  Based on his own actual experience.  I give it an &#34;A&#34;
1423113497|5.0|My son can't put them down. These books are great reading for middle school age students. Great service. I would purchase the entire set.
1451695195|1.0|When I cracked open this book I received as a birthday present, I was instantly taken for a ride. This book is very well written and interesting, and initially describes his meningitis quite scientifically. If an interesting (not necessarily factual) read is what you're looking for, this book is for you. No sarcasm. It really is an interesting read. If that's all you want, stop reading this review immediately.<br /><br />But for fellow Christians and/or truth-seekers, there's a big problem.<br /><br />This is book is not Christian at all.<br /><br />Jesus is mentioned once in the book as a side comment on pg. 134 about some else's NDE (near death experience). Neither \\"Christ\\" nor \\"Jesus\\" is found in the index, while the \\"The Core\\", \\"The Gateway\\" and \\"The beings\\"  are mentioned upwards of twenty times a chapter. This book talks about many New Age concepts (viz. \\"Opening your Third Eye\\" \\"We will all one day recover our true spiritual potential\\", etc.), and exalts human beings greatly (you have free will, you are in control of your life, etc.) It does not preach the cross of Christ. The blood of Jesus is not mentioned. Faith and repentance? Hah, what need have we of that when we have dull, uninteresting, standard New Age spirituality crap?<br /><br />I completely believe this spiritual experience took place. I just believe he did not experience Heaven.<br /><br />While reading this book, interesting questions to ask yourself are:<br />1) How do 2 Cor 11:14-15 and Gal 1:8-9 apply to this book (and the quote I give at the end of the review)?<br />2) If this experience is really from God, how come the Holy Spirit didn't glorify Jesus by making Him known (Jn 16:14)?<br />3) This book espouses MACROEVOLUTION. How does that pair up with Genesis 2?<br />4) Humans are glorified as having free will all throughout the book. How does this match up with Romans 9:16?<br />5) In both the Old and New Testament, the main highlight of Heaven is portrayed as the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb - who are the temple of the city (Rev 22:21), the one who sits on the throne (Isaiah 6, Ezek 1:26-28, Dan 7:9-10, etc). Why isn't this mentioned in a book \\"about Heaven\\"?<br /><br />I could make many more observations on the book's unbiblicalness (is that a word?), but instead I shall end with a quote which every Christian can easily see is satanic:<br />\\"... Why am I so sure of all this? For two reasons. The first is that I was shown it (by the beings who taught me when I was in the Gateway and the Core), and the second is because I actually experienced it. [sic.]\\"
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really wasn't. sure what I would think of it at first but its def. caught my attention and managed. to keep it!
1419705849|5.0|This review is from my son Daniel. This is a review of Diary of a Wimpy Kid 7. It is the latest book in the Wimpy Kid series. It has 217 pages like the rest of the books. There are only two months in the book, January and February. Both of them have holidays like New Year and Valentine's Day. The color of the book is brownish red. I like the book because the title page has a picture of Greg's Uncle Gary. It was my favorite book because in the story there is a restaurant called Corny's. And it is mentioned at the beginning and the end of the book. I also like it because they mention someone named Johnny Cheddar who is one of Manny's many imaginary friends. The story was my favorite one because they ended the book to be continued. I recommend it to people who like the fifth and sixth books and people who are looking for something funny to read.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|If you Google this release, it is clear that Rick Davies didn't want it released at all (quality issues?), nor did Roger Hodgson (however Roger was interested in having it released, but he claims that Eagle Rock didn't get his approval or input...and did NOT note who wrote the material).<br /><br />I can't see this being on the market for too long, given the aforementioned.  So...GET IT NOW!<br /><br />While the Supertramp 1983 show from Munich is really good, the quality of this show is STELLAR!  Listening to Supertramp's PARIS album since I was a kid, I always wondered how the material was presented.  Back in the 1970's, they were amazing on stage.  It's sad that Roger and Rick couldn't \\"work it out\\", as they were a fantastic band, who wrote really great songs.  I suspect the controversy will continue to further the gap between them (and now, John, Bob and Dougie).<br /><br />Enjoy this while you can.  Once it's sold out, I'm sure it will be going for a lot on Ebay.  It's region-free, so if you live in the US, don't sweat it...it will work.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love the visuals, clear and concise diplay, shows real time numbers such as time to charge via usb v.s. fast port charging, estimates for reading plaing games internet usage.awesome and not a memory hog.
B002NPXGUQ|3.0|I have nothing to complain about in terms of the music or the album, but I have a very big issue with this whole \\"limited edition\\" marketing scheme. I mean really, this ain't limited edition, they literally have more of these in stock getting ready to ship worldwide to different record sellers. This ain't limited edition, none of these records are.....
B0086700CM|3.0|They seem to enjoy it.  The seven year old in particular, but the five year old got the hang of it pretty easily too.
B00845POUO|5.0|As it is a true story and I have lived in Africa I found it immensely interesting. also I think Gerard Butler portrays<br />the real person very well indeed. At times brutal but very realistic.
141659521X|4.0|Fans will not be disappointed! Mr Flynn treats us to another fun read, after lulling us to sleep with the last two prequeals.<br /><br />Mitch Rapp is sent to Afghanistan to investigate the kidnapping of a high value CIA agent, and after an ensuing violent shootout, it seems someone is trying to discredit the Clandestine Service of the Agency. The Energizer Bunny who keeps killing and killing (as discribed by one of the books antagonists) is on his game, along with Irene Kennedy who ventures into the field to lend a hand (we could surely use a person like her at the head of the CIA today), and provides direction with a no holds barred attitude.<br /><br />There are a few nice twists or misdirections along the way and some interesting characters, who I'm sure will reappear in a future book(s). I especially enjoyed the brief appearance, of the fire breathing 4 foot 11 inch USAF \\"Command Master Sargent\\" Sanchez, and hope she has a future on Irene's administrative staff....you're gonna love her!
B007UR1OHO|5.0|The story was really good. I would recommend it. It was nice to watch with the family. Watch trailer before purchasing.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this app is the best app ever Rovio Entertainment Ltd.&reg; really did a good job with every feature i mean really the red bird actu
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I watched this movie in theaters and knew I had to own it, the action is really good and the graphics are awesome.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I'm totally addicted to HOMELAND and can't wait to finish season 1 and get into season 2.  At this rate I may even get Showtime since I'm paying a buck 99 an episode to see this masterpiece!
B009G78EE2|5.0|Mixture of fun and serious, along with every person / life experiences makes this a great album from beginning to end. I appreciate and like what they bring to the hip hop community as an independent artist.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|That's the first Stone's song that I remember listening to as a kid.  Beatles vs. Stones?  I'm Beatles all the way, but that's not to take anything away from what the Stones contributed.  I pretty much like everything about the Stones,  except maybe Jagger.  Keith is a rock god.  Charlie is among my favorite drummers, and I have nearly everything released by Bill Wyman, but I've just never collected the Stones.  Now I have SATISFACTION.<br /><br />This is a great compilation for those who haven't loyally collected everything from day one.  Being a die-hard Beatlez collector, I can relate to the criticisms of the Stone's fans
B007TXN4TK|5.0|It's a nice little game. I wish they had something like that for a full piano. Maybe they already do.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app is amazing, it works great on my Kindle Fire and I haven't had a single problem with it. Its also very addicting. I just wanted to see what it was like but then I got sucked in..&infin;
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Awesome movie.  Depp put a more comical twist in this version.  I also loved the short appearance of Fridd, the original Barnibus Collins.  I love the original version still, but great movie.
B008DM4OTA|2.0|Toddler reacted very negatively to some of the sounds - eespecially the \\"ear\\" which does have a bit of a scary odd \\"growling\\" type noise.<br />She is not usually afraid of things, loves most narrated stories etc  but did not like this game at all. saving it for later
B00846TTDG|4.0|Some people think that this movie shouldn't get 5 stars and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. As for me I thoroughly enjoyed the movie maybe it's because I like military video games and movies but this movie which is portrayed by real SEALs out did my expectations.<br /><br />The acting was average from the SEALs but, give them a break they aren't going to acting school and they aren't the Tom Hanks/ Tom Cruise of our generation. They are strictly trained to fulfill any mission on their plate. I for one really didn't care for the acting.<br /><br />The fighting scenes were breathtaking because you really get to see similar situation missions that are overseas in Iraq and in Afghanistan. The weapons and explosions that the military are only required to have its good to see how they are actually used and get a sense of what the soldiers go through on a regular basis.<br />Seeing this film makes me appreciate every solider that's fought in war and put their lives on the line everyday.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Never thought I would like a TV series as much as Breaking Bad, but here it is. Outstanding in every way.
B0060CXAHC|4.0|Great movie, love the SciFi piece in the movie. Lilo is such an amazing character, one of my favorite Disney characters ever.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Could not wait to finish.. It was one of the best characters ever.. I hope he writes some more about him.  I can see it as a movie.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This movie was much more enjoyable than I thought it was going to be. Good story and Action sequences. I would definately watch this movie again and recommend it to anyone.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a really awesome game. I love to play it .You jump gaps,duck arches,and you are running away from monkeys.I very much recommend this game.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie, even with subtitles, is such an amazing film. No matter what you think of Mel Gibson personally, he knows how to get a message across on the screen. Incredible photo shoots. A must see. He knows his Bible. The symbolism in this movie is right on.
B001BWQWKS|5.0|The consensus is correct:  an exquisitely played, exquisitely nuanced performance of 3 masterpieces of the genre.  The beauty is almost overwhelming, but handled superbly by the performers
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Good movie. Has a good story and a good moral. I loved it as much as the kids. The animation is great.
B009H442DG|5.0|Pardon me for being in the minority who recall their lovely David Foster-produced duet \\"Take A Chance\\" from the 1983 flick \\"Two of a Kind\\" soundtrack, but fortunately we have not really had to wait 35 years for this recording - only 29!  (Ah, the magic of 29!)<br /><br />It is a joy to hear these two on record again. And good on their choices of guest stars, too. I think the Tony Bennett collaboration has the most fun feel of it - just listen to Ms Newton-John's spirited laughter at the end of it.<br /><br />*I would recommend getting a physical CD of this, unless the digital download offers a PDF of the booklet. The liner notes are very well done and the photos add to the overall feel of this feel-good Christmas record.<br /><br />There's little gimmickry on this album; it sounds like two friends who got together in a studio and laid down tracks of songs that they love, and loved making them together. What more could we need? Years pass, but John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are undoubtedly the ones that we want!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I LOVE the automatic downloads.  When I am ready to go to the next book it is there within seconds.  Love this story!
B009NPKTN6|3.0|Not exactly what we expected<br />Did not realize it was a musical type of movie<br />I would say it was mildly amusing though
B0086DBE62|2.0|Over acted, boring and utterly perdictable. Normally, I love Roberts but she wasn't believable in this role.  Also, the plot wasn't new or fresh.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|My husband and I had a fun night at home with this show.<br />Bruce Willis was good, and the two kids were g<br />Typical kids of their age
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of my favorite games to play. You have to connect one dot to the other dot of the same color.  You also have to do it so that every single square is covered. I would recommend this to anyone. This game is very fun and addictive.
B0081HLM2E|2.0|There are some attractive second growth woodlands in this film - our unattractive, dishonest, self-centered, whining leading man spends a lot of time running through them to make his rather implausible escapes. It was hard for me to imagine the beautiful blonde could have or should have ever cared for him. I am sure there is some satiric intention here aimed at the corporate world but I found it all rather predictable, not suspenseful. Keep your money  to save up for a good painting.
B008PC1GF8|5.0|The present recording under review is not only a single disc re-release of a previous two CD set from Deutsche Grammophon but a re-mastering of that original release.  Let me dispense with the \\"sonics\\" first.  Any audiophile will appreciate the re-mastering effort that went into this fine recording.  Often, manufacturers will compress the sound to fit a longer piece of music such as the Bruckner Eighth Symphony on to a single CD.  Clearly, in this instance, that is not the case and in comparing this \\"The Originals\\" re-issue with the earlier two-disc set, the sound quality is superior in almost every respect, a real plus for those audiophile/music lovers who want excellent sound reproduction from their sound systems.<br /><br />On to the review itself: which Bruckner Eight Symphony to buy? Happily, there are many outstanding recordings of this monumental work, so that any one of these could easily serve as that proverbial \\"If I had to take one recording of the Bruckner Eighth with me to a desert island, which one would it be?\\"  The 1951 Hans Knappertsbusch Bruckner Eighth with the Berlin Philharmonic is a fabulous performance.  So too is the Georg Solti/Vienna Philharmonic (not the Chicago Symphony version) recorded soon after Solti's Ring of the Nibelung cycle.  (For sheer dramatic intensity, it's hard to beat that recording!)  The Eugene Jochum with the Staatskapelle Dresden is another winner as is the Horenstein/BBC performance. All of these performances are totally satisfying in different ways and leave little to be desired and communicate the power and majesty of Bruckner's symphonic writing.<br /><br />Which brings me to the present recording, the very last performance committed to recorded posterity before Maestro Von Karajan's death.  One thing is for sure.  Of the last three symphonies of Anton Bruckner, the mighty Eighth is probably the most difficult symphony to get into and yet holds the most rewards for one's repeated efforts at listening.  In this recording, Von Karajan takes a more deliberate and slower-paced interpretation, bringing out nuances of musical meaning that reveal the amazing architectural complexity of this work.  This is an extraordinary and galvanizing performance by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra played with proper reverence under Von Karajan's masterful baton.  That this<br />performance is now available on a budget price makes buying this CD a no-brainer.<br /><br />On the other hand, I \\"cut my teeth\\" on the old EMI/Angel LP recording of the Von Karajan Bruckner Eighth performed by the Berlin Philharmonic back in the early 60's.  The LP I grew up with is still available in CD and because it was an analog recording, I personally prefer the sound quality over all the later digital recordings.  In comparing Von Karajan's two recordings, I admire the later VPO recording but I am still in love with the earlier BPO version.  In that recording, Von Karajan adopted a more passionate approach to the music- I would say that his interpretation lies halfway between the Solti Eighth and this Von Karajan/VPO performance, so, for me, it's the best of both worlds.<br /><br />My recommendation is that if you are able to find a copy of the earlier version either on LP or CD, snatch it up.  To have both of these wonderful recordings is a rich blessing that any true Bruckner devotee would be thrilled to own.  In any event, the present Bruckner Eighth on this \\"The Originals\\" series is highly recommended and will serve as wonderful introduction to Bruckner's masterpiece.ding, Von Karajan takes a more deliberate and slower-paced interpretation, bringing out nuances of musical meaning that reveal the amazing architectural complexity of this work.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I am still humming the song fron the Phantom of the Opera.  I am amazed at Susan's ability to have a steady voice and endless breath control, and such a clear voice.  She has such ability and yet seems to have kept her humility.  The arrangements of her songs were unique, and favorably effective.  I enjoyed all the selections, the pairing of her with the Phantom singer, and Donny Osmond and tho I have all her cds I think this is the best. Thanks to Simon Cowle for what ever help he has provided for Susan.

0812993292|3.0|Harold Fry and his wife go through an evolution of personal struggles during his pilgrimage. I found this to be wonderfully revealing. However, my greatest annoyance with this book was that I thought it was quite needless for the author to depict Queenie in such a grotesque physical manner. Ms. Joyce could have made her point in a more suitable manner in accordance with the writing style of the novel.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|After receiving the CD from Amazon, I played it over and over like an addiction, and could not decide which track is my favorite. Standing Ovation is my favorite of her four albums. I like this CD so much that I would like to share with my friends and family. I already bought 5 copies, and I think I need 5 more for the holidays.

It takes bit of time to get the whole picture, but you never feel that he is not going to tell the tale.  I would give it 5 stars in a second except that it is just such a very grim tale. At the end we get a fairly positive resolution, but we take a beating getting there.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Maybe its because I too had a boyfriend with cancer that I related to this book in a way which kept me turning page after page. What a heartbreaking, inspiring, hilarious, and smart read this was. Loved loved loved the characters and everything about it.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I picked up this book with no expectations.<br />I like J.K. Rowlings voice and I wanted to read what she had to offer to the non-Potter audience and I wasn't disappointed.<br />Her honest account of a divided community full of varied characters pulls you into a sad world that twists and turns through hope and ambition, disgust and derision. Her account of authenticity leaving an indelible mark on the reader throughout the story.<br />Not for the faint of heart, this story is vivid in its description of depravity as well as despondency but with a dose of the plain realities of daily struggle mixed in.<br />Not completely dark there are moments of triumph and exhilaration but if you are expecting a happy jaunt through a meadow of wild flowers on a sunny day in May this might not be the book for you.<br />I found it to be a very good read.

B005JVNRA0|5.0|I love this movie, it always makes me laugh. I've probably seen it 30 times and never get tired of it. If anyone has ever worked for a boss they couldn't stand, it definitely is a funny twist on the relationship. I think the casting for this was absolutely brilliant and showed some different sides from actors you have not seen before. Jennifer Aniston played a great role. Highly recommended for a movie you want to buy and have in your collection.

B004Z2TUGE|1.0|Premise: Seemed interesting. Movie started strong.<br />Special FX: Decent.<br /><br />Then it started...<br /><br />Script: Horrible. Abysmal.<br />Editing: What editing? Painfully long, tedious moments of nothing significant followed by equally long moments of something else.  Oh, here's some guys with scary teeth.<br />Plot: The poster had more depth and story arc.<br />Characters: Also flatter than the poster. Cliches strung on wet noodle. \\"Oh, you're a photographer who doesn't like to be the center of attention? You're more comfortable behind the camera? Look, you're hiding behind your hands. What could that mean?  You're so deep and fragile. I love you.\\"  And \\"Hey, what's this weird blue light shooting out of my hands? Oh, look. I can run faster now. But this isn't fair and it makes me unhappy. I'll run some more.\\"  Run, Forest [waterfall], run.  Insert more scary teeth guys.<br /><br />This is a complete stinker obviously hoping to pull some Twilight backwash.  What a waste of 54 minutes (ya didn't think I'd actually sit through 2 hours of that; come on!).
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Ms. Boyle's CD seems to sound better and richer with each replaying.  In my opinion, \\"Standing Ovation\\" is her best CD to date.  I can hear an extremely subtle tone of confidence in her voice, as if by singing each of these songs, she knows she has reached her zenith.<br /><br />TIP: For some reason, the mp3 previews just do not do the complete tracks ANY kind of justice.  If you listen to preview tracks, know that should you purchase a track or the entire CD, you will be pleasantly and enormously rewarded.<br /><br />Each song seems to be a musical triumph for Susan Boyle's immense talent.  But we also get to enjoy the Royal Philharmonic, Donny Osmand, and Michael Crawford.  Susan's voice caresses each word with her almost unbelievable ability to allow us to HEAR and FEEL it.<br /><br />Is there any music Susan Boyle cannot sing?  [Well, perhaps arias from operas.]<br /><br />I have no favorite track on this CD.  They are ALL favorites.<br /><br />Each year now, I look forward to Fall and a new CD from Susan Boyle.  This is the perfect gift for those you love.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I have had a couple of these headphones.  Each time they have worked flawlessly.  Sound is good, very lightweight and comfortable on the ears.  I have had many in-ear type headphones.  I have always been challenged to get them seated properly seated in my ear and if they are not falling out they are uncomfortable after wearing them for a while.  I often find myself taking them out just to give my ear a rest.  I highly recommend if you are looking for simplicity, price and good sound.

B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Drive is possibly the most unexpected film debut of 2011, directed by Nicholas Winding Refm. Drive is unique in its craft for it contains the trill and drama of an action motion picture, but with a more stylish, atmospheric, and overall artistic approach. Loosely based on a 1978 car chase film, The Driver, and an adapted storyline from a book by the same name, Drive is a crime drama set in present day, with a stylistic 80s themed atmosphere and an affinity toward space.<br />This is Ryan Gosling's first role in an action oriented motion picture, which is surprising considering how well he embodies the main character. The Driver is less of a real human in the film and a more ominous fictional superhero character. His acting compliments the ambience of the film, he speaks little and with his silence decorates the developing plot by providing a tension. Lack of dialog and periods of silence may not seem like effective methods of conveying a story, on the contrary, the film thrives on these methods to develop the characters and story while also implying the dreamlike aesthetic.<br /> The atmosphere of Drive provides a unique spacious, illusionary world - a world rarely conveyed in today's action films. Scenes in LA are shot using wide views with vivid colors. The outdoor scenes of the city contribute to the retro feel. Most importantly, the music is made up of 80s inspired electronic pop music.<br />If you are interested in watching a Fast and the Furious or James Bond type action film, you may be disappointed. Drive is filled with action, car chases, a love story, but removes itself from the passé formulas of typical action/crime dramas - which, in turn, is replaced with a unique, trancelike appearance that heightens the story. However these qualities may not be as easily digested by most typical action movie fans.
B004SBX112|5.0|I love these games. They are addicting. I was getting annoyed with the ads always poping in (on the free game. Paying for the ad-free game is much better. And you don't lose your 'already completed' games. LOVE IT!
B0068FYZIO|4.0|For some people that would see this movie they might think that it doesn't really portray the way the Holocaust really was during World War II my opinion is that if it wasn't it still was a great movie to watch and actually it was my first time viewing it. This movie was one of Steven Spielberg's greatest masterpieces. Schindler's list which lasted all of three hours is factly based on the Holocaust nightmare that took place during Hitler''s reign in World war II. The movie is based on Oskar Schindler (a German buisinessman who takes the opportunity to make money off the Nazis' rise to power). It starts by someone's hand lighting a pair of candles. This movie was basically in black and white although this scene offered a small amount of color to it. Our first view of Schlindler is in a hotel room at first you don't know it's him but his jewels are shown and a large wad of money in which he puts on and in his pocket. As the movie progresses Schindler visits the Jewish council to carry out Nazis orders. as he walks in front of Jews he meets his accountant Itzhak Stern and tells him that he needs Jews (he called them investors)to help him purchase a factory. He doesn't want to pay the Jews with money as he convinces them to accept goods because he tells them that money will be no good in the ghetto. The factory gets set up by Schindler with the help of Stern and they commence to hire Jews because they are cheap labor. These jobs would help Jews from being in death camps and Stern knew this because he was trying to survive also.<br /><br />Meanwhile in 1942 Jews were assigned to the Plaszow labor camp which was controlled by Amon Goeth (a Nazi who was an alcholic and treachorous person) who killed prisoners quite often. The destruction has started and Schindler recognized it when he and his girlfriend view a little girl in a red coat (another color scene in the movie)walking thru. Schindler begins to feel sorry for the Jews and eventually lures Goeth to allow him to build his own camp to house his Jewish workers.<br /><br />Schindler begins to think about saving Jews after a girl named Regina begs him to hire her parents because she has heard that the factory was a pleasent place to work. A little later in the movie Goeth is charged with evacuating Plaszow and exhuming and burning of some 10,000 bodies of Jews that were killed in the ghetto. Schindler realizing that his workers and Stern would be facing death decided to spend his money to attempt to save as many Jews as possible. He eventually would persuade Goeth to sell him his workers and also his maid. He would have to buy the women workers twice because rather them being transported together they were split up from the men and were taken elsewhere. They would be reunited and remain in Czechaslovakia until World War II ended. At this point as Germany has fallen, Schindler also has lost his fortune but he saved over 1,100 Jewish lives from what we call the Holocaust.<br /><br />This movie relates to World Religions in the fact that it is based on the horrendous Holocaust. Schindler's List exposed many to the fact of the suffering and deaths of Jewish women, men, and children. After World War I Adolf Hitler put the blame on the Jews for Germany's problems. Religion played it's part because many Jews died but their beliefs were not in vain.

B002ZG99G8|3.0|The losers is a fairly good film. There is plenty of action and humor. Its a movie that can always make me laugh, the dialog between the characters is priceless at times. However with that said i often found myself expecting more than the film gave. I would often think there has to be more in terms of setting, plot, and characters/personalities. It might have just been me but i for some reason always felt something in the film was missing but never could really put my finger on what exactly. Other than that the film will make you laugh and give you action worth the time.<br /><br />Overall The Losers is a comical action packed thrill ride that is enjoyable to watch, 3 out of 5 stars.

B00170DEM8|5.0|I first saw Holiday Inn in the late sixties and loved it. I watch it at least once a year especially around the holidays. Fred Astaire is amazing! People talk about Michael Jackson's dancing, but Fred Astaire is the best I have ever seen.His dancing and Bing Crosby's voice are an awesome combination.<br />  The plot is so cool too. Today's movie's cannot compete with movie's like Holiday Inn. It not only has great song and dance, but it is very funny too.<br />I would rather watch this, than any other holiday movie.<br />This is truly a classic!

There's alot of great tunes on this that all their fans will like.
B00973DDN2|5.0|The sound of The Killers continues to evolve on each album while the voice of Brandon Flowers has a unique familiarity that keeps the band rooted in familiar territory, which is actually a very pleasing thing to fans of the group. If you're looking for something like Hot Fuss, you won't find it in Battle Born. However, you will find strong ballads with heartfelt lyrics as well as that synth/rock/pop sound that only The Killers can pull off. The albums isn't perfect, but it deserves no less than five stars. If you like The Killers for more than their debut album, then you will love Battle Born.

B009A9EPLM|5.0|Sounding almost as if Williams is channeling Aaron Copland, this is one of the composer's more surprising and subdued works. I cannot say how appropriate it is to the story since I haven't seen the film yet but it certainly makes me more eager to do so. It treats the subject with appropriate respect and gravity without the typical bombast and layers of blasting brass that I associate with Williams's work, particularly when he writes for Spielberg.<br /><br />Most of the tracks are somber and meditative, and when they lift above that solemn mode it is because the material seems to call for it. The track containing \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\" is astonishing in the way it seems to capture the mood of a time when both sides of the conflict still believed there was something glorious about their cause. What is most appealing, for this listener at least, is the way in which the recorded score coheres as a complete work. Again, the experience is reminiscent of listening to Copland; I like simply putting the disk on and letting it play straight through as I would with a symphony.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Williams's work, this is a must-have. I'm sure the film will create more interest in his other scores, however this is one of the rare instances when the score may have a life of its own beyond the film (much as Howard Shore's scores for the Tolkien films do--and will).<br /><br />This music owes much, also, to the scores of the Burns documentaries, in particular the piano stylings of Jacqueline Schwab. It would have been nice to see some acknowledgment of that fact in the liner notes but perhaps those musical treatments have become so much a part of our culture that Williams adapts them without realizing it. Overall, this is a worthwhile purchase and repays repeated listenings as few other Williams scores do.

1451696191|4.0|I thought that this book connects to teenagers on a larger and more personal level then any other book that I have read. It is so relatable to what teenagers during this day and age go through. From struggles and issues such as drug abuse, homosexuality, teen pregnancy, rape, and even just the coming of age, this book covers it all from the perspective of a sixteen-year-old boy, Charlie, who has little experience as an adult yet. When Charlie's best friend Michael commits suicide, Charlie begins writing a journal, which is how this book is formatted. One of my favorite things about this book is how this diary format gives you a look at exactly what Charlie was feeling and thinking, no matter how personal it was. This format gives a refreshing view to reading a new book and tells stories of Charlie's life through his own perspective. This format also keeps you wondering on who he is actually writing these letters too because it is never stated in the book, he is simply telling his life to a complete stranger, or no one at all. Another one of my favorite aspects of this book was how relatable and realistic it was. There were no major plot twists or unreasonable problems that arose throughout the book, which also made it a refreshing read, very different from most books. My favorite aspect of this book though was the fact that throughout it you get a feel of the kind of person Charlie is not only through his stories but also through the music he expressed he loved. Throughout the book he makes multiple play lists for his friends that they listen to together. The fact that this book includes real songs can give you a whole new relationship to the characters and the book itself when you listen to the songs that the characters were supposed to be listening to in different scenes. Once I looked up all the songs that were in the book and listened to them, they gave me even stronger feelings to be able to relate to Charlie and emotionally feel through the music the type of person he is supposed to be. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to all teenagers and young adults, it is an easy and quick read but also leaves a lasting impression. It is also 100% relatable to many issues many people also struggle with daily in their adolescent years and gives you realistic scenarios and relationships that any person, especially a teenager, would be able to connect to.
0316212377|3.0|HS is ultimately disappointing.  By now the series is losing the magic that brought me to the Culture.  This probably started happened when the books started printing the author's name in a font 10X larger than the title, and proclaiming/branding on each one \\"A Culture Novel.\\"<br /><br />If you like the Culture stories already, this is a good read, and is full of the techy toys like 'knife missles' and plotting that make the series engaging.  In this one, those of us who are interested get to hear more about Subliming.  It all becomes increasingly self-referential, like the Deep Space Nine series of Star Trek.<br /><br />The plot holes are hard to miss, for example the entire question as to why the Gzilt ship takes such a hard line with the ZR ship at the beginning of the novel.  The entire Scavenger subplot as to who will get the Gzilt's gilt doesn't make sense as important to the main story.  The entire premise of killing the Gzilt president doesn't make sense, either--why wasn't she 'backed up' and available soon after her death?  The conceit of the name of the book doesn't really figure into the story at all except to neatly bookend the beginning and conclusion.  The nominal antagonist of a powerful older man who likes to take advantage of younger subordinates is the same type of villain from the prior novel and a sign of creative exhaustion.<br /><br />You should read HS if you are keen on the Culture, as I am, and its vision of a humane, if not human, and optimistic future.  But also be prepared to be less than satisfied with the holes in the road, and just try to sit back and enjoy the Displacement.
B005CWRB44|4.0|The design of the switching could be better. The same threads that open up the light are used to turn it on/off. I.e., you're effectively taking it partially apart to turn the light off.  Twist too far and it opens up.  Also, to change brightness, you have to twist multiple times within a half second or so. Its just odd and non-intuitive. I prefer a better switch design.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|First off, there is nothing that compares to the live production, sounds, depth, smells and that incredible sense of community, however, this release was terrific, and on a large widescreen (as well as the sensationl camerawork) I felt as if I had a special box (Box 5!) that cast me right there on-stage.<br /><br />I saw this production, maybe twelve years ago at the Murat here in Indy along with a young lady for whom I had even gotten the requisite rose (it helps to know the play you're going to see) and I still remember the pageantry and spectacle that is The Phantom of the Opera. I still have my playbill and the nifty color album that came with it.<br /><br />When I was in junior high school (a little bit back in time) I saw the 1925 silent version with legendary Lon Chaney Sr. and dressed up as the Phantom that Halloween. I have all of the primary versions that followed (1943 with Claude Rains, 1962 with Herbert Lom, 1983 with Maximilian Schell and Jane Seymour, 1989 with Robert Englund and Jill Schoelen, 1998 with Julian Sands and Asia Argento and 2004 with Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum, which was the movie based off of this play).<br /><br />The cinematography is more than an equal to the choreography not only on this DVD but also on this 2011 production, and, of course, since this is a stage play in a beautiful auditorium the lighting and harmonics are clarion fantastique. As I've already said, this was awesome to watch.<br /><br />Ramin Karimloo's Phantom was painful to behold, and that was a great thing; his voice resonated from my TV, making me want to look around and see if he were sitting next to me. Not since the last Alice Cooper concert DVD have I felt as if I were right there enjoying the live performance. Universal did good!<br /><br />Sierra Boggess's beauty rivals that fabulous voice of hers; her rendition of Christine was spot-on and even this burly guy was brought to tears (got something in my eye, dangit!) as she wept her farewell to the Phantom.<br /><br />Lovely, phenomenal and cool beans, says me, just wow!

B001M5UDGS|4.0|Joss Whedon's Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog challenges the traditional views of good versus evil. The movie includes fine acting, catchy, well- written songs, and a witty yet humorous dialogue that makes it enjoyable to watch. It consists of a thought out exchange of ideas with sarcasm and incorporates a secret romance that helps maintain a certain charm throughout the film.<br /><br />Dr. Horrible is an assumed evil villain caught up in world domination. He brags about his adventures through his Internet blog and hopes to win admission into the Evil League of Evil. He plans to steal materials needed for his secret weapon and attempt to kill his archenemy, Captain Hammer. Inside however, Dr. Horrible is a sweet romantic who has fallen in love with an innocent, naïve girl named Penny. Captain Hammer, on the other hand, is a self-centered human being who uses his hero title to get women.<br /><br />Dr. Horrible is aware the League observes his every move, so he performs to his most wicked ability. He tries to steal the wonderflonium needed for his freeze ray, but looses control of the van. Right as the van is about to collide with Penny, Captain Hammer appears and pushes her out of the way. As a result, Dr. Horrible introduces his most hated foe to his dream girl.<br /><br />The \\"evil\\" Dr. Horrible's apparel includes an all white coat and gloves. The color white tends to symbolize innocence and righteousness. Conversely, the \\"hero\\" Captain Hammer's attire consists of dark colored clothes, which typical are worn by the immoral and guilty. Half way through the film, Penny has a conversation with Billy. She comments on Captain Hammer's demeanor by saying, \\"Some people are layered like that. There's something totally different underneath that's what on the surface.\\" Penny's statement ironically describes Billy too because he is a complex character who appears pleasant towards Penny, but is destructive on the inside.<br /><br />As the movie reaches its closing stages, Penny gets stabbed with flying shards of metal thanks to Captain Hammer's egocentric doing. As Penny takes her last breath, she says to Dr. Horrible, \\"Captain Hammer will save us.\\" Her dying words are important because Captain Hammer was the one who actually killed her. At the end, Dr. Horrible's true nature is revealed when he joins the Evil League of Evil. He transforms from his white ensemble into a dark, red suit and black gloves. This change signifies his transformation from good to evil. Dr. Horrible ultimately achieves his goal of supreme power, but does not get the girl of his dreams. The quality of acting in this short movie is rather good compared to other movies that have this specific genre and disposition. The fusion of quirky humor, irony, and memorable songs make this movie worth while to watch numerous times.
B009LL4LMM|3.0|Not the worst app I ever had, but it is far from best.  Comparing this to Angry Birds is a massive leap.  Not even close as good as that franchise.  Graphics are good, but play is not great game play.  Worth a try but I will not keep it.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I found bad piggies not to be user friendly and have removed the app. Couldn't figure out what the procedure or point was.  Disappointing, as I have liked the other games.
B007K8ILTW|5.0|The restoration is amazing - almost worth watching just for this reason alone. Of course the reason to watch this is if you strongly like Stanley Kubrick's work. Otherwise you'll likely take notice to its low-budget and mostly average performances too much. It's fun to watch if you're interested, like I was, to see a filmmaker just getting started, developing his style, with strong hints of what would come from him later. The scene between the soldier and the young woman taken prisoner is probably the highlight of the film. The violent sequences are simple but effective; the shot selection and editing is what makes it work. I give it 5 stars mainly because it was good to finally see Kubrick's first film, one that I thought would never be available on DVD. Kubrick dismissed this film, I can see why. He couldn't get over its flaws but, somehow, I think he'd be OK with people seeing this film now, knowing that the viewers appreciate the mark he left in filmmaking.
B003E2UQMS|5.0|I began this book because I seen that it was been made into a movie!! When I began reading it it dawned on me that pat was irritating me and I was gonna stop reading it but something made me want to read more.  The story is intriguing and after you get over pat and his ways i ended up routing for pat to get over nikki and begin his life.  At times I felt lime crying and then laughing out loud at the things he and his friends got up to. Overall its an excellent book and really well written I am really pleased I read it and can't wait to see the movie!!!
B00000DHRX|5.0|I chose this rating because I recieved this productin a short amount of time for a small amount of time, I have no conplaints.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I would've given it 5 stars if it was a little longer! I have always enjoyed Stephen King, definitely kept me going.
030758836X|3.0|It was just okay and had a lot of potential and then it just died at the end.  Nothing was resolved, its like the author didn't know how to end it, so she just didn't.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Riveting, page turner...I read it in three days. It really struck home how this family could be yours or mine...
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Diana Krall has long been an underrated jazz singer and pianist. On her latest CD she has changed her repertoire but none of her ability to project a song. The material is all new - none of the traditional standards - and without exception of very high quality. Most of the songs project a lonely mood, or express the feeling of loss after the break up of a relationship. The orchestral backing is discreet and gives Diana's talent full scope.  The rather raunchy image presented by the CD's title and the cover art, is not reflected in the music or the performance. Fortunately, I add. Because this is a great album - near to Diana's best.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Amazing !!!! I love friends, and despite the fact that these are not extended episodes, unlike DVD version, Blue Ray picture quality is stunning !!! I love the packing as well, so friends like !!! A must have product for any FRIENDS fan, highly recommend !!!
B009682EFQ|5.0|..I thought I would write up a quick review for this album as there are currently only three reviews and two of them are negative.. one complaining about the packaging and one person who bought the wrong album???  Let it be known that this is quite possibly Neurosis' best work yet.. 5 stars..

0786956291|5.0|A few friends and I decided that we wanted to start a tabletop gaming group and felt that DnD would be a great place to start. After asking a few of our older friends that grew up playing the game, we were informed that the red box would be a good place to start. We looked at a few different gaming shops found that it would be cheaper to buy it online. I ordered it from Bellwether books in a like new condition and received it two days before its earliest arrival date, completely new. The books are pretty detailed and the cards and pieces were great additions. There were only five character sheets, but you can go to the website and print out more easily. We are all really happy about the quality of the product and are looking forward to playing it quite a bit.
B008C1O8CA|3.0|good album, not great. not a big fan of the earlier stuff which this album has been compared to. more of a fan of &#34;american idiot&#34;, and &#34;21st century&#34; some real good songs but, not enough. still, i listened to this record for two straight weeks, as it grew on me, and i'll be purchasing &#34;dos&#34;, and &#34;tre&#34;.
B002J8LVO0|5.0|I used to have this casette tape when I was a teen & listening to it again really brings back memories. This is some of U2's best music. If you like 80's music & U2 this is a must have. This product shipped on time & in good condition.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is fun but you do have to pace yourself. Be careful with your diamonds if you don't want to purchase more. It has great graphics. You have to be patient to unlock rooms so if you can do that then this game is for you.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I bought this Disney movie to add to our daughters collection of Tinkerbell movies. This one did not disapoint. Great animation & music to go with the tale that keeps my daughter asking to watch it over & over. This product was shipped on time & in good condition.
1416511946|4.0|First, I have never tried heroin. I was offered it once as a teenager and turned it down flat. I come from a family who has many members who have succumbed to various alcohol and drug addictions. I have lost family members to alcohol, cocaine, heroin, and others. I personally chose not to go down this road. I read this book attempting to possibly gain more insight into my loved ones who did use IV drugs. I got a bit of a better idea. More on me later most of you want a book review.<br /><br /> The Heroin Diaries on one hand are very telling stories about drug addiction. Telling us about being strung out and vomiting and having diarrhea at the same time should not come across as glamorous to anyone. On the other hand I would have liked to have seen him really spell out his unique situation a little more. Yes, he actually died and was brought back to life twice. Yes, he did have multiple relapses and talks about how he had to deal with his personal emotional demons before he could STAY Straight. But one of the things he mentions (but not in as much detail as I would like to have seen) is how his rock stardom, and subsequent million dollar finances allowed him to do this. Nikki didn't have to physically steal from his family and friends to get his drugs. He burned through a million dollars in drugs (mostly heroin and cocaine) in one year. I would have loved one entry that stated, \\"If I wasn't an international rock star I would have lived on the street and stolen from everyone around me. I probably would have ended up dead long before my two failed attempts. I had so many people looking after me I didn't have to be responsible at all. They enabled me, and I had the money to do it. If you think this is glamorous, just think, instead of having the ability to spend a million dollars on drugs in one year, you'll burn every friend and family member you ever once loved. They will never trust you until your clean, and you will end up on the streets soaked in your own urine shooting drugs without anyone at your side dying and wishing you were dead.\\" He did do a little of this with his stories concerning Ratt guitarist Robin Crosby. Robin lost his battle with heroin. Robin got AIDS from sharing needles with vagabond street junkies, and died homeless and broke. From being a millionaire with platinum records to dying homeless without shoes on the streets of Los Angelas. Those are the stories I would have love a little more of. Not all together Nikki's fault. He found a way through the heroin death trap. Many do not. My adopted father lost his brother to heroin that way. I got to watch my dad cry like a baby. I give Nikki a lot of credit for putting this in print to begin with. However, because some of the drug stories are in turn associated with the band \\"Motley Crue\\" I feel drug use was occasionally glamorized in the \\"rock Star\\" persona. I do feel he did a good job of showing the lonely aspect of drugs, the lying, the nights by yourself, the paranoia. All in all he did a good job.<br /><br /> Last but not least I want to tell you about those who don't use drugs, alcohol, or have other addictions but are hurt by them. The little girl who's mother had an addiction and kept getting them evicted from every home they ever had. The anger that stems from that is great, and that little girl grew up to be a nurse but had to work to overcome her childhood. The little boy who watched his mother falling asleep drunk in a bowl of cheerios everyday when he came home from school. He saw the needle fall out of his uncles pocket with a spoon, and didn't understand why his brother had all those \\"cigarette burns\\" on his arms that were irregularly shaped (you know track marks). That little boy also grew up, became a nurse, and married the the little girl above. They both chose to go on a different path than the examples they saw growing up. But what they didn't quite understand, and that which would take them years to understand is the impact it had on them. One became angry and had to deal with those issues for years because of her childhood. The other learned to ignore everything as if it didn't exist. Imagine being a nurse a year out of school and getting your first heroin addict. Charge nurse tells you, \\"Typical infected abscess from injecting.\\" You go in and introduce yourself, and you leave the room like, \\"What, typical what, that guy is just a normal dude.\\" My coworkers looked at me like I was out of my mind. I had completely shut off seeing addiction in any form as a defense mechanism. Drug addicts around the home were normal when I was growing up. My uncles friend was a chiropractor before he lost his license and family to cocaine addiction. Last I heard, he lost his two new children (because his first wife divorced him and took his first child) he had with his new girlfriend (a heroin addict) because the kids came out addicted. Though he (the former chiropractor) is working at a pawn shop for minimum wage, living in a slum, and trying to avoid the dealers he owed money to. How glamorous is that?<br /><br /> Unless your a rock star with a million dollars to spend on smack and blow you'll end up dead and it won't be glamorous.ne became angry and had to deal with those issues for years because of her childhood.

B008BRC6NS|4.0|As the title suggests, this is a dance collection. To stay relevant and current, JLo has enlisted Lady Gaga's producer RedOne who did the previous Ibiza/Latin themed On The Floor.<br /><br />Dance Again is highly fun and infectious, I've been playing this several times a day. The set also contains another new song Goin' In.<br /><br />The deluxe CD features 16 songs - mostly her best known hits like Love Don't Cost A Thing, If You Had My Love, Waiting For Tonight, Jenny From The Block and Get Right. Hits from under performing albums such as Brave (Do It Well) and Love? (I'm Into You) are represented as well.<br /><br />I'm Real and Ain't It Funny are the murder mixes. The original JLo versions are left off as are Play and I'm Gonna Be Alright.<br /><br />The three extra tracks All I Have, Que Hiciste and Let's Get Loud are nice additions and make the standard edition look rather austere.<br /><br />The booklet is very well designed with pictures taken from all of JLo's previous albums. The cover, back of booklet and back cover shots are from the video Dance Again. Budget constraints?<br /><br />With only 11 videos, The DVD is at best a bonus disc and not an anthology.<br /><br />Dance Again features a tamer than tame made for Disney orgy. It looks like a human jigsaw puzzle put together. Even the bondage gear are more fashionable than kinky. I think JLo does not want her children to go: \\"OMG, what is Mommy doing?\\"  No wonder this received only a PG rating in my conservative country. Compare this to Christina Aguilera's Not Myself Tonight and Kylie Minogue's All The Lovers and you'll know what I mean. Nonetheless, it's still an enjoyable video.<br /><br />This version of Jenny From The Block excludes the rappers, who are featured in The Reel Me version.<br /><br />The beginning part of Get Right had Jennifer playing different people. It's rather idiotic as the dialogue does not make any sense.<br /><br />Both the CD and DVD are clean versions. So the vulgarities arebeeped out in I'm Real.<br /><br />It is interesting to note the discerning buying patterns of the American public. There are a million downloads for the song Dance Again, making it platinum. As for the album, it fell off the charts quickly despite peaking in the top 20.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|Hands down this movie is one of my favorites. I just wanted to see it again.<br />However, the amazon's streaming video quality was quite poor. And considering the great film it was quite frustrating experience watching in poor quality that I had to pay for.<br /><br />Amazon have began growing on me like being very sneaky with their services.<br /><br />You pay for something that is never what they are promising you.<br />The same with their prime membership. They say there are tons of free movies and shows, but good lick finding them.<br /><br />Guess what there is no such category as free TV shows or Movies.<br /><br />Kind of lame of Amazon.
B000J103N4|5.0|I've wore out two of these albums but just recently purchased the new CD. It is of course a pretty mellow album...but the musianship and the material are so well done that the songs just seem to be part of my DNA anymore. Cowboy Movie is the song that if I did Karaoke....and it was ever available and if I could actually sing...well.....that would be a cool song to do. If you like any of the Crosby, Stills Nash Young albums do your self a favor and get this one. Then roll a fatty...not that you'll really need to....and just let it play....it's timeless.

B009VSW15Y|5.0|I have not so far used the camera too much as my Kindle Fire HD is new.  But the uses I have made of it are great and I am very satisfied with the results.
B006LSZECO|4.0|GONE GIRL, an engrossing, entertaining, and quick read takes the reader on a fun ride of twists and turns. A very well crafted novel tightly wound with a look into the world of Borderline Personality disorder and it's full range of  manifestations. First time I read this author but will be checking out his other work. Buy it if you want a fun, psychological mystery that's not too heavy. This would be an excellent film, by the way.
B009VLXMJA|4.0|Aren't as many awesome songs on this album when compared with Fearless or Speak Now, but still a quality album.  I would recommend this album, definitely!  My favorite songs on the album are: (Red, All To Well, I Almost Do, Starlight and Begin Again).  A nice juxtaposition between country and rock in these.
B002RI9PKO|5.0|I love this book, plain and simple. I read this book once already borrowing from friend. But I could not stop myself from getting one for myself. The book help me refocus on the meaning of my life and what and how I can do to help me achieve it. Love it and would recommend anyone to read it.

B000FBFN1U|3.0|Clearly Martin is a major talent with a rare ability to create rich worlds, and I give Game of Thrones 4 stars, but books 2 and 3 should have been edited down about fifty percent and then combined into a single sequel. There is just way too much downtime.<br /><br />There are compelling stories and vibrant characters here (Tyrion, Arya, Jaime), but Martin gets bogged down in page after page of endless inner monologue, rehashing of the past, and chapters where nothing happens. Do we even need the Bran POV anymore, for instance? And the catchphrases are overdone. I get it, the Lannisters pay their debts and Jon Snow knows nothing, it was cute the first five times but by the tenth it is just painful.<br /><br />This series could have been truly great, but Martin fails to keep the plot as fiery as book one's.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the game. Getting used to the smaller graphics. I like hidden objects games. The expanding screen helps. Have fun playing.

1439152802|4.0|The Secret Keeper is a book of secrets and mysteries. A spellbinding story is woven around actress Laurel, and her siblings, uncomfortably dealing with their beloved mother's final days. Dorothy, the matriarch, is shown in her past story, mostly set in London during the blitz (WWII.) The pattern becomes set, in Morton's writing, of weaving back and forth between the 40s, the 60s and the present (2011).<br /><br />Some of Morton's writing seems transparent to me, in that I can see what is coming...although this doesn't negate the readability and enjoyability factor. Each step of the way, Morton scatters crumbs of the secrets, like Hansel and Gretel marking the return path. It is up to the reader to follow the path and figure out the clues.<br /><br />In the 1940s mode, we see the immature, flibbertigibbet Dorothy, working as a companion for a crotchety, irascible old lady; a WEALTHY old lady. Dorothy lives vicariously through the exotic Vivien, who lives across the street from the old lady. This beautiful, rich, and enigmatic woman enchants the poor, greedy Dorothy. Dorothy creates an alternate world for herself, where she is friends with the rich, and a possible heiress. Her life is lived through daydreams and far-fetched wishes.<br /><br />In segues to the 1960s, Dorothy has changed. A lot. A loving mother and wife, she is content in the family farmhouse, raising her brood, truly enamored of her husband, and a fun-loving, compassionate woman. What happened between the 40s and the 60s to change her so much?<br /><br />The mystery pivots around an event in the 1960s that daughter Laurel has suppressed for years. She saw something bizarre and inexplicable from the treehouse fort, hidden high in a tree. That occurrence involved her Mother, her baby brother and an unknown stranger--a man who showed up at the farmhouse during a birthday party. Sixteen-year-old Laurel had to talk to the police, and explain what she saw...but her Mother would never discuss it thereafter, and it faded from memory over time--until 2011.<br /><br />Dorothy is dying. Is she senile, or suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's? Or is there something she is trying to confide in Laurel? The trunks in the attic have cryptic clues, scraps of paper and pictures that Laurel and her siblings don't understand. Dorothy tries to explain, in periods of clarity, but it is up to Laurel to find out what it all means, and put it together. She needs to give her mother peace in her last days.<br /><br />This search takes her to London, to old friends of Dorothy's that are still living, to locales that Dorothy frequented and to the back story of Dorothy's life. Why did Dorothy change so much from who she was in 1938-1941 to the woman she became in the 1960s? What events or traumas happened in her life that led to the tragic confrontation with the unknown man who crashed the birthday party?<br /><br />The adult children bring their mother home from her nursing facility to die at home, in her beloved farmhouse. Being there seems to trigger more subliminal memories, and brings more frustration and discomfort to Dorothy. Laurel must find out, and fast, what the past brought to the present, so her mother, and indeed, all of them, can rest in peace. The book's denouement was excellent, all the threads gathered and intelligently, albeit emotionally, divulged. I felt that the book was a bit longer than it needed to be; 100 pages could have been trimmed without ruining the plot or the finale--but it was highly interesting to read about both the 40s and the 60s when life seemed simpler, and the pace slower and less intense. Family secrets appeal to most of us, who have our own family dynamics to work through and remember.<br /><br />by Laura Strathman Hulka<br />for Story Circle Book Reviews<br />reviewing books by, for, and about womennd it faded from memory over time--until 2011.<br /><br />Dorothy is dying.

B000VDDDY6|1.0|Are you kidding me? The people who have given this junk 4 and 5 star reviews are obviously not fans of the original Star Trek series.<br />I assumed 'remastered' meant picture restoration. All of the original special effects, which are integral and gives the series its charm, are gone, deleted, and replaced with awful CGI, even the original title music has been erased and replaced with a newly recorded version. I don't want this; I want the original Star Trek series. I consider this to be vandalism, a desecration, and the philistines who did it talk about wanting to 'respect' the original material, they have had the audacity to change and alter the entire series, just because they think it should look like this, I find this offensive. Why not erase William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy and CGI in better looking, modern actors while you're at it?<br /><br />I cannot find any menu, on the DVDs, that allows me to see the original, untampered with, episodes - I have been informed that the original special effects are not included on the DVDs, Blu-ray edition only do you have a choice.<br /><br />This is not \\"The original series\\" it is a butchered, bastardised farce.  I will be returning this junk and asking for my money back.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Prometheus is actually a prequel to \\"Alien\\" no matter how they play it. Ridley did a great job and I understand a lot of questions are answered in the Blu-Ray Disc. This is not Planet 426 (Alien) but seems almost the same. Silica storms, alien ships, chest bursting.<br /><br />I would recommend this to any fan of the \\"Alien\\" series, although you can see this without ever seeing an \\"Alien\\" film and still understand the film. Ridley Scott did a great job on making this film since it's been so long since he's done a sc-fi/horror film.<br /><br />He says he planned on doing a sequel to Prometheus, however long that may be is unsure since he recently lost his brother to suicide and he's getting up there in age. It's tragic that he lost his brother and I wish him the best.<br /><br />If you want to buy this set, get the Blu-Ray 3D/2D, DVD, wi-fi disc. It's been as low as $20.00 this past week. The only lousy thing about this set is that the 16 page book included in the set is lifted word from word from the \\"Prometheus\\" hardback book on the film that was released earlier this year. (And if you can still get that book, it's great and Ridley said it would be the only book done for the movie (unlike the Alien films).<br /><br />Enjoy the film you \\"Alien\\" fans and hope for a \\"Prometheus\\" sequel soon to answer the questions Ridley asked.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|This set and all the individual blu rays are fully restored versions of the movies.  They look close to what they originally did in theatres in many regards. The series itself features some classic sci fi momments and a few lesser flicks. ALien 3 for instance was always a dark flick and was not a big success. The movie looked dark in the theatres too.  This set is worth owning and now these movies are out in individual packages. The series is one of the most popular in science fiction history so if you are a sci fi fan then this is a must for you. Each disk has plenty of extras too.
B004NYQYNQ|4.0|If you are going to listen to pop, you may as well listen to Adele.  She has an incredible voice as displayed on this album.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I was a little disconcerted when the first vignette ended, but I kept reading and all the stories are very engrossing.  In fact the reason I was initially disconcerted was that I didn't want that first story to end ...  And, once the thread of connection is made between the stories, characters, and ages, it becomes fascinating reading.  The author has done a masterful job of re-creating the time, place and language of the age: past, present and future.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|This album experiments with so many new sounds and does them masterfully.  Kayne West picks incredible features and telling a fantastic story.  Buy this!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor may not have the best voice ever heard, but she certainly sings her heart out, and the talent she has is amazing. Her songs are very well written, easy to remember and sing along to,and appeal to all age groups- case in point I am very 50+, and would NOT miss her concerts when she comes to town. Quite a performer, and this album will be another blockbuster for sure.

B001KWN6ZS|4.0|I have heard a lot of Eric Clapton fans hate this album but I found it quite enjoyable.  It's not mind shattering like some of his other work, but the unplugged series is one worth collecting.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|If your looking for the Complete Beatles theres a lot of things missing here.The Anthology Series is not here.Also,Let It Be(Naked),The Great BBC Seriers is also not included.The Love album is also not here.<br />The Beatles from 1962 to 1969 recorded a special Christmas 45 for paid up members of their fan club.In 1970 Apple put out an LP of all the 45s and sent it out to the fan club members.(Note,Beware,This LP has been pirated)A few CDs crept out a few years later to the public.Getting back to the Beatles Vinyl Box it should have been included as a Bonus Disc,but,alas,it is not.<br />In 1964 Capitol put out a few test pressings of the Beatles At The Hollywood Bowl,but was cancled.Years later,a poorly done Beatles At The Hollywood Bowl with the 64/65 concerts(Half of 64/65 was put out.)It should have been a two LP set,there were rumors of a set coming out,but never did.)There has never been an Lp or official CD of any complete Live Beatles Concert to date.At any rate,The Hollywood Bowl Concert is not here.<br />Another album is The Beatles Story.A US two record set of the boys at work and play in 1964.A rare Beatles Medley and a snippet of Live Material(WOW)Interviews mostly.But,again,its not here.<br />In 1964 MGM released The Beatles with Tony Sheridan(A Gene Vincent type rocker)recorded back in the Peter Best days.A nice Ventures style instrumental Cry For A Shadow was included,but sadly none of it is here.<br />Beware.This boxed set is far from being complete.
0452284392|3.0|These nonfiction books are often times very enlightening and entertaining for all 300 pages, other times they only manage to do this for about 100 pages.  This book fell into the latter category.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|The second installment of the Kingkiller Chronicle picks up immediately where the first book finished - wonderful!  There was no need to go backwards and get a summary or rehash of the first book.  This book picks up the pace and pulls you further into the story.  The tale develops nicely and does not race to jam in irrelevant characters or plot as many sequels do - it just subtly escalates the action and lures you in to wanting more.  The only thing is.... I need the next book asap to find out how it all continues.
030758836X|1.0|I did not like this book. In all my reviews I constantly say that I am not a professional reviewer so I do not ever say anything bad. If I don't like a book I usually do not give it a review but this one makes me shake my head. I cannot picture it as a movie. It has been on best seller list for months which automatically confirms that I am not a good reviewer. I do not recommend it. The only other book I ever read that I would not recommend was a James Patterson novel about robots.  In the past six months I have read over 50 books and this Gone Girl is just not my idea of relaxation or knowledge which is usually what I look for in a book. The language is horrible also.  What a waste of money.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|I've watched the movies several times and enjoyed them! The book did not disappoint and was more enjoyable than the movie
B009IAFEK4|5.0|This is a great book.  First of all, I love John Grisham novels and have either read or listened to all he has done. What I like about his books is the advantage of learning law procedure. Our courts are very strict and the judges are honorable, I like that. I never go into the characters or plot in my reviews because I do not feel I am qualified to judge people who do things I cannot do. All I can say is that this was a great book and I enjoyed it from beginning to end.  I highly recommend you read it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is a great read and holds your interest! It would be  an enjoyable series for adults and teenagers alike!
B004EPYZP8|2.0|I read the book first and liked it very much so ordered the movie to watch. The acting was not very good and there was so much more to the written version. Don't waste your money on movie.
1451695187|3.0|I loved the storyline of the book but did not like how I needed a master degree to understand about seventy percent of it.  I guess he was either over-educated or needed to write more so he added his scientific stuff into the book. When writing a book understand that not everyone knows the dictionary and I should not have to refer to it so that I understand what I am reading. Great storyline but a lot of unwanted information. Needs more information on his 7 days in heaven and the ending was bare but interesting.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead Season 3 is very exicting and filled with incredable sceans. Very entertaining and you will be sure to stay glued to your seat so you dont miss anything!

034552554X|5.0|As a young woman I had a friend who was a florist and I loved hanging out in her shop and gardens.  She loaned me a book on the victorian meaning of flowers.  I loved the sentimentality of the descriptions of each flower's \\"gift.\\"<br />I was really excited to see this book as a vine offering and can't believe I have waited so long to review it!<br />I loved the book's concept, execution and the author's writing, but mostly I just loved Victoria.  Regardless of her flaws and the wounds she carries from her soul destroying time in the foster care system, I \\"get\\" her.  I understand why some reviewers find her maddeningly frustrating and seemingly feckless and self-destructive.<br />This is one of those special books that you can really \\"enter into\\" and simply suspend reality and judgment of details and just BE the story.<br />I loved this book and hope to read more from this author.
B009FZFONO|5.0|love the walking dead.  we only have an antenna, no cable tv, dish, or u-verse stuff so we watch this series on Amazon.com.  It saves us a lot of money and we watch it whenever we want to.
B0031TZ8TU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I generally read fiction, but this is a true story that is exciting and well written.  I gained a lot of respect for Ross Perot.  He stood by his employees and rescued them from an impossible situation.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had to get the book to see what the fuss was about.  It isn't the best literature you'll ever read, but then again I guess it isn't meant to be.  I kept waiting for more of a story line but is really just crazy, outrageous sex scenes linked by a few other very predictable scenes thrown in.  Don't buy it, borrow if you want to read it, its not worth the money new.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great thriller, that made a 4 hour plane ride go by in 10 minutes.  You are gripped by page 10 and stay on the high until the end.<br /><br />Well Done!!!!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Being a SG fan, you know what they have done and how legendary BMF, SU, and DOTU were. Well, King Animal is just as great! \\"Been away too long\\" and \\"Non-State Actor\\" are being hyped as the singles, but the real meat is in all the rest of it, like \\"A thousand days before\\", \\"Blood on the valley floor\\", \\"By Crooked Steps\\", and Bones of Birds\\". I am so glad they got back together!
055357342X|5.0|cONTINUES THE GAME OF THRONES SAGA PLENTY OF PLOT TWISTS AND TURNS INCLUDING SEVERAL I DIDN'T EXPECT ALL AND ALL A VERY GOOD READ.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have read all of the Scarpetta series and this one was just o.k. for me.  It was not the page turner I was used to from Ms Cornwell - and it almost seemed like it was co-written by another author. The writing style seemed different from past books. Overall I liked it but not as good as the her past writings.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As with all John Grisham books it was well written and captivating.  The book progressed nicely and held the usual Grisham intrigue.  As usual I not only look forward to the next book but I always come away from a Grisham read with knowledge I previously did not have.  His research on subject matter is second to none.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is a film for everyone. Whatever you like in a film this has it. Oh! and the 3d effects were awsome.
B0085157B8|1.0|There is a great movie to be made about terror at a Water Park,<br />but this is surely not it.
B008S80OU2|5.0|Blue Oyster Cult, one of the most important bands in the North American hard-rock scene is giving to the fans the opportunity to buy at low cost a very interesting  collection of their discography.<br /><br />I knew both Original Sony-Columbia Album Classics Series also rendered to the band. However they lack essential works as Spectres, Extra Terrestrial Live and Imaginos.<br /><br />I consider this an opportunity to have all the complete Blue Öyster Cult's production, as would be expected for a true fan or someone who wants to know totally this excellent band.<br /><br />The arts and finish designs are generally very acceptable (facsimiles of the original prints).<br /><br />The inclusion of a basic 40-page booklet that show the content descriptions and review.<br /><br />An interesting video that shows the group live in a highlight of his career (Some Enchanted Evening).<br /><br />Two additional discs of rarities and radio broadcasts that are a real bonus material (also very well designed graphically) and fully enriches the content and allows us to go a little beyond the album production.<br /><br />The opportunity to download from the network (by an activation code) four excellent broadcasted live transmissions from 1980, 1981, 1983 and 1986.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent in all albums and very acceptable in some bonus tracks and bonus material.<br /><br />Definitely for those who like Blue Oyster Cult, this is the opportunity to acquire their material in a completely definitive and economic product. A recommended item for the true fan, and in my case, I consider it mandatory.

The biggest one of there challenge's is the Volturi finding out.Then Alice decides to leave them and go on a hunt of her own with Jasper.Then Edward and Bella find out that Renesmee has a special gift and that bella has two special gifts.Renesmee has the gift of showing people her thoughts and Bela has self-control and she can shield anybody its just that she has to put her mind to it.Later in the story it is very useful against Janes special power of hurting people telepathically.And Felixs power
B007ZI06FE|4.0|So many of these types of books, these inexpensive stories that don't get pushed by major publishers, get churned out without feeling like they've been in the hands of the editor.  This story was a bit more polished than those, and it managed to avoid some of the other freshman-writer traps.  The author developed a world and background that was interesting without getting bogged down in completely unnecessary details or the desire to prove her own cleverness.  The main character is actually interesting and likable despite her flaws and while the primary love interest is incredibly predictable and a little forced, the author does spend SOME time actually developing the relationship.  The action and plot had a pretty good pace, the supporting cast had enough detail to be interesting, and there is plenty of room for this author to grow into the world that she created.  The climactic finale felt a little rushed and there was a moment at the end where she switched to the perspective of one of the secondary characters in what I suspect was a preview of who will be primary in the next novel, and this switch felt a little jarring and out of place.  But these smaller issues were just speed bumps on what was otherwise an enjoyable ride, with a solid plot and characters that have the potential to be interesting for some time to come.
B000L53D4O|5.0|This toy is one of our top 3 items that our son loves to play with. He gets a huge kick out of walking/running around the house with it! It's light-weight, so that when he gets to a 'dead-end' he picks it up and turns around. And it's definitely durable because he runs into walls and furniture non-stop and the thing still works perfectly. The only thing that could possibly make it better is to have some lights/sounds. All in all - great purchase, totally worth the money!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great story - really a good weave of all the different sub-plots and twists.  Kept my attention and gets to that page-turning riveting spot early on and stays there all the way to the end.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I was unexpectedly surprised. This movie surpassed my expectations. I feel there is a deep messsage hidden in the plot and story line that keeps you guessing
B004FEL6GO|5.0|Bought for my 3 year old nephew who loves cars and robots, this killed two birds with one stone. Toy is very durable, he broke off the doors and fenders on several occassions and they were easily reattached. I would definitely reccommend this toy for children or anyone who likes Transformers.
B009JBZH54|5.0|3 Nolan classics, Blue-ray, less than $30. Any Second thoughts? None. Go for it. This deal is too good to pass it.
1451638450|5.0|My husband and I picked up the first book, [[ASIN:1886778272 The Warrior's Apprentice]] when it first came out.  We've been hooked ever since.  We love them all.<br /><br />For those that have never read this series, you have to start with the first book and continue on.  It's only then that you can appreciate the little tidbits offered in this book.  Like the maple flavored dessert.  Or the mutant comments around the Vor.<br /><br />So we were looking forward to Captain Vorpatril's Alliance and it didn't disappoint.  It was interesting viewing the story from Ivan's viewpoint, he came across as more intelligent than we thought.  Or maybe it's because he's older and wiser.  I loved his interactions with his family, her family, how his past kept creeping in and coloring his actions, especially those underground dark damp closed in places. .. His reactions were so Ivan and so well written I couldn't help but laugh.  Or groan.  How quickly he jumps in for a rescue.  He was amazing and not the clown of previous books.<br /><br />The cameos with Miles were priceless.  Including the missives from loved ones read in that last chapter.  Wonderful, wonderful, I love the characters of this series.  So good that Simeon is back into things and can't wait to see what job Gregor has for him.<br /><br />The only regression I had was Aral is still alive.  That threw me.  So I checked the front area and didn't see the timeline that is in other books.  So I go back to reading but was still a bit stumped because in the last book Mile's father died.  It wasn't until I was done that I saw the timeline was in the back, tucked away, out of sight. So I see this book takes place before the one where Aral dies.  Now that makes sense.  There was also reference to Mile's children and how many he had in this book compared to the last one.  So now I'm straight.<br /><br />I absolutely love Lois McMasters Bujold's books. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful - I just don't have words to describe how much pleasure and enjoyment we get out of them.  Thank you for a wonderful continuation to the series.  - Dan's wifeh pleasure and enjoyment we get out of them.  Thank you for a wonderful continuation to the series.  - Dan's wife
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed this read just as I enjoyed the 50 Shade series. This book is full of drama! Can't wait to read the next in the series!!
B0030BCCAM|3.0|Ok,but was hoping for more.Not bad but could have been much more. Songs only average.Very plain and simple production.somewhat disappointed.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|Like a woodland Forrest and Jenny, two young lovers are torn apart by forces outside of their control.  In this case it's not 'Nam, shrimp boats, and drugs; but, instead, it's the big bad wolf.  More specifically, a werewolf.  Sort of an accelerated version of the tales told to the folks in [[ASIN:B00064LJVO The Village]].  One day after a long-standing truce between the werewolf and the community is severed - the werewolf got a taste of the other white meat - a decision by rowdy townsfolk is made to hunt the BBW (not to be confused with BBW on dating forums).  This leads the townsfolk to bring in a BBW hunter, and ultimately uncover the mystery behind the person who changes at full moon.<br /><br />The positives for this film mostly relate to non-acting aspects.  The set, prop, and costume design are stellar.  The cinematography is at times stunning, with sweeping, snowy landscapes and crystal-clear reflective lakes to entice viewers.  The story is a little lame, even if it is an update to a classic.  Mostly it felt like a poor attempt at a blending the traditional Little Red Riding tale with [[ASIN:B001TLSVVO Twilight]] popularity.  The actors are decent, even if Amanda Seyfried is above her head as a leading lady.<br /><br />It's a decent try, and I don't feel like I wasted my time/money, but I probably will never watch this again unless they come out with a version containing more gruesome deaths or a Seyfried nudity deleted scene.
B000FC1LOC|4.0|The book presents a moral dilemma that evokes a lot of emotion. I kept asking myself what would I chose to do if that were me? All the medical info was boring but I kept reading to see how the issue would be solved. Still thinking about the ending.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I'm 59, grew up on top 40 radio, then Hendrix, Cream, Moody Blues, Procol Harum.... moved on to college/alternative when 70s/80s rock went down the tubes.  Played in bands for many years. I'm a serious listener of jazz and classical music. I'm also a fan of The Killers. When I first sampled this new CD I thought \\"more of the same Killers sound, more of the same old stuff\\".But after two listenings I believe this is their best. Even the ballads, except for \\"Be Still\\", are lush and hard-driving. I highly recommend Battle Born. Five stars.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is beyond amazing. I am at a loss for words as to how to express how much I loved this book. It's a story of love, forgiveness, and acceptance-- it's a story about family. Whether you're a dog lover or not, this book will touch you. I'm not one for emotional hysterics or waterworks for that matter, but I was in tears. I read this book in less than 36 hours because after the first page I was hooked. I even wept (silently) on an airplane while reading it. I was so moved, I remain moved. I'm not kidding when I say that this book changed my life.<br /><br />Happy reading, buying this book will be what I consider a \\"good life choice\\"!

We resolve some of those issues! i was tempted to stop reading after this book... until all the other books in the series were completed! Only because I love happy endings and this one definitely has that! However, my willpower is weak and i will definitely read the others! lol
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Being someone who loves to travel I jumped at the chance to snag one of these beauties! And let me tell you the product in my hands is just that - beautiful! It feels great in my hands and fits the Kindle Fire perfectly. It is not only stylish but durable on the inside and out. The cover is easy to \\"install\\" using elastic straps to keep the Kindle securely in place. The one thing that I do love about this cover is when open there's a pocket to slip your fingers/hand into that give added security to the reader while holding the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Without a doubt it's incredibly sturdy and well made and I love it!
B004KKXMSI|5.0|I have these movies on VHS & on DVD & now in Blu-Ray. This is by far the best quality that you will see these films in. I still enjoy watching all [3] movies after all this time. I guess good movies never get old. The Blu-ray is quite good on all [3] movies although the first one is grainy. I read up on grain in movies & supposedly it's not a bad thing. Although It might be subjective to each one's taste. Once into the film it didn't bother me. I wish they did these in 2:40:1 aspect ratio. Outdoor scenes always seem to be neater in this format. I can't give you a real grade on the audio as I listen with external speakers hooked up to a regular stereo system. Sounds good to me though. All [3] movies have good extra features which I think you will enjoy also. I got this [3] pack Trilogy for under $30.00 so for less than $10.00 each I now have these movies in a real nice quality. I say go ahead & get this Trilogy if you are thinking of buying these films.

B008FOB2B4|5.0|This album is a wonderful masterpiece! It brings us the flavours from electronic and instrumental inspiration of Vangelis (that from '80). And all 3 reprises (Chariots of Fire, Eric's Theme and Abraham's Theme) brings us additional light background sounds that enriches more the tracks without taking the old shine.<br />I have loved the new tracks, a strong and pleasant work! It translates all magnificence and spirit of the movie and the play!<br />Wonderful!!!!!
1421550644|5.0|This set is absolutely perfect. I fell in love with Nausicaa after watching the movie a few years ago, and it quickly became my favorite movie of all time. I just knew I had to read the manga (my first ever!), and luckily I found this boxed set. The artwork is stunning as to be expected of Miyazaki work. The story touches you in places you didn't know existed. Nausicaa is beautiful, strong, caring, and brave. The perfect heroine. I highly recommend this to any manga fan, miyazaki fan, nausicaa fan, ghibli fan, or just to anyone looking to experience an amazing story.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|For sci-fiction buffs, this is a MUST SEE movie.<br />The effects are too good.<br />I've yet to see the movie in 3D but in 2D only the movie is awesome.<br />I've seen the 2D version twice already & so has my family.<br /><br />Only Ridley Scott can make such a great / fantastic / awesome movie.<br />Thanks to Amazon, I bought it under pre-order offer & very cheap.<br /><br />Viraf P Chinoy, Mumbai - India.

B009NOVCTM|5.0|I won't go into all the bruhaha about 'another' Greatest Hits compilation. I will only say this, the 3 cd's that make up the non-deluxe version have 50 tracks. All of the material is remastered, some again since maybe the last time you bought a hits set. What IS good about this set, is the quality and the new tracks. The audio is the best yet in my humble opinion. I listened to all 3 discs in my truck today and they sound excellent! Of course if you are a Stones fan, you will recognize this and you will also recognize a few tracks that have not been included on any previous hits compilation. There is a little booklet included which has a few new or different photos that you may or may not have seen previously as well as the usual track listing, nothing much here to justify the booklet. Now for the good part. The really good part! If you have not heard the new material which consists of two songs...Gloom and Doom and One More Shot, then I would say buy this set for those only if no other reason, they are that good! Mick sounds like he is singing back in the 70's, his voice is great! I mean really great. The rest of the boys sound good too. Gloom and Doom is my favorite it is a solid rocker and is a hit, as it would have been back in the day even! I know it sounds crazy to pay 22.95 or so for two songs, but if you like classic rock and still like the music, then it is well worth it. And, you get the bonus of a lot of their best material sounding better than it ever has. Now what is NOT to like about that! I will take what I can get and this is freaking great! I just hope that there were more songs recorded in the session that they did the new material and we will get those at some later date. If they are anywhere near as good as these two then I am smiling!
0451232852|4.0|I read this book in about 4 days - not bad for an almost 1,000 page novel! I really enjoyed the author's characters and, unlike other reviewers, I really appreciated when he had two of his characters interacting in an unlikely place (for example, one character on the British side of the trench and one on the German side). It was really interesting to hear about the same thing from two opposite perspectives and I was able to suspend my disbelief that in a war with millions of soldiers these characters could end up in the same place at the same time. My only complaint is that the ending was a little too happy - pretty much everything I wanted to happen did end up happening. It felt like a bit of a cop-out since life doesn't always end up perfectly the way we'd want it to - especially in wartime. I was also a little shocked by how fast the author ended the WWI era and started setting up for the second book. Each of the beginning chapters was covering a month or even a couple days. At the end, Follett was speeding through the 1920s to set up for the Nazi-Germany plot of his second book. All in all, I'm still glad I read it and I will read the second one.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Frankl's masterpiece is a must read for anyone who studies the Holocaust. Frankl writes of the need to find meaning and the positive side and strength in the midst of the most dire circumstances. Even though it is relatively short, plan on spending some time with this book because you will constantly be reading, and re-reading each section because it is so meaningful. Perhaps the most powerful sentiment - \\"...everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\"
B005OK721G|4.0|It has all the typical Luc Besson stuff... Lots of shooting, punching, kicking, and explosions, and bad guys that have CHS (Can't Hit Sh*t)..<br /><br />Having said that though, there is usually something out of the ordinary in his films...  In this one... A beautiful latina who takes care of herself so well, she makes Angelina Jolie from SALT look like an old, slow, and out of shape! I love action films where the women kick butt and don't bother with names.<br /><br />Columbiana's parents were killed by drug dealers, and even as a child, she shows SERIOUS back bone getting away from them. She then finds someone to train her to have revenge.<br /><br />The rest of the film is PAYBACK... and the personal cost for revenge!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I've noticed that this doesn't have certain blocks like in the PC version.  (TNT, etc.)  I would like it if those could be added.  Other than that it's a great game and it is really fun.

0061134007|5.0|I really loved the speedy delivery and satisfying read of Jo Nesbo's first novel.....he is wonderful at writing crime novels that take place near his home of Norway.....the characters are well described and the plot thickens with each turn of the page. This crime detective novel is amazing and easy to read, with over 100 chapters at about 3 to 4 pages each....an excellent book for crime buffs....very similar to legend Henning Mankell. I believe this won many awards...Jo Nesbo is now inspiring many young writers with his work, and has become well known from Norway to America. Don't miss out....I give Nesbo's first work five stars...his other works are wonderful too I'm sure and would probably merit four stars...though I doubt any of his others can top this one.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it ok but fun like I like it but I could be better ... my little sister is always keeps playing this game all the time she must like it
B00992CF6W|4.0|i love minecraft. i was overjoyed to see this version. however i do not like the controls right now. it feels clunky. i am sure however that future updates will fix this. my daughter will love it though. she does not play onthe 360 so she will not know the difference in controls.
B008D19WBQ|4.0|For those of us who have been awaiting this long time release of Friends on Blu Ray... It's unfortunate that the below reviews are true. These episodes are the original television broadcasts and are missing many parts that we have come to love in the extended DVD versions. If you are a huge Friends fan as I am, you'll be able to tell where the spots of missing footage are. Sometimes it spoils the episode from the extended version, but otherwise you'll get over it. I wish the Blu Ray was the extended episodes. Hopefully in the future at some point we can get the DVD extended version on Blu Ray. For now this will do for me as I have been playing my DVD versions for a long time and needed an upgrade to discs that don't scratch as much.

1401324649|1.0|This is the stupdiest book I have ever attempted to read.  I love history, must have read at least 1500 history books. I love senior humor because I am a senior. I am an avid reader. At least 2 or 3 books a week. can not get through a book that is this stupid.  The greatest insult you can give an author is to not finish his book. Boy I am so insulting this book.  I do not believe in throwing books away, but this is so tempting, no wonder the paper is cheap.  Dont waste your money or time on this book.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I first read the book Pricess of Mars in the ninth grade close to 50 years ago and then read the rest of the Mars series.  As the years went by, I reread these books from time to time.  Although I enjoyed the movie itself, the story had been so changed as to only have some of the vague ideas from it.  To see the Therns so early in the story and with such power was very dissapointing.  If you plan to see this mvie because you have read the book, be prepared for the fact that this is nothing at all like the book.  Woola is actually cute in this version.  I was so looking forward to how he was depicted. OH WELL!  The faithful Woola.  Maybe some day, someone will make a movie according to the book(s).
B008KRJWEK|5.0|excellent game. my new favorite. I can not stop playing this game.  its so addicting that I'd rather play this than any other game right now.

B004LWZWBU|5.0|My husband and I didn't see this at the cinema as it got poor reviews but it was everything I like to see in a movie. It was touching and cute and the birds were beautiful. I recorded it on DVR but will now buy it. It's a keeper, full of great acting and stunning photography and cinematography. See it. You won't be sorry. Now, if you find this review offends you in any way, fine, but keep that to yourself and don't attack me (as has been done in the past) if I disagree with you. Thanks.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|While The Fame established Lady Gaga as a pop superstar, The Fame Monster made her even more famous with the release of the ever-popular \\"Bad Romance\\" as its lead single. Soon enough, \\"Telephone\\" (featuring Beyoncé) was released as the second single and became an instant success and so did its Kill Bill-themed music video, which turned out to be more popular than the song!!! \\"Alejandro\\" and \\"Dance in the Dark\\" were released as the third and fourth singles respectively and also achieved success on the charts. Although not released as singles these songs did have the potential to become ones: \\"Monster\\" and \\"Teeth\\". The only ballad on the album, \\"Speechless\\", is a moving song that discusses Lady Gaga's father and his addiction to drugs. \\"So Happy I Could Die\\" isn't I would say single material, but I guess it's a good song too. This EP rocks.
B00846REIS|5.0|I liked Fifty Shades of Grey, but this book Kept me wanting more... LOVED IT!!! can't wait to read the next book.
B001GM28HO|4.0|The Fame is Lady Gaga's debut album and it is amazing. It contains elements from pop, dance and electronic music, all rolled into one and every song has a perfect blend of each genre. The best songs on the album are \\"Just Dance\\" (featuring Colby O'Donis), \\"Beautiful, Dirty Rich\\", \\"Poker Face\\", \\"LoveGame\\", \\"Paparazzi\\", \\"The Fame\\", \\"Starstruck (featuring Space Cowboy and Flo Rida), \\"Boys Boys Boys\\".
B007EECSFA|2.0|it was a good story, but the way it was written was a bit conveluted.<br />if was however good enough I could not put it down until I finished.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|Towards the end of her touring activities in 2011, Lady Gaga released the smash single, \\"Born This Way\\", in February 2011 and it became an instant success, topping the charts in various countries across the globe in just a few days. \\"Judas\\" followed in April 2011 and a month later, the album Born This Way was released to rave reviews and positive reception from Gaga's fan base. The hits kept on coming with the release of her singles \\"The Edge of Glory\\", \\"You and I\\" and \\"Marry the Night\\", which also achieved great success on the charts. In 2012, she embarked on the Born This Way Ball World Tour, touring countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, Oceania and South America and in 2013, she's returning to the USA to tour and she may be coming to a city near you. Anyway, great album and besides the singles, other great songs on the album are \\"Americano\\", \\"Schiebe\\" and \\"Hair\\". In my opinion, this is the best album of 2011.

1455508977|5.0|Nicholas Sparks fascinated many again by his amazing approach to a romantic yet sorrow love story. His incredible details captivates not only your mind but your heart as well. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great laugh, cry, and to warm your heart.<br />My favorite part of this book was the ending and how it made you want to be in the characters shoes and want the same love that Sparks writes about. I can't wait to read it again.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not a bad book but more of the same from the previous book in the series.  The story is rather twisted and not a \\"feel good\\" type of story so it would have been nice if the second book had some variations rather than just recycle the first storyline.<br /><br />This book ends very abruptly and doesn't reach a smooth stopping point (like the author ran out paper or used up all the allotted characters)so you better have the next book close at hand. However, I have to admit the writing was not bad and the story is alright (if disturbing).

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|As with the rest of the series, this is not a bad book.  The premise is rather twisted and not a \\"feel good\\" type of story and even the relationships are very tentative and very \\"settle for the ruins\\" style.<br /><br />This book and the predecessor end very abruptly (like the author ran out paper or used up all the allotted characters) but I have to admit the writing was not bad and the story is alright (if disturbing).

1400067820|5.0|I once was married to an economist, had a brilliant physicist for a father (and a son), and mothered another child who spent his toddler years counting in base seven. The books these men recommended to me were often large, dull, soporific in spite of theses that were pure genius (I include the author's previous works here sadly).<br /><br />In the intervening years I have become familiar with the author's arguments, his culture and customs (how could this possibly matter? It adds richness and context to Taleb's arguments, as well as an imagined sound to his voice), and I can say Antifragile virtually leapt to life as I opened each chapter. It is an easy read, filled with anecdotes that illuminate, hypotheses that gratify, and an overall sense of rightness.<br /><br />My own field is healthcare; it is so full of micro-managed nonsense as to be meaningless in the aggregate; \\"meaningful use\\" comes to mind as the sort of self-justifying bureaucratic hamster wheel that guarantees employment without consequence - or conscience. Healthcare is a perfect example of a system that \\"breaks and breaks/ And lives by breaking\\" (with apologies to the poet, Stanley Kunitz). We can only hope to practice a robust medicine one-on-one, outliving yet another fragile and foolish reform that is shiny, expensive, distracting, and in the end weakens us as clinicians.<br /><br />I look forward to rereading sections of this book in an effort to develop more Antifragile patterns of thought and participation within systems.
B006O6F932|3.0|OK, any monster high fan is going to love this toy.  My 8 year old daughter loves it and plays with it.  All the little extras really do make a big difference.  She really likes all the different rooms, etc.  The big downside to this toy is how poorly it was made.  For the amount of money they charge for this toy, it should be more durable.  It says for kids 6 years and up and kids can be rough with their toys.  It also makes for playing with the dolls hard because things don't go together easy and stay together or fall over while playing.  I gave it a 3 overall because I think that it is a shame that the quality of toys is going so down hill for what they are charging.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Very challenging and I would have loved to keep it but......my 5 year old make 3 separate in-game purchases for mechanic's help.  Couldn't figure out how to block it so we had to unload it.  Would be a great physics game for older kids.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I love Lotus! That Lotus(intro)was probably one of my favorite Christina songs ever! My other favs are Red Hot Kinda Love, Make the world move, Sing for me(gorgeous) and Best of Me. There's a couple I'm not in love with but overall, its a great record. Christina looks gorgeous and natural in the CD booklet and she sounds amazing as well. Today's pop stars would give up there first born for that voice. So I don't understand why they can release any oh poppy mediocre song and it hits #1 but poor Christina constantly has a battle on her hands because it seems like no matter what she does, people are never happy! I've been a fan of hers since 2000 and it seems like every album she releases, there are pissed off fans who are offended that it didn't sound like the last release before it. Stripped is treated as the greatest thing ever but when it first came out, people were turned off because it wasn't poppy and cute like her debut. \\"Dirrty\\" stalled at #48 on the charts and yet, its widely known, still played at the clubs and considered one of her signature songs. How crazy is that? When Back to Basics dropped(my personal favorite)fans complained that it wasn't the ever raw, controversial Stripped. When Bionic dropped, people tore her to pieces for being too edgy, too incohesive and too Gaga-ish (that whole Lady Gaga fiasco was so overblown, it's ridiculous). Now she releases Lotus, and folks have the nerve to defend Bionic as more creative and out of the box even though they obviously didn't bother to support it enough. Now when her next album comes out in a couple of years, am I gonna hear how it's not as \\"phenomenal\\" as Lotus? Most Likely!<br /><br />She's either shouting or not using her voice enough. Too edgy or too safe. Too raunchy or too simple. Too this or too that! Ugh, I can't imagine how frustrating it must be for her to release something she as well as her fans will be pleased with because her so called fans are always all over the map with her. I don't like britney spears, I think she has zero talent, zero intelligence, no backbone, and her music has never evolved passed catchy hooks and dancable beats, but I have to give it to her fans, they support their girl in droves despite her obvious flaws. People are so nasty to Christina, I'm not mad at her for making songs like \\"Circles\\" and \\"Shut Up\\", where she vents her frustrations at her detractors. She's big voiced, theatrical, sexy and experimental but you see her vulnerability and sadness on a lot of her tracks, so its amazing to me that people feel alienated by her cause they assume that she's some mean, cold person. Hardly! How can someone be so cold when they belt out something like \\"Best of me\\" or \\"Sing for me\\". I almost shed tears when I heard those tracks cause I could just picture her in her great big mansion on a regular Sunday afternoon feeling sad over the garbage said about her. Wouldn't it hurt you? I think if Christina went on a Lotus world tour, the album would do just fine. Stripped didn't do all that great when it first released, but as she toured and released more singles, it became a smash! I recommend Lotus as a great pop album and one of the best new releases this year!

B009CG939M|5.0|I love this movie. I got the HD version for my Kindle Fire HD and it downloaded quickly and the picture is amazing. Hellboy touches my heart because he trys so hard to fit in and also for the love he shows Liz. If you haven't seen part one, watching this will not make a big difference. I actually watched this one first and then the first one. I have them both now on my Kindle.

B009B8YZKS|5.0|This show, although short, pretty much sums up the theme of Halo and the Halo Universe. It has great action sequences and excellent cinematography.

1451695195|3.0|This book is interesting and has some brief insights into God and the spiritual world. The books main focus, however, is on Dr. Alexander's condition in the hospital and how it was impossible that his experience was produced by his brain. He spends very little time discussing the actual experience. I think his main focus was to convince the medical/scientific community that he did go to the afterlife and his brain didn't just conjure up the images. If you are looking for a book that describes the afterlife and God and helps you with insights into navigating the world, then you will be disappointed. I would love to read more about the actual experience, without Dr. Alexander's assessment of it. He says he felt like he spent years there, but maybe 10% of the book is dedicated to describing the experience. It's an easy read at 188 pages including the appendix and has some interesting insights, so I would still recommend it, but it really leaves out some the essentials in my opinion. I would love to read his \\"notes\\" on the experience. I am someone who has a scientific background but also does believes in God and the afterlife, so I don't think I am his target audience. I don't think this book contradicts Christian or other religious dogmas (to the extent of my knowledge) as some people have mentioned in other reviews. He also is not a writer and his descriptions are hard to visualize. Now we've had a scientist, maybe the next book can be written by a talented writer, who has the ability to spark the imagination and share the memories in a way that helps the reader visualize the experience.

B00000J048|2.0|This toy looks like fun but is very frustrating for the kids with whom I work.  First it requires that you put the base together which is quite difficult for little hands.  Then you have to put the gears on the top and that requires advanced planning that is far too advanced for little ones until they are well into elementary school.  I presented it to several different kids of different ages and stages and it was not something that any asked to try again.
B008RTE09S|5.0|An absolute must for Beatles fans and anyone interested in history of the last century. Filled with great songs, interesting fashion, weird characters, and a time when the world was a little bigger. Imagine the 1960s with no cell-phones, no computers or internet in every home. Add to it the power and popularity of the Beatles, and then throw in a dash of innocent drug-altered craziness. This movie is like looking through a time-portal and getting the feeling of what it may have been like to hang out John, George, Ringo and Paul during the height of their popularity. The extras on the disc make it an amazing document of the times. The picture looks beautiful especially compared to previous releases of the film. Check it out and be stunned with amazing sights and sounds! -JL

The cover is stunning and her photography and styling is gorgeous. The book radiates a warmth and nurturing feeling, and it just makes me want to get straight into the kitchen. The recipes are also inviting and uncomplicated and I can't wait to include it as a stocking filler this Christmas. Don't hesitate - just buy it!
B00000K3D4|5.0|I loved this movie when I was younger. When I found it on DVD I immediately got it for some of my grandkids.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved season 1, and thought that while the middle of season 2 dragged a bit it was also very good. But season 3 is blowing me away! Liking the new characters introduced so far and loving the prison setting. And, Amazon made it easy for me to cut cable seems this was the only show I really cared enough about to consider keeping cable, but having the option to view it the next day for under $2 is great.

B0063ESZ9K|3.0|I like how the Fujifilm X10 looks and enjoy taking pictures with it. The leather case for X10 from FujiFilm certainly looks good and suits well with the camera. The case is well constructed and even the leather strap that comes with the case is of higher quality than the one that comes with the camera. Also the case the offers good protection and coverage to the camera.<br /><br />Here's the problem. I always use the lens hood. And the top half of the case doesn't fit the camera with the lens hood on. So if I want to use the full case, I would have to take the hood off every time. That's a lot of trouble.<br /><br />And then its the access to the battery/memory card compartment. The lower half case covers the compartment door and you will need to take the case off in order to access the battery and the memory card. So every single time you need to download photo (via the memory card) or access the battery, you will have to take the lower half case off. That's quite a bit of trouble.<br /><br />Though the case looks good and protects well. I ended up replacing it with a half case that I can access the compartment door without removing the case from the camera. And use a camera wrap to protect the camera while its in my bag.<br /><br />Its a nice case, but not what I wanted.
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|I saw this movie at a Movie Tavern with my wife and 5 yr old daughter. Have to say it was an enjoyable movie based on true events that I vaguely remember. The story centers around the efforts of a small, remote town in the northernmost point in Alaska to save a whale family trapped beneath the quickly freezing ice. The story gains national and international attention and many different people from around the country converge on the town in an attempt to free the trapped whales.<br />The movie does a nice job in sending an environmental/work together message without being too heavy handed and preachy. There aren't too many over the top/unnecessary melodramatic conflicts and the story rightly remains centered around the efforts to rescue the whales. The performances are all good, save that Drew Barrymore is overacting a bit. This is no special effects spectacular, just a nice little movie that is enjoyable to watch and certainly family friendly. Easy to recommend
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I resisted buying this for some time because, well, the description simply did not do this book justice and I was reluctant to shell out 12.99 for an e-book (don't get me started on the pricing, that's a separate story!).  I'm glad I did!!<br /><br />John Corey and his wife Kate are off to Yemen to pursue an American citizen terrorist aptly named the Panther.  The bulk of the story takes place in Yemen, where Demille does a masterful job in describing the people, culture, terrain and history -- this backdrop blends so well with the plot and storyline.  The setting is excellently described and the plot is woven in a similar fashion.  There is a ton of intrigue -- the real bad guys aren't always clear here, as in the prior books. Most importantly, you don't need to have read the other books with Corey and his wife as the primary characters to appreciate this one.<br /><br />The story kept me very much engaged, one of the few books I couldn't manage to put down and stayed up late reading.  The characters are well developed, the plot is intricate without being overly complex and the resolution very satisfying.  While the conspiracy theory aspect (government agents seems to be more rogue than I consider realistic) may be slightly overdone, it doesn't spoil the fun.  Get it and read it!
0446580848|5.0|Nelson DeMille is one of my very favorite suspense writers, and the irreverent and hilarious John Corey, one of my favorite characters.  I loved the plot and the action, but I also found very interesting the history and background concerning Yemen.  I actually hit the iPad to read about and view the places and some of the objects in the story.  also, I loved the plot twist near the end and the broad hint as to the topic of the next John Corey centered novel.  my only complaint is that DeMille makes me wait too long between books.  Get writing, your fans await!
B001NLKT60|4.0|Having read the first Dragon Tattoo installment I believe makes The Girl Who Played with Fire even a better read, although not a necessity. Moves fast with few or no lag to the story. Salanger continues to develope into a more and more complicated heroin.Story line jumps sporaticly, but slowly comes together with logical tie ins.Good read !
0307352145|4.0|The author does use examples of social and political figures over a wide period of time to make her points. Easily relatable and quick to make her points. She has debunked the myths I believed about myself. Self-help book that has nurtured my own understanding and my role in society.
1423113454|4.0|This was an amazing book to read. It was funny, had cool fighting scenes, and show cased great family values. This book is better to read if you have some background information about Egyptian mythology, so you have a better understanding of what is happening throughout the book. Rick Riordan is a genius when it come to writing about ancient mythology meets the modern day world. This book was finely detailed and at times it felt like you are their world.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|since this was written by a neurosurgeon who claimed to be a skeptic, i was expecting a less religious spin on his interpretation of his experiences. the last few chapters were too philosophicaly preachy and pontificating
B0015DYIH2|3.0|I'm biased because I am a huge Twilight fan. I will be at the movies tomorrow to see the 2nd 1/2 of Breaking Dawn, the movie. Great book. Meyer has an amazing imagination.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|An orphaned 12 year old boy scout in 1965 and the 12 year year old girl he falls innocently in love with... Wonderful cast, great script, incredibly evocative, great direction, beautifully shot; Wes Anderson's best film so far.
B009VB97EY|4.0|A little boring from my point of view. You knew what was going to happen in this film. This is not one I would watch again.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Haven't finished reading the book, kind of lost interest.  I found it to be weak on biblical basis.  I did find it interesting that he actually experienced a spiritual journey for the seven days he was \\"gone\\"<br />His medical perspective is interesting, perhaps I'll pick the book back up when I have more time.
B00003CWOL|5.0|Having been a fan of Kevin Smith since 7th grade, I must say that Dogma is one of my favorite movies not just by Smith, but in general. Being a Christian, I was NOT offended by this in any way, shape or form. Truly funny. All of the actors from Mewes  to Affleck do an excellent job, and I must say Kevin is a genius at filmmaking! If you idolize Kevin Smith with all your heart, buy and watch Dogma, You'll laugh, no matter what your religion is. It's just a movie, so don't take it seriously, okay?<br /><br />In the words of Jason Mewes, Snooch to the nooch!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Except for some minor changes to make the film more exciting, this is based on a true story.  The cities in PA were changed for the movie, but that's about all that was changed.
B000KIRT6A|1.0|If you move any EQ slider off of \\"zero\\", either up or down, this unit produces a very obvious hiss; making it unuseable.  It gets worse the farther you move off any \\"zero\\" setting.  The Berhinger EQ700 is a very disappointing product.<br /><br />This is not a negative review of the seller; just the product.
B00448SE4S|3.0|Compressing the story undercut a lot of the commentary of the comic, but Edgar Wright's kinetic direction caught the flavor of the action and the soundtrack rocked. Brie Larson as Envy Adams singing Black Sheep was a standout.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A classic , Dickens is so descriptive , its like he is writing a painting of bygone times, with a message that is so apt for today.
0307277887|4.0|Why read: I really like the TV series.<br /><br />What impressed me: Dexter is wholly unique. He's such an awesome, messed up, while still being logical, creeptastic, yet average, character. I completely love the entire concept of this series and this first book promises lots of wacky serial killer mayhem in the future.<br /><br />What disappointed me: I watched the show first, which is always a big mistake. The book is great, but I missed out of reading it without any preconceived notions. Totally my fault, but still a little disappointing.<br /><br />Recommended: Absolutely.<br /><br />Continue series: Definitely.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a physician/scientist also, my firm belief in God and life everlasting has been confirmed by Dr. Alexander's outstanding book.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This was a good book. I have liked all of the Jack Reacher Novels. They are full of excitment, You never know what will happen next
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Lets face it, this movie is dull, predictable and terribly written (unobtanium? Really?). But it looks amazing. By far the best 3D of any movie made so far.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This was a cute, moving real-life story with a lot of interesting situations. I would repcommend it.  It disproves stereo-typing.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Hadn't seen this in the theater, but on a 65\\" 3DTV it looked amazing. And the movie itself is fun although it certainly could have been 30 minutes shorter.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|This movie was written by a genius!  What a creative concept.  I love anything with Anthony Hopkins.  All of his movies have a deep background that he plays very well.
B006H5120E|4.0|You should know what to expect from the movie unless you're the one person on the planet that hasn't seen it. But as far as a 3D conversion, I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe it's because it's a James Cameron movie, but no expense was spared, it looks amazing.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I saw the funny moments in this book as well as the strength and courage. Its great that the author allowed us to see her family's struggles and triumphs.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Not the best movie in the world, but certainly not terrible. SFX and 3D are fantastic throughout. As far as a prequel to Alien, maybe the last 5 seconds are. The rest seems pretty unrelated and poses more questions than it answers.
B009FZFONO|1.0|The video quality was very poor. I didnt see much improvement to standard one. The sound also was not up to par. I would like a refund for this if possible
B003VANOFY|4.0|I love it so far. Had it for a few months. The join tha tsomeone metioned does seem to be a little weak looking, and the ear cups I've heard will need replacing after a year, but other than that I wouldn't want another device. I've went through a lot of headsets and this one was the first I liked all around! Would have been 5 stars, but since I have been warned it will have structural issues later (that they should hopefully replace) I gave it 4.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|This is what I call great Rock! This is my first Black Keys album, though definitely not the last one I buy. My two favorites are \\"Lonely Boy\\" and \\"Gold on the Ceiling\\", but the whole album is great. Very addicting.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is extremely addictive works great and is fun. Anyone not showing this game what it deserves hasn't played
B00005OCMR|2.0|This version has been remastered.  The major problem is they have changed the picture.  The movie has been heavily darkened and the color saturation is turned WAY up.  The blue is turned way up along with all other colors, but the red has been cranked up absurdly high.  It ruins the feel of the movie completely, the movie is way too colorful now, when before it had a kind of washed out black and white feel which was a big part of its unique look.  The glowing of the characters is way to vibrant now along with everything else and the movie is way too dark.  When before there was alot of grey now everything is a rich blue or red.  And for some reason the sound is much worse, I think that they used dolby noise reduction on it, silimar to what was used on audio tapes and it messed up the treble.  The sound is not as crisp, It definitely does not sound as good as the original, which I just watched a few days before.<br /><br />The only positive thing I noticed is they have fixed a few scenes where there was some minor screen shaking for like a millisecond... which was not a big deal really.<br /><br />Go with the original.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|This is a good video; however, my husband swears that there are scenes missing from the movie that were in the original movie when we saw it in the theater.  After watching more closely I agreed with him.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I had high expectations for the third book in the Heroes series and was not disappointed. I look forward to the next installment of the series and to more of Riordan's magic.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I have been around horses all of my life and this story warmed my heart.  I encourage anyone to read this book.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|So addicting! Love this game! Wish there was more of a variety of words without having to use all the bombs. Other than that..Awesome!
B0009S4IHY|5.0|this is a very funny video i had seen it be for and enjoyed then ,i would recomend it to everyone
B0091REZMW|1.0|After the introduction the game froze! I was unable to continue doing anything. The graphics were out of focus including the words explaining where your items were. Needs to be updated.
B009GENZKS|3.0|The film was beautiful in a visual since and the big boys in black were more scary than any of the zombie or licker characters... Although it was a great way spend an evening the story (unless your a Resident Evil fan from the beginning) lost me. The gorgeous chic in the heels was a character I have never seen before but the story went on as though she was a character from back in the day. The president and her awesome back scar even showed a little skin and on top of that did some great CQB with the formentioned chic in heels... that was... GREAT! But we keep coming back to leon and his little rebel group... I don't know if I got up to get a beer or went to take a leak and missed some vital plot points or what but I found my understanding of the plot missing some key points. Leon crying about his vacation (get a haircut and get over it, douche bag) the lickers were so formidable in the past CGI's of the franchise but the big boys in black treated them as though they were roaches under foot. SO, who was the old man? Who was the school teacher turned rebel leader turned crippled school teaher? What happened to the dumb bimbo from the other films? If it were not for the giant SS storm troopers completly crushing everything and everyone at the climax I would have come away with alot of questions but it was still a fun dive into the genra even if it left me feeling as though I came into the conversation late. The relationship between America and Russia? Who was the hotty talking to at the end about the cheesy organism in the jar? Just so many questions... Not all that many zombies now that I think about it. Do any of these CGI productions fall in line with either the movie story lines or the video game's story? I suspect this film would blow your mind if you smoked some good grass or took some bad s%#t and sat there watched it on an empty stomach. Perhaps it would all make since then.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I love to cook and when I cant this is what I do. don't listen to the bad reviews about the gems costing money well they do but you can get them another way that is why they give you different levels for each dish you get a gem when you reach level 2 and level 4 of each dish. plus you get offers so you can win more gems. I deff recommend this game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love the timed trials! my husband and I always try to beat each others time! Fun for kids too!
B003UESJF6|5.0|With a great cast and remarkable animation, this movie was hilarious.  The eye movements of the characters had me laughing as much as the dialogue.  Great movie!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have read all of Ken Follett's historical fiction (Pillars of the Earth, etc.) and I continue to marvel at his unique ability to turn history into gripping (and immensely readable) drama. I love the fact that even though the underlying human drama is fictional, the historical backdrop is basically accurate.<br /><br />Fall of Giants, which is centered around the events leading up to WWI as well as the war itself, is a masterful commentary on the basic human failings and unnecessary grief and suffering associated with most armed conflicts that continues to haunt us even today. Although many casual observers (non-historians) generally put WWI on the same footing as WWII (a noble and necessary war), history in general and this book in particular, casts a spotlight on what a monumental and unnessary waste of human life it actually was. There are also many interesting insights into the social caste systems that dominated western civilization during the early 20th century and the resulting social upheavals as those systems began to disintegrate.<br /><br />In short, the book is immensely entertaining while also delivering historically meaningful social insights.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much and I am an adult!  I am sure kids would like it as it is very well done and quite funny.
B008M9PHWM|4.0|Very good Dylan album, but not as good as the hype would have you believe. Some killer tracks on here, most notably the rocky, shambling \\"Narrow Way,\\" \\"Duquesne Whistle,\\" and \\"Soon After Midnight.\\" Those are the first three tracks on the album, and IMO, far and away the best. Some later filler and some rambly repetition makes the rest of the album less captivating. \\"Tempest\\" is just way too long and dull, not even close to something like \\"Highlands,\\" for example. Still better than Together Through Life, at least. That isn't saying much, though, as I never warmed up to that record.<br /><br />Vinyl sounds fantastic. Very much worth the buy. Livelier and more in your face than the CD, no compression or loudness or digital crap to deal with here. Nice to see some artists still recording for real music formats like vinyl and even CD now. Digital has been convenient, but man, has it ever ruined the sound of so many albums. Some new vinyl is almost unplayable. Not Tempest. It's superb. Just wish the album itself was more on the level of modern Dylan classics like Love & Theft and Modern Times.
1936608618|5.0|I have read many books on fitness I will definitely put Power, Speed, and Endurance at the top of my must read list.<br />* First off, the layout is wonderful the color tabs, pictures, and explicit details have been great<br />* Second, the Running chapter is written and illustrated so well I thought I was in the CrossFit Endurance course all over again<br />* Third, the Cycling chapter had some great hints that I have started using and improved my rides immensely, just by looking at a few pictures weird I know<br />* Fourth, the Swimming chapter one of my favorite pass times and the crawl has been covered in a very well straight to the point way<br />* Fifth, the Strength-and Conditioning chapter should take all of the ifs, ands, and buts about strength-and-conditioning out of the endurance factor and show that getting stronger will definitely help in all aspects<br />* Sixth, the Mobility chapter is still one of my favorites without it I think that many endurance athletes would be in a very stiff mess. Keep in mind all of these mobility exercises will not feel great but after you perform them and see the improvement you will believe<br />* Seventh, the Fueling Protocol chapter is great because if you do not understand the activities you do you will suffer in one way or the other due to not getting the nutrition you need at the point of breaking or even in the pre-event meals when and what.<br />* Eighth, the CrossFit Endurance Programming this chapter is broken down so well I think anyone will be very happy with the breakdown. He has gone into a great deal of detail hear leaving so many tidbits of information to help everyone on the schemes of programming.<br />Keep this in mind I have just thrown some tidbits here guys keep in mind this is one of the best laid out informational source for endurance training I have ever seen. I will say all that anyone needs to do is buy the book it is a great book.
B000BHHVPO|4.0|Firstly, it is really a pretty modest statement to say that this is one of the greatest music DVD sets that you could buy, period. The scope is wide, the scale immense, and most importantly of course it relates to a a serious ethical cause, so it is not *just* great entertainment.<br /><br />Anyway, the inherent nature of this sort of concert event is that, unless you are incredibly eclectic in taste, there will be some featured artists whom you don't like as much as others. But the variety, in context, is a good thing here. This is *a lot* of music, primarily from London and Philadelphia, but also with performances from Berlin, Paris, Canada, Tokyo, South Africa, and St. Petersburg.<br /><br />The opening/closing slots are filled with the biggest superstar acts, and while U2, Sting, The Who and Paul McCartney all fit that bill, frankly I found the younger acts to be generally the more interesting. The Killers, Keane and Snow Patrol all really give great performances. I have to say that I enjoy the Black Eyed Peas set as well. Of course, the Pink Floyd reunion was a big deal for Live 8, and that is here, including some background footage/interviews. I find it interesting to contrast Mariah Carey with Madonna. The former seems kind of out of touch, while the latter really lives up to her reputation as a legendary act (thankfully without doing anything objectionable that I recall), with a great band, great arrangements, giving just a great performance period.<br /><br />I do not give this item 5 stars because of, more than anything I guess, the Will Smith part of the concert. Do we really need 4 or 5 Will Smith songs, with him going off on just about the biggest eye-rolling ego trip that I have ever seen? Also, Coldplay come across as extremely boring. They are one of my favorite bands, but this iteration has some things in common with cardboard. Especially \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" which Chris Martin introduces as \\"the greatest song ever\\" or some such, only to immediately use it to underwhelm. Oh well.<br /><br />There are some decent segments of bonus footage, and the \\"Final Push\\" concert (which was recorded some days later in Edinburgh) might be my favorite part of it all. On the whole, if you appreciate a wide variety of music and can rationalize the purchase price, this is definitely worth getting.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Having misplaced my original Kindle Fire cable, and all other fitting USB cables failing to be able to charge it, I ordered this \\"Amazon Kindle Fire\\" charger, for the obvious reason.  After turning it on after hours in charge mode, my Kindle still only had little % power left & refused to power up.  Thankfully I found my original cable, naturally it was right in front of my face, and plugged it in, and low & behold, it was fully charged.  This replacement went back and the return process was painless.
0374214913|5.0|What is the mystery behind Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour bookstore? An unemployed web-designer takes a job doing the night shift at the bookstore, and he, his new-found Google girlfriend, and his best friend (and fellow fantasy role-play fan) from middle school, who is - conveniently - now a millionaire, set off to unravel the mystery. Intelligent, fun, funny, and whatever the 2012 word for \\"hip\\" is, this book is a delightful and enjoyable read that finds the intersection between books, technology, and friendship. Highly recommended.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a beautiful, peaceful way to pass the time while exercising your mind. It requires not only logic, but also critical thinking, in a fun quest to capture all the pearls on the board in a limited number of moves. Well drawn graphics and beautiful, soothing music, combined with a graphical hint mechanism, make this one of the best games ever. When you're ready for another challenge, you can move on to Quell Reflect. Another great choice.

B0096I9UTE|4.0|Kylie Minogue has been singing 25 years, and this album is a celebration of those years. In London, at Abbey Road Studios, Kylie sings 16 of her tracks rearranged and revised. She is even accompanied by a full orchestra, which adds a new sound to those classic songs. There was a big-band feel to the whole album, although at times I felt it was similar to country. Amongst my favorite tracks were the classic Locomotion and the newly arranged Can't Get You Out Of My Head. I also loved Hand On Your Heart. My exact words were, \\"It has a John Mayer feel to it....\\" That's good in my books! I love his music, and I love Kylie too. I remember hearing the Locomotion when it came out, back in the 80's, and was happy to hear the arrangement on this album. She stays true to the song, and it worked! The only song I didn't feel was, Finer Feelings. Ironic, right? It just didn't capture me like the others. With that said, I liked the album as a whole and think it would make a great stocking stuffer, or addition to a Christmas gift.
034580404X|5.0|Good books!!!.  YES!!!!  Have heard the books called women's porn, and I guess they really are that.  Some people might be offended by the degree of detail that she goes into.  But you have to keep an open mind about those kinds of things.  The books were boxed VERY nicely as a set.  Am glad that is the way I bought them.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Really nice. After using both bought the share wear version. Once you calibrate your unit found it to be very accurate. Would definitely reccomend

086571701X|5.0|WOW! I absolutely loved this book. I knew very little about aquaponics before reading this book. I feel like Aquaponic Gardening covers everything I need to know about getting my system set up. The concepts are so easy to understand. What a great how-to!<br /><br />I loved section 2 \\"the plan\\". As an impulsive/spontaneous person I tend to get ahead of myself when it comes to DIY or home projects...This section helped paint a CLEAR picture on what I need to do to properly set up my system the first try!<br /><br />I am so thankful for this inspiring guide into the world of aquaponics. I will use this book as a reference when going through the whole process. I CANT WAIT TO GET STARTED!! I hope Santa brings me a grow bed for Christmas.<br /><br />Thank You Sylvia Bernstein!!
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|It's great for the price, just a basic black protective cover. It is not bulky and annoying and the texture helps you to hold onto the phone and not drop it so much!

B009VB7P6G|5.0|All 3 of my granddaughters, ages 13, 12 and 8 loved this movie! They did not move the entire time it was on. My 8 year old granddaughter tends to get bored easily and chats through movies ~ she didn't say a word. My 13 and 12 yr old granddaughters loved the other Tinkerbell movies but this was when they were a few years younger. I was hesitant to purchase as I did not think they would watch more than once at best. Instead, I rented through Amazon Instant Videos. The movie streamed perfectly and got 3 \\"mini critic\\" rave reviews. They said this was the best Tinkerbell movie of them all. Looks like I will have to purchase after all.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I cannot say enough wonderful things about this album - it is absolutely fantastic.  Every song just brings a magical feeling.  On \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\"  Susan's voice brings chills all over my body and tears to my eyes, especially when she hits those beautiful high notes.  I have been a fan from the minute I first heard her and have all of her albums, but this album is by far the bestest!  Susan is AWESOME!!!!!
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I must preface my review with this:  I am not a huge fan of this genre. I watched this movie because I felt the low reviews were misguided. I am a fan of Harrison Ford, and I believed that he would not be involved in a low-grade movie.<br /><br />I was correct. This is an outstanding romantic comedy! It is what instant classics are made of. McAdams, Ford, Keaton and crew are stellar. You will laugh and you will cry; not sad tears but happy tears. I don't believe in spoiling the movie so I will leave this a brief review void of spoilers. I will state that if you are looking for an even-headed comedy, an entertaining movie with well-developed characters that quickly draw you into the story; this is an excellent choice. I highly recommend it for anyone who likes this genre.<br /><br />A word on genre: this is a romantic comedy. It is not raw, stand-up comedy. It is not today's raunchy comedy - laced with toilet and drug humor. If you want THAT, skip THIS. You are better served with BALLS OUT, THE HANGOVER or perhaps PINEAPPLE EXPRESS. I feel that some of the low-end reviews here are due to the confusion some people have about comic genres.<br /><br />There were a few laugh out loud moments. If you can, watch it with someone you love.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Thanks for reading my review. I trust it was helpful to you in making a quality decision.<br />Rob

B001M5UDGS|4.0|Dr. Horrible's Evil Quest<br /> Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog was an innovative take of the traditional good vs. evil movie. This movie was written and produced by Joss Whedon. Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog is a low budget film so the effects are not outstanding, but there are many other aspects that more than makes up for anything that the movie may be lacking. My first take on the movie was that it was corny but as I watched I found myself hardly able to contain my laughter. There were a lot of subtle connotations in the movie which I enjoyed interrupting. Neil Patrick Harris plays Billy also known as Dr. Horrible who is a wannabe villain that has a need to be esteemed by Penny and Bad Horse.  Penny is played by Felicia Day; she has captured Billy's heart. Billy and Penny use the same laundry mat.  Billy has been infatuated with Penny for what seems like a long time.  Bad Horse is considered the \\"thoroughbred of sin\\" and is the leader of the evil league of evil. On the quest to enter in to the evil league of evil Dr. Horrible has to make choices between Penny or his evil plans. Through his evil plans we meet Captain Hammer who is considered Dr. Horrible's nemesis. Captain Hammer is the hero for the city, with that said he is very arrogant. During one of Dr. Horrible's evil plans Captain Hammer saves penny. By saving Penny Captain Hammer then wins her affections. So there is an interesting love triangle that in tangles it's self in the movie. Dr. Horrible's evil plans don't always turn out the way he expects them to, but he desperately wants to be associated with the evil league of evil. I enjoyed the musical feature of the movie as well. The songs were meaningful and had comic flares to them. The actors did an awesome job with the vocals .The movie is simply a terrific story that is unusual, but funny with the elements of love and passion. I disliked the ending at first but I did like what it stood for. You can interpret it in many different ways but I took it to mean every path has its puddle and what we want can come with a great price.
0385535147|1.0|I finished this book but barely. I truly believe you could give someone a crayon and bottle of wine and they could do better than this. It's a shame because it started off mildly well but then dissolved into a confused boring implausible shamble. If you are contemplating buying this book walk into a book store and read the authors note at the end, it sums up his attitude towards his \\"writing\\"process extremely well, and the fact that a publisher let that comment appear says something about them as well. A truly awful book, it saddens me to see it at the top of the NYT bestseller list. You should also read the very last line of the book, if any awards are won by this book it should be for having the worst laziest most sophomoric last line of any book of 2012.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love when books get you right up to the boudary of feasibility without crossing over into complete fantasy land.  This book achieves that in my opinion.  The pace is quick, the action great, and the ruthlessness of Rapp still on full display.  Really enjoyed this one as I have the previous 12 Mitch Rapp stories.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is great storyteller with one of my favorite characters in John Corey, a irreverent hero with great one liners.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I Have watched Walking Dead from the beginning. It is awesome with wonderful acting.  I especially like Andrew Lincoln.  His acting is believable in the story, he has sacrificed his life for the group.  I don't like David Morrisey's character but it is good acting if you don't.  I'm sorry to see Lori gone, that show was emotional for me.  I hope that Rick survives with his humanity and love for his two children.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|It would be so easy for a band, fifteen years between albums, to lose all their purpose, cohesion and meaning. Soundgarden have managed to retain all three, and have delivered a wealth of terrific material. Concise, heavy riffing and time signature playfulness return here, and their pre-grunge quasi-psychedelia makes welcome cameos throughout this ambitious album.<br /><br />C. Cornell's vocal delivery seems more grounded than ever, all while soaring towards pitch altitudes last visited during Bush Snr's administration. K. Thayil's pull-off and hammer-on riffing has an all new context, and the catchy, condensed licks are real features of the album (again, recalling BadMotorFinger's greater moments).<br /><br />While we've heard heavier phrases from the band, there is a synergy here that was never captured on previous releases (and eras). The band are certainly in-step with one another, and it is very easy to take M. Cameron's exquisite and technically astounding drumming for granted. This alone is a new level of greatness for the band. B. Shepherd again, occupies the regions between rhythmic and melodic purpose; visiting the lower registers of his instrument more than I've ever noticed. (Though the trademark tenor-range riffing and runs return where required).<br /><br />Consistency is where the band lives - we see a real follow-through from the opening to the closing, and we never feel that we're experimenting along with the band (as Superunknown tended to do) - we feel like they have given us the best they have, in the best manner they can give it. And who can ask for anything more?
B000002LQS|5.0|I'm obsessed with RHCP and have been obsessively infatuated with them since age 8. And last week I was wondering why I own every freakin' RHCP album except 'Blood Sugar Sex Magic', which is actually my FAVORITE album. So I ordered it and I just got the cassette format in the mail today. Literally, the mail man walked up to my door and I grabbed it out of his sweaty, postal hands. Just now.<br /><br />It's long over due, but finally I can listen to 'Blood Sugar Sex Magic' in the comfort of my own room, my own car, my bathroom, whatever. I can play it loud and proud.<br /><br />My personal little tidbit: Of course all the well-known classic tracks are played first, like 'Under the Bridge' and \\"Suck My Kiss\\". Followed by the less popular, but awesome tracks such as \\"Little Miss Lover\\" and \\"Funky Monks\\". (Oh my gosh, my heart is wilting with joy just thinking about that song.) And I must not forget the rest of the songs, which are all equally amazing. But the sick tracks that will inevitably be played repeatedly are 'Sir Psycho Sexy' and \\"Breaking the Girl.\\"<br /><br />This is a classic album that makes me happy.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Not much to say except that it works as advertised. Easy to install and set up.<br />You know you have entered geekdom when get excited about being able to print<br />from your kindle from bed on a lazy Sunday morning.
B008EG700U|4.0|I discovered Jens Lekman about 3 years ago on an experimental, musical journey into the Swedish Community. Man, this guy is good. Unconventionally good. I just recently bought this Vinyl and cannot stop putting it on repeat. Lekman's music is melodic, minimalistic, and simple...yet it has so much depth and movement. I'm always so eager to talk to fellow music lovers about Jens Lekman and all his glory.<br /><br />Favorite songs from this album: 'Erica America' and 'I Know What Love Isn't'.<br /><br />As a Swedish song writer, Jens Lekman has a better grasp of the dynamics of the English language than many American song writers today. This sort of music is not everyone's style. It honestly took me a while to get used to him, but just give it a listen. It's enlightening and endearing and everything nice.
B009JZPH32|5.0|An amazing film. When you think the movie is over, well, it isn't and that's a shame. The alternate ending should've been saved for the dvd extras.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a great book and great story.  My eyes are tired but I could not put it down.  I wonder if we will hear more of Mr. Grey and his Ana.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Amazing book I recommend to all ages it is hilarious! Awesome book you cant beat it get it now you won't be disappointed!
B005QI4TP8|1.0|Based on the reviews, I felt that I HAD to listen to this CD.  Well, I finally did, and I hated it!  I told myself I would listen all the way through, and maybe suddenly it would \\"click\\".  It got worse and worse.  Why?  Well, I found it to be overwrought, grating (to the extreme), over-dramatic, and just plain terrible.  The vocals are so danm annoying I wanted to scream.  I could go on, but enough already.  This is horrible.  Absolutely HORRIBLE.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wasn't able to put it down since I started reading it. Loved the book. It was a great sci-fi that seemed very realistic and the character development was superb. I have been recommending this book to everyone
B00884GR0W|4.0|good game and that's all i have to say about this AMAZING MASTERPIECE..... V.  Vgc f f.  cccfgcgyg ghh. vhvggui vvvy
1476715904|5.0|I read this book in a day! It was believable, funny, sad, heartwarming, and most of all I felt what the characters were feeling!  I highly recommend this book to anyone!  The one reviewer said that they had a hard time believing that this book could be so great (5 stars) so quick!  It's a great book!  It's available in Ebook, so one can receive it instantly!  I recommend it and its sequel!
B000X418UO|4.0|This movie is one of our favorites. When we purged our old VHS collection this is one we mourned. Along with The Rock, we decided to purchase them in blu ray since we missed watching them. We enjoyed watching it a few days after it arrived and plan on watching it again soon. This movie is a classic and one of Nick Cage's best.
B009MO5E10|4.0|\\"I almost got killed 3 times in the last 20 min and it wasn't my fault.\\" Wilee (Gordon-Levitt) is a bike messenger in Manhattan. It is one of the most dangerous jobs you can have but he is the best at what he does. When he is given an envelope to deliver he thinks it's just another job. After being confronted by Bobby Monday (Shannon) about it Wilee begins his delivery, but not everyone wants to see him succeed. I have to admit that I was not really looking forward to this going in. I though, how good can a movie about a guy who rides a bike be? While this is not amazing it is a pretty tense and exciting action movie. The race scenes are fun to watch and seeing how Wilee comes up with his routes is interesting to see. I'm not saying this is really something to rush (get it) out and see but it's not one to pass up if you get the chance. Overall, very entertaining and fun to watch. Just a good popcorn type movie where you don't really have to think. Those are good sometimes. I say B+.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It is so easy to stay orginized I love this app it is easier then caring around a note pad when. you have one just a click away.<br />It will let you do things your own way like having your notes sorted color or alphabetical, any way you think it is easier.
B007L24T52|1.0|very disappointed with his style of writing.<br />I purchased the book as it listed as a best seller.<br />lesson learnt.
076790592X|5.0|I read this book as extra credit for my high school English class. I figured it looked like a quick easy read and I really needed the 20 extra points. I hate to admit that it took a grade incentive to make me read a book but I sure am glad that I did. It is an incredible story that everyone can relate to and learn from. What really affected me was that this was a true story based on the Tuesdays Mitch Albom spent with his dying history professor. Mitch, like so many of us today, was caught up in his career and the fast pace of life and it wasn't until he spent some time with Morrie that he remembered what is important about living. I like that Morrie's wisdom was displayed simply, simple words with simple meanings but things that everyday people do not think about. Even though the book timelines a man's death it really is all about living and how to live so you can be at peace with dying. This is a book that will always be a treasure  for me and that I enjoy sharing with others.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|Sorry but I refuse to be ripped off like this, Why on earth would they release the cut versions thinking people will buy? I won't be buying this version only for Warner to release a \\"special extended edition box set\\" in a years time.<br /><br />Warner should have followed the example of the release of Star Trek TNG on bluray, where every episode has been remastered with new effects and extended bit cut in.
B008PE9GSA|1.0|I am in general agreement with many of the 1-star reviews for this album. There is no stand-out tune on the record and every song sounds a lot like all the others. Why didn't they just record a single 36-minute track? A true disappointment. If this is their best, then they should refrain from making any further studio recordings and just stick to live performances only (they'll make more money that way anyway).
B00633W614|4.0|Jeffrey Archer tell a story of a place and a time many may not have known. The characters are well portrayed and the story moves along beautifully with surprises at every turn.<br /><br />Recommended for all adults and mature adolescents.  Can't wait for the sequel.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|Jellyflop is a cute little game about a jellyfish who wants to fly. Maybe not worth 2.99, but as a free app of the day, I bought it and after playing for almost half an hour, I must admit it can get hard. It is really fun. Four stars!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|This sounds great right away, but has grown so much every time I listen to it.  I highly recommend this for purchase, it's well worth the money.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Stellar movie with seasoned actors and humorous story line. Well worth the time. Great holiday movie that could be viewed by family. Recommend!
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|great eye candy. good music. Kind of old school style. better to watch this stuff in blue-ray than dvd. go blue-ray
B008BM9L72|1.0|I've read better edited copy on the back of a cereal box. Bad, bad, bad!a few days of my life I'll never get back. Plus I never want to read the following words EVER again. Taciturn, beguiling, apex, undone, just F$&@$& hair...ah, so many words ruined for me. This book was beyond ordinary.
0767821629|1.0|We saw a portion of this movie on TV and really wanted to see the whole movie so we bought this one as it was very cheap in the amazon listings.<br />If we had any idea how damaged it would be upon arrival, we never would have started this whole thing. They should have thrown it out instead of offering it up for sale.<br />Yes, they gave us a refund but it did not remove the disapointment after waiting 2 weeks for it to arrive and the additional upset of screwing around with the DVD as we tried to find a way to watch it.<br /><br />I would have paid much more to just have a copy of the movie that worked. Period.<br />So I will never use this seller again as they probably have other cheap DVD's for sale that are trash. I do not want to go through the whole emotional roller coaster again. They are not worth the risk.<br />Just getting a refund was not enough, there is no satisfaction in this at all.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show! The second season has sucked so far though, so I think I'm going to stop watching. But for those of you who loved AHS season 1 as much as I did, go watch Game of Thrones; it's the only show that tops this one!
B007VTVG4C|5.0|I don't consider this minimal at all as most do. The large field of dynamics bring out the immense harmonically dissonant tones. This in combination with her immensely schizophrenically brilliant lyrics and bipolar emotions makes the soundscape larger than life. It may be my favorite album of the year, and my tastes generally graze in far different fields.
0449011909|5.0|This was by far my favorite Song of Ice and Fire book yet! I admit I'd never heard of GRRM before HBO's Game of Thrones, but the books are SOOO much better than the show; you really get to know and love and hate the characters! I have a long commute, so I listen to audiobooks to keep me company, and I think this is the best voice actor I've heard. Definitely buy if you're already considering!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is fun but it dosent update at the same time a a ipod but it is still fun and from the title i am not saying  it is horibl i am saying not for people that dont like games that take time
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My 8 year old daughter immediately wanted to see this movie once Disney started showing the trailer. She received it as a birthday gift to view on her Kindle Fire and has been watching it ever since. It is a beautiful movie to watch, the colors of Pixie Hollow are so vibrant! I must admit that the title song \\"The Great Divide\\" is a great song and we all sing along every time. This is a great buy for the family!
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I am surprised that I had never read this before now.  I have fallen in love with the Dune Universe through the movies and identify with Paul Atreides so much with the regards to the relationship with his father and the loss of his birthright. Anyone who has lost their father at an early age coupled with more tragedies after will know what I mean.  This book still amazes me at how meaty it is.  When I told several of my friends that I was reading this book, they were amazed I would take on such an opus.  The only downside is not about the book, but the electronic format for eReaders.  There is a lot of typo's throughout the book and became a distraction at times.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was unlike any other book I have read !  I was really intrigued after seeing a whole bunch of people reading this while I was on vacation. It took me a day and a half to finish it because I was so anxious to figure out how all the events in the book took place and why! its really a crazy book. If you like suspense books and figuring out mysteries than this is the book for you. This was a new author for me so I look forward to reading more from Gillian Flynn.
B0017MO10U|3.0|It was an interesting spin on an alternate time-line; however, it isn't a movie that I would watch over and over again.  I must say I was a little disappointed. The upside of the movie is there is closure on one of the longer running story lines.
B0024396WE|5.0|This movie deserves all the academy awards it has received, This is a sequel (or a sister) movie to Schindler's List, it has the same devastating, suspenseful quality. A movie you will never forget.<br />Highly recommended.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|It was nice to finally have closure on the story arc.  Stargate is one of my all time favorite shows and the movie was well done.  There were some parts that were campy, but I could overlook that because I have enjoyed this characters for a number of years.
B00A12VW86|5.0|If you are buying Dos expecting an old-school Green Day experience, you are severely mistaken. Dos is some of the best Green Day since American Idiot, and that's saying a lot. Given, I was a bit disappointed by both 21st Century Breakdown and more so by Uno. Dos feels new and fun. If you listened to Green Day's other project, the Foxboro Hottubs, it's very similar to that. Some people may hate this, mainly the guys who keep asking for an album like Dookie, but to each their own. Dos is very simple rock, and if you are curious into seeing Green Day try something new and different, buy this. If you enjoy 60s rock, buy this. If you want to listen to good music, BUY THIS. The only real complaint I have is with the song Nightlife. It's really strange and different (in a bad way), and sounds like this slow funeral march. It's about sex and stuff (lots of songs about this topic, so if it's not your thing, I don't know what to tell you) In my opinion, the best songs are Amy (a nice little sad song in dedication to Amy Winehouse.), Ashley (This one surprised me. I don't really like the way it starts but the chorus is insanely awesome and gets much better from there) and Lazy Bones (Very very good. Lyrics are like a hybrid of Longview and Basket Case. Nice.). Some people are hating on this cause it's not really in Green Day's nature to do something like this, but I love it and am anxiously waiting for Tre.
B003V5HWWA|5.0|The music brought back a lot of memories for me.  I miss these types of cartoon movies of this quality!  My daughter is 4 and got a little scared at the beginning and didn't like Jaffar, but she did enjoy the music.
141659521X|4.0|If they keep charging more for the Kindle version than for the paperback, I am going to download for free.
B0009IW88A|5.0|I never tire listening to the music.  When I first watched the movie, I was truly surprised to learn that it was Hans Zimmer.  Excellent job and would recommend to anyone who loves to listen to movie soundtracks!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I hated it at first, thought he was a sick man but enjoyed it.made me cry at times. Can't wait to read the next book.
B0087HT36U|4.0|This game is fun. I like the History references. It is a nod to other games. What isn't? This is more original.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|This album is a major step up from the first. All the songs are great and I can listen to the whole record without feeling the need to skip a song. The voices, lyrics and music have all improved so much. Its defiantly worth the price!
B0098VXE50|4.0|I found this movie to be an interesting adaptation of the fairy tale. However, I would have liked to see the relationships developed more. The characters seemed a little flat.
0380789035|2.0|A much better and funnier take on forgotten gods is Douglas Adam's The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul. I found it hard to read Gaiman's book without thinking that he stole the main plot points of Adam's book, and added a lot more fluff and sex to pad it out.
B00846REIS|4.0|Similar to Fifty Shades of Gray. Kept my interest. Loved the characters. Already preordered the next one.  Highly recommend this series for a light read.
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|The Beatles music is five stars the vinyl is not. My original Abbey Road vinyl from 1969 in almost mint shape. Got my 2012 new Abbey Road remaster. I don't think the sound is that much better than my original album. Good turn table and receiver. I can hear a few pops and noise on some tracks, not bad but this is a new record. This copy is the 180g vinyl. I have other new vinyl that is clear sounding.  I have bought five remastered records, Let It Be, The Beatles, and Abbey Road and they all have some problem with noise, pops ect on each LP. Look close at the record and you can see the marks on the vinyl. Plus dirt or dust on them and ruff edges. Rubber Soul and Sgt. Pepper are perfect. Will wait to buy the rest of the releases.  Hope EMI and Capital fix these problems.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I dont understand how this book had so many good reviews. It's so boring and I'm barely even 5% into it (kindle). I can't stand it. I feel like the author is trying to prove himself because he keeps using ridiculous words. Also, there's no real timeline, so I had no idea who the first character was or who the Maori were initially. I have a bachelors degree, but Im not a history person. Maybe i missed something; maybe the author explained everything good. Right now, I would rather watch paint dry than read this book. I was so excited about it because it was made into a movie, and now I'm just annoyed I spent money on it.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I believe for girls this is a must read/ watch. This one though was actually a gift to someone so I can't judge how it worked.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book.  Still reading on my Kindle, but, having trouble putting it down and I have company coming Saturday for Thanksgiving.  Need to clean house, buy groceries, run errands and all I want to do is read.....  O.K. here it is 10:25pm<br /> and I just finished the book.  John Grisham should be put in time out for writing a book that the reader has trouble laying down.  lol  Now in the morning, I will be able to get my work finished before the company arrives.
0448060191|5.0|Does this need a review?  Classic story, classic book, classic classic classic.  got it for my niece, a book every young person should read.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I was looking for something to read and a co worker said that this was a great read.  I was hooked after the first few accounts of the zombie war.  I have never heard of Max Brooks, but would read him again.  I like the war the story is pieced together from different perspectives, and geographical locations.  At first, you may find it difficult to follow the event, but it all comes together pretty quickly as episodes are filled in on the war spread.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in zombies, kinda a requirement, and anyone looking for a fun, quick read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The BBC has done it again!  This is a well cast, well written and well directed mini-series on a par with Brideshead Revisited.  Well worth the time it takes to watch.  We look forward to season 3.
B003O86FMW|4.0|You have to love a little romance, a little sci fi and some good old conflict.  While it is centered around teens, this disturbing series is well tuned for adults.  Especially adults with children.  You can't help but continue to turn the pages in order to find out what Collins has in store for Katniss and the rest of her characters.<br /><br />There are many lessons in this modern approach to the plot that are good for the teen reader.  However, the young readers need to be monitored.  My daughter was very disturbed after watching the movie adaption and we would not allow her to read the book as of yet.  I found it very entertaining.<br /><br />The conclusion of this book will leave you wanting for more.  I'm glad that I read the series in their entirety, and did not have to wait for the next book.  Awesome job to Suzanne Collins, and I would highly recommend this easy read to anyone that is interested in a furturistic, yet believable take on things to come.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|The Film had a life lesson but it was awfully slow and nothing exiting to keep U interested. The setting was beautiful but the film was nothing special.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Being a total Steve Jobs non-supporter I resisted reading this book for the longest time because I could not accept that I do admire him.  Isaacson hits a home run once again writing about another figure that helped shape the way we live today.  Love him, hate him, or not even knowing who he is Steve Jobs has changed the way we do things each adn every day.<br /><br />This book is a great insight into the man and his ideas, or should I say ideas that he helped polish....lol.  After reading this book you will have a better understanding of not only Jobs, but Apple and how it has become one of the most successful companies today.  There is a good contrast of Jobs/Apple and Gates/Microsoft.<br /><br />And what book about Jobs would not be complete unless Woz is involved?  Being one of Jobs' closest circles early on we are enlightened how this relationship played out over the decades, and why Jobs would never be who he was without Woz, and Woz without Jobs.<br /><br />This book is not just for the techy or geek.  It is a book for anyone interested in a facinating individual that will hold you hostage at times, make you cry at another, and yet sake your in disbelief more often than not.<br /><br />Apple fans, this is a must read!  Haters, this is a must read, cause he can teach us all a little something about why we dislike him.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0007107927|5.0|This book is short lessons on how do deal with management issues.  Our daughter is new to management, so we got this book for her.  Both my husband and myself have profited from reading this book in the past.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|had fun with this app. could. not put it down till I had played threw. looking forward to the next one.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Rick Riordan has yet to disappoint his readers with this book. I love how he builds bridges between concepts. As all of his other books, it is worth the time and price.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Watched the movie twice in the theaters and pre-ordered this. There are tons of special features with a lot of detail on the whole filming process, story concept, illustrations and much more. You definitely get your moneys worth, there is a lot of other neat things like how they interviewed for the crew for prometheus. The interview is in character and not real life,  lots of other quirky things. There hasn't been a good sci-fi movie in a while, even though there are a lot of things in this movie that is scientifically wrong it's still enjoyable to watch. Looking forward to the sequel of this.
0061743526|5.0|I appsolutely adore this book! It tells such a life changing story, that really gives you insight on life. This book is the reason I fell in love with reading in the first place and I have continued reading it numerous times over the years! This story will never bore me or stop bringing out my emotional side. I hope this books continues to inspire for the next 50 yrs plus many many more!

0141195851|2.0|The book was loose in the box with no protective sleeve. Since it was a white cloth cover it picked up a decent amount of dirt.<br />I managed to erase a good deal of it but there is still a little discoloration. Also some of the pages were bent due to shipping.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|There are two problems with this book :<br /><br />First, the author tries to tell a zombie story and to write a critique of the current state of the world at the same time. The result is he does neither of those things well. He has great ideas for his story but they would all need more work and he has put all the extra effort into informing us of his half-baked thoughts on sociology, warfare, morality, politics, religion, life, history, etc. I write \\"half-baked\\" not because I think the author is an idiot but because he paints with such a large brush, trying as he does to cover all continents and all cultures, that it could never have led to good results. I got bored of that aspect somewhere halfway through and skipped all political and social comment form that point on. He should have concentrated on the story. The social comment adds nothing to the book.<br /><br />The second problem is related to \\"suspension of disbelief\\".<br /><br />*spoiler ahead *<br />As the story progresses, you become convinced the zombies could not have multiplied the way they did in the book. The infection process is too slow (you need to be bitten), incubation too short and the symptoms too obvious (you cannot miss a zombie). It is also incomprehensible that the military cannot get a grip on a slow-moving, utterly predictable enemy.  The Yonkers episode for instance is very unrealistic. Trust a former artilleryman. There's a reason why the movie folks apparently opted for fast zombies : the book's concept will not work on screen.<br />* end of spoilers *<br /><br />The two stars are for the story which is the best part of the book. Great ideas, too bad they were not exploited to their full potential.  I didn't care for the social commentary. This is obviously not what I was looking for when I bought the book and some of it was really cheesy.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Few historical accounts, print or video, possess the depth and detail as in &#34;The World at War&#34;. A must-have for war buffs and an amazing tool for 20th century history students. Highly recommended!

1451627297|5.0|This book sees Stephen King as a very matured writer. I have probably read some 36 of his books over the years, and there was none I was looking forward to as much as this one. He said he wanted to write it in the 70s, and I'm so glad he didn't.<br /><br />What Mr. King has put together here was a very well researched book about the history of the Kennedy assassination as a time travel story, and also a good novel with heart and soul, with his protaganist Jake. Oh, I don't want to give away anything. It is just a wonderful, wonderful novel from a man who has really made his place among American novelists, and I highly recommend it.

B008220C92|5.0|This movie by the director of 'Exorcism of Emily Rose' is another that will be part of my library! A friend of mine and I went to see it, and even though the setup for a couple of scares he found predictable, both of us jolted several times. Plus by the end credits, he was pretty impressed, and I was left almost breathless. This is a reintroduction to horror when gore, language and sexual content wasn't required to make a good scary/horror film. If you're a modern horror fan, but like story and charecter development as well, check this out in theaters or on DVD/BR, you may never look at everyday things the same way again. Highly recommended! Thank you, Scott D.!  I'm not going to seperate the sequel's review. It was almost as good, even with a different director and the musical score was very similar even without Christopher Young's at the keyboard. This one only has the deputy from the original, and the storyline begins sometime after the creepy events of the first one. And he seems somewhat obsessed with the Oswalt story and all the others before it. There is an estranged couple where the mother is desperately trying to protect herself and her kids( who both run across some footage videos, of course) from her physically abusive spouse. But this guy has way too much financial power, friends around every corner and a lot of arrogance, making the viewer hope he gets his... This tells the story from the kids perspective in a very creepy way, the boogeyman song from the trailer was hardly used with wouldn't have worked for me. The creature gets a lot more screen time here and the newer victim footage is a little more graphic, but not like many slasher sequels of recent decades. Those who enjoyed the original will probably want to try this one, but don't expect an exact repeat. Let's just hope this doesn't become a multi chapter franchise...
B0055SWM08|1.0|Oh, and did i mention that I hate it. If you go to photos, you will find a video that shows someone playing the game. Very stupid game- don't think about getting it.
B000RLFJQ2|4.0|This is a classic we really enjoy watching over and over.. so had to get the Blu-Ray! The actors in this movie have made it big and when you watch this movie you will see why!
1936608618|1.0|I pre-odered this book in October and greatly anticipated its release.  After some publishing SNAFUs it was released November 12th.  Amazon will not have it in stock until November 17th, however, at least 13 reviews have appeared (all 5 stars) with several from supposed \\"Verified Amazon Purchases,\\" reviews from customers who have been verified to have purchased the book through Amazon.  I find this quite spurious considering these reviews were posted the very day the book was released and 5 days prior to Amazon's stated possession.  Amazon, you need to do a better job of providing objective reviews.  When the book finally gets here I will update my post with a proper review.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Not scary at all. Aliens was way better and scarier. Home c-section was comical and story could have been better
1400069289|4.0|The Power of Habit is an interesting journey that takes the reader through the process of how we develop personal habits and how to go about changing said habits. It also covers how habits are formed in sports and businesses, and at how habits can affect us sub-consciously. This isn't a self-help book that gives you a step-by-step guide on how to change your own habits, but you will learn how habits are formed and how they define our behavior.<br /><br />I ordered this book because I have some personal bad habits that I would like to break, but also because I thought it might be able to provide some much-needed insight for my own business. All in all, I'd say that the book was especially helpful in helping me to identify my habit loops. Now that I've finished the book, I'm going to move forward with identifying the cues and rewards that trigger and support my habit behavior and then come up with substitutes to see if I can break my habits.<br /><br />I was successful at quitting smoking in 2009 after smoking for almost 15 years, but in this particular case, I was motivated by a life-changing event and had a solid reason to do so. The habit that I want to break now will be harder. I don't necessarily want to lose weight, but I do want to change my eating habits to support a healthier style of living. I have a feeling that this is going to be really hard, but I also feel that Duhigg has put me on the right path to accomplishing my goal.<br /><br />The other thing that stood out for me with this book was how organizations like Target collect information from their customers and then use that information to entice people to shop at their stores more often. I'm going to think twice about handing out my personal information now that I know how that information is used.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Fast-paced and fun match-3 game. One of the best games I've played on kindle. Nice graphics and enough levels to keep playing for a while.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Put simply, this is a very nice cover for the Kindle Fire (first edition Fire).  It fits in it quite snugly, without wiggling around and the top stays down on it when it is closed.  The color is not a bright obnoxious red, but a maroon color that looks nice.  The interior is all black, contributing to the sleek look.  It could easily look like a real book if placed in a bookshelf.  One of the nicer looking Kindle Covers in my opinion.
B000002L1L|5.0|\\"Battle Rages On...\\", the last album with Ritchie Blackmore. Being a 90's album is, what one can conclude, the reason why fans might hate it. It is said that the lack of melodies on this album \\"infuriated\\" Ritchie, which is why he left the group during the tour of this album. First of all, I still believe this album is one of the best late 1980s - 2000s albums by Deep Purple. Its got the talent all over the album, and the classic melodies from the 70s to it. Secondly with \\"lack of melodies\\", I believe Ritchie meant the kind of melodies he created on the 80s Rainbow albums with Joe Lynn Turner, which were the Rainbow albums the fans liked the least. Ritchie's got so many solos going on this album. Oh well.<br /><br />This album is way better than \\"House of Blue Light\\", and also the good but not so classic \\"Slaves And Masters\\".<br /><br />Too bad Ritchie left, because I always thought this albums stands on top of the most of the later Deep Purple albums.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing! If you have seen the movie and you enjoyed it like I did, then you will LOVE this soundtrack!

B0053TMP24|4.0|Look I just turned 22 years old and I read mostly mature stuff. But sometimes I like to get my hands on fantasy books that are aimed mostly towards kids who are at least 10 years younger than me. You know Harry Potter, Eragon, Percy Jackson. That kinda stuff. I love it. My imagination goes wild, it makes me wish I was a part of that world which is what this book makes you feel. Riordan does a great job bringing Percy back into the equation. There is one little complaint though. The mistakes on the kindle version are to many. They need to update it. Other than that Great book.
0307949486|4.0|Interesting characters, cold and at times quirky; adequate, complex, complicated and twisted plots (way too much coffee at any one time); gripping nonetheless.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Aside from the obvious sex scenes in the book...its actually a good story.  I've grown just as attached to these characters as i have with my other FAVES (Twilight & 50 Shades)  i believe that any book that can make u feel that way about fictious people is well worth it.
B008NABUU8|5.0|This is a great game. it is very challenging at times. Many hours of fun. I definitely recommend this game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|In her name , Girl with Dragon Tattoo and now this book.... Those are the best of the best for me.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book really kept my interest throughout.  I thought it was suspensful and scary at times and included a sweet love story.  Also had a satisfying ending with a slight twist.  Loved it!!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I was exceptionally impressed by this trilogy as a whole. The Dark Knight blew most people away and set an extremely high standard for this one to meet. I don't think this film met the standard for pure intrigue set almost single-handedly by Heath Ledger in his role as the Joker. I was however very impressed by Tom Hardy's performance as Bane and loved the character. I have heard many complaints about Bane from random people, but he is well constructed and developed, and highly formidable. He is a completely different animal from the Joker, and as the original story told, was meant to be Batman's arch-nemesis. I loved this movie for many reasons, including the depth of plot and for the story itself. Like most great movies, I think that it takes multiple viewings to pick up on all of the subtleties woven into the plot. (Study it closely naysayers, depth is there.) Many people complain of gaps and plot holes, but I don't give those complaints as much credence due to the subtle points woven in. Nolan does a good job of succinctly referencing most of those issues to move the story along quickly, you just have to pay closer attention. So purely as entertainment, I think this movie is incredible and well worth multiple viewings.<br /><br />~plot spoiler alert from this point on~<br /><br />This movie is very important, culturally, in my opinion. Nolan clearly draws a lot of inspiration from our society today, and writes a lot of cultural parallels into the movie. Much of what I am referencing here is the class warfare instigated by the cries of Bane for the citizenry to take back their city. A certain portion of the population is fooled into following a certain number of Bane's henchmen (not to mention the criminals set free) under the pretenses of rights to other people's property. This may seem like a digression, but Catwoman's character is a huge part of this side of the story. She is the caught between the two sides throughout much of the movie. She begins as one whosympathizes with movement of the [storm that is coming]. As the movie progresses however, she transforms from one who agrees with the deluded occupiers, to someone actively (however unwilling and detached she tries to be) engaged in fighting alongside the rational opposition to Bane. Catwoman's character is necessary for Nolan because I believe he wanted to show the line of logic that a fence sitter could follow to go from one side to the other. The tipping point for Catwoman was after a family was unceremoniously ripped from their home and Catwoman stood looking at a photo of the family and said \\"This was someone's home...\\" to which her friend replied, \\"No, this is everyone's home.\\" She failed to buy into the propaganda machine controlled by Bane, and subsequently began to oppose those she once stood with.<br /><br />There are many more details showing cultural and societal parallels written into the movie. I won't go into any more, but in case it interests you in addition to the the movie for story's sake, watch for them. That is all, it's an incredible movie.
6305428042|5.0|Funny unscary movie.  Great for the family.  Halloween goodie.  Bette Midler is wonderful as are Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker.  Will watch it every year.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|I've been watching this show for a few seasons and think it's a fantastic show! My wife and I downloaded this pilot episode because we couldn't remember how it all started.
B009157BWU|2.0|I've seen many documentaries and this was pretty bad. The story dragged I thought more could have happened. They were cute but the preview was better than the movie the watch the preview it was the whole movie.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I'm a life long Kiss. I've stuck by them through all of the different lineups. This is a good album, wether your a Kiss fan, or a fan or classic 70's rock. This album does a good job of catching the vibe of Kiss at their pinical. It is straight forward fist in your face rock, no excuses. Being a life long fan, there is one thing that bothers me about this album. The song Outa Of This World is a good song, but it makes me angry. This is the second time they have had Tommy sing a song in a very Ace Frehley style. It is to much like Rocket Ride. They did the same thing on Sonic Boom with Tommy's song When Lightning Strikes, to much like Shock Me for my taste. Tommy is a good guy and this isn't slam on him, but he isn't Ace and they need to stop prenending that he is. But that is just my opinion. I'm glad that they are making new music and not just reissueing the same stuff over and over.
0879309210|3.0|Having become acquainted with Dan E.'s books and writing style I didn't feel this was worth the money to buy new and found it in a used book store instead.  I should have became suspicious with their 6 copies, but I had a coupon so good to go!<br /><br />Typical Dan writing in that you get to the end of the book, realized you spent $3000 at stewmac on tools and supplies (is he getting a commission?? he should be!), and all you know for sure is that B.B. King changes his own strings and Dan buys every file he can find.<br /><br />Getting past my sarcasm and horrible attempts at wit, there is a lot of detailed information in here.  If you wanted to start a repair business this would probably be an okay place to start after you get your loan to buy all the stuff Dan is selling here.  Tons of information on acoustic guitar repairs, but in all 13 pages of electric non-tremolo bridges you get nothing on the Tele bridge (seriously, I looked like 12 times cause I couldn't believe it).  Lots of pictures, and some of them are helpful.  Lots of history, and some of it is mildly interesting, but if you have read Guitar Player some of it might be rehash.<br /><br />It is set up in a basic, DIY, and deep format for each chapter (although some inherently skip over the lower rungs).  It would have been nice for the basic section to be more like \\"use this to do this and use that to do that\\", instead of typically giving you 50 options and never really saying that one or the other is the best for anything.  Example -- fretwire -- after almost 3 pages of details on shape, size, hardness, etc. he gives you his favorites (6), tells the basic details of each, and then says \\"you should buy samples of any wire...and check it out for yourself\\".  Yeah thanks again Dan.<br /><br />Other Considerations:  People that like to read books might or might not like this book.  People that are interested in guitars sometimes prefer books like these over others.  People that want to repair their own guitar usually end up taking it to someone else after they have been thoroughly overwhelmed with overpriced specialty tools to do every little thing imaginable that I just can't live without.  People who write reviews about this book in the style of the book will often write reviews that read like this last section -- sometimes.  Although Jorge at Fender Corona will argue otherwise -- most of the time, except when the ghost of SRV tells you to quit being a wuss and crying about 11s hurting your fingers.
B009YDAUJ0|5.0|This is yet another great installment of the walking dead.  I think Season three has recaptured some of the qualities that made season one so great (and seemed lacking in season two).
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is the easiest and most compact knife sharpener I have owned. Works great to bring my knives edges back and worked great on my serrated knives as well.
B0083VQO1W|3.0|This sneak peak got me a whole lot closer to the real premise of the movie than I was able to glean from the typical trailers.  It showed me two things:  1.  The plot was different that what the trailers led me to believe.  2. The filmography techniques were kind of annoying... Sometimes watching third person (typical fly-on-the-wall way of watching movies), but sometimes it was in the first person (via recordings)... that bugged me enough that I still haven't actually watched the whole movie.  So I think extended clips like this can help prevent you from spending monie on a digital rental for a movie you later wished you hadn't wasted money on.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|An enjoyable read that enlightened me to a different perspective on a part of US history that I knew nothing about.... Kept me interested, and enough so that it kept my interest through the first \\"powerless\\" night. I finished it by flashlight! Will definitely recommend it.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|A truly compelling classic with an even greater ending. The imagery that London uses to create the scenery from the point of view of a dog is incredible. A short read that can be done in a short amount of time. I recommend that this classic should be read in high school over the normal Shakespeare poems. Not for the weak of stomach however overall one of my favorite classics of all time. 5/5 stars here
B005LAII9O|3.0|Chon and Ben grow the best pot in America.  Actually, it's Afghani pot, smuggled in by Chon when he returns from active duty.  O, named for Ophelia from Shakespeare's Hamlet, is the girl both guys love, and she loves them both equally.  Whereas Chon brings the brute strength and security, Ben offers gentleness and stability.  They've got themselves a perfect world...until the Mexican cartels take notice and kidnap O for the smallest slight.  Now Chon and Ben have to get her back, and they're about to descend in a world of violence born in the heat of Mexico's drug violence.<br /><br />SAVAGES isn't a terrible film; don't read the 3 stars and think, \\"Wow, he hates this movie.\\"  If I hated it, I'd give it one star, maybe two if there were some genuinely awesome moments.  SAVAGES is a decent film with some great elements, mainly the supporting cast: Benicio del Torro and Salma Hayek play three-dimensional villains, while John Travolta turns in a smarmy, enjoyable performance as a corrupt DEA agent (he's always at his best when he sinks his fangs into a villainous role).  Look too for a cameo from Shea Whigham; it makes you wish he was in the movie more.<br /><br />The major problems with SAVAGES lie with the script and the directing.  The former offers the three leads little to do.  Taylor Kitsch (JOHN CARTER), Aaron Johnson (KICK ASS), and Blake Lively (THE TOWN) are all capable of delivering better performances than this.  It's just, their characters--lifted from Don Winslow's novel--are utterly two-dimensional.  One scene in particular could've let Kitsch show his range--but instead of being as powerful and effective as writers Winslow, Stone, and Shane Salerno intended, it comes off as flat and emotionless.<br /><br />That brings us to the direction.  Oliver Stone has given us some great films, both as a writer (SCARFACE) and director (WALL STREET).  Now, SAVAGES is arguably the best full movie he's made since 1999's ANY GIVEN SUNDAY; I say full because the first 2/3 of WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS were quite good (but the final third was so awful that people tend to forget that fact).  But saying SAVAGES is his best recent effort isn't saying much, considering what we're comparing it to.  Occasionally, Stone presents us with glimmers of his old self, but overall the direction is surprisingly lazy, considering this is the man who gave us the frenetically-feverish NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  It's almost as though Stone is trying to marry that film with the weirdness of his later U TURN, but the marriage is a fitful one.  Ultimately, SAVAGES doesn't come off quite as good as it could have.  It's entertaining, mostly, though the script doesn't try hard to keep your attention, and you really don't care about the fate of the three main characters.  It's a decent popcorn flick, but we expect more from Stone--though, given his recent track record, maybe we shouldn't./3 of WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS were quite good (but the final third was so awful that people tend to forget that fact).

B003F1WM2K|5.0|I can't review this book in any sort of coherent way. Patti Smith, to me, is myth, legend, genius, the soft spot in my heart contains a picture of her. She is fact and fiction and any real artist contains a bit of shaman and showman in them. I remember my NYC youth (but mine was late 80s and living across the river in JC was as close as I could afford to live to Bleeker St.)... and some of the magic of being young in a place that could be magic one minute and dangerous the next was amazing and well worth the trip. I was a poor white Jersey girl with only two Jersey heroes... Patti Smith and Bruce Springsteen. Bruce will probably never sit down and edit his journals. Patti dove deep and brought Robert Mapplethorpe back for those who knew little or nothing of his art. His portraits of her in Some Women alone show his love for his muse... I love this book and her descriptions of creating living and working spaces, kinds of tea and what clothes were her favorites on any given day... all in all, her story warms me and reminds me that every gesture and trinket found can be the beginning of an adventure.
0525478817|2.0|After reading all the wonderful reviews on amazon.com (amazon.com customers never lead me wrong), I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this book. I wish I hadn't set my expectations so high. It seems as though the author was trying too hard to make the reader sympathize with the characters. I understand the characters are young adults dealing with medicial conditions that an every day Joe cannot even begin to fathom, but I was never able to truly feel the characters and their emotions. I didn't feel engrossed in the book and I was never able to feel like I was living in the characters world - they always felt distant. I love it when books make me feel like I've left the present time and place I'm in and am now living in the world created by the author. That's the mark of a great book.<br /><br />Maybe it was just me, but I would not recommend this book. Easily forgotten......
B009CS5A42|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Nicholas Sparks has always been one of my favorite writers for his descriptive technique, but this story sucks you in and takes you to a different world. I love Zac Efron, but the movie did it no justice. This book is about their thoughts, something that cannot be conveyed in a movie. Gives you warm fuzzy feelings! :)
B008D19WBQ|5.0|I'll be one of the few folks not complaining about this set. I bought it yesterday. I watched the first four episodes already. And twelve episodes on a disc is pretty sweet (to go from 4 to 2 per season)! First of all its finally in Bluray! Picture is pretty stunning, audio sounds fantastic and it's in widescreen format unlike my standard full screen format dvd's which i will never watch again with the bluray age world. I was reading all the negative comments and i have to say that I don't personally care if the broadcast versions are whats here in these. I don't have the lines memorized anyhow so a few lines taken out here and there didn't stop me from buying this on bluray. So far i've been far from disappointed! The boxset is very nice! It contains a nice book of all the episodes, airdates and descriptions. The book of discs are beautiful in a hard protective magnetic book cover. I'm actually very impressed with the way this set was put together. And the price is very reasonable for the whole series at $150.

1608871517|5.0|This is a beautiful, touching, funny, poignant story of a 25 year friendship and working relationship.  Mr. Bush has said that he wanted to be the one to tell this story because his artistic partners, Michael Jackson and Dennis Tompkins are no longer here.  And I<br />am so glad that he did.  Beautiful garments and embellishments and stories about each work of art fill these pages.  It is so obvious how very much the author cared about his friend and client and how appreciative he was and is for the opportunity to create his iconic outfits.  I chuckled throughout at the many tidbits of insight into Michael's personality and artistic vision.  Apparently, he was particularly fond of one article and remarked to Mr. Bush...'your jacket is winkin' at me.' So, thank you Mr. Bush for this labor of love.  Just gorgeous.

B009LA1QW6|3.0|Lana Del Rey releases EP [[ASIN:B009LA1QW6 Paradise]] as both an expanded edition of [[ASIN:B009KYXEY6 Born To Die - Paradise Edition]] and as a separate EP.  Del Ray possesses quite the unique voice, but her problem has always been material, which plagued Born to Die. Paradise is ultimately not that different from Born To Die, which is both a blessing and a curse at times.<br /><br />\\"Ride\\" finds Del Rey firmly planted in her robust lower register. The chanteuse does ascend, sounding more decipherable and accurate in her higher extremes.  Produced by Rick Rubin, \\"Ride\\" balances the best of pop and alternative sensibility. Strings carry over from her enigmatic debut while the songwriting rivals the best of that album. Overall, \\"Ride\\" is enjoyable. ￼<br />\\"American\\" slackens the tempo but manages to keep the momentum strong. Lana Del Rey clings her lower register, though is more consistent as far as accuracy and sounding decipherable. \\"You make me crazy, you make me wild/just like a baby, you spin me round like a child/your skin so golden brown/beyond the dope I'm proud/Like an American,\\" she sings on the chorus.<br />Two winners in a row for Del Ray.<br /><br />\\"Cola\\" reminds the listeners of  \\"Carmen\\" from her debut, where the dark string laden production is concerned. Del Ray shocks with her opening lyric, which seems to ultimately be her desired effect.  Sensually charged, \\"Cola\\" is interesting to an extent, but by no means revolutionary or a hit.<br /><br />\\"Body Electric\\" is moody, characteristic of Del Ray.  The lyrics seem `simplistic' and somewhat ludicrous.  The main issue is that while/after listening, the listener doesn't feel truly connected with the cut. \\"Blue Velvet\\" atones as it proves a perfect match for Del Rey's unique voice.  Live strings (Larry Gold Orchestra) work well in tandem with the drum programming. \\"Blue Velvet\\" proves stronger than either \\"Cola\\" or \\"Body Electric\\" as a solid cover.<br /><br />\\"Gods & Monsters\\" quickens the pace. The theme of this song comes off a bit ambiguous, with deductions of drugs and sex very evident as possible conclusion. On the chorus, Del Rey even manages to namecheck Jim Morrison of The Doors, something confirming the liberating theme of \\"Gods & Monsters.\\" Despite such liberal fodder, \\"Gods & Monsters\\" still possesses that Lana Del Rey laid back nature, which makes it feel too lethargic.<br /><br />\\"Yayo\\" manages to showcase both the gems and quirks of Del Rey's voice, but doesn't ultimately allure. \\"Bel Air\\" closes ok, but not notably per say.  Despite being a bit too cool/bland, the use of space following each iteration of the chorus is a musical touch.<br /><br />Overall,[[ASIN:B009LA1QW6 Paradise]] should please Lana Del Rey's main constituents,  but won't necessarily quiet her skeptics.  There is still too much formulaic conception (piano, strings, lower range vocals, mysteriousness) about Del Rey's music to help her break past the celebrity of her signature breakout song, \\"Video Games.\\" Her talent is undeniable, but she needs to expand her view rather than narrowing it or maintaining the status quo.eme of this song comes off a bit ambiguous, with deductions of drugs and sex very evident as possible conclusion.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I used to watch my daughter play this game for hours and I always made comments about how she could stay on the phone playing for so long until she showed me the game. Once I started playing I downloaded it on my phone and I would play it any time I found free time and when I was going to bed I would play it and stay up for hours and at times I would have to fight with my youngest daugher because she would want to play it and I did not want to give it up. I would recommend this game to all ages.

B005ZKYXZI|5.0|Our family saw this movie in the theater when it was first released and my granddaughter loved it so much that I purchased it so she could see it again.  But I also purchased it because my husband and I enjoyed it too.  It was a different story - at times funny, at times exciting, and at times poignant.  Hugh Jackman is one of my favorites and Evangeline Lilly is one of my husband's favorites.  They both did a good job.  But they actor who played the boy was great.  We had a lot of fun with this movie.

B002IC10Y8|5.0|A lot of love and care has gone into producing this box set. It is by far the best presented box set I have ever bought, truly a collector's item. You get a gorgeously published book, too. My only comment would be that I would appreciate an additional CD-ROM.  Yo-Yo Ma is such a versatile artist/performer spanning different genera of classical music. He is quite remarkable in translating and capturing the cello voice into unique and delightful form. This set originally retailed for about $800, for under $300 it is an absolute bargain, a must have.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not just \\"plain vanilla\\" reading although not my particular taste in erotica.  Good fantasy reading with an actual storyline.  Christian is a complicated character with a storied past while the leading lady is a naive woman who stumbles upon him and the sparks start to fly. The story takes off from there:)
B001CW7MCY|5.0|I should be first said that I avoid Death Metal on principle. I can't stand when people gurgle into the microphone instead of actually singing, and when bands just randomly hit their strings and drums instead if actual playing. And when I heard that Opeth was death metal, I came close to avoiding them and letting my hatred of death metal get in the way of my better judgment. Yet my metal loving cousin managed to persuade me, as even for Death Metal, Opeth would be up my ally with the complex and maze-like guitar scales and what not. I am a huge fan of progressive rock and I figured, &#34;hmmm, guess I should finally give in!&#34;. And boy, I can say I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I remember that moment when &#34;The Leper Affinity&#34; crashed out from my headphones. The complex riffs and double bass suddenly were joined by Mikael Akerfeldt's insane growl. Typically death growls annoy me, but Akefeldt's growls were terrifying, Inhuman almost. There was so much emotion and rage in his voice, its unbelievable. Suddenly, 5 minutes in, the song takes a breather and out comes a perfect clean voice that shocks me with the revelation that it's the same singer.<br /><br />This is just a sign of how brilliant Opeth really are, and if any album is a testament to this, it is Blackwater Park. First off, this album is not for typical death metal fans who are used to their music being a maximum of 4 minutes and being all just brutality for the sake of it. This music requires you to sit down and really give it a listen. If challenges your perception of music as well, and is made for people who love to get lost in the melodies. Take for example, &#34;Bleak&#34;- in the middle when the song shifts into a dreamy and erethral acoustic passage. Or the ending, how the music gets intense and suddenly just Cuts out, as if is being played through a crappy speaker. That being said, Bleak is a fantastic song that is all of what Opeth is about. It has a catchy beat as well and feels like an adventure in one song. &#34;The Drapery Falls&#34; is a song that has so many different sounds clashing together, and in a way, it should be a mess. But Opeth manage to carefully sew them together and make something that's more than just the sum or its parts.<br /><br />The title track alone is the reason to purchase the album. At 13 minutes, the band thrash and smash their way through a rip roaring spectacle of a track that takes a few seconds to breathe, and the &#34;growl harmony&#34; near the end is unlike anything you've ever heard. Is the album always pleasant? Definitely not. But ultimately that doesn't stop the album from being an instant classic that will challenge your definition of music and will open the door to something that will ultimately sound fresh. Do buy.ture in one song. &#34;The Drapery Falls&#34; is a song that has so many different sounds clashing together, and in a way, it should be a mess.

B009NCM248|5.0|Just finished this epically mastered album which highlights the band unlike ever before on their previous efforts. House of Gold and Bones shines with exemplary, imaginative lyrics from Taylor as well with a backing of sheer domination of haunting guitar riffs, which burst in and out from melodic, to chaotic inflammation, not to undermine the backing bass and drum lines, this Stone Sour album is a must hear for more than one reason and offers fans and new fans alike an opportunity to see what this group is truly capable of. An excellent conception and definite Incarnation. The world of Rock and Alternative Metal needed an album such as this one. Check it out!

B0038LB4TE|5.0|Another Lee Child masterpiece constant action all the way through and technically accurate. Jack Reacher is a real modern and at the same time old fashioned hero.
B002R27J1W|5.0|This is a very well done film. Audrey, as always, is superb. Thrilling suspense, dramatic irony, no curse words, only a few scenes with very small smears of blood on hands or clothing, no nudity (one scene shows quite a bit of breast cleavage), minimal violence (all wounding and or killing is done in a hidden manner that old movies are good at). The only drug references are in the opening scene. Even though the entire plot revolves around obtaining smuggled heroine, it isn't talked about after the first mention. It's not a drug movie. It's suspense, smart, thrilling, with a resolution that doesn't leave you hanging. Audrey is convincing as a blind woman. She is vulnerable enough to make you want to jump into the scene and protect her. Yet, she's sharp enough and brave enough to make you feel like a loyal fan, rooting for her victory with every smart move she makes. Every character is on point, all maneuvering together - appearing and disappearing at all the right moments, weaving the story into an increasingly thrilling experience until it is over (which is when I noticed the tension in my muscles and my facial expression finally relaxing). It really sucks you in. Good old fashion suspense movie, no garbage that is in films today, my kind of film!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I don't ask much of a book. I just want a great story with great characters. This book (and almost all of DeMille's) meet that criteria every single time.

B005LAIIHG|5.0|Wow, this has been an exciting fall for literary adaptations!  I read Yann Martel's Life of Pi a decade ago and thought it was fantastic storytelling.  I cheered when it won the Man Booker Prize.  So, I was quite excited to attend an advance screening recently with several members of my book group.  I remembered the novel quite well in broad strokes, but not the fine detail.  I didn't refresh my memory before watching the film, but was curious enough to reread Life of Pi in its entirety before writing this review.  The film is very true to the novel in spirit and tone, but there are small changes, additions (generally positive), and elisions (some noteworthy).<br /><br />The film opens similarly to the novel.  The idea is the same, but the execution is slightly different.  Different mediums require different storytelling tools.  For instance, I believe most film-goers will readily recognize The Writer (portrayed by actor Rafe Spall, who replaced a distractingly famous Toby Maguire) as a stand-in for author Martel.  In the novel, it is Martel himself, in direct address to readers, who fulfills this role, effectively blurring the line between fact and fiction.  It is established that this story is being related to The Writer by an older Pi.  From there, readers are introduced to a young Piscine Molitor Patel and the world he inhabits.  It's a charmed childhood, being raised at the Pondicherry Zoo amongst a loving family and exotic animals--an Indian \\"We Bought a Zoo.\\"  These scenes are as lush and colorful as any Bollywood musical.<br /><br />I've discussed this novel with other readers countless times over the years.  It's beloved by many, but truly hated by a vocal minority.  I've never understood the vitriol, personally.  Martel writes beautifully and accessibly.  His story is fast-paced and yet deeply rooted in character.  And it explores the boundless subject of faith through an extraordinary tale--a \\"story to make you believe in God.\\"  But one complaint I've heard from readers is frustration over (or lack of interest in) Pi's religious explorations early in the novel.  The young man is a practicing Hindu, Christian, and Muslim.  Martel never belabored the point, but those readers will be gratified to see that director Ang Lee has streamlined the beginning of the tale to move more swiftly to the meat of the story.<br /><br />And that comes about when Pi's family packs up their lives, their animals, and moves the whole kit and caboodle to Canada by ship.  Well, that's the plan.  Something goes wrong in rough seas outside of Manila.  The ship goes down in a haunting scene, and now the stage is set.  Sixteen-year-old Pi is shipwrecked in a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a 450-pound adult Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  It's survival of the fittest on the high seas, and things get Darwinian fast.  Soon enough, it's Pi and Richard Parker in it together.<br /><br />When I first heard the premise of this novel, somehow I thought Richard Parker would be some kind of cute, anthropomorphized tiger, and oversized puddy tat.  He was not.  He was a terrifying predator, and he stayed a terrifying predator, throughout Pi's ordeal.  This was much the same in the movie (although not quite to the degree as in the novel, a change commented upon by Martel in the Hollywood Reporter).  Richard Parker was scary in the book, but he was terrifying on the screen.  I flinched as he snarled and lunged in 3D.<br /><br />From here, both novel and film take on an episodic or picaresque quality.  The film is delightfully dream-like from its opening frames.  (An early scene of the swimming pool from which Pi derives his name enchanted me!)  But as the days at sea pass, and the ribs of both animals become plainly visible, the film shifts from dream-like to hallucinatory.  Episodes and encounters become increasingly extraordinary.  Sitting in the audience, I could clearly discern who had read the novel and who had not by the gasps andexclamations.  (Among my friends, the film was enjoyed equally by those who had read the book and those who had not.)<br /><br />Yes, there are episodes that are missing from the film, one of which is quite notable.  Fans may miss it.  And, yet, I can understand the choices made.  Cuts were judicious.  As noted earlier there are a few small shifts and changes.  But this is a very faithful adaptation of Martel's novel, and I suspect it will please most fans of the original.  What is lost is more than made up for by how Ang Lee has brought Martel's fantastic vision to life.<br /><br />The cinematography and design of this film is exquisitely beautiful.  I'm not a huge fan of 3D technology, but once in a while it seems to really augment a film.  Such is the case here--all the better to experience a small boat on the vast ocean.  And while we're on the subject of technology, the CGI work on the tiger is seamless.  None of us could detect where the real tiger ended and the computer-generated beast began.  I have heard that young Suraj Sharma never once filmed with the live animal.  For safety, their scenes were filmed separately.  And I don't know how much footage was of a real cat.  All I can say is that the illusion is extraordinarily believable.  That a first-time actor could give such a convincing performance playing opposite an imaginary tiger is doubly impressive.  The success of the film lies firmly on Sharma's moving portrayal of 16-year-old Pi, but the supporting performances were equally strong.  It was Spall's response to Pi's story at the end of the film that actually gave me chills.<br /><br />I've been circumspect about revealing specifics of the plot.  I'll leave all the surprises of Pi's voyage intact for those new to the tale.  And readers of the novel can see for themselves what made the cut.  About the ending...  Those who have read the novel know what to expect.  Now film-goers can join the debate we've been having for the past decade.  In the end, it truly is all about faith.

0060930349|4.0|Paul Johnson is a conservative historian who is a serious scholar. His history is definitely partisan in spots. However, he backs most of his assertions with a solid backing of facts. Johnson covered a variety of subjects in this ambitious work. He covered cultural, political, social, and artistic topics in the book. Johnson comes across as an erudite intellectual and a respected member of the academic commuinty.<br /><br />Johnson is not someone who blindly accepts common interpretations of historical figures. He is an independent figure who departs from conservative orthodoxy from time to time. He presents important presidents like Calvin Coolidge in a more positive light than many liberal scholars. This counteracts the hatchet-job that some radical left wing historians engage in during some evaluations.<br /><br />Johnson's assertions before 1960 are more credible than his commentaries of more recent times. He is more willing to editorialize when it comes to evaluating the events of recent decades. That being said, Johnson is a serious historian, his scholarship is generally sound, and he points out some interesting facts that are often ignored and neglected by liberal and conservative historians alike. His books are worth reading, although the reader may not embrace all of his conclusions along the way.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I purchased The $100 Startup on my Kindle and although I have bookmarked multiple pages, I will be purchasing a hard copy as well, so it will be close at hand with lots of sticky notes for references. Anyone starting a business should read this book - it shows that anyone can start a business, if you have the desire. I'm currently rewriting a book on entrepreneurship and will be including The $100 Startup as a resource.<br /><br />Awesome book!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Before I purchased it, I did read the reviews and mostly everyone was continually comparing it with Harry Potter. WEll, this is not Harry Potter. It's adult contemporary fiction, and very good fiction at that. The story kept me interested all the way through, I stayed up a few nights reading into the wee hours. If you love a good book about a lot characters intertwined in a intimate setting, you will like this book. I defintely have and will reccomend to others. Do not however buy this book if you are strictly a fan of Harry Potter type books only. It is the same author but has nothing to do with it. It surprised me how many people bought this book than voiced their dissapointment about how unlike Harry Potter this book is.
B002APU580|5.0|Love love love this movie! Would watch it over and over. Has been one of my favorites since it came out. Played beautifully on my Kindle Fire.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|It's great though as it holds my camera, my long zoom lens, micro lens and two other lenses - 35 to 100 and 75 to 300mm. It also holds my smaller intant camera as well as my pocket video recorder. I strap my tripod on the side. There is extra room for spare batteries, keys, cell phone etc. Well worth the money -

B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I was really disappointed. I thought this would be like the original game. Instead its just another farmville / frontierville type of game.,
B007REV4T8|5.0|After the disappointing Quantum of Solace and reading in 2008 that the new Bond project was placed on the shelves due to the global credit crisis, I honestly thought that we would be seeing the end of James Bond.  When I first heard about Skyfall, I figured that the movie would be a half hearted attempt to recapture Bond's glory days but I am very happy to say that I was completely wrong.  This was one of the best movies in Bond history.<br /><br />Skyfall was much longer than other previous Bond films, however, the time flew by.  After the movie was finished, the audience actually stood up and gave the movie a standing ovation.  It is well worth the money to buy some tickets to watch this film!!
0439023513|5.0|Great book.  I read all the them and hated to see them end, but that's the way it goes.  No need to give a long detail of the book, if you've read the others, you will read this one!!!

B007HACDLK|5.0|I circle the date on my calendar when a Vince Flynn novel is due.  The wait is always worth it.  This time was no exception.<br /><br />An intelligence asset in Pakistan goes missing from a safe house.  Rapp and his team are called in to assess the damage and find Joe Rickman, the missing operative.  Rickman is a high value target - he knows names, dates and places and has planned many of the undercover operations against terrorist groups.  Director Kennedy fears the fallout of Rickman's capture and resulting damage to her intelligence network.  But even before Rapp can launch an investigation all hell breaks loose on the ground in Pakistan.<br /><br />'The Last Man' is vintage Flynn - Mitch is front and center of an action packed, tension filled story.  Things are never quite as they are portrayed.  The writing is as good as the story, confrontations between Mitch, Kennedy and the bad guys du jour is worth the price.  The current events aspect is so real you wonder how Flynn gets so close to the terrifying truth.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND

I cant wait for walking disaster come out to get Travis point of view.

The photography is magnificent - the special effects are undeniably incredible - the costumes are perfect - the actors were chosen perfectly - and the writing is unique to Snow White.  A different - darker version, but it all works so well.  Beautifully filmed.
0345529057|5.0|I have read the books and now I am anxiously waiting for the new season to begin next year. Not only is the writing well thought out, but the imagination needed to create such an intricate plot is mind blowing. Each character is so unique and well developed. My favorite is the \\"imp\\"- by far the most clever and intriguing actor in the series. I highly recommend the books to anyone who truly appreciates a good sci-fi fantasy.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I use a Kindle Fire and have been playing the game since day 1. Have no issues with gameplay and the cute Star Wars birds make this game fun to play! I checked to see why people were stating you had to pay for an extra level, but I don't see it.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|A couple slow spots but for the most part I enjoyed the book and read some really funny parts out loud to my wife.
B008476HBM|3.0|Overall, this novel was a good read. However, it lulled in many places and a lot of determination was required to finish this novel. I am pleased I did though, as the ending was very well written and the portrayal of characters by Austen (particularly Elizabeth and Darcy) were very captivating - but not on a level with Dickens.<br />  As I suggested to a friend, this novel is a classic, by all means read it. However, don't be in a hurry to do so and if you never get round to it, oh well!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really can't say enough good things about the book.  It is well written, engaging and just an all-around interesting read.  Very enjoyable.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|the book is quite a psychological thriller and kept my attention.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants not just a story about a murder but a story that has some plausible complexity to it.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I bought it for the music but Adele also gets personal and explains each song, so i enjoyed all of it.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Excellent story can't wait till may for the 3rd book.....a must read for all who loved fifty.....but this one a much better read......
0062515675|5.0|I have read this book more than once. It is by far, the best self help book I have read. It takes you on a fascinating journey, while at the same time, planting or re-planting some good common sense rules. I enjoy giving this book to my clients and would be clients.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|ok this is the best app. i got this about a month ago and I'm  addicted i am always caught playing it. it's  a cute game like temple run but so much better. i have to say i play this at least once evryday...get this app!!:)~loveit~&lt;3
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have been hooked on this series since the first show.  I cannot watch it on Sundays so I have to purchase it on Amazon, BUT, I get to watch it without commercials and if I think I've missed something, I can go back and watch it again, which I do alot.  Anyway, the show is gripping and keeps you in suspense and the special effects are great, GORE!  don't let the little ones watch!!! If you are interested, start at season 1 and watch it thru. You would miss alot if you did not....
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham always knows how to keep you interested in his books from the moment you start reading.  This book is no different; you are totally involved with each page you read. Hard to put this one down. A great read on my Kindle.
B00009R86L|5.0|This is a great pad for anyone who has to carry a one shoulder bag.  It is very cushioned and easy to put on to any strap.  Makes a heavy bag much more comfortable to carry.  Highly recommended!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is so versatile. I download all my favorite songs through this using the &quot;audio only&quot; option and it automatically puts it all into my music on my KindleFire without me having to mess with Amazon Cloud Player or buy the songs either. I can also download videos for my little siblings to watch AND put them in a playlist to play without having to stop and manually press each video. Then I download my favorite BBC productions from YouTube to watch anytime anywhere- without Internet connection! I could go on and on and on but I will spare you my ramblings. It is a great app, you cannot beat the price tag ($0.00), the advertisements are fairly unobtrusive and if you are a music or YouTube lover I say go get it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Delivery was fast as promised, in great condition (like new), played fine, and the movie is awesome.  Every father and family member should see this movie.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Loved it usually I read the book first before its made into a movie or show it was very interesting to see the differences the other way around
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I found this to be a fun app and would definitely take pictures with the intention of printing them in &ldquo;cartoon&quot; mode just for something new and creative!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This was always my favorite book when I was little and my dad would read me to sleep. It's still  a gr<br />eat bedtime story and brings back those wonderful childhood memories. Grover can still make me laugh.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Best book ever it is so good I can't wait until number 8 comes out it will be so good
B00A12Z264|5.0|I bought this the day it came out and have spent the last few days listening to it. Reviewing isn't something i do often and I certainly didn't want to do it on the first day since I don't feel that is fair when it comes to music. I need a few days to really form an opinion most of the time considering songs have to grow on me.<br /><br />I'm a huge Christina fan and have bought every album she has come out with. I was determined to get this regardless of what others said about it. I was a little nervous considering Bionic (not that i hated it, there are some really good songs on it). Stripped was my favorite album by far I really think this will be a close 2nd.<br /><br />My favorites so far are Army of Me, Sing for Me, Blank Page, Best of Me, Just a Fool, Light up the Sky, and Empty Words. These songs are a little more emotional and seem to showcase Christina's amazing vocals best.<br />I don't hate any of the songs though Circles and Shut up don't do much for me. Most of the songs gave me chills the first time i heard them, that was how i reacted to Stripped also. I am very happy with this purchase and hope it does well sales wise.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This 2-season set is just what we needed to bridge the time we must wait until season 3 comes out in the U.S.  We're loving the extra scenes (when we notice them) and are grateful for basic features such as subtitles (for my elderly father -- who is hooked on Downton).  The sale price was a bonus, so a great buy all around.  Bring on season 3!
B00A135YUW|5.0|LDR is absolutely amazing! Her voice is intoxicating. Love this album. Ride, American, Yayo, Cola, and just about every other song on this album are my new favorites.<br />Paradise is a great follow up to Born to Die and it delivers in every way possible.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I don't have to 'read' books to judge them.  Based on that Five Star reviewer who announced that it arrived on time, I know this is a good book, one that family and friends will enjoy forever, given that the cat doesn't kill them first.  Why, when a book arrives on time, you know that the author really gave his all to it, unless the cat killed him first.  It indicates the kind of care and effort on the part of the editor that makes a story flow, providing that the cat did not get to him before he was finished. And when I say him, I mean him or her, because as well all know, cats could care less.  The important thing is, the delivery was handled in a timely fashion. Here is an example: I ordered some medicine from \\"Meds R Us\\" -- they promise to do their best to send meds that are pretty much like the ones you order, give or take, but they guarantee...GAUR.AN.TEE they will arrive so quickly, your head will spin. Plus they'll be shipped in an attractive Blue Box.  Can you ask for better?  No, you cannot.  Unless the cat kills you first. Okay, it turned out that it was not my heart medicine, just some Tibetan foot ointment, but come on, people, you can't have everything. that's what's wrong with this country, everybody is all about ME ME ME, I want, I want.  Suck it up. With good delivery and a new attitude, we will be great again, just you wait and see. Unless the cat kills us first.  So if you order anything from Amazon, particularly something expensive, please, review the delivery...and spare us not the details.  What kind of package? Was it that ripply corrugated cardboard or just a box? What color box.  Was the label hand-written? Did they double tape it? Was the UPS guy cute?  Otherwise I'm sending my cat over to kill you.
B0041B4H1M|5.0|We just got our 1st Blu-ray player and this was one of the movies we wanted to upgrade from DVD. Love these movies especially on Blu-ray.
B005LAII08|4.0|This movie is entertaining enough, but the truly impressive thing for me is how the artists at Pixar have advanced the techniques for animating and texturing clothing, hair, skin and hide, muscles and inner body structures, so they all move together in a natural way that is a wonder to behold. There is a great amount of skill and hard work that has gone into making this possible, even with the help of great computer-aided animation software. This movie can be an important landmark in the evolution of animated films. Pixar has been producing landmark movies every two years or so, and one can be glad that, after becoming part of Disney, they retain and continue to sharpen their artistic and technical edge.<br />Having seen now the movie twice, first in 3-D at a theater, and now on DVD in 2-D, my impression is that both versions are equally interesting and a pleasure to watch: those detailed backgrounds of leafy and mysterious forests and of the wonderful and craggy Highlands' landscapes are rendered with a poetic sensitivity that reminds me of Miyazaki's work.<br />When it comes to the tale being told with such a display of technical prowess, while I can't find anything seriously wrong with it, it has left me wishing they can get Brad Byrd (Incredibles, Ratatouille) back on the director's chair once again, and soon. I miss those charming, offbeat, uniquely inventive stories.<br />\\"Brave\\", on the other hand, is a conventional fairy tale, with light and dark passages as it is traditional to have in such stories. I felt that the balance between light and dark was a bit off: too much slap-stick, perhaps. But that is a minor qualm, and most people who like animated movies will probably find this one is a good one to go and see, or buy.

B004UNX1LS|1.0|I was excited to get this app. Then I opened it to watch the music videos and was surprised by how poor the quality is. You can find better quality videos on Youtube. I don't recommend getting this app. I hope they update it and fix the quality of the videos.
B002VECM72|5.0|We just got our 1st Blu-ray player and this was one of the movies we wanted to upgrade from DVD. Love these movies especially on Blu-ray.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This is one of the best books I have seen Jeff Kinney this is far better than the Hunger Games by a long shot people have said but I say the Hunger Games is better because of more complex detail.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|We just got our 1st Blu-ray player and this was one of the movies we wanted to upgrade from DVD. Love these movies especially on Blu-ray.
B000I186FW|4.0|Very political film, a lot of action and suspense. Great fighting scenes and very good story line. Remember remember the 5 of november!
B0049M7BDE|5.0|We just got our 1st Blu-ray player and this was one of the movies we wanted to upgrade from DVD. Love these movies especially on Blu-ray.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying pinterest on my kindle fire.  It is so user friendly.  I have not had any issues with the app at all.

B00002N9ER|5.0|These things are awesome...I mounted them in the back of my Jeep Grand Cherokee.  But I found that they are very tight and there is no sliding at all, so there is no risk of the flashlight flying out like some other folks stated.  I love them!
B0082SU98U|5.0|This book teaches you to feel glad for small things, teaches you that every coin has two sides. Try not to see only the bad side.
B000XJSL9U|5.0|Great sequel in the Die Hard series. Undoubtedly targeted at a younger demographic with the appearance of Justin Long, but his nervous geek character is a great counterpoint to Bruce Willis. Think of it as a buddy movie on steroids.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I love this album and have listened to it over and over again.  Keep in mind I am a huge Fagen fan so this review is biased.  If you think Lady Gaga makes great music, this joint is not for you.  One of the best thing about this album is the tightness and looseness of the rhythm section, like the bass and drummer are playing around with the timing and it is just so funky.  Songwriting not as good as the Night Fly but the music and the band are better and brighter.
B001NI24OI|3.0|TV series took the best of this movie and made it better. Don't bother if you are a fan of the series
B000FBJAOG|1.0|I read this having heard that it was a humorous satire. This reads like a navy SEAL writing about how to survive armageddon except insert \\"zombie\\" for \\"arab\\", \\"liberal\\", etc. Not a laugh to be had and frankly something only a zombie fanatic or crazed militia member could even get through.
144234900X|3.0|I'm a fan of the TV series, but the unabridged audio is too detailed.  Seems like it was made that way just to fill the discs.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a very good app. I love it. I play it every day. I haven't had any glitches or crashes.
