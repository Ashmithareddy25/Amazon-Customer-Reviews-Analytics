B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book is the best from the twilight saga. It brings more of this story to life than i ever thought possible. I  you haven't watched the movie yet then be prepared
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is the 2nd best game ever(if you couldn't read the title!)!<br />It's really fun and easy to get the hang of.<br />So umm... I recommend that you get it....
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I have really enjoyed the movie and am glad to own such a great work in my collection. Get it.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|This game is ok, for little kids its great, but its always giving me constant notifications, and is really annoying plus I'm just not happy with what they've done with littlest pet shop it was completely different when I was a kid.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a good, challenging game that I use to pass time or just play to have fun. Definitely would recommend this game.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I have really enjoyed the movies and I am glad to own such a great work in my collection. Get it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found this game to be quite addicting.<br />It's not too hard, or to easy... Plus having different rooms to go through was fun.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I have really enjoyed the movie and I am glad to own such a great work in my collection. Get it
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It comes with easy to follow assembly instructions and the tool itself is fairly easy to use.<br />The part i was not impressed with was the process. The 'cutter' actually scores the glass and you are required to break the glass along the score by submerging the bottle in extreme hot and water temperatures. Not to mention all the sanding you have to do later.<br />The reason I mention this is not from animosity, the advertisement shows three easy steps and honey, don't let them fool you like they did me. It is a long process so make sure you have time to do it and don't get too attached to any bottles; you'll need a few test dummies to practice on.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I have really enjoyed the movie and I am glad to own such a great work in my collection. Get it
B008OOYALE|5.0|This one of the best game that I have ever play I like it a lot they should do another game of this type
B003YGSLDA|5.0|I have really enjoyed the movie and I am glad to own such a great work in my collection. Get it
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|It's like watching a Miss Marple mystery or Agatha Christie...you know what's going to happen in the end but you still enjoy the various steps along the way...I loved the ambience of the retirement house for musicians and opera singers...their quirkiness, the initial snobbish air of Maggie Smith's character which, of course, changes during the course of the movie...in addition to the 4 main characters, the movie is laced with performances from many real actors, musicians, singers, and plain old hoofers who are now old but still have that something going for them. If you like Masterpiece Theatre and are a major Anglophile, this is a good fit for you. Tom Courtenay's character even spices things up with a comparison of opera with modern hiphop music, including an ad lib, a cappella example from a teenage black high school student. Billy Connolly plays Wilf, a kind of old rake dancing on the edge of dirty old man, pinching the girls and peeing in the bushes. Pauline Collins plays Cissy, a wispy, lovely, happy singer who sometimes loses it, but whose friends bring her back to the present tense. Try it, you'll like it...

159463176X|5.0|I've read all three of Hosseini's books.  Very enjoyable reading.  We all need to learn about other people and cultures.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very interesting game want more!!  will recommend this to husband and friends. more levels would be great especially for people like me
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I loved it, her voice is Stunning, will be buying more of her albums as they come out and any ones that I have missed
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging enough to be interesting but not so hard as to be frustrating.  It reminds me of 100 Doors but much more logical.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|This is my second Seiko 5 watch. I like them because they are automatic. Not needing a battery they are basically care free. I needed a watch for the Summer heat and thought the canvas band would be less restrictive than a metal band. It is, however, the canvas fibers block the stem from going through the hole. I spend far too much time and energy wrestling with the band when putting the watch on in the morning.<br />Still, the watch is stylish. I'm happy with the price and operation of the watch. I'll eventually buy another band.
B00BESM14U|3.0|THis was a fun movie to watch.  Its a good way to enjoy the night, but nothing amazingly groundbreaking.  Definitely worth a watch.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|James touches on many things that I , as a sole proprietor in business, have been thinking and makes it all make sense. James is disarmingly honest about his own setbacks and failures which makes he writing super-personal which is his most vital hook.
0857051873|5.0|I'm giving it 5-Stars because there's no more stars to give... This is one of the best thrillers I've read.<br /><br />Alex is the first Pierre Lemaitre's novel translated into English. Oh! How I wish I could read French.<br /><br />For all crime and thriller readers out there: YOU HAVE TO READ THIS!<br /><br />Since you can read the summary here, I won't get into the plot because it would be complicated. I don't know how to talk about Alex without spoiling it.<br /><br />Instead, I'm going to tell you that Lemaitre has created two master characters that will live with me forever. I absolutely loved Inspector Camille. He is not your usual crime scene leader because he is almost a midget. However, that would be a midget just on the outside :-)<br /><br />In Alex, a woman is kidnapped. Obviously you are going to find out the whys later. What I want to point out is that the kidnapping reminded me of The keeper of lost causes. Both kidnaps are very unusual and kept me thinking \\"what's next?\\" \\"could that be even possible?\\"<br /><br />Apparently, the best thrillers come from another language! Think of Jussi Adler-Olsen, Camilla L&auml;ckberg and Stieg Larsson.<br /><br />I think I am going to develop an OCD with Lemaitre.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and easy to learn how to play. It's one of my favorite games.I like how you get sneakers with extra boost so you can jump on and over things. Oh by the way this is a 10 year old who enjoys this app hope they make another game like this.
0345529057|5.0|I actually bought this series as a birthday gift for my son.  I have read all four of the books and I love them.  Getting ready to start on the 5th one.  I hope George R.R. Martin get busy writing books 6/7.  It's one of the best series I have read.  Love watching the tv series too.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter is the one of the best shows on tv. I just love. I hat that it is ending but can't wait to see how it is going to unfold.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Great movie... Thoroughly enjoyed the rough and tumble gangster story set in the heart of Boston.  One to be watched over and over again.
0679805273|5.0|I got this one after reading a Facebook posting someone found on Pinterest.  Each year, starting in Kindergarten have your child's teacher write a short note to your child.  Paste in a picture of your child with that teacher, if you want, and present the book to your child when they graduate from high school.  What a wonderful memoir for your child!<br /><br />Now... if only I can be organized enough over the next 12 years to actually accomplish this.
1878424505|5.0|This book is packed full of Knowledge.<br />You can change your life with just making<br />4 new agreements with yourself.<br />It takes discipline to really follow the book,<br />but you can keep your mind free and clear if you keep practicing.<br />You can turn it to any page and start reading it.<br />You can appreciate the messages.<br />I keep it in my bathroom, and read a little<br />bit everyday to remind me that you can live a drama free life.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game!  Very much looking forward to new levels.  I love that the puzzles build on each other. Would definitely recommend!
B00CATSONE|4.0|This book is a crash course on the life of Nikola Tesla, but only focusing on the facts and his creations. It gives a peek into how money can squash genius, and kind of made me hate Edison. After the walkthrough of Tesla's life, the author wraps it up with the concept that imagination is a more important trait than intelligence or wealth. I had no idea of the plethora of advanced concepts that Tesla dreamed up - from DC power to the Internet, eclectic cars to most likely the first contact with extraterrestrial life. Yet, he was practically ignored in history books. I'd like to get more into the psyche of the man, and will be looking for other books to get to know him better.
1616550414|5.0|this is one of the best things that nintendo has ever made! i know it's just Shiggy trying to tie in all the Nintendo games together but somehow it just works. lot's of content and art and hystory! (see what i did there?)
B00CWY76CC|3.0|by far I've. enjoyed. the game but it's. so short and a waste of time. u will only enjoy it for a little bit then it's. over.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfer is a fun app and with the updates like every month. U can't really get bored unless u get a super high score like me.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|because he plays great and real gets in the role of james kirk plus the movie had alot of action
B00CWY76CC|5.0|You should not get this game if you do not like hard games. If you like hard games then get this game it well be fun for you. The good thing is that it is free and Olive free games. So get this game.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Really love this serie! Their is a couple of caracters that you don't know if they are the goods one or evil. You just to keep watching, is addictive!!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The first one I ordered didn't fit at all.  Amazon, in it's usual first-class way, told me to send it back and they immediately sent another one - that does fit.  No extra charges for anything.  Thanks, Amazon.....you rock!
B00D8WJ9JK|4.0|I didn't even know this album was coming out until the week of its release. I was listening to power 105 and they played some songs off it, and I thought, \\" jeez I have to check this out.\\" I liked his first album, though I didn't love it or play it much after a few months, and the clips sounded different; more similar to his older material. The subject matter seems to be very similar, but the beats and vocal performance and flow are the main differences. It sounds very different. It seems less aimed for commercial appeal (though he pulled that off well last time anyway) and more straight hip hop. The old samples he uses are cool, and he does his thing on them. Cole is a dope lyricist and versatile hip hop producer in case the last album made anyone forget. I think after he gained the commercial success he wanted to take it back, which I respect. Even the \\"power trip\\" single is clearly a different animal than say \\"work out\\" or \\"mr nice watch.\\" You'll understand after hearing the song clips.<br /><br /> I heard some people criticize songs such as \\"Let Nas Down,\\" but for someone without a father figure who looks up to a man for a lot of inspiration and loves their work, hearing him disapprove of you can be hurtful. I think it's a great story and its not like its too sappy. Now, Game makes it sound kind of weird. It's not smooth at all. Cole sounds more natural and sincere than forced or emotionally unstable.<br /><br />All in all I think this is an album that to be listened to actively and fully to get a clear picture and make a decision on whether or not you like it. Chances are though, if you're even considering buying it, it's worth it. I'm not in love with it, but I like it and I've still only heard it once or twice through. I'm actually gonna play it again now...
B0069GRIHW|3.0|Was never much of a fan of the doors, liking only one or two songs. This CD was pleasant to listen to having a blue's/jazz feel to it. Very layed back easy listening. Enjoyed it.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Seriously I love this game. It keeps my attention and is challenging. Really easy to play in the kindle fire.
B000LTAY1U|1.0|It only took 4 days since I ordered this here in Amazon. I was hesitant at first to buy a watch on line especially Seiko watches knowing there are a lot of fake ones circling around. But still gave it a try since I can't find anything around my area with this kind and with this prize? I gave it a try. It came with very good packaging including its original box and papers inside. The first thing I checked if it's really an automatic watch. I hate battery operated watches! It seemed look original to me and when I compared it online it also matches with the product descriptions and its numbers. It has \\"MALAYSIA MOVEMENT KY\\" written on the transparent cover at the back of the watch. I checked it online to confirm its authenticity. Just checking... I bought this for work and fits really well. I gave it 4 stars for the \\"MALAYSIA\\" written at the back. I like JAPAN better! All in all, I still like it!<br /><br />Update: November 17, 2013<br />I noticed on the first week since I started wearing this watch it has been losing at least a minute after a couple of days. I haven't done anything to correct this but to adjust it every week (every Monday specifically when I get to work to synchronize it with the employee time recorder). I don't wanna call seiko or amazon about this minor issue after I read one of the reviewers here wrote that seiko doesn't recognize amazon as one of their sellers of their watches. I wrote this review just to let you guys know (based on my experience) about this product and maybe at least can help/inform others before deciding to buy this product. I still like the watch tho.<br /><br />It stopped working... (8/14/2014).
B007C4ZJ3K|3.0|I thought this movie had great action at times.  Gina Carano is amazing.  It was a little slow at times, though.
0670026557|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It is well written, and thought provoking.  The authors talks about three types of people.  There are takers, matchers, and givers.  What is shocking is that givers are at the bottom and top of most areas in life.  A giver can fail poorly, or in the long run become the most successful.  There is little room for the middle ground with givers.  So the author seems to provide a book to help the giver deal with life and situations successfully.  The chapters are just interesting.  Over and over again, there is sections that really make you think, as well as teach you a lot.  One is the chapter on the Panda and the Peacock.  One would be shocked to know that you can tell a lot about the size of the CEO's picture in the company handout.  The chapter on the art of powerless communication is great.  It teaches you how to persuade people, without being overbearing.  The reality of this book is that all of the chapters are insightful and full of wisdom.  Even if you are not a classic giver, you realize the need to be, and you develop some of the skills that a giver has.  It is a great book for personal development, and just down right fun to read.  One of the chapters even talks about not being a doormat for others.  This is a serious problem for some givers, and is mostly the reason for those givers being at the top or bottom in regards to success.  Check this book out, it is worth your read and time.
B00B4804KS|4.0|This movie is always great.  I found, on my Samsung 8000 model TV, that 3D effects along the edges look odd.  I think most 3D movies try to avoid this but i found Jurassic Park had a lot of these effects that woud be along the edges....probably because it was not designed to be a 3d movie.  However, there were some amazing scenes in 3D like the first T-Rex experience.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I love this game tons of weapons, characters, maps, and even Vehicles!<br />Controls take a bit of getting used to but are overall pretty simple. You can friend people, and even chat with them. GET THIS GAME! And I'll see u there.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|the quality is awesome, I wish there were more floors though. but I love how there's steps to opening the elevator
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I love Dexter and Season Seven did NOT disappoint...It is also one of the first sets I've bought that didn't have serious play flaws due to shabby and sloppy manufacturing...like skipping and freezing...wish I could say it was my machine...but, I know it's the discs...anyhew...the show was great and I hope it continues for many more seasons!!!
B009S33I68|5.0|I've always heard about the Vietnam war but this book made me realize how difficult it really was for our soldiers. Love the book and I have recommended to some of my friends.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Great music, great photography, great service! Fun to listen to and watch. Just the right balance of humor and seriousness. Well produced. Fast delivery.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|great app . this review thing is just stupid.  but the game is great, except when there are missing clues and you have to go on youtube to find the answer or clue
B001EC3JME|5.0|Good quality - tough - well made - tight (your flash light won't slip out of this holster), but a little difficult to get the light is and out - which is minor considering you simply cannot lose it by accident.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love Mahjong and this one is not a disappointment! I paid for the 99 cent version and received several more puzzles...well worth it! I've had no issues with this game.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is a very good hunt & search puzzle game. I really was enjoying it up until I got stuck & thee was no hints or help.
B006G2ZEV6|1.0|Game is totally unplayable on kindle fire hd 8.9&quot; because there's no text on any menu buttons or options so you can't tell what you're doing ever at all.
0385349947|5.0|The message was clear in presenting how women's significant contributions in the workplace are undervalued by both men and women.  Awareness is the first line of advancement.  After reading the book I realized that I had dumbed down my own resume a number of times, rather than LEAN IN.  Thank you Sharon for raising my awareness!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is awesome. I love it because of all the characters, you even have the not important characters! The only thing I don't like is the gems that we have to pay for, especially for rarity and rainbowdash! Please change that!
B0063IH60K|2.0|Winning this game is close to impossible. It makes sure no appropriate cards appear. Free cell is a much better game
B004478AS4|4.0|Makes for easy reading for the intended age range, even with accommodations for the nuances of a very different but very rich culture.
B006FPFTMS|5.0|I've used foxit on my pc for a long time - works equally well on my android phone. It's great
B002L2GK0O|5.0|I bought the kindle version. Its a must have if you are an amature brewer. Lots of tips and techniques. Happy Brewing people!
B0063M22QO|3.0|The Kindle Mahjong is easy to play and Fun.  Try it yourself!  It is a pleasant way to kill some time and doesn't, require a great deal of concentration.
B0073AHR2O|5.0|Anyone who has researched and read extensively on the Roswell crash need to read this book. Want to know how we got all the latest technology.......read this book!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|love the game on my android but hats it on kindle. it doesn't allow u to update it to the newer version so I'm stuck playing Sydney
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Side Effects is a movie where a young woman's world unravels when a drug prescribed by her psychiatrist has unexpected side effects and all is not what it seems.<br /><br />The movie starts a bit slow and almost lost me because it did so before the action picked up and the story started coming together.  Both Law and Zeta Jones play solid roles with Zeta Jones especially playing it up as the Psychiatrist with a hidden agenda.<br /><br />Overall, the movie kept me entertained and provided a decent dramatic and suspenseful thriller.  Worth a rent.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Glad I have the next 2 days off from work so I can continue reading the next book in this series! Didn't like the bro/sis twist... how long till that gets sorted out? But everything else is awesome!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|My only problem with facebook is that I have a shortcut to get to the app on my android, thank goodness, as I forgot my password. Well, accdg to fb, you cannot fix it alone, you have to call three friends on your fb list to help you access to recover or change it!  I had to get on my laptop to find that out!
0451205766|5.0|Seen the movie a million times but nothing compares with the actual book. LOVE the characters.  Enjoyed getting to know them again!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is such a great book and I look forward to reading the next two. I think all the raw emotion in this book give it more off a sense of humanity that the movie was lacking. I loved the movie but the book offers so much more.
B004EF65QA|5.0|I wanted more.  I loved the story line.  Loved the history.  It was great!  If you want romance jammed back with history and hardship, then this is the mini series for you!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This app sucks and they ignore our comments. I'm never buying an app from amazon again. I'm going to the Google app store RIGHT NOW and buying the full game.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This book is unlike anything I have read before, told through the eyes of a socially awkward, highly intelligent man. Easy to read with characters that grow on you & a feel good story. Well worth a read!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I bought this book because one of my friends recommended it shortly after the series was picked up by HBO.  I read this book in under a week.  That's how good it is.<br /><br />Style: 10/10 - George RR Martins style is unique I feel.  The way he writes is by telling the story from many different points of view on characters that are vastly different.  The viewpoints you get from these characters differs so much, and you bond with them all, whether they be good or evil.<br /><br />Through this method of story telling, he tells what's going on all over the isle of Westeros, and across the Narrow Sea, all while shifting your perspectives on other characters by getting insides their minds.  One of my least favorite characters in this book has become one of my favorite of the series, all because you don't see his point of view during book 1.<br /><br />GREAT BOOK.
0062206281|1.0|As I started reading this, having enjoyed the Angel's Game and Shadow of the Wind so immensely, I thought someone had played a joke on me.  Why is Dan Brown pretending to be Carlos Zafon?  Does Zafon have a new translator who has decided to rewrite the book?  Why is there so much pointless dialogue?  What happened to the quality of his writing?  Where are the big ideas?  Where is the sense of magical realism?  Why does this book suck so badly I was almost tempted to send it back to Amazon and ask for my money back?<br /><br />All these questions and more will go unanswered I suppose.  But this was such a HUGE disappointment, I'm tempted to not even read his writing again.  The story telling was lazy, relying on a large number of facts ascertained in the previous books.  He even pimps his own book, when one character asks another if they've ever read the Angel's Game!!!  How pathetic is that?  There was little or nothing about Carax.  Basically he ended a number of plot lines in a manner that read like \\"they were all in a bus that went over a cliff and they all died. The end.\\"  Even the poisoning of a previously major character was handled with all the skill of a tenth grade student.  Who took ESL classes for most of their life.<br /><br />This was so bad that it was insulting to his fans.  So insulting, I'm not sure he deserved us at all.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loved it. It's a great CD. Thanks!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game keeps you interested and keeps your brain working. Not too easy and not too hard. Good job guys
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|This album is very good and you should give it a few listens to really have a better perspective on it. The album isn't going to grab everyone's attention after one listen and it's one of those albums that would have to grow on you. Throughout the whole album I could say I like 7 out of the 10 tracks but 3-4 of those tracks stand out the most. The album in my opinion should of been longer instead of 10 tracks. I hate the fact that people are bashing the album when he literally made the album 2 weeks ago, In my opinion he should of pushed the album release to another date and worked more on the album. The album had a lot of success for an album that didn't have any tracks on the radio and barely any crazy promotional stunts. It's not his best album because his last album was PERFECT no doubt, but it's something new. Most artists are scared to tried new things and Kanye isn't. The lyrics weren't up to par with this album considering that he wrote the lyrics in less than a week but this album is great production wise and the beats are insane!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging but still easy enough if you're persistent. I've been working on it off and on today and got to level 11.
0470901071|5.0|I'm enjoying it, this full well is a very good tool to prepare themselves and then take the test.. realy good

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Funny u got to be smart will be a good game for a detective to they could practice it just like finding clues and putting all the pieces together just to seascape the room so the challenge is &quot;CAN YOU ESCAPE&quot;
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It needs  more cars and tracks maybe a helicopter and a map for the helicopter maybe a dune buggy  and maybe a go cart
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers cool game ever<br />Best the cool running game ever since been in my life for ever long asome
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Good game I like it great graphics and action. Kinda slow on getting things but I think I'll get used to it. I play it all the time.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is my 3rd Kate Morton novel.  Really really liked this one and the end was a surprise.  I enjoyed as always with Morton's books the difference in time - the story spans probably 50 yrs or so and connects the characters beautifully.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This has been an invaluable app. I highly recommend it! It's a great barometer letting you know just how much battery life you have.
B004LROUNG|3.0|However it seemed to drag in places and wasn't as good as I am used to from other Grisham books.  I may quit buying this author just based on his name alone.
0679805273|5.0|The book is wonderful.  Every graduate young and old should read it.  Besides being fun reading it has a special message for the reader.  I bought it for a graduation gift for my granddaughter and when she opened her gift and found the book and the cup to go with it she was delighted.  I would highlty recommend this book.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I love Nelson DeMille and his John Corey character - however this one did not keep me interested and I had to make myself finish it.  It did get better at the end.  I think the setting was part of the problem.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My kindergartner loves this game as much as I do! The beginner levels are perfect for her, and the higher ones are perfectly challenging for me.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|I had hoped it would provide more information but it is just the very basics.  Better to just go to Weather.com app on my phone.
0679805273|5.0|Best advice one can give a newly graduating senior.  Everything you need to know in life is contained in the book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched the first two seasons free on Amazon thanks to Amazon Prime.  Nothing would do that I finish what was available so I would be caught up when Season 4 begins, so of course I purchased Season 3.  It did not disappoint.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Fun, unusual story, captivating and romantic at the same time - you'll have a hard time putting it down and be sorry when it ends.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I sometimes use this for my alarm clock as opposed to my regular clock or my phone.  It works well and has lots of different ringtones that you can use.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I thought that this was just a review book! Very little new story in this one! Heard that this was the last installment now I know why!
B007EECSFA|5.0|really loved this book and it inspired me to go back and read her earlier books.  so far I have read two of them and they did not disappoint.  Cannot wait for something new to come out!

B0015DROBO|2.0|I know everyone loves this author and this book - I finally decided to try it.  Just was not impressed and did not finish this book.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I have been to many, many concerts but of all the concerts on DVD this was the most real concert that I have seen and they brought back the good memories of Andy, singing with him, Grease, and Saturday Night Fever. It was the greatest.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I am hooked on Kate Morton - this is the second novel I have read.  I love how she incorporates mysteries into different periods of time.  Usually there is a 50 year time difference in when the story began and when it ends.  You learn of different historic events and how they affected thos in that time and meet characters and their descendants who often are the one to solve the mystery!
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|This app makes it easy for you to use phone camera by taking a picture of a document and saving it as a PDF. Quicker than using a computer. Plus I always have issues with my flat bed scanner, this is so much easier and quicker.
B0097HSS4M|2.0|This app is not very good! It gives you reminders to write a GOOD review, like I got a reminder and it said:<br /><br />Rate this app 5 stars<br /><br />Remind me later<br /><br />Forget<br /><br />I would not recommend this app it does not work easily!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game really gets you thinking. the levels are challenging enough to keep me interested. great job you should make more games like this
B00A50PDDY|5.0|If I could rate this album any more than 5 stars, I would. Each song on Vessel connected with me instantly. The first song I ever heard by the group was \\"Migraine\\", when I was driving down the road in the car listening to a local radio station. I thought, \\"This is genius! I'll have to remember the name and look them up when I get home.\\" So I did. I did my research on Twenty One Pilots and discovered that they'd released 3 albums; Twenty One Pilots, Regional at Best, and Vessel. I tried to listen to their self-titled record and couldn't get into it as much. Then, I moved on to Regional at Best and began to think they might be on to something. From there, I proceeded to Vessel, their third studio album and a compilation of songs from Regional and new songs. I was in 100% shock at how amazing it truly is. After hearing the Fueled by Ramen-released album, I had to find live dates and see them ASAP. And sure enough, right then, I discovered that the radio station where I heard them for the first time was holding a FREE event which they were co-headlining with Coheed and Cambria, another amazing band. And how could I NOT go to THAT? Needless to say, I attended the event. But something happened. I was no longer inspired just by LISTENING to Vessel. THEIR LIVE SHOW INSPIRED ME MORE! Musical geniuses Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun brought their first major-label effort to a crowd of nearly 6,000 ecstatic fans. And by the time they left, they were in total denial that they could have seen something so incredible in their lives. Not to mention, I was in the front row, and I caught (and still have) one of the streamers they fired into the crowd, so that made me feel like a piece of them is with me, which is strange, but cool. The bottom line is, if you're skeptical about buying Vessel..... stop thinking and do it.
B0051T47NQ|2.0|This is a great movie for Scandinavians the world over! Sure, it's like the Blair Witch Project in that it uses amateur cinematography, but everything else about it is hilarious. I bought it for my Mother whom is 50% Norwegian and Brother whom is 25% Norwegian, and they both enjoyed it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the DVDs aspect ratio stretched the screen larger than my Mother's HDTV, so we couldn't see the subtitles at all. If the DVD fit her TV, it would have received a higher rating. Why sell a DVD with an aspect ratio that doesn't fit a standard HDTV?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game! It is fun and challenging.I don\\"t usually play games a lot on my kindle but this game has changed my mind.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. I can't wait to see the new shark.If you don't know what I'm talking about get the hammer head it won't show you unil you exasperence the GW shark
B00CC1K320|1.0|I purchased this item and when I received it, I felt ripped off.<br />This item feels very cheap in your hand. A thin plastic cover for your device. It does nothing to add any protection and does nothing to add confidence when in use.<br />It was returned within a day.<br />I have ready a bunch of people that have reviewed this item that actually put in pro's when I could not find one.<br />Keep looking if you want something that you won't be embarrassed to have on your $600 Phone.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed it. Glad I didn't see the movie first.  It was totally different. Not bad but I liked the book much more
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|OK, I admit that I'm a wizard of oz buff, and the fact that I watched this with my children (who oddly enough have never seen the wizard of oz) may skew my opinion, bit we all loved this movie. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is because 1) there were no ruby slippers mentioned, and 2) the climax between east and north is pretty pathetic. Bit if you watched the original offer and over as a kid, then you'll love this prequill.
B009MYARIK|4.0|This is a great book for a summer read.  It is laugh-out-loud funny in some parts and tells a good story.  My only criticism is that the story is a bit too drawn out - the plot keeps going over and over the same story line (there are only so many ways to disrupt a honeymoon) and after a while it gets somewhat old.  Overall, it is a fun story to read!
B001974DG0|5.0|I am a huge dog lover so this was an exciting book for me. I loved the concept and in the case of Einstein, I wish it were true. I did have one really smart dog years ago but even he had his limits. Great story, very imaginative. If  scientists really could  engineer a dog like Einstein, I think it would be great for lonely people in the world and radically change our population issues. Who would need children if you had an Einstein ?
B005FHXB0O|5.0|The acting is superb. I remember when this movie first came out in 95 and a lot of the actors were little known. Watching it now, and seeing all these stars before they were top billed was awesome.  Lots of action. ~ Off the charts. You will laugh and cry at this highly charged &#34;cult classic&#34; by Quentin Tarantino. Christian Slater was born for this role.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|\\"Some people bring out the worst in you, others bring out the best, and then there are those remarkably rare, addictive ones who just bring out the most. Of everything.\\"<br /><br />I'm so sad to see Macs story end it has been a fantastic ride.  I loved this book!!!  KMM gave me some much unexpected plot twists that honestly I didn't see coming.  First we start off exactly where Dreamfever left us on the cliff and wow my heart wrenched.  The pain Mac feels and the sorrow was excruciating I felt broken for her.  But the story must go forward and she has a plan.<br /><br />\\"Safety is a fence, and fences are for sheep. I would rather die at twenty-two, knowing the truth, then live in a cage of lies for a hundred years.\\"<br /><br />All the main players are back and while not everything is resolved I thought that so much of it was that I didn't care about a few points that weren't.  Mac 5.0 now has had a few realizations since the death of the beast on the cliff.  Hindsight always 20/20 and her new plan created some strange bedfellows with odd repercussions.  I will say that KMM kept me guessing with who Mac really was I had multiple theories throughout the book and I am happy so say all of them were wrong, I love it when the answer is so creative and well thought out that even though there were clues to the real answer I don't guess it.<br /><br />Also we learn who killed Alina in this book and why.  Even though part of what happened to Alina was like I thought the other part tragically didn't and bravo again to KMM for twisting my heartstrings.  All I can say is that the story was well paced the sexual tension was exquisite between Barrons and Mac and I couldn't have wanted them to work out any other way.  There were surprises around every corner and just when you think you've settled in for a smooth ride you are wrong.  I could not put this book down for anything else going on in my life much to my husband's chagrin.  The final showdown with the book was amazing and the final twist fantastic thank you KMM.<br /><br />Mac and Barrons have become one of my favorite ships in literature and I love that KMM wrote such an imperfect main character.  He is not the hero or antihero waiting to be redeemed.  He is solid in who and what he is and makes no apologies for it take him or leave him as he is he is perfectly imperfect and I swoon for him anyway along with Mac.<br /><br />\\"When you know who I am. Let me be your man.\\"<br /><br />The Fever world was one I definitely enjoyed and I will say that the final two books in the series are some of the best I've read for adults in UF.e final twist fantastic thank you KMM.<br /><br />Mac and Barrons have become one of my favorite ships in literature and I love that KMM wrote such an imperfect main character.

B005YPJ8Q8|5.0|Australian author Markus Zusak, best well known for his New York Times Best seller, The Book Thief, wrote I Am The Messenger beforeThe Book Thief came out. This book is full of quirky, sweet, loveable, terrible pasionate and just plain funny characters. although this book was written for the young adult reader, I found it to be enjoyable  did all of my other 30 something friends and my 60 year old father! this book takes you on a life changing journey with character Ed Kennedy. Ed is just a regular 19 year old nobodywho discovers, with a little help from mysterious sources, that life can be full of beauty, hope, violence, simple joys and caring. you will find out how it's done in I Am The Messenger. I love this book so much I have listened to it on audible and bought three copies from Amazon. 2 copies were for friends who are a little bit like Ed. Enjoy the book!
0670026557|5.0|After reading a cover story on Grant in the book in The New York Times Magazine, I bought the copy in an airport bookstore on my way to meet with the folks at a client I was on the way to visit, only to immediately give away the book to my host there.  I bought another one.  I read it, then re-read it, then wrote two posts on it, \\"A man walks into a bar,\\" and \\"How to be good,\\" If you're curious, you can find them on \\"Adventures in Client Service.\\"<br /><br />There are three things I really like about this book:<br /><br />The first is the stories are great.  All but one chapter begins with one, about people you likely know - Abraham Lincoln, Ken Lay - and people you don't - Peter Audet and Adam Rifkin.  They give life to Grant's data.<br /><br />The second is the sound bites are amazing.  For example, there's this:<br /><br />\\"The takers were black holes.  They sucked the energy from around them.  The givers were suns; they injected light around the organization.  Givers created opportunities for their colleagues to contribute, rather than imposing their ideas and hogging credit for achievements.  When they disagreed with suggestions, givers showed respect for the people who spoke up, rather than belittling them.\\"<br /><br />And this:<br /><br />\\"The greatest untapped source of motivation is a sense of service to others; focusing on the contribution of our work to other peoples' lives has the potential to make us more productive than thinking about helping ourselves.\\"<br />To these I would add this:<br /><br />\\"Although we often stereotype givers as chumps and doormats, they turn out to be surprisingly successful.\\"<br /><br />And this:<br /><br />\\"The takers blamed their partners for failures and claimed credit for successes.  The givers shouldered the blame for failures and gave their partners more credit for successes.\\"<br /><br />My third reason:  of all the stories Grant tells, the story about Don Lane is the one I enjoyed most.  Why?  Don Lane is an ad person,working at Arnold Worldwide, in a business I also happen to be part of.<br /><br />While working on the Volkswagen account, lane came up with the line, \\"Drive it. You'll get it.\\" That became the basis for agency's campaign.  Lane isn't a Creative; he's an account guy, one with a stellar reputation among Creatives.<br /><br />Here's what Grant says about him:<br /><br />\\"Whereas many of his peers had conflicts with creative people, Lane developed a reputation for being a rare account guy with whom creative people enjoyed working.  Instead of seeing him as an outsider stepping on their toes, they saw him as a helpful contributor.\\"<br /><br />Don Lane sounds, at least to me, as someone who read my book, \\"The Art of Client Service,\\" bought into it, and practices its principles.<br /><br />This will sound enormously self-serving, but I think of \\"Give and Take\\" and \\"The Art of Client Service,\\" as highly complementary books that should be read together.  But if I had to make a choice between the two, I would choose \\"Give and Take.\\"<br /><br />The reason?  My book is solid enough; Adam Grant's is groundbreaking.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|It's everything I was looking for in a YouTube app for my Kindle Fire HD. I wonder if some of the 1star reviewers who can't download are using a non HD kindle fire?

B00CL68BK2|5.0|Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were wonderful in the feel good movie.  I also loved Robert De Nero!  Glad we rented it!
B009IEXKXI|3.0|This was the worst case scenario with the best person for the job.  However, most would agree far fetched it still had enough merit as the author did a satisfactory job in the delivery. The main character though extremely technical had a comedic personality that made  the arduous task of telling the story through the eyes of one man interesting and fun.<br />Jared Scott Findel
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|wish there was an easier way to get more pearls without having to buy them and more treasure chests that you can open with sand dollars.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Not too challenging but entertaining enough to pass the time. Fun music and the scenes are nice. Ten levels so far, maybe they get harder as you progress.
B009CG1106|5.0|This is THE best performance I have seen. The young lady who plays Christine gave that character so much more depth. I love the way she plays the final scene with the Phantom, when she gives back the ring. I always wanted that to be hard for Christine's character and this actress does so beautifully!! The man playing the Phantom is just as magnificent!! He gives a tenderness and desperation I've not seen yet. The honorary performances at the end are also wonderful and heartwarming. Thank you Amazon for offering this! My two girls just loved this as did their father and I!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had no idea i would get so into this game. I am going to try some different games by you guys  really enjoyed this game and I want more more more thank you
B00006IX0R|5.0|Great.  Classic 90's that sounds like today a bit O' the oirish too.  I bought the collection because of the wide range of songs from over the years.  I missed hearing The Cranberries.
0312380852|5.0|got this book for the girlfriend, as I have no interest in playing with string. its brilliant, I can sit and watch the football and/or cricket in perfect peace whilst she knots away quite happily for hours. if you have a girlfriend who likes this sort of thing, make sure you insist she keeps the little beads in a box, as they are quite painful to step on. This I know for a fact.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great. I cant wait for more. Will b waiting as patiently as possible. Love these types of games

B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|We enjoyed this very human story.  It had some depth and was a welcome rest from all the shoot-em-ups and horror flicks that flood the movie market.
B00003CXBK|4.0|I like Hayao Miyazaki's work and this was on the deal of the day one day so I decided to get it. It is a good movie.
B000002GVO|4.0|Album Oriented Rock started somewhere in the late 1960s and really took off in the 1970s with bands like Fleetwood Mac, Boston, Deep Purple and a great number of others.<br />The Eagles themselves were already gaining momentum before Hotel California was released in 1976. The success of One Of These Nights from 1975 ensured that the band were being heard far outside of the US, in the UK, for example.<br />For many Hotel California is the zenith of their recordings with some hard rock sounds intersperded with quieter ballards.<br />The title track is a monster of a song from the openning riff, New Kid In Town is not so distinctive, while Life In The Fast Lane reflects the LA lifestyle and Wasted Time is a lovely reflective number.<br />Then a suprising Wasted Time (reprise) which is a short, orchestral piece, this works very well. Victim Of Love is maybe my least preferred track as not very melodic, unlike Pretty Maids Al In A Row and Try To Love Again, both are ballards in which the band excell. Finally The Last Resort is an excellent closer rounding off a recording which has stood the test of time.

B0043RGXJS|5.0|You rarely find someone who combines a beautiful voice with such a degree of technical excellence. Add to that the variety of styles mastered, and Bublé is one of a kind.
B000JIHP88|4.0|I have a 4 year old and he loves the remote that he can use to help turn this on for his baby brother. His brother finds the animals moving to be magic. Easy to set up, doesn't seem to be sucking the life out of the batteries as fast as some of the toys I had for his brother when he was a babe. Super cute in person. =)

014241543X|4.0|If I Stay, by Gayle Forman is about a girl named Mia who gets in a near-fatal car crash that takes the lives of her father, mother and brother.  While unconscious, she experiences a ghost-like out-of-body dream.  She can see and hear who is near her and can also wander around.  Her grandparents, friends and boyfriend, Adam, visit her while she is in the hospital.  She encounters Adam as he breaks into her hospital room.  Mia faces a difficult choice: to stay with her friends in the real world or to join her family in the afterlife.  Kim and Adam never give up hope as they try to bring Mia back.  Kim even yells at her mom, who bursts into tears expecting Mia's death.<br /><br />I liked the story and that it went off topic to explain some key background items, like how she learned to love the cello.  It was the love for cello that brought Adam and Mia together, with a little help from Yo-Yo Ma.  Overall, it was a great story, with an awesome cliffhanger at the end.
B00846REIS|2.0|I couldn't finish this book. I felt like the author just wrote this book for herself and took everything she liked out of fifty shades of grey and then put it in the story without even trying to cover it up. It was poorly done. Also, when reading, I like to relate to the main character, which was really hard to do.
B00D6M86RS|5.0|It's a fun game...liking it so far. Trying to unlock new levels but it's pretty tough. Other than that it's pretty entertaining.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I only bought this book because it was so popular and involved a newsworthy event. I thought I'd be super bored with it because I've never really liked nonfiction books. Also, it's a military book, which made me think it'd be like all other war novels, of which I've already read enough of, but it's not and is action packed! He's got a good voice, too.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|it doesn't work the way you want it to and of course you have to pay real money to unlock everything. don't waste your time.
1451695195|5.0|I promptly ordered 6 copies to give to my children  and people i love - I have read MANY of these books but the fact  Dr.Eben Alexander  is a &#34;HEAD DOCTOR&#34; certianly lends credibilty for  the &#34;hard headed people &#34; i love LOL
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|Good quality. Love the extras, behind the scenes, the author 's inputs and ideas about the films. Good buy for the price.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I loved this movie.  The story was intriguing and it left me for longing more.  I loved being pulled into the adventure of the story without the excessive blood and guts.  After watching this I bought all three books and read them cover to cover.  Cannot wait for the Sequal.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game is so cool I can literaly not put it down I personaly like the battle worn he/she can slash several enemies at one time!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I use this only if I can't get to my stones.  It puts on an OK edge.  Not really that sharp, but sharp enough to cut shit.  I just keep it in my bag and don't take it out.  That way I always have something in there in case I need a quick sharpening.

B00BEXB18M|3.0|Starting with The System has Failed Dave really was knocking it out of the park for four albums straight. United Abominations was also great as well as Endgame and 13. But nothing lasts forever and you can't keep that pace up forever so here we have Super Collider which is an ok album, but for me, not nearly as good as the previous 4. I think the production isn't as good. Dave's voice isn't recorded as good here and for the first time in a long time, Megadeth is lacking inspiration. There are some decent songs on here, but nothing really that makes me go \\"wow!\\".
B0041D843M|5.0|I learned so much!  So many things made sense as I read the book and many misconceptions I had were corrected.  I have put much of the diet advise to work and over the last 6 month I have lowered my cholesterol from 248 to 187 and lost 10 lbs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is awsome because when you get it it starts out boring but it loads updates like when I first got it there was no armor but then I got armor then the next update I got cake ,eggs,milk buckets and this is better than lite versain  cause lite doesn't have beds or updates so I give this 5 stars.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|A funny and touching story about family devotion and mental illness and a love story, too.  Johnny Depp does Charlie Chaplin routines with great aplomb. The entire cast is great :  Johnny Depp, Mary Stuart Masterson, Julianne Moore, Aiden Quinn, Oliver Platt, William H. Macy... what else do you need for a great movie?
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was fun and involving. The only issue I had is that it wasn't long enough. I would have liked it a little longer, but it had enough in it to keep me hooked. I think that is why it needed to be longer because I didn't want it to end.

Saw them on tour last year and was a fantastic show, though it was sad that both Dennis and Carl are no longer with us.<br /><br />They sounded phenomenal, just as if it was the 60's!<br /><br />Wish they had included all the songs they played. That would be my only complaint.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed the levels that were there.  Nice graphics and play.  Good job.  Difficulty level is nice and makes for challenging yet fun game play.
1469220725|5.0|I am not sure why there is such an uproar about the fact that this series is not a trilogy, but will have a couple of more books. I absolutely LOVED this book! I could not put it down, and am now anxiously awaiting the next installment of the series. Gideon and Eva's love story continues and it was as passionate as ever. I especially loved some of the developments towards the end of the novel, and it is awesome to see the progress in Eva and Gideon's relationship. Don't let the fact that there will be a book after this one deter you from reading - it's a great romance novel. The cliffhangers at the end were not the most gripping ever, but I look forward to reading about those developments in the next book. Enjoy!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another winner for this author.. If you want to get to know Afghanistan..read this novel..it  helps to bring the country and the people into your world.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The book was very helpful to me and my word sense. Thank you. It also helped me with several projects and words  I didn't know what the HECK meant. It's also good because it comes on the Kindle Fire automatically and works without Wi-Fi plus it's free. Good book for all your word and definition needs. Kianna James :*<br />P.S<br />Please make more books.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I've heard about this series forever and finally decided to try watching it. I loved it. Really well acted and directed.
B009P3N1GI|4.0|I find Sanderson's magic building to be pretty incredible and the Emperor's Soul is no exception. I love the world building as well as the magic system he used. The story is short and I hope he expands on the world in a future story.<br /><br />Another great bite to tide you over until the next huge novel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really makes you think. the graphics are nicely done.this is a great puzzle game that works flawlessly. I really enjoy it.
B000SEHJGQ|2.0|This recitation of the author’s woes and maltreatment from an abusive father, who today would be jailed for many years for the beatings of his wife and son, was too awful to continue reading. I stopped at about ¼ of the way through the book and don’t know that I will ever go back to it.  Who needs to read this reminiscence about a psychopath parent and the damage done to a child? I read because I want to be entertained, not made sick to my stomach.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This app is A+ Amazing. Downloaded the free version and had to buy the full one. Brandon has been non-stop using my tablet because of this app. I gave it a try and automatically understood his fascination(graphics and illustrations are bright and funny). It has great learning games, that I've noticed have been helping him improve. He's no longer just singing the alphabets, he can now distinguish them from one another.  He is going to be ready for Pre-school in no time. I'm completely stratified with this app...Thank You!! I'll be looking in on all your apps from now on...
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Ok for the yougsters, espec since freebie. Go easy on the throttle until in sync! Not sure how to 'undo' crashes!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|&#34;The Mentalist&#34; is one of my favorite shows on television. Amazon offers these full-season packages at a great price, so whether you love the show too and want it available whenever you want to watch, or you're looking for something new and interesting, I recommend this pack to you. Season 3 contains several memorable episodes, though you may want to begin with Season 1 just to &#34;get&#34; these characters, and the Red John storyline.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Like it a lot. Would give five stars if energy level didn't drop so quickly. My granddaughter likes trying to figure out what to look for when the words are scrambled. Not fond of the constant request to connect to Facebook and Twitter.
0670014893|5.0|I am not a reader of spy or murder mysteries...too much blood and violence.  However I once was persuaded to read John le Carre and became a fan, though not of the genre in general.  I read quite a few of his books and couldn't wait to read this latest.  It's a corker, a page turner, a convincing plot tuned to today's problems, beautifully written.<br />I had just finished reading a non-fiction book on Why the World Exists at All.  This was the perfect return to earth!
B005TBWN0K|4.0|I just started my project of organizing all my house holds and it work good for that and allows me to annotate info to the item.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|I was very very disappointed!<br />This movie had nothing to do with it's title<br />it had no message, and was not funny at all..<br />I was expecting a kind of message that help women cope with the burdens aging<br />and all i found here is sex, bad language, and superficiality ...
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|it is no fun what so ever i would rather work at a real hair salon and cut my cut my finger off<br />well not realy but you get my point
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game.  I do not want to stop playing it.  The levels get harder and harder and harder.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Repeat listening - can't get enough of this cd! Beth Hart has an amazing voice and Joe's guitar playing is off the charts!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was very excited for this book to be released, I pre-ordered it to make sure I could read it right when it was released to my kindle. The book was Okay, it was a very slow read not much excitement/drama as the previous books. Since I had read the first books of the series I felt that Entwined made too much of an effort to talk about the characters and give background. In the end, the book was a slight disappointment.  It left me hanging and I was expecting more to come out since the first two books were great.  When the 4th book is released, I will buy it as I am hooked into the plot and want to see what happens next!  I also read the 50 Shades of Gray series and enjoyed it too. Yes, there are similarities but still not the same.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The way Khalid writes is so poetic and magical. The only thing I didn't like is that I finished reading this book. I wish it had a thousand splendid pages more!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Funny and a little dramatic! Like that it is interesting without getting raunchy, like other lawyer shows.  Hope they keep it going.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Though a bit pricey, my husband and I were looking for a good game to add to our meager collection.  I'd heard of this game from a friend and thought the reviews looked good. We've played it twice - once with 3 people, once with 2 people - and it is great.  Two people is really too few to have an exciting game, but 3 is great.  I'm looking into getting one of the expansion packs so that we can add more players to the game.  Definitely worth the money.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|The Alabama Shakes' album Boys and Girls is a bluesy throwback to the sound of Motown's 60s girl groups. A beautiful blend of blues and rock - tied together by the amazing lead vocals.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This is a great book on body language and the logic behind it. Helps you 'read' people better, including yourself. His other book, Louder Than Words is excellent too.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Great album, have played it over and over, great addition to my CD collection. Also downloaded Skyfall from iTunes. Great
B006LSZECO|3.0|I can't believe I actually finished the book.<br />It dragged most of the time and nothing about the book<br />was exciting.  I really disliked Amy and I think Nick was<br />an idiot for the part he played.
B000025Y9I|5.0|Listened to this on Pandora, have several Chris Rea albums, this is just another great CD for the collection. Recommend it
1781162646|5.0|I really don't know how King does it, again and again turning out a great novel, even when it's rather short. His characters  - both the bad and the good guys - are so true to life and scaringly relatable in many ways.<br />King knows people and humanity and I like that he doesn't shy away from the ugly sides of life and that he, at the same time, has a great love for humans and the utmost respect for their struggles.<br />Though not scary, Joyland provides deep insights and tons of quotable phrases on every page and leaves you teary-eyed with sadness and, yes, joy.
B004RL9T50|5.0|My 8 and 4 year olds as well as myself thought this was hilarious.  We watched it at least twice.  It teaches cute lessons without being overbearing. Really really funny.
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|Sigur Ros is not usually associated with instant gratification, but this record is a little different. From the very first few notes, you're hooked. It is both dark and powerful, but also hopeful and happy. I'm not quite sure if these guys are truly human. People let ego and their conscious desires get in the way of expressing emotion. Not these guys. The music is like a conduit to pure experience.<br /><br />Technically, Kveikur is more focused and \\"song oriented\\" than previous albums. I like it. There is also a bit more prominence of the drums and bass. Jonsi's vocals are much more traditional in that they drive a lyric and the melody of the song as opposed to the texture they provided on Valtari.<br /><br />Honestly though, these guys could record an hour of them blowing their noses and I'd buy it day one. If you're reading this review, you're either a) a Sigur Ros fan already and are just curious what other people thought of the album or b) not a fan, in which case this is a pretty decent place to start.
B001LM1456|4.0|My 4 year old usually watches the Hulk with his father because I was never interested in this ugly monster.  Somehow I ended up watching it and was pleasantly surprised.  There was more of a story than I anticipated.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Excellent writing. You might be surprised and hurt by some of Adichie's scathing observations of American life, but listen to what she says and think deeply about them. You'll be glad you did.
1419707663|5.0|My 8 year old speeds through these books.  He wants to read them once he's done with his homework.  He reads to me sometimes and he and I think these books are hilarious.  Convenient that I was able to buy the first three, since he caught on to the craze so late.  The book holder it comes in is durable and convenient.
B00B2166BS|5.0|It charges much faster than the USB charger does. Really glad it can plug into a USB port too. Simple to use.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|I like it and my husband loves it.  We have rented this before and it was recently on TV.  Husband asked for it so it can watch it multiple times.  If you like Darcula movies you will love this version.  Lots of great stars in it and true to the story.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Jodi Foster is wonderful in this classic film. Great quality, must have addition to anyones DVD collection. Highly recommendable for all.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I have a blast playing this app. I sometimes spend hours playing with it. I especially love the dinosaurs when evolved. They look awesome!
B002BY77CW|4.0|OK, so I am admittedly a fanatic of MTV show The Hills.<br /><br />Don't judge.<br /><br />And I own all the DVD's, and my friend and I started a Hills wisdom quote book-not surprisingly, Justin Bobby is the wisest of the bunch.<br /><br />So, of course, I had to buy star Lauren Conrad's new book (which I am SURE she wrote completely by herself), L.A. Candy. Even though she earned $75,000 per 22-minute episode, I just thought she could use a little extra income as a brand spankin' new writer.<br /><br />The novel is loosely based on her own life as a young female on a reality show that follows life in Los Angeles. And even though I thought I'd be cringing from juvenile writing, I actually really liked the book.<br /><br />It gave a seemingly honest glimpse into what being on a reality show is like-the cast doesn't always get along even though they may smile for the cameras; producers have a role in deciding who the cast's friends and dates are; bosses and teachers primp for the camera; and career advancement may have more to do with the show than with actual talent.<br /><br />To read this coming from the person who has, in my opinion, tried to pass The Hills off as pure reality, is a pleasant surprise. Conrad's actual leveling with us-maybe it's because she's no longer on the show, whose fifth season debuts this September.<br /><br />If you're a Hills addict like me, L.A. Candy is a fun, breezy read that will keep your superficial needs met until the new shows. And if you, like many of my friends, can't stand the thought of watching The Hills, then don't bother even picking it up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is loads of fun, it keeps you guessing through each door and it is definitely not boring. I love it!
0345803485|5.0|The books is well written . . . .very descriptive.  So far I have read about a fourth of the book.  I am sure that I will buy the other sequels.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It was very thought-provoking.  Fun and frustrating at the same time.  Would recommend  this game for anyone who likes a challenge.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I wanted a good mystery but I am not into the supernatural.  I started out interesting until I realized what it was based on
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|Nice little way of making a short story into a movie that involves jack not stealing the golden goose but instead being romantic with an adventureous princess against giants.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A lot like the Nancy drew games grew up playing. Big fan also challenging when it needs to be. Get it!!!
B00C7DGRL4|2.0|Ok the show is great til it goes to the part where it gets to the hidden history about the mother which to me made the great moving showing into a uhhh ok whatever.  I like fantasy just not a crappy background for the characters.  Love mystery.  Makes stories great but the mystery of handsel and Gretel background I would say the writer lacks imaginations and is boring in idea on background for characters.  Not really realistic as far as linking their mom mysterious background.  Too be honest if they just left it a mystery or wrote a better history the show be a 5 star I nearly put 1 star because it was just too crappy of a background.  Love story plots.  Show was fun but it really messed up the story.
B007N85POS|5.0|Very, very good graphics, nice extras, fun to play as all of the angry birds are. Would be a fun game for everyone.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|hmm which is the hero.  The horse with a sword, the thief that gets in over his head or the long gold hair beauty who isn't to be taken lightly. hehe.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|when I try to install it it says : can not install vtube I mean seriously,  I use my phone to look at youtube vids - but,  to be honest this app sucks
B00CBRADU2|4.0|Not used to Arnold playing this kind of character.  Though the actions part is the norm but fun.  A Sheriff with a history that he wishes to keep behind him and live a quiet life in a small town. muahahah surprise surprise its the good guys vs organize crime (an oldy but of a favorite theme of mine)
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This was the main reason I bought Amazon Prime - so I could watch Falling Skies.  This is an outstanding show, with strong lead actors carrying most of the weight for the noobs on the screen.  Some of the acting is contrived, but to be expected with the age of many of the actors.  Overall, 5 stars!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Love this movie.  Enjoy it with mom and family.  Show about a evil villain who gets involved with 3 lovable little orphan girls.
B000IONJJ2|5.0|Classic brit-style comedy featuring Jamie Curtis and John Cleese. One of my top favorites! Kevin Klein is priceless as ex CIA turned thief.
B000059MEK|5.0|I love anything Daft Punk and collect their albums.  They have a musical sense that few can match and reach out to other musicians to make their music that much better.
B00821OX98|5.0|just something that I needed to see in a series glad that I watched it and will continue to watch all of it that I can
B00847KFDS|1.0|It must be stated, I love John Fogerty, a consummate musician/songwriter, the very essence of Creedance.  And his first two solo albums, along with Tina Turner's revival, and the group Big Daddy, almost disproved my conjecture that the interbreeding of \\"disco\\" and \\"punk,\\" created the VILE entity known as \\"new wave\\" that killed off Rock and Roll by the eighties.  The operative word in the last sentence is \\"almost.\\"  JC displays that...hypothesis on \\"Wrote A Song,\\" because, despite having guest artists like Bob Segar & Kid Rock, JC seems to feel that everyone of the Baby Boomer generation suffers the same affliction known as \\"liberal guilt\\" like HE does.  Like you yourself said in \\"Fortunate Son,\\" man, \\"It ain't me...it ain't me.\\"  You absolutely RUINED \\"Wrote A Song,\\" blah-blah-blah, by being a good liberal whiner, and  milking \\"Song\\" for a (AHEM) \\"different interpretation.\\" If your brother Tom was still around, I do believe he'd want to rub your nose in the dirt (for lack of anything else \\"printable\\") for trotting out Tom Morello, the guitarist for the ultimate \\"Karl Marx Is Not Dead\\" band (sic) \\"Rage Against The Machine.\\"  I mean, how far do you rancid liberals want to go? And John, man, you've just done lost it: what are you going to do on your next CD, your rendition of, what, Joan Baez' \\"greatest hitz,\\" with that Russian \\"punk\\" band, \\"Pu**y Riot\\" singing?
B000JQU1VS|5.0|If you are a Sherlock holmes fan, just do yourself a favor and get this book! I love the relationship between holmes and watson. Very well written series of shortstories.
B000FC130E|5.0|Modern day fairytale from Neil Gaiman. He has a way of making the modern day fairy tale work. The book is a quick read and highly enjoyable. Not quite to American Gods standards but if you liked that book you will most likely like this one as well.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This was a fantastic film. Easy watching, great story line. Have watched it over and over. Hope there is a sequel to follow!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Very good story. \\"Pidge\\" and Travis are sweetly dysfunctional but crazy funny. I cant help but wonder what is next for them. Dull moments for these two is nonexistent. Definitely a good read. I would encourage anyone who wants to laugh and cry at the same time to buy this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i love it! i just wish there were more levels. lots of fun but the available levels get beat way too fast
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book Wonder because it showed that a kid named August has disabilities and he's been home schooled throughout his life and he is finally ready to go to a real school . He gets bullied throughout the school year but he starts to  make friends. At the end some kids learn a lesson that even though somebody might not be as popular as somebody else or might even look different you should still be nice.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album rocks, not listening to it is a crime against humanity.  Download it now, listen to it all day, rock out.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Wow.  Just watched season 8.  It was amazing.  It is the best season of \\"24\\", and a terrific ending to a wonderful series. I have enjoyed every season.  Kiefer Sutherland is a terrific actor.  The entire cast did an amazing job (they're all good actors) - I really loved Freddie Prinze Jr.  Great writing, a lot of action and so many twists and turns.<br /><br />I was happy to read that in 2014 they will be bringing this series back (for 12 episodes instead of the usual 24).  Not sure if they will go through with it because I read they are no longer planning a 24 movie (so they could decide not to film another season).  If it does happen, I can't wait to see what they have in store for Jack....I'm sure it will be just as good as the previous seasons.  I will miss this show so much - it has given me hours of great entertainment.  It's the best tv series I have ever watched.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I really enjoy watching this series.  I am about half-way through the first season and find every<br />episode entertaining.  Casting is great.
193700788X|5.0|I really love that Charlaine Harris ended her series when and as she did with this novel. Yeah, I'm going to miss these characters, but I'm not left mourning them because Harris suggests that they're still out there, living their lives and having more adventures. Sookie has always struck me as such a strong, basically positive person, who doesn't just stand by letting the world beat her down, and in the end, I think she stays true to form. Bad things happen, Sookie suffers, but she deals with it and appreciates the people who stand by her and help her through.<br /><br />As for the final romance, I can't say I'm surprised or disappointed; the series has been gradually building up to it for years, and he's a character I've always liked--even when he wasn't always one whose choices I could admire. I'd like to think that, if the two of them remain together, they will have a relationship based on true friendship and mutual respect and that theirs will be a relationship of equals.<br /><br />For me, however, this series isn't really about the romance. By the time I got to the end of the book, I didn't really care if Harris paired Sookie up with anyone because I realized it's Sookie herself who matters to me. For me, the series is about Sookie the individual, not Sookie the girlfriend of ______. It's about the person she was and the person she becomes as she deals with the weird and sometimes horrible things that come her way. No, the world doesn't suddenly become a perfect place at the end of the series, nor is Sookie suddenly living a perfect life. She's not even a perfect character any more than she was at the beginning. But she's definitely grown and become stronger and more independent, and I trust that, whatever comes her way, she'll be able to deal with it. Personally, I think she's done pretty well for herself, and I think Charlaine Harris has done pretty well for us.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|I'm a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and had never read anything about the film. I found all the performances to be just enough to not be sappy and whinny about the issue of friendship and facing death. Well done. And I love that this was done by a female director.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book puts you into the middle of the action and how we could very well act in a zombie world.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|I play this disc over and over and over again.  It's so alive!  I especially love the uncut version. RIP  Jim.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I am so glad there is a great superhero show that is compelling and not fluffy, even though it's on one of the most one dimensional networks out there. Stephen Amell is a fantastic choice for Green Arrow. And the supporting cast is very nice too.  I also like that there is more than one person of color in the main cast.  The networks still have a problem with this.  But that is besides the point.  Green Arrow, great show!!!
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Love the HP series, thought I was buying the American version but got the British one instead.  No big deal just some of the names are changed like philosophers stone instead of scorers stone.
B00785P2QC|5.0|. I t think this is a good game.you use your skills of layouts to design yourcity. It takes time but is all good.have a go and see what you think
B003R1B9MW|4.0|This was a feel-good true story, great for those that love the game of golf, or love to cheer for the underdog.  No violence, language, or sex, just good entertainment.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|My sister in law recommended this book.  We both are healthcare professionals... so we could relate to many of the topics discussed.  It was one of those books I didn't want to put down!
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|I felt that the execution of the movie was professional, and complete. However, 3 stars because I felt that Ryan Gosling and Emma stone's role wasn't the right match for them both. they look more from this century not the 1920's! But over all, it was a great movie and worth the money that I paid for it!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Game freezes too much. Can't collect items from treasure chest because of it freezing. If they fix the problems would be a much better game.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Reading the first two books of the series I was expecting something amazing. Now I loved the content but the writing could have been much better. She could have taken the material and really had something miraculous, instead she jumped around and the ending was so disappointing! I was a little angry with it and wished I could have told her that as well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great fun critical thinking game. Thank goodness for cheats.....they help a lot! Would recommend game to anyone looking for a challenge. Very addictive
B006GWO5NE|1.0|This cord did not fix my problem on my Kindle Fire. My Kindle will not charge due to a &#34;wallowed out&#34; receptical on the Kindle Fire.

1623420148|5.0|This book was great, it had the perfect amount of romance, humor, & emotion for a book with only less than 260 pages...!
B00BNWWUDY|5.0|this is a great movie with an amazing turn around you kind of think you know whats going on, but you really dont there is some lesbian stuff & everything spoiler! you will be at the edge of your seat it keeps you wanting more & poor channing tatum lol
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm a self described geek/nerd that loves all the 80s cult classics and this book just keeps the references coming. The story line and character development are also top notch.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved the first one and loved this book. I can't wait to see what secrets get unveiled next. Left me wanting more.
B002Z5FM74|5.0|i love this flash drive, i definitely recommend it to anyone buying one, the only problem i can say i have with it is that i bought a one gig years ago, which a gf dispossessed me of, same brand and it came with a lanyard and that still works.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was a very good product.I don't have a big score but I still like the game.there some things you should change.I was just taking about how it's good now I want you to change some stuff.
B006K1IIAC|5.0|It didn't work for my TV due to my little knowledge of region codes, I needed a 1 and bought a 2. But they shipped it very quickly and were nice about my return. Would buy from them again in a heartbeat :)
B00CFA222M|5.0|An absolutely delightful new take on the old fairy tale that every childs been read!!! There are parts that are a little too gory for children under age 10 or so and so I can't recommend for very young children, but for the older child, and the inner child in every adult, this movie is definitely a must see!
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|this is fun!! I like cutting styling hair. groooming hair is so much fun. I think more people should play this amazing fun game
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think subway surfers is o.k.:)<br /><br />Harley Rules<br />Yyyyyyaaaaaaaaaa yaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh sub surf is the nickname I think in is for this be and after a while it gets so boring I almost fall asleep.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun easy game to pass the time. SImilar to 100 doors.<br />Encourages memory skills with numbers and Colorado to solve puzzle.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Free and effective with customizable alerts alerts for remaining battery power. Easy to use and is aesthetically appealing as well. I'm not particularly high tech, so really grateful for straightforward product. Worth every penny!
B000FA675C|5.0|Easily the best book I have ever read. This masterpiece has shook me to the core with suspense and detailed action. I highly recommend it.
B000M341QE|4.0|This is a L-O-N-G movie, but it keeps moving through most of it. There is a lot of action that will keep you entertained. Most of the acting is pretty good, but some of the dialog is weird and delivered in an unnatural way. It's violent, bloody, and there is a whole lot of unnecessary cursing. It leads to a surprising ending with loose ends. That is what I didn't like about it. It takes me all this way to leave me with loose ends. That was a disappointment. It's like it's your birthday. There is this huge, wonderfully decorated box. The fireworks go off just as you open it, and then there is this itty bitty insignificant thing inside.
0679805273|5.0|Well, I've already said it all, it's a great book for all ages.  Initially, I was getting this book for my son who graduated from high school, but somebody else did, so I'm saving it for another opportunity.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|ANTHEM, arriving in the 21st year of Hanson history, plays big, REAL big.  Right from the get-go you are bombarded with the idea that this band wants you to live life with a passion and a purpose.  Make that dream a reality and, oh by the way, do it today because tomorrow may be a day too late; a mantra that these three brothers live by.  That take charge attitude has never been more evident than right here.<br /><br />I can honestly say that this album showcases Hanson at the top of their game.  Each track is markedly different, but all reflect the spot-on multi-talented musicality of this band.  Starting out so young has given these three plenty of time to hone their skills, and hone them they have.  Never forgetting the tunes they grew up on, Hanson tapped into that knowledge and set out to produce an album that would be, well, anthemic!  ...An album that paid homage to everyone from early Motown and Stax Records greats to Michael Jackson, AC/DC, Queen and U2.  My antenna even picked up a few Dire Straits references, (but I'm sure that's just me).<br /><br />Anyway, here's a quick rundown of the tracks (in no particular order):<br /><br />Driving drum beats and soaring guitars add to the \\"take no prisoners\\" approach of \\"Fired Up\\" and \\"You Can't Stop Us\\".  I swear Taylor is channeling Bono in \\"Fired Up\\", and you just can't miss the AC/DC connection.  There are some very cool atmospheric sounds and a \\"Money For Nothing\\" style build up on \\"You Can't Stop Us\\".  Zac starts this one off, but each brother sings a verse.  These songs play big and loud!  I love 'em!  These two could be used at motivational conferences!  Whew!  (Note: Fox Sports used a video featuring Hanson and \\"Fired Up\\" for its telecasts of Oklahoma City Thunder basketball games and ESPN uses \\"You Can't Stop Us\\" during its NASCAR coverage.  They couldn't possibly have made better musical choices!)<br /><br />Taylor has the perfect voice to give both \\"I've Got Soul\\" and \\"Tragic Symphony\\" a Michael Jackson-worthy groove.  (He most certainly does have soul, and has proven time and again that he knows how to use it!)  There's a great retro horn arrangement and lots of James Brown-esque funk on \\"I've Got Soul\\".  Michael Fitzpatrick of Fitz and The Tantrums is a guest vocalist on this track.  (Joe Karnes of Fitz and The Tantrums also lends a hand with bass on quite a few of the tracks.)  \\"Tragic Symphony\\" is jaw-droppingly great!  Love the prominent B3 here (not to mention the guitar and drums!)  If these songs fail to get you up off your chair then, I regret to inform you,...you are probably dead.<br /><br />\\"Juliet\\", \\"For Your Love\\" and \\"Lost Without You\\" are all love songs (one per Hanson brother).  Zac sings lead on \\"Juliet\\" which is a spin on the Shakespeare play.  Romeo is so taken with his love for Juliet that he can barely speak her name.  Very, very charming and sweet.  \\"For Your Love\\" is sung by Isaac who also plays mandolin on this track.  A beautiful song with stunning vocals and lyrics.  (Inspired by The Princess Bride, maybe?)  Taylor's track, \\"Lost Without You\\" is an absolute musical masterpiece.  From the drum beats to the guitar, organ and vocals...perfection.  I love the use of the words \\"the unexpected beautiful\\".  This song truly showcases what Hanson is all about.<br /><br />\\"Get the Girl Back\\" is the first single released on this album.  It brings back the horns from their previous album SHOUT IT OUT, and kind of acts as a bridge between the two.  Tayor has lead vocals on this not-to-be-missed Motown inspired, rousing, danceable track.  (Be sure to check out the video for this song on YouTube featuring Kat Dennings and Nikki Reed.)<br /><br />Taylor takes the lead on these next three songs.  \\"Already Home\\" makes a bold statement that urges you to stop looking, maybe you've already found what you seek.  Love the drums, guitar, B3, ooooohs and ohs.  Awesome!  \\"Cut Right Through Me\\" sounds (to me, anyway) like a song that would not have been out of place on a Tinted Windows album.  (Actually, I even hear a little Weezer in this one.)  Power pop at its best.  I like it!  \\"Tonight\\" is a piano driven track with some interesting lyrics that recall Hanson tunes from albums past.  Very clever writing, here.<br /><br />Zac has lead vocals on \\"Scream and Be Free\\".  In a nutshell, this song exemplifies the theme of the album (as does the aforementioned \\"Tonight\\")... Live life to the fullest, and do it now.  From the jangly guitar to the drums, organ and excellent vocals, this one's a keeper!<br /><br />And, once again, Zac sings lead on the encore (song number 13...which is actually track 21 on the physical CD).  I affectionately refer to this as the \\"Man from Milwaukee\\" position.  (Anyone who owns Hanson's MIDDLE OF NOWHERE knows what I'm talking about.)  \\"Save Me from Myself\\" is a melancholy ballad about love lost.  There's a bit of self loathing here (...What's wrong with me?...How could I have done that?) which we all experience from time to time.  I love the lyrics \\"'Cause I keep making waves and falling victim to the swell\\".  The accordion (played by Yuri Lemeshev of Gogol Bordello) adds poignancy to this piano driven track.  Absolutely, hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />So there you have it. This collection of songs borrows from the past, but is unmistakably Hanson, just a bit more of them.  The flawless vocals and harmony along with the undeniable musicianship you've come to expect from this band are still there, but in a super-sized version.  Hanson Grande!  If you only buy one album this year, ANTHEM should be it!  This is quality from top to bottom.  No filler...no skip-overs...just pure AWESOME!!!  And don't forget to catch Hanson on tour!

B009XIXVU6|4.0|This was a fascinating story which held my attention. I had been warned that the characters became confusing later in the story. I had my doubts but, sure enough half way through,things got pretty complicated.  I had hoped for a more uplifting ending, but his talents reside in reality. This boom does paint excellent pictures of family lives and stresses .  It was well worth the time spent reading it.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book captured my attention from the very beginning. I finished reading this book in less than a week, which is very unusual for me. All I can say is,  I will  definitely recommend this book to others. Great story line and ending. A must read!

030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn's latest novel, Gone Girl, is what all psychological novels should be--a brilliant page-turner that makes the reader look askance at anyone resembling anyone in the novel!<br /><br />On the surface Nick and Amy appear to be marvelously suited for each other.  They're the beautiful people, almost too gorgeous to be true, living the high life in New York City.  Nick is a successful writer for a magazine, a poor boy making good.  Amy is \\"Amazing Amy,\\" the subject of her author-parents' series of children's books that have made them extremely wealthy and given Amy the comfort of a significant trust fund while she works writing short psychological quizzes for women's magazines.<br /><br />They answer the \\"What's missing?\\" in each other's life, and had economic times been better they would have had--at least from a distanced perspective--the relationship about which fairy tales are made.<br /><br />But there are always problems in fairy tales, and both Nick and Amy lose their jobs as their companies cut back, and they return to Nick's Missouri town to help his sister, Go, take care of their failing mother and ailing father.<br /><br />When Amy goes missing, there is just enough of a chink in Nick's reaction to make the reader sit a bit straighter and continue to read.  True, he has already admitted he is someone incapable of fully displaying his feelings, but his involvement with the police and the search is just a touch off.<br /><br />I think the novel begins to coast a bit as the search continues and we gain insight into the other players, but not enough to have me swim away. Flynn is baiting me, and she neatly sets the hook in the second section, ratchets up the tension, increases the speed of the story, and would have had me reading non-stop until the end had I the free time!<br /><br />At first, Flynn uses Amy's diary to introduce us to her character.  It's a nice literary technique, and she alternates the diary entries with the reality of the search.  Allowing Amy to talk to the readers works so well because Nick's character is always with us and speaking in the first person.  We are not being influenced by an outside narrator who would not have intimate access to everything the characters think.  I enjoyed this immensely.<br /><br />I'm not going to add any spoilers here.  You've got to read this thriller and move with Gillian Flynn's very fleshed-out characters, Nick and Amy, as well as Nick's twin, Go, Amy's author-parents, the very interesting police on the case, and a few others whose appearances and actions might surprise you.<br /><br />I borrowed Gone Girl from my local library for my Kindle, but using the app on my phone, I would pull it out at every free moment to see what happened next.  The chapters are short, so it was easy to keep it all together.  Next time I am in the mood for a light read--a vacation page turner--I might choose another of Gillian Flynn's books.  But this one I vigorously recommend.Allowing Amy to talk to the readers works so well because Nick's character is always with us and speaking in the first person.

One that cannot be overlooked. Too bad. I used to like Madonna. I guess there was a reason I hadn't bought anything of hers in a long time. Oh well. Live and learn. Time to move on.

B00BTHWFBK|4.0|First I've been a Sabbath fan since day one. So please do not think I am ripping on Sabbath. It breaks my heart to give the Gods anything less than a 5 but.....<br /><br />I really did like the instrumentation in this album but the vocals are boring and tired. The singing by Ozzy reminded me of a grade school music class where you were singing some words off a card and really did not want to be there. Just going through the motions.<br /><br />Tony could take any song and make a diamond out of it. He is fantastic on this album as usual. Geezer is awesome as well. Good tight drumming finishes this lineup.<br /><br />If I could dub the vocals out of this album it would be great. Since Dio is gone I'm not sure what options Sabbath would have for a vocalist. Maybe Ian Gillan ?<br /><br />I would recommend this album to everyone as it is the evolving Sabbath but Ozzy needs to drink some coffee, Monster or Red Bull on the next album.<br /><br />Long Live Sabbath !!

1781162646|5.0|This book was a joy to read. Not as thick as a lot of Mr King's books but still a tight plot and excellent writing. It's not a horror book but more of the style of the pulp fiction/mystery that harkens back to the 1950's era. A great summer read.

0765325950|5.0|Well, all things considered I am very pleased with the book overall and felt the ending gave me the closure<br />that I wanted though not what I was expecting! I also feel that B. Sanderson did an excellent job finishing<br />the series considering the pressure I'm sure he was under.<br /><br />To be quite honest, I'll miss the characters and their adventures as Mr. Jordan did such an excellent job<br />of bringing each one to life. That being said, my recommendation to those who haven't read the books is<br />to start at the beginning and be prepared to be drawn into the world that (in great detail) Mr. Jordan created<br />to the delight of those who love fantasy.<br /><br />My fondest hope is that the books will be made into movies or a really good tv series on the scale of Game of Thrones!<br /><br />Good luck and happy reading :)
B005NFWCSK|1.0|If Amazon is having a problem with delivering the product they should not charge you before hand.  Was told there was a problem getting me this video, but they charged me anyway, that's crappy.

0385343248|3.0|I tried to love this book. But, I could not. The writing was so tedious throughout most of the book; the story moved so slowly at times. There would be quick-moving, exciting parts in the book and I would get revved up...and then...back to more tiresome, overly-detailed descriptions and story-telling. It was difficult to connect with the characters, and I still did not get a good understanding of each character's true persona at the end. Speaking of the end...what kind of an ending was that?!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 has some war scenes which I do not like to watch because war is such a devastating experience for so many military persons and their families.  However, the scenes are not too long and they are an integral part of the story so one must watch the season in its entirety.<br /><br />Again, the acting is superb and the characters believable in every way.
B005MLW8DO|2.0|Very fuzzy and not clear at all. Very disappointed, have never experienced this before and hopefully never will again, thanks.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As of this date I have watched only half of Season 3.  I am a glutton for this show and actually want to just sit down and watch the entire season in one day.  However, time and responsibility do not allow me to do that.  Instead I use the episodes as a daily reward for accomplishing all of my to-do list.<br /><br />Downton Abbey is truly one of the best series I have had the good fortune to watch.  I wish it would go on forever.
B000BNI90O|5.0|The first observation passers-by will notice is the high price tag on this set. I cringed as much as the rest of you, but consider how much more music you're getting! This is a 3-disc set (not including the DVD, which we'll analyze later). Many songs are entirely new, and those that aren't are often lengthy extensions of the versions heard on the standard soundtrack. These are not mock-ups or slightly alternate takes. Every track is glorious orchestral ear candy, capably played and capably recorded/mastered. The choral parts are even more mysterious, the brass is doubly noble, the rustic violin and mischievous folk woodwinds are even more hobbit-esque. I never pay big money for a soundtrack, but this was one of the rare exceptions, and I'm so glad I did! Assuming you're actually a fan of this music, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />In the LOTR trilogy, I enjoyed the FOTR film best, and that's ultimately true of the soundtracks as well. There is a certain lush, pastoral quality in FOTR's music that is quite unlike the other two installments (which are equally good, but in very different ways). FOTR has the most variety of upbeat melodies, and also seems to spend the most time on obvious Elvish themes. If you bought the extended editions of the LOTR movies, you'll know that much (but maybe not all) of this \\"extra\\" music can be found in the longer versions of the movies, and you'll also know how well it enhances them. Yet this music also enhances *itself* by being more in-depth. Why? Well, some music simply improves by having \\"breathing room\\" (basically more time within a song to develop/express themes, add to compositional ideas, and/or let the performance properly build and climax). There was really nothing wrong with the standard theatrical soundtracks, but there is so much more additional material here.<br /><br />Now a word about the audio DVD. The general quality is very good, but a little wasted on me personally. I have keen hearing, but I don't care much about the super-duper enhanced sound options on this disc because the music was recorded so well in the first place. I appreciate the added definition, but it's not essential to this being good music. Audio DVDs have not, by and large, caught on well with the public since they were introduced a few years ago - perhaps because of the extra cost, or perhaps only because not everyone can stay glued to their DVD player just to listen to music. As a consumer, the inclusion of this audio DVD would not have been the do-or-die reason that pushed me to buying (or not buying) the set. I would have been just as happy if they had left it out and made this reduction reflect in the overall retail price. However, it does make a nice addition to an already fine set when all's said and done. I suppose the mentality was that if people were going to hand over good money for this set, they might as well get a bonus little \\"gimme.\\" For me, the chief advantage of this other disc is that the complete music is included, so I don't have to switch discs out as they play through. It's also nice that there are on-screen helps for the track titles/numbering.<br /><br />The packaging is cute and looks pretty, although like others have noted, the DVD is precariously held in place by a funny little rubber hub (which could break off at any time) attached to the box \\"cover.\\" The first time I took the DVD out, I was quite worried I would crack the disc in the process. No more! It now goes in a soft cloth sleeve (the box is big enough inside to comfortably allow for this adjustment). As for the liner notes, musicians will enjoy the lengthy analysis of the music. The only way they could have improved it was to actually include the sung texts, which seems to be a pretty sloppy oversight considering the overall detail that went into other aspects of this set. At present, the only reliable source for all the lyrics from the films is in the Doug Adams book [[ASIN:0739071572 The Music of The Lord of the Rings Films: A Comprehensive Account of Howard Shore's Scores (Book and Rarities CD)]] (which is worth considering if you're already committed enough to want one of these \\"Complete Recordings\\" CD sets).<br /><br />This is superb music if you can get your hands on it!
B0050PYNOY|5.0|If you can't follow dialog and aren't familiar with Danny McBride's sense of humor, you won't get it. Mixing the old fashion snobbish Renaissance style movies with modern reactions & expressions while staying in Renaissance character was pure genius.<br />Whenever a writer experiments with a new idea, like Mel Brooks early films, \\"Young Frankenstein & Blazing Saddles\\", it's a 50-50 chance you'll get mix reviews. This is a comedy movie, meaning it's time to have some fun. Not look at everything like a spectator taking everything so serious. The movie is not for family viewing or people who can't stomach a cuss word or two. That's why it was rated R. Too many funny quotes to post from this movie to mention.<br />This movie was extremely funny from start to finish and perfectly cast as well.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|how the game is played - politics.  disturbing in itself but Lincoln used the game to our benefit - at a cost.  great to see how it happened.  Daniel Day-Lewis - as always - a master.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome game!  I need more levels!  absolutely love it.  a great brain teaser.  fun fun fun what more can I say
B000005IZ8|4.0|This is the soundtrack for the second of three film projects where music was composed by Philip Glass. Koyaanisqatsi was the first and I like the music from that film better than this and Naqoyqatsi was the third film and Glass wrote in a cello part which was performed by Yo Yo Ma. The third effort, Naqoyqatsi, was my favorite. I am pleased to have all three as a complete collection.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|I bought this unit based on good reviews, and at first i was very impressed. That was, until one night it died. Thinking it needed battery, I just hooked it up to the charger overnight. The next day, I went to check on it again. The volume was about 1/6 max of what it used to be. I have yet to find a solution to my problem.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is a must have for kids or anyone working with fractions!  The added feature showing answers in decimals makes this exceptional!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Love this movie. I am a sci-fi nut and this movie hit the target in just about every single way with me. Definitely in the top 3 for best movies imho. DTS HD Master Audio is phenominal on a good surround system, combined with the 1080p picture and visuals, I dont think this can be beat in the quality of the content. The extra's in the collector's edition are great editions to behind the scenes looks and author/director mindset. Space Sci-Fi / Other Planets, Advanced technology, Romance, Compassion, and the fact that it frames humans in the perfect light of what we could become on both the good and bad side makes for a truly awesome story, as well as deeper meaning and thoughtful reflection on our species as a whole. James Cameron and James Horner hit a grand slam with this one, I hope there is more in store.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a great squeal to the hunger games I loved it and it should be in Your library soo
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This is by far my least favorite book of the series.  In fact, I think you could even do without this book and still enjoy the series.  Without going into details that will spoil the events contained within the book, I will simply state the following:<br />1)  the book seems rushed; there is far too much narration for my liking and the author skirts over large chunks of time on many occasions.  The timeline could have easily been condensed, and large portions of the book could have been removed in favor of elaborating on more important sections.<br />2)  along the same lines as point two, the writing often seems disjointed and can be difficult to follow.<br />3)  many of the &#34;negative events&#34; were unnecessary to the message of the book - the authors ending &#34;message&#34; could have been delivered quite as effectively without these occurrences.<br />4)  the relationship development/&#34;re-development&#34; between the characters was lacking.<br /><br />All in all, although I was fairly satisfied with the conclusion, the author's journey there seemed hasty -- which left me feeling dissatisfied with the book overall.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|The actors are top notch performers and this period piece it perfect in its depiction of Jane Austen's England.  Great story and Ciaran Hinds appeals to both the women and men in his depiction of Captain Wentworth.  A feast for the eyes!
B0091LS07E|2.0|Not Alicia's best effort, and not worth the wait. This album is underdeveloped, and sounds dated. Who else is bored with her lack of creativity? Her attempt at recording 'real' music is appreciated, but is generally not good quality music. Had any of the songs from this album been released during the time in which they sound the result would [still] be considered mediocre. I think she has the idea that 'old school sounds' are a leg to stand on -- as if 'this sound', alone,  is enough to carry on an album, and not the quality of it. This collection showcases none of her abilities as a note-worthy musician. Most of her audience will accept her work based on brand, [again] not quality. An unknown artist could release this offering, and there would be no buzz. The album is boring. The 'Girl on fire-sound' has already been done better by other artists, years ago. It's a new century, there are enough references throughout the history of music  for our current artists to be inspired by. If there's anything lovely to say about this album it would pertain to the design of the artwork and logo; simply divine but, does nothing for the music ;-)
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|The time travel part of the game was fun. Well the time travel part is all of the game. I've only played 15 levels though. But it is AWESOME
B004GYY714|5.0|Got this free app for my Kindle Fire HD-Had my favorite local radio station on it! So convient to use around the house instead of a regular radio! Comes in perfectly!
B00D3V8PSC|4.0|It's good to hear the Oz man back where he belongs.  Black Sabbath finally sounds like Black Sabbath again. The song &#34;End of the Beginning&#34; sounds very similar to the song &#34;Black Sabbath&#34;.  Overall, I think &#34;13&#34; is a really good album.  Long overdue.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Got this free app for my Kindle Fire HD! It works great! will light up the whole room! Recently used on camping trip! Perfect!
0061780308|4.0|I felt like I was reading Erich Segal's 'Love Story' as seen through the eyes of a dog.  I mean this as the highest of compliments.  This book makes you laugh uncontrollably one minute, then punches you in the gut the next.  I am a very critical motorsport enthusiast (understatement).  Garth Stein uses this motor racing backdrop as a vehicle to deliver his story in the most innovative manner imaginable.  If you have emotions, you will definitely laugh, cry, and think deeply about life in reading a novel that is both deep and light-hearted.  And it is a dog that has got you going through all your emotions ....that's the best part!
B00847KFDS|5.0|i saw John on a talk show and hadn't thought of CCR in years! Loved their music! This CD is so fun to listen to-he has other artist singing some of his old hits!  Again very fun!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I found myself wanting to know more about Victoria and why she slipped through the system so difficultly.  She's a survivor, but surviving has cost her a lot in her inability to trust, her anger, and how she discovers her salvation.  There were places when I just wanted to shake her and tell her to &#34;get over it&#34;, other places where I wanted to throw the book across the room (but couldn't because I read it on my kindle), and times when I just needed to set it aside to sort through how the book made me feel.  Any book that can bring out those kind of emotions in me is worth reading.  Plus it had the added pleasure of learning about flowers and their meanings.  A great  read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun app. Makes you think out side the box while figuring the puzzle out. will play again. when more rooms become available for play.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard about this series for a while. I'm glad I finally watched it and am looking forward to watching the rest of them!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The puzzles are fun and challenging enough that you do not go crazy by trying to find the answer and yet they are fun to do as the puzzles are set in fun environments. Great game overall, just too short for my own puzzly addiction, which is a good thing.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|i do enjoy this game it is fun to play and i sometimes need help from my granddaughter she is good at it too
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This movie is a favorite of me and my husband it came when expected and was great quality. We watch it all the time
B008US4PBY|5.0|I ordered this sometime ago and it has worked for me. At first, I had a little bit of problem syncing it together with my Ps3 controller and Xbox 360 but after looking at some walkthroughs on youtube, I was able to sync and configure my cronus device together with my Ps3 controller. You might need to play around with the configuration software in order to get which setting you need. I have yet to try it on my laptop
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I recommend this game to anyone who needs to conquer boredom. you will be entertained for a while, at least until the levels run out.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Not having used fractions for a long time and with a child who is learning them this app is great.<br />Now I can check homework faster and know that I made no mistakes.  It automaticly reduces fractions to the lowest common denominator and showes the decimal conversion above your answer.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|A little hard to control at times but it's entertaining and fun. I'd say try it out since it's free. :)
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Learned much of thr world war 1 and how it came to be.  The story line follows history well.  Much study to research the facts
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this app I have it on my iPhone and my kindle fire HD and its perfect and I've never once paid anything to keep playing or to level up I'm hooked on it
B004RKXHZY|5.0|Another amazing book by Stephanie Perkins!<br /><br />When I first started reading I was unsure. I didn't like Lola and before I read the backstory I really did not like Cricket. As soon as I read the back story, however, I knew I needed to know more.<br /><br />I also loved Anna and the French Kiss and it was great to follow up with the protagonists from that novel while reading this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really fun...if u like mission game like temple run you will love subway surfers...i love the challenges because youdont just run from the security guard you have to complete missions on the way youll be happy with this game but dont just take my word for it check the game out yourself
B0044AEBXY|5.0|Great music as usual by Genesis.  Granted I am biased, but it's difficult to give a less that stellar review to these brilliant musicians.  If you're not already a fan, you must give this group a try.
B003VBVQKS|3.0|F2*<br /><br />Come Taste the Band was effectively a last-ditch attempt to keep things going as the band broke up. They brought in talented guitarist Tommy Bolin to replace Ritchie Blackmore, and he did a decent job, but it wasn't even close to the same thing.<br />Bolin was also a decent singer, but the last thing a band with David Coverdale in it was another singer. And Bolin's guitar talent, while impressive, was of a completely different style than the band played in.<br /><br />Some people like this album a lot, but I'm not sure why. Some of the songs are good, and it's energetic, but to my taste, it's just inside the edge of 'real Deep Purple' album. Jon Lord at last got a chance to play a little more, but it was too late, and the mix just didn't work as well as it had before. There are some good songs, but I think that for fans, the album is more of a curiosity than a favorite.<br /><br />The front half of the album is much stronger, and more Purple than the second.<br /><br />Key tracks:<br />Comin' Home - fast moving song with a nice piano riff<br />Lady Luck - catchy refrain, nice guitar work<br />I Need Love - Tommy Bolin shows his stuff, and Coverdale indicates what his solo albums will sound like<br /><br />* Where F# is a rating of how much of a fan you need to be to appreciate the album. F1 is an indication that only diehard, compulsive collectors are likely to want the album. F5 indicates that a complete newcomer to the band would appreciate it.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Great animated movie. I've seen it several times & loved it. Seeing it with my kids for the first time, Sid's disfigured toys were a little creepy to them but they still loved the movie. Now they like to pretend their toys come alive when they are not with them.
B0007ZEO4G|4.0|F4*<br />After Who Do We Think We Are, Deep Purple's most famous lineup famously broke down. The core crew was still Jon Lord, Ian Paice, and Ritchie Blackmore. They brought in, on the strength of audition tapes, unknown David Coverdale as singer, and Glenn Hughes on bass and occasional vocals. It's hard to know what they thought Coverdale was missing. His earlier work with The Government was not great, but he turned out to have perhaps the greatest rock voice of all time, whereas Hughes was whiny and nasal.<br /><br />In any event, the new group turned out Burn. It was an astoundingly good album for a band that had lost its famous singer. It also marked a return to the somewhat fantastical lyrics that had existed in Mark I and been almost totally absent in Mark II.<br /><br />Coverdale's voice, even with Hughes' occasional intervention was terrific, and Hughes, while not a good singer, was a powerful bass player, a skill he brought to the forefront here. Blackmore stepped up to the challenge, and turned in some good guitarwork. If it didn't have all the hard rock cords that made Deep Purple famous, it had more melody than it might have.<br /><br />Lost in all this was Jon Lord. Aside from a not very interesting instrumental, \\"A-200\\", he was a background player on the album.<br /><br />Key tracks:<br />Burn - the new Deep Purple arrives in force<br />Sail Away - mystic, moving, and Coverdale's amazing voice<br />What's Goin' On Here - beautiful piano solo, great rhythm<br />Mistreated - Coverdale shows what he can do<br /><br />* Where F# is a rating of how much of a fan you need to be to appreciate the album.

B000PFU7OO|3.0|I bought this for my wife.  She loves it.  It's too \\"girly\\" for me or I would give it 5 stars.
B000002KHB|5.0|F5*<br /><br />Widely held to be Deep Purple's central, classic album, it's true that Machine Head is a tour de force. Less experimental than In Rock, more focused than Fireball, it was hard rock at its best. It had everything: pounding drums, power chords and piercing guitar solos, organ solos, insistent, intriguing bass, screaming but musical vocals. There's not a bad track on it, from the catchy, driving Highway Star to the upbeat Space Truckin'. And, of course, the most famous hard rock song ever - Smoke on the Water.<br /><br />When I was young, Pictures of Home that caught my ear. I told my brother there must be something wrong with the fuzzy, guitar in Smoke on the Water, but it was that same riff that kept me coming back. Over the years, though, it was Lazy that kept my attention. Top rock song of all time, hands down.<br /><br />Key tracks:<br />Highway Star - catchy, rhytmic, driving beat.<br />Pictures of Home - moving, intriguing lyrics<br />Smoke on the Water - THE classic rock song<br />Lazy - best rock song of all time. Moody organ, fantastic guitar, great singing, and it's long<br /><br />* Where F# is a rating of how much of a fan you need to be to appreciate the album.

B001XUIBNO|3.0|It was an old movie and the actors have gained lot more knowledge and experience since it was made..  Was boring...
B000025JJ4|4.0|F4*<br /><br />Thankfully, pretty much everyone agreed that Slaves and Masters wasn't the real Deep Purple, and the band brought Ian Gillan back. A lot of people don't like this album - maybe for the not-very-Purple album cover. But in fact, the music inside is quite good. It veers a little back toward the Perfect Strangers production, which is unfortunate, but the band again presented songs that were interesting to listen to.<br /><br />Blackmore essentially re-did Anya on a later solo album, but it wasn't much better; the song is just not that good, despite a nice intro. But some of the rest are pretty good. Blackmore sticks fairly closely to his Rainbow sound, except on One Man's Meat, but overall the sound is effective.<br /><br />Key tracks:<br />The Battle Rages On - Gillan is back in form.<br />A Time to Kill - melodic rock, good singing<br />Ramshackle Man - the band comes together and does something new and good<br />Nasty Piece of Work - rhythmic and new for Deep Purple<br /><br />* Where F# is a rating of how much of a fan you need to be to appreciate the album. F1 is an indication that only diehard, compulsive collectors are likely to want the album. F5 indicates that a complete newcomer to the band would appreciate it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so fun!!! Lots of interaction, great graphics, and awesome for kids! I love the competition feature!  Highly recommended!
B00000JBFW|3.0|F4*<br /><br />At last, though in fact the break was not that long, what many people considered the 'true' Deep Purple reformed. Apparently, Jon Lord pushed for David Coverdale, but it didn't work out. Still with Ian Gillan, the popular lineup was back, after a variety of solo albums or work with David Coverdale's Whitesnake.<br /><br />They did their best to satisfy, and the songs are decent, but mostly they sound overproduced. Jon Lord comes up to the forefront a bit, but it all sounds a bit generic, somehow. Even in the title track, Perfect Strangers, all the elements elements are there, but it doesn't coalesce somehow. Maybe because the rhythm section sounds like a knockoff of Led Zeppelin's Kashmir - which is sad, because Deep Purple were a much more musical band.<br /><br />Key tracks:<br />Mean Streak - catchy, fun, inventive. If only more it had been like this.<br />A Gypsy's Kiss - again, a fun, fast moving song, with a joke about space truckers thrown in.<br />Wasted sunsets - a great, moving song with terrific guitar work and vocals<br /><br />* Where F# is a rating of how much of a fan you need to be to appreciate the album.

B000001Y9I|3.0|F4*<br /><br />Ritchie Blackmore left Deep Purple for good after the aptly named The Battle Rages On, never to return. In fact, he mostly gave up rock to do medieval-ish pop (surprisingly well). Instead, the band brought in Steve Morse, once of Kansas and the Dixie Dregs.<br /><br />Blackmore's departure was a nasty blow. The one Deep Purple album without him, Come Taste the Band, had been a pretty low point, musically speaking. And his shoes would be hard to fill. To me, though 'the Dixie Dregs' sounded pretty good - not their music, since I didn't know anything about it, but the thought of Dixie and Deep Purple sounded interesting.<br />It wasn't. Purpendicular wasn't a bad album, but it wasn't a great one. I maintain to this day that Steve Morse was and is the wrong man for the job. His playing is just not compelling or melodic in the way the Blackmore's was. Even Tommy Bolin brought more to the task than Morse.<br /><br />To give him credit, Morse didn't try to be Blackmore; he did his own thing. Unfortunately, that thing just isn't very interesting. At the same time, the rest of the band didn't pull up the slack. The lyrics are better than those in House of Blue Light, though the singing tends more towards Gillan's then-recent solo albums. Melodically, it's not clear what the band is doing.<br /><br />There are nonetheless some decent tunes in here while the band is not experimenting. And despite Blackmore's absence it is a Deep Purple Album in the way that Slaves and Masters was not, and Come Taste the Band almost was not. It's just not a great one.<br /><br />Key tracks:<br />Loosen my Strings - melodic and catchy<br />Rosa's Cantina - strong rhythm<br /><br />* Where F# is a rating of how much of a fan you need to be to appreciate the album.

B0095ZQ36G|1.0|I kept reading it, and reading it and reading it, when is the story going to start, and reading and reading, no story yet. Did anyone make it through this book?
0785153942|5.0|I've been looking forward to the Pacific Rim movie for a while now so when i saw this book announced from their FB page I decided to pre-order it.<br /><br />This graphic novel covers the inception and development of the jaeger (a huntsman or marksman in certain units of the German or Austrian armies or a member of a light or mountain infantry unit in some European armies) mechas (human piloted mechanical machine, and not a robot as made very clear by the intro).  It's a good mix of human drama and mechanical information explaining the story of the creation from the concept stage to the prototype stage.<br /><br />The drawing is good and I was happy with the story.  It didn't feel like I was being written to as a child and hand held through the dialog.<br /><br />I'm much more looking forward to the movie after reading this.
B00407PNY2|5.0|Steve McQueen was sexy (as always) and kicked butt in this classic oldie. And of course the classic Mustang was just as cool as McQueen.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|I've been listening to Megadeth since the band formed and was excited when they started making new albums again recently (especially since Metallica has crash and burned leaving a hole for this genre of music).  I enjoy this the most of their most recent albums and find it a wonderful background music to rock to while working or driving.  Nothing overly stood out as a mega block buster hit but on the other hand nothing sucked.  I loved every track equally and enjoyed the entire thing.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love this cd, The combination of violin and dub step is a surprisingly enjoyable mix.I can't wait for her next cd.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|You have to listen to this album at least 5 times before you make a final decision about it.<br /><br />At the first listen you look at the cover and make sure you bought the right thing.<br />At the second listen you ask yourself is this the same Daft Punk I own other albums of.<br />At the third listen you ask yourself who/what/where/when/why.<br />At the fourth listen you call your friends and ask WTF.<br />At the fifth listen you think I'll really listen to it next time and see what I think.<br />At the sixth listen you groove on and enjoy the new Daft Punk sound for what it is.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book had great promise, some very interesting legal issues and kept me awake reading Friday night. The ending just blew it for me..not very credible on multiple accounts. The convenient suicide with little or no scrutiny and my incredulity with the idea of a &#34;killer gene&#34;. I believe people make decisions right or wrong through free will. A heinous murderer's son with a con artist mother could still serve be a good and admirable person.
B008Y768XO|3.0|The movie was wonderful at showing loyalty and the bond of a man and his dog, or maybe a dog and his owner.  The downside was that it was very slow and it was over long before the ending.
B00CLOTNLK|5.0|This gigantic and innovative-sounding album both captures the feeling of progressive rock as we've known it and also stakes out new territory. In some ways it sounds very familiar, and yet it takes you to places you haven't been before. From Zeppelin to Floyd to Yes, Sound of Contact revisit traditional rock n' roll rhythms and sonic landscapes but then accelerate you, seemingly, to outer space and beyond. It's a far-ranging journey that I really enjoyed. \\"Dimensionaut\\" showed me that rock is here to stay. Thanks guys, I'm feeling much better now!

B004I2K4DY|5.0|This production is amazing on all levels.  The highlight of the entire concert, though, is the magnificent voice of Alfie Boe.  If Eddie Redmayne had played Marius it would have been complete perfection.  But this DVD exceeds the film with the sheer talent of Alfie Boe, Samantha Barks, Matt Lucas, and so many others.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I love the sound and lack of a wire (that always seem to get tangled in my chair).  I wish it held a charge longer.

B001N3GUIE|5.0|Got is as a Father's day gift for my 91 Year Old Dad!<br /><br />He loves it, Has not seen the extras yet, but loves the movie and is addicted to it.<br /><br />A really great movie IN COLOR even though it came out in 1956<br /><br />Some of you older people will recognize a lot of the stars, as most of them made memorable movies themselves in later times.<br /><br />This is the debut appearance of Robbie the Robot, that same robot that cause many a young boy to want a robot and was an inspiration to  many wannabe scientists.<br /><br />Way ahead of its time!
145470246X|5.0|I love this book. The instructions are clear, the diagrams are good, and the projects are fun.<br />The only difficulty is that the bead sizes she uses are smaller than the beads readily available in craft stores.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|my little sister loves this app...she misses her horse<br />So this is a great way she can play as y with t h her horse s h e misses
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I'm in love with this movie.  It is so beautiful!  I love how it came with a DVD and digital copy.  You have to see this at least once.
B005DOKM9M|3.0|Dont use it myself, I gave it to my daughter shortly after I bought it as I prefer my nook. I
B0002XNSY0|4.0|I found this movie to be simultaneously funny and disconcerting.  There is a disclaimer at the beginning, but I'm thinking that not all was untrue.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really makes you think. Solve the puzzles and advance. It keeps your mind hopping. Lots of fun and mentally interesting.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I give this book kudos for being different.  I enjoyed the story. It kept me interested and wanting to find out what was going to happen to the characters in the end.
B001NA6096|5.0|This is the closest I've come to finding a movie that portrays the incredible sense of discovery, frailty, and personal risk-taking that occurs when two people meet and fall in love. &#34;Two ships in the night&#34; and you hope they meet again  . . . and dock, side-by-side on the same shore. Loved It!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Completely disappointed. Not only in this as a book, but the fact that it is the final book in the series. It should've been so much more...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Yay.  This is fun.  I like it, except being forced to write a review.  Show you friends and see them smile.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|What a wonderful movie and very touching since it is a true story!! I highly recommend you buy it, you will love i1!
1906735875|5.0|Love these collected stories, and its great seeing the character evolve into what he is today. I highly recommend it.
0307271080|5.0|The book explores the experiences and challenges of a female, Nigerian immigrant student to the U.S. It is well written and highly readable. Her character's &#34;blog posts&#34; are penetrating and insightful. She questions and debunks notions about skin color, liberalism, post-racialism, intellectual pretensions and African immigrant exceptionalism. Highly recommended.
B007R6UYBK|5.0|I did not find these stories to be too coincidental. In fact, I thought the intertwining of themes of lost girls--some who died far too young, and of family betrayals and secrets, and haunting memories to be beautifully done. Jason Issacs is a most attractive actor, a sort of the thinking person's action hero--intelligent, intense and here, a softie with a heart of gold.  The supporting actors were wonderful, particularly the young girl who plays his daughter so believably, as a real kid- so rare among child characters scripted by adults. Additionally, the Scottish locations were lovely and made for a nice change from gritty urban English or American sets. I can hardly wait for series two to come out.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I like this book very much. I have troubles with over analyzing things so I usually read tons of books before starting anything and then it becomes too late when I finish analysis or I become lost in information and give up. Book says: &#34;Read 3 books, no more!&#34;
B00AR83PN4|4.0|I was looking for a mobile version of one of my favorite games, Cubis.  This is not it.  It's a little more challenging than I was looking for...it's not impossible to win the levels, it's not as relaxing as I like.  The yellow and gold blocks are a little too close in color, and in bad lighting, it's easy to confuse them.  Otherwise, it's an ok time waster.
B00CHILW64|5.0|&#34;The Impossible&#34;  is base on a true story and what a story it is.  The acting is very good and the special effects are excellant.  See it, you won't regret it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really like this app.  I have it on my Samsung Galaxy SIII and on my Kindle Fire HD.  Works great on both.  I like that I can customize the sounds, and there are lots to choose from.  Also like the timer; I can set it to shut off the app when the time is up.  I never last beyond the hour I set.  Works wonderfully.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I am a Halo fan. And this movie was amazing well done! It is basically a prequel to the Halo 4 game. But anyways, the acting, story, FX and setting were all brilliant! Especially that we get to see Master Chief in action. It so awesome that i kept getting goosebumps out of excitement during the movie. I highly recommend that every Halo fans out there to buy and watch this movie!
B005LAII80|5.0|Forget Avengers, throw out that Iron Man nonsense, don't fall for the hype of The Dark Knight Rises, Dredd was THE action movie of 2012. Awesome characters, cool story, pumping soundtrack, gritty action, this movie had it all.  Sure it didn't have the slick marketing campaign, but that just proves that this movie is street, the real deal. Check it out. Then tell a friend.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven was a fascinating read.  I highly recommend it to any and everyone.  Worth every penny.  It's not focused on any one religion but just on his experience with heaven.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Like the challenges and the thought processes that go into the puzzles.  I like the wag the puzzles become more challenging.
B00005RDRO|5.0|great movie
159463176X|4.0|I have loved Hosseni's previous books. I did not feel as close to the characters of this book but adored the multiple storyline and enjoyed the tragic updates on current life in Afghanistan. I bought this as a hardcover so I could share it with family and friends as it speaks to many different generations. .
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This is the second Gillian Flynn book I've read and just like the first I was held captive and couldn't put it down.  She us an excellent writer and I recommend it highly!!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Good book and was fun to read awesome title. Rich experience, I'm now passing this book on to my son.
0062124293|5.0|I have sent this book to my sisters and my adult daughter has read and loved it too. Moran has put into words the weird difficulties and great pleasures of being a woman, and is as funny and true as can be.  I just loved it and will reread it just for fun. Don't read while you're eating or drinking, too many laughs to do so in good grace.
0307476073|5.0|This book was so well written detailing the outdoors with great description of the Pacific Crest Trail as well as the underlying inner healing taking place.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|Having heard about the stage production 1000+ times, I pre-ordered this movie version in Blu-Ray to see what it was about. After watching it, my wife and I turned to each other and said \\"okay, but let's never watch this again.\\" Rather than being an uplifting experience, this movie left us depressed. On the plus side, it has stunning visual effects, a big name cast, an easy to understand story, and some fine performances (especially Samantha Barks who played Eponine). On the negative side, most of the big name stars indulge in over-the-top acting with everyone trying to hog as much camera time as humanly possible. All the characters look sick, dirty, and disgusting, which makes it hard to relate--much less sympathize--with them. Finally, and really unforgivable for a musical, the big names stars all sing poorly. Russell Crowe has been beat up enough by others already (and rightfully so). But Hugh Jackman sings like someone is squeezing his neck. And Anne Hathaway would've done better to just say the words to \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" and \\"Fantine's Death.\\" After seeing the movie, I bought the 25th Anniversary Les Miserables In Concert (2010) from Amazon. It has been a night-and-day better experience than this Hollywood movie version. Great singing, great acting (for a concert), great everything!! And fun to watch over and over again. Unless you like feeling beat down after watching a movie, I highly recommend you skip the Hugh Jackman/Richard Crowe/Anne Hathaway version, and buy or rent the 25th Anniversary concert version [[ASIN:B004I2K4E8 Les Miserables: The 25th Anniversary Concert [Blu-ray]]].
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love the challenges. I also love the hunt. if you like 100 Doors or 100 Floors you will love this game.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I was having issues with my phone connecting through my USB  to my computer so I went to the store and they would not help me, just wanted to sell me a new phone, it was just out of warranty, have insurance but said it would not cover it, etc... Told me to just take the card out of it everytime and put the card into my computer. I felt those were all bad solutions. So a guy at work told me about this app and it worked great, it downloads wireless to my drop box account, which I have access to then from my computer and do not have to worry about a hard connecion to my computer again.
B00C7L4QB4|1.0|It has been almost 2 weeks now that I am unable to watch episodes 6, 11 and 12. I haven't checked episode 13, what would be the point until I see the others?? *****This is extremely frustrating.***** Although the folks at Amazon have been adequately obliging on the phone, it does not change the fact that they have been unable to fulfill on their end. I am an excellent customer and purchase a great deal through the site. I am waiting to see what is done if anything other than refunding the purchase prices for the unavailable episodes. (How about refunding me the price of the entire series since I am unable to enjoy it in its entirety??)
B003H6KRIE|5.0|If you like the Bourne movies this is a good deal to get the 3 originals.  Very nice in bluray.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i read all the books in Percy Jakson I love the adventures they had and im ready to read the next book called the heros of olympus so i recomened you to read them ''<br />  u<br />&#60; :)the best series
B004WR125O|5.0|I prefer the network adapter to be built in but at least this one isn't priced outrageous like some manufacturers do.  The setup is as easy as a Playstation and it has not failed yet.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|While at Disney my kiddos decided we needed to add to our DISNEY DVD Collection. After going to the Beast's castle and Belle's Enchanted Tales, we decided to update our old VHS copy of this movie. It also had a new song in it.  With our Amazon Prime shipping, it almost beat us home!
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|If you are looking for a movie that does not make you think, then don't watch this movie---you have to work for it. It has many issues (human rights, relationships, war, corporate greed, religious ideas, etc.) and it plays out over various time frames (past, present, and future) with actors playing multiple roles in the same movie.<br />Again, if you are looking for a teen slash horror, zombie apocalypse, explosions and car chases---look elsewhere, but if you have patience and let yourself go, the reward is in the journey and reflection.
B00168OIOE|5.0|We love Monsters, Inc and were looking to upgrade our old VHS Cop while at Disney. I ordered three Disney movies using my smartphone. It is great to have the DVD for the car, Blue-ray for home, and the digital copy for on the go! With our Amazon Prime shipping, it almost beat us home!
0425263991|5.0|Definitely the best book in the series after Slave to Sensation(Book 1).Was not expecting this because the last couple books in the series were kind of a letdown (especially Sierra and Hawke's book).But this...this is amazing!!!!and I love me some Kaleb..
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging game, I look forward to more rooms and harder puzzles. Great blend between numbers, items, colors, and balance. Great job!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I'm so glad QOTSA came out with a new one.  This album will not disappoint.  You can put it on and listen start to finish... then start it all over and do it again and again and again.  I love it!
B000002GAF|5.0|This album changed my life and was instrumental (pun intended) in my becoming a professional musician.  Simply flawless, one of my top 5 albums, of all time.  Nuff said!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|its awesome its fast paced and exciting I love it grafics are good for this device and the game play and controls are smart
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved playing this game, kept me amused for hours! Can't wait for more levels! Something to really get your teeth into!
B00005ATZT|5.0|this move is a good action move. I like action movies and have a lot so this movie will go perfect in my collection. Thanks &#34;L&#34;

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|We like this movie because of the fighting. I have many movie that this movie with go good in my collections.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A journey to a dark and foreign place, a tale about a nation of broken puppets and equally damaged puppetmasters. A story that is as thrilling as it is chilling.<br />Heinrich
B00914JWSW|5.0|A great collection of songs and music.  Barbra has the timing and skill to carry off these pieces and the voice to make the difference.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|I have watched this over and over on cable and decided I needed my own copy.  Great story and who doesn't love John Krasinski?
B007SGM084|4.0|Far be it from me to say I wasn't excited, titillated or aroused.  It was a well crafted story that I feel, got stretched into a trilogy.  The characters were fully realized and quite three dimensional.  And their seductive personalities had me falling in love with Ana and Christian the more I got into the narrative.  It is my opinion that this could have easily been contained in two books.<br /><br />After a while, as compelling as the sex scenes were they digressed into padding between the scenes that carried the plot.<br /><br />When all is said and done I couldn't put the books down.
1781162646|3.0|The cover of this \\"Hard Case Crime Novel\\" is a con, but that's okay. Because it's about an amusement park and the carnies, so a con is not out of place. Though it looks like a hard boiled thriller by Donald Westlake (who the book is dedicated to), it is really much closer to the film \\"Adventureland\\" with Jesse Eisenberg than Mickey Spillane. It's mainly a coming of age novel with a touch of crime and the supernatural. But it's a fun read. (There is, toward the end of the book, a political cheap shop which seems to wish the death of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Since the writing of this book, the former image of the former vice president looks better and better. Any surveillance he authorized was to keep the country safe, unlike the current administration which seems to do so to get even with political enemies and cover their own behinds. Why even bring politics into a silly little carny thriller?)
B000UOGHKS|5.0|I love how the critics bashed this album, but now consider this one of the best albums she made and a must have to own ! You will see the same with American life ten years from now . Every Madonna fan and non Madonna fan can<br />Enjoy this album . Pure art , anybody who doesn't get it , I really feel bad for them .
B00CHILW64|5.0|This movie was edge-of-the-seat tense for me. I did bite my nails off. I cried and cheered and hugged myself when the family found each other. I hope they are doing fine. It was a well made film and adaptation of a true story I thought. It made me want to find out more about it. The actors even acted like they were concerned and meshed into the real life people that his happened to. This was almost like a documentary but one step better in that it made you feel as if you were right there with them.
3464208516|4.0|I find it very easy to work with and not boring! I suggest this item to everyone who wants to learn the German Language and don´t have the time to or don´t have anyone to practise with.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I only just got this but so far its fun. has enough different actions to keep it interesting. I'm looking forward to the jobs being iver to see what else will come up.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|All the movies were included in one inexpensive slim dvd book. Great movie series. Recommend this to anyone. Must see.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Great show, very addicting. Great plot!! Suspenseful in every way. Definitely worth watching. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good show to watch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was very fun and cool it makes you that an finger out stuff  and there's codes and so many rooms
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great free time fun game. Enjoy all the puzzles. It's fun for all ages. Keep up the great work.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Umm well it's a dictionary what can I say more.  It Haas a lot of good words that shall be defined
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|One of my absolute favorite books, by far. The ultimate love story that pulled at my heart and left me turning page after page. Wonderful!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|FUN. I like how the graphics are so colorful and clear. It would be better if the driving things were b
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I am a Avid fan of Cirque Du Solei; and let me tell you, I got this at walmart for $5.00!!! on Dvd, I was skeptical at first, and then I was like What do I have to lose, If I don't enjoy the show...Nothing. So I went ahead and bought it. Wow!!! It was awesome!!!! The whole show, the ending was the best part though. Get ittt!! Great visuals, and no to mention the music on surround sound! The Beatles. It's a definate must see!!!  Great Show to watch with Family and Friends.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|Josh Groban's voice is wonderful, but the selection of tunes on the CD provide him little opportunity to exercise it. Most lack dynamics, sounding closer to narration than music. All lack lyricism or emotional expression. Very disappointing overall.
B000022TSY|5.0|I ordered this with a bit of caution because of the age of the product. I should not have worried, it was as advertised in \\"New\\" condition still shrink wrapped. It arrived in the time promised and I was very pleased with that as well.<br />This is a classic cult film and anyone who enjoys indie films should watch this it includes several different film types thanks to Dennis Hopper's direction. It is really a film to be experienced and not just watched.
B00AW57L96|4.0|Great fun read, enjoyed the characters and ethical dilemmas.  Not sure the prologue was the best way to finish the book, but interesting in a 'sliding doors' kind of way..
B005PK56TA|5.0|I like paranormal, though I don't like extreme horror shows , American Horror Story takes you to the edge with its twists and turns and doesn't cross the line.  It doesn't fail to deliver the thrills and suspense.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|It's fun and a good way to almost mindlessly enjoy a break.  Adds a new dimension to mahjong type games.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Had fun with my eight year old son playing this! Bummed when we got through all levels so soon. Challenging  but not impossible.
0740748475|5.0|I realize there are people who buy these books as investments and may be disappointed that they're not bound in gold and kevlar, but I got them so I could rifle through them anytime I pleased.  A terrific collection, and it was nice to pass along my enormous stack of paperbacks to others.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|What a great game.hours of fun and enjoyment.would definitely recommend this game for both young and old.best game I've played on my kindle fire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this app is awesome and that they basset minion rush off this I think they should make a world/place basses on minion rush.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game has very good graphics and you have to use your brain Toto get through all the levels definitely 5 stars
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Such a great show! If you enjoyed fairy tales as a child, you will love this show! Very cleverly entertained stories and lives of fairy tale characters. New take on old classics!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Loved this book! Couldn't put it down! I read it in one day, with a few breaks here and there.
B008XCM18Q|4.0|Short and to the point on this review, it was a good book, got a little bored in parts of what a bush or tree looked like or a street, like who cares, but on the core of the book is worth readying...GAB
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome. At first I was like um but then I saw that the average review was 4 1/2 stars and 7,844 people had downloaded this game.  When you play it there is obstacles.  Really cool.  You should get it because it is an awesome app. Just amazing.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|These legends took the story were it was left and gave it a solid and consistent continue to their legacy, after so many years they showed that they still have an unique and remarkable way of feeling the music.Their legacy seems that will continue till supersonic years with their damaged souls going on and on...
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book is by far one of the best I've ever read. By the end I felt like I was in the story. Sitting there as everything changed. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|best game ever I got it and played the whole free game of it and imedietly bought the full one.... it is not a waist at all get get get sooooo much fun you will be garaunteed to love it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is really good, it doesn't freeze or anything. Just a simple useful caculater. Plus it has alot of stuff, not just addition and subtraction, works as promised. I would recommend this app!
0761158820|5.0|For the price of this book, it can provide hours of creative entertainment, as well as get the gears turning on how you can create your own. Similar paper crafts are beginning to catch on, but this book is a fun and affordable introduction to paper models, and much easier than just printing out models online to assemble yourself, given that the models are on heavier paperstock and precut and scored to make things that much more straightforward. It's not just for kids either, as they would make fantastic desk decorations in an otherwise drab office.
0143120530|5.0|Extremely well- written and interesting.<br /><br />This is not a book on how to help your rusting memory, but rather a book for people who want or need to memorize things. (Attention school kids!) it's also a fascinating read on the history of memorization.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Its interesting, hold you breath, and a must, to finish out the trilogy. Wish there was a 4th. You wont be disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I Love this series. I only wish all episodes were free, so will continue to wait until they are. Thanks for the glimpse.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Like the first part of game. Challenging. Need to have tab for hints on how to find objects if needed. Found what I thought was all in level 3, but key not showing up. Not user friendly
B00475AYJQ|5.0|If you like fantasy and are sick of cliche plots, you will love this book. The first book is just as good!
0739384198|5.0|I thought the writer did a magnificent job.  I could hardly turn the audio book off.  I have listened to the two previous books of the trilogy.
1451673442|5.0|This 28 day step by step guide to manifesting your hearts desire is a very interesting read for people of all ages. fast shipping and a great price.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Omg this is just like 50 Shades but better and you wont be disappointed I loved these series cant wait for the next book
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Something for everyone. The entire family enjoyed watching this delightful video. It's fun, funny and well written. Try it, you'll enjoy it too.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Received product when promised and it's in great shape.  Never been opened so I'm going to assume that means the movies will play just fine.  Just ordered Season 1 and can't wait for Season 3 to be released.
B0063IH60K|2.0|This was a little disappointing as it ihas none of the extras that My Windows games have.  I would recommend not buying it.
B00821OX98|5.0|Another great show to watch. Can't wait for season three to come out on Amazon prime. Hopefully there are many more seasons to follow.
0440237688|5.0|I enjoyed reading The Giver because it told a story of a world that became \\"perfect\\" a creation of mind I guess you could say. But that all came to an end quite after the story progresses to where the main character can't accept the choices that the community that he had once lived in and eventually ran away... He ran not just anywhere, he had run back into that area that has the same imperfect society that we live in today.<br /><br />I was very thankful when I have had been recommended this book I was kind of shocked if you think about. I was shocked in many ways hearing that I should read The Giver because I heard that this book had such great reviews but even then so for me not liking many books that have been written out and about in the world I enjoyed it.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I was very suprised when I watched this that it held my attention and was interesting. I find most movies of future ugliness absurd, not this one. Give it 4.5 stars if possible.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Another good CD with the music from the great show Nashville.  The artists singing the songs should have their own CDs
B001NHNG64|4.0|Very good read.lots of action,surprises too. Moves right along. If action is your thing you will enjoy this book.Jack Reacher,No2.
B00005R24K|3.0|For those coming unenlightened by previous experience with this film in its three decades of existence, expect nothing but variations on how to create horror with disgust. No doubt it has retained the power to do so successfully even to this day---at least if you are not in a setting where communal unease creates defensive laughter and mockery. You have to decide for yourself before watching. No doubt it is good horror but is it a good (as opposed to financially successful) movie. My opinion is not of any use on the subject; I would simply advise that this is a film best watched with a group of people. You will not emerge from it, unless, as I say, you attack its impact, feeling Good.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Alright movie. Felt it was heavily geared towards children. Very childish at times. Was probably a good movie if viewed in 3D.
B004SIP9P6|4.0|Certainly, despite the multiple murders, this is an almost benign entry in the Scream Franchise. I don't feel a need to compare it to the other two, this being the third in the series, but it does has a lighter tone and sticks to the point better. Still there is a sufficiency of screams (by the cast), ambiguities and warmth to satisfy the average viewer for the somewhat reduced level of real horror. The two lead female parts continue to be neatly handled by two actresses ( Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox), very different in type but attractive and talented. One of the female newcomers also puts in a good performance. It is a far cry from the best of Hitchcock but  I commend it to the audience which has seen the other two as well as those who have not. The latter will soon catch on to enough of the previous stories to enjoy this one.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works great.  Replaced a cable that had cracked and no longer worked.  Very pleased.  Would order it again.  Thank you
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As wonderfully written as his first two novels were, this one stands out as even richer in themes and descriptive language. He absolutely brings his characters and their circumstances alive. This writer's books should be required reading for every secondary school student in America.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is extremely popular here in Santa Fe, Nm. I think people want to retrurn to a more simple time where society is structured, workers are valued for life, there is more social stability and people look out for one another more than the govt. Things werent perfect but perhaps better back in the early 20th century.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|It kept me very interested, I thought the layout of the story line very unusual. The actual descriptions and use of words was very good. It was easy to visualise the place where the story took part. Just a great read and as good as Hosseines other books.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|love it a lot. if u like halo wars or any game like that get this game now. thanks amazon and gameloft
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|As I wanted to see a movie with my parents. I going through the releases of 2011-2013 and Gangster Squad caught my attention with the actor selection. Was going in knowing nothing about the plot or the quality of the movie, other than 3.5 star rating on Amazon and a few of previews long time ago.<br /><br />Movie made me think of Watchman meets Boardwalk empire TV-series. Fast action movie that moves along at a pretty moderate rate, never wasting on screen time or filling in. Both the plot and cinimatography is great, it keeps you guessing, makes you worry about the actors and has a really strong ending.<br /><br />Would recommend to any person that loves the Gangster theme and good movies.
B00C061I3K|1.0|Total Garbage, who listens to this crap. this sounds like someone is caught in a video game, the crap that passes for music these days is sad. i wouldn't even give this a half a star if i could.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Great series with Tom Selleck.  Always enjoy his acting and the stories are always good.  This was a good buy.

0671510991|5.0|This book covers the last 300 years of history, emphasizing every small detail that has influenced the outcome of every event of the history of the world. This is a great 30 min guide to everything you need to know about the decisions made by the major world leaders. The book answers every question you may possible have uncovering the intricate world beyond the speeches.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|stereotypical peasant boy gets into elite knight training, gets bullied a lot, befriends a young royal, in position to save the world over the course of a series.  nothing new or ingenious, but enough for a good author to work with.  sadly, this isn't written by a good author.  very ... shallow, the \\"deep plots\\" are very transparent.  magic is only in evidence as old constructs, a sword, a bridge, a barrier, that no one can replicate anymore.  a mysterious wizard/kings adviser is really the only magic you actually see wielded by a person other than the main character, and both characters only use magic a few times in the whole book.  lack of imaginative descriptions, little in the way of actual action, almost no magical activity.
B0060MYK7G|4.0|Excelent !<br /><br />I would recomend it 100 % the historic content is amaizing.<br />It prompts me to revise the historic validity. But so far is a good pros=duct.

B005WUHAX8|4.0|While I am happy with the case, I am angered to learn that a buyer qualifies for the \\"Total Water Protection Program\\" ONLY if purchased from either Verizon or directly through LifeProof.  I wish this had been made clear at the time of my purchase from Amazon, especially since the Amazon price is the same as Verizon or LifeProof.  No discount and no Total Water Protection.  The only thing I now have is a 1 year manufacturers warranty on the case.  What a bust.
B008NW67E0|4.0|Following up a record like Sigh No More would be a difficult task for any group and certainly Mumford & Sons knew this. Do you play it safe and stick with what made you popular or do you shake things up and risk losing the tide of support you've gained? That's never an easy question to answer and every artist must make that decision for themselves. In the case of Babel the answer is simple: don't stray too far from the formula but find a way to keep it interesting. The payoff is, for the most part, satisfying.<br /><br />The record bursts out of the gate with great strength. The album's title track is forceful and engaging, followed by the catchy \\"Whispers in the Dark\\" and the popular hit \\"I Will Wait\\". \\"Holland Road\\" continues in the same fashion, giving us the trademark melodies and poetic lyrics we've come to expect from the group. Everything that made their first release so surprising is still here, even if it doesn't sound quite as fresh as it did the first time around. It's hard to fault the band for continuing their unique sound, yet it does feel a bit less exciting, mainly with the middle half of the record. Songs like \\"Lovers' Eyes\\", \\"Ghosts That We Knew\\", and \\"Reminder\\" are not in and of themselves bad songs. Rather, they simply cause the middle part of the album to drag in too many ballads. A slightly different running order would have helped the pacing a bit more. The ending run of \\"Broken Crown\\", \\"Below My Feet\\", and \\"Not With Haste\\" end the album with a bang and they bring the record to a wonderful conclusion.<br /><br />Babel is a solid effort and its many accolades are well-earned. I find the tracks in the middle to be a bit too slow in the running order, though they are enjoyable when taken individually. M&S have a winning formula but it's also one that will eventually need to expand and grow in order to keep them from sounding too routine. This group is talented and I look forward to seeing where they carry themselves from here. I have faith that they can do it.hey can do it.

1932100660|5.0|It's simple - just eat a whole foods, plant-based diet - no meat, dairy, fish, eggs, or oils....it's the healthiest diet on the planet. There is no other conclusion an open-minded, data / research minded person can reach. The research is all there for anyone who has any doubt at all about what diet to follow to lose weight and have a long and healthy life. I am 72 and healthy and plan to live to a healthy 100. This book is the key to getting there.

I certainly will listen to it often as each time that I listen my soul awakens.Ive been enlightened .Get the book ...I purchased it from audible so that I can listen on the go.I must add that answers to some of life most mind boggling troubles are answered in this book.
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|First of all, the quality of this DVD is excellent, and in particular, the audio is amazingly good. I was able to crank this up and experience the high energy, driving power of these true metal gods. All the song selections were excellent (they range across all of Judas Priest's albums), but there was a section in the middle with Metal Gods, Prophecy, and Nightcrawler were I knew I was watching the best metal performers on the planet. Rob Halford, although advancing in years, is still able to belt out the songs. His stage presence is absolutely sinister. He is a true legend. The new guitarist, Richie Faulkner is very good as well. He would have fit right into that golden age of heavy metal era from the late 70's to early 80's. And as an aside, wouldn't it be awesome if the teenagers of today were blaring the music of heavy metal out their car speakers instead of that insipid and lame rap music we hear? The young men of today have been so emasculated and they don't even know it. Anyway, this DVD is awesome. The only drawback is that the London crowd only seemed half into it at times. But Priest were at their best and I loved it.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is classic Monty Python. Medieval King Arthur in search of the Holy Grail which is guarded by a vicious killer small white bunny rabbit.

B0086213XW|4.0|Not fun to watch, but brought up a good point. I really hated the personality of the female character.  She drove me nuts.  But, like I said, made a really good point.  Was going through a break up, and gave me some things to think about.  After this movie, decide NOT to try to get in another relationship. Enough is enough, nothing is perfect... much settling ensues... no thanks.
193700788X|2.0|I've been reading the Sookie books since the very beginning of the series. It was actually one of my first vampire series (now there seems to be dozens of them.) I've loved this series and it will always hold a special place in my heart. This being said this book was a severe disappointment for me.<br /><br />First of all it seemed extremely rushed and short for a book that's concluding a major and popular series. There were a a lot of characters and story lines to wrap up, and I feel she realized this too late.  the things that all the fans care about the most are almost never addressed and the trivial things, like what happened to characters were haven't seen in 5 books, are talked about at length. The worst thing for me though, was how characters that we have known and loved for 13 books now are hardly even in the book! I mean, come on, this was the finale! I get you have your own plan and vision for the plot but you can't just ignore very popular and prominent characters.<br /><br />Sookie annoyed me in this book. Usually I found her charming and kind of spunky, but here I thought she was being stubborn and unreasonable.  Regardless of who she ended up with (which also made me VERY unhappy), I felt she was out of character for most of her choices in this book. Also, it is the southern VAMPIRE series, isnt it? well where the heck were all the vampires?! Honestly it all seemed rushed and unrealistic knowing all the previous information.<br /><br />Basically, I was just disappointed. None of my favorite characters were really featured, the plot was a little weak, and the book just felt different and made me angry.  (Again most of this is not related to who she ends up with, I'm not just a disappointed fangirl). I don't think readers are supposed to go away from a series feeling that way. A little sad it's over yes, but not angry or disappointed.<br /><br />I'm just glad other reviewers seem to agree with me! I'm really sad I won't be seeing any more Sookie books, but seeing this direction I'm a little relieved its over. I'm just going to make up my own ending...ut seeing this direction I'm a little relieved its over. I'm just going to make up my own ending...
B005BGBPBG|2.0|I couldn't believe the plot.  In my book, if someone treats their significant other badly... it probably means they'll eventually do the same thing to you if you become their sig other.  I don't see the appeal of what plays out here, in my mind, the dude she winds up with is a dog.
B004VN39YG|5.0|I have been wanting this movie for quite some time.  I really enjoy the music on this movie and I found myself humming the songs all the time!  It's a good story of why someone who needs rest and therapy should be allowed to continue therapy until doctors say they are ready to leave.  On this movie the one spouse is too pushy and the results are not good.<br />This movie has wonderful music and shows people having a good time while being &#34;on the road.&#34;  I highly recommend this movie.  It's great entertainment.<br /><br />We were very pleased with the handling and the short time it took to get the movie in the mail.  Amazon does such a fantastic job!

B009XIXVU6|3.0|I absolutely loved A thousand Splended suns and Kite Runner, however, this one was a little different for me.

B008JFUPK8|1.0|What a strange time for Hollywood of late, wherein history is turned into comic book and comic book is turned into history: thus we have Lincoln as a vampire hunter and the new Superman as leaden and lugubrious as so much history is made out to be.  Superman was born, not on Krypton, but in the pages of a comic book - yet this new take has naught of comic book charm, color, character or charisma.  One four minute Fleischer cartoon from the forties has more excitement and enchantment than this entire two and a half hour cinematic computer game.  Any one of those seventeen animated masterpieces is more artistic, better scripted, better scored, better acted and better directed than the whole of this CGI dominated disaster.<br /><br />This movie is like a baked potato overloaded with cheese, bacon bits, chives, more cheese, onions, some more bacon bits, loads of sour cream, a bit more bacon bits, another glob of sour cream....so overloaded in fact that the taste of the baked potato is completely lost!  All that is left of the meal is...overload! Which is to say that special effects submerge whatever story there is herein.  And that is a pity, because Henry Cavill is a super-looking Superman.  But he says next to nothing.  His dialogue could fit on one page.  General Zod and Jor-El seem to never zip it.  Yet the Man of Steel, well, I guess he is the literal strong and silent type.  But...it is a silence that squanders. And so much is squandered here and totally enslaved by...special effects.  How many explosions can one watch?  How many toppling buildings must one endure?  How many totally unbelievable alien landscapes must one navigate?  How many Superhero fisticuffs that seem more like WrestleManias on super-steroids can one watch?  How many cars and buses and planes spinning out of control and crashing all over Creation must there be?  When does the audience ever say 'Enough'?  When will the film-makers ever use some directorial discretion and say 'Cut'?  When will stories matter more again than special effects???<br /><br />But this is no longer a matter of taste.  Not really.  It is a matter of unasked for addiction.  A twig grows the way it is bent.  Recent generations have known little else.  For one, speed is essential in this technologically dominated time leading to rapidity of movement and thought and deed. No seeming time to smell the roses anymore. And it seems the daily diet of our days anymore is...disaster. All disasters, man-made and acts of God, are in our backyards anymore thanks to our technological tools. Last but nowhere near least are the unimaginable horrors of the forever caught-on-film, cinematic-seeming exploding, collapsing Twin Towers and the nightmares of future ones that have impacted EVERYTHING: mind, mortality, morality...and movies.  Our movies, our entertainments are now packed with even worse visions of total immolation seemingly to subconsciously prepare our precarious world for tomorrow's cataclysms - and also to act as a catharsis to what has already been lived and witnessed and forever seared into our collective conscious, the sub as well.  In the movies, no matter how many skyscrapers collapse and bombs go off, there will be the hero to set things right.  \\"It was like a movie\\" say so many when interviewed after whatever disaster has been witnessed.  So it would seem then that many (if not most) movies are not simply about entertainment any longer - but moreso on an unspecified, unstated mission to inoculate us all against the coming Armageddon, the next Holocaust.  Yet movies of the sort I am speaking of do not simply assist viewers in dealing with the chaos and calamity of Life.  Addiction leads, alas, too often to actualization. 3-D is an attempt to actualize - but it falls short.  Almost being able to reach out and touch the 3-D CGI bomb is close...but no cigar.  And that is but one of the dangers inherent in a majority of the action-addictive movies of today.<br /><br />We are all addictive personalities in a world that passes away faster and faster, that is much more disposable anymore than enduring. Perhaps the only way to end an addiction is to introduce a new one. Our humanity is truly being lost to the technologic. So a movie such as MAN OF STEEL could and should have used much more story, more character development, more humanity, more humor, more fun, more delight, more awe and, yes, more love - and way less CGI action by far!  Alas, as it is, it merely feeds the addiction for mind-numbing, sense-deadening, emotionless, brainless action.  Action at all costs. ALL costs. So despite its having ten minutes of value, this is not a movie.  It is madness.ive personalities in a world that passes away faster and faster, that is much more disposable anymore than enduring.

B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I really enjoy movies from this time period.  Even though these movies are full of blood and gore, I still like them as they are true to their time in history. I do find it ironic that even back in those days, politics were around and is still thriving today.  There is still blood and gore going on today, but perhaps it is a little more subdued, but there are plenty of people having their lives taken from them in many foreign countries on a daily basis.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|The acting, the casting, the production and the music in this movie are superb. the story line is a little jagged just like a low budget western should be. The action is gory and there is some skin shown in the process. I loved the movie for its frank portrayal of the atrocities people can commit against each other under the guise of power and ignorance.
B00003CX9W|5.0|I grew up watching this movie on VHS and was heartbroken when the VHS started deteriorating.  This is my favorite movie (even as an adult) and when I found this DVD on Amazon I was overjoyed!  I've owned this for several years now and have watched it many times.  The quality is excellent and I enjoy the addition of the original introduction sequences (my VHS didn't have them).  I have used clips from this DVD several times in my music classroom and my students have enjoyed it as well.

B00CJKW4WQ|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3UVRBXW9J0KE7]]The Satechi Bluetooth Wireless keyboard is very handy. It hooks up wirelessly, so it doesn't take up valuable USB space, and it can then be conveniently placed wherever you need it.<br /><br />It's easy to connect - just go into your Bluetooth preferences, turn this on, and press the connect button on the back with a paperclip or something like that. You'll see it listed on your Bluetooth preferences as \\"Bluetooth Calculator Keypad\\" and then after you opt to link it to your device, it will ask you to type in a few numbers on the keypad and press enter. Voila! - it connects. After that, you just have to turn it on and your system should recognize it.<br /><br />I use it with my Macbook Pro, where it comes in especially handy when I'm inputting grades in Excel. In keypad mode, anything you type will go on the screen. So if you type \\"3*5\\" it will type \\"3*5\\" in whatever editor you have open. In calculator mode, you can actually do the calculation: type \\"3*5\\" and it will give you \\"15\\" but then you can \\"push\\" that result to the editor you have open by pressing the \\"Send\\" button. I perform most of my calculations in Excel spreadsheets themselves, but this comes in handy when I have to do some quick arithmetic before I input anything.<br /><br />It looks nice - a handsome little device that goes well with my Mac. It takes 2 AAA batteries. It's set up to work with both Macs and PCs - there's a switch on the bottom that allows you to select which system you'll be working with. My only (minor) gripe is that the \\"on/off\\" switch is down below. It does turn off automatically when not in use after a few minutes - but whenever I need to use it again, I have to pick it up, turn it over and turn it on. Not a big deal, but it would have been much easier to have an on/off button on top.<br /><br />About the video: it's very quick, just to give you a sense of what it looks like and how it works. It's a bit blurry - I shot it using an old Flip Video camcorder that I had sitting around. Still, I hope that it is helpful.

B0054TVW04|2.0|The book started with a bang and finished with a fizzle.  The historical points of reference could have been summarized in much fewer paragraphs.  It became tedious at many points when it seemed that he provided way too much detail to make a point.  I often found myself having to push through sections of unnecessary detail that did not add to the substantive point of the conversation.  I read 2-3 books a month, and this was one of the more difficult reads of this year.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|A beautiful book, which was extremely well written.<br />I loved this tale, and the characters in the story.<br /><br />I had given up on Kate Morton after &#34;The Shifting Fog&#34;, which was a big let down after &#34;The Forgotten Garden&#34;, but was told to give her another chance. I'm glad I did.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game. Basically hidden object game, but the objectives make it more fun. Would recommend to other who like hidden object games.

B00AG6Z92C|2.0|Wow what a disappointment, nothing like his previous music, there was only one song I like in the entire CD, I find that his music is becoming more and more commercialized, his voice is great, the music arrangements not that good, the songs uffaaaaaaa, I really did not like this CD...it is a shame, because he is great, but he has become so commercialized that it is a shame

B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is fun some levels hard but when I figure it out I think dang I shoulda known that. keep coming with the levels please it helps time go by
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game . It's challenging and fun. It makes me think. I find myself running back in between chores to play one more game.
0545265355|4.0|I have these on a Nook, but still prefer &#34;paper media&#34; for stuff I know I will want to reread at some point. I started rereading Book 2 in anticipation of the second movie coming in November. This is a super trilogy. One I enjoyed reading almost as well as Stieg Larsson's Millenium trilogy.
B001KN6C9E|5.0|This is one of those books, that once you start reading it, you don't want to put it down.  It gives you much empathy for the Chinese people.<br />We hear so much about Hitler and \\"The Holocaust\\".  Why don't we hear more about the Japanese atrocities of World War II?
B002IXA5KW|1.0|What else can I say? Take your money elsewhere? I really want my money back to be honest. Stupid doesn't describe it. Waste of time doesn't even come close. The ending can be described as like being thrown through a plate glass window. It really is an experience you can skip and I advise you to do just that!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have been waiting and looking forward to this book. Sylvia doesn't disappoint with the chemistry and sex scenes. However, I did not like the ending. I'm glad Gideon and Eva's story will continue but there could've been a better ending. I can't wait to read the next book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoyed Wool because of the descriptive writing style which in my opinion would have been held back had this book been written and published through traditional channels. It's about what the readers want, not just a reader, right? The journey through each story isn't meant to answer every question or fill in every imaginative detail; the thorough writing forces YOU to walk those steps, put on that suit and gasp for air. I laugh at the critics that say Wool is simplistic, if so why didn't they write it? Entertaining story, worth the time and money I can't wait to see what's next.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is challenging as you progress through the levels. It's my goal to get 3 stars on each one.
0738737909|4.0|This is a beautiful, jewel of a deck, although I find it too busy for the style of reading that I prefer.

B001DPHDCY|5.0|My nieces and nephews love getting movies, and this one was no exception.  It's a really cute movie that adults and kids can enjoy together.  It's funny as well.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book is written as an oral retelling of the history of the zombie war. It's a very different writing style than I'm used to, but worked perfectly for this type of story, making it unique and interesting. The book starts being told 12 years after the continental U.S. celebrated its victory, so you know how the story ends when it begins. The Chapters are laid out as 'Warnings', 'Blame', 'The Great Panic', 'Turning the Tide', 'Home Front USA', 'Around the World and Above', 'Total War', and 'Good-Bye'. Each Chapter has separate sections that are interviews with different survivors that have something to do with the Chapter's title.<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />What I liked most about this book is that it is very easy to read. You have these sections in the Chapters so you can read the full Chapters at a time if you'd like or you can easily stop after reading just one small section that's just a few pages long. The way the story is written is so unique because it's all done as a historically accurate view of a war that's happened. Interviews done with Generals, doctors, the Vice President, etc. from all parts of the world that show different viewpoints of what was happening in each field and in each country during the phases of the war.<br /><br />It was so fascinating getting to learn about patient zero that started it all, the warning signs that were ignored, and the first encounters with something they never thought could exist. The different countries that were examined and the political aspects of everything that happened was incredibly realistic and well-researched. The book is so thought-provoking, making me often wonder what I would do in each of these survivor's situations. I'll tell you now that if zombies ever attack, it will be a terrifying thing. The fact that this enemy doesn't have to eat, breathe, or sleep even when your army has to, is a bad place to be in. Throw in the fact that when they take one of your soldiers, they are increasing their own ranks, then it becomes a spectacularly scary enemy to face. On top of the zombies they were up against, they also had to combat humans going crazy and acting like zombies (called quislings), children raised in the wild with no parents (called ferals), wild animals, rebels, and people called LaMOES that did anything they could to survive including shooting down anyone that came close, no matter if they were friendlies or the living dead.<br /><br />Then I got to learn about the battle strategies, the zombies taking over the waters because they didn't have to breathe, and overall final skirmishes that ended the war. There was one really intriguing section all about how the army used dogs to help them win. They trained mutts to be scouts and decoys. Things like this were just really interesting to think about.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />You do already know the outcome of the story when it starts. While this wasn't necessarily a bad thing in my opinion because I was invested in finding out what all happened, it could turn some readers off.<br /><br />Some of the sections were by far more entertaining than others. I'll admit to skimming through a few that just weren't that important to me in terms of the outcome of the war or adding new information for what was happening in their world.<br /><br />The Romance<br /><br />Yeah, there's no romance in this book, though there is a section about \\"the greatest weapon a Russian woman can wield is her uterus.\\" It was about rebuilding the population of the world now that the war was over. So, ummm, that was a little odd.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I was taken aback by how much I liked this book. I don't usually enjoy historical books in general and this is my first zombie book, so I'll admit to not expecting a lot out of it. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of information it held about a world racked by war, and the amazing accounts of survivors that included not just fights, but all aspects of how a world is affected, from the end of DVD players and whales to the population being united in a single shared experience. If you like zombies at all or reading a thought-provoking novel, then this is one you sure don't want to miss.ted, from the end of DVD players and whales to the population being united in a single shared experience.

0767836286|2.0|Spoiler alert! Sorry! Just would not go down like that in the real world. Coulda easily been stopped when the fbi guy asked him what was going on after they kidnapped his son. Any body in there right mind woulda said they kidnapped my son & they woulda been all over that dude(tim robins character) like stink on s*** & realized he was up to something big. & how did they know he was gonna drive into the parking lot. Impossible! No way in hell they would gamble a big move like that on a split decision, emotional reaction! Doesn't make sense! He could've easily punked out & stayed outside, where only about 4 people woulda got killed, with minimal damage to the building.

B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Just a way to sell you add-ons. I suppose it could be considered cute, (Ben the dog is better)<br />But it is a thinly disguised vending machine for in-app purchases.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|They put a lot of effort into trying to make 1 book into 3 movies, that it seems nobody had the heart to edit anything out. The first hour of the movie just dragged on and on.  Perhaps the second and third hours are much more entertaining and action packed, but I have to say... I didn't get to them.  After the first hour, I couldn't go on.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This satisfies my desire to play a little of SOMETHING.<br />The lighted keys that flash for the next note are very cool, producing satisfying results quickly.<br />Still a toy, it makes you sound great,

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey's book is a great read.  It's hilarious, charming, witty, and endearing. I have to admit, I'm not a fan of her show, 30 Rock, but I like everything else she has done.  The anecdotes and the topics are really wonderful.  I particularly liked the parts when she's discussing finding her dream job, but also trying to balance that with the rest of her life (family, etc.).
0307742539|5.0|Great series; entertaining, exciting, and keeps you reading. The entire series is excellent for those who love mysteries, drama, etc. I bought this 3rd book on my Kindle at midnight because I couldn't stand not to know what happened to the characters at the end of book 2!
B00B29J0I6|4.0|My children and I love this game! However the Amazon Game Circle thing pops up way to often.....almost every time I touch the screen, once you get to Love Story #7 I think Roby gets stuck on the everlasting dynamite box. Besides not being able to get him to fit through &amp; pass the level it's a great game, the game circle thing really needs to be corrected though, it messes up levels where timing is everything.

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Choose this rating of 4 star because it was funny.<br />When the kids got trapped in the tube maze, they had to get adults to come and rescue them.<br />I would recommend this book for my friends and family.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Great deal. Great story! So glad I got this, it has saved me from hours and hours of boredom at work. Plus, you get to spoiler all your friends who watch the show but haven't read the books (if you're a douche). Or, you can just tease them with vague hints and knowing looks (if you're more of a douche). Either way, AWESOME!

I really enjoyed listening to the lyrical stories about relationships, him trying to succeed in the music industry and so much other content. I'm pretty sure alot of heart was put in this album. You won't be disappointed.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read all of Hosseini's books and have loved them all.  I like looking through Hosseini's eyes at Afghanistan and the people whose lives he focuses on.  In this book he follows the lives of every character.  It is a book that once you start you have to finish it to see what happens to the characters.  I highly recommend it.

B000002KK2|5.0|Born in Chicago and raised in Texas by a family of vaudevillians, Rickie Lee Jones was always surrounded so it seems by music and horses. After studying anthropology and music formally she began writing songs in earnest,moving to Hollywood and signing with Warner Brothers Records. Since Joni Mitchell and Laura Nyro were mainly creating music to satisfy stalwart admirers, the type of jazz inflected singer/songwriter sound these two iconic female singer/songwriter pioneers needed a fresh new voice to continue this worthy fusion of musical ethics.  With the encouragement of one time boyfriend/fellow songwriter Tom Waits cheering her on and Little Feat lead singer Lowell George including one of her compositions on his solo debut and releasing it as a single,Jones was off to the races.<br /><br />  \\"Chuck E's In Love\\" is probably the song Jones will always be remembered for. Starting with a funky,electric piano led groove juxtaposing into a bassy,jazzier shuffle it is by far the most unusual pop single of 1979.  Much of the songs such as \\"On A Saturday Night In 1963\\",\\"Night Train\\",\\"The Last Chance Texaco\\",\\"Coolsville\\",\\"Company\\" and \\"After Hours\\" are spare,piano based ballads not only emphasizing Jones' vocally gymnastic style but also her love of exploring the major/minor chord style of melodicism as much as possible. \\"Young Blood\\" is one of the earliest songs she's written,another funk oriented uptempo number whereas \\"Danny's All Star Joint\\" goes for strong boogie woogie rhythm & blues with Willie Week's strong bass lines.<br /><br />  \\"Weasel And The White Boys\\" as well as \\"Easy Money\\",the song Lowell George first interpreted are both densely composed jazz type shuffles.  With contemporary jazz aces such as Steve Gadd,Victor Feldman,Tom Scott,Jeff Porcoro as well as synthesizers provided by both Randy Newman and Michael Boddicker, this album creates an extremely rich yet melodic musical tapestry that adapts very well to Jones picturesque tales that live somewhere between the emotional contrasts of confidence and insecurity.  She is basically just starting down the road of the musical life of her own still with this album,and she makes her weaknesses of person obvious in some of these lyrics. Yet as a free spirit seeking to live a looser existence the jazz/funk orientation of her singer/songwriter makes this one of the best marriages of song craft and instrumentation one could find in the American pop scene of the late 1970's.en the emotional contrasts of confidence and insecurity.

It's WONDERFUL to see a major network project some daring and creative production for once.

B007L96SI6|3.0|Haley Reinhart has such a rich, soulful voice that I was quite surprised this wasn't a completely jazzy/bluesy CD.  That's the genre where I think her singing rocks.  The cookie-cutter, pop-style songs just don't do her voice justice and, sadly, won't make her the bigger star that she deserves to be.

B009MYARIK|4.0|I really enjoy Sophie Kinsella stories. She has this wonderful way of taking every day life experiences adds a dash of chaos to it for good measure and you have a wonderful delightful story. Wedding Night was no different super fun with great characters.<br />Lottie is such a fun character full of life, a romantic, in love with Richard her long term boyfriend, and she is slightly compulsive when things don't seem to go right. What do I mean by this is Lottie and Richard are headed to dinner where Richard wants to talk to her. Well her idea of what should be talked and asked about at dinner is a completely foreign thought to Richard. She expects a wedding proposal from him, and has psyched her self up for it. You can image Richards thoughts on the matter as he tells her no not going to happen, and he tells her his big news. Lottie is so heart broken being the romantic she is, yet she is strong and gives Richard what for in her head, stupid man. Lottie is quite cute as she process all of this. Fliss is Lottie's sister who has just been through a gut wrenching divorce and is bitter, bitter, but trying slowly to overcome the bitterness. Surprisingly she was hoping Richard and Lottie would get married, she really likes Richard for her sister.<br />Well Lottie is as if she were the waves of the sea being tossed to and fro she is devastated about Richards rejection. One day she gets a call from an old summer fling Ben, and decides to meet up with him. They were once very good together well so she thinks. Over dinner they decide that it would be a great idea to just get married. What was she thinking, she is a crazy girl. Anyway Ben is rich, sexy, and a dimwit in my opinion. He is so puffed up on himself sometimes I wanted him to get a reality check. His puffed up self really came from his lack of self confidence. There friends and family are none to happy about the upcoming wedding. Fliss is trying to talk sense into her sister but nothing seems to work. Lottie and Ben decide just to eloped and go spend there honeymoon where they first meet. This is a honeymoon like no other, it was hilarious, frustrating, and ends well with all. I loved how it ended. There is also more than one relationship going on in this story. Richard he has somethings on his mind too.<br />Really a fun and enjoyable read!<br /><br />content: clean read, sexual things talked of but no details, fair amount of language
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|ON COURSE IT WOULD ALSO REWUIRE AN ADULT WHO UNDERSTANDS THE MESSAGE IN THE BOOKS. Allowing government to dictate to people without representation of the people will not be allowed. Within the story is that the government was taken over by the political parties who decided what was best for the people, resulting in the rebellion which created the districts. Gray reading for all ages.

I will say that Tony Stark has to be the most prepared guy in the universe.<br /><br />After further improvements in his armor and even getting to a point where the armor comes to him and parts of it can act independently, we find the only reason he's doing this is to immerse himself on what he does well - a mechanism for controlling is panic attacks!<br /><br />We forget sometimes that Tony is just a guy.  A very smart guy but really behind that superior façade it must be a shock that there are aliens and gods in the universe and that he was barely able to hold his own with the technology that he has to hand.<br /><br />Rather than being an advertisement for the earlier Avengers film (and that would be a natural conclusion, LOL), it's similar to Ironman 2 - an exploration into Tony the man.<br /><br />I love the Marvel films because they are more than about the heroics.  This may fall flat with fan boys but the producers want a film that resonates with the general public, and Ironman 3 does just that.<br /><br />Best Scenes:<br /><br />Destruction of the Malibu home yet there is some pretty clever moves that ensure survival from a missile attack by black helicopters.<br /><br />Mid-scene reveal of who The Mandarin really is (and no, he is not a Chinese dictator who has alien rings of power - dang it!) as he is surrounded by beauties.  Humorous bathroom scene.<br /><br />The people that Tony dissed at a 1999 New Years' party and the resultant backlash 20 or so years later.  Some surprises.<br /><br />Though it is scientifically impossible for the body to heat to 3000 degrees, the film made the idea somewhat plausible - the weaponization of scientific discoveries is not completely unheard-of.<br /><br />Pepper Potts kicking some violent action!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Plenty of great action scenes - some ties to terrorism and the media's slavish reporting of it - and the power of what one man can do to either conquer the universe or conquer himself.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br /> [Do stay tuned for the end-of-credits scene!]he idea somewhat plausible - the weaponization of scientific discoveries is not completely unheard-of.<br /><br />Pepper Potts kicking some violent action!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Plenty of great action scenes - some ties to terrorism and the media's slavish reporting of it - and the power of what one man can do to either conquer the universe or conquer himself.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br /> [Do stay tuned for the end-of-credits scene!]

It is hard to do time travel in the final zone. In the final zone, you need to time travel to the past.You also can become tiny.<br /><br />After beating the game as sonic,you can be tails. You also can go super. This game was originally be sonic 2.<br /><br />It was too awesomely awesome to be Sonic 2.<br /><br />And I can see why.<br /><br />P.S. have fun, and there's no secret message (Thank God.

The recipes that are presented would not be edible unless you were the strictest vegan on the planet.  The use of great amounts of starch would be inedible with no oils or condiments.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|Why advertise this product under Kindle Fire search?  Do I need to say more!  I love playing the Temple 2 game but heard so much about the Temple Oz, so did a search and this app does not show!!
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game. It never gets boring and sometimes keeps me up playing all night! I highly recommend this game for everyone.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This movie was better than we thought, very well done and very entertaining. We are senior citizens and enjoyed the movie so much we will rent for our grandsons when they come to visit. Very well done!
B00AECGQF2|1.0|Don't waste your money or time on this game. It is boring and the sounds are disturbing. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A slow, steady story that wraps you in love, sorrow, and humanity. The ending leaves you feeling incredibly satisfied. My first introduction to  Hosseini has made me want to go back and read more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard, but it makes you think, no hints ensure that you have to use your brain. I wish they had more floors. Some floors were harder than others as you got higher. Can't wait to see th next game.
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|The main actor is great as a hobbit.  The excitement of the movie, the special effects and it is fun.  Wonderful movie.  Looking forward to the next in the series.  I read the book before watching the movie.
B009GEYX5E|4.0|Since Polaroid stopped making the 600 film and everything else is ridiculously expensive, I decided to give PX 680 a shot. It's worked just fine for me so far. All I have to say is that it did take a while for the film to fully develop, approximately 10 minutes or so, but it's nothing really to complain about. The pictures came out with a warm yellowish tinge but I think it adds to the \\"vintage\\" effect. That being said, the quality is definitely not going to be as good as Polaroid but this film does its job. If you're like me and just want film to take polaroids for fun, it's worth it to buy these because they seem to be the cheapest option.
B00AMBMF1Y|5.0|Great combination since I enjoy both the subject and the actor.  The story is not surprising but I like the plot and the ending is great.
B0024F08UG|5.0|Paul Newman and Steve McQueen topping a star-studded cast. What more can you say. The Blu-ray version just makes the watching experience that much more enjoyable.
B00004U8P9|4.0|I won't talk about the film, because we all know how wonderful the film is.<br /><br />I'll talk about the extras and discs instead. There are actually two versions of this edition--one is printed in Canada, and the other in the USA. The Canadian version has a very different disc design. It's in solid black with red \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" as well as a photo of Frank N Furter. The Canadian printing is weak and the colors of the digipack case is sort of fade-ish? The American version, however, has fantastic printing/coloring. For some reason, the cardboard paper and ink used for the case is better. The color is more vibrant. The discs also have a different design--tracing the outline of the digipack case's design!<br /><br />I actually ordered this in 2010, and I accidentally ordered this again just last week (2013). I had the American version first, and the one that I accidentally ordered says \\"made in Canada.\\" I opened it just to see if it's any different, and it bloody is.<br /><br />So I'm keeping my old American version.

B00BESJYAY|5.0|This film was outstanding. The acting was excellent, and I really connected with the people in the film. Jay Moriarty was truly a brave and vibrant person. So sad that his life ended so early.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|All of the Star wars movies on Blu-Ray , Like many, i feel the 4-6 (the first 3 that came out) were much better than 1-3, the newer ones.  I'd really like a set of these movies in &#34;Original Theatrical Release&#34; format, without any of the 'enhancements' that have been added over the years.  For a 'collectors edition', the studio needs to pay much more attention to packaging.  There is an outer card held on by rubber 'glue dots'.  If you are not really careful when removing the outer card, then you'll tear the artwork on the outer slip case.  If you ARE really careful, then you'll find that the glue has discolored the image.  When I called the studio's customer service number on the box, they expressed total indifference, saying they are not responsible for packaging.  No complaint with the movies, just the packaging.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|Better than angry birds, this game kept me busy. I really enjoyed it. Graphics are great. Never did like those pesky rubber duckies.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This book was very very good. It is a little hard to understand because it is dated in the older times, but it is a great romance novel.

B000NY12LO|5.0|Another of Jodi Picoult's &#34;can't put down&#34; novels.  This author has truly amazing insight into the minds of teenagers, their need to belong and the crisis of bullying. She also knows the minds and responses of parents and authority figures. A rapid fire novel that says so much about macho teens, their sexuality and risk-taking behaviours! It includes the love/hate relationships that often prevail right into marriage and beyond!  I highly recommend this novel. Court room and legal gambles are a &#34;must read&#34; as well.

1423136802|5.0|Enjoyed reading this to grandchildren (7-9) until (third volume) they took over to reading it themselves--couldn't wait to see what was going to happen.  The writing is so vivid that when the movie &#34;The Lightning Thief&#34; came out, they were critiquing the director's choice of making Percy too old for that early episode. The book's premise leads to a lot of discussion about &#34;the gods.&#34;  Recommended.

B00AECGQF2|5.0|My opinion is that this game is AWESOME!! My mom, dad, and grandma like it. Just lower your price to- 0.50c.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loves this game not to hard not to easy fun to play. My  son even liked trying it and didn't get frustrated with it because it was just challenging enough without being to challenging.
0446554995|5.0|Agent Pendergast is back at it again!  If you have been reading the novels concerning FBI's free-wheeling agent then you will enjoy this book a lot.  A lot of the loose ends from prior books are revealed in this book.  Great read, great story, great synopsis of the life of the agent.  It will surprise you throughout the whole book.

B0062NAX1U|2.0|Disappointed.  The DVD got \\"stuck\\" in the middle, making me doubt that it was a new DVD, which I thought it was.  The content was \\"preachy\\".
0385349947|1.0|I kind of think I am the target audience for this book; I am a working mom in corporate America, at a senior management level, struggling with the decision to go for a director position, which will probably take more time from my family.<br /><br />This book actually motivated me to be less ambitious, rather than more.  I never want to be like Sheryl S.; a huge showoff, motivated to succeed at all costs.<br /><br />Further, I would call this a boring book report, rather than a book with any real point other than trying to blindly force women to be more ambitious, rather than do what's right for their lives.<br /><br />Maybe women are just smarter for choosing to work to live, rather than live to work.<br /><br />Was really annoyed that this book received so much hype - since it does not deserve it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app because the puzzles and levels always keep you thinking. I feel so smart after I beat a level. It's just awesome
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Out of all apps i have tried my horse is the best i have hours of fun with this app. The game play is great carrying for this horse is so much fun. I would pay 5 bucks for this app even though it was free love it and highly recommend this app.

B000IZ8SD8|5.0|I honestly loved this movie. It was so well directed and the actors did a phenomenal job that I could watch this movie 50 years from now and still love it. I highly recommend this movie to any trekkie or non-trekkie alike. A must see!
B003ZSJ212|3.0|The film is excellent and I liked it but was expecting a better quality packaging. Album drawings are very poor.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I don't know how Tom Cruise can be in so many movies and not have them all morph into the same character (like Nick Cage) but he pulls it off.  This movie is fun, smart, action packed and entertaining. Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast nail it.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|The book was a very excitable read. Itkept its balance of drama, action and romance in perfect check . Love the story and the writing style.

B00BB8RKH6|3.0|When it comes to acting and affects, as well as story, this is a good one, and keeps your attention throughout the entire movie as you pray this jerk goes to jail and justice is served. The down side is that it brings into sharp focus the downward slide the trajectory of this society's morals and ethics continues to travel at breakneck speed. It shows how the unions will protect and defend even the worst of it's people, and of course most lawyers will say and do anything for money as we all know. The justice system was never intended to let the clearly guilty go free, but was designed to ferret out the guilty and give them a \\"FAIR\\" punishment, and not the death penalty for jay-walking lets say as an example.<br /><br />In this society, we've made the guilty all victims of our society, when the real victims are now the good people that do the right things everyday and on the side of right. NO ONE is ever guilty today, and deny, deny, deny is the battle cry for any wrong doing or person in trouble. We are a society of lies and half truths and political correctness that has taken us all down. You won't hear the truth today especially from a politician or the news because the TRUTH will offend someone so the entire country suffers so one may feel good about himself and not deal with reality.<br /><br />Denzel does such a good job of acting, you hate this man all the way through the film and pray something bad happens to him, or at least I did. The shame of it all is how much of this film is the truth and smacks of a system gone horribly wrong, and how money seems to rule more than ever in a society where our leaders are corrupt.....our government is totally corrupt...... and big business is the worst of them all. We kill people for money and business in this land of the free and call it something nice of course.....freedom fighting....anti-terrorism.....freeing people and on it goes when in fact our companies make billions and we steal the resources of the country we invade that belong to the people.<br /><br />I ask you this...what have we given our children to look up to? What hero's or examples of goodness that get justice or rewarded at all, have we taught them and left them something to strive for and be like??? I'm afraid the Charlie \\"drugged up foolish clown Sheens, and the Courtney \\"no class\\" Loves far out-weigh the Colen Powell's, and Ralph Naders of our day I'm sorry to say. I can name 100 athletes and stars that would make me sick if they were my kids, and totally ashamed of how I raised them, but in this society........hahahahahahaaha......no one is ashamed anymore no matter what they do or get caught at. In fact, the more of a scum bag they are....the better the public likes them unless it's your neighbor or family that acts like that, and then you want to kill them and have no love at all or patience.<br />The movie is simply too accurate for me to have liked it anymore than I did, as it left me unsettled and ashamed of who we've become.vade that belong to the people.<br /><br />I ask you this...what have we given our children to look up to?

015206057X|5.0|Both Mem Fox and Helen Oxenbury are exceptional authors of books for little ones; this book in no exception. It is a favorite in my household.  As a reading specialist, I am acutely aware of how the rhythm of language in a book & repeated phrases are highly beneficial to young children.  They delight in the familiar refrains that they can learn to say at the appropriate time throughout the reading of a book.  Even younger babies love hearing such repetitive rhythms before they can understand the actual words.  The ending of this book is especially sweet, slightly changing the repeated refrain in a way that toddlers can understand and appreciate.  (As a parent, I love this book, too.  I cried the first time that I read it to my daughter when she was about 3 months old.)[[ASIN:054787006X Diez deditos de las manos y Diez deditos de los pies / Ten Little Fingers and Ten Little Toes bilingual board book (English and Spanish Edition)]]
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I bought this game last year in the green light bundle. The PC-port wasn't that great, but they provided an android APK, so I could play it on my nexus 7. Now it was available as a FAOTD, so I could finally update it to a newer version. This game is great, much fun, the graphics are nice and the controls are OK. I can recommend it to adults and safely recommend it to children. It's very good priced as well.

B003G4W49C|4.0|I felt it was juvenilely written but all and all a good read .  The concepts were unique but I believe that more descriptive detail was needed in order to visualize the battles and fights

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|As a newbie to Doctor Who, this Season/Series 1 is perfect. Now I'm excited to watch all of the Doctors for all Seasons but I'm so glad for this restart.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Ryan Murphy knows how to make an action series that's INTENSE!  Where most TV Series fail is in their inability to maintain that &#34;on edge&#34; experience.  I'd say sit back and relax, but it wouldn't be possible-The Shield will have you frantically pressing play to see what happens in each and every episode.  Chiklis, Karnes, Goggins, Pounder, and Martinez all delivered award winning performances.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|This movie slipped under the radar.  I barely know anyone else who has seen it but the few of us who have were really impressed.<br />Gina Carano pulls off a female action star better than anyone else I've ever seen.  With her background in MMA she's obviously comfortable &#34;manhandling&#34; people, and it shows in the action sequences.  The bigger surprise was that her acting in the non-action heavy scenes was pleasantly solid.  The supporting cast was also excellent.  Though... I can never take Bill Paxton seriously.<br />The storyline is straightforward with a few quirky not exactly hard to see coming twists, but I wasn't left needing any more nuanced story.  The simplicity left the filmmakers with the opportunity to focus on some of the other details like the score and fight scene choreography.<br />The end result was a well rounded action movie with some hard hits and a great leading lady.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Good characters, a lot of the story seemed quite real. Not so sure about the therapist situation, but it made the story funny<br /><br />.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I got this charger for my Galaxy Note 2 which is my primary cell phone. It is a large phone and comes with a high amp charger from Samsung. I have several car chargers that work with the Note, but they are all regular 1 amp devices and with my phone take forever to charge to capacity. With the Anker charger I can use the 2.1 amp plug to charge my note much quicker than a standard car charger. I use the extra port for my wife's phone when she is with me as she always needs to charge it.<br /><br />The design and build quality are great. The device feels solid and well made. It has kind of an Apple feel to it, which given that it is advertised to charge iPads makes sense. Not my particular design choice but doesn't bother me that much.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My newphew and niece back in India loved this.<br />Only thing is tis becomes a little too tough for them at times so I had to relax the rules.<br /><br />One suggestion would be to imrpove the catapaulting abilities to be more elastic for faster collpasing of the structure.

B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I am not sure what I did before I had this app. I love how easy it is to personalize it and create whatever sound works best for you. It seems like I am sleeping with the window open and makes me forget I am living in an apartment complex. I can also set it to remind me of sleeping outdoors at a camp site in the woods. I also love that I can set it to stay on and show the clock so I can simply glance at it during the night without fumbling to turn on my phone. I have the HTC One and if you haven't heard the speakers on that you are missing out. So the sounds on this app sound excellent playing through my dual front facing speakers and it is very immersive.

B009U9S6FI|4.0|If you are even considering this book, it means you should read it. Nothing like a daily exposure to death to straighten one's priorities.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I downloaded this game before I even downloaded the first one because a YouTuber I watch was saying how awesome it was. And let me tell you, this game is fast paced and FUN. I'm not usually the type of person who plays these &quot;adventure&quot; games but Temple Run 2 is addicting.<br /><br />After a while, I decided to download the original temple run and see what the difference was. And while it's the same concept obviously, they are different in a couple of ways.<br /><br />The major thing for me is the graphics. They are so much more clearer and more defined in Temple Run 2. It's like this game is HD and other one isn't, if you know what I mean. Not to mention, there's more obstacles than in the original; mainly the rope but other minor things as well.<br /><br />Plus, I just prefer the layout better in Temple Run 2.<br /><br />Overall, while I like temple run, the sequel definitely &quot;won&quot; at least for me. It's the same game, just improved.<br /><br />-Sarah
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I  would give this app a 5 star rating<br />Because it is very interesting and very affordable and also entertaining
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. It's so fun. I got all the way to level 80 and its no joke. The best shooting app game I seen so far. Glad to have this game everyone should get it it's amazing! (: I'm glad I got it when it was the free app for the day.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|The game is so cool. One of the best app games. If you like shooters, world war 2 game, or any game get for you tablet. Plus its free.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I love this book and this series. This is an author I have liked for a while, but for some reason I didn't want to read this series. I think I was worried it would be too tragic. In a way it is, the premise is heartbreaking: how age forces men and women into space and into war. It is a little silly though, with all the secrecy in the start. And I can't be the only one to have suspected the solution to the age-defying methods...<br /><br />The main thing that delighted me with this and the rest of the books in the series, is that it's delivered without DRM - Digital Righths Management software. This means I can use these books on other readers! Since my son borrowed my Kindle and my husband has a Sony reader I could use; when I wanted to shop books for the vacation it was easy to choose. Here was an author I like and a series I like, and I can use it in different formats without breaking the law! This made me buy a stack of these books from Amazon.
B005R32L66|4.0|Skype is fantastic, great to communicate all over the world with friends and family and you can see them. I love Skype
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|This was a compelling read.  It is an excellent story.  It is a little over the top with descriptive phrases and similies - but the stories told hold you to read 933 pages, which is unusual for this reader.

B00BU9DXAY|5.0|To all the poor confused people who complained about the foul language, I have only one question. Isn't the fact that this guy has a book about punching dolphins a clue that he makes his living being offensive, or do you always buy books from dudes you don't know anything about? He also has a book about cats as serial killers and a vulgar humor webpage. Humor is like that now. Books are like that now. TV is like that too. Think about what you buy before you buy it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Lessons are learned in this highly funny and entertaining animated feature.  Our 8 year old references things from the movie all the time.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I have to say that it was one of the funniest books I have read in a long time.  I love that this vain, egotistical alpha male is brought down to his knees by an alpha woman who is beautiful, smart and ambitious and the story is told by him.  The conversations he has with his male counterparts about their sexual conquests is hysterical and his niece steals the show.  I just read this book for the second time and loved it again.  It's better than a pint of Ben and Jerry's and the latest chick flick.
B00BDAP66E|2.0|This app allows you to view your pages and not much else. Want to create an event? Can't do it here. Maybe the updated version that is NOT available through the Amazon store can, but since we are only allowed what Amazon seems worthy we are stuck with this version that does nothing really. Next time I'm getting a Google Nexus.
B0045HCIYA|4.0|Great shipping, came fast, is as advertised. Had no problems with the CD some do not work sometimes. I would recommend. It was worth the price and Demi looks great and acting for her was great as well!

B00A83075M|4.0|An absolutely fantastic movie and one that the entire family can enjoy.  It has many video game references which as a nerd makes me happy, but it also has a good story line.  Safe for the whole family to watch and really good and well worth the money.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great sharpener and small enough to carry around easily.  I use it for my kitchen knives currently and plan to bring it on future hikes to use with my pocketknives.
B00AG51RU6|3.0|I absolutely adored Henry Cavill in The Tudors and when this movie came out I was happy to see him get a leading role. He is the main character in this movie..not Bruce Willis. There is a lot of edge of your seat action and Henry's character gets put through a ringer. But the movie itself, while enjoyable to watch, just never really told you anything. It was a let down and I don't believe it had anything to do with Henry's part or his acting which was perfectly fine. This was a script issue and not a very good one and he deserves better as well as Bruce Willis. I think many fans of Henry won't consdier it a waste of time but if you aren't a fan then you will be disappointed in this film. Aside from all that there is a lot of action that is enjoyable to watch. Now if you want to see Henry in a major leading man role go see &#34;Man of Steel&#34;. Its a wonderful movie and he is a fantastic new Superman!
B00CSSRPGY|5.0|A very fine CD of music by Elaine Elias. Sultry, smooth, enticing. This is music that my wife and I have enjoyed listening to. What's not to like! Recommended
B009GEYX5E|5.0|Im in love with the PX 680. I have tired all the other films before this one and hated them. The PX 680 is consistent for all the locations that I have used it on. So far never a bad photo. Be sure to check it out.<br /><br />only CON it's a little red/ orange so be ready for that.<br /><br />-Ole<br /><br />PhotOle Photography
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This is the second book of The Ender Quintet. The story is quite interesting, but I believe the first book put me more on the edge.
B001G70M6S|5.0|great film, works great with my crown graphic with polaroid back. very hard to shoot outside if you dont like shooting at high f-stops but perfect for indoor shoots.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|This book is really amazing. While reading this book, I was getting a sense as if I was on the journey with those boys on the walk. There are a lot of themes and deep meaning in this book. If you liked Hunger Games, this book has that similar arena taste where you fight to the end.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I chose this high rating because the book had everything. Will Robie, for me, is one of the most exciting action characters I've had the pleasure to read about. I hope Baldacci continues his adventures as it was captivating from start to finish.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is a fun n challenging game to play. i would recommend if your up to the challenge. have fun.
B00BF123WG|5.0|this was a very well done movie.  Throughly enjoyed this and it was a nice movie night movie and not violent.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|i am addicted to it. every level us designed nice and i will definitely play on if there are more levels. really a good game
B00APJLFEG|1.0|this is awful.  with sandler all talking in a weird voice, pretty awful.  and the animation wasnt even that good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So this game is epic. it has some glitches but the latest update fixed most of that. One thing that I haven't figured out is how to mine redstone ore. Other than that its great.<br /><br />if you want a really quick way to find good ores go to any random spot and dig down. when you come to a place below the surface that has dirt or gravel dig it all out. most likely you will find some ore :)
B0049J2CKE|4.0|this is a movie my daughter and i can watch over and over.  it is really cute.  highly recommend for any movie night!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great brain work out! Could not stop playing, wanted more. Would like a hint section. Or a give up! Even though I was able to work through them all.
0712654194|5.0|This is one of my most favorite books ever. Period. Even if I read many other different books, I keep coming back to this book. I first read this book in the public library but no one appreciated the copy and I got sick of the weird stains distracting me so I went on a little hunt to find this book so I can have my own copy and that was one of the best decisions I made about a leisure book.The plots and the settings are so vivid it feels like I'm in the markets on the streets of London watching these events unfurl and it never gets tiring for me. I'm currently reading Russka, but I still come back to this book ever since I first read it's title nearly 10 years ago
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is absolutely adorable. The graphics are amazing - it's like playing an animated movie. The motions are realistic and I love that you don't have to keep your finger on an item to use it (which can sometimes annoy little ones); just tap and go. It also has twice as many options as other games to keep you entertained. The first day I downloaded it to the Kindle Fire, my 3 year old played it until the battery died. Definitely worth the $3! I'm not sure why a few people have a problem downloading it - we had no issue at all. Please, please put more Toca Boca apps in the store!
B000E1155E|2.0|I needed this cd for class because it was required by my Prof and that's about it. I had to analyze the cd cover to cover and it wasn't my cup of tea. It made for interesting discussions about social justice in the modern world but I haven't picked up the cd since the last time I used it in class
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was a wonderful story of true love, love gone wrong and love remembered!  Such a heartwarming tale that revives your belief in happy endings!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|At first I didn't want to read this because of the subject matter, but I read it anyway and it a was OKay but I didn't love it and I didn't hate it.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|A great tiny book to go though. In a small amount of space the author is able to paint a great picture of what awaits people with respect to employment in the future. It sets a nice backdrop to have a litmus test against by showing historically what things were said and how they have changed. It was nice that the book didn't leave me feeling as if we'd all be replaced by machines, and it showed where both man and machine excel in working together.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|GREAT MUSIC BY A GREAT ARTIST AT A GREAT PRICE!  HE IS THRILLED TO BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO IT ANY TIME HE WISHES!
B001DUKHXQ|5.0|I ordered this as a gift to a family member.  She absolutely loves it.  The transaction and delivery of the album proceeded without a hitch.
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|Having read the book made watching the movie more interesting. I thought it had a balanced blend of romance, suspense with an interesting twist at the end. Good movie to enjoy with a bowl of popcorn.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|I saw this film in the theater when it was first released. It is the the most breathtakingly beautiful, meditative work of cinematic art I have ever seen. Certainly worthy of being called Terrence Malick's masterpiece. The Blu-ray format best presents both the intimate details and the grand sounds of the film.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. It keeps your mind going. It will get frustrating but keep at it. If you need help you can you tube the walk through.
B0094MFITS|5.0|I have loved the Jesse Stone movies since the first (Stone Cold) was released.  I was very sorry to hear that CBS will not be making any more episodes of this show.  I truly enjoyed each and every episode.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I am only 4 episodes in, but hooked!!  Streamed the first few episodes thru Amazon Instant Video, so easy and fast!
1426308469|5.0|My 3 year old grandson just loves this book.  The pictures and the colors have brought the dinosaurs to life.<br /><br />Thank you - National Georgraphic
B00AR3WD8W|4.0|The cd, Aloha From Hawaii is beautiful, loved the four added songs at the end.<br />Wish he had talked more on it but I loved it anyway.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for a daughter's BD & she was happy with it as she had heard nice things regarding it. I haven't heard as yet how pleased she was with it. I, of course, am waiting to borrow it sometime so can not relate much about it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Hard at times but fun and addictive i like the challenge i am sure a cheat sheet is being created as i type this
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I love all the actors in this film. It's a great piece on human emotion and life. Well done. Really loved how it was true to life.  A bit messy and not perfect but ended well enough.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I love it, I even think that it's a little litter than the original ones. Haven't had any problems with it.
0062231375|4.0|an insider's perspective - it was a good read. I would recommend it for someone who is curious about what kitchens can be like and what the life of a chef can be like. Very personal at times. I enjoyed it.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Well done.  I love hearing David Marks metallic chords.  Good song selection, not the songs you previously hear, but some good old ones.  Probably very little from the live concerts except talking, crowd noise.  Suspect most is done in the studio, but that's ok = no mistakes.  Mike, Brian voices still very distinctive when used.  Backup singers sing the falsetto parts perfectly in pitch with no vibrato = good.  Timbre of the original voices not there.  Besides Brian, Carl could sing.  Others, well...  Now Brian is old, but can still handle some of the work, but not multi-level harmonies any longer, just occasional lead.  It's ok.  This is a fine &#34;live&#34; album.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I am not very savvy when it comes to programs but this was very easy to understand and utilize.  I highly recommend!
B0016CP3VC|5.0|Just received it today ,professionally packaged as usual from AMAZON very good .I came onto ELP quite late in my life around about 1996 I think . ELP to my knowledge as never been to Australia. I first brought ELP through their manitcore bootleg series from volume 1 to 4 and amazed by them so much I brought their entire catalogue . Black Moon is a very brassy syth album with keith emerson exploring this voiceing for this album . This has worked very well .Greg Lake is a fine songwriter with his best songs yet on this album. He is a gorgeous singer, farewell to arms a fantastic song ,Carl Palmer is so good at drums I am speechless at some of the things he plays .There you go three elements draw a fantastic supergroup that I ask any new fan of ELP get this album first. As a syth player and heavily into electronic music myself for years .ELP has created a modern classic. The famous synthesizer that first had brass voiceing was the Oberheim synthesizer that was polyphonic .Since then various models have got brass syth patches as routine .I actually don't Know keith Emerson  rig in 1992 when this album came out but looking at some photos I will take a guess being a Yamaha or a Korg .The HIGH VOLTAGE Live set from 2010 explains a lot of  syth brass patches that ELP has draw from that period in 1992. I don't what the status of ELP is at the moment but I would encourage them to have a nother go and this time come to Australia because we have not seen them yet. I hope keith emerson s hand is ok and he can play.<br />Best album track on black moon black moon .all the best ELP .<br />simon macdonald<br />australia
B00CWY76CC|5.0|If you enjoy strategy kinds of games this is one for you. It becomes addictive pretty quickly.  Hours of fun and especially great because it is free.
B00164KYV4|5.0|No, this isn't Academy Award material, but it IS very light, good entertainment!  Every actor is hand-picked for their role and plays it to the hilt, subtle when called for but over the top when needed.  Ginnifer Godwin's character is the lead and she draws you in...very engaging and hopeful.  She aches for someone to love and someone to love her, and no matter how many times she tries and misses, she still tries.  She meets Justin Long's character who seems to be the first honest man she's met.  Their friendship is the leading plot in the movie that has a lot of subplots...all of which are fun, fascinating character studies.<br /><br />The list of excellent actors in \\"He's just not that into you\\" goes on and on.  The acting, as well as the writing, is wonderful.  I won't bore you with my rendition of the stories, but I will highly recommend this movie!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Fantastic story telling with winning performances. DiCaprio gave a stunning performance that had you thinking about him long after you were done watching the film.  Highly recommend.
B00AQF8CJ0|2.0|The game itself is decent, but I cannot stand the idea of IAPs within a paid app under any circumstances.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This film was colorful and fun to watch.  The acting was good overall and the story was easy to follow with a believable picture on how OZ came to be.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|This game is so mind twisting! I love this game. It really makes you think outside the box. My only complaint- they need more levels! They only have 10 levels so I downloaded &quot;escape if you can&quot; which is like the same thing but with different rooms and different codes and that stuff.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Nice play on time and the notion of different selves in different dimensions.  The acting was a bit dull though.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous is the finest in the small, but mighty, offering from the Kendrick Brothers thus far.  We have law enforcement<br />officers in our family and have observed them calling each other to accountability, but this is a new view of the highest<br />kind of accountability... the kind that changes a family, a town, and ultimately a nation.<br />Characters were believable, struggles were real, hardships were handled faithfully.<br />Thanks for creating this kind of cinematic gift.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|A moving story that surrounds familiar feelings like being unrecognized or being an outcast.  Great for kids and adults alike.
0738212415|5.0|I love this book. Considering that I never believed that I could draw, this book changed that. I'm still at the beginning of it, but it has clear explanation of everything and I believe now, that with a little coaching and patience, everybody can draw!
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|Fantastic performance by all in this film!  Smart story that really gets you thinking about human nature and our less admirable qualities.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|Thanks for sharing your story! It was a sad story but I am glad you were willing to share with the world. When I ordered it it I didn't realize it was a true story, just ordered because of author's name.
0525478817|5.0|The book  came in right on time and in perfect condition! no sign of wear or damage either. Excited to start reading!
B00AKS656U|4.0|This is a fun game. For $2, it is quite entertaining. I am playing this on a kindle fire HD so the graphics are great.
B009VQ7ICW|5.0|I am trying to learn python and most books are 'typical' in teaching all the parts and commands step by step. This book throws you in to how you might want to actually use python to do something. Easy to follow, logical and very interactive. An interesting and different approach to learning python.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This book is a good overview of Mr. Teams along with words of encouragement. I highly recommended this book to anyone who wants to learn about great minds and how to persevere.
0062197266|3.0|Not as thrilling as it claims to be but it certainly has its moments. The character of Lee is a sociopath that is written really well reminded me if the husband from Sleeping With The Enemy. I wish there had been some sort of acknowledgement/apology of what happend between Sylvia and Cathy from the past. I know people who have lived this life and this book is spot on.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this game is really fun and interactive for kids of all ages and should come out with more levels ASAP, I would love to see the new games come out really soon.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Amazing writing keep u entwined in the story. Such a cliff<br />hanger ending! Can't wait to read what's next for Gideon ans Eva
B005NFJAZS|4.0|My dad loves this movie and we got it just in time to give it to him for fathers day. Thanks
0525478817|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read (and I a HUGE Harry Potter Fan...). It took me a long time to just get over the fact that it was going to be sad and just read it. I honestly regret how long it took because it is that much longer that this book was not in my life. If you know someone who owns it and is willing to lend it to you, or if you're considering borrowing it from the library, that's great but I'm going to tell you right now, just buy it. You will want to read it over and over again. Augustus and Hazel are amazing characters and you will grow with them, learn with them, love with them, and mourn with them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|These were great room games!  I was sorry when I finished the last room.  Looking forward to more room escape games!
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Once I got started watching, I couldn't stop.  I watched 2 episodes a day and looked forward to it every day. I hear that the show was cancelled on the network and am FLOORED!!  Here's hoping that something more is down the pike. I spent this weekend watching ALL of Season 2 and now I am bummed.
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|so glad they came out with a new album, I love it!  it makes me think of old school chill techno, made by Boards of Canada
B00821OX98|5.0|Absolutely amazing show. Everything from the premise to the aliens themselves to the basic character buildup is spot on with this show.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Good reading and entertaining. With a few twists to keep you engaged. Another hard to put down book by Connelly.
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|This film is a must for any fashionista and delves into the true making of the largest annual fashion issue of a magazine and the work that goes into it.  In addition, the personality of Anna Wintour is explored.
B005XR3K5M|3.0|The cards have fun pictures on them, however quality wise, they are just OK.  They are incredibly flimsy.  You really need to handle them carefully.  They do come in a nice protective box.
B0091LS07E|5.0|WOW!  the name of this CD says it all.  I have listened to this over and over.  Alicia Keyes is a force in the music world.
1781162646|5.0|What a great read....terrific!  Just read it you won't be disappointed.....great characters & story!  It made me laugh & cry.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Alicia Keyes continues to deliver and her music is expanding in many directions.  A true talent and a joy to listen to!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My little girl loves this game! It keeps her busy and she loves taking care of her horse. I would recommend this app to anyone.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This album has a lot going on.  The music crosses over many genres- rap, jazz and blues among them.  It is great listening.  I look forward to part 2/
0060594896|4.0|good guide--easy to read  and good examples. thorough outline and guide to help negotiate the success principles and action plan implementation
1451695195|3.0|Proof of Heaven is an enjoyable read by a bright, conscientious, admirable man. I finished the book having no doubt that he had enjoyed an extraordinary psychological/spiritual experience. As have many tribal shamans, he—in his case, without trying!—found a way to access a dimension many of us can barely imagine. While one man's interior experience could not convince me that heaven was a physical location, Dr. Alexander does portray, quite vividly, a substrate to existence that is based on love. Even if his experience is purely imaginative—and he cites evidence that it could not be—it speaks well for him, and it's a pretty cheering message for us all!
8866131350|5.0|The shipment was fast and the packet was well kept and new. I was not at all disappointment. not even for a moment. I just love it.<br />thank you.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|nothing comes close to perfection quit like tony bennett.. to see and hear is a real; treat ...this duet brings out the true impact he has on others  tony gets better with age thank you tony bennett
0385349947|4.0|I think Sheryl Sandberg provides some great practical advice for those of us women trying to balance it all and lead in our organizations.  She is a bit right of center for my tastes as I do not want to become a man to achieve success.  I would like to see more men in organizations adopt a nurturing, paternal and caring attitude to help organizations thrive.  The tech industry provides some great examples of this...
B0052GACNM|5.0|tony is in control,, It has been my pleasure to fill the air with tony bennett`t  sound of music for decades and his sound just keep getting better.I look forward to many more decades of the man and his velvet smooth voice
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love it , can't stop playing. Wish I can get further but I keep hitting things. I have to let my kids play to get further. I'm having trouble getting my score on Facebook.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|Works good for the first several levels then gets stuck on a load screen, could just be my old tablet, but it was marked as compatable.
B0012GMV58|5.0|Welcome was first released in November 1973 and finds the band continuing on in the direction of the band's last album, Caravanserai. New members are added as well as having a slew of guest musicians' helping out in the proceedings. This line up is also the one that would appear on the live album [[ASIN:B0000027D5 Lotus]] which was recorded around the time the band was recording this album. This is one of Santana's must have albums from is jazzy era. The bonus cut, Mantra, is a really nice extra and fits in well with the original album.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Put all these superheroes together, and you've got a mix of fun, action, funny moments, and all-around good acting (they didn't skimp on the actors here). It won't win any Oscars, but who cares, this is about spending a couple of hours losing yourself and having a good time.<br /><br />Visuals are excellent and sound is awesome, especially if you have a sound system that will do it justice.
B000024SPA|4.0|Santana released Amigos in the Spring of 1976 with the band hiring an outside producer and heading in a more FM friendly direction. The album is a bit of a mixed bag with three standout songs Dance Sister Dance (Baila Mi Hermana), Take Me With You and Europa (Earth's Cry Heaven's Smile). Gitano is an okay Latin flavored number but the rest sound like songs you'd in the background of an episode of Barretta or something. I knocked it up to four stars because the songs on here that I like, I REALLY like. This 2003 edition has the original artwork restored.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The hunger games series  is a great read.  I really like the characters and the action.  The one thing that is difficult is the end of this book, without giving away any spoilers I will just say: prepare yourself and let the games begin!
B0012GMXYM|5.0|Borboletta was first released in October 1974 and picks up where [[ASIN:B0012GMV58 Welcome]] left off. This is the last in a string of Jazz inspired albums by the band starting with [[ASIN:B005F9TQBU Caravanserai]]. I happen to love Santana's jazz albums as much as the first three. The songs on Borboletta are very atmospheric  and have a great feel to them. I can't really add much to what's already been said about the masterpiece so just buy it now.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Sherlock is smart, funny and suspenseful! Benedict Cumberpatch is a perfect fit for the role and Martin Freeman keeps him in check as the rational Dr. Watson. I love Sherlock!
B004SDEP38|5.0|the office to go documents, are helpful, when I'm working on my mother's reports and other types of forms she uses.
0897502027|4.0|This book contains very detailed looks at Bruce Lee's thoughts on martial arts in general and the Jeet kun do style of his own creation. You can also find some of his general philosophical thoughts at the beginning of his book which is a good introduction to understanding his perspective.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game to play with your younger children. My son enjoys helping to care for his horses and I love seeing what he names them.
0345803485|5.0|i love them all i've more then once i have all three books can not wait till movie comes out
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|This is a game for kids, not for porn loving masturbating single people. Why put porn on it? It is so childish!
B008G3N71W|5.0|Feel guilty having got this exquisite novel for free and wanted to give back something to the author by saying this is a gem. If you are into the whole dom-sub training thing, there isn't a better book that I have come across. 5 big stars.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|the game is great love it but to get hero's is too hard . it takes too long of playing to get one good hero unlocked.and it seems like all of the free hero's are weaker.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|If you're a fan of the show, this includes all of the original episodes as well as the made for TV movies!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Was not what I expected at all - it was fun and had quite a few twists and turns - would watch again.
B00177Y9ZC|2.0|The premise of \\"Jumper\\" is an interesting one.  It deals with a young boy, who is living with his father (both were abandoned by his mother), and discovers that he has an amazing superpower that allows him to teleport from one place to another anywhere in the world, in an instant.  He inadvertently discovers this while trying to escape drowning in an ice-covered lake.<br /><br />  Flash forward several years, and this boy, named David Rice (Hayden Christensen), is now in his 20's and is living a hedonistic, but low-key, lifestyle based on his ability to teleport in and out of banks without notice and make off with a fortune.  While most of the populace have no clue that this is happening, Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson), of a collective called the Paladins, has tracked David down.  It seems the Paladins goal to strike back against and exterminate all of these 'Jumpers'.<br /><br />  On the surface, this seems like there could be a very impressive contest of wills and skills between David and Roland.  Unfortunately, the promise is wasted on a relatively pedestrian plot.  Yes, there are battles between the two sides and travels exotic locales.  However, the intensity never rises above a low-grade fever.  Normally, cinematic whipping boy, Hayden Christensen, would take the fall for something like this.  However, he holds up his end just fine.  The fault lies with the uninspired direction of Doug Liman.  This is particularly disappointing since he was responsible for films like \\"Swingers\\", \\"Go\\", \\"Bourne Identity\\" and \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\".<br /><br />  There is a sequel in the works.  Hopefully that films picks of the pace so that this one can just be categorized as another in a long line of underwhelming superhero 'origin' films.
B000SZK41M|5.0|Who doesn't love Die Hard - I'm watching with my teenagers now to bring them up to speed on all of the classics :)
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|John McClane is a classic action hero, but he should have retired gracefully after the excellent &#34;Die Hard With a Vengeance&#34; (1995). Instead, we're saddled with the CGI overkill of &#34;A Good Day to Die Hard.&#34; Bruce Willis' reliable screen presence is the only redeeming feature in this hopeless mess. The worst (and mercifully last) installment of the franchise, which deserved to go out on a stronger note.
B00CDFWJIG|1.0|I had high hopes for this one, but, it was really bad... *sighs* the legacy of Twighlight I suppose... *sighs*
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Very useful and easy to use. There are enough options to please anyone. I use it almost every day.<br /><br />Thanks a million.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As withKhaled Hosseini's two previous novels, I was transported to a different world. Each character is as vivid as the next and their stories are intertwined in a way that breaks your heart and lifts you up a the same time. I do not know the proper literary terms to offer a professional view of this book. I just know that I was sad when I finished and know that there are people in that world who I am glad that I have been introduced to and I won't soon forget them.
0670026603|5.0|Great read.  The main characters were very endearing.  I could not put it down.  She made me think about what it means to be a quad, and gave me a whole new understanding of what that really means.  I love when I get a whole mindset/point of view that was not in my head before reading!  Bravo!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I would recommend this and have many times. Very enjoyable, and great for competative friends! I have not played the other versions but look forward to doing so. :)
8866137979|4.0|This is well made, the usual moleskine work, but the Hobbit touches were nice. The map was well received as was the cover which is low key, not Hobbit written everywhere. Would buy one for general use.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Clary is an amazingly relatable character in a story that was obviously well-thought out. It was a smooth read that sucked me in. I haven't been able to put it down!
B00AATV046|4.0|I have seen the movie many times before. I just wanted to add it to my holiday collection. It's great for getting into that Christmas Spirit!
1455526959|4.0|This is a real page turner with lots of twists and turns.  I would reccomend it for anyone who enjoys the Bosch series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|WHO CARES ABOUT WAITING THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME IT SHOULD TAKE THAT LONG TO UPDATE, and all the sissees who think Craft Zombieland, Survival craft, block world, or any others think that minecraft is worse they are LOSERS!!! GET THIS GAME NOW (minecraft is worth 7 dollars)
B00CATSONE|5.0|I found this book to be fascinating.  It is well written and easy to understand and at the same time it gives you a deep insight into the work of Tesla.
0984183523|5.0|this book is nicely set up. Explains everything very well. Especially if you dont know much about the case interviews like me, it is a great book to start off.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Except for the fact that our connection was so bad that it took 6 hours to watch.<br />Most frustrating. We increased our speed service, but on Friday nights. Prime just can't cut it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is fun. I all ways wanted my own horse now I can. Love this app. Every one should try this game.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Computer animation was well done, very much eye candy bit they went a little shallow on story and character development.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|I LOVE Michael Buble - and have since he hit the billboard.  I've got all  of his CDs and have never been disappointed.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Greatly entertaining move, classic Terintino. This is a good story and buckets of blood to boot. highly recommended, a fun trip.
B000SSPL2Q|5.0|Both performance and recorded sound are excellent.  I have like Symphonies numbers 2, 4, 5 and 7 for years.  These are beautiful recordings of these, with good thought put into the music.  I had never heard numbers 1, 3 and 6.  They appears to be performed and recorded just as well, as do the tone peoms, most of which I had never heard.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|This was a cute twist on the old zombie thing, sweet and fun but a little thin on context. I'd recommend it for a weekend view when you want something light and entertaining
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|It needs way more time 2 acshily play game but its a rilly fun game I just needs more time
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is such a cute, cute, cute, movie....Loved it! The story is great and what a funny bunch of minions. Really enjoyed this movie and I don't even have any kids.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|My son loves this game and he cannot put it down. If he could play it all day, he would!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Very good movie, funny and poignant all at the same time. Barbra is great, overly concerned in a funny way.<br />.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My son loves this game! If he could, he would play it all day and night. He is never bored with this game
B00CV59YC2|1.0|I was hoping when I read the reviews of this MP3 I would really like it but I don't.  The lead singer's voice is not to my taste.  I prefer Tegan & Sara way over them!!!!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I love this book! It had me engaged from the beginning. I would definitely recommend this book to another reader.
B00BY8DIT2|3.0|Love Beth Hart however, Joe Bonnamassa can bring tears to your eyes when he plays the Guitar!!!!  Need to hear Joe More!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This was a really good book. it kept me engaged and I didn't want to put it down. However, I thought the first book was better than the 2nd and 3rd book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is so convenient to be able to access my library of books wherever I am on my tablet and Enjoy!  And then if I happen to be sitting at my PC, I can pick up from where I left off.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book! It had me engaged from the beginning. I would definitely recommend this book to another reader.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|this show kept me falling off the chair every time...i never knew lawyer are smart but this show is much smarter lawyer just kidding!!!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The last book was ok. It was hard to get through it. Unfortunately it did not keep me engaged and it was hard to finish it. The first and second book was a lot better.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|i cant believe how hook i am in this show. in the begining i thought this show was stupid but i glad i gave another chance to watch it and now i am hook with this show. i cant wait this fall to come back
B008HJGPVO|3.0|Each  capacitive tip is very good and the feel of the stylus is nice. It would have been a great product if one of the three tips was a pen. I do not see the need for three capacitive  tips.<br /><br />It would have rated much higher in my opinion if it included a pen. That would cut down on items in my pocket.
B0053O89WY|5.0|this show is awesome and i love every minutes of it. it worth of your money to watch this dvd show and u will love it!
0785168109|5.0|Good article!!I love that so much and I hope all ironman will love that great book!!!Enjoy and you cant miss that!!

B004TI1WME|5.0|This app is wonderful.  No troubles and does exactly what promised.  It's just like having a &#34;Hot Wizard&#34; over the &#34;Willard&#34;.  Seinfeld fans will understand.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Each and every GG dvd is here.  Always good for days you need a pick me up. The set is a good size too - heavy though.  I like the handle!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This one is a cool app for messing around with drawing or similar items.  Can spend some time messing with it.
140053271X|4.0|Its perfect travel size. Easy downloads. I just love it ! Came in pretty fast and even though the case had some wear it was amazing. Thanks !
B005CRQ2Y4|5.0|This guy was writing this lithe prose in the early 60's.  His rock n'roll style predates a lot of later writers.<br />His idea of a secret alternative mail service seems pretty good in the NSA surveillance era.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I have the cd loaded on my work computer and when I NEED to tune everyone out, I put on the headphones and get into my RAM!!<br /><br />I never would have even considered this if it had not been for the collaboration with Nile Rodgers!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Always a treat. I love the story and find it as usual, hard to put down. I have told several friends about the Lee Child/Reacher books and they all love reading them.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It's one of the best games  I have ever played<br /><br />I will play it again I already have  cursed heart I can't wait to play it
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was a little slow starting but once I got into it couldn't put it down. I will be ordering all of Lee Childs books. He has such a way with details you almost seem to be living the part.
B008X8P8A8|5.0|This is a very fun and exciting hex-style real time strategy game. The game has a great campaign to play through and enjoy and it also includes a skirmish mode to increase replay value. You can upgrade units and get more using experience points that you earn throughout missions. There is also an offline multiplayer mode to play with your friends. Overall its a great game worth the money. I recommend it to strategy fans.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love to be engulfed by a good story - so deeply that I am right there with the characters (I think that's referred to as stalking in the real world). Ocean at the End of the Lane is all that. I wanted to keep reading to see where it went next and was very sad when I got to the end because it was over (for me, anyway. Their story goes on out there somewhere).<br /><br />Seamlessly blending \\"reality\\" and \\"unreality\\" it poses more questions than it answers.<br />Sometimes it's a cheat when stories do that, but it was the nature of this story to be that way and is very fitting for a Neil Gaiman story. Life is not always wrapped up in neat little \\"and this is why it's so\\" packages.<br /><br />Thanks Neil!<br /><br />p.s. Never compare one book with another - it's like comparing you current lover with former one(s), somebody's going to lose and it's a pointless exercise anyway since their not the same thing.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Great game that offers fun and challenging puzzles, while being very easy to pick up and put down in your free time. Definitely worth a buck.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|It leaking gave me a chance to cancel my pre-order after listening to it a couple of times. There are 3 songs I like on it, Black Skinhead, New Slaves, and Bound 2. But he switched up the ending to Black Skinhead and I probably won't be giving it another spin in the whip. The rest is literally headache inducing. Loud abrasive \\"beats\\" and screaming fill the rest of the very short album. Lyrics sound muddled but you aren't missing much because the lyrics are simple and nothing to write home about. Save your money and download it for free.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Came out the same year as Shrek, which won the awards, but Monsters Inc is the better movie. Withstands the test of time.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I thought the author did a good job with the Christmas spirit and funny at the sametime I think other people can enjoy this book
B001P9EQH8|5.0|This unit works good.  We needed it to boost the sound on our ipod for my husband that has some hearing problems.  It works for this and is small enough to fit in the pockets made for the ipod.  Does a good job for us.
B007SGM084|5.0|To be honest I did not think I was going to like this book at the beginning. It wasn't  till I got in deeper and there was an actual story line that I became engrossed in the book and was finding it hard to put down. Even when I put it away for the night I found myself getting it back out and reading it some more. I loved how the book ended but I think it could have gone on more! Maybe another book could be in the works as a follow up to this one?
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I first read Girl Gone, and thought I would try another Flynn book, not only was it hard to follow there were large portions left untold and/or poorly described.  The characters seemed half way constructed personality wise and lots of attention was given to sexual features of a hand full of characters making them seem unreal.  The story plot was investing and kept me reading to the end however the end was weak and seemed thrown together to meet a dead line.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game had me wanting to finish it as soon as I downloaded it.  Very engaging for a couple hours. I'll be downloading the others if I have some time to kill.  Some objects are a little tricky but at still easy.
B0053XM7ZU|4.0|The Storm of Swords was well written and full of suspense from start to finish. I was also pleased that one of my favorite  characters, the great KING STANNIS still lives. I highly recommend this book.
B00004CX86|1.0|This was not in the U.S. format, could not view movie.  Wrong format. since it was inexpensive, did not bother to send back.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a series that holds your interest.  It shows how life changed in Great Britain during the 1910s and 1920s very well.  The characters are well portrayed.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Fun just wish u didn't need so much coins to buy the best guns. But all and all it a great way to pass the time
B000FBJFSC|5.0|What a great book to stummble upon.  The raw emotional pain felt while reading was heartbreaking.  It was a page turner.<br />Got to the end and wanted more.  So I purchased book 2.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Update: Before you hook up this mouse go http://www.ianker.com and download the newest driver.Its version 1.1.The software is include in the driver package.Someone also mentioned in the reviews that software is confusing to configure for gaming.On the main software dialog screen, you will see a picture of the mouse with the 9 programmable buttons.Pick a number that correlates to that button, and left click to bring up the scroll menu.Go to single key, and change that to whatever button you want associated with that number.Click ok and apply.<br /><br />If your on the edge on which mouse to buy, look no further.This is it.I will not go into all the details because the previous reviews covered this subject.Go on You Tube, and search for some video reviews of this mouse.It will answer all your questions, and give you a visual idea of what your buying.The packaging is very professional.It also includes weights to put in the mouse, which is a nice bonus.Some people like a heaver mouse vs a lighter mouse.I love the feel, and it's easy to get to all the buttons. 9 programmable buttons is what I call options. Next, the software.This was very intuitive with a wide range of options.Love the interface.Changing profiles is another option I liked.Go from gaming to media with a press of a button.Lastly, the cord strength.Instead of some cheap cord, your getting a braided cord that seems durable.You will not find a better mouse with all these options for the price.Your putting the big boys to shame with this beauty.I plan on getting another one for my other pc.You made gaming fun again.Don't ever give up the 3 buttons on the side.Great design, and perfect for FPS.<br /><br />I would like to thank Anker for such a great product.You are #1 in my book.You guys go the extra mile here.I will be looking very closely at other products you have to offer.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Definitely one of the best seasons in the series. It is up there with season 4. This is a great way to spend 12 hours.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I could not put this book down for long. When you expect the story to go one way the unexpected has happened.
B006IGZWB2|3.0|The characters in the film seemed exaggerated in their stereotyped, southern, almost hysterical portrayals.  As people, the characters were not believable or genuine, which left the whole film feeling as though it barely scratched the surface of the motives and energy of the people being portrayed.  I didn't hate the movie, but I didn't love it either; sadly, it was just okay.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Our whole family really enjoys Castle and we were happy to have this season on DVD!  We are looking forward to when Season 5 is available!
1781162646|5.0|More of a coming-of-age story than anything else, \\"Joyland\\" is reminescent of \\"The Body\\", one of King's finer works, proving once again that King can really write contemporary fiction and does not need to venture into horror and mayhem to achieve success.  This brief novel is beautifully written and features a wonderful narrator dealing with some of life's challenges, especially regarding love and loss. Highly recommended.
0143038583|3.0|I bought this book because I was genuinely interested in the topic but couldn't get through more than 50 pages.  The writing is at times dense and cynical.  I was looking for a less biased review of how our foods makes it from the farm to the table.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game,i like it because 2 reasons,1 i love animals and dinosaurs and i love to take care of them 2 you dont have to pay money on the game to play alot like others!!!
B006F8HZYK|5.0|Since my copy was left behind in storage when I headed off to graduate school... proper writing intensive... I've really missed my &#34;cheat book&#34;. Finding it a kindle 2011 version for $0.99 was a steal in my opinion. Now I can argue commas with my advisor with something to back me up. :^)
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A sublime  narrative of the journey of the soul that  let us to the path of the self fulfillment.  inspirational
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I love the exercise options provided and the ability to customize which muscle group(s) you want to target. The auto generated workout was a bit lackluster and I didn't notice an option to have it randomize. There are so many other exercises in the customs than what it put together. It felt like a waste of potential. Other than that if I don't have time to look up a workout from Zuzka Light for the day this app is an excellent go to substitute.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Loved this book. Could not put it down. It makes you wonder how far a parent can go in defending their own child. How strong is a parent's love?
B009LMTDL0|5.0|even if she doesn't fully agree with all of Sandberg's conclusions.  Highly recommended as a conversation-starter (if nothing else).  My BF is reading it and I think it will help us talk about some of our shared goals and plans for the future.  Sandberg is refreshing because she's speaking from her own experience.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Entwinded with You was a good read. It wasn't as good as the first 2, but I still enjoyed it. Like others have said, I think it was lacking in plot. I thought this was the end so the closer I got to the end the more frustrated I got. I was like \\"it can't end like this!\\" I'm glad it's not ending. I'm not ready to see Gideon and Eva end. There are so many things left unsaid. I just hate that I am going to have to wait for the next book to come out. I'm ready to find out what happened. The ending kind of sucked. It wasn't really a cliff hanger, it just ended. I will still continue to read to find out what happens. People say they are done and won't buy the next book, but how can you get so connected with the characters and just walk away not knowing what their future holds? I can't....I really want to find out what becomes of their relationship and the people around them.
B000000OF6|3.0|I enjoy listening to and singing along to Queen songs on the radio and wanted a CD with a good selection of their HITS.  I looked at reviews for the several Queen Greatist Hits compilations and decided that this one would be best.  Disk One is exactly what I expected.  After the first 2 or 3 songs on Disk 2 the music was unrecognizable.  Sorry, I'm a casual listener, not a Queen groupie and I've never heard most of the Disk 2 songs, let alone consider them \\"Greatest Hits\\".  Someone who is really into this group might appreciate these selections, but I would not consider them \\"Greatest Hits\\".  Just my opinion, but I felt Disk 2 was a waste, I didn't enjoy it at all.
B004VOBIE8|5.0|I have used this App often over the last month and found it extremely useful.  I believe most (or all) would find it extremely  easy to use on a frequent basis.<br /><br />Lewis J
1451668945|5.0|Everything you expect from Clark.  Strong women as central characters, and the men are mostly worthless.  That's why we love her
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|It was a fun movie that takes you to the beginning of how it all started. Our family loved it.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I love this series so much I'm quoting Fargo when he visits the Doctor. Six more words are required for this review.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Definitely two thumbs up for Sandra Bullock and the cast of The Blind Side. Great, powerful, and heart clenching movie.
B000008JI1|2.0|Having been around to follow Poison from the start i found this album dissapointing kuz i felt they wher try to melt into the grunge bunch when if they had waited it wouldnt have been long before grunge died a quick death thankfully ! Their latest albums have them back to what they always was ! They never needed to make deep music for those who overthink every word and instead just make it fun again ! Music is made to have fun with , not to over think every word ! Read a book for that !!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great puzzle game for adults and kids! My 8-year-old son has it on his Kindle and he finished it before me!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Repetitive......how many times do we need to hear about the foil from the condom package...<br />It is a good love story, though
B009MYARIK|3.0|I am usually a HUGE fan of Sophie Kinsella but this book was very disappointing.<br /><br />Lottie thinks her boyfriend is going to propose, he doesn't, so she decides to marry an old fling and fly off to Greece on their honeymoon. Well her sister, knowing this is a huge mistake, tries to stop her. The entire book is scenario after scenario of outlandish schemes her sister uses to keep Lottie from consummating her marriage. And while she's coming up with (unrealistic) scheme after scheme, she's being delayed and delayed from making it to Greece herself to talk to her sister.<br /><br />The entire book was not believable and you wanted to reach in and shake the characters or slap them around a bit. It's one of those books that makes you scream the OBVIOUS thing to do in that situation. It was rather frustrating.<br /><br />Pretty bummed about this book, I waited a long time for it and I know the author is capable of so much more.
1451695195|5.0|I have read two other books on this subject and this one is heads and shoulders above the others. The best feature is the vivid description of Heaven.  I bought 6 additional copies for my friends and family. If this doesn't make them believers, nothing will.
0756666937|5.0|Bought this for my son for his 7th bday and we love it.  Awesome pictures and descriptions of all the Lego sets made.  We enjoy looking at it together.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Vaguely reminiscent of the mid-90s &quot;Myst;&quot;  a visually appealing universe devoid of character interaction which requires thinking-- instead of bashing-- to reach successive levels. The ads, few and far between, are easily ignored. For a better experience, turn off the (regrettable) in-game music.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Kanye has been Hip Hop orchestrator par excellence for the last decade, layering seamless complexity in great music and taking detours. As a fan, I long decided not to second guess him , latch on the seat belt and go for a ride, assured that in his self described inability to be satisfied, nothing will be overlooked on a Kanye owned track. Appreciating his craft and knowing that I would find a lode in what he settles on long enough to dish out, I am happy to say he once again does not disappoint on this album. Even going for a minimalist sound, he still packs neuron sparking, ear pleasing complexity, that trademark of his that keeps one finding new grooves, trenches in which to huddle and appreciate his come ons from, each trench presenting a kaleidoscope of its own. How he does it, I don't know but this guy's synesthesia, ear and work ethic combine to put incredible pressure on my ears to dissect, reason out and keep up with. I suppose just as I can still, after countless listens, go back to College Dropout and hear it fresh and as compelling as the first time, so will it be with Yeezus. While immensely enjoying this as much as every one of his past albums, I cannot wait to see what new direction he takes us in next time.
1567184855|3.0|The subject matter was interesting, but sometimes tedious and redundant. I have set it aside for awhile and will come back to it later.
0316247545|5.0|First printing hardcover makes this brand new book all the more exhilarating. Filled with facts and figures about the MLP:FiM series including all three (2-1/2 actually) seasons thus far. I can hardly wait for season four to start. Printed completely in the style of the animated series with all the colorful design that makes the original show so popular with kids of all ages.
1439152802|5.0|This is my second Kate Morton read. This book keeps you turning the page. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy the journey!
0553801473|4.0|I love the HBO series, so I read the first 4 books, and got this as soon as I could.<br />I noticed this one did drag a bit, as did the 4th one, but I am still going to stick with it to see who ends up<br />Sitting on the throne.<br />This one also has some added twists that were unexpected.<br />Over all, a good read.
B007N85POS|5.0|My daughter loves it and so do I and my husband everybody sould download it and play it its fun for the whole family
B005544TRQ|5.0|I like the general plots. looking forward to the other seasons. I wish it was on Netflix. The interface is better for me.
B00A81MV3U|3.0|The movie is excellent. Highly recommended. The acting is amazing.<br /><br />The extras were lame. There's a 30 minute &#34;patting ourselves on the back&#34; extra and 30 minutes of deleted scenes and not much else. Sadly there is no commentary track explaining the goals of various confusing scenes or information on Pat's mental illness or any entertaining chatter. The extras were a disappointment. If extras are important to you, you'll probably be disappointed. If you're  just interested in the movie, it's great.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|You will cry and you will laugh.  You will be touched deeply by this book and will not be able to put it down.  I have to find another by Christina McKenna.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I thought this would be the perfect trashy read for the start of summer, especially since the two previous Crossfire books were such guilty pleasures. In fact, I pre-ordered this book within seconds of reading the previous novel since it ended on such a cliffhanger.<br /><br />Oh, that cliffhanger? Aside from making it difficult for Eva and Gideon to be seen together, it was really glossed over in favor of pages upon pages of the two having possibly the most boring interactions possible. They watched television together. They ate pizza together. They talked about how much they loved each other. SHOW DON'T TELL. About three-quarters of the way through, the author finally realized she needed a plot and started throwing things at the wall in hopes that they'd stick and THEN, the book just... ends. With the notation that another two books would be coming!<br /><br />Last time I checked, a trilogy was three books. Not five.<br /><br />There are plenty of trashy books out there by better authors. I won't be wasting my time with Sylvia Day again.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this show.  It is very heartwarming to see a family series like this one.  It is witty, intelligent, heartwarming, and humorous all at once.  I so enjoy the costumes and the hairstyles.  I recommend this to anyone who loves history as much as I do.
0345529057|5.0|These books are absorbing without stressing you.  They are entertaining with that &#34;I care&#34; quality.  They create vivid pictures in your mind.
B00138GZAC|5.0|I have these songs on albums and/or cassettes.  I did not want to take the time to convert my prior versions.
