B000FA675C|5.0|Truly a great book. Love the ability of Dan Brown to weave historical information into a captivating work of fiction. My only disappointment is that he hasn't written enough other books for me to enjoy! For a similar writing style, I've moved to Steve Berry.
B001QB9ETK|4.0|I prefer a movie with lots of dialogue.  This didn't provide that, however it did demonstrate that someone can change, which is heartwarming.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|It's what he does and you can't beat that! I don't know why they make you type so many words!
B000PUV1ZI|4.0|My kids and I watched this together and we loved it.  As always, hoffman and williams put on a good show.
B000FA675C|5.0|Another great book by Dan brown. It keeps you hanging on until the end.  The characters are well developed and the ending is definitely not predictable.
1442419814|3.0|This was an okay book,  I didn't enjoy it as much as it was unrealistic. It wasn't my kind of books that I usually like to read.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|It is a quality movie. :)  Just what I expected.<br />The kids love this movie...and I enjoy it as well.<br />Who doesn't tear up at &#34;baby of mine&#34;
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|It's was a very interesting movie, one that you needed to follow closely. A good depiction of the hostage crisis situation!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Second book continues to keep you interested & intrigued. I couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the 3rd book in June.
B00B3MN65K|4.0|Great singer and songs. Make me feel good. Love listeniing to this man sing.Try it, you'll like it. OK? Ok
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Jeffrey Archer does it again, after reading part 1 couldn't wait for next book in this trilogy. Now waiting for part 3.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|By far this is the best show HBO has developed. I'm a True Blood fan and I didn't<br />think I'd like any other HBO series, but Game of Thrones is the best. I love watching<br />the prior episodes and the new ones that have just begun the 3rd season. I haven't<br />read the books I'll admit, but I didn't want to ruin watching the series. You know that<br />saying &#34; the book is better than the series&#34; well I don't know. I plan on reading the<br />series when the show goes off the air, which I hope won't be for a very long time.<br />I highly recommend this series! By the way, I'm a woman and the show rocks!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I love this book!!  Many thanks for the quick shipping and the quality of the product!!  I would order from you again!!
B00004WG2F|5.0|Loved this story of a man raising three sons and how hard times were back then. As if they are tough now but thought all of the actors did a great job playing who they were.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book!!  Many thanks for the quick shipping and the quality of the product!!  I would order from you again!!
B0042RJWTM|5.0|What a great western and Lee Marvin was so good in it. Loved the plot of the story as the great west was coming to an end. I would recommend seeing this movie if you are a western fan.
B000002KB8|5.0|Just a classic medal album from Ozzy and the crew.  Even after all these years it still sounds great.  Cheers
B0001XAPX8|5.0|I was very pleased with this film. The story is good and the choice of the actors is wonderful. All those actors are very credible.
B000MQRE4C|5.0|I had seen this film years ago and had carried with me through the years a memory of a truly engrossing evening at the movies.  I was not disappointed to see Barry Lyndon again - it has not lost its magic.  Story, scenery, charactgers, mujsic - just plain delightful.
0783225733|5.0|The story is good and well adapted for ordinary people.<br />It is easy to understand what those astronautes lived during their return to Earth.
B003QSPTAY|5.0|I have also seen this movie so many time and never get tired of it.  I love the acting and the stars and of course the stroy line.<br /><br />Even though some of the techniques in this film are outdated and not up to today's standards the movie was a head of its time in the day.<br /><br />I will watch this movie on my Kindle very often if I can (time constraints).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book didnt go like I thought it would when I started it But to my surprize it was much better! I LOVED IT!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a fun, well made animated film. I watch it over and over, never tiring of it. Good for kids as well as adults with a sense of humor.
1400069742|5.0|A splendid work..Well written and well-researched..The years leading up to WW2 were angry ones. The country was very deeply divided over the problems in Europe, with a President trying to endure the gap between what he would like and what was possible. Lynne Olson's book brings back  names like Burton Wheeler, Gerald Nye. William Borah and so many others who played key roles in those trying years before Americas entry into the war.Then there was Charles Lindbergh, an American hero, who was fascinated with Nazi aviation advances and unwittingly allowing himself to become a pawn in the propaganda game.<br />This book is groundbreaking history; a riveting account of some very difficult times.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellent acting but better scripting.  The story moves quickly from topic to topic with the introduction and elimination of characters.  You have to stay up.
1439102813|3.0|A good read for someone facing early onset, but shouldn't think the symtoms go in order that Alice's did.  There are better books .
B008XG1X18|5.0|I JUST LOVE PINTREST IT HAS GIVEN ME SO MUCH INFORMATION AND IDEAS! LOVE LOVE LOVE  SPEND ALOT OF TIME ON PINTREST
B0064MPXFA|4.0|This Show have great character development & the cases are engaging & intriguing. If you are an fan of Legal shows you should give this show a try.
0525951652|2.0|This concentrated too much on warfare and not enough on the characters.  I did not order second in series - love ken follett but not this time.
B007THA4FI|4.0|It's a well written novel.  The characters are all a bit depressing.  No one seems to be content or even happy but it still held my interest to the end.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|The ending was rushed and in my opinion unresolved.  I was so disappointed after waiting so long for this book to be released!  I kept turning the last page looking for more.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|a great series, well translated, written in a format that is easy to read and with a story that hooks the reader
B001NA6096|4.0|It is a sweet story of two twenty somethings who are still on a journey of finding their way through life, and happen to find each other on the way.  They share with each other their thoughts and history the way you only do with someone that you don't know and don't anticipate seeing again.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Very well written and researched. The characters came to life. A very interesting topic.
B00AFEY354|5.0|You'll laugh, cry, & come out feeling infinite. A cinema masterpiece. Worthy of every award a film can recieve and more.
B008D30K7E|4.0|it was very unusual and i like books set in the northern<br />countries. it is nice to think age is no barrier.
B008OOYALE|2.0|I used to like this game a lot. It used to be fun to me. But not so much now. Apparently there are now problems playing this game with kindle. I have a kindle. There a lot that you can't do using the kindle. I didn't mind so much in the beginning. Now I can't any new dragons unless I buy them using my gold bars. I don't get that much gold bars from my neighbors. So unless I use real money to pay for gold bars then I get new dragons. That isn't fun. They need to fix whatever error they have with the kindle or just not offer to play on the kindle any more.<br /> I even went back to change my review to vent out my frustration on this.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I played all day long and all night long it's so fun.<br />It's so fun that a punched my roommate in the face from playing it on my Kendal fire.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|How could Avatar be matched or outdone...no way. I understand there is a sequal in the works already and if I were the movie producer I'd be nervous. Its worth the price of purchasing the hardware to just to see it...well almost. We have a VIZIO 651 and Sony 790 and are very happy with the purchase.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is such a great family movie. I love having movies available that i can watch with my husband, my 9 year old and my toddler.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|It's like Star Wars and Game of Thrones combined! Definitely many current sci fi and fantasy writers owe Herbert a lot of their inspiration. The great is that he created a hole mythology in a distant future but with issues from any time and some hints of feudalism, plus some mind habilities that rely on pure logic. The ingredients for a classic...
0307949508|5.0|The book is well worth the money,  the writer does a great job with details, but moves quickly between the many plot lines,  Should read the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo first.  If you read first do not get bored with the first 250 pages that sets up the next 400 pages and the next two books.  I was told before I read the first book that first 250 pages would be that way, but was well worth it.  I loved both book and presently in middle of third book, The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Next.  It is great also.  You have to read these books.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great game keeps you wanting more and more on every new level...<br />Totaly kool for travelling long distance...<br />Great app price should drop though..
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|I feel like the writers/producers- just threw everything good, they could think of from any show or movie- up against a wall to see if it would stick.<br /><br />Very little, if any originality. VERY little real life.<br /><br />Even Kevin Bacon, looks lost in this show. Certainly cannot seeing it winning any awards. Too bad.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Fast shipment and good packing.<br />Product as described and it works really well and I have been using my new headset more often due to this re-charging station.
6305882592|4.0|Let the buyer beware. If you are purchasing this partly because it is a Criterion Collection dvd, it is not. I don't know why it's listing is connected with that information. I was expecting Criterion quality extras and there was nothing but a trailer. Great movie, though!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun game that won't take over your life but will still keep you entertained during still moments. I love my dinos.
B0010X8NF0|3.0|Enjoyable Wes Anderson film but this is not a Criterion Collection dvd. I know at least one of his films HAS been released in a Criterion edition, THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS. However, this item is just a regular release version with a few extras. I don't know why it comes up in any Amazon movie search for \\"Criterion Collection\\". So, let the buyer be aware.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Great look at the whole industrial impact on America's need to put food on the table- cheaply and quickly. Fascinating discussion of the various industries- grain, pork , chicken etc.  Very intimidating practices revealed by the huge corporations that control what we eat.  Very enlightening or cause for thought...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Quality tv!! Love the PBS series - they are almost always very good tv. More people should watch PBS tv.
1449410243|5.0|Brought as a Gift for my friend cant get over the awesome humor. I got it after also buying THe Oatmeal, Guidelines to punching a Doliphin.
B002RI9TB4|5.0|From the beginning I was drawn in to this story.  Adichie created characters with such depth and warmth that they soon felt like friends.  The slow downward spiral of the Biafran war was as believable as it was painful.  Her love and feel for words is clear and such a pleasure to read.  I've been on an African &#34;run&#34; as far as my reading since the past couple of months, and I'd decided that after &#34;Half of a Yellow Sun&#34; I'd &#34;change continents.&#34;  However, &#34;Half of a Yellow Sun&#34; left such a mark on me that I couldn't resist ordering and diving into &#34;Purple Hibiscus&#34; which is continuing my respect for Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's ART.
030758836X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! I was captivated immediately.The characters are very compelling... It was difficult to decide whether I sympathized with a character or despised them... And I am not talking about just one character!  All of the characters were multi-dimensional. Amy's insights into women were especially compelling.  I found myself thinking, &#34;Am I like that? Do I do that? Do I behave that way?&#34;  Gillian Flynn is a brilliant writer... She keeps you guessing throughout the book...  My mind was literally spinning! I love this book!!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend and I thoroughly enjoyed this inspirational story.  There is a Harold Fry in all of us, I think.  I recommend the book.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|has been a source of lots of fun, can;t always get folks together for a game so this takes the place pretty well!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book. The story of a girl who come to know love and belonging.  And I learned about the meaning of so many flowers; this was an added bonus.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|Shiping and packing was great.  The CD itself, was just okay for me.  I love JT but this was thrown together.  Suit and tie was the best song.  It was like he was trying capturing his inner &#34;Robin Thicke&#34;.  The lyrics were wack.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The second season continues to impress with superb acting and story telling. In some ways the video is easier to follow than the books were without losing the story line.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent account of this national hero!!<br />You can't set the book down.<br />Encourage everyone to read and then tell all their friends about it.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. I like Tommy Lee Jones. I also enjoyed seeing the scenery that was shown in Louisianna.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved it from page one. It is well worth the read and can not wait to read more. Bring on more please!
B000IFQLLY|4.0|I bought this CD for my step son who is the biggest Depeche Mode fan that there is ! We were moving to our new winter home in Arizona from Minnesota in November and I ordered this about three weeks before we were leaving and I ordered two day delivery and paid for two day delivery, it never came and then my daughter who was living nearby and keeping an eye on the house until it sells, finally called me and told me it showed up after christmas ! Very, Very disappointed, I was giving it to my stepson for christmas. This has happened two years ago at christmas when I ordered a X Box game for my grandson and ordered it on Dec. 18 and paid for two day delivery and on christmas eve, I got an emal that it was on back order and would come after christmas ! Very upsetting,  luckily Best Buy had it and we got it there. So, I am leary about ordering things on Amazon when I want it by a certain date, otherwise, no problems.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|wonderful story and beautifully acted.  I would recommend to any Audry Hepburn fan.  Not a tear jerker, which is great.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|My brother loves this series. He was very happy to get it for Christmas. I am late writing a review - I apologize for that. But I highly recommend this seller to anyone!
B002SAS26E|5.0|I'm always on the lookout for good two-player games to play with my partner, and Jaipur has quickly become one of our favorites. The rules are pretty straightforward, and don't take long to know forward and backward; however, there is plenty of strategy to keep things interesting. It has good re-play appeal in my opinion.<br /><br />I also like that this is a pretty short game--it usually takes 30-45 minutes to play a game, which is enough to unwind and enjoy a cocktail. It's not the kind of game you have to clear your whole evening's schedule for.<br /><br />The art on the cards is lovely, and they appear to be pretty well made, though I'm not sure how durable the cards are, so we've been pretty gentle.
B00BUI6D2A|3.0|The album is cool. I miss the old Wayne from the squad up days. Check this out [[ASIN:B00A17CSLQ Girls Gone Wild (feat. D.U.B.)]]
B0050PYNO4|5.0|I watched Paul from a friend's laptop and thought the movie was a riot!  As soon as I got back to my computer, I placed an order.  the two disc version is ideal because I know my son will want a copy after he's sees this movie.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|I found this book to be highly entertaining.  The characters are well fleshed out and I could hear the dialogue in my head as I read along.  All in all, a good read.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Big Bang Theory is a hilarious show!!  All seasons are so funny!  You should buy the whole series now and be prepared to laugh!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love picsart it is so cool. I can get followers. I can post pica or creat pic cologes. I think you should get it!!!!
B003QTSMXE|5.0|I loved this movie!! though it's pretty scary that without some major changes this is exactly what our world could become.. :(
B009JZWWGC|3.0|The Story Line:<br />Captain Kirk and his crew must deal with Mr. Spock's half brother who hijacks the Enterprise for an obsessive search for God.<br /><br />The story moves OK through some hostage crisis situation, the usual away team missions from the Enterprise and then a journey what the center of the galaxy where the Enterprise team meets a supreme being. It has some would-be spiritual elements and some back story for Mccoy and Spock along the way but it lacks some of the entertainment you get accustomed to from this series.<br /><br />Still worth a second watch if you have not seen it in a while but only if you have the time to spare, don't break your day in half to fit this in your schedule.
1400052181|5.0|Skloot thoroughly investigates the history of both Henrietta Lacks' life and the history of HeLa cells.  She expertly weaves Henrietta and the Lacks family's personal narrative with the scientific timeline of the HeLa cells, while making the science simple and easy to understand. It also called into question the right to claim ownership over things that leave your body, such as DNA or cancerous cells, which sparked many debates among my peers. It was thoughtful, engaging, and left a lasting impression on my mind, and encouraged me to educate others on the origins and story behind HeLa.
B009JZY3B4|4.0|The story line:<br />On the eve of retirement, Kirk and McCoy are charged with assassinating the Klingon High Chancellor and imprisoned. The Enterprise crew must help them escape to thwart a conspiracy aimed at sabotaging the last best hope for peace.<br /><br />What's not on the box cover:<br />The added humor between Kirk and Mccoy, makes even the lack-luster scenes a bit entertaining.<br /><br />These are great movies to go back and watch a second time and it's always interesting to see how writers and directors try to create a science fiction future including what they think technology will be like. I find myself paying closer attention to how the Enterprise bridge gets built and upgraded throughout the series.<br /><br />Fun to watch and always worth a second look.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I always have 3 or 4 different bags I had to carry around because I couldn't find a bag big enough or practical for all my equipment. This is great! The only gripe I do have is the clips that hold your tripod are almost impossible to open. but that is easily fixed with a hammer.lol
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This is one of the most brilliantly put together games.May we have many more years with this well thought out video game.Absolutely overwhelming and absurdly comical game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|SUPPER COOL TO PLAY BUT IT JUST NEEDS THE NETHER AND SOME ENDERMEN BUT IT'S THE BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I didn't enjoy this as much as I wanted to.  I love Tina Fey & will definitely read anything she writes in future, however.
B008JFLWLE|4.0|I program for my grandchildren. It is good for beginner studying their math skills. I have used it also. good job
B00BK5D95C|4.0|I would say alt-J is not for everyone, but for those who like it, there's a lot to like. The vocal arrangements for the pieces are beautiful. Songs that I enjoy: Taro, Breezeblocks, & Fitzpleasure (especially for guitar practice).
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Really enjoyed it, very easy to get sucked into. At times I could find myself wasting a few hours reading it.
B004DNWPY4|3.0|This was a very interesting book about how people with a worth of a million or more acheived that distinction.  I thought there were too many graphs and comparable numbers and percentages.  It has made me take a better look at my finances and how I spend my money.  It is not rocket science but common sense.  If you spend all your money and don't save, you will have nothing in the end. Sounds like a simple concept and it is.  This book is more of a reminder then a breakthrough concept.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Easy enough to play. It would be nice if the game was explained a bit Moore. You pretty much have to figure it out by playing.
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|Nice movie, but a bit over the top. Visuals (3D) are very good, but not impressive. Also, it really gets predictable and boring at times.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Movie was just ok - not seeing all the hype with kids killing kids, especially with what's going on in the schools
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|When my four year old sits quietly through a full length feature...I KNOW that is a great  movie! Very well done and the story flowed effortlessly. All the right heartstrings got pulled.
B009P0ZUJW|5.0|This is an excellent recording!  The selections of composers are great and Helene Grimaud has never been better.  Excellent chamber music.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Such an uplifting story. I loved it and highly.recommend it to anyone who has ever been in love, and and to mothers.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|I had to watch the movie for an assignment fora college course but really enjoyed the movie.watch it with a friend.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|I think this is one of QT's best so far (I haven't seen D'jango yet) can't wait to sit down and watch this again.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I got the book about 3 days before Chris was murdered, it put a  different perspective on the whole read
B000W93CXQ|5.0|This book really got me to think. I'm going to recommend it to my younger sister who I think would really get something from it.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|This is a good first album for sure.  I can see why it was a hit a few years back.  Good timing. but pretty simple.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|written by a harvard professor in neurology when she realizes she's getting alzheimers.<br />that happened suddenly about some blocks away of her conference and it opens the door of discoveries about herself and how to get diagnosed. fabulous reading
B008JDAC7G|3.0|This is a fun game from adultswim games, but the super version allows for more challenging play, power ups, and level ups.  It would be great if Super Monsters Ate My Condo was supported by kindle.  Is there anything someone can do about that?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I'm a kid but I found myself laughing hysterically laughing and I actually burst out crying in the middle of  T.J max. Truly wondrous book
B008B1VYP0|5.0|this album really rocks! i enjoy listening to it over and over! my grandsons love dancing to it! i play it at work all the time
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|When I herd the first tract I was stunned. I thought if the rest of the album is like this we have one of the best Jimi Hendrix album ever recorded. In my opinion this is one of the best. I loved his distortion and feed back in the 60's. I'm glad we get to here jimi at his best no gimmicks.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My son loved it. It was one of those movies he watched from start to finish and more than once.
B00B23O96A|3.0|I like the album. As I listen to it more I start to like it more.This isn't the first album That I had to give myself time to appreciate what he was doing.I'm open to new styles or I should say old styles.<br /> There are a few songs that I would expect from Eric. I have enjoyed his music from the beginning and was never disappointed  at a live show.He is the the greatest guitar player of all time no one will ever be better.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|The movie was fine, but in stereo because you all don't have an app that supports Dolby Digital 5.1 for Panasonic. I will never stream another movie from you all. I paid $4.99 for the High Definition version of this movie. $3.00 more and I would have covered the price of the Netflix monthly streaming fee. This was a total waste of money.
B000JML90Y|5.0|It's kinda short, but a very informative read. I definitely recommend all of Darwin's works. I will be getting more in the future.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I liked it a lot. Can't wait for the next one! Now what am I going to read?! Any suggestions?
0783231202|5.0|Leave it ti Spielberg to make a good story even better especially when it is American history, full of insight.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|I really like the CD, there are a few &#34;bluegrass&#34; inspired songs and some dance inspired songs that I can either &#34;take it or leave it&#34; but all the other songs are great.The CD to me is well worth the 7-8 songs I really like. Justin has not skipped a beat in the quality of his songs.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|this app is awesome it does so many things that are just awesome. so get this app if you need a great alarm clock to wake you.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love to download music video. Quick and easy. You and an also download mp3s. Quick an<br />d easy. Great app for everyone
B00AZM7IQC|4.0|Very simple story line, no dialog.......however, being a HUGE Cirque fan, having seen several shows, this movie is an amazing 3d visual wonder.....Extraordinary camera work.
B008R65Y28|5.0|I was online searching for Fear and Loathing. I found this combo pack for about the same price as Fear and Loathing by itself. I had seen all these movies before and I like them all. Johnny Depp is the best! Cry Baby is somewhat similar to Grease, I suppose, only darker and much more entertaining to me. Public Enemies is a great drama with a lot of action about John Dillinger and his gang. Fear and Loathing is based on the book by Hunter S. Thompson. It is basically one long, very humorous acid trip. These movies should be added to any Johnny Depp fan's collection. :D
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Everyone who is interested in the workings of our government should read this book.  The President's Club may be the most exclusive gathering in the world, open only to past presidents of the United States.  This is where man meets man, where all members work to strengthen and support the current president, leaving party politics aside.  Past presidents have, and will, contribute to and  influence present White House positions.  The book is not only informative; it's also a great read.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Shipped on time, quality is great and everything is in order.  Will be looking forward to buying season 3.  Great.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|What sort of job should you seekk?  You know your weaknesses -- Strength Finder helps you discover where you shine.  You'll find yourself passing this book around to your friends.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|not worth all the hype.  Would have made an OK 90 minute TV movie.  will not purchase the next two.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|The movie was basically good. The sound track was strange and the spilling of blood was over the top. Jamie Foxx was excellent! I liked the character of the German bounty hunter.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I was playing a chess app on my IPod touch called chess with friends.  The unfortunate thing is people don't seem to want to play chess.  This App is great I get to play against the computer and there are many different levels.  I am learning along the way as well.  If you are an avid player you will definitely enjoy this app.
B002NOAF9W|5.0|This is great, no doubt.  It's just to bad they didn't do the extra disc with the correct sequence and the left out verse of Sympathy.  It also would have been nice to hear the live version of Gimme Shelter that closed the Maysles film of the tour.
B0079L2XTE|5.0|I had no idea there were subtitles when I viewed the movie, but the story and audio tracks more than made up for it.  The various tracks are an odd mix, but the ones by Enaudi are so outstanding, it is well worth the investment.
B005N95JA4|5.0|The bonus disc is the best album the band has put out since Tatoo You! They could have released it as a seperate album.  How good would that have been.  Accidents will happen Claudine!

B0054R6BFM|5.0|this book is hard to read because it deals with some really serious stuff and makes you want to cry. i'm 16 going on 17 and loved the book, but don't recommend the book to much younger or immature readers.<br /><br />i noticed two recurring themes in the negative reviews, and would like to defend the author and book. the themes: 1) hannah is whiny and silly; she's not serious enough for someone commiting suicide. 2) her reasons are small, everyday high school occurences, and if they were such a big deal, it's her fault for not seeking help.<br /><br />you can't really understand hannah unless you understand depression. depression is hard to understand unless you're actually dealing with it. one of the most important things to know is that there are many forms of depression, including SAD, bipolar disorder, cyclothemia, and major depression. i recommend reading up on them, even if you don't think they affect you in anyway.<br /><br />i wouldn't say hannah is silly or whiny. she's nervous. she's scared. she's given up. she's trying to reassure herself that she's making the right choice. she's hurting, and she needs someone, anyone, to blame. in part , she blames herself, though she doesn't say it outright- that's why she kills herself; not because she's selfish. and she needs someone to listen- that's why, at the end of the tape, she thanks the same people she was blaming!<br /><br />yes, she needed help. yes, she should have asked for it instead of turning it away. but when your depressed, asking for help is nearly impossible. you want to, but can't get the words out. you may drop hints, but you don't really trust anyone. when people start noticing the hints, you panic. it feels like they're accusing you of something, you automatically deny it. even when you're on the verge, of suicide, you tell yourself you don't need help.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT* our country has sadly deteriorated morally if they think the things hannah dealt with were small or normal: boys Touched her innaproprately and without her consent; a peeping tom took pictures of her getting dressed; she saw a classmate raped while drunk; her intoxicated friend drove into a stop sign, later resulting in a young man's death. these are all traumatizing experiences in and of themselves!<br /><br />neither mr. asher nor i are trying to commend or recommend suicide. we know it is not a solution. we are merely trying to explain what leads people to suicide. the hope is that this book will help those considering suicide to reconsider or seek help, and that others will more clearly recognize the signs and actively reach out to help the depressed. this book is a marvelous work with purpose and meaning.

This book puts everything together with a beautifully designed manner of the evolution of human being as it can be summarized in its topic : your inner fish. I love the book and recommend to everybody who has a bit of cruosity to our journey in the history of earth.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This was a Kindle freebie, and I'm so glad it was because otherwise I would probably never have read it. Haynes is a welcome addition to the genre of Sophie Hannah and Nicci French, both of which have dissappointed me lately with their new books. This is a psychological thriller of abuse, told from a viewpoint of a young woman starting over after an abusive relationship. I liked the gripipng story and tensions the author was able to build, and the fact that the plot didn't have implausible turns.

B00479SVBU|3.0|I also did not want to replace my Factory CD/Radio system. So I decided to buy a Wireless MP3 Player with micro SD Ram reading capability.<br />I did a research and noticed this car transmitter has all the options I need. It has SD Ram reading capability up to 32GB capacity, shows you the song details on a clear Display and also has song shuffle capability.<br />I installed a 32GB class 10 micro SD ram in the SD adapter and after I copied all my MP3 songs (Nearly 2750) I inserted this into this MP3 player.<br />It immediately recognized all the 2750 songs and began playing at the frequency which I set it to. It showed the title and artist correctly on the small display. Song Shuffle works great too.<br />It is easy to work with. The remote control is also very nice to have. Worth mentioning is that this MP3 player also has a separate USB input that you can use.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Noticed that this device doesn't actualy have a shuffle function.<br />In the Shuffle mode, it just plays a collection which it decided on itself as random.. over and over again..<br />So if you have a collection of (let's say) 1000... you will only hear 12 songs of these 1000.... over and over again...<br /><br />I find it a shame that the manufacturer doesn't mention this shuffle related fact. Let's be honest... this is one of the main reason of having a car mp3 player.<br />This is the reason why I lowered the rating from 5 to 3.<br />I am looking now for a car MP3 player that doesn't have this problem....<br />If anyone has a good experience with a car MP3 player that has trully shuffle capabilities... I would be more than happy to hear from you.

B000J4QWMC|1.0|For the record, I have never seen the original \\"Miami Vice\\" TV show, since I was a very small child when it originally came out.<br /><br />So be assured that the movie adaptation of \\"Miami Vice\\" -- produced, directed and written by the series' producer Michael Mann -- does not induce fan-rage in me. It fails not as an adaptation, but as an interesting movie. It's an astoundingly realistic and gritty movie, but it also has almost no tension or excitement... and it piles on a truckload of Hollywood cliches.<br /><br />While pursuing a pimp at a Miami nightclub, \\"Sonny\\" Crockett ( Colin Farrell) and \\"Rico\\" Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) are called out by an informant who has been working for the FBI. The guy commits suicide when he discovers that a Colombian cartel has murdered his wife, but not before he reveals that somebody compromised him.<br /><br />With the blessing of FBI Special Agent John Fujima (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds), Sonny and Rico pose as drug smugglers who offer their services to Jose Yero (John Ortiz) and the kingpin Archangel de Jesus Montoya (Luis Tosar). Sonny starts to fall in love with Isabella (Gong Li), Montoya's girlfriend/financial advisor, but it doesn't take long for everything to go belly-up for the Miami Vice partners.<br /><br />The problem with \\"Miami Vice\\" can be summed up in three words: it is BORING. There are long stretches where absolutely nothing seems to be happening, which Mann tries to fill up with an awkward Sonny/Isabella romance and lots of talking about things that MIGHT happen. In fact, the romance completely derails the whole drug-smuggling plot for awhile.<br /><br />I'm sure actual vice cops have long stretches of tedium in their jobs, so in that regard the movie does feel very \\"real.\\" But it doesn't make for compelling cinema if the first eighty percent of your movie is devoid of tension or action -- and some rockin' soundtrack choices do not inject the much-needed excitement into these scenes.<br /><br />Admittedly this movie is very grittily realistic, with lots of shakycam and grimy, murky standoffs, as if you had followed the cops into their confrontations with a video camera. But that sense of realism is totally undermined by a bunch of Hollywood staples -- the love interest in peril, the forbidden romance with the villain's mistress, the random explosions, and so on. It just snaps you out of the experience.<br /><br />Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are actually pretty decent in their roles. But they both look sort of confused and underwhelmed, and for some reason Farrell often sounds like he's trying to channel Christian Bale's Batman voice. As for Gong Li, she is bafflingly miscast -- I don't really know why a Chinese actress (with a thick accent) was cast as a Cuban.<br /><br />\\"Miami Vice\\" aims for a gritty, realistic approach, but the Hollywood tropes and total lack of tension leave it a pale, lifeless mess. Even Foxx and Farrell can't save this.ily realistic, with lots of shakycam and grimy, murky standoffs, as if you had followed the cops into their confrontations with a video camera.

B005S9ELVC|3.0|Los Angeles, 1949. Mobster Mickey Cohen has become the most powerful California mobster, and intends to continue spreading his influence.<br /><br />Of course, there are a few uncorrupted cops who don't intend to let him do that, even if they have to step outside the law. And so we get \\"Gangster Squad,\\" which has a dream cast and a stylish noirish look, but also fails to really impress with storytelling or character development. It's not dreadful, but it's not as good as it should be.<br /><br />Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) rules the Los Angeles underworld, with the help of corrupt cops and judges. After saving a girl from some of Cohen's thugs, Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is called in by the police chief with a very special mission: destroy Cohen's criminal empire, and send him packing from LA. O'Mara's pregnant wife Connie (Mireille Enos) isn't pleased by this.<br /><br />With Connie's help, O'Mara quickly assembles his \\"gangster squad\\" -- a strong street detective (Anthony Mackie), a wire-tapper (Giovanni Ribisi), a gunslinger who targets gangsters (Robert Patrick) and his partner (Michael Pe&ntilde;a). They're also joined by Wootens (Ryan Gosling), who is having a clandestine affair with Cohen's mistress/etiquette coach Grace Faraday (Emma Stone).<br /><br />And after a little training, the Gangster Squad begins taking down Cohen's empire -- they attack casinos, kill Cohen's men, and basically wreck all his business. But when Cohen deduces who they are and what they're doing, he decides to strike back.<br /><br />\\"Gangster Squad\\" is a decent movie, but it should be a truly brilliant one. It has a talented all-star cast including Penn, Gosling and Brolin, a lot of flashy gangster violence and sleaze, and it's directed by the guy who brought us \\"Zombieland.\\" But somehow... just somehow... it doesn't quite gel as a film.<br /><br />Ruben Fleischer gives postwar L.A. a pulpy, glitzy look that grows more gritty and rough as the film unwinds. He also seems to be having a lot of fun with all the blasting guns, burning money and dramatic death scenes, such as when one man is thrown in a pool and shot.<br /><br />But there isn't really anything memorable during the scenes of vigilante justice. The squad just bursts in and blast away unnamed mooks, then moves on to the next target. Some parts are so painfully Hollywood that it burns -- consider the ditchwater-dull relationship between Wootens and Grace, which seems to just be in the movie because we needed a romance between two hot young people.<br /><br />The movie also tries to bring up the moral aspect of vigilantism (Keeler says that they're no different from Cohen) but immediately drops it without saying yea or nay. Seriously, don't do that. It just makes the story seem shallow.<br /><br />Fortunately, this is somewhat compensated for by the awesome casting. Sean Penn is all wiry sneering and snarling as Mickey Cohen, a sadistic thug who believes it's his \\"destiny\\" to rule the western US. Penn is not in the movie very often, but he brings an electric energy to whatever scenes he is in.<br /><br />Brolin is also excellent as a soldier-turned-cop who hasn't quite lost his urge to fight for what he believes in, and who wants to expunge the corruption from the City of Angels. Ryan Gosling does a passable job, even though his whole role is basically to romance Stone. And while the rest of the cast isn't fleshed out as much, we get some excellent low-key performances from Mackie, Patrick, Nick Nolte, Enos and Ribisi.<br /><br />\\"Gangster Squad\\" should really be a much better movie than it is, but the solid acting from a great cast keeps it afloat.

B00C1BU7V8|2.0|The best parts of the picture were the sets and Tommy Lee Jones.  Other than that, it wasn't all that great.  For example, we see the Lincoln's upset over their son's desire to enlist.  However, the son's character is never really developed.  We viewers don't really care what he does, or if he lives or dies.  Also, Lincoln's dialog frequently uses big words like \\"extemporaneous\\" and then he also uses the word, \\"ain't\\".  Who wrote this dialog?  I just couldn't connect.  The lack of connection may be because there was too much story \\"telling\\" and not enough story \\"showing\\".  We are told that the amendment passed, in part, because of underhanded practices.  What we see are a couple of silly guys milling about who are supposed to sway people.  It's only at one point that we see a legislator even get a hairy eyeball of pressure.  The mayhem in the legislative debates is just ridiculous. Robert's Rules of Order came from how the legislature conducted itself in debate.  I have also served 4 terms in a state legislature.  If people behaved as the director, in his worst film ever, depicted them, they would be removed from the chamber.  It's just not even closely historically accurate. For me the legislative scenes might as well be a cartoon. Aside from a few facial expressions from the darker skinned members of the cast, there is no character development there either.  (Which I really would have liked to have seen as the subject of the movie was Lincoln's handling abolition)  It would seem that with all of characters, the director chose to be skimpy on development and dialog (except with Lincoln) in a way that made their words economical but charicature-like.  He tried to make important points using people we never got to know. So their statements do not carry the import that they could.  This is no Schindler's List.  I cried for a week after seeing Schindler's List.  I've already forgotten most of Lincoln.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I read this book after having it recommended to me by multiple people, and ended up feeling pretty disappointed in it.  It was written okay, and I did (mostly) want to find out what happened to the main characters.  But I was told it was like &#34;Twilight for intelligent people,&#34; but mostly it was just like Twilight.  Yes, the main female character is a 30-something with a doctorate, but she still spends most of her time mooning of the tall, dark, rich and handsome vampire.  There was also a really huge sexist streak in the book, with the men doing stuff (planning wars, saving women) while the women sat around and talked and made sandwiches (and got rescued).  A couple other more minor issues I had with the book were (1) the vampire housekeeper--if you're a super-powerful immortal, why are you spending eternity cleaning someone else's house?  And (2) why are we all okay with the tall dark and handsome vampire killing a woman for giving his sweetheart a threatening picture?  That's the sort of thing bad guys do, not good guys.  Why doesn't he go after the woman who tortured his sweetheart instead?

However, the two Velcro dividers used to suspend the camera above the bottom of the case were missing in the order I received. I contacted Amazon Customer Service and requested that they send me the missing items, but apparently that is contrary to their policies: They can only send me a whole new case, and I have to return the one I received. This is an inconvenience, albeit not a major one. In my opinion, both Amazon's quality control and its replacement policies are less than optimal when it comes to this item.

B002O5M4SA|5.0|Even if you never got to see the original theatrical release, I have to say this is something you may want to really sink your teeth into. Leon, a professional assassin, saves the life of Matilda and takes her in and begins to care for her. While their relationship can be seen as father / daughter relationship at the start, you can slowly see it morph into something much more. Many of the additional scenes in this version were taken out of the theatrical release simply because the studio didn't think an American audience could swallow the relationship that Leon and Matilda develop over the course of the film. Whereas the original does show them growing closer as the film progresses, this version digs even deeper. It shows how deeply flawed Matilda is and eventually reveals how broken she's become. It also shows why she begins to feel the way she does for Leon and how he deals with it in such a lovely way. I do not want to spoil too much of the additional footage, but if you cannot keep an open mind while watching this film, perhaps you should just skip it.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the original release, but this version goes beyond anything I could have hoped for. It shows how broken a person becomes after extreme abuse and trauma and how much of an angel Leon becomes in his protection of Matilda. Their relationship is both scary and dysfunctional, but still quite beautiful.<br /><br />4.8 / 5
0143118757|3.0|i was asked to order it for one of my business partners, I didn't read it myself, can't really rate it
B000PHX4VA|5.0|because the police had great songs to listen to it so sad  that they broke up in the short time that they played togather
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Wonderful.  Beautiful voice.  It has become a CD that I listen to constantly.  I may be one of the few persons in the world that didn't know she was the daughter of Ravi Shankar.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|This was a very gentle and sweet movie about loss (loss of life, loss of love) and finding someone who fits perfectly. A lovely story.  The two leads shone in this film.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I loved the way they handled this pre-ordered DVD... kept lowering the price as the price lowered on the site.  After shipment Amazon even credited my account for $1.00 making the price even better. I will do this pre-ordering before release date again. Lincoln is a great movie. It starts out kinda slow with the usual scenes from the Congress BUT it really picks up and is a great story. We really enjoyed it.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|For young guys who like that sort of thing, I'm sure the interminable battle scenes were terrific, but I would have liked to have seen more balance.  By the end of the movie, I still knew the names of only 4 of the dwarves--a bit more time spent on the characters would have been appreciated rather than the goblin scene and the later orc scene going on a bit too long.  I loved the riddle scene between Bilbo & Gollum and found the movie entertaining, but I missed having subtitles on the digital rental--I probably missed the dialogue in 1/3 of the movie, including some of the riddles. :-(<br /><br />Loved Radagast the Brown, loved the elves, loved seeing Frodo...<br /><br />...but I wish they had used available technology to de-age all of the characters we've seen before--it's possible (the Tron sequel, even NCIS has used it successfully), and with the budget these movies have?  There was no need for Frodo, older Bilbo, and Galadriel to look so different.  Even Bilbo's hair was different.  Only Hugo Weaving looked nearly the same.  (With Frodo, it wasn't only the face--although they did get the wig right!--it was the fact that the actor went from being a very young man to a man in his prime in the interim 10 years--the shoulders/carriage were completely different.)  These are nitpicky things--but Peter Jackson has showed himself to be a director who pays incredible attention to detail generally.<br /><br />In many ways, Jackson has taken a book I always found the least interesting of the Middle Earth volumes, and turned it into a delightful, fun story that comes alive.  But I really was getting restless and ready to move on by the end of the two main battle scenes.  And I'm skeptical that one short book can be stretched into 3 films, no matter how much of the Silmarillion and the appendices he pulls into the mix (much as I love the inclusion of these).  If this movie is anything to go by, my skepticism may be justified.
0385536828|5.0|Even thought this is not a cold war spy vs. spy espionage type novel, it rates 5 stars because of the manner in which master author McEwan converts what could be a predictable  love story into an entirely different genre.<br /><br />First some background. The novel takes place in Great Britain in 1972-73, a time of social, economic and political turmoil. People must cope with shortages, a devastating coal miners' strike, rationing, a sense of decline and malaise, and, of course, the terrorism from Northern Ireland. It would be reasonable for the intelligence agencies to believe British democracy is threatened, especially when it was fashionable among certain academics to overlook Stalin's atrocities and embrace communism. Hence a low level M15 ploy to influence public opinion by enlisting sympathetic authors. The love story follows.<br /><br />With that said, three key elements of the book are responsible for its appeal and rating.<br />First, Sweet Tooth is written by a male author but narrated in the first person voice of a female main character, Serena Plume. That's significant. Second, the general plot line is summarized in the first few sentences of the book, so you know it's not going to end well, at least in the traditional sense. So why keep reading? You should, because a major twist at the end reconciles the first two elements, leaving you stunned, and adds additional insight and complexity to what could have merely been a well written love story set against a low level cold war maneuver. Clever, clever, clever.<br /><br />Of course the prose shines with well crafted literary quality sentences that offer insightful observations of human emotions and personal relationships. McEwan is a gifted author.

B00B2166BS|5.0|I love the Nexus 10, but it can take a while to charge with the included USB charger. I don't have specs or even timing of charges, but I can definitely say that charging is noticeably faster with this pogo cable. I can't say exactly how much faster, but just based on my experience, with the USB charger, I would often go back to my Nexus 10 after a few hours, expect it to be charged, and see it still at around 80% or so. That has not happened with this charger. I would guesstimate that it charges 20%, 25% faster than the USB cable--enough that if your Nexus 10 is running very low in the early evening, you can use this pogo charger and expect it to be charged later in the evening (that wasn't the case for me with the USB charger).<br /><br />The magnetic grips are a nice touch. One more nice detail: if your Nexus 10 is turned off and you attach the pogo cable, you feel a short vibration like when you turn it on. That lets you know the pogo cable is attached correctly. I charge my Nexus 10 on a desktop, with the cable hanging down, and I don't have to worry about anything pulling on the cable--enough force, and the pogo cable will detach (but don't think for a second that it will just pop off; it absolutely won't). It apparently also has a built-in guard to prevent overcharging, and the overall build quality is great. This little charger sits on the magnetic pogo charge port and cradles the side of the Nexus 10. It may be a third-party product, but you would never know it: it fits perfectly and is high quality.<br /><br />The packaging is a nice touch: it comes in a small light cloth bag, with a plastic cap over the rare earth charging head.

B003UESJHE|5.0|Great movie, great performances. This is one of those films that truly lives up to its critical acclaim. The BD picture and sound is state of the art.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00BJS7LHC|1.0|His film making may have been unique when Kill Bill was released but it's lost it's impact.  It's not new now...just a long and boring film that I couldn't wait for to end.  Nothing happened in this movie-I think he's lost it-
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|For as many times as I've seen the Indiana Jones movies, I never owned them on DVD, save for &#34;Crystal Skull&#34; (which I didn't bother catching in the theater).<br /><br />Saw this 4-movie set at amazon at a very attractive price and purchased it as a Xmas gift for the whole family. Nice to have it all in one place and on BluRay.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|The wife and I were looking for something to watch that would fall under our Prime membership and decided on Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol.  We didn't go into it with high hopes but we ended up enjoying it.  The plot is thin, but I don't really watch these movies for the plot.  It's a great short escape with high powered action scenes.  Worth one watch, but I will most likely never see it again.
B005I3PAUO|4.0|Not like &#34;The camel Club&#34; series or the &#34;King and Maxwell&#34; books, buit a real Baldacci and an excellent read.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Great script; wonderful acting; I totally recommend this movie if you like period dramas! Based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Number three in the chronicles, and a grippinmg sequel to the previous two. Loved it, a must and not only for Archer fans.
B000SEI230|5.0|Recommend for anyone that wants to read a sweet but sometimes sad book. Makes you feel good. Highly recommend the book.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|If you enjoyed any of the previous American Pie movies, you will definitely love American Reunion.  Reunion makes a tremendous amount of references to the previous movies, so I would highly recommend checking them out first.  If you are in the mood for some laid-back, silly comedy, definitely check this out!
B0041VT6HW|4.0|Good movie. Great actors and actresses. Although the story line lacked a little, it was an overall good movie. Would recommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My son loves this game, plays it all the time.  I have not played it so I have no comment.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book by Jodi Picoult is a thriller of an unusual genre. It highlights human behavior across a significant part of the lives of two children, their families and community. Jodi has profound insight into various female and male reactions and responses to events, and plays that through in a breathtaking manner. Captivating up to the final page!<br />Am now reading The Storyteller by the same author and it is another must read!
B007XF0X16|3.0|Cool movie but the Blu-ray quality was grainy...not at as Blu-ray is reputed to be.  Disappointing to say the least!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Good story.  Excellent animation.  It is full of arcade nostalgia.  Have watched it over a dozen times already.  I highly recommend it.
0345529057|5.0|You can buy a thrill and watch it on HBO!  Martin's fantasy is a pure cerebral amusement park ride that keeps you in line for more and more and the only disappointment is knowing it's got to end sometime. All the Shakespearian themes with Tolkien like adventure and red blooded characters who are not safe in the serpentine plot that weaves its way through five (count 'em) delicious  hefty servings(there's one more A Dance With Dragons).  Read the books; watch the series.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I think I've probably watched this movie about 30 times since I got it.  I love everything about it.  It's got video game easter eggs for us old timers, and modern references for the youngsters.  But at the end of the day, I think this is about a good message.  There is good in everyone.
B000002GW5|5.0|One of the greatest album put out by Jackson Brown. The CD was in very good shape. Buy it while you still can.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I have been on this for about three weeks and have lost 5 lbs and a couple of inches on waist and hips.  That is what happened with the South Beach Diet.  I never did lose a lot of pounds on it (30) but my clothes got a lot smaller, from a 18/20 to a 14/16 and I was  happy with that at my age.  I thought I would mind the fast days but they are easy knowing that I can eat tomorrow.  It's still too soon to tell but I think it may be the right plan for me as I hate counting calories even tho I know calories count.
B00947N6UG|2.0|I returned it too you twice no and still hav the same problem the add said it comes with 2 free hopping eggs they didn't come with it , why now im going to send back the third one . very dissatisfied don't you people read the reason for return I cant call you due to the fact im deaf

B0027MJU00|2.0|I di not enjoy this book as I thought it was extremely depressing.  I could not recommend this book to anyone.
B004WR125O|5.0|Not much to say except that it worked perfectly with my Onkyo TX-NR717. I was able to access streaming music sources with perfect quality.
B006LSZECO|3.0|If I had not already purchased this book before I read Dark Places, I would not have read it.  I don't necessarily like &#34;fairy tale&#34; endings, but I feel the ending was not complete.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very thoughtful and interesting story. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a deeper understanding of NDE.  I basically read this for a bible study thru our Methodist church and love the spiritual meaning and insight of the authors views.
B003UN409Q|3.0|3 Stars, I still recommend seeing the film. My observation is that it only showed Jim Morrison in the &#34;mostly out of control&#34; events. It would have been a much more satisfying film had the film contained some of the incredible events/things that led to their success. There were 3 other very talented musicians in the group and this film did not give them a relative voice. I am pretty sure that the group got along better and worked very hard at creating what I call one of the best assembly of talent in the music scene at that time, and that still holds true for today. The film lacked the depth I was expecting. It is kind of hard to believe that the Doors recorded 6 albums in basically 4 years while Jim Morrison was out of control the whole time. It would have been nice to see a little more of that creative, or climbing the ladder to success that the Doors collectively came across in that time. The title of the film is not the best title for the film, maybe &#34;The Destruction of Jim Morrison&#34; would have been a better characterization of what I interpreted.... Still the film was very entertaining, well acted and structured well within the Hollywood Movie Machine.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|An entire movie on &#34;The Emancipation Proclamation&#34;? Hard to sit thru it, hard to follow their voices/words and bordering on boring. Sorry, but I think all raves and awards were done by people trying to be &#34;politically correct&#34;.
B004J09ONG|4.0|Wonderful fun movie to watch, kinda like watching your children mature and go off to have their own famly and hope you did the best for them possible.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the whole thing. It brought back good gaming memories from childhood. Great movie to watch and have on your DVD shelf.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very thought provoking movie. Hard to watch this and not change the way you view/approach eating meat. A little scary actually.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|At first, for some reason, I was hesitant to watch this movie, but I went ahead and purchased it, and I have to say that this movie is one of my favorites! Alot of action, blood & gore, and a little comic relief, which for me makes an awesome movie.
B007EDYN36|3.0|Interesting read, I enjoyed most of it. I got the impression some of the stories were embellished a bit to make them more interesting. I enjoyed Ace's book much more.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The saga continues with a shocker ending in Scotland! Those who are already addicted to the series will love it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is definitely one of the best books I've ever read...I've read it 3 times and will probably read it again in the not-too-distant future...
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|El inglés del siglo XVIII - XIX me encantó.  Es un libro romántico, que describe los sentimientos de la naturaleza humana detalladamente.  Tiene un final feliz.
B008220DIC|5.0|After nearly a year of waiting, I was finally able to view this movie(Actually, I purchased it within the first week.)  I knew this movie was going to be something different, and that I would probably be watching it more in time.  Paul Thomas Anderson usually delivers a profound movie experience.  As with any of his movies, you have to expect a certain degree of bewilderment upon initial viewings.  This becomes less evident AFTER REPEATED VIEWINGS.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  It's kind of special when something like this comes along.  Anderson is like the next Kubrick.  His movies were bold and innovative from the get-go, but he gets more mature and refined as his career progresses.  With all due respect to the late/great Mr. Kubrick, Anderson's films simply have more heart.  Characters are not just mouthpieces anymore, but rather the whole instrument.  This is not a perfect film, so don't expect one; However, there is no denying its genius.  Then again, WHAT IS a perfect film?  You decide.  Speaking to you possible first time viewers, just keep an open mind and enjoy the experience(which is only enhanced with time and Blu-ray I might add.)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a bunch of crap. &#34;Please sir&#34; is her reply to everything.  Is she stupid and a masochist?  Ugly book.  How anyone can find this stimulating or interesting is beyond me.  1950's mentality as far as women's rights
1118273052|5.0|Interesting book about how can one be successful in the stock market. Different methods to be successful in the markets
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched the video of the history of &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; and the Countess interviewed gave an account of past history.  I think the attention to historical detail in this series is very admirable. It's a time period that is not given much attention, and it should be.  The characters are well developed and it's the perfect balance of humor, intrigue and drama. I'm loving every minute of it.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|OK, it is a little gruesome, but oh-so-funny!<br /><br />At last the a slaughter-fest movie were we get to see how something like that might actually / probably happen.  Just good-old-boys going fishing...  plus a little paranoia on the part of everyone else.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Wish it were available over 4G on my iPhone, and I wish here at school (a major university) the WiFi were strong enough that it wasn't all fuzzy.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|I love the CD there one or two songs I skip when listen to the CD but as a whole the CD is phenomenal.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Love it, the color is vibrant and my kin dle starts when I open it. it is easy to use as a stand which makes it easier to read at work when I'm on my break.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Slow to download the videos and bogs down to a forced shutdown. Not to shure where to find it but would rather have the real youtube app to us. I just dont like this app to much.

B0083B3KOQ|4.0|Finally, I can read free epub books from the library on my Kindle Fire! Love this app--so easy to use &amp; fast. My only complaint is it doesn't rotate with my screen. This is one of the BEST apps I've ever bought.

B0052CK5PQ|4.0|Caitin explores what it means to be a feminist in a light easy to read fashion. Her life experiences are varied and ring true as you travel through her childhood to present day and hear yourself saying &#34;that's right!&#34; along with her. A recommended read for those who want to understand womanhood with a touch of humor.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great routine that you can do every night, it's only 20-25 minutes yet very impactful. I haven't lost weight but I have gotten smaller by toning; I can wear smaller pants now. I also have more energy.<br /><br />Also worth nothing is that the DVD cost less than $10. Compared to a gym membership cost, it is a steal.<br /><br />I would rate it 5 stars except I don't like that every time you turn the DVD on, you need to watch 5-10 minutes of an intro; you cannot fast forward or skip. I've learned to skip back to the beginning and then stop so that its queued up on the following night.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|Lionel Shriver keeps you captivated with this page turner. From not seeing the movie, and not knowing the ending it was a shock to the system. His prose is almost poetic and you become sympathetic with the mother who seemingly lacks compassion at being a mother. A must read - but don't expect to feel happy!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Bought it for my son who could watch it everyday if I allowed him.<br />Very good movie.  Love Sandra and everyone else.
B002L3ARRU|4.0|This is a fun story of kids being ornery and taking a &#34;day off&#34; of school. Yes, it requires suspension of disbelief, and it also includes lying to authority figures who are not as &#34;wise&#34; as the kids. Somewhat tiring elements for parents who prefer good role models for their children.  No, I would not endorse this film for its parenting lessons, but that's clearly not what this story is about. Instead, this film helps us see ourselves in the winners and the losers who are part of the story. The winner is not as great as the loser thinks, and the loser is mostly like all of us.  Take the day off and see this movie - but brace yourself for the needless profanity (read the IMDB parent review for word counts of profanity to decide whether it's for you and your kids).
B00BI73CVI|4.0|What an incredibly sad movie. I thought the revolutionary war was more of what the movie was about, but it dealt more around 3 peoples lives and their interactions with society. Very compelling.
B0012PDVQ2|4.0|I actually had to watch this film for a class on Science Fiction Films of the 20th Century, and I had also just read the source stroy &#34;Do Androids Dream if Electric Sheep?&#34; I truly ejoyed the film and the story, but the two are vastly different. People who are looking for a faithful retelling of the novel, look elsewhere. The film uses some of the basic concepts of the novel, but overall it seems to be much more of a &#34;inspired by...&#34; rather than a &#34;based on.&#34; The film is dark, both in tone and in look. I found the acting great, especially Ford, Hauer, and Sean Young. One of the reasons I had to view this film for class was to examine it as an example of Tech Noir, (a term coined by James Cameron in the Terminator film a few years later, but which can easily be retroactivly applied to this film,) and it truly is an exemplar of the genre. In this version, the voice-over narration has been removed, as has the &#34;happy ending&#34; shot of Decker and Rachel driving through the countryside, and Decker's unicorn dream sequence has been left in. All in all, I agree with these choices, as I believe they are closer to what Scott intended. Some have said that the film is slow and tough to understand. Perhaps it was because I was familiar with the novel, but I did not find it to be too dense of difficult to follow, and the acting is so good and each shot is so interesting visually, that I never thought that the film lagged at all. I steamed this on my computer, but I am really considering picking this up on Blu-Ray, (if available.)
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I had no idea what an amazing president Lincoln had really been. How much opposition he'd had to overcome. This movie made me look up some of the actual history to compare and learn more about his life. I really enjoyed the movie.
B008E374T0|5.0|Gaslight Anthem has quickly become one of my favorite bands of all time.  If I was asked to name my favorite band, I'm not sure I would say Gaslight however if I was to drive cross country and could only bring one album, this would be it.  Handwritten didn't grab me immediately like the previous albums did, but over time this album has grown on me and become my favorite Gaslight album.
B00873IUFE|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times I never grow tired of it which is unusual for me.  It's such a great example of the human spirit, how it can endure even through the worst situations.  It's also a testament to the importance of freedom and redemption.  Love Love Love this movie!
B0049VVE7Y|4.0|So far, this is a great show.  It is very entertaining and as far as TV goes, I would rank The Walking Dead only behind Breaking Bad and Homeland.

A serial killer with a unique motive for killing.  Nice twist on the plot.  Enjoyed that Max and Jesse seemed to respect each other as professionals.  I don't normally read graphic violence, but find myself looking forward to the next book in this series.

B0086900TI|4.0|Some actors seem to squander their talent to point where you wonder if what made them so great was a complete and total fluke; like the just lucked into one of those `right place at the right time' type things and really don't possess the talent you assumed they had.  Adrien Brody was one of those actors for me.  He was staggeringly good in his Oscar winning role in `The Pianist', and yet since 2002 he's starred in a slew of films that seemed to bring out the worst in him.  `The Village', `The Jacket', `King Kong', `The Brothers Bloom'; not all bad films (I happen to adore `The Brothers Bloom' and respect `King Kong') but none did anything for him.  He wasn't memorable and was completely outshined by his co-stars.  He was kind of like the Gyllenhaal of the bunch (although Gyllenhaal also had his redemption this year with `End of Watch').  That brings me to `Detachment', a film I was marginally interested in thanks to the name Tony Kaye and the fact that `American History X' is one of my favorite films of the 90's.  Early ink was very good on this and so I dipped in.  It didn't hurt that the cast was incredible (Caan, Liu, Danner, Cranston, Harden, Hendricks!!!).<br /><br />Brody wowed me.<br /><br />This was a very tough role to play, and Brody carried it off seamlessly.  His commitment to the details of his character's emotional relapsing was sensationally played, and the way that he evoked that inner struggle without playing to the obvious was certainly rewarding.  He was aided by a marvelous supporting turn in Sami Gayle, a stunning young woman who plays a prostitute in need of a helping hand.<br /><br />This film reminded me of a heavier handed and obviously more dramatic version of `Chalk'.  It attempts to look at the earthier side of teaching, the necessary detachment that floods the staff in order to teach without getting too involved.  As Henry (Brody's character) filters through the hallways and tries to remain at a distance, he finds himself inadvertently becoming a rock for his students, and as the world around him comes crushing down full force one gets a better grasp on why he holds the world at such a distance.<br /><br />If nothing else, `Detachment' will get you thinking.becoming a rock for his students, and as the world around him comes crushing down full force one gets a better grasp on why he holds the world at such a distance.<br /><br />If nothing else, `Detachment' will get you thinking.

B00A83075M|5.0|There are few films as delightfully `whole' as `Wreck-It Ralph' was last year.  It's the perfect mix of nostalgia with a clever twist and new age sentiments with ravishing visuals and emotional heart.  The amount of detail put into this film, the backstory, the backgrounds, the character interactions; it's spot on perfect and something that unveils itself even further each and every viewing.<br /><br />The film centers around Ralph, the villain in a game called `Fix-It Felix Jr.'.  In the game, Ralph is the brute who `wrecks' an apartment complex and Felix is the hero who races after him to fix his mess.  This isn't a problem, since it's his job, but after hours Ralph is still treated like an outcast, shunned by the other members of his game and forced to sleep in a dump.  Saddened by his life, Ralph decides that he no longer wants to be a `bad guy' but instead wants to be a hero.  This causes him to game jump, looking for a video game that will award him a medal, but this leads to serious trouble when he sneaks into an alien war game and accidentally transports an evil alien into a fun and happy racing game.  Upon entering `Sugar Land Rush' (the name of the racing game) he uncovers a dark plot against a spunky glitch named Vanellope and soon discovers that being a bad guy doesn't automatically make him a `bad guy'.<br /><br />The voice work is very good here, with John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Alan Tudyk and Jack McBrayer being perfect choices for their roles.  Jane Lynch basically plays herself, but we all love her so it's not a big deal.  The sets are nicely crafted and the attention to detail (which I mentioned before) is all the more reason to soak this one in.<br /><br />For me though, it is the beautiful moral that keeps me coming back to this special movie.  The amount of heart given to the film's development and the self-sacrificing spirit donned by the big hearted wrecking ball is such a beautiful thing to watch.  Yes, I cried.  My eyes started to tear as Ralph plunged himself towards the Mentos ceiling.<br /><br />Disney has done something really special here, creating a new `Toy Story' of sorts; an instant classic that is targeted at both boys and girls (my daughters LOVE this movie) as well as their parents (all the references to games I played in my youth gave me such a warm feeling) and one that is sure to entertain and engage us for years to come.as Ralph plunged himself towards the Mentos ceiling.<br /><br />Disney has done something really special here, creating a new `Toy Story' of sorts; an instant classic that is targeted at both boys and girls (my daughters LOVE this movie) as well as their parents (all the references to games I played in my youth gave me such a warm feeling) and one that is sure to entertain and engage us for years to come.

B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|Proof that there are all kinds of `true stories' to be told; `The Sessions' is a very different kind of biopic.  Telling the story of Mark O'Brien, `The Sessions' is a sweet hearted look at one man's struggle to lose his virginity.<br /><br />Mark is a paralyzed poet who spends most of his time in an iron lung and has limited communication with people outside of his helpers and his priest.  Mark eventually decides that he wants to have sexual relations with a woman and so, with the support from his priest he decides to contact a sex therapist.  That is when he meets Cheryl.  Cheryl is a middle aged woman who serves as a sex surrogate.  She'll give Mark six sessions where he can explore his sexuality with Cheryl and eventually have relations with her.  That will be his introduction to the world of sex, and from there he is on his own.  Being nervous and inexperienced, and being in a condition that isn't always accommodating, his first few sessions don't pan out as expected, but eventually he gets the hang of things.<br /><br />The great thing about `The Sessions' is that it really steers far away from being overtly sympathetic.  It never demands that we mourn over Mark's condition.  Instead, we celebrate his freedoms and the way that he handles his predicament, never making it a sore spot or allowing it to hold him back.  His supreme optimism in the face of the unknown is admirable, and the light hearted approach to his plight helps put things in perspective.  I also found both John Hawkes and Helen Hunt to be delightful here, especially Hunt, who manages to ease herself (and the audience) into every scene.<br /><br />Such a natural performance.<br /><br />I do wish that `The Sessions' felt a bit heavier in parts.  The light hearted tone, while effective in not being reduced to the expected, also becomes a tad overdone to the point where the impact of this particular story is deadened in the end.  When all is said and done, it leaves the audience with a bit of `is that what this was all about', and that wasn't expected.  Still, I recommend this because it approaches a very taboo subject from a different vantage point and serves up an inspiring story we could all learn from.at what this was all about', and that wasn't expected.

B008JFUUIA|4.0|Maybe this is this generations `Bring it On'.  I mean, it would make sense.  It is a beloved chick flick with bite and it centers around little publicized competition (this being `Glee' inspired a cappella groups, the latter being cheerleading).  I know that throwing comparisons can be lazy (and a tad misleading) but this one fits rather well.<br /><br />`Bring it On' was a better film, but that isn't saying that `Pitch Perfect' isn't pretty lovable.<br /><br />The film follows a similar narrative.  In this film we are introduced to Beca, an aspiring DJ who gets suckered into joining an all-girl a cappella group in hopes to dethroning the arrogant boys group at the finals.  Hesitant, she is soon caroled into the spirit of it all but balks at the lame musical choices and the dictatorship happening within the group.  Her musicality makes an impression on a few of the members of the group, but their rigid leader is determined to keep things `her way'.  Throw in a forbidden romance between Beca and Jesse, a member of the rival all-boys group, and you have a little `Romeo + Juliet' with you `Bring it On'.<br /><br />All in all, I really liked this one.  The cast, for the most part, is really fun.  Rebel Wilson is hilarious and completely owns this movie.  The pacing is great, and despite the predictability of it all (you know she'll get the guy, you know her group will come together in the end) it is still so rewarding to watch it unfold.  I also love almost any chick flick that has music or dancing at the core.  It's just entertaining, and my love of `Glee' (at least the first two seasons) trickles heavily into my bias for a film about singing, especially a cappella.  Still, there is this nagging detractor, and that is my distaste for Anna Kendrick.  I just find her so plain and boring.  There is nothing special about this girl and she continues to bore me in everything.  I know she has an Oscar nomination under her belt (so undeserved) but I am just so apathetic towards her performances.  She is at the center of every scene here, but thankfully the spunkiness of the film itself and the fun of the supporting cast outweigh her blandness.<br /><br />Oh, and my decade-long crush on Brittany Snow got amped up a notch when she went red.s her performances.

B000Y5JFNE|5.0|years back I was disappointed by the DVD transfer which felt almost identical to my VHS copy.  The remastering in this edition brings a great enhancement to color, sound and shadow detail.  There is a fair amount of film grain in the copy, but given the grimy and war-torn nature of this fantasy world, I would argue that it is an aesthetic present in the movie that adds to the experience.<br />Also, in middle school I read the novelization and loved the shark-boy sequence and was sad it did not make it to the film.  I enjoyed getting to see the deleted scene for the first time, though it was a weak scene from an FX standpoint and can understand why it was omitted from the final cut.

0345505387|2.0|Looked forward very much to receiving this graphic novel but when I got it and started looking thought it I was totally disappointed. The colored pictures were fuzzy at times and often Jamie was drawn as down right ugly (Jamie is NOT ever ugly in my imagination). Also, often I could not tell who was who by the facial features drawn as they were. Characters were not distinctive enough. Very disappointed, I hope that any more of these graphic novels will be drawn better but I will not purchase one sight unseen again. If I buy any more it will only be if I can see some up close examples of the quailty of the illustrations. The books need a new illustrator who can capture the faces of the characters in more (finer)detail. Or perhaps have the illustrations in black and white and grey so that there can be a cleaner picture but I am not sure that even being in black and white will be an improvement with the illustrator that the author chose. Such a bummer!  I don't think I even finished reading the whole novel. It was poorly executed and colored. I have seen graphic novels that were much better done as far as the drawings and colors go so I know it can be done, just take a look at the online graphic novel 'Teahouse,' it is exquisitely done. I just wonder why it was not done correctly for this project.

0062127241|2.0|I'm about a third of my way through this book and have yet to read anything of any real interest to ME, the average fan. Pete will mention an album, song, or famous friend and then hurriedly rush through the sketchiest of details, dismissing Woodstock as if it were just a gig to be played over a rainy week-end. The other members of the band are given short shrift. Roger Daltrey? John Entwhistle? \\"The Ox\\"?, for crying out loud! Keith Moon? All three are spoken about as if referring to casual pals, not band-mates that were there in the van with you, driving to some s*** one-nighter in some dim pub in the hinterlands. \\"I Can See for Miles\\" is dismissed over a couple of paragraphs on separate pages. I realize this is not a expose of the underbelly of the band or a dissertation on every song he ever wrote, but....c'mon. I'm not sure if I have the will or interest to finish this book. The rest of us have our own problems, Pete. It sounds as if I had a better time listening to your songs than you had writing or playing them.

0071762345|5.0|\\"Likeable Social Media; How to Delight Your Customers, Create an Irresistible Brand, and Be Generally Amazing on Facebook (and other social networks)\\" by Dave Kerpen is an excellent and in-depth look into how to use social media for business, and kind of impact it can have. Kerpen starts the introduction by telling a personal story of how his experience in Vegas, and simple tweet from a hotel led to thousands of connections, and profits for that hotel. All from one simple tweet, and the \\"like\\" button on Facebook. By starting with this story, Kerpen allows for the readers to see that he understands exactly what he is writing about, and the real life impact that it can have. You don't feel like you are being lectured at by some old guy. You get the sense that what you are reading has been thought up and put into this book by someone that has seen social media's powers first hand, and understand what it is capable of.<br />  The book is divided in 18 different chapters that all take on different aspects of using social media in the business world, and how to make yourself more \\"likeable\\" on social media sites like Facebook.com. Throughout the entire book, you feel like Kerpen is talking with you, not at you or above you. Everything is simply stated, but not so much that it makes you feel like he things you are dumb. He relates what he is talking about to numerous real life stories, allowing the readers to see the ideas actually put into action.<br />  As Kerpen points out \\"The social media revolution has given consumers around the world the most powerful voice they've ever had.\\" He couldn't be more right about that, and this book shows you how to use that voice in the best possible.<br />  Let's take a look at one of the highlights from the book. One thing that stood out to me was chapter 2, and the idea of \\"hypertargeting\\" or \\"nanotargeting\\"; the basis for both of these ideas is companies gearing a marketing and advertising effort toward a specific group through individuals' social media profiles, activities, and networks. What I liked about this section was that Dave put into actual action by sending a nanotargeted ad to his wife saying \\"I Love You Carrie\\" and she was able to send one back to him. He didn't put his wife name in the options. He just put her age, occupation, and location, and Facebook found her. I loved this because Dave really showed the power of social media, and how it can do things that we honestly never think possible. It is a great for business to target specific people that they want using or buying their project.<br />  Now that you have a little bit of a taste of what this book can show you, I highly recommended buying it. Whether you own a small business, a large company, or are just interested in social media; this is a great read that goes over all difference aspects of social media, and giving yourself a \\"likeable\\" presence online.

B00BD2DRHW|3.0|I did use the tutorial which is the first &quot;island&quot; of tutoria.  It starts out okay but doesn't really teach much of anything so far, just tells about some materials.  You don't really get a choice of materials when building, once the bridge is built it looks like you can toggle between wood and metal.  There seems to be a budget for building but that doesn't show up until after you test the bridge and then look at the badges.  Compared to Link as a bridge builder app,  I'd choose it rather that rather than this one.  I'll probably  keep this since it was free and try to figure it out anyway but don't know how much I'll end up playing.  As to the sounds, i can only suggest lowering the volume as there is nowhere I can find to turn it off.

B004HWYTP4|5.0|Funny and surprisingly PG content. Any movie with Morgan Freeman & John Malcovich has gotta be good, plus a funny side of Bruce Willis
B004SUDPWI|5.0|From start to finish, this blu-ray edition of a 1957 Best Picture (7 Academy Awards total) is by far the best rendering of this classic film, set in 1942-1943, WW2 Burma (filmed in Ceylon).  The sounds and color are richer than the VHS or DVD versions which this disc replaced.  The 5.1 surround sound is richer than ever and grips you immediately from the start to its climatic finish when filtered through a Denon amplifier.  The original full screen Cinemascope is transferred well into blu ray format.  The HD colors and images are larger-than-life on an LED TV.  The story plot, while based on some facts, is mostly fictional (original bridge was bombed from the air).  However, the clash of wills between British Commander Nicholson and Japanese camp commander Saito illustrate how far men will go to achieve what they deem is important to them and their men, while trying to maintain discipline and morale in the face of overwhelming odds.  The final line from the British doctor says it all:  &#34;Madness....Madness!!&#34;.

By the time I finished reading the story Tatiana de Rosney wrote, I was inexplicably involved -- both as perpetrator and as victim.  It was a confronting read.
B00BD2DRHW|1.0|So adding 'playground'  is now sufficient to make it 'ok'  to use the same name of a game made by another developer, and in your description imply that was your work by comparing to the original as if this is a sequel?<br /><br />Open network sockets means the app wants to not just access the Internet,  but accept incoming connections as well.

0553386794|5.0|First off, I love when authors aren't afraid to kill off main characters. Nothing in this book is predictable, which makes for an exciting reading experience. The world GRRM creates is unthinkably vast, and I love the introduction of each new character (though I admittedly struggle to keep them all straight!) I've read all of the other books in this series (impatiently waiting for the next), but I have a deep appreciation for this first book as it sets the scene and pace for those to follow. Amazingly well though out plot. It's really just incredible!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|While constantly hearing about North Korea in the news, very few of us have the smallest idea of what that country is like and how people can be so manipulated and hold us and the rest of the world in contempt. This novel really was thought provoking and takes you into the minds of the characters. I thought it was magnificent!
0440245206|2.0|Danielle Steel is wildly successful, and I've tried time and time again to see what readers find so appealing about her books. Maybe I'm overly critical, but the incessant repetition of information, which seems to be this author's trademark, is mind numbing. I found this book, in particular, difficult to get through. I didn't love any of the characters, and I didn't feel that the story truly went anywhere. At the end I was left feeling like I'd just wasted hours of my life.

Suitable for seeing again and again, because it is a great work of art.<br /><br />If you are an artist or an art lover, you must see this film.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|The kids grew up and the everyday routine began, they were in love, but so distant.  The movie had adult content and I would not recommend it be watched with your kids. Every couple should take the time to really talk to each other when they are unhappy.

B007REV4YI|3.0|Had really been looking forward to this movie & had heard positive comments when it was released, but this was just &#34;so-so&#34; for a Bond film.  Unengaging bad-guy, in my opinion.  I enjoyed the Scottish homestead scenery near the end, and the explosions and action in that part of the movie may have been the most action of the entire show, but those held few surprises which made them less than thrilling as well.  Maybe the title song by Adele, and old-fashioned traditional Bond opening credits were the only thing to hit more than 3 stars.
B0081336FO|5.0|Of the many actors who have played Sherlock Holmes from Basil Rathbone to Jeremy Brett to Robert Downey, none has done a better job of capturing the essential oddness of the man than Benedict Cumberbatch.  By playing Holmes as a quasi-sociopath, he makes his obsessive brilliance seem believable.  He also pulls off what is perhaps the hardest assignment for an actor, namely,  portraying a genius and making us believe in him. He's helped in this regard by the clever device of on-screen phrases that tell us what he's deducing from the things he is seeing.  The writing is crisp and funny with occasional in-jokes (a flight that is going to be bombed is Flight 007, for example) and there are strong actors in the other roles.  A winner all the way around. .
B008XX6J4C|4.0|like the music very much  saw them on PBS and wanted the CD found it very entertaining would buy more
B0001MIQHQ|1.0|I bought this dvd, and am not able to play it in any of my dvd players besides my laptop due to regional issues.  I will not purchase anything from this company again.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|A favorite of the Bronte. The story of the family and its interactions is dynamic and well-written. A great book to read over and over.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Outliers: the one sided story of success.<br />The professional writer Malcolm Gladwell tells thought-provoking stories of Bill Gates, professional hockey players, and immigrants whose opportunities that turned them into millionaires and professionals. Similarly, he tells stories of people who weren't successful, or died, because they didn't have the right opportunities.<br />Outliers may cause some to blame their unsuccessful life on a lack of opportunity, and/or encourage you to pursue opportunity.<br />Some have criticized his stories as anecdotal, or one-sided. Unfortunately, Gladwell emphasizes opportunity so much that fundamental characteristics of successful people like hard-work, patience, persistence, and response to failure almost seem insignificant.
B0082RHRHC|3.0|A good read ruined by repeatedly bad movies but also much more of a love story and bittersweet ending than Wuthering Heights.
B000001EGA|3.0|Overall, I think this album is very over rated with only a couple of really good songs -- Someone Saved My Life Tonight, Curtains and Meal Ticket.  The rest are ok, but nothing else stands out and there are no other really good distinctive melodies.  OK effort.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Keeps me entertained....good graphics....a must have game for horse lover's.....it is very addictive...only downfall is it is too difficult to earn gems
B009JBZH54|5.0|It is batman on blue ray....what could go wrong? Arrived well, plays well, a great addition to any persons blue ray collection. The book too is amazing!
B005LAIIKI|4.0|typical QT movie.  good cast and good acting.  the only thing is that too much fake blood exploding on bodies when shot, otherwise, i would give this movie a 5 stars.<br /><br />the best part was QT got blown up with just one shot from django.  hubby and i couldn't stop laughing.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|I recently caught the HBO broadcast of Gary Oldman's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and am so happy that I never bought this version.  Alec Guinness's George Smiley displays all the foibles and inadequacies of the Smiley in John Le Carre's brilliant novel.  Gary Oldman plays the role as a bland, cold, staring, arrogant omnipotence.  They call this acting?  A mounted bass trophy could perform as well.  No, if you don't already possess it, invest in a copy of the preeminent BBC miniseries to gaze awestruck at the gallery of shining British acting performances, Guinness's among that of so many others from Britain's venerable old acting royalty of its day.  Of course, the real problem comes in attempting to squeeze John Le Carre's meticulously unfolding Cold War thriller (5 hours by the BBC version) into a dreadfully ill-fitting 2-hour girdle.  What can be patiently developed by paced acting performances and intact sections dialogue from the novel-- in the Gary Oldman led production has to be quickly, \\"mysteriously\\" conveyed in soliloquies from Oldman to an impish and prudish looking Benedict Cumberbatch.  I wouldn't tell someone not to purchase the Oldman's Tinker Tailer, particularly if you think Gary Oldeman walks on water and not coincidently are of the type who doesn't wonder why they substitute grape juice for wine at communion or thinks that too doesn't matter much.  That is how the 2011 version, in my opinion, compares to the BBC version-- water to wine.  On the other hand, if you want to fully savor John Le Carre's marvellous tale, invest in the BBC and not the 2011 version to adorn your home DVD collection.  I can't imagine that you won't appreciate the penultimate BBC version.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|The only live show I saw was Ka in Vegas and loved every minute of it.  I want to see other Cirque shows too but couldn't afford.  Bought this BD with no expectations.  But wow!  It has every one of the Cirque shows in Vegas and a love story to boot.<br /><br />You must get this if you're a fan of Cirque Du Soleil.
B001QJUX24|5.0|One of John Wayne's greatest rolls. I think my favorite thing about The Searchers is that it is a classic western in every sense, but most of the film takes place in the greener wooded lands of Colorado (I think), which is a nice change of pace from the more stereotypical southwestern desert regions usually depicted in Western films.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Westerns, and you haven't seen The Searchers, move it to the top of your list because you're missing an important one.
B006GHA9VQ|2.0|The music is very good but they should stop at Phantom of the Opera.  Sequel is so unnecessary.  The whole cast seemed off with no chemistry with one another.  The boy has a wonderful voice and will have a great future tho.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am hooked waiting for next season to start again. This season took many surprising turns and confronts many moral dilemmas. .
0307895475|4.0|Fours stars. I would give it five, except that the print is hard to read. The font size is small and the color of the background make it difficult.<br />That being said, this guide covers everything.
B002YICN74|5.0|As said in the review , the product was new and authentic . The product arrived on time, also, in perfect conditions; That's the reason I choose these rating.
030758836X|3.0|I liked her previous &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; and looked forward to this book especially with all the great buzz it got.  But ultimately it disappointed.  It's hard for me to enjoy a story when all of the characters are equally unlikeable.  And the end was bad.<br /><br />It was super readable and a page-turner, points for that, but overall it failed in too many ways for me to really like it very much.
B005DD7H50|5.0|I would recommend this movie to all of my  friends. It  was great and it kept me wondering what was going  to happen  next.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I wish I'd written this immediately after reading it - I was so fired up with how much I hated this book.  There were so many things I found off-putting in his writing style - for one, a strange arrogance and need to blow his own horn came through loud and clear.  So many mentions of how special his family and distant relatives are/were -- added nothing to the story but seemed like a way to overcompensate for some insecurity of his.  Also, the way he described his very loving parents and wonderful up-bringing it didn't seem to reconcile with how upset he was about being adopted and needing to force his birth parents to acknowledge his existence.  Having a bit of a rough period as an adult because of that -- can't remember now if he described it as a depression or just not acting like himself...just seemed very cry-babyish to me.<br /><br />The fact that he was a neurosurgeon should've lent credibility to the medical explanation but again there was a lot that was off-putting and seemed like he was making special exceptions for what happened in his case versus what normally happens to someone else in a similar situation.  Again, I read this a while ago and can't remember specifics so this is a really crappy review but it seemed clear to me at the time that his brain was reacting to the infection and doing what it &#34;normally&#34; does in those situations -- not sending him off to heaven.<br /><br />So many things about this book were irritating.  It made me think, wow, our brains are amazing and gee, he's lucky to be alive, but not once - awesome, this guy saw heaven.  Blek.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I like having a keyboard to enter my note, having freeform to put in whatever I want to put in.
B008XCPO2Q|4.0|I like this movie but mostly I love the great buy. I received it right away once I paid for dvd.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I had high expectations for this book.  I kept hearing how great it was.  Also, I was told that as an Eagles fan I HAD to read this book.  For what it's worth, here are my thoughts.<br /><br />1.  I HATED how the mental institution was referred to as \\"the bad place\\".  It made the main character seem very juvenile to me.<br /><br />2.  His obsessive workout routine was a bit much.  I get it you work out to escape your problems.  With that being said, it didn't hurt to know Bradley Cooper plays him in the movie.  It made for some very yummy visuals ;)  I have yet to see the movie.<br /><br />3. While it was fun to read about old Eagles players and tailgating/watching games.  I think it was a bit farfetched that a loss would ruin someone's entire week.<br /><br />All in all, the book wasn't a bad read....just not a great read.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I really enjoy Mitch Rapp.... he is a true no hold barred character, I really enjoy all of Vince Flynn`s books
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this app ;) I'm always playing it.. very addictive.. I recommend this app to everyone especially. thoes who love horses.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|This season, while progressing nicely in the beginning, lulled quickly towards the last half of the season an didn't really resolve much in the end.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great game..Great fun. Still have issues that need to be worked out, such as how long it takes to level up and freezing at times, however, I love this addicting game!!!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I wish we had leaders like Lincoln today.  A dynamic and though provoking film. six more words are now needed.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The movie is everything I expected. I couldn't wait to have it so I preordered it and it was waiting for me when I returned home from work on the day of release!!
B009VIZDLI|2.0|This book reeks of that nerdy guy in The Big Bang Theory. Certainly it's all very familiar to the point of almost being hackneyed. Still, somewhat funny.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one of the better free apps that I have purchased. So much so I actually plan to purchase the paid app soon. I like how this app accurately communicates my battery life, condition, and charge history. The ads are very unobtrusive. The calibration takes a while but worth the time it takes to complete.
B007X15GRQ|4.0|If you want a good action movie with an enjoyable plot, this is a good selection. Fun to watch and entertaining.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Enjoyed the film. Acting was very good and story enjoyable.  Slow in parts, but good accounting of what happened and well presented.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Great movie! Worthy of the the other Lord Of The Rings Movies.  Martin Freeman speech and physical acting was on spot.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|What this young woman does with a violin is simply amazing to me.  Her music drills into my soul and soothes it.  Maybe it's just me, but I can't stop listening.
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|All I can say right now is that the more films Terrence Malick makes, the less they are films and the more they are experiences with no nouns suitable to name them or adjectives suitable to describe them. The best I can do is call it pure cinema. What cinema is supposed to be. Hitchcock talked about it. Kubrick talked about it. Malick is doing it. It is cinema.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Though there are somethings from the book that are left out, it is still an amazing movie! I will be able to watch this over and over and still love it everytime! I do not regret buying this!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This is a fast reading novel and I would recommend it to adults as well as teens. It was entertaining & educational.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|Great Music. Played out in my pool area. My Neighbor, looked over the fence and asked . Who is that singing.
0525952926|5.0|I love stories about the families, the war and the loves during WW2. The things that I have heard and read about were made real to me reading this series. The cruelty of the Nazi' were made real because you got to know the people that it happen too. Murdering people because of their religion, gang rapes on the women and the war were so real. And Ethel and Fitz, please let them tell everyone how they really feel. This is the only thing that infuriates me. In \\"The Fall of Giants\\" it is obvious just as it is in this book. I am waiting, anxiously,for the next one. Please hurry!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Great game, very addictive my daughter loves to play this game. She is very  fond of the monkeys! I would suggest this game to anyone looking to have a good time while wasting time.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|You will be transported by the velvet sounds of Andrea Bocelli's voice! Do not hesitate, by it today, you will love it!
B001GA1RFA|4.0|This is now my second book of John Green's.  Without question, he's turning into one of my favorite book authors.  After reading 'The Fault in Our Stars' he managed to bring out a great deal of emotions in that book from laughing to crying.  Once again, John Green's writing and imagination mixed with humor and touching moments simply pulled me into 'An Abundance of Katherines.'  His character development and plot building is well-meshed making it hard for me to stop reading the book once I started.  My favorite character in the whole book had to be Hassan.  He's your average looking guy, with a Muslim background, lazy when it comes to his future and loves his Judge Judy; but he does know how to pick up a friend's spirits especially when it comes to the main character Collin Singleton, who happens to be going through another tough breakup with his 19th Katherine.  Hassan has some great lines in the book yet  one of the best lines I've ever read in a book was when he said, \\"The ladies come to big daddy, 'cause big daddy ain't got no car.\\"  Total LOL-moment!  I'd definitely say if you read the \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" or any John Green books and haven't read this one, don't hesitant to buying 'An Abundance of Katherines'.  Quite fun and a joy to read!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|So far I have at least 5 cd's by Joe and I'm not sure which I like the best, because they are all GREAT!
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Have enjoyed every book ever written by Michael Connelly, and The Reversal did not disappoint! Go get this book now!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is the most amazing series I have seen. Very addicting, could never watch just one episode. Can't wait to watch season 3.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It keeps getting better and better. Never a dull moment. I was very sad to come to the end of this season. Very sad ending. Can't wait to have season 4 come out! What a story!!!!!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I love all the Mac Lane books.  They are fun and sexy.  The dialogue makes you laugh and is smart and quick.  You really like the characters in all these novels!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Not bad, a bit unreal at times but hey it is an animated style movie,right.Anyways its worth at least one full watch.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|It was a great show.  I wasn't sure if they were going to pull it off, but it was great.  I actually liked it more than the others.  I think they should have started here in the first place.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|This has become one of my favorites.  It wasn't a dark show.  It had a good storyline to it and was a nice change from alot of the movies they make now - In this movie, they keep their clothes on.  So it was nice to see their acting capabilities stand out.  I plan on ordering the disc since I only rented it the first time I saw it.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|This is the best one out of the series of Cars movies. My boys enjoy watching it over and over.
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|I have always loved this movie and now my children enjoy it also. I would recommend to anyone i know.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I had a brain aneurysm and so really understand brain injuries and changes in peoples lives because of this.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is one of the best movies. I watched it in the theaters and have watched it multiple time on Amazon. Love this movie.
0425263916|5.0|Sizzling!!!!! A really hot, well written book.  Love the way Sylvia Day writes. Looking forward to getting her next book
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I really like my Marware Kindle Fire HD case! It is very easy to \\"snap\\" the Kindle in. The elastic strap that holds the cover in place when shut works very well. I am also thrilled with the \\"on/off\\" feature of the case. When my Kindle Fire is on and I put it in the case and close the cover, it automatically puts it into \\"sleep\\" mode and turns off the screen. When I open the case back up, the Kindle comes back on. Genius! However, I want to state that I only use the case when transporting my device, as I personally don't like the bulk of a case or cover (of any brand or style) for daily use around the house. Fortunately it is so quick and easy to install and remove from the case, it works very well for me!
B004GJYROG|3.0|The disc plays fine but it is missing the bonus disc. It was very inexpensive so I really don't mind but it should incude what it says on the package. My son was confused.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|The picture quality was great, but the movie was very disappointing. It was slow and did not hold my attention.
B00AYJCEYC|3.0|thought there would be more motown songs, very dissapointed, i like michael bolton but this was not one of his best
B008JFUUQ2|2.0|Not very good condition at all, the dvd case and protector are completely torn and faded, I have not had a chance to watch the whole dvd but I would not be surprised if there are scratches!

B0018M6J90|5.0|Loved the movie -- had seen it when it was newly released.  A real feel good movie.  This was a gift for my daughter at her request. This is one of her favorites.  It is worth viewing.
0800141849|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie.  This is one of our &#34;chick-flick&#34; collections.  I love Babs no matter what, and her pairing with Jeff Bridges was my dream come true.  Tis truly a Saturday morning, stay in bed, and watch this movie.  Love, love,love it.  This was a requested gift for my daughter.  I already have this movie on vhs.  I guess it is time for me to purchase my dvd copy.
B0044WUQ3G|5.0|It is one of those things you pray never happens to you, stuck on a ski lift in the breezing cold and the employees are gone for the night and not coming back for 5 days.  I would recommend this to a friend.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Justin knocked it out of the park! Every song on the album was awesome!  My fav was \\"Let the Groove Get In\\"  The latin beat and feel of it was hypnotic.  I dare you to sit still when it's playing!  A Wonderful dance song!<br /><br />This album was worth every penny paid.  You won't go wrong.
0385671717|5.0|Have already read the book.  Wanted it for my library.  Price was excellent, slight impairment on front cover. not a problem, a great value,
B00BQ1D91E|4.0|First off, my review is for the vinyl version.<br /><br />The album is great, although not nearly as heavy as Opus Eponymous or quite as catchy. I'm sure this will grow on me over the next couple of days.<br /><br />My beef is with the quality of the vinyl pressing, recording, and packaging. There is a subtle wrinkle in my copy of the lp that spans from the outer edge to 3\\" from center. The wrinkle is most pronounced at the edge. On playback, the wrinkle creates a thump in the background of the music, at the outer edge (and especially on Side B) it actually skips the needle on the first 10 revolutions. The beginning of the first tracks are essentially intolerable to listen to, and the quiet moments of the first half of each side have a steady thump. I'll have to send this back. The recording quality is not nearly as good as Opus Eponymous,  but I'm going to chalk that up to a bad vinyl pressing.<br />The packaging is cheap and poorly constructed, edges do not line up. However the artwork is lovely and evil.<br /><br />Even though this is not the 70's, apparently some of the manufacturing demons of that time still exist.<br /><br />As a Satanist, musician, and audiophile, I'm a bit disappointed in the quality of the overall product. The music is fantastic, but the presentation is s***, which goes against my values of perfection, professionalism, and appearance. In all things Satanists are to be the best there is at what they do. The music earns them the 4 stars. But buyer beware, the lack of quality control by their chosen manufacturer (which, I hear, was the 5th company they went to, and the only one willing to print their blasphemous artwork) may create an extra hassle for you.<br /><br />I'm glad I am insane and bought a cd copy also AND can enjoy the free dowload that came with the vinyl copy.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|Enjoyable and fun to watch with the entire family. The fact that the movie was inspired by a real story made the movie more engaging.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful new spin on post apocalypse society. Kind of a futuristic Roman gladiator story with the age-old question of love and survival.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I used this video to give background information for the novel &#34;Esperanza Rising&#34;. The movie shows what the Okies had to endure, and fills in a gap that is missing in Esperanza.
B00946XX28|5.0|Daft Punk is one of my favorite dance groups ever and this disc proves they are one of the best.
6305127646|5.0|Came brand new, played perfect. Totally awesome movie, one of my favorites with Val Kilmer. Now I just need the dvd of his movie Real Genius.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|The pieces are very small and the completed cubes are small too. Looks bigger so read the specs carefully before purchasing.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I have downloaded it to my kindle fire HD, but when I try to open it, it will not respond
B000FC130E|5.0|Neil Gaiman, is a brilliant author all of his books always have me in suspense this is a great book.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Beautiful animation, Bumpin' soundtrack, Insane, off the wall racing action.<br /><br />This movie was in production for around 8 years, and you can really tell. I've re-watched it multiple times and am always discovering new details. Once again: This movie is gorgeous. The animation style is a bit different from your standard 'anime' movie, but that just adds to the uniqueness of this masterpiece.<br /><br />To top it all off, the english voice cast is actually pretty good. I watched it with both subs and dubs. The Japanese voice cast is great of course, but it's nice to watch this movie in English as well. There's usually so much going on at once, reading subs and trying to watch all the action can be a bit much.
1612680011|5.0|This book really changed the way a look at life, work and business. I realized I was doing it all backward since thats the way \\"everybody\\" does it. This is the type of book that should be a must read for everyone, this should be a requirement to graduate for high school even. But even at any stage of your life you come to realize how your financial mentality should envision and work towards your goal.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|Great 2nd album from a much under recognised folk rock poet. If you like folk rock, street poetry, discourse on life, love, lust, sadness, joy, hard work and everything in-between all set to music in the style of greats such as Dylan, Neil Young et al...  then you'll love Rodriguez! And if you don't have it already, look up the first album.... Cold fact. Pure magic, classic rock poetry in music!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|For such a short game, it was immensely fun!  The level of detail in each of the puzzles and riddles made this game addictive.  As another reviewer said, don't use the hints unless you absolutely have to.  At this price this game was a bargain.  Looking forward to the sequel!
1455128333|5.0|Silver Linings was was recently purchased for an upcoming road trip.  It was a perfect driving companion.  With warm humor, the story wove together the lives of two individuals who find their way in life through the challenges of depression.  Beautifully told!
1400069742|5.0|Books about World War II interest me very much, not only from the position of a History major enjoying reading about something from the past, but also because both my father and father-in-law fought (and survived) this conflict. I thought that I knew quite a bit about the times leading up to December 7, 1941, but after reading this book I can see that I was mistaken.<br /><br /> Most Americans are aware that there was strong opposition to the idea of the US getting involved in the war in Europe, but now I see the strength of this opposition, and the many well-known people in these isolationist organizations, especially Charles Lindbergh.<br /><br /> The book goes into great detail about Lindbergh's activities in the late 30s and early 40s without judging his motives. I believe that he sincerely held his beliefs, as can be seen by his actions after war was declared. What surprised me the most was how FDR was so afraid of the people that he directed his actions based on polls. In times of serious danger to the country, that's not a very good way to initiate (or not initiate, in this case) foreign policy. It's clear that, if Hitler hadn't declared war on the US,  we would have gone into a purely Pacific war, leaving<br />England in the lurch, with Lord only knows what consequences might have ensued.<br /><br /> This book is a cautionary tale in hesitation in politics for all the wrong reasons, and it is an excellent one.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|This show has some gruesome imagery, and may lack depth in some of its characterizations, but it is a weirdly engrossing thriller, and it succeeds for those with the stomach for such things.  The writers try hard to provide some of the motivation for the unspeakable crimes committed by the Followers, but most of the emotional impact comes from the interplay between Kevin Bacon's damaged FBI ex-agent Ryan Hardy, Natalie Zea's Claire Carroll, the show's only well-balanced character, and James Purefoy's Joe, who is characterized as a serial killer, but who is so much more.  I enjoy that the FBI team tracking Joe is composed of such baggage-laden individuals, each with a propensity to act impulsively in their pursuit, giving the plot an edge of unpredictability.  One ploy that's getting a bit tired, though, are repeated approaches by supposedly sympathetic Followers, who then turn to lethally attack the FBI team when they have let their guard down.  But it's Joe's character and actions that provide the show's greatest strength and its greatest weakness.  His apparent charisma as a teacher is mirrored by his diabolic power and mind-control as recruiter of murderous followers.  His use of pre-existing fringe networks as talent pools and their organization as an instrument of his unfolding master plan is ingeniously shown, as well as all the tech-gimickry of secret websites, untraceable sat phones,etc.  The weakness, for me at least, is the simple question, &#34;who's paying for all this?&#34;  Joe is a college professor, failed novelist, and a cult leader.  His organization appears to have the military armament, tech resources, and funding of a sponsored terror network, just like on 24 (which would have had oil money, blood diamonds, or a drug smuggling cartel behind it).<br />His Followers are many, but no one has been shown to be his financial &#34;Angel&#34;.  But if you can set your rational skepticism aside you can enjoy a weekly occurrence of white knuckles grippingyour sofa arm or that of anyone you're with.
B002A4Q652|5.0|I had previously sampled all of the tracks on this album prior to purchase. After listening to the entire album a few times I realized that I have discovered a real gem in the genre. As always, the ordering and shipment process and timing met my expectations.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I saw this in the theater twice, I bought the Blu-ray and DVD commemorative Edition and watched it many times.  Seeing it instant-on with my Prime subscription means I can watch it at any whim.  This is awesome =)
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is great. It is plug and play, you don't need the software if you want a minimal installation. It does help because it maps the buttons. I am \\"upgrading\\" from a Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000 and this mouse is just as big. It fits the palm very well, just the tips of the pinkie finger and ring finger rubs on the mouse pad. I have yet used it from FPS gaming but it does well on Darksiders and League of Legends. It has a very nice build, the only flaw is that the buttons that rest on the thumb isn't as flush as the rest of the mouse, a very small amount of play is there but it isn't the only thing wrong with it. I believe it is made from the USA so thats a plus if you want to \\"buy American\\" as this is a quality product. One other tick is that the Anchor is the only thing that could change in the light color, not the scroll wheel or those three lights near the index finger. To me it isn't much as a big deal, just slightly misleading as I thought those would also be color changing too.<br /><br />Compared to the M$ mouse I used it is considerably lighter, something I thought would change when I put all the weights, but it that one is still pretty heavy.<br />For the price this thing is amazing, this review is only within the month I had bought it but it is lovely.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|everyone did an excellent job, I've already watched it twice,and Im sure i'll watch it again. Good night to all, and to all a good night
B001458MI2|1.0|Bought the cd for four dollars on amazon. It sucks. That's all there is to say. Every song on there is horrible. It's a collection of her worst.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. My 2 year old loves it as well. There was tons of humor, and the chosen lyrics cracked me up! Super happy my toddler picked this one out!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Clean, creative, funny drama! Who could ask for more?  It is so easy to get involved with each of the characters.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It had  a great start but by the end I was just ready for it to be over.  It was a free download though - so I can't complain much!  Worth the read.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Yes a few of the dvds skipped a little but I got for such a great price I can't complain.  Thank you
1400069807|5.0|This book is a life changer.  I truly believe it should be required reading for everyone from adolescents to adults.  I am a 50 year old who has battled with food my entire life.  I felt like a failure.  Why couldn't I just stop the cravings?  Now, Mr. Moss reveals the truth.  Food companies have been chemically altering processed food for decades with the specific goal in mind of causing our brains and bodies to crave these items and to overeat when we do indulge.  I was amazed and dumbfounded by the information he reveals in this book.  Companies have actually determined a specific \\"bliss point\\" for our tastebuds and are chemically engineering food to reach that exact point which triggers binges.  The worst part is that most of this stuff isn't even food anymore.  It's just a bunch of chemicals that have been made into food like products.  I've been naive for a very long time and this book opened my eyes.  I have done further research since reading this and found several good documentaries which cover the same subject in different ways.  Food companies don't care what they are doing to us as long as their profits are made.  The medical community is making a mint off the obesity epidemic by prescribing drugs for our high blood pressure, high cholesterol and elevated glucose levels.  I can promise that after reading this book you will never look at a bag of Doritos in the same way again.  I still get so angry over the fact that this is all going on and even being subsidized by the government agencies which are supposed to be making sure our food supply system is safe.  Please do yourself a favor and read this book.  It's a bit thick but I promise you won't regret the time you spend.  It's information that will honestly change your perspective on the foods you eat and feed your family.
0399246665|5.0|Thanks, this set was just what the parents requested for their new baby.  It will be good to be read to and will be even better when he can hold it himself.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This application is perfect for catching up with whatever RSS news feed you have. This is the perfect replacement to the stock Google Reader applies application.
0399229191|5.0|Glad to get so many of Eric Carle's books to start our baby's library with wonderful, colorful and interesting books.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|my wife loves this she thinks it is the best thing  i prefer apple products my self but what can i say
0694003611|5.0|So pleased to have this one, it is a gotta have for every new baby.<br />It was easy to shop and get everything at one sitting.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|It's a great move the bluray transfer is prefect along with the remastered effects. The only thing I wish is that the box was holographic like 1.11 never the less still an amazing buy.
0694011479|5.0|Just what we wanted and will be perfect for my first grandson.  I am sure that he will have many hours of happy times
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|VERY cute game. I loaded it on my Kindle Fire, for myself of course. I says it's for children and when my grandson is old enough I'll let him play it, but until then, I am having a GREAT time with it. The graffics are awesome and the educational part is amazing. I am learning things about the ocean I never knew! And for those of us who just enjoy listening to soft music while watching fish swim, you can't go wrong here!!!
1568363931|5.0|This cookbook is awesome: I have already tried at least half of all the receipts and I loved all of them. All the lunches are below 900 calories, and most of them are even below 700. Every lunch contains minimal-processed vegetable entries. So healthy! And such a lunch makes me really full.<br /><br />I still can't fit into the timeline suggested by the author: what supposed to take 20 minutes takes almost an hour from me. But I think this is a matter of practice.<br /><br />I would recommend this book not only to bento-beginners, but also to people who are interested in Japanese cuisine. It has changed my image of japanese food, that was all about raw fish and miso soup. Most receipts from this book can be easily made using ingredients from the nearest grocery store.<br /><br />One more thing: this book is very helpful for singles, because most receipts are 1-serving, so you don't need to cook a big pot and then eat the same dish every day for a week.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|&#34;Building Your Book for Kindle,&#34; receives a five start, because the information on how to build a kindle book is simple and formal.
0812983459|4.0|It's a simple story of a man who leaves his home one morning to post a letter, initially he bypasses the first few postboxes as he is caught up in remembering the past.  Finally he walks from one end of England to the other with a letter for his dying friend, as he does he encounters a variety of characters and recaps on his own life and mistakes.  It's a beautiful and simple novel.
B004DL5K2K|5.0|Nuff said!!! The Ozzmans first album and arguably his best. This is the album to have if you have only one Ozzy album
B00499NHLC|5.0|Me and my wife loved it! It was very unique. It kept us in tense till the end. I will surely watch other series too.
B000002J09|5.0|It's Led Zepplin for christs sake. How can you go wrong with Zep!  Stairway to heaven says it all !
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|only got to play it a few times then it wanted money<br />I would rather buy the game and never spend any money on it again<br />it is a scam
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|I didn't really enjoy the book because it was really sad. Life is hard enough, I like to read books to escape. With that being said, I did finish the book.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Almost too dark and realistic. Have to keep reminding myself it's just a show. If it doesn't pick up soon I may get depressed.
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|Cant wait for the latest book in series to be released.  Loved the history of Scotland and USA and the time travel, cant wait to see what happens next to Jamie and Clare and their family in the past and in the 18th and 20th centuries. Interweaving of characters of previous books to reappear in current books, great storytelling along with epic romance.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Nice way to read my feeds. Very clean. Doesn't bombard me with ads. I like it better than google reader.
1616550414|5.0|Our teenage son is a big Zelda fan.  He loves all the trivia.  The artwork is beautiful.  You see how the characters developed over time.  The timeline of the games is explained well.  There's an exclusive manga comic included. It's a sturdy book, the pages have a nice finish, the cover is nicely embossed with gold lettering (clean edges). It was the &#34;perfect birthday present.&#34;
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love the game!!!!! I play this for hours.  I think that  seniors  would enjoy playing this game .And I am 68 it's a fun game I gave this 5 stars
B00C5ZNUCS|5.0|Ghost lost a lot of the 70's stoner edge and added more of a pop feel for this record. It always had a little bit of pop, but knowing that they've been covering ABBA and the Beatles at shows really tells you what headspace they've been in. I miss some of the metal vibes but that doesn't make this album bad by any means. Solid songs, great band, great recording.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Well I read the whole thing and will probably read the next one, but am not SUPER excited about it.  Should cost less money.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|The effects in this movie are outstanding.  I enjoy it repeatedly being a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs.  I bought the four disk combo so I could watch it in different parts of the house and on trips.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|So well written, just the right amount of spice to keep you wanting more...if only more books were written like this.  I'm a tough critic: hate misspelled words, love rich use of the language mixed with potent literary skills.  Very very well done.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Fabulous album, It's unfortunate that this style of music never gets a chance to be played on the radio and music videos. I can not stop playing this album. Great songs and tranquil music. This album brings memories of when music was meaningful
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I haven't been disappointment with any of the Dark Knight movies and this was no exception. Lots of action. Just a great movie.
B00079FUI6|5.0|We caught the 7 and 8 season and was hooked and now we orders the complete set and it's a lot to watch and frankly there isn't enought day to watch it all yes guys thesis a guy flick as well if like murder,suspense comedy all rolled into show!! Will rate this after we watch all DVD 's !!!
B00BESCJII|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was much better than I thought it would be and not as predictable as I thought it would be.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids have spent hours playing this game (that could be good. That could be bad) and really have a lot of fun with it. Easy and entertaining.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I find this app very useful and helpful. I like the larger numbers very easy to see. I would recommend getting it.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This is basically a remake of the &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34; movie that had Julia Roberts in it. I loved that movie. If you haven't seen it yet (I'm dating myself here) then you will enjoy this book. If you have seen that movie then this book is basically the same idea from beginning to end.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is quickly becoming the best author in the fantasy genre! This is an *amazing* book, and I am so excited to read this series as it unfolds. My only complaint is the wait for the next book.
0679805273|5.0|It's a children's book but i got it for all my adult friends; A great motivation book...<br />Recommended for everyone!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|&#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; is one of the best books I've read all year. I recommend it to anyone.
B00004CYXZ|1.0|the wrong version was sent - i was unable to watch on of my favorite/musicals movies of all time- No quality control at all - shipped the European version to someone in the states - bad customer service
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very easy read, kind of wish things didn't jump so far ahead in the story but that's part of what makes it addicting
B000FA675C|5.0|Excellent<br />first chapter has you so involved you can't stop reading<br />Must read other Dan Brown books they all keep you on the edge of your chair
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|but this movie is really so-so.<br />Just one of the hundreds horror or ghosts movies. Nothing is special here not bad too, it's ok.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I really like this product. Gives a very nice edges and works on all my knives. Feels a little flimsy but so far so good.
B000TEPL92|5.0|I love Richard's voice. It is so unique and cool. I listen to the album downloaded and on Pandora all the time. I would recommend to anyone who loves good music.
B001P5HI4A|2.0|If Streisand's sole intention was to make her directorial debut with this film, she should of known better and had someone else play the role. Or if her sole intention was to play the role, she should of had someone else (like Steven Spielberg or Norman Jewison) be the director. A theater director once told me you can't be your own director when playing a major role. Thsi film I believe is testiment to that fact. Unlike stuff she did previously (like A STAR IS BORN, FUNNY LADY and THE MAIN EVENT) I believe Streisand's performance in this is degrating. I just don't find her portrayal in any way enjoyable or anything else like it. The parts where she hesitates with a confused look on her face I can tell she was insecure in this role and directing at the same time. As for Mandy Patinkin, as good an actor as he is, his character really annoys me. Tne way he condascends to Streisand's male character; the way he's always putting his arm around him and tries to persuade him to get undressed in the lake scene . . . I believe Avigdore's really a homosexual. The only one I think does a great job is Amy Irving. She deserved to be nominated for an Oscar. Too bad she lost. In spite of the beautiful music and decent setting, I just don't enjoy this film at all. I think Streisand went too far with her \\"own ideas\\" state of mind. You have to draw the line somewhere. God forbid she ever will.
B000ID37KO|5.0|We had a young traveler staying overnight in our home who wanted to watch this film. It was so enjoyable, even after having watched it so many times, seeing this young person really get a kick out of it. That all, of course, included observing this young person jump on the internet to look up tidbits about the film.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show.  When purchased on Amazon the show does pause and have to reload several times.  I don't have this problem with Netflix or any other downloads so I know it's not my internet issue.  Otherwise, great product.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I was looking for a thorough explanation of what Whole30 was and how it worked and this book was exactly that!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Exciting read.  Great ending.  Finished it in 2 days.  Can not wait to read the last volume in the series.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a slightly different book than some Grisham books, but kept me guessing as usual. It still had the attorney edge but not in the same sense as some earlier books. Looking forward to next book....
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This movie show the hardship of addiction  also courage to walk away  from it the movie moved at a exciting pace
B00BKBCF38|5.0|The songs replay in your head. The first album was amazing, and as a Mercyful Fate fan I could hear the influence there and that got me hooked. Whether the lyrics fit your world view or not, there is a sincerity, regardless of their beliefs in real life that make this theatrical musical experience hard to compete with by other musical outfits. These are solid albums you can play over and ever so enjoy.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I was skeptical about this diet at first but I truly love it! Easy to follow and it makes sense! Would highly recommend it!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|This was one of the few King novels I have read that didn't scare the crap out of me. Thank God! He did a nice job on keeping the logistics of time travel for the character plausible but I am not sure I liked the ending.  I did like the glimpse of the damaged future Jake experienced but I guess to some extent it seemed over the top?  It's definitely giving me plenty to think about. As for Oswald and conspiracies...I guess we'll never really know.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Never liked journal style reads... but the first few sentences set the pace and they were entertaining. I stuck with it and glad I did.
B0052OSTOS|4.0|Most of the meditation apps I found were not free. Given that this is a free one, it was worth it for me to try. There are no bells and whistles, but with meditation....there shouldn't be!
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|I have been a Bring Me The Horizon fan since I was in the seventh grade. This album is actually the fifth album I have by them (which is why I don't quite understand why it says it's the highly anticipated fourth album). That includes &#34;This Is What The Edge of Your Seat Was Made For&#34;, &#34;Count Your Blessings&#34;, &#34;Suicide Season&#34;, and &#34;There is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It There Is A Heaven Lets Keep It A Secret&#34; and finally this one. The album art work is beautiful. It comes complete with lyrics on the inside.<br /><br />This is pretty different from the rest of their albums, but it's certainly a good different.
B000WD7CCO|5.0|The show is good for at least a few laughs...and that's for the bad episodes (of which there are few).  The good episodes (at least 90% of them) are riotously funny, and a few even tug at your heart.  Just an incredible show, for me a top 5 comedy I've even seen.  The reason I love it is that the writers take so many scenarios that you can relate to and put a funny/interesting take on them.  The characters are all so well-written.  Season 1 is a great one, and it only gets better from here.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a hilarious, emotional ride through the seasons.
0316044695|5.0|I ordered this for my son, as it's the only material I can get him to settle down long enough to read.  I was impressed with the great condition of the used book.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It was one of best books I have veered read I recommend it to anyone who likes action and a little bit of gory. I say this book should earn the noble peace prize.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|As the parent, I liked the references to old arcade games and the actor voices! Love Jane Lynch and John C Reilly!
B00966TN1Q|5.0|Excellent story.  A real page turner.  Holds your interest from beginning to end. I couldn't put it down. Good read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There's a few slow episodes but overall this is a well done show. Still hooked after 3 seasons. Gotta love the zombie apocalypse!
B006R1T40I|5.0|Bonnie is great on the guitar, all the elements were there lyrics, balance, and the soul sings through every verse from evey note.  Great production.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I luv this book so much nd I can't wait to read the next one <3  best trilogy since the Hunger Games
B008SVS3FC|3.0|I like the lyrics and the sentiment.  Something was redundent  and sometimes hard to listen to in the band.  As I write this will try a another listen.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Ane is the one best emotions in Les Miserable! She is the amazing!<br />Each song and song like talk is pretty good!!!!<br /><br />I just love it!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Folk singer, through and through. Great combination of simplicity and complexity.  Folk.  Time may have made the voice crazy craggily, but the heart and mind shows through.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love the game because the possibilities are endless. But it does require a lot of attention so you'll have to keep a good eye on it.
B00062PN6I|4.0|I owned a pair of these headphones years ago and I love them. Lightweight, good price and nice sound. Thank you
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|It is an encouraging read. No matter what we are dealing with in our life, we need to be positive and forge ahead. Even if we are the sister!!!!
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Just like I remember these classic tunes in the days of my youth..... Great music for great times never fails.
B000063DS1|5.0|This is a great compilation of the major hits of one of the greatest musical groups ever, The Band, as well as songs sung by some of the era's finest musicians and artists. Neil Young's version of Ian Tyson's Four Strong Winds is superb. Joanie Mitchell sings along with him on Helpless.  Dry Your Eyes, sung by Neil Diamond, was composed by Robbie Robertson and Neil Diamond and is a beautiful song. Look up the words and read along as he sings to enhance the experience. Bob Dylan's Forever Young is a classic, and The Band accompanies him with great music and harmony. This box set is the last recording of The Band, and it is truly a treasure. To hear the talent of masters such as Levon Helm, Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson is such a great experience. Purchase the video of The Last Waltz as well for a truly wonderful musical treat and interviews by Martin Scorsese. Talent like this doesn't come along often. Treat yourself and sit back and enjoy perfection!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|1. I like the books 2. very erotic, but also mysterious 3. not well written, like she was 15 and tried to write an essay

1439102430|4.0|I do enjoy the Kathy Reichs Temperance Brennan series.  I like that she throws in some scientific tidbits that add credibility to the forensics part of the story.<br />I liked the change in locale to Yellowknife.  I did not realize that Canada has become a player in diamond production and found that part interesting.<br />The premise of the story with the dead newborn babies was enticing and I was looking forward to some creative explanation.  I was a bit let down by the reality of the dead babies.  I just don't believe the premise happening four times without officials or people around Annelise knowing about the pregnancies.<br />This is a satisfactory quick read.  The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because this book was so much like the formula she uses in other books.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|bought this as a replacement for our dvd library at a hotel. personally never seen it but it arrived quick and in great condition. no problems

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It was difficult enough to keep me interested yet not too difficult to follow.  This game could have been a little longer, so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

B0040HO01Y|5.0|Candleford has a truth of what life is,  hard work and compassion for others<br />not so fortunate.  For what life should be.  I don't see it so much in these times,<br />I am 72 years old.  I remember neighbors helping my parents (family of ten)<br />and today it seems it is almost against the rules to help.  Sharing leftovers,<br />what you can spare.  Things from the garden, clothes offered in friendship<br />is almost considered an insult today.  More and more I see people that only<br />money assistance is enough, no one enjoys going to bed and getting a good nites<br />sleep from an honest hard days work.  Its sad.  The series is  good, it makes me<br />feel someone still enjoys the virtues of earning you way.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I was so excited to play this but it won't load says you need an internet connection so I haven't played but one day I might figure it out when I'm near my computer
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book will keep you wanting to read until you can no longer hold your eyes open.It is so awesome.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It is good and protects my kindle fire but it doesn't stand up so I guess I ordered the wrong one but I do like it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a series that will keep you reading til you get to then end.It is so awesome.I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|It is almost the same as playing bejeweled so it isn't really worth having on my kindle but i have it so it stays
1863514260|5.0|I would recommend Trish Burr's book Colour Confidence in Embroidery to anyone interested in the needle arts.  Although this book is written specifically for the needle work artist the information on color can be utilized by any working artist in other media.<br />It is not a beginners book on needle painting but she does go over the basics in the beginning of the book with excellent diagrams along with information on materials and equipment.<br /><br />The color wheel is broken into segments (cool/warm colors, complementary colors etc.) and relates to how this works in creating a stitched piece.<br /><br />Every page has excellent color photos.  Every combination of color shading has a photograph of the stitched sample along with the thread numbers listed.  There is a section on color schemes and the back of the book contains the sample projects.  These projects enforce the color theory discussed in the front of the book.  The projects include line drawings, finished color photo of the piece. stitch diagrams as well as specific color insets for visual assistance in the stitching of leaves, petals, stems etc..
B0063IH60K|5.0|Always fun when youre bored and anyone can play it. I will play when in a doctor appt or just relaxing
B00ATDOVNK|2.0|This game says its free, but then at the best part of the game, it asks u to buy more levels.  This is one of the few free-to-download games from G5, and i saw positive comments, so i got it, but less than half an hour later it was deleted.  Good game and nice plot line if u don't mind paying the extra money on this game.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|SIMPLY The best book ever written about the Pacific campaign of WWII. Thank you Sledgehammer and all the brave men and women who protect our country.
B005BGBPBG|2.0|Because once you start - you'll want to finish. I caught the first 30 minutes on HBO and then wanted to see the end. It was a for sure waste of my time. It is so cliche that I kept thinking that what was actually happening was going to be part of a dream sequence. Just don't even start watching.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Bought this for my husband who is a guitar enthusiast.  Found myself listening to the CD while he was driving and just looking at the scenary and not thinking of anything else but the music.  Exceptional piece of music and will buy more of his CDs
B000MD9UJC|5.0|Decent product from a phenomenal company.  Purchased this product roughly three months ago, and was very happy (performed as advertised).  Until the switch stopped working.  Contacted the company via e-mail, received a prompt reply (within 24 hours), and was shipped out a replacement switch, which I received within 7 days.  Keep in mind that this is an eight dollar upgrade.  And, especially at that price point, to receive that level of customer service is unheard of these days.  If I ever have need of any LED products / upgrades, I will be searching for Nite Ize first.  Great experience!
B00B52F278|5.0|This is no fairy tale with a happily ever after end to it. If you have watched from the beginning (even if you didn't know history) you should know how the ends. They gave plenty of warnings. This is an epic bitter struggle for one man that ended up with him the leader of thousands. The last season and finale will not disappoint. I loved Andy Whitfield in the role as Spartacus, but I must admit that I have grown to love Liam McIntyre's portrayal of Spartacus. For me, he is Spartacus and gave an award winning performance this season. The cast does not let us down.<br /><br />It's epic, it is bitter, it's wonderful and heartbreaking and excellent. You won't forget it.
B0068MNO4S|3.0|If you can do that, this is enjoyable. I love Shakespeare so I think the theory presented is trash, but it was still fun to watch it unfold.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I avoided this film for a long time because I expected some kind of liberal gloss on Vietnam.  I was entirely wrong in doing so.  This film goes well beyond categories of liberal and conservative.  What is at stake are primary human values tested in the crucible of the kinds of wars which carry civilizational consequences.  McNamara is unflinchingly honest in his response to excellent questions.  I cannot recommend the film highly enough and will be sharing it with my undergraduate students next fall.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is very addictive and alot of fun as well. i need to exercise my brain and this game does the trick. my grand kids love it too. quite the challenge.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My husband got this on his kindle and the kids played it all the time until i was sucked in too. I love puzzle games and this is just challenging enough to keep me entertained.
B005LAIII0|5.0|this movie was amazing, a must see.the visuale effects are amazing, but the truely amazing part of this movie is the story it's self.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I've been using this application for over a decade, I find it extremely convenient. Now that it available like an app in different formats for different OSs, I enjoyed a lot more.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Great movie. Wasn't sure what to expect before watching but I was very impressed. It is a mist see movie
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|This is a spin off of 'Knocked up'  which I didn't really like but I did like these characters.  This is a funny movie....just wasn't as good as I was expecting.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I hate zombie movies but this takes them to a whole new level. Super funny and great family movie. It is a must see
B008JD7VZM|2.0|We have 2 young children (5&7) who love to play Minecraft and love Legos.  We were thrilled to see this Lego set and purchased each of them one for the birthday of our youngest who is Lego obsessed.  We thought that a 480 piece set would be pretty impressive to a boy turning 6 until they were delivered and both sets fit in one shoebox!!  It was then I realized what the Micro World part meant.  It comes with 2 Characters and each are the size of a single wide regular lego brick.<br />Although we are disappointed we are still going to give them to the kids at the party in two days and we hope that they will be so thrilled there is really a Lego Minecraft set they won't even notice the small package.  Just not the BIG Lego set our little guy has been telling us he wanted for his birthday.  Would be great if Lego made the set in regular size  Legos.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|Our 3 1/2 yr. old son LOVES this game, setting up the &#34;blocks&#34; and pigs, etc.  Great for developing fine motor skills!
B00AATV046|5.0|It is my all time favorite Christmas movie and sorry Denzel yours just done'st hold up but  that was the script and not you. Someone that can be watched again and again.
B000WEMH3C|4.0|I have an upstairs neighbor's balcony overhanging my small outdoor deck, so I only need rain and dirt protection for the Weber. This thing should do the trick - it does not feel overly cheap or flimsy for the price. Probably would not stand up to prolonged direct summer sun exposure, but then again, nothing does. If you have any shade at all it should work fine for less than half the price of the premium model.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|gotta find out if Sam and Dean ever fix the world and their boo-boo from when they opened the gates of hell and released all those nasty demons at the end of season 2.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Very funny, clever, and loaded with awesome music! It's got a great storyline and almost all the characters are well rounded and complex. You will see something new with each viewing, a quality important in a movie you will watch over and over again.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I have to find out if the characters ever get restored to their homes and life in the enchanted forest.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is by the writer of Downton Abbey and is in a slightly different though equally gilded era. The atmosphere is marvelous and it is a whodunit with a surprising outcome. The cast is stellar—including Maggie Smith.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I must find out what happens next. I want to see if the baby grows up to become just as heartless a killer as her brother is.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|This musical is FULL of dancing,singing,cat humor,and some things are very impressive BUT if you have young children Macavity might be a bit scary,WE LOVE THIS MUSICAL!<br />'the making of cats'<br />discusses how the musical was filmed it shows the actors/actresses practicing,it has the musical history,and features interviews with some of the cast members,over all it is the BEST musical ever in the history of the world! it is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />so you should definatly watch this musical
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Even better than the last season, I can't wait til the next season, I am totally hooked, I recommend to all my friends.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is an excellent game to play whether it is to pass the time, or to flat out relax. The variety is great and the colors are so vibrant. I would recommend to everyone! Best puzzle game available in my opinion.
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|Tells a story of a distopic future in which the people are being ruled by fear (weird that analogy...) and a group of people rise up to take back the world from those fearmongers.  Not too far off from the truth when you think about it.  Epic guitar riffs, fun songs and a lot of awesome energy.
B000002MP2|5.0|Once again you can't beat that old great music, it keeps me young and alive!!, Buy it you will not be disappointed. G-Day is the best new and old and Amazon has it all very reasonable, Thanx you guys!!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Lzzy Hale is an incredible singer, and the songs are very well written.  The music is at times high energy, other times slower and moving, and occasionally high notes are hit that made my glasses vibrate dangerously...but They are awesome.
B000001DQI|5.0|Great album, I wonder a lot where all the great music has gone but as long as Amazon is around I have nothing to worry about getting my hands on the great stuff new and old,definatly would recommend to another buyer!!
B0052FDRI0|5.0|The Musical intricacies are awesome, I love Jake Pitts solos and the power that comes from each and every song.  Basically a band taking tips from some of the older metalheads, and while their lyrics aren't incredibly complex they still hit an amazing sound that can pump up your energy.
B003DT19F0|5.0|Purchased for Christmas for our grand daughter.  We were happy with the purchase of this item and would recommend it to others.
B009GEDP26|5.0|In the classic \\"They finally got together!\\" story line, this is one of the best because of the chemistry and charisma that both characters have.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|The Peter Pan DVD was purchased as a gift for our grandson and we have not given it to him as of yet.
630027120X|5.0|This is a MUST SEE film for Catholics---as it speaks to the intermingling of the Church and politicos with their own agendas.  In a way --if you are not Catholic, you may not understand----it also speaks to who is called to be a priest under the Sacrament of Holy Orders, and those who seek the refuge and structure of the life under Holy Orders (a man seeking the refuge of a  priest's life).  This is among the BEST movies i have ever seen.  Jeremy Irons is solidly a committed life; Robert de Niro is the repentant soldier who seeks the priesthood as it affords him atonement for a very seriously impairing killing.  I actually do spoilers----but not this time.  You have to see the film.  God had His Finger over this one.  The filming location purity really exists, as does the purity of the indiginous people.  'Nella Fantasy' is the music that grounds this film---the Sisters of different orders in reality call this \\"Gabriel's Song.\\"  NO SPOILER----love, maureen
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I love LastPass and for those of you who are security conscious about your accounts and passwords like I am then you can do no better.<br /><br />LastPass is easy to use and very flexible. I will say up front that I pay the yearly subscription so everything that I mention may not work for those who don't. LastPass works on all Android and iPhone's as far as I know. You can not only access your information on the web through the devices but through the mobile app as well. You can also access the website on your computer but on the computer to get the best experience download the addon for your browser because then once you login it can auto fill in login information for you.<br /><br />LastPass is totally TNO (as Steve Gibson likes to say [...]) meaning that when you give it the information and you secure that information with a password only you, not even LastPass, can access said information. This brings one caveat don't loose main password.<br /><br />From the mobile app you can access your information as well as launch websites. I know this review sounds scattered but I really do like LastPass and you cant get a better total solution for creating, storing, saving, and accessing your passwords and accounts. In this day and age that's about as important as making sure no one steals your actual wallet.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|My 38 year old son was hospitalized  with lysteria meningitis. He also came out of a deep sleep .coma. This book helped me understand his behaviour when he awoke.
B0067R0APK|5.0|So far the weather has been very accurate.  I really like that the temperature turns red when their is a weather warning. I really like that feature.
B000PC46DU|5.0|To find two of my all time favourite Asimov books in one hardback binding was truly a great find.  They are indeed the introduction to Asimov's robot and empire series.  Read on!
B000SLP4SE|4.0|If you like a lot of action and some drama, this movie is for you. I love to watch this type of movie just to have some fun and eat some popcorn.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|lol first time I played this it was so scary I almost died I screamed my sister came in and she was like what's wrong and I'm like I'm playing slenderman and she's like slenderman is scary why are you playing that and I'm like I don't know
B004WGIXX4|4.0|I've always been a Natalie Portman fan. I'm not as thrilled with Ashton Kutcher as it seems movie's he is in just don't offer him much substance in the characters.  However, overall, I'd give this a 4 for the story line. It makes for a good &#34;chick flick&#34; night movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I've read several novels lately where the author seems to be challenging me to like the novel even though I can't stand the main character.  This book has two unlikable characters for the price of one.  Gone Girl is the story of the disintegration of a marriage, and also a murder mystery.  It is an &#34;amazing&#34; puzzle box, with clues scattered all over, and it really takes off at the 51% point (I think in % now since I have a kindle).  Unfortunately, the two main characters are so deeply flawed that I found it impossible like or care about either of them.  The other characters merely fill out the story so that leaves only the puzzle for enjoyment.  The final twist raises some interesting questions on the nature of happiness and what it means to be &#34;normal&#34;, but I remain unconvinced.
B007TXS512|5.0|for now... i appreciate yor fast shipping.<br />so The title of the dvd very pleased.<br />and then I had to buy the DVD a few titles.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good read. Too much explicit description. It might be necessary for the plot but could have lived with a little less. For all gratuitous a great story and makes the reader curious to know the rest.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a good read but not as good as the first book The Hunger Games or the third book Mockingjay.
1885167776|5.0|I was curious about all the positive reviews. So I bought the book. And I'm glad I did. Although I feel that the concept of \\"The ONE thing\\" is simple and powerful, I was impressed by another aspect of the book. Which is how the concepts are conveyed. Now I realize that it's as important as the concepts itself.<br /><br />Most of the concepts discussed in the book are not new at all. But they're conveyed in a way that makes me realize how important they are. I've read a lot about the concepts discussed in this book. But this may be the only book that made me apply them. After reading the book, I started applying the concepts of \\"block time\\" and \\"habit\\" right away. (No kidding! The book is that good.)<br /><br />My suggestion is buy the book. You may feel that the book is common sense. That's OK. You job is to make common sense a common practice.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a very good story.  After reading this I just had to read the other two books of this Trilogy.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|real fun...easy to learn. but I also enjoy. card games that ar Ccg more then most. only just got it today. I'm gonna keep on playing though
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this book.  It is the best of the trilogy.  The first book was very good and the second was ok but I just loved this one.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was a killer book! I read it in two days because from the very first page I was hooked. The thing that made this book scary was that it was a very believable story and was definitely one of the best horror books I have read in a long time. I really enjoyed this book and so will you! This was the first book that I read by Blake Crouch, and it defiantly will not be the last! I was very pleased to see that it is up for an award. Good luck Blake!
B009186JYI|5.0|Fun movie covering several days in 1965 when they went to Ireland.  Boys were young and their innocence is appealing.  They really cleaned up this old 16mm film.  Really fun,
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Plain and simple. Selling the 2D separate from the 3D copy is insane. This price is crazy even for just a 2D copy. Over $30?? Sad Sad Sad  What a rip off  a HUGE rip off.<br />If you pay this they will keep doing the same thing. I cancelled my preorder. I can rent it on 2D for a few dollars. Why pay this without both 3D and 2D together like all 3D movies come? Disney your boycotted.
B00005JLET|5.0|I bought this movie for my little sister. She loves Spirited Away! She has a VHS player attached to her T.V. so she asked me to buy this on VHS for her. It was difficult to find elsewhere so I was super excited that Amazon had it available! The is sort of an anime like movie.
0062238868|5.0|This was an excellent book that I originally read before the author, Chris Kyle was killed and had been wanting to re-read it because of how interesting/inspirational it was simply knowing that people like him exist, fighting for our freedoms and doing the things most of us couldn't imagine doing. When Chris Kyle was killed I immediately ordered this off Amazon because it's just one of those books I want to have and hang onto always. Great book that everyone should read!
B002SQNM9A|5.0|I am a huge Taylor Swift fan so naturally when I stumbled upon this product on Amazon, I had to buy it! I love this holiday collection, it's very sweet and fun for the holidays. Taylor Swift is extremely talented and I love listening to this album.
1455502758|2.0|I was disappointed in the book.  I thought it would be more inspiring but it was very depressing.  I realize he was dying but I didn't think it would be so real.
B00454U1NS|5.0|If you are a Pink fan, you will love this album! It is all of her best songs compiled in to one CD. It's a great CD to listen to in the car and sing along too. My friends and I enjoyed this CD while we were in a road trip. I love Pink and this CD is full of her best songs.
B005I3PAUO|5.0|Typical Baldacci. Gripping read. Buy it. (For what reason do I have to insert so many more words and become verbose?)
B000002LFZ|5.0|* 14 rock tracks are USA hits from 1976 - 1987 of the Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham years<br /><br />* 2 bonus tracks recorded especially for this album seemed hurried and unpolished<br /><br />* I keep replaying: \\"Go Your Own Way,\\" \\"Little Lies,\\" \\"Gypsi,\\" \\"Dreams\\"<br /><br />If you want more of the bluesy British flavor prior to Stevie Nicks along with some of their post-reunion work, go after the 2-CD set. This one CD is find for the casual Fleetwood Mac fan who only knew them with Stevie Nicks in the line-up.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00006JL1Z The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac (2CD)]]
B0015RFCZ0|3.0|Loosely based on Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist, this family-friendly film tells the story of a young boy, Evan Taylor, who has grown up in an orphanage without knowing his parents. After running away from the orphanage, Evan, played by Freddie Highmore, changes his name to August Rush and begins a stint as a street musician working for a modern day Fagan named Wizard, played by Robin Williams. We are supposed to believe that Evan, now August, has an innate musical genius that allows him to hear music in the air and to pick up a guitar and immediately start playing it. He also teaches himself to read and compose musical scores in the space of an afternoon. On the basis of his musical genius, he is soon accepted into Juilliard as a twelve year old and  is asked to headline an outdoor orchestral concert in Central park. If you know the plot of Oliver twist, you can guess the outcome of this movie, as invisible forces move the characters toward its inevitable conclusion.<br />On the plus side, the movie is about the power of music, and features several heartfelt performances by Evan's father, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and by his mother, played by the beautiful Keri Russell. Victorius's own Leon Thomas provides support in the role of Arthur, the August Rush equivalent of The Artful Dodger. Although hopelessly sentimental, August Rush is the most derivative, uninspired, unbelievable, predictable movie that will ever love.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Leaves me wanting more. Can't wait to read the third book in this series and continue on with the prequel.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Any time I want to read the Bible, it is easy to access, I am comfortable to take with me where<br />ever I go.  It avails me to spend more time to read it.<br /><br />I would recommend it to my family, all my friends and associates.<br /><br />Thank you
B00APUYN0I|3.0|This movie was not for me.  I'm glad I did not go to the movie theatre to pay those prices to see it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|you run out of money quickly but its realty fun and easy to learn how to play. This game like the title suggests is a good game.
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|Lead character was hard to understand.  I did not care for the ending, good build up, but went nowhere at the end.
1476734941|3.0|I'm finding the fasting days are a piece of cake (no pun intended) but the other days I am still prone to binge. Not sure whether to continue.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|Great mix of old and new, myth and reality.  San Francisco the easily pictured setting with interesting characters.  Loved it!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's an okay game, creative changes from the original, but I didn't play it for long..  there are other games out there to enjoy, my kids love subway surfer!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hurriedly writing something here so I can go get the rest of the books. Oh and the lady who reads the audio book, well, she isn't the greatest just so you know.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I'm glad to have bought these...  It's been forever since I've seen them and they are a classic masterpiece....  And to get all 3 in one package....well, all I can say is awesome!
B009FBX5M0|5.0|Really great score, one of the better ones I've bought in a while. Really should have won the Oscar, IMHO.
B008476HBM|5.0|Every time I read this book it's as good as or better than the last. Classics are called so for a reason. Read and enjoy this book.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Transforms Diet & Purpose for running. No need to go full Vegan, you will see the benefits. And if you have an interest in the book,  then you'll have an interest in trying new, fresh plant-based foods. The lightness & energy boost from a  week with minimal meat & same running routine was astounding, but true.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Full of unexpected turns. I really wish it didn't have to end. Gillian Flynn has a Really enjoyable writing style.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|Don't bother watching this movie. If the idea of this movie just really seems that interesting to you, just watch Friends With Benefits. It's basically just a better version of this move (though not that great itself).
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Very good animation,sweet moments and laugh out loud moments too. Perfect example of Disney when they are at their best!!
B00355L2TU|5.0|I've lifted weights and done cardio in the gym for over 10 years but after having my son I had a hard time shesding the last 16lbs. Jillian Michaels workout is amazing I'm on day 12 and have lost 9lbs and 2 inches on my hips thighs and waist! Love it!

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|It is a typical Clancy novel with suspense, and good fighting against evil.  This time the setting includes our reliance on technology in everyday living and shows how much of our technology is now controlled by computers.
0802473164|5.0|Bought this for my husband and he thought it was very informative and appreciated the information.  This is a positive book with practical applications

B0073PPNE8|1.0|We couldn't make it through the film--it was a waste of 30 minutes and $1.99. I've read Frazier's \\"Thirteen Moons,\\" and hoped for better.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like game but hate pop up ads. If I didn't have to deal with the ads would like the game a lot more. But for free I really shouldn't complain.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I never saw the movie(s) of this book, because I prefer my own imaginings of the setting and characters.  Ever since my first reading of it, I have found this to be a very comforting book.  I took a hardcover copy with me to college, as a talisman of struggles that resolve into new growth and hope.  I bought the Kindle edition, but I still have the hardcover, and hope to have both on hand for many years.
B001HN6922|5.0|kid love this movie , i use for my kids and they both love it.Its like toy story kids cant get enough of this one.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Fascinating, changed my thinking.  I thought the writing was not a good as it could have been, but I really like the way the book was put together, going back and forth between friends and family and his experience.
B00275EHJG|5.0|i love this movie for my kids , this is one of their favorites . They watch this movie over and over and never get tired of seeing it.
B007MG360G|2.0|I really like the game when it works... but that doesn't happen too often! Please fix whatever bugs are keeping it from working on a kindle fire. I would buy the other doodle apps if this version would ever work right.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|...but they are not the New Kids.  Acceptable material from a group of wannabes...........NOT!<br /><br />Maiden rules all.  This video is proof positive.  Trust me, I've been to Milwaukee so I ought to know.

0345803485|5.0|All of these books are the best, if youve read them then you know what i mean. If you havent, then you need to buy all of them now and read!! Greatness :)
B003VANOFY|5.0|I like everything about this headset. Good battery life  and wireless which is so much better. Great sound quality and worth buying.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|The book stresses on frugality and avoidance of wasteful expenses. Value versus its worth should always be the guiding principle.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|It made a lot of difference under water and the package was received in a very good condition. For those who has a GoPro, recommend to get this than the red film.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I gave this movie to my sister who is a Phatom of the opera nut and she said this movie fits right in and was very very<br />good and was glad I found it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I first got this game I hadn't yet got the Xbox or Pc version.A friend said it was a great reccomended game and I was stunned at the way they made this.Great graphics.Reccomended for builders from ROBLOX and Blockland. Thanks!

B001F12J0C|5.0|Great price and great product! I got this for my husband as a gift and he loved it. He's always watching these movies every time they come on TV so I decided just to get him the complete set so he didn't have to watch the commercials...lol! He watches them now all the time. Thank you.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I just loved this when I watched it on PBS some months ago. Had to purchase it for my collection.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I cried for for everyone. I just loved this movie. I have also purchased the 25th anniversary play edition with the 1984 cast returning on stage.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|As an adult, I love the visual effects and the story, but the story and moral of the movie were also more complex than one might think.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Awesomeness in a can! Add Phineas and Ferb levels. Maybe to power their drill? Awesome game. blah just for word minimum.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Brave was a great movie! It was funny and sentimental. There is conflict and resolution, adventure, magical creatures and humor for adults and children alike.
B00C5ZORES|4.0|Hey. So, I'm writing an assignment for college about this album, but I cannot put to much of my own opinion in the article since it isn't a review, but an analysis of review. This is my personal review, but I'll try to be analytical.<br /><br />This album is modern, loud, and \\"rockable.\\" It embodies the spirit of rock and roll if not the guitar-and-drums only style of rock. The songs are varied in structure (they don't all sound the same) but Stump's incredible voice is showcased more than the instruments at some points, I believe.<br /><br />You won't like this album if you are someone who hates change. That seems to be where the biggest complaints are coming from. Still, people who began listening to the \\"punk\\" Fall Out Boy have been complaining about every successive album after \\"Under the Cork Tree.\\" I don't care what these people say, and you shouldn't either if you like the music. I don't like punk--I actually don't like their first album at all. So if you don't like punk you should still like Fall Out Boy.<br /><br />This isn't punk anymore. It's not pop, either. And, actually, it's not rock. So what IS it?<br /><br />If I had to classify it, I'd say it's alternative. Don't let that scare you off, alternative rocks!<br /><br />It's not pop because it doesn't suck. Stump (the singer) never sings something the same way twice, which is something that infuriates me about the chorus of every pop song on the radio. His voice is so unpredictable rhythmically that I can listen to the song several times in a row before I can even attempt to sing it. If you are a good singer and like this style of music, I bet you'd love to sing along to this. I can't, sadly. *cough.*<br /><br />It's not punk because it doesn't necessarily embody teen angst. Listening to the lyrics, I feel like Fall Out Boy isn't experiencing growing pains in the traditional punk sense--but rather the adult sense. They are trying to stay young and not grow old. \\"I would trade all my tomorrows for justone yesterday,\\" \\"doesn't it feel like our time is running out?\\" \\"We are wild...we are like young volcanoes\\" \\"Lets stay alone together, we can stay young forever\\" \\"We're all fighting growing old...all in the hopes for a few minutes more\\" are all both hopeful and depressing at the same time when you realize that you CANT stay like that.<br /><br />It's also about love, with many of the lyrics about the pain of leaving someone behind \\"make it easy; say I never mattered\\" and \\"I miss missing you now and again.\\" Those are just a few. If you love somebody you'll like this album.<br /><br />Overall, FOB has grown a little older, but have also gotten a lot better at doing what they do. If you grew up at all while listening to them, you'll appreciate the message, if nothing else. Hopefully you'll like the music too, though. The drum beats and the guitar \\"attacks\\" make pumping this up in your car stereo with the windows down and absolute joy.<br /><br />I would suggest buying the whole album; I would take the song ft. Courtney Love off the playlist, and after deciding whether or not you like the one ft. Big Sean, delete or keep that, then listen to the album in that order.<br /><br />If you want to save a few bucks, here are the best songs in my opinion:<br /> - My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark<br />... This song just rocks. You've already Youtube'd it.<br /> - Where did the Party Go?<br />... Embodies the message of the album, in my opinion, as opposed to \\"save rock and roll\\"<br /> - Alone Together<br />... I like this song; sounds the most loyal to classic FOB to me, so fans should like it too.<br /> - Young Volcanoes<br />... It's good. I like the parody of \\"Train.\\"<br /> - Just One Yesterday<br />... Don't let the beginning throw you off; the parody of \\"Adele\\" was a mistake, the rest of the song is...well...different.<br /> - Save Rock and Roll<br />... A little awkward at first but it grows on you. Elton John sounds bad to me, but then just remember \\"it's Elton John,\\" and it somehow fixes itself.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|These are great movies at a great price. Very happy. They are classics got to love the Bones humor and Spock seriousness.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have read all the  buzz about this book. All of my reader friends told me  you have to read it. Well they Were right I loved this book. I was sucked in and didnt want to put it down. Travis and Abby were a Beautiful Disaster together but through all of the up's and down's they find a way to aways come back to each other. you will find friendship, love, mad, jealousy  while reading, but its a story that keeps you reading.  I say its a Must read now off to buy Walking Disaster Travis' side if their story. This Author did a wonderful job writing this book.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Keeps my brain busy with hand to eye coordination and also keeps me form doing the chores I should be doing but it keeps my brain busy and interested. fun game
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Excellent 'raw' music that every should listen to. A most humble man whose music was not exposed enough to the rest of the world.
014086105X|5.0|I wasn't too sure about this recorded version when I bought it.  But within minutes, Julie Christie's reading transports you.  She captures the personalities and nuances of all the different characters beautifully.  She changes her voice, tone and accents so that each character comes across distinctly.  I could not stop listening.  Beautifully done.  Just as good as Jim Dale with the Harry Potter books and all the other fine voice actors that I have enjoyed before.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|I love the actors, the characters they play and the story! Nice computer animation! Glad we got it so we can watch it over and over!
B003R0LBVW|3.0|I had a hard time getting through this book. The characters were none too like able and it just seemed to drone on. In the end, I just wanted to know what happened. But I wouldn't recommend this book.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|The Raid: REDEMPTION is an Indonesia Martial Arts film which captures the spirit of 80s/90s martial arts films but enhances them with the cinematography, camera styles, and musical tastes we've become accustom to. A bit of a slow starter, the film sets up a simple premise: a SWAT team are given orders to capture a ruthless drug lord and attempt a surprise attack on the building he resides in. The situation quickly escalates into a fight for their very survival. JAKA, the team captain, just wants to get everyone out - while RAMA has an agenda he seeks to keep from the rest of the team. Very simple premise, ample characterization and some awesome fight sequences.<br /><br />That said, this movie isn't for the faint of heart: it's graphic - lots of violence, lots of blood with the ability to make you cringe at certain scenes (one involving a door, the other involving a ledge). The Bluray comes with the movie - no DVD copy.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about the product: The UV copy of the film is NOT in English - it is in subtitled English. It's a pain in the ass to claim through VUDU but as of last week, signing up through VUDU also allowed you to get ten free movies in addition to the Raid. Not bad. The Bluray itself is in dubbed english (which means English voice actors spoke translated dialogue - it fits quite nicely) and you can choose whether you want the original soundtrack or the retooled one created by Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park.
B008220D7S|1.0|I heard mixed reviews about this  movie and thought since Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann starred in it, that it would be hilarious.  The first ten minutes were funny, but it went quickly downhill.  My husband and I could not even finish watching it; it was more depressing than funny.
B005LAII80|4.0|I was lucky enough to see this film in 3D when it came out in theaters. The film is a worthy adaptation of the Judge Dredd comics with a script written by Alex Garland (The Beach, Sunshine). For those of you concerned that the film is like Sylvester Stallone's \\"Judge Dredd\\" from the 90s, you need not worry. The film is stylishly shot, aggressively violent and wickedly funny. Karl Urban (Star Trek, LOTR, Bourne Supremacy) absolutely inhabits the role of a morally upright fascist and puts in enough humor and wit to make the character unpredictable at times. Olivia Thrilby plays his partner, Anderson, and she does a pretty damn good job in the role and holding her own. Both leads are very believable. Lena Headey (Terminator:SCC, Game of Thrones, 300) is great as the film's villain \\"Maw-Maw\\", a brutal gang leader whose apartment complex the two Judges must face down in order to bring her to justice.<br /><br />I went in with low expectations and the film far exceeded what I thought I'd expect. It's a fun little film and definitely a must have. The 3D is pretty cool from a stylistic standpoint but over all? Great addition to comic book adaptations everywhere - you don't need to know anything about the comics to enjoy this for what it is: a solid movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wow, what an incredible ride! I want to travel there; l have so many questions for HIM. Dr. Alexander puts into words what must be an indescribable odyssey. I felt a oneness w/ him and with the universe thru his experience. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|What's not to like about this octogenarian?  I love Willie and these old songs and the instrumentals are a treat.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this show, wish I would of known about it sooner. I really like the fact that this show keeps it real and doesn't have a happy ending on every case.
B007NU54H4|1.0|Be warned.  Bought this through Amazon.  DVD quit just before the end.  After much discussion mailed it to Disney for analysis.<br />They informed me it was a pirated copy.  It was not Secret Of The Wings DVD It was Howl's Moving Castle DVD.  Don't know how this got mixed up but hope tis sets the record straight.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The writing is very childlike.  The plot is okay, but the entire book takes place in the course of one week.  In this short time frame we are supposed to believe that deep bonds and relationships form.  This book was pretty bad.  I won't be looking for the sequel,
B005LW5J9O|4.0|Author's thesis is atomism from the Roman times survived the dark ages and prevailed through the middle ages / renaissance / age of enlightenment among the intellectual and humanist circles, ultimately helping shape modern thought.<br /><br />Well written. I like the personal twist in that it follows the life and journeys of one italian scribe in his quest to locate classical texts as the structural backbone of the book.  It's somewhat non-chronological and jumps around in some cases but it's not that distracting.<br /><br />Good read - especially if you are interested in history and the cultural/philosophical aspects of Western Humanities.<br /><br />Kindle edition threw me off guard - I was at &#34;51%&#34; when I suddenly got ambushed with the end of the book.  The rest was footnotes/bibliographies/indices/etc.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great book for kids and adults. Has a great lesson,I definitely recommend this book to everyone.  Hope you found this helpful
B000FA675C|2.0|Huge plot holes, false tension, and mediocre characters.  Not much else to say, other than I enjoyed some of the puzzle solving.<br /><br />Meh.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Pretty sure I have all the Dr. Panda games now.  I love how it shows real life situations and makes them into games.  This one is a grocery store where my 3 y.o. can touch everything and not get into trouble (unlike the real store).  It does counting, item scanning, scooping out of bulk bins,  cleaning up messes, several more I can't remember.  Overall a lot of entertainment time.
B001P1MZNI|4.0|Have enjoyed listening to the great sounds and classic hits of Frank.  Count Basie's orchestra played well - as expected.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Typical Jack Bauer shoot 'em up and save the world.  But he does it so well.  I just keep wondering how all those spies get into Jack's office.
B00A1U2SVS|2.0|Enjoy all the classic Led Zeppelin recordings but found this live recording to be screeching noise.  Did not enjoy listening.  I enjoy many other rock live recordings but this one is a disappointment.
B00316DDWW|5.0|Simple, yet unique. They have carved a niche for themselves by growing beyond their influences. If you like Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Tool, APC you should give these guys a listen. Very bass and drum-driven sound I think
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Mumford & Sons provide a smooth and classy transition between rock and folk. Mild profanity in their album, but otherwise very pleasant.
030758836X|1.0|I picked up this book because it seemed everyone was all tongue wags about it and the reviews (Kirkus, Library Journal, Booklist, Publishers Weekly) were very good. The book started out OK, but nothing great, quickly devolved, and then fizzled. I can't wrap my head around why so many people think this is a wonderful book. I consider myself reasonably intelligent (Masters Degree), love to read well written books, and this one was just left me yearning for a good read. This wasn't it.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|Being a product of 60s and 70s music Deep Purple is one of my favorite bands.In my opinion this album is one of there best.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|MY KIDS LOVE THIS GAME.  THEY WOULD PLAY IT ALL DAY IF I WOULD ALLOW.  I WISH THESE BIRDS COULD BE HAPPY NOT ANGRY....
B00ALQSNV6|5.0|Great show, can be violent though, so be careful if a young one is watching. Overall it's a great show.
B005HSL626|5.0|MY KIDS LIKE THIS GAME SO MUCH..VERY BORING IF YOU ASK ME...CUTTING UP FRUIT...BUT THEY REALLY SEEM TO ENJOY IT,  GOOD CLEAN FUN GAME
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|There really isn't a better alternate. ive tried a couple others, but ended up uninstalling them. This bone's a keeper.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|MY KIDS LOVE TO PLAY THIS GAME.  IT'S GOOD CLEAN FUN THAT CAN PASS THE TIME FOR THEM WITH NO VIOLENCE OR ETC.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|very well written. had gave me more admiration to the series. i would really recommend this book to all people.
0802130208|5.0|The book shipped and arrived very quickly (slightly sooner than expected). It was listed as being in good condition, but shows little wear and could have probably been listed as very good. Everything else was as described. I am very happy with the value, quality, and speed.
B009X01ELC|4.0|I like the case, adds weight but nice way to protect the kindle.  Looks good and like the options of colors available
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Nice Job with the special features.  Casting was brilliant and continuity was worthwhile.<br />Not sure I cared for the choice of storyline separation
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great little sound machine. Ability to mix sounds is unexpected and unique, completely makes this app a cut above the competition
B00B22IJXK|3.0|I am enjoying using this app but I wish it had a section for frames.  I really wish that I could add just a little something to my photos without having to adjust the whole photo.
B0013527I4|5.0|Always played well with no scratches, no skipping, and some super awesomeness.  The price was competitive for this kind of item, for which some people were charging through the nose!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I must say when I first downloaded Fifty Shades it was a little iffy in the beginning. I drifted away from the book and came back almost a year later. I stopped reading at the point where grey had surprised steele at her job at Claytons. And once I picked up this book again ( about 3 weeks ago) I was not disappointed. I've been only wanting to know whats going to happen next, whats going to happen next. Yeah the book is a little graphic when it gets to sex scenes and also you can somewhat feel the pain ana goes thru! Its pretty harsh. But besides all the dirty parts, I get so lost in thought reading that I forget what time it is and its way past my bed time. And this is the first book I read maybe since after I got out of college which was atleast 3 years back, i think? Anyway,this week I'm almost done with Fifty Shades of Freed, less details of the sexing and more on the story line. Filled with new events and new stories which are coming in the characters lives. I had no idea I could be addicted to a book this much. I'm a little sad to that there isn't another book to read after this. But I'm proud that my money was worth it and actually making use of my kindle made me happy too!<br /><br />Can't wait to know how this book ends&hopefully the movie doesn't ruin the story!
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|This is really fun to use. Autodesk has come come up with a pretty decent program. I would get this again in a heartbeat!!!
B0049J0DC8|5.0|My grandson is 4 and he loved the movie.  He sat on the edge of his chair for most of it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Full version is a little over priced for the length of the game, but that is the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars. The graphics are great, the story line is great, some of the mini games were difficult which is nice for a change.  overall, a pretty good game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I just love the calculator.  The numbers are large.  I like the fact that you can check the process and numbes that you have use.  Its like an adding machinr without using paper.
B008QCBFHG|5.0|Timely receipt of CD and a most enjoyable recording.  I would strongly recommend this recording of Alessandro to Handel afficianados.
B000XA5K4I|5.0|Great movie! Action packed and kind of campy which is something I personally like every once in a great while.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|man I have not yet played it but I hope it will be great and I might become addicted and love it
B002U6CJCE|5.0|Following the poorly scripted/acted/directed UniSol sequel (The Return), this movie was warmly welcomed as a proper sequel loaded with everything we loved about the original plus some new stuff. And Zod knows it was better than the fourth one.
0385339089|5.0|Grisham is brilliant story teller. He weaves through the story in a simple and effective way. The genre of his are always simple, current day events. Unlike science fiction or fantasy which only has a niche audience, Grisham's novel appeal to a wide audience. This book is regarding a pre teen boy who knows just too much for FBI. He finds a lawyer of his own and proceed with the story.. Gripping. My only gripe with Grisham is he is a democrat (no issue with that), but brings that into his novels and defames Republican party. If he leaves politics out of his novel, it will appeal to even more audience.
B008IGBTX0|5.0|Great album! And it arrived on my birthday!!!!! I was able to blast it on my way to my family dinner which was really nice. It's a great party album, no joke. Even if most of the songs sound the same.

B0068RHSZO|5.0|As far as today's thriller/horror genre goes, I am fed up with watered down PG-13 movies that try to distract us from lack of gore with an overproduced plot and mediocre special effects. And I saw this movie because I'm a fan of Daniel Craig and his beautiful wife Rachel Weisz, and because I was interested to see the movie they met while making. And even though I think the above of the newer thriller/horror genre, I can tell you that is not the case with this movie. Very good movie and well acted and fun to watch. Recommend.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey, what more do you need?  Great movie, great music, great dancing, great bodies!!!  I will watch it again and again!!!
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Great movie, with great music and fairly good acting all things considered. And even better on blu ray. I wish they would make a movie of Return to Labyrinth. I could die happy then.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|What a fantastic movie. Daniel Day Lewis is well deserved of the Oscar he received. Sally Fields was also incredible. Memorable moments as well as some comical ones!! Must see!!
B001TH16DS|5.0|Great show, great season. It's interesting how much Spock changed from the beginning of this season to the later Spock we all know and love. He started out kind of smug and showing a little emotion. Just shows you how much of a progressive show this was.
B00BF11STU|3.0|It was barely entertaining to me, borderline documentary. I guess I was expecting more action and not so much of the boring paperwork stuff. It's all about the events leading up to the murder of Osama bin Laden. near the end when they actually start the attack on the compound is the best part but even that is kinda drab.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Great song. I love all things Bond (Even Die Another Day) and when I first heard this new song I thought, &#34;Yes! Finally a good old fashioned (yet somehow still new age) Bond theme. And it's by Adele! That will DEFINITELY score me points with the ladies if I start listening to Adele!!&#34; It has yet to score me any points with the ladies. Besides this song and that one about defying the laws of physics by lighting water on fire, it has mostly just annoyed me. But I'm getting sidetracked... Great song! Good going, Adele, you're not completely useless.
B0000024YL|5.0|I really love this dvd, the only thing that I was upset about was the case it came in was broke, but the cd itself was fine.  If your a lover of this music this one is for you!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great series, and an even better set. Great extras and really cool packaging. A must buy for all Alien fans.
B00947N6D8|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies!  I believe it may become a classic.  Definitely one to add to your home collection.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|Fairly good series if you can handle quite a bit of teen drama. I bought this for my brother for his birthday (He's 21... yeah...) But I'm very pleased with the set. Regardless of how I may feel about the series on a good or bad day, the set is well put together and well endowed with extras which is always nice.
B005DJREGQ|3.0|It's a guilty pleasure, lots of drama and kinda childish but its funny so I watch. Picture quality is great.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Pretty good show (even if they did mess up some major Superman canon) and this set is AMAZING!!! All kinds of extras and little things like the newspaper and an episode guide (I believe). I got it for my brother for Christmas so I'm not sure about everything in it but it seems pretty cool to me.
B004TI5N38|3.0|Good read, but not his best.  It was a bit too transparent.  Won't keep me away from the next offerings
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Had some humor, some adventure, some drama.  If you're a nature buff, you'd like it more.  Good story line and acting.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great Game and lots of fun. My neice and nephew love it too. It take while to build everything but it is worth it.
B004YXE438|4.0|Puzzles are challenging and fun. and a good way to kill time.  What's also nice is that you can download add-ons for more puzzles.

B009Z5BPZK|5.0|I got hooked on the series and had to buy the last season.  I like seeing new york and the thing the series offered.
B004EPZ0H0|5.0|This is an important book.  Engagingly and honestly, Rebecca Skloot tells a story that goes to the heart of the relationship between science and society, and the challenges we have in managing this.  Please read!
B000W01GK6|4.0|After hell froze over the Eagles without Don Felder took the LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEEN, a somewhat ambitious 2-CD set.  The end result is an often amazing collection, albeit Disc 2 overdoes the cynical political views prevalent at the time of EDEN's release.  Henley, Frey, Walsh and Schmitt carry the torch admirably with a mixture of hard-edged rockers and their trademark California country/rock ballads.<br />I really like the dark-edged cynicism of SOMEBODY and BUSINESS AS USUAL; the elegaic pathos of the lengthy LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN and the beauty of the instrumental I DREAMED THERE WAS NO WAR.  Other notable tracks include NO MORE WALKS IN THE WOOD, WHAT DO I DO WITH MY HEART, NO MORE CLOUDY DAYS, I LOVE TO WATCH A WOMAN DANCE and ITS YOUR WORLD NOW.<br />O ne cannot deny the impact the Eagles made on the music scene throughout their illustrious career and if EDEN is to be their \\"swan song\\", it does exemplify what made them so popular.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Unexpectedly touching and a very pleasant read. I truly enjoyed this book and could not stop reading. Bravo for jodi picoult
1451688091|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has the ability to tell a good story and keep your attention, all the while giving new historical information. The book is fascinating.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie, and Ashton Kutcher is a better actor than I expected. OK plot, and a so-so diversion.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|Shortest book, 3 movies.  You really don't need to say anymore.  The LOTR trilogy were some of my all time favorite movies, this is on the other end.  My wife, 11,9 and 7 year old all thought the same.  Really a tragedy; they did such a good job on the other movies.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I have used this app for quite a few months and am happy with all aspects except for addressing e-mail.The product description suggests the app will provide help with contact e-mail addresses. I find that on my phone I do get help with addresses but on the Kindle  Fire I can only send messages to addresses I have memorized, which is very inconvenient.I have seen an online discussion comment about difficulty with contact list, and I can't even find a way to access Yahoo!

B00947N6D8|4.0|not what i expected - but way fun - i expected the same old super hero stuff - i would recommend it to young and old -
1451696191|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Read the whole thing in less than 24 hrs.  I read it after the watching the movie & was pleasantly surprised to see that the movie had followed the book almost perfectly.  The book is from a teenager's point of view but I think anyone from 13 up could read & enjoy this book very much.  The themes Chbosky explores are timeless.  When I got to the end of the book, I wanted to start reading it again from the beginning b/c I loved it so much.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first, but even though I knew the basic storyline of what happens, I could not stop reading this book to see what happened next!  It was a very exciting and adventurous read.
B0058YPILY|5.0|this is one of my fav season of Criminal minds, this was such a good product that i haved recommented it to all my friends!!
B002DJZJT8|1.0|AWFUL movie..bad acting, bad story line. Cheesy and stupid. This was a waste of time and money. Take it off your listing, Amazon!

B007HACDLK|5.0|This entire series of Vince Flynn books is excellent!  I have been reading them since the first book and I usually end up reading them in 1-2 days and then I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|fun and scary game if your any kind of horror fan this is a must. only thing that would make this better is a game pad.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app is a must buy! Look for it on sale and do yourself a favor. They keep improving it. I love it. I would like to see an option for a dedicated number row at the top like the stock note 2 keyboard. Then it would be perfect!
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This is a great show. It is quirky. I love Jess. This show is great for all types of audiences and it is very funny.
B00BWKT4HW|5.0|This has more than a plot about Barney not wanting to give up his apartment \\"fortress.\\"  I was not expecting these various funny satires.  They make fun of art society and the things rich people would buy.  A small comedy of the wife/ mother spending more time on her career, leaving the husband (Marshal) feeling rejected.  And then there's Woodworthy Manor.  I'd just watch this show just for that plot.<br /><br />I am the artistic one in the family.  I still find humor in the show's satire towards art and the stereotype of art society.  Kyle Maclachlan as \\"The Captain\\" is the rich guy who has hired Lily as his Art Consultant.  I think The Captain is hilarious.  His attitude is both snobby and ignorant.  Lily changing her look from typical Lily to a contemporary art fan.<br /><br />Woodworthy Manor is a comedy of Downton Abbey.  We never see the show itself, but I liked the way Ted, Marshal and Lily were obsessed over the show.  They even had tea, crumpets and other English dishes - dishware included.  Ted would even pretend to have an English accent during Barney's open house.  I watched one episode of Downton Abbey and might see more.  But like Barney and Robin, I would have used the escape chute to leave quickly from being pressured to watching the show.  I would like to see more of this satire of Woodworthy Manor.<br /><br />I loved this show the most out of all the 100+ shows.
0062238868|5.0|I bought this for someone else. They love it so far. So, I rated it for them. They said that they would definitely recommend it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I don't think I would ever keep it in my pocket and walk around with it but if I did some hiking, oh yeah.  take this bad boy with you.  I have since bought a Arkansas sharpening stone set and that is the ultimate sharpening system, but the Smith's is a cool second.Sort of like putting a Fiero next to a Ferrari.  This is a great product!
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|I enjoyed the physic engine of this game which allowed some of the bridges to be hard to work.<br /><br />A few things you should know before getting<br /><br />A) This is a licensed copy of the original.<br />B) Its actually very easy even after tutorial<br /><br />I found this game to be quite good and very fun not just the first time but each after Get it now while its free!!!
B005HSG3TC|2.0|The stand feature doesn't work all that great, the cover is really flimsy and the hard back is starting to flake off!  it's really weird...and now there's patches of baldness on it.  Looks really ugly.  will have to get a new one soon and won't be Marware!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great educational time sink for children or adults. The graphics are very well done. The background music is quite soothing. The game play is nearly flawless.  But beware you can only go so far before they start wanting you to buy upgrades.<br /><br />Edit 5/18/2016 They added this game to Amazon underground so you can now play 100% free here ---&#62; [[ASIN:B0141E1PKE Nemo's Reef]]
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is an awesome game.It has dragon lover's name all over it.I work the device on my kindle fire and I feel it is easy to play.
B00CE6E6B2|5.0|Finally a little big city for the kindle. I have been waiting for this game since I figured out I could play apps on the kindle. This is a recourse management based game kinda like farmville or simcity. You keep building better and better things while replacing your old ones in the goal of having the best running / looking city among your friends. The graphics and game play seam to be seamless at this point. The only downside is people who choose to pay will have a decided advantage as they can complete missions faster and with less work. That has never stopped me though and I highly enjoy this game and am so happy I am now playing it on the kindle!<br /><br />Take my advice and get this game now!
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show leaves you feeling almost uncomfortable yet you don't want to miss a minute.  Spooky but not so spooky that I can't watch it alone.  Very creative.  Prefer Season 1 story line over Season 2 story line.
B00B22IJXK|2.0|I grabbed this for my wife, who is a semi professional photographer. She is always looking for new tools to play with. We found this app to be very sad for one that is suppose to cost money as there are many drawing/ photo editing programs out for free that have better functionality and options.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Simple and easy to use.<br />Allows you to share your artwork.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very limited functions.(seriously there isn't even an undo option)<br />Very very basic photo editing.<br />Bad layout<br /><br />Just so you know:<br />Blatant copy of Avairy.(you can get the real version free also)<br /><br />I got this app as the app of the day. It was a mistake even being free. As i wasted over an hour playing around on it. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS!!! as its free if you want it get it now or better yet get [[ASIN:B006IX3BHM Photo Effects Plugin by Aviary]] as its what is being copied here.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I like to read descriptions of books and then if they sound interesting to me, I purchase them.  Then I wait a while to read it just so I can be surprised which book I am reading as to the plot.<br /><br />When I started reading this book I initially thought I might have made a mistake only because the main characters were teens in high school.  Not that I'm opposed to reading about high school kids, but the plot needs to be good and the characters need to be well written to keep my attention and not feel I am in the mom in the middle of a teenage discussion in my car.  The book quickly grabbed my attention with the characters.<br /><br />I have to say Sky and Holder were extremely cute and very mature for their age.  But for what they've been through in their lives, it explains it.  I loved their chemistry and they were darn funny together.  Once I started reading, it was something I couldn't wait to get back to.<br /><br />In not trying to give away the plot in any way, Sky is a sheltered girl who lives with her mom, and there is no technology allowed in their house. No phone, tv, internet, nada!  Sky has been  home-schooled all her life, but she begs her mom to allow her to attend her senior year of high school at the public school where her best friend goes.  She has a sole-sister of a best friend who lives next door to her.  Her friend is a free and easy kind of girl....literally.  Which kind of leads Sky to be put in her same category.  Sky is pretty tough and sarcastic!  I loved her!<br /><br />Dean Holder is the bad boy who also has a less than desirable reputation around school.  Once you get to know him and see what makes him tick, you'll love him too.  I had to question why guys weren't like him in my high school. hee hee  Needless to say, he's not all of what rumors seem to be about him either.<br /><br />When you get Sky and Holder (Dean) together you can't take your eyes off the page because they work, even when they've got issues.  There are twists and turns, and I can't say that the book had huge shocks.  It's not about the WHAT??? I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING that made this book great for me. It was the characters and a good story with them.  The only bad thing is the book had to come to an end.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best free calculator app yet. No instructions needed. I have been using calculator apps for a few years now &amp; think this is outstanding. Simple and intuitive.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The book is wonderful, dealing with a relationship that is great and introspective.<br />It is difficult to keep my interest, but this book did.
B005LAJ212|5.0|It leaves me wanting more every episode i watch. I am impressed with the plot and storyline. the acting is great and their outfits are SEXY!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I've been a fan if Lindsey Sterlings music for a hole now, following her on her YouTube channel and concerts. I'll say that her style of music is very unique and creative, I do lover the style of how her music is played. If you like the violin an have a taste for some New Age music as well I would highly recommend this album.
B007THA4FI|1.0|There was so much &#34;F&#34; bombs in the first chapter that I couldn't read any further. Very disappointing. I expected better.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have this on my IPod and it doesn't always work right and its so small. I was so excited to get my Kindle HD and the app works great on it.<br />Saves me from dragging out the laptop. I haven't had any issues with it. Just wonderful.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun and addicting game. I love the graphics. They've also fixed the original problem of it running slow on older devices. bravo!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|I have seen this movie numerous times and every time it is just as suspensful as the first. Family and friends all agree that Leonardo deserved an award for his performance which was outstanding!
B00555X8OA|5.0|In my opinion the book is brilliant.  You can learn much more than just the differences between rational and intuitive thinking with all their implications. Additional plus for me is the way the book is written - it's so much more enjoyable when a geek with a sense of humour writes about something he is passionate about:)
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|this is a pretty good workout  if you want to exercise the body along with the mind, Takes a bit of getting used to and Wii is a bit funner but it was free and it's better than staring at a com;puter you have to lug around on the ground with you!
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I liked this one although it was not the best novel I have read by sparks. As always I was guessing all the way to the end. He has a way of capturing his readers.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Not my favorite angry birds and I've found it to be easier than some of the other games but it's lots of fun to try to conquer and even have my 93 yr old father playing the Rio game. good times for all levels

0143038419|4.0|I loved the book. I loved her style of writing and adventuring into foreign lands. I found it both entertaining and thought provoking. Makes you look at your life and how you think.
B000G6BJS0|5.0|I find Mariss Jansons' Shostakovich interpretations to be as strong as any. This set is marvelous, with beautiful sound and a booklet containing information about the symphonies and Jansons' interpretations of these. I was somewhat wary to order this set after reading about other buyers' problems with Disc 6, but I played that one right out of the box and found it to be of splendid sound quality. It looks as though EMI remedied the problem.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|All of her best songs are here. I'd almost forgotten how many she's had. This collection reminds you why she's been one of the biggest and best singers of the past 10 years.

B004H1YH66|5.0|John Milius's [[ASIN:B00509KXYO 1982 film adaptation]] of Robert E. Howard's [[ASIN:0345461517 Cimmerian warrior]] has, despite its questionable overall quality, has managed to gather a cult following over the decades, no doubt largely attributable to the international superstardom of its lead actor, one Arnold Schwarzenegger. In my opinion, another major contribution to the film's reputation rests in an area often overlooked by the mainstream: its score, composed by Basil Poledouris, a longtime friend to Milius who went on to have a substantial but sadly-truncated career working with other directors like [[ASIN:B000VD5I94 Paul]] [[ASIN:B000UAFDP2 Verhoeven]] and [[ASIN:B001AII4SQ John McTiernan]] before succumbing to cancer in 2006.<br /><br />While Poledouris wrote other very fine works later in his career, including the epic mini-series Lonesome Dove, I believe that Conan the Barbarian is his magnum opus. Much like John Williams achieved with Star Wars, Poledouris structured the score in an operatic fashion, embedding the narrative within the music and maintaining a strength of composition so that much if not all of the music stands quite well on its own apart from the film. But while Williams filled his Star Wars scores full of Korngold-like flourishes that support the lighter atmosphere of those adventures, the more brutal and raw world of Conan required that Poledouris's music reflect this with a more focused and muscular sound.<br /><br />He delivered in spades. The opening \\"Anvil of Crom\\" plays like an overture over the forging of a new sword, its syncopated rhythms and percussion and simple harmonies conveying the primitive nature of this world while the brass imbue a sense of honor and heroism. Much of the opening twenty minutes of the film has no dialogue, yet Poledouris's music propels the narrative along effortlessly through the shattered serenity of \\"Riddle of Steel/Riders of Doom\\" to the enslavement and coming-of-age of our hero in \\"Column of Sadness/Wheel of Pain.\\" It's an absolutely stunning sequence of music, among the very best ever written for a film. And that's only the beginning. From the wondrous ambience of \\"Atlantean Sword\\" to the charm of the \\"Civilization\\" theme, the romance of \\"The Wifeing\\" to the pageantry of \\"The Kitchen/The Orgy,\\" and not least the building tension and brutality of the \\"Battle of the Mounds,\\" Basil Poledouris wove a musical tapestry that frankly transcends the film for which it was created. Conan's score is, without question, among the very best written in the past forty or so years.<br /><br />Basil Poledouris's epic has had a spotty release history over the years. An LP program of the original soundtrack recording featuring most the score's highlights (as well as the film's opening narration, performed by Mako) was released concurrently with the film on vinyl and later on [[ASIN:B00008O89K CD by Milan Records]], with an [[ASIN:B0000014T1 expanded program]] approved by Poledouris himself later released on Varese Sarabande. Unfortunately, the original recording has some caveats. While supervised and conducted by the composer, the film's budget made it necessary to record in Italy with the Orchestra & Chorus of Santa Cecilia, a smaller ensemble than Poledouris had originally envisioned to perform his music. The recording was not made in an ideal facility, quickly and on the cheap, and Poledouris had to modify the original orchestration to account for not only missing instruments but also performance issues. On the positive side, these realities lend the soundtrack recording a rawness that supports the filmic narrative; on the opposite, they don't necessarily make for an ideal listening experience. Eventually, in 2012, Intrada Records released and remastered the complete soundtrack recording (along with the LP program) in a [[ASIN:B00ADW4I9O 3-CD set]] that is, by all accounts, a definitive representation of the original recording.<br /><br />However, from having listened to both of the Milan and Varese albums and samples from the Intrada, I confess a fondness for the [[ASIN:B004H1YH66 Prometheus release of the Tadlow rerecording]], performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra & Chorus and conducted by Nic Raine. Conducted in 2010, this release reproduces nearly all of the complete score of the film, reconstructed to Basil Poledouris's original orchestrations, and performed by a substantially larger and better-rehearsed ensemble than the original soundtrack recording in higher quality digital sound. The interpretation of the music, while not precisely the same as the Poledouris recording, is faithful in spirit to the original and occasionally, for my money, bests it; \\"The Orgy,\\" in particular, achieves a grandeur here far superior to the film recording. Also valued is a track from Poledouris's sequel score, \\"Chamber of Mirrors,\\" that is given a wonderful performance (a rerecording of the entirety of this latter score has also been released by [[ASIN:B006TF71TS Prometheus records]]). I'm not saying that this new recording renders the original unnecessary; as the original and the only recording of this music conducted by the composer, it is irreplaceable. But I do feel that the Tadlow rerecording of Conan the Barbarian is a more enjoyable and more musical listen than any version of the original soundtrack, and I recommend it as a superior album in that regard.<br /><br />Whichever version you choose to purchase, no enthusiast of film music should be without Basil Poledouris's masterwork in his or her collection.

B009ZXT4BY|1.0|there is no point of playing this game, you can not win and it just goes on forever. It gets boring after a while.
0307352153|5.0|I don't say this about many books.<br /><br />I wish I had the money to be able to buy 'Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking' for everyone in my company. I wish I had the money to buy this book for everyone at my church. Shoot - I wish I had the money to buy a copy for every family in the country.<br /><br />'Quiet' dispels the myths about both introverts and extroverts. The first section discusses some of those myths, along with assumptions that people make about people's desires to be in social settings. I was amazed at the work environment that's described in the book is very similar to some work environments I've encountered. And Susan Cain hits the nail on the head in discussing how these efforts to encourage collaboration really do very little to encourage real collaboration, primarily because people don't really pay attention to the difference between extroverts and introverts.<br /><br />After discussing the disconnect our society has with introversion, Cain focuses on science behind these two basic personality types. She talks about the findings from different studies over the years and the conclusions that could be drawn from them. While not exactly my favorite section in the book, knowing the biology and the psychology behind introversion and extroversion certainly helps clear things up. And it prepares the reader for the final section, which discusses what we can do with all of this knowledge. How can introverts navigate the world dominated by extroversion? How can extroverts and introverts peacefully thrive together? Quiet gives some great suggestions.<br /><br />Like I said in the beginning, I wish I could give this book to everyone I have met. It could start a revolution. A quiet revolution. I don't say this very often, but you need to read this book. Your church leaders need to read this book. Your coworkers need to read this book. Your spouse needs to read this book.<br /><br />Yes. It's that good.<br /><br />Disclaimer:I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Don;t understand why this movie did not get more credit - it's at least as good as SIlver Lings Play Book which was over hyped to no end
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Who would have thought a novel that included lots of engineering estimates and approximations would be gripping?  The creative jury-rigging to survive on Mars showed a lot of thought into space gear and survival on a hostile planet with limited resources.  This is a space story that a person of today can relate to.  This is Mars in 40 years or less.  Sometimes the pacing was inconsistent - jumping forward in long stretches of time, and then drawing out other scenes, but it kept things moving, I loved the sense of humor of the main character.  There were a few, genuine laugh-out-loud moments.  Buy this book.  You won't regret it!
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My 4 and 7 year-old sons absolutely love this movie. They have watched it at least 40 times and after buying the movie at least 3 times, I decided to purchase the downloadable version so they can watch it on their iPad! #smartmom#

B000FA675C|5.0|I think this is Dan Brown's best effort to date.  Clever use of &#34;historical&#34; info and speculation with a good detective story.  If you suspend your disbelief and just accept his made-up &#34;facts&#34; as true, the story can be quite convincing.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The reason is I couldn't put it down and read the first go round too fast.  Compelling to get the feel to be in on the action to bring down Bin Laden.  Thank you to all the men and women who defend this country.  Thank you seems a little lame, but you guys are the best!
B007REV4T8|2.0|If Bond isn't dead, maybe he should be which is how this installment starts out.  I swore I'd never watch another of the new generation Bond films after the bleak \\"Quantum of Solace\\".  However, I was lured back by the promise of a return to the \\"old\\" Bond style with \\"Skyfall\\" and when they rolled out the iconic Aston Martin DB5 from \\"Goldfinger\\" they had me.<br /><br />The franchise is still broken, though this 007 adventure is the best of the three Daniel Craig films.  The new Bond still lacks the wit and humor of old, not a double entendre to be seen within miles of this script.  Not much of a story, the villain not too scary, virtually gadget-less (a PPK with palm print recognition and a not-so-small radio transmitter), and then there's the car.  The current franchise clearly hates the 007 cars; they were quickly destroyed in the beginning of the previous 2 stories.  This time when Bond rolls the DB5 out from a storage unit and you hear the Bond theme you're thinking good things are coming...then again, maybe not.  Other than joking with M and fiddling with the ejection seat switch and later deploying the bumper mounted machine guns against the bad guys (with the car parked) he merely takes M for a leisurely drive through the Scottish countryside.  Supposedly they're hiding from villain who's out to kill M but once the get to Bond's remote boyhood home they make no effort to conceal or camouflage the car and just leave it parked out front.  All manner of elaborate booby traps are made but they don't do anything with the car, I thought spies were all about deception?  They say at the end that \\"James Bond Will Return\\", sadly I don't think that I will.

B0079XPUOW|5.0|My husband listened to this book first on Audible, then kept telling me that I needed to read it. We got a chance to listen to it on an impromptu road trip we took this week. We both have different tastes in novels, and this book appeals to both our tastes.  I can't say that it is &#34;light reading,&#34; because it really has some profound things in it to think about. But it is also NICE to really laugh out loud when experiencing a book. If you are even a casual SF fan (that would be me), you will enjoy this book. If you are a serious SF fan (that would be my husband), you will listen to it, read it, then listen to it again with a loved one. I am recommending this book now to specific people I know, and I hope they will allow me to share it with them too. Seriously, read this book. (If you are opposed to F bombs, there are a few in here).
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I did not finish reading the book as I found the scene a bit repetitive half way down the book. I wanted to know the morale of the book since it was much talked about. Now that the movie had won many prizes and good reviews, I thought it would be a good chance to learn more about it. Yes, I was not disappointed, and I was glad to have watched it.

B009UNH0EM|4.0|The proprietary connector on some of the Plantronics headsets is a little irritating, but their headsets work well, so I guess I'm willing  to put up with the hassle of keeping track of special cables.<br /><br />I keep one of these in each of my cars and one with my laptop, just for emergencies.<br /><br />If you're a heavy-duty headset user, I highly recommend their &#34;charge case&#34;. It has its own battery, is small enough to fit in your pocket, does a great job protecting the headset, and recharges both the headset and itself pretty quickly. As an added bonus, it has a standard micro-usb connector, so no special cable is required. When I'm at my desk, I keep mine plugged in, then just drop my headset into the case (a very easy one-handed operation) for a quick recharge when needed. When I head out the door, I grab the whole case and go.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and recommend it.  I love David Baldacci so I was not disappointed.  It's a good book for his fans.
B00B22IJXK|2.0|I'm just not impressed with this app because it is extremely basic and there are way better applications out there. Some examples are Picasso, Sketcher by Autodesk (especially!), Picsay Pro, Colorbook and more. I will even update this list some more in a bit so stay tuned. I am NOT saying this program is bad it just is so basic that I don't think charging for it is fair and even as a free app of the day there are better programs ... and that makes it a waste of space on my device, anyway. If you, Dev, want to sell this program then you need to compete with the other apps that are for sale and it needs to be as good as they are-- or better. This program just isn't up to par, mainly due to the sheer lack of tools.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This one surprised me.  I picked it out because I like sci-fi action movies, but wasn't expecting much.  I was more than surprised and not quite sure why this didn't get more praise and press.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|The CD has lovely music. It is a pleasure to listen to every band. My husband and I both enjoy it and listen to it frequently.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Movie was well done, but I had trouble with some of the dialog.  It went by too quickly and was soft enough that I missed the words in several places (end of sentences).
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Little on the boring side. I expected more. Good history lesson though... I expected more from this movie, the history buff might enjoy it more.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I bought Wreck-It Ralph to enjoy with my 4 year old grandson.  What a delightful tale for all of us.  Good message against bullying, being an outcast, and it is fun.
B0090SI460|5.0|Best movie ever. So glad it came out in 3D. And the digital copy is a dream come true. Now my iPod is a door to scream through.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|The costumes and scenery are wonderful.  The story line, great.  Even though you know what will happen, the story really gets you into the period and it eye opening.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Excellent story, would make a good movie. I enjoyed this book very much. Looking forward to book two in the series!
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Very enlightening to the brutality served on these folks by Hitler and his armies.  I was very interested in this writing since I had never read it and heard so much about it.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|My 34 year old son who lives in my basement loves this app and asperagas he is single and gives out free hugs. I love this app and my son.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good movie, obviously a little violent! Good story and action for someone that doesn't read the books. Looking forward to the next one now.
0061906220|5.0|We LOVE this book!  It was/is a favorite of my 2, now 3 year old. It was even the theme of her birthday!
B0012GMVQC|4.0|I've always loved JEFF beck and I lost my old CD so this is a replacement. One of his best.
B000UR9T8W|4.0|Spiderman 1 and 2 are awesome, but the 3rd one was disappointing. but for the price it is worth this set.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Bought as a Christmas present for my daughter I found that although the music wasn't The Beatles it still exuded the same emotion, if not more, with the cinematography. I would highly recommend.
B008KE3960|5.0|Its fun and its a defence game except its with planes u should download .....<br />My friend said it was boring to him but this is a fun game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is a lot better than just regular temple run<br />there is a lot more obsticles and its a lot more fun<br />but we need more characters!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love this series!  Reminds me of a book I read (The House at Riverton).  I'm hooked on the intro credits and have even downloaded ringtones from the theme song.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead, has to be one of the best tv series ever. The writing for this show is great, the actors are awesome. Most series draw you in for a season and fall apart. But not the Walking dead..it keeps you at the edge of your seat. Awesome special effects, and make up. All around just a great series.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I like this app, but you can't use it for actually listing the product- at least I haven't found a way. You can use it to keep an eye on the items that you're selling or planning to bid on, but that's about it. It could have a bit more efficiency, but it's free, so I can't complain too much.
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|It sounds like an entire album full of the same song.  Uninspired, unmelodic with too much rap and not enough music.  Yecch!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Well written with great detail but fast moving. Obviously well researched. It sheds an interesting light on the German Air Force.
B003ASLJMW|5.0|A retired fighter pilot is called on the steal a plane from the Russians.  He's got the guts, the knowledge and love of his country to do the job.  He proves he's up to the challenge.  It has terrific action scenes.  Clint Eastwood will not disappoint his fans in this one.<br />The action is not interrupted by side stories of romance.  It's just plain drama all the way through.  It shows how good people ( the scientist) make the ultmate sacrifice for the good of all people.  If you like Clint Eastwood and good action drama you'll love this movie.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|He great app just like diamond dash on fb well it is and even plays with your friends and family members and its free
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play the game during my breaks at work. At night it helps me fall asleep. It is very addictive.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A story of individual courage and honor with some excellent historical insight. The fog of war is lifted and two men renew a kinship forged in the warriors code.
B000XJMTUW|5.0|This has got all his good early gritty down to the bone material on here from subterranean homesick blues to Maggie's farm an Gates of Eden....if you don't own you need to.
B00821OW8K|5.0|The series offers great actors, incredible acting, believable characters and a really good story line. Almost every episode leaves you on the edge of your seat. Anyone who loves science fiction will enjoy Falling Skies. I watched both seasons on Amazon Prime over the course of 3 weeks and I cannot wait for season 3 to come out this year.
B008602KQI|2.0|Don't get me wrong on the rating for the movie, because i loved the book. But this isn't a rating on the book, its a rating on the crappy film that features crappy fire, over exaggerated hairdos, cute little doggies that try to eat the main characters, low adrenalin rush, a creepy fat dude who hates underdogs, a creepy skinny dude with a shave that makes his face look like a freaking race car, a hardly malnourished girl who lives among an extremely starving population of untouchables, and a hardly malnourished boy who's secretly in love with the hardly malnourished girl.<br /><br />It may sound like it, but I'm not attacking the actors. The acting was actually good, the fault lays with the movie producers, the director, the stylists, and the artists. They are the ones who failed. I thought that the setting year was like 3000 or something, after WW3, not 1985. I understand that funding for movies are limited and that added to that the economy is weak, but this movie sucks even given those boundaries and limits. When Katniss is swirling around in her dress you expect a burst of epic forest fire to engulf her as described in the book, instead you get a pitiful flame that would have a hard time even browning the plastic dress. Common, would it have been that hard to pay an extra what? five bucks to make that particular flame a little better so that Katniss can actually qualify as \\"the girl on fire\\" throught the rest of the story? Not to mention, Peeta and Katniss are like the only healthy people who live in District 12. Everybody else looked like they came straight out of central Africa (save for their pale skin)which is what they should look like. It would have made sense to fatten them up later in the movie after they've been living the good life for a while, but not at the beginning of the film. I think that in the whole movie my favorite character was Katiss' mother because she was the only one who seemed to be well adapted from the book.<br /><br />I know that thenext Hunger Games film is coming out soon.... and they better do the second book justice. But in a retro-like story universe like that I highly doubt it.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|I like to think that I'm very bright and can engineer like no other.  However, I do not have the formal education and this fun little game reminds me of that.  It's a humbling experience to say the least.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|I did not like Tree of Life, and absoultely do not like this movie. Boring with no explaination. I like more of a conversation in my movies.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Having only ever seen the movie, I decided to pick up the book. Couldn't be more happier that I did!! So much more And such a great story!! Already looking forward to rereading it!!!

B008XG1X18|5.0|Love that I can find whatever I'm looking for easily! DIY &amp; Geek are my favorite sections &amp; I also really like the search feature. Pinterest on my KINDLE FIRE is the best!
B00406TRU4|5.0|Wish you had season 5 available. Too expensive for what you can get for free on Net Flix.Thank you. Again
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldnt wait to pick it up and read every day. The only negative was at the end I wish I hadn't read the authors notes until later. It seemed to take away from the ending where I usually want to just sit and think about the book. But the book was awesome!
0446547573|5.0|This was really a good book!  I don't want to give anything away but it was oh so SURPRISING too!
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I love the series, and I maintain the fact the books are far better, but this wasn't that bad.  Ending sucked a bit, but kept true to the book.
B004LROUNG|5.0|It was exciting to read one of Grisham's last two books when I realized it was as good or better than his first two. John Grisham is back....my favorite mystery writer!
B000SX1H6U|1.0|Worst Amazon experience ever. The product that was sent was not the promotional item pictured here. Instead it was just the regular album. I am very upset and dissapointed and felt I was taken advantage of.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I can't get enough of Breaking bad. It's addictive needless to say. I can watch it over and over and never get tired of it.
B000ITF86E|5.0|Actually I was ordering this dvd to replace my damaged copy.  I ended up in the TV library by mistake and would like to remove it from the library and get my money refunded.  I tried to do this on line but was unable to delete the order.  In the mean time I figured out how to order the dvd and completed the order which I should recieve on the 18th. Hope you can help me to resolve this matter.
0812550706|5.0|Great book that keeps you engrossed. Makes you look into the human condition and it's future. One of the best fictional books I have ever read.
B008393Q2O|5.0|I like this app because it does what it should without a fuss.  It is easy to understand, and once you create a note it is easy to find it later.  There are options to color the notes and change font, etc.  I don't get into all that, all I want is a place to stick reminders so I can pull them up later, I don't need a database or fancy file system.  This app fit the bill
B004TRKH9O|5.0|The Origin of Ambient?<br /><br />Appearing in 1972, this album may be the beginning of the genre. It is Sound, not Music. To say it takes your mind out into the far reaches of the galaxy would not be farfetched. More probable than improbable. What does the galaxy sound like? Static? If humans can imagine the sound this may be what they hear.<br /><br />\\"Time\\". The album's title is a good description of what you will hear. Slowly making its way along smoothly through its hour and fourteen minute duration, there seems to be no beginning and no end. It just seems to start and stop. Always droning but never boring, this is an album meant to played from start to finish.<br /><br />`Birth Of Liquid Plejades' starts it off with a dominating drone. After a while this turns into a more peaceful drone. After more time it builds into something along the lines of gothic prayer.<br /><br />Where the first track placed us in orbit, `Nebulous Dawn' leads us out into deep space. The sounds of alien lighthouses, what 20th century humans called pulsars, can clearly be heard. If one listens closely they will also hear the interstellar traffic that these alien beacons are guiding. Space is a busy place when it comes to trading interplanetary goods.<br /><br />The droning and pulsations of `Origin Of Supernatural Probabilities' could be the sound you hear while being in the presence of The Maker, or some other worldly hive of constant creators.<br /><br />With `Zeit' we seem to reach our destination, a truly alien planet. It has parts in it that are reminiscent of 1950's science fiction movies. Electric running water and perturbed parakeets surrounded by a weird hollow vibe can be found here. Echoes of unusual sounds come at you and if you ask me, the high registers in this recording are distorted. And after all this time, it suddenly ends. It is just over. Sorry guys, ran out of tape.<br /><br />It is hard not to give this album 5 stars, as it sets itself so far apart from the norm. The thought that anyone would buy it let alone listen to the whole thing makes it quite a gamble to manufacture and put on the market. The record company was as much a futuristic thinker as was the band.  \\"Zeit\\" was a trend setter ahead of its time, a time that still seems to be far in the future.he thought that anyone would buy it let alone listen to the whole thing makes it quite a gamble to manufacture and put on the market.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderfully entertaining and suspenseful.  Just about everything that can be said about this has been between Amazon reviews and many others online (Wall Street Journal is how I discovered this book).  Read it, and then read the rest of them too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I chose this rating  because this tv series show is awesome! It's my favorite of all &#34;zombie&#34; shows including movies! It's more 'realistic' like I could actually imagine myself there and it kept me on my seat! I watched the first 2 seasons on Netflix so I had to find the 3rd season! The special effects in these shows are amazing! And I love watching them on my amazon, the streaming is smooth and loading is fast! I would definitely recommend this to all my friends and family!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I read some early reviews that didn't like this one as well as the others, I found it just fine..........a good action adventure set in old London and Downey is great as Sherlock.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Read this to my grand children.  They loved it!  We'll read all of the Chronicles of Narnia!  I love it!
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|Gets attention to traffic  of children. Their courage is an example of what the drive to survive can do even as children try to escape violence that they do not deserve. No child should encounter this or other abuse.

B00BQJTHYY|5.0|Great instrumental performance from a metal band, unbelievably orchestral, undoubtebly the best metal cd to own this year. Go getit
B004EPYZP8|5.0|There are a small handful of movies I don't mind watching multiple times, whereas most movies are good for only one viewing.  This is a movie I know I will be watching again.  I already have a daddy/daughter date set up for my second viewing.  When my wife finishes school and finally has more time on her hands, I know I'll have another viewing.  I have the book ordered too, and I'm looking forward to its arrival and reading.  Usually the books are better than the movies, but this is an excellent movie.  You will be entertained, thrilled, surprised, and satisfied when the end finally rolls around.  If you like John Grisham's lawyer movies, you should enjoy this one.
0062082353|4.0|Excellent, easy to relate to and to understand.  Great book one of the best I have purchased for a long time.
B008Y73940|5.0|I thought the movie was well done and probably closer to a real life situation than we'd like to think.
0525953728|5.0|I liked the book found it very interesting and could relate to it.  I think anyone with previous<br />military service and relate to much of this.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|With such an interesting story line this movie is disappointing... lacks spark of good character development. The acting was over done or just plain bad
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|when I got this app it was just hard to get money so I removed it :/ hope u have fun tho
B00BJS7LHC|1.0|Well, if you like racist garbage with a ton of blood...<br /><br />...then this is for you.  It is basically gore-porn with a slathering of bigotry thrown in for good measure.  Luckily I was spared having to pay for it since a friend rented it and wasted his couple bucks.  Still wish I had those couple hours back.

B001TCHDPS|5.0|I love this guy.  I can't believe that he was not popular in the US.  The music he writes and records is timeless.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read the hunger games series for the first time almost two years ago. Since then, I have read through at least three more times and it gets better each time. The characters are so real and relatable. Suzanne Collins is a brilliant author. I would recommend this book to anyone who wanted a meaningful, yet enjoyable read.
B00BJS7104|5.0|Jamie's performance was wonderful!  Christoph Waltz, excellent! There was excitement and ACTION throughout this modern day western. To die for the cause, Great movie. I give it five stars
B008XK69S6|3.0|Really wanted something to play wma format files on my Kindle fire. It seems my Kindle fire only plays mp3 files. HD Player did the trick. I am sure N7 mobile is okay anyway for the right uses.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game... you can go against your friends to see who can get the higher score. Every time you update it you get a new scene with cooler graphics, and its an amazing time spender when your bored. So addictive too, I just cant put it down. I highly recommend this game
B008D37J6O|4.0|I wanted an app that would play my wma format files on my Kindle fire.  HD Player did just that. The volumn could be a little higher since I am mildly hearing impaired but I can hear it good enough. Glad I downloaded it but I will be ripping my CDs to computer in both MP3 and WMA for now on, :-))
B004UPANGM|5.0|Great classic comedy horror, dont miss it, early sam raimi and bruce cambell are fantastic, pre cg special effects. Love it

B001HN69B8|4.0|It is a typical &#34;Terry Gillian&#34; movie. What else can I say? Go into it with your mind wide open and get ready for anything.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|Artsy movie.  Hard to follow at times, but for some reason it keeps your attention.  It is OK, but it is not my taste.
B000FA675C|5.0|Love the twists and turns of a mystery while those mysteries of the past creep into the story of the present?  Then read the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown.  Excitement and adventure await you. See if you can solve the mystery before the professor can!
B004JQN364|5.0|Another awesome warrior \\"mutant\\" type figure from the Papo-France fantasy collection (visit papo-france dot com to view their entire catalog). I now have this figure plus the [[ASIN:B0036MDNW6 Papo Ram Man]], [[ASIN:B001PIJEBW Papo Crocodile Mutant]], [[ASIN:B001LJXKWY Papo Dragon of Darkness]] and the [[ASIN:B001LMU7V8 Knight with a Triple Battle Axe]] that is designed so it can sit astride the dragon, and all are well-made, highly detailed fun figures.<br /><br />My grandson loves them, as do I, and to balance things out and make sure my collection includes figures my granddaughter can appreciate, I also have a few Schleich elf figures and a couple of Safari LTD fairy figurines, and all those are also excellent figures/toys.<br /><br />The Dragon Mutant's jaw opens and closes. His axe-type weapon sits in a scabbard on his back and with a bit of gentle force it can be removed, as can the sword from his hand. The sword can then fit into the scabbard but getting the axe handle into his hand would require too much force, plus he just looks better as he comes, sword in hand, axe on back. On some Papo Mutants, such as the Crocodile, there is a weapon in each hand and these can be moved from hand to hand.<br /><br />Great toys for sparking the imaginations of children and adults. It's great to watch the grandkids make up stories and spin yarns about these figures. And these figures, alongside fantastical Schleich and Safari LTD figures, look great on a shelf.<br /><br />Lots of fun and highly recommended.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|Fun and informative...using with my android RAZR m...just incredible... have wanted some way to learn the stars...more than surpassed my imagination of how it would work...love this app!
1400069742|5.0|Many books about the Roosevelt era focus on either the first 100 days or the last 100 days of his administration.  Perhaps because the period between the start of World War II in September 1939 and America's entry into the war in December 1941 was marked by fog like confusion and contradictory public opinion, most accounts of the pre-war period in America haven't sorted out exactly who said what - on and off the record - and what the machinations and their motivations were.  With the dearth of credible information, rumors poured over the decades.  I vividly recall the day my 8th grade history teacher told our class, with great fervor, that Franklin Roosevelt \\"knew all along about Pearl Harbor - he wanted us in that war\\".  (Of course, that same teacher regularly dropped questionable bombshells, such as the whopper that Hitler was a monotesticular homosexual. After a while I stopped accepting her comments at face value.)  Lynne Olson's \\"Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh, and America's Fight Over World War II, 1939-1941\\" goes a long way toward clarifying the era and its protagonists.<br /><br />Far from the revisionist portrait painted by my 8th grade history teacher - which has become accepted in some circles - FDR is not painted here as a Machiavellian schemer determined to engage America in World War II.  Instead, he's portrayed as timidly tiptoeing with public opinion - sometimes behind it.  FDR once said \\"It's a terrible thing to try and lead people, only to look over your shoulder and find no one following\\".  But the evidence presented in Those Angry Days paints Roosevelt as a [Bill] Clintonian figure: bound by polling data and reluctant to take a stand on any controversial issue which may cost him votes.  A rare moment of political courage comes a few weeks before the 1940 election, when FDR approves and presides over America's first peacetime draft.  But once the election is over, FDR pulls back - unwilling to do much beyond sending Britain some outdated war materiel and talk tough against Hitler.<br /><br />The portrait of Charles Lindbergh is even less flattering.  The pilot emerges as an Asbergerian figure: supremely knowledgeable about everything related to aviation, enamored of silly notions about Eugenics, anti-Semitic without acknowledging it, and clueless about much of the real world - political and non.  Used by America First, Lindbergh ignores his wife's advice to tone down his rhetoric - damaging his reputation to the extent that decades later, his daughter was shunned by classmates.  Lindbergh's moral blindness is such that he cannot differentiate between a few American soldiers desecrating a Japanese corpse and the monstrous evil of the Holocaust.  In a lengthy epilogue, the author recounts Lindberg's bizarre last decades: a distant yet controlling husband, fathering seven children with three mistresses, and surreptitiously visiting the Smithsonian to gaze at the Spirit of Saint Louis.  But even here, Lindbergh is not a villain, but rather a self-deluded lost soul.<br /><br />If there are any villains in this book, they are the supporting players: Senator Burton K. Wheeler and General Harry \\"Hap\\" Arnold, who conspired to leak classified information to the Chicago Tribune's Chesly Manly; and Tribune publisher Robert McCormack - whose decision to publish Manly's trumped up article on \\"FDR's War Plans\\" (in reality a \\"just in case\\" scenario of the type governments often create) was an egregious breach of national security.<br /><br />It's Wendell Willkie, FDR's opponent in the 1940 election, who emerges as the true hero.  By quelling the isolationists in his own party, Willkie essentially ended isolation vs. intervention as a campaign issue in the 1940 election.  By doing so, he may well have swung the election to Roosevelt.  Although he declined to serve in FDR's administration, he became a roving ambassador, championing both Britain and internationalism.  Ironically, Willkie died in October 1944 - severalmonths before Roosevelt.  Willkie's running mate, Charles McNary, died in February 1944.  As there was no mechanism for appointing a new Vice President (as was done with Gerald Ford), under the old method of succession, Willkie's Secretary of State would have become President.  One can only guess who that might have been.<br /><br />Roosevelt held Willkie in high esteem.  Upon Willkie's death, FDR referred to Willkie's \\"tremendous courage - his dominating trait\\" and chastised an aide who spoke negatively about Willkie: \\"Don't ever say anything like that around here again.  Don't even think it.  You of all people ought to know that we might not have had Lend-Lease or Selective Service or a lot of other things if it hadn't been for Wendell Willkie.  He was a godsend to this country when we needed him most.\\"<br /><br />The isolationist movement in the 1940s was a diverse group: parents who were fearful of their childrens' futures; disillusioned World War I veterans; members of the America First committee - who were themselves touched by various individuals who were either anti-Semitic, anti-British, anti-Roosevelt, or all of the above.  Reading Olson's book, I realized the spiritual children of the isolationists range from Pat Buchanan (who continues to write that Hitler was never a threat to the United States) to Green Party members who have told me that America should have \\"turned the other cheek\\" in response to the 9/11 attacks.  Today's anger may be heard in different issues, witness the ridiculous Obama is a Communist/Fascist Muslim and/or Kenyan meme.  But it has the same roots in the provincial, the bigoted, the fearful.months before Roosevelt.  Willkie's running mate, Charles McNary, died in February 1944.  As there was no mechanism for appointing a new Vice President (as was done with Gerald Ford), under the old method of succession, Willkie's Secretary of State would have become President.  One can only guess who that might have been.<br /><br />Roosevelt held Willkie in high esteem.  Upon Willkie's death, FDR referred to Willkie's \\"tremendous courage - his dominating trait\\" and chastised an aide who spoke negatively about Willkie: \\"Don't ever say anything like that around here again.  Don't even think it.  You of all people ought to know that we might not have had Lend-Lease or Selective Service or a lot of other things if it hadn't been for Wendell Willkie.  He was a godsend to this country when we needed him most.\\"<br /><br />The isolationist movement in the 1940s was a diverse group: parents who were fearful of their childrens' futures; disillusioned World War I veterans; members of the America First committee - who were themselves touched by various individuals who were either anti-Semitic, anti-British, anti-Roosevelt, or all of the above.  Reading Olson's book, I realized the spiritual children of the isolationists range from Pat Buchanan (who continues to write that Hitler was never a threat to the United States) to Green Party members who have told me that America should have \\"turned the other cheek\\" in response to the 9/11 attacks.  Today's anger may be heard in different issues, witness the ridiculous Obama is a Communist/Fascist Muslim and/or Kenyan meme.  But it has the same roots in the provincial, the bigoted, the fearful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its amazing you all need to get it I say five stars!!!!!!!!!!!!:);) its the most funnesst game ever and they come out with updates every day and its free and addicting
1401310672|5.0|This is a very easy read. Pick it up when you need 5 minutes of laughter! I bought 5 and gave to many friends.  Everyone loves it because we can all relate...both iOS and Android (and probably others) users!
B000JMKNZQ|4.0|Kind of deep!! But good. Looking at personal values in abstract good for the soul. Not what I usually read every day for entertainment. I will probably read it several times a year. Same as I have read this author's other books.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez: how did I not get to hear this guy back in the day?<br />The record distributors are truly shown here to have been 'asleep at the wheel'.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I so enjoy these books. This style of book is one of my favorite genres. Mr Martin takes so long between books, but in my opinion they are worth the wait!
B007SGM084|5.0|I had heard so many things about this trilogy and as usual the critics got it wrong again. The story behind the title is very heart warming, I even was hoping that they would name their daughter Ella!  Over all very creatively written, never a dull moment!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|It looks like a processor, smells like one to, its fast, comes with a tiny fan. Packaging could use a make over but I will survive with an ugly box that I will toss when I am done.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|An intriguing story about how the human mind can have so many ways of seeing things.  Lots of twists and turns.
140053271X|5.0|My best friend loved the surprise gift I got her, she takes it every where she goes. Small and light, very convenient.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy the old aristocratic culture of old England.  The acting, scenery, and costumes are excellent.  I have discussed and recommended the series to my friends.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very good but sometimes crashes don't uninstall and reinstall because you will have to start over other than that very good game
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|My kids (6, 5 and 3) all LOVED it. My husband and I actually enjoyed it as well! I've already recommended it to friends with kids!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|it was a fun movie with a lot of action start to finish. Typical teenager alien comes to earth and battles evil in a high school. The special effects were very good, the story line good but violence in a high school just isn't cool these days. The story could have chosen a better backdrop for the battle scene.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig clicks in this episode of Bond movies. I found it worth watching twice so I wouldn't miss any of the parts.<br /><br />I think this is the best Bond impression that Craig has performed.<br /><br />Cons, where is the gadgets? There are very few Spy toys, so what's up with that? Not even an exploding pen!
B001AFF25W|5.0|I am not a regular reader, but I was easily able to finish this book and also implemented some of the things I learnt immediately. One of my coworker also bought this book and she is loving it.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My mind keeps going back to this sweet and funny story. Call me crazy, but I have watched this animated children's movie at least 6 times--and I am a senior citizen! The music and the scenery touch the heart of any Brazilophile. I love the voices of Anne Hathaway and Jesse Eisenberg and their poignant, often profound dialogue. And in the midst of the fun, eye candy, and upbeat rhythms, the story makes an important statement about trade in endangered tropical birds.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I can do without all the advertisements with each play!<br /> But overall I enjoy playing Spider here or on the computer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun. It has so much cooludhfxnchjc kxkdjxbejdjjskxjsjbdjdnf bc Mr men bash vs New New Jersey devils the world is fun fun fun and fun very well be the<br /> stuff[[ASIN:B004WIOUWK Charmtastic Metal Clip-On Charms 1/Pkg-LOL]]
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Kids love it. Takes them off the computer ans phones.  Carry it anywhere with the kindle,  download quick and easy
B0032Y8XH8|1.0|The item was a CD, arrived in good condition, and was shipped fast.  Good Amazon service, as always.  But this band's music is the most god-awful ridiculous noise imaginable.  If you're into music that sounds like a marching band on psychotropics with guitars and banjos, fronted by a singer who just downed six shots of whiskey and smoked a pack of camels and wants to sound like Dave Matthews, this is for you.  If you expected a careful and tasteful blend of contemporary and traditional music that was written to bring out the best of each instrument to form something new yet familiar, you'd be disappointed.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I've seen Christopher Nolan's Inception seven times now. And each time, it's left me exhilarated, mentally stimulated, and wanting more. The big-budget execution of its intricate concept -- which circles the idea of accessing and manipulating our dreams, memories, and psyches -- comes together in a thrilling reality-bending experience, one that's only hampered by a one-dimensional focus on its supporting characters and a necessity to quickly force-feed the rules the film must abide by. The only thing more gripping than the actual experience of watching Nolan's penmanship play out on-screen is the ambiguity that follows when the credits roll, which transforms everything you've seen into an intricate, wholly fascinating puzzle of a film. To say the least, it's far from the typical fare seen at the cinemas during bright-'n-sunny summer days, instead planting itself in the fray of 2010's best films.
B000FCK65W|3.0|Kind of slow, but interesting to read from narrators point of view.  At the beginning, she was refreshing but the last half dragged on for me.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This is a great series overall. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of period drama. A lot of fun history tidbits are woven throughout the seasons.
B008L1F91A|4.0|From across the room this statue looks awesome, it's just that face is a little bit of a turn off up close also the magnets in his feet are really weak so if u bump ur hand into him u can expect him to go up up and... Straight onto the floor he has fallen about 3 times for me (I'm a clutz) but even though he has fallen face first he is tuff and still in one piece. His base has the justice league logo on it which is a nice touch, and much like the picture this guy is shiny so make sure he is in proper lighting to make him look as awesome as possible.... Also u can't see it here but on his cape there is another S logo colored black. Not as nice looking as the one on his chest. It's painted on with non-glossy paint like his cape.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|Pretty good, but seasons 1 & 3 are better. This season was a little too &#34;soap&#34; like. But definitely watch it prior to Season 3.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Very good story about a good guy who is a bad guy! Great soundtrack, wonderful, fluid animation and best of all it's well animated. And IMO a great family flick. If you haven't got this in your home collection, buy today. You and your kids will adore this tale.
0345347951|5.0|This book is really good because it makes one think about the future of the human race and what technology brings to the table. It will inspire you.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|MIB fans will really enjoy the last story in the MIB Trilogy. It tells the real story behind J and K and will actually leave you with a tear in your eye. Definitely a buy.
0345404475|4.0|The humans are becoming more like machines and the machines are becoming human! It was required for a class but I would read it again!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I like this game very much. It is a basic match two game with a cube playing field. Great FAOTD. Works well on my old Samsung Galaxy 3 and on my new Note 2. Only thing, S-Pen does not register as taps but a regular stylus will. ( I used a stylus on my S3 for better precision.) Nice game overall.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|It was a much better movie than predicted by the trailer.  Clint Eastwood is a wonderful actor and the story line is great.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Lately, most of the multi-book series have been predictable and get boring. This one is an exception. My only gripe is the second one will take so long to come!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I was a huge fan of this show when it originally aired and was thrilled when I saw that Amazon Prime has made all seven seasons available. I started watching them again and was just blown away at how great this show still is. Shawn Ryan created a real master piece, if such a thing is possible for a &#34;cop drama&#34;. The acting is outstanding by the entire cast and the writing is top notch.<br /><br />&#34;Oh, let me stop here to define &#34;writing&#34;.<br /><br />You see boys and girls, at one time there were these creatures called &#34;writers&#34; and they were these really smart and creative people who would create clever plots and well written scripts for TV shows. Believe it or not, there was a time that just sticking a camera in some morons face or some D-level celebrity and having  them do something stupid then calling it a TV show, didn't exist. Hard to believe, I know.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm coming down off my soapbox now.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, check this program out. I'll warn you, it's like crack....one hit is never enough. :)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can not wait till the book comes out!!! They are so into each other but have sooo many demons they fight alone and together!! You can feel the love he has for her and the way she craves him is very intense!!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|seen on my news feed earlier that they had a new cut the rope coming out! so went straight to buy it :) just as fun as the first two :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I liked this book because of the factual medical knowledge the author presents to prove his neath death experience was the real thing.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book looks at things going on in our society from a very different view.  Looking at families that have produced a person responsible of a horrendous crime differently trying to see what pain they too are going through. Trying to understand why and how these children are wired to do such horrific activities.
B00AKFG15S|2.0|I feel the story is being drawn out too much.  The first book was excellent, the second not too bad, but story is starting to get stale now.
B000JMKO3C|3.0|This book takes you to places you have never really thought about or wanted to go. It makes a SANE person ask why and how much different are we from those labeled insane. Very thought provoking and a great book for book clubs that have different views on the subject.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I recommend this book to people like me who can't let themselves enjoy life. I hope I can  remember the lesson this story tells!  Enjoy what you have well you can!<br />This book starts out slow but you have a lot to learn! Enjoy.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|This is one of the better movies I've viewed lately. For kids and adults as well. Good animated movie for anyone.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I would recommend it.  It is a good, safe cover but I would have preferred more color choices.  It is a little hard to find when you have it in a briefcase with other items.  Black tends to blend in.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|First movie we streamed from home. Not too bad for a girl movie. Had quite a few funny parts in it.
B00B3HJMLM|3.0|somewhat disappointed....boring....not what I expected from him..... just not as good as his other material .... It is just OK
B006TJXZ30|4.0|Does what I need it for very quick to check emails. Would be nice if you could do a little more with it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My son has this game for PC and various other devices, but on impulse I purchased a copy for my Kindle. LOVE it. I'm totaly addicted. It's great for in the car with the kiddies.
B00BGZ8OLA|1.0|Was expecting a much better movie. Not sure how it got good reviews. Wish I would have rented instead of purchasing. Don't plan to ever view it again.
B0029QRA1U|1.0|I like many others were attracted by the cheap price, but it is just way too good to be true. An absolutely terrible turntable. I seriously played only one side of a record flipped it, then boom, the speed was off. I couldn't believe it, 25 minutes of use tops before it was effed. I knew I was getting a cheap temporary turntable until I could afford a better one, but I really thought this thing would have at least given me a few months of enjoyment and good use...not a half hours worth. Save your money, invest in something better. And avoid the Ion brand like the plague, all garbage.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|Haven't used it much yet, but I needed a camera. Seems pretty simple takes good pics and video as well.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Fun, addicting, great way to spend time. Lots of levels. Several challenges and goals to build the village. Fun for all ages.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I really like Jane Austen's books and this is an interesting twist to the plot.  Thanks for a fun movie.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The book was FLAT and it was like I was walked through it. Everytime ended was brought up against something he never failed he never broke not even after the series of main events were over. The book seemed very shallow. This will be the only time I think I'll ever say this but I think the movie might be better than the book...guess we'll see
B0014BY72Q|4.0|Having heard of this movie but never having seen it, and not knowing anything about it I watched it with my two sons (15 and 12) as part of my high school homeschool dystopian literature class. The first thing I'll say is there were a couple of mature themes that I was not happy that younger son was watching but it was too late. I found it on a list of great dystopian films. It is based on a science fiction book published in 1967 by George Clayton Johnson and William F. Nolan.<br /><br />Logan's Run is set in the future, in 2116, in the aftermath of war with a (said to be) ruined Earth. A colony of people lives inside a bubble in safety. Society has changed. There is no love or romantic relationships, just casual sex with people you meet or with prostitutes who seem to work for the society (not paid by the individual). Babies are made by artificial insemination with donor egg and sperm and babies are raised by workers not parents. Plastic surgery is rampant. Everyone is young and thin. The women wear flimsy short dressed with no undergarments and the men wear tight clothes. Everyone works at a job but parties hard after their shift is over. At 21 years old people are terminated in a public ceremony, and it is said that if they try hard enough they will be picked to continue to live forever.<br /><br />Runners are people who try to escape to the outside to a place called Sanctuary. Logan is a Sandman, a hunter of runners: they chase and shoot the runners when caught.<br /><br />Logan starts to think and challenge life as he knows it. It's not a spoiler to say that Logan tries to run. If you watch the film you will see what happens when Logan makes it to the outside.<br /><br />This film reminded me of the City of Ember juvenile literature series, about escaping from the place that is supposed to be safe when Earth outside is said to be dangerous and ruined, but it is not.<br /><br />We laughed at the costumes and set design but the story itself was entertaining and as usual it was good for discussion. Is life better without real love and monogamous relationships? Are babies raised by workers better off? Can satisfaction come from a life filled with work, getting drunk or high, and having casual sex? Would you like it if a government took your life when you reached a certain age?<br /><br />We enjoyed the movie and honestly it's better than most of what Hollywood produces today despite the old style sets and special effects.s usual it was good for discussion.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|Very basic everything but expected for the price.  Easy to install and gives protection to the phone.  Would recommend for no frills,
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I really enjoyed the inventive ways he solved his various problems and the twists in the plotline. A good read.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Great gift.  Everyone loved it and plan on getting more as they come out.  Would highly recommend to anyone who is getting this as a gift.
0920668372|5.0|I got this book when my son, who is now almost 30, was in grade school. The first time I read it, I cried like a baby. An after all these years it still chokes me up. This story touches on the relationship of a mother and son and the years between them. It should be a staple in every child's library.
0307895475|5.0|Came plastic sealed and still had the map in the back and everything. GREAT price and had a lot of information.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A fabulous book.  A great follow up to the 1st one of this Trilogy.  The story is intriguing.  It keeps your interest.  It makes you want to read more about WWII.  He is such a good writer.  I hated to see it end and it's HUGE!  Waiting for the final book.  Highly recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A good story with a good plot. Even minor characters have depth and the district's differences add interest . And of course the main characters are great
B0038NN3B4|5.0|This is an updated edition of the Atkins plan. Includes more updated studies that prove the benefits. Updated guides as well, very easy to customize for your needs. Definitely recommended.
B00138KKP8|5.0|Yes, Ray LaMontagne did it again. Of course. Everyone who listens to him knows it. This man put his all into his work. Thank you!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|5 stars, the download was very fast and very fun to play. The grandkids love the app too. Highly recommended.
B001HDWKMA|5.0|Well, what can you say - this is Ray LaMontagne the magnificent, and I mean that sincerely. This man says and sings more in one line than most musicians sing in a whole album.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Linked-In is a great networking site to meet and connect with others within similar fields of interest. The site is set up to enable you to reach out and expand your opportunities.
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|Ray LaMontagne is the best - in my view. He makes you believe he has lived these emotions, and that his story is extraordinary. His musical style is remarkable and his voice is unmatched anywhere on the planet. Who doesn't love his passionate lyrics, and who but Ray can fit words together like he does? No one I know of. He is simply top shelf in every category. A consummate musician and wordsmith.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It was very good. Each episode was rock solid and I have to keep typing to finish my review. It was good.
B00542USJW|5.0|I crew up watching this movie on dvd but seeing this on blu-ray is so much better sound and veiw  and its a good movie for all ages to laugh and enjoy.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This movie is so good! We love to watch it as a family. Good action and good actors. Overall great movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is fun and good and enjoyable and nice and likeable and I really thought it was entertaining and.....addictive, seductively addictive.
B00902S0IS|5.0|I always enjoy watching this Sci Fi movie. Way before it's time...Robby Robot, lasers and other special effects! Check it out!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I absolutly love this app its perfect it is wonderful so if you like temple run this app is for you
B00B8WXFWE|2.0|Generic.  That's the only way I can describe this album.  I'm a HUGE NKOTB fan, have been since I was a kid, and I was really looking forward to this album.  But, I am EXTREMELY disappointed in it.  There isn't one song on this album that is hit-worthy.  All of the songs have a generic sound to them, and the lyrics are also very generic.  I listened to the album all the way through one time, but didn't hear any songs that I had any interest in hearing a second time.  I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a second go around, but I found myself just skipping the songs halfway through, and then eventually took the CD out my player.  I honestly wish I could like this album, but I just don't, at all.  I gave it 2 stars, only because I love NKOTB. So disappointing...
B00AB7HESI|5.0|u have to get this game!Totally worth the cash out of your pocket.This game should be in the top five games u need to get!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AW0KGYI|4.0|Couldn't find a complete 5 pack of this series in DVD. Had to buy separately and this was the best price.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|I read & loved Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength by Roy F. Baumeister & John Tierney in 2011. I like this one even better with her identification of different types of willpower - I Will, I Won't, and I Want.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Well worth the read....and the movie was good too. I give it 5 stars ....and will even 're-read  it later (which I rarely do).
B0083DJUMA|4.0|Definitely worth the time to read this book, but I hoped for a bit more detail on what specific resources are available to the &#34;new maker capitalist&#34;.  Maybe Chris Anderson should team up with Timothy Ferris to make the 4 Hour Maker book.
B000085RTX|5.0|If you like Kamelot now, shame on you!  Just kidding, although Tommy does a great job at filling Roy's shoes, they are indeed some big shoes to fill.<br /><br />Karma is a classic Kamelot album for fans new and old.  Highly recommended!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I highly recommend this game it's cool out of the world if I could give more stars it would be 10000000000000000000000000000 stars
0385738781|5.0|This series had me at &#34;The Maze Runner&#34;.  Sure it's a young adult book, but the action, mystery, and hook is all in here!<br />So far i'm about 3/4 through this book and I'm anxious to see how it all pans out with WICKED.<br />If you are looking for something different from vampires and sexual obsession books and want something along the lines of the hunger games, this is your series of books.<br />I Totally recommend these!
B000001ESP|5.0|Received this as a birthday gift back when it came out. For the price, the auto rip, and the sonic clarity, it cannot be beat!
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|I have watched this movie a few times with my family and we all have enjoyed it very much. Every one over the age of five thought it was very humorus.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|The analyzer shows all Wifi signals in the immediate area and which channel they are on, very useful. I recommend this app.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Saw it in theaters on a whim, thought it might be good, turned out to be a movie worth buying.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you use Facebook, this is the way to go. Accessing and using Facebook is so much easier with this app.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I loved this book!  What a treat to disappear into a different time and world. Fascinating. Take the plunge and enjoy~
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like this app! It helps. e to know when my migrains will be intensify. This apps also is correct a lot.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|The plot twists are great and I can't  wait to read the next book! Thomas's life is about to change
B000VWYNNW|5.0|I bought this album for my husband as a gift. It is so hard to buy him something, but he loved this. Thank you.
