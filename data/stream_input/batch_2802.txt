B002N2SYWE|5.0|Omg amazing!!what a movie..I recommend very much...<br />The suspension and the drama is just great..<br />The only thing is the end.. You are like: that it?.<br />But everything else is just amazing
B000I9YV30|5.0|It has a few rough words in it for watching with youngsters, but not too bad.  Its a real good summer time classic.
030789701X|5.0|This is probably the penultimate guide ever written for any video game ever made!  Even if you're the type of gamer that refuses to get guides, you owe it to yourself to get this one as it's beautifully crafted.  Highly recommended.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very funny...we laughed the entire time and it was enjoyable for all ages. The music wasn't bad either. Overall I would watch it again.
0763644765|5.0|My 2.5 year old thinks this book is hilarious! She giggles through the whole thing...it's adorable!  She really likes all of the books from this author.  They are so simple, but catchy phrases.  And I think it's a good way to make the idea of potty training fun.
0307474259|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It makes sense and supports, with scientific studies, the low carb. no sugar way of eating.  It was extremely interesting to me to find out this was studied and understood by German scientists before WW2 at which time their research  basically became ignored and forgotten.  It explains why my sister can eat three times the amount of food I do and stay skinny.  It explains that some people practically can walk past dessert and gain weight.  It also explains that fat people are not the result of being slothful or over eating, but being fat leads to less movement and more hunger.  The studies are eye opening and gives hope to those who have not been successful on the current diets as a permanent way of eating.  We've all yo yo'd and know that when you go back up you usually go up higher than where you began.  If you are struggling to lose, this is an important book to read.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I wanted to see this movie in the theater but was scared away from all the negative reviews.  I could just kick myself for that, I should have known better.  This is one of the better movies I've seen this decade.  Highly thought provoking, one of those movies you want to see again and again.  Highly recommended.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I was a little skeptical but the movie was fairly humorous and the pace was good. We were a little disappointed with the abrupt ending.
B005NFVZTM|3.0|Pros:<br />- Good to watch if you're a fan of the franchise.<br />- Some nice historical reference, though not all are accurate.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Took too long to take off<br />- The story line is a bit confusing at points
B005UG542S|5.0|I love Harry Potter, and this is the perfect end to an amazing series. I just wish it would keep on going!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|My only complaint isn't really a complaint. I wish I could open more than one post at a time. Otherwise it's a near perfect app.
B007QJBHRS|5.0|I'm a huge Doris Day fan and this is in the top 3 of my favorite movies. Also, how can you go wrong with Cary Grant??
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is so much fun and addictive you just can't seem to get enough uno. And nothing beats free!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I got in on Fringe late, in Season 3, so I welcomed the opportunity to view the genesis of the show. I love this show. The scientist's eccentricities are delightful, the story lines are great sci-fi!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I have no idea if it's actually cleaning anything, but it appears to be freeing up space. I like that I can see a simple list of what is on my Kindle. And I like knowing how much space is being used.
0545265355|3.0|I don't think this is very interesting especially book 2 and 3. I recommend Battle Royale, where I think the author got her idea from.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|This is one of the best Marvel movies. Great action scene, funny and love the chemistry between RDJ and Gwyneth Paltrow.
0765325950|5.0|I was quite worried that the ending of Robert Jordan's epic adventure would fall on unable hands after he passed away... but to my relief Brandon Sanderson finished his legacy with flair and Wheel of Time brilliance that could only come from a true friend of Robert Jordan and an equally excellent writer.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Holy Balls! Greatest series of all time. Duplicity, greed, sex, money, and power is the name of the game here. I would vote for Congressman Underwood!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD, the levels are excellenct and I got a great workout,  I recommend to everyone.  It is awesome.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Very drawn out and boring movie. Never really felt Henry Cavill as Superman. Absolutely no chemistry between Cavill and Adams.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series and cannot wait for Season 4,  I purchased the live streaming  of season 3 and could not get it to work on my computer.  I wanted to see Season 3 so much that I then purchased the DVD.  So this DVD cost me double, but it was worth it.  Highly recommend
B00E8G5H6Y|5.0|The fifth season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars improved on its predecessors in every way. The storytelling quality of each arc emulates the passion and effort that the crew puts in to bring us the best possible Star Wars we can get. This season is also the most satisfying to long-time viewers since it brings closure to a lot of stories that have been ongoing for a long time. If you have never watched any of the series, DO NOT SKIP TO THIS SEASON. If you are new to The Clone Wars, I would advise purchasing Season One or the Complete Box Set, which contains the entire series in all of its five-season glory.<br /><br />To try to analyze the season in its entirety would be a difficult task so I will break it down by arc...<br /><br />The Onderon arc:<br /><br />This arc served as a continuation to a plot thread introduced midway through Season Three. While sneaking behind enemy lines with Padme in an attempt to end the Clone War, Ahsoka is introduced to the idea that the Separatists aren't evil. This concept is embodied by Lux Bonteri, a boy Ahsoka's age and the son of Mina Bonteri (a Separatist and old mentor of Padme's). This storyline began as a political intrigue to show the effects that propaganda have on each side's soldiers while also serving to demonstrate to kids that not everything is black and white. An episode in Season Four also continued to deal with this friendship and also chose to deal with Ahsoka's feelings towards Lux being more than platonic. The arc that kicks off Season Five brings this story to a head, when her feelings for Lux directly contradict her duties as a Jedi. The arc plays out in a very cinematic fashion (as all five arcs in this season do) and it leaves Ahsoka with much clarity about relationships, as her story continues to build.<br /><br />The Younglings arc:<br /><br />This is Star Wars! Many will critique this arc for being childish when the only \\"childish\\" thing about it is that the protagonists are, themselves, children. If you arelooking for The Clone Wars to feel like the original three Star Wars films, this is the story for you. It puts Ahsoka in the mentor position and this serves as her penultimate story arc. The children have a base adjective that will help you tell them apart (if you're not one to keep up with Star Wars names). This arc serves as a standalone, besides the appearance of fearless pirate leader, Hondo Ohnaka. This is a great arc to watch in preparation for the BONUS CONTENT, which follows up Season Five, since Hondo remains central to the \\"Rogues Gallery\\" aspect of The Clone Wars and he has had dealings with a young Boba Fett in previous seasons that are acknowledged towards the end of this arc.<br /><br />The Astromech arc:<br /><br />Don't be discouraged by the lineup of characters that we follow in this arc. There are some lessons to be learned in these episodes. Again, they are extremely cinematic and Stephen Stanton really brings a lot of weight to the pint-sized colonel, Meebur Gascon. This arc completely stands alone from the rest of the episodes and is a great ride (especially when all watched together).<br /><br />The Maul arc:<br /><br />Darth Maul?! I thought he died in The Phantom Menace! Go back a few seasons, get caught up, and then you won't care about reading a review of this arc. After the end of Season Four, you'll just watch it.<br /><br />The Ahsoka arc:<br /><br />I am hoping this eventually gets its own Blu-ray release so I can review it as a film because that's what it is. This arc remains my favorite piece of Star Wars media since Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. Star Wars has always been my favorite movie franchise and for many reasons. But making me cry has never been one of them. This arc succeeds, for the first time, at making me cry at something Star Wars-related. It's a great feeling and not one I would expect to get from this series. This arc also features an appearance from the best character to come out of The Clone Wars (shewas mysteriously absent from the Maul arc).<br /><br />Please buy this season and you will be genuinely entertained. UNLESS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THE CLONE WARS. Then, go watch from the beginning. This show deserves a lot more praise than some of the movies in the cinema from the last five years.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Yes, both lead characters are young and have cancer, but this book is full of humor and heart.  Beautifully written.  The type of book I couldn't wait to get home and finish.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The product Lifeproof makes is excellent.  The logistical and customer support on the otherhand is absolutely terrible.  Save yourself money and just choose the standard shipping because anything faster is an absolute waste of money and will not meet you expectations.  Apparently, Lifeproof lacks the capability to fill orders in a timely manner yet they still offer overnight and second day air shipping.  I ordered not one, not two, but three cases from them via their website and paid $18.31 for second day air UPS shipping.  I placed my order on August 6th.  I received an email yesterday from Lifeproof telling me the cases will arrive on August 14th!  So much for expedited shipping.  When I called customer service to get an update on my order after it didn't arrive on the 8th or 9th, they simply told me that it takes 24-48 hours to process an order for it to be shipped.  Why offer over night or second day air if the order won't leave your warehouse in potentially 2 days?  Totally unacceptable in my book.  If you offer overnight shipping, that means the product should be delivered to me the following day, not the day after you take 2 days to fill the order.  As I said, their products are fantatstic, but you're better off going to Best Buy or whatever retailers carry their products versus going directly to Lifeproof for the transaction.  They are not on par with Amazon, Zappos etc. and when you contact them you're going to find customer service is not a priority to the company despite the expense they happily charge customers for their products.  The person I spoke to could have cared less that I dropped over $230 for their products. He said he'd be back in contact with me via email providing an update on my order.  Never happened.  Mind you that the transaction was complete with my bank the day after making the order.  Lifeproof has no issue getting their money from customers quickly, but they could care less about getting their products to customers in kind.  Extremely unprofessional and disrespectful in my opinion.
1609611543|4.0|I read the book and believe in the frankenwheat theory.  It's a must read and worth a try if you really want to get healthy.  its not a diet, its about eliminating the foods that have been turned into toxic substances that are poisoning are bodies.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Very few movies make me cry. The CHAMP (1977) I think when the father dies and maybe one or tow other ones. But this one creeps up to you without notice. I did not really see much going on for a while other than a very adorable puppy. I watched this movie with my cat and by mid movie all I wanted to do is hug my cats and show them how much I love them for being so unconditional to me. It a timeless and very simple story and all can watch and learn from. Some basic human emotions that trancends to animals alike. It hard to keep it together toward the end as the story concentrates on the dog. I was speechless towards the end and could not stop sobbing. The kind of film that will stick with you and learn to appreciate the power of love and loyalty no matter whom or where it comes from. Highly, highly, highly recommend you watch, rent, buy, borrow this movie however you can find it and just pop it in alone, if you are to scared for other to see you open up to true emotion.
B007AFB868|5.0|A tour de force performance by Miss Hayek, and visionary direction by Julie Taymor.  I saw the film when it was released, and it remains fresh and relevant today.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I loved this movie because it had a very good twist at the end, and how we are use as test mice by the medical/phamacitcal industry.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Compared the the original video player on my Kindle Fire HDwhich is lacking at best, this app is a dream!
B000TEUSJK|5.0|I've seen lots of pornography in my time and I'll hardly call this pornography. This film was very beautiful and fantastic and quite an ambitious project for its time. Its just an art-house film with lots of nudity and sex. No different that would you would see today but with accurate historical elements. If all you see is porn or all you want to see it porn here, you must be looking for pornography and I suggest you rent porn. This is a cinematic achievement. The sets, the acting, the story, make up- all in all- a good product. Most, who are in themselves puritans, would see this as porn for they have no sense of what artistic expression really involves. If there is nudity, it must be porn, right? wrong! Sex, nudity, the human naked or nude body, aroused or not, and all that encompasses it can be quite artistic and it is shown here with various degrees of visual artistry. If you want to rent this film because you'd like to see porn for sexual stimulation then why not rent a real porn that has no story or artistic value. Pornographic material ultimate goal is to stimulate you to orgasm. I hardly think that was the point of Caligula. So please, be less illiterate and ignorant for there is some history going on here both for its time, 1979, and as a period piece from pagan Rome.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written and suspenseful.  I would have given 5 stars but it did not end the way I hoped it would.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|The book is a dark, fun read, driven primarily by the unpredictable outcome to so many characters. The downside is that the author goes overboard with his description of the clothing. The character names are often times unpronounceable. It would help if a pronouncination table was included. I don't recommend the Kindle edition as I like to go back to the maps at the front which is not easy.<br /><br />I will come back to the follow-on books at a later time as, unlike Tolkein, one can step away from these books and return without losing a sesne of prior events
B004AGI2L4|5.0|Centurion is a rousing, well acted adventure tale, with great action, beautiful scenery and characters you really care about....Fassbender excels, as does Dominic West, who plays a roman general....Look for olga Kurylenko ( Ike's wife on Magic city series ) as a ferocious tracker who is a  Pict.....highly recommended to any lover of action and adventure.....
B00EEXST2K|2.0|As I was watching Lovelace I really wanted to like this movie. It you have seen the documentary \\"Inside Deep Throat\\" and you watch this film, you'll realize that even with the artistic license the filmmakers gave themselves here, there is much missing in this story. The actors seem like they were doing their jobs. They did not seem truthful in their exposition and intent. Amanda seems miscast for the second half of the film. Watching the second half of the film got ever so more interesting. Things were happening and I could not quite pin down why they weren't working.<br /><br />The story was developing but it was not synchronized. Now that does not mean it need to be chronological, it just need to keep a certain mode to ensure the viewer remains invested in the story. I found myself drifting thinking why are some of the characters coming across as empty shells and I could not figure it out. This of course was causing my suspension of disbelief to be altered whereas I could not focus my mind on the images presented.<br /><br />To me, the best performance of the film was of Adam Brody and he was only in the film minutes at a time, but he was very convincing as Linda Lovelance's co star of \\"Deep throat\\" and he performed with conviction and credibility. And that is where my gripe comes from, Amanda's performance was not credible. Peter Saarsagard was playing well... Petet Saarsgard and if you see him in other film such as \\"Dying Gaul\\" you'll see that what you see is what you get. With Sharon Stone unfortunately there wasn't much of a range. Did they make her up differently, yes they did. However, she was being well....and older Sharon Stone.<br /><br />Then midway the narratives started to intermingle with it seems like two stories being told simultaneously and that further detracted from the story. Interesting enough, after seeing \\"The Canyons\\" the day before I kept thinking to myself that this film would have been better served in the hands for Paul Schrader and thelead actress would have been better served if it was played by troubled Lindsay Lohan. Even though many wonder why she keeps getting second chances withe roles in films and the answer is because she is very talented. Yes, she tends to squander on her chances, but this is one actress that seem like she would have been more suited to play the part than Amanda.<br /><br />The film succeed with the look of the 70's. However, for such a sultry story, this film could have been told with more bravado instead of it being more sanitized to reach a wider audience or conform to notes given by too many hands working in the kitchen. Someone with a voice should have taken this film and moved it to decidedly darker places as the porn industry really was back in the day as it stand many of the film's characters came across as caricatures of the real people, except for Adam Brody who seem to have nailed his character perfectly.<br /><br />2.3/5
B00004CXYQ|1.0|This disc would not play on my dvd player.  No wonder it only cost $5.  I guess you get what you pay for.
B0092C2X7U|4.0|I'm 14 and I love this app yes it takes getting used to the controls but after you get the hang of it it's really a decent game. Worth the 99&cent;

B001MEJY8W|5.0|Making its Stateside debut, Pascal Laugier's \\"Martyrs\\" was the grand finale to a spectacular constellation of fine horror films. \\"Martyrs\\" however, is not like a \\"SAW\\" or \\"HOSTEL\\" in which there are creative forms of torture served for your viewing pleasure, this film has an art house feel to it that leads into the bowels of depravity. It's demonstrates how evil man can be for the share pleasure of scientific research. It reminded me of a brochure that I received depicting the horrors of how animals are slaughtered for human consumption. If that is a brochure you'd rather not digest before dinner, \\"Martyrs\\" is the type of film you may not want to view on a full stomach. Brilliantly executed in ways better described only as experimental, Pascal Laugier takes us to the end of the tunnel, the last stop, to a place where there is no longer any separation between humans and animals, predators or prey, it' a place so dark, you will no longer have to imagine for now it has been recorded on celluloid. All the \\"SAW\\" or \\"HOSTEL\\" or any other torture porn created to date has nothing on \\"Martyrs\\". Why? Because they French know their cinema business like no other. They leave nothing up to the imagination and nothing is too taboo for them whereas here in America, filmmakers tend to like to draw certain lines when it comes to making horror films for shock value. \\"Martyrs\\" is one of the few crossover films that could play at a horror film festival, as well as a intellectually artsy festival or a gay & lesbian festival alike. It covers the gamut in storytelling and that is what makes this film so powerful and so inherently haunting ,it will carve many putrid memories in your phsyque long after viewing. I would not recommend this film to folks with weak stomachs.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A very good book... Really great read after a very bad day.<br />Makes your troubles feel very mild compared to what the characters are facing.
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|Just like every Labrie album, this album gets better with every listen.  Production of the album is superb and tone is great.  The keyboards are more prominent on this album and bring a different atmosphere to the songs which make it stand out completely from the others in my mind.  Chorus in the songs are memorable and catchy.  I think this may be his best vocal performance on all his solo work and maybe better than all the albums after the Awake album.  Instruments are tight just like Static Impulse.  Amnesia and I will not Break are my favorites right now.  Been a huge Dream Theater fan since the mid 90's, but have to admit I have been a lot more excited about Static Impulse and Impermanent Resonance than the last few Dream Theater albums.  A must have for fans of heavy melodic metal!
B00632HWOG|3.0|It gets me to my mail, but unfortunately Yahoo is 50% spam with no way to stop what gets through.
B002ZG9800|5.0|Saw this at Sundance and was very pleased and satisfied to have had the opportunity to view it for it was sold out. This is definitely a detour for Carrey whom is mostly known for doing commercial fare. It is refreshing to see big stars indulge in what would usually be performed by actors without the A grade stature. What really impressed me were the very explicit and heavy sex scenes and romantic moments between Mac Gregor and Carrey. They felt real and tender. I know this film was going to cause waves because even though I watch independents all the time I as surprise to see two A list actors go at it sexually the way both these actors do in \\"Phillip Morris\\". I hope this film is taken as an example for other A listers to follow in creating other really original and daring works. Specially applaud Europa, Luc Besson's film company for putting together such and abrasive and risky subject matter.
0061711292|5.0|An incredible read! It contains the absolute perfect blend of wit, insightfulness, and intrigue which makes it so memorable. I personally have not always been a fan of reading, however when I had to select a book from a very lengthy list for my AP English class, I could not be happier with my choice. I have now purchased it and plan to reread this amazing novel again and again for years to come!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Cool scifi book with an excellent blend of humor and 80's references.  It was so much fun to read that I could hardly put it down!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is really fun you will love it I thought it was stupid but one I played it I loved it
B0034G4OVS|5.0|This film just opened today in limited release and I just came back from watching this film. Very few films take us through a real original disturbing and masterfully crafted edge of your seat thriller/drama/horror adventure movie....All I have to say is... studios look and learn. I could only hope more films were this engrossing. As I watched I was so involved in what was going on, my popcorn and coke fell out of my hands. This is a really truly horrific scenario that is so real and could very much happen just about anywhere at anytime and without notice. The actors, Kevin Zegers, Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell gave nothing short of outstanding performance and the direction is flawless. Saw Zegers in Transamerica and really like his choice of work... have been following him for sometime now and I look forward to seeing more work from Shawn Ashmore and Emma - all very gifted actors who really own their craft. Back to the film... I was inmerse from the get go till the end and you never see nothing coming which is exactly how I love my movie-going experience. The advertisements were right... this is the Jaws, pirahna, whatever opportunistic disaster movie you can think of, for a new generation. Highly, highly, highly recommended.... you will not be disappointed!!!!! It's an absolute gem of a film. Don't let anyone tell you about it - WATCH IT!!!!
B0092C2X7U|3.0|I am a Teenager,in my put of view all you do is press a button multiple times, IT IS NOT WORTH ADDING TO YOUR SPACE. Sure, my y little brother likes it, but this is a Kindle, not for little kids.

B007D2XSW0|5.0|I really don't know what the problem is with the app.  I just  downloaded it and gave it a try, it absolutely runs you through the process step by step.  Had no problem saving to correct spot on my Acer 500.  I suggest the people who rated poorly go back and read review from the Quilter, as suggested in a previous post.  Happy editing.  Thanks to the developer for making this free app of the day.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|It must have been ten minutes or so, but I was speechless. I was staring at my television after I saw this. It has a lulling, dumbing down effect on the viewer that you fear you may become the Napoleon in real life. Yeah, everything was so utterly unfunny and numbing that as time went by I couldn't help but to like it. There was something simple and sincere about this movie. It does not have the bells and whistles and fast action as most, but its nonetheless a good movie. I loved Napoleons dance number. Was is just me or did this movie also have the same lulling effect on you? Someone said on the message board that if people in Idaho were like Napoleon, the state should be left out of national elections. I never laughed so hard at a comment on IMDb. Great job filmmakers!!!!

B004LCF9RW|5.0|A wonderful sensual film with a most outstanding soundtrack. Sylvia Kristel brings to life another episode of the insatiable Emmanuel. Ms. Kristel not only brings decorum to the role, but also class and a beautiful sensuality that only this beautiful woman can exude. The artistry, cinematography and detail for art direction makes this film a beautiful cinematic crescent of colors to watch. The erotic scenes were so beautifully stages, shot and endured, that you cannot help but to want to be with the actors playing the scenes out with them as well. I recommend this film cause it will not only transport you back to a time where erotic films had a definite story structure and cinematic beauty, but they were also artful and decadent. The nostalgia is palpitable. I cannot comment enough on the soundtrack of this film. The orchestration are guttwrenching and emotional and adds light to every scenes where it is placed. France should be most proud to have had in existence, back then, such a beautiful, talent, classing and sexually charged actress as Sylvia Kristel.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I have had a lot of fun playing the game. I just wish it wasn't WiFi required. I DO FIND MYSELF trying to play it as often as I can throw.
B002N83H1G|4.0|Delightful and a quick read. Funny and sad. A tender look into aging and love, in whatever form. Very British.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a very fast app.  Cleans up the cache without creating any problems. The difference in performance is very noticeable.<br /><br />I can't believe that this app is free. It would be worth it at any price!
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|This film is hands down one of the scariest films you will ever see. And no its not because it has cued up scares but because it is truly organically chilling and terrifying.  Just about anything you can think of that could cause you horror from moving dolls to demonic possessions to ghost there are all included in this movie.  And James Wan uses his talents exceptionally well here.  He is unrelentless in creating a constantly intense filled environment where that will make your heart stop many times over.  The girl sitting next to me in the theatre never raised her head for she was so scared just listening to what was going on she could not bring herself to see the film.  This film will have you clenching to your seat and it should not be viewed by anyone who may suffer from high blood pressure of any other ailment which may cause you to faint.  You have been warned.... for all other horror fans...well... it has not gotten better than this for quite some time so enjoy every minute.  By the time I finished watching this movie, I was physically and mentally drained.  a truly exhausting exposition in horror!
B00005JNS0|5.0|Our Grandson loves the Cars DVD's, it is the perfect thing to put on when we want him to sit and relax.  He is a Big Cars fan. the quality of the DVD is great and we have played it over and over since we got it

B00004YTIQ|1.0|the first time we put it on the pool it ripped, it is definitely not made for a 120 inch  pool despite its advertisement, a complete waste of money. the plastic is so thin it definitely wouldn't last more than one or two uses.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|A smooth crafted cinematic ride, a sort of companion to Contagion. From the first scenes you know you are in the hands of a masterful film-maker who cleaves tightly to the story and is serious while entertaining. This film, about the \\"side effects\\" of psychiatric drugs, has an even Cronenbergian feel to it as it addresses questions of the psyche, of disfigurement, and the elite criminality of the psychiatric profession who dispense so-called \\"anti-depressants\\" to themselves and us as though they are popcorn. The film has a message it is powerful. Reminded me a little of Dead Ringers.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This CD is great for those who like the steel guitar and Bakersfield sound.  I've always liked Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, and Vince Gill and Paul Franklin really do them justice.  I don't usually like cover songs, but these are very good.  The music is outstanding and the vocals are, well, Vince Gill; what can you say.  Great CD!!!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very informative (but sad) that this great genius was so abused and taken advantage of.  He never got the<br />recognition he deserved until years after his death.  The book was well written though.

1476733953|5.0|I Thoroughly enjoyed Wool, a very clever take on Plato's Allegory of the Cave with elements of George Lucas's \\"THX1138\\". Howey's storytelling is perfectly paced, his prose spare and to the point, yet without leaving out meaningful minutiae: you can literally smell the grease, feel the sweat, hear the gunfire. He creates a dystopian world that is refreshingly original at a time when everyone and his brother are creating dystopian worlds. The characters are very real and allowed to develop themselves. I would say the author's greatest accomplishment here is not getting in the way of a great story. This is one of those reads that you pick up, can't put down, and when you're done realize that you just read something that is a lot more thoughtful than the typical quick, entertaining read. Here is a master storyteller at work, Howey is definitely one to keep an eye on. I am looking forward to reading Shift followed by Dust. After all, there are fifty silos and only two are explored in Wool!<br /><br />Iain Mavro Coggins is the author of [[ASIN:B008CBZE2I Lost Apple]]
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|The historical perspective of \\"Zealot\\" is  intriguing yet I am torn to pieces by the authors self contradictions. He first claims that the New Testament is a myth authored to appeal to the Toman masses. Yet at every chance he quotes from these stories as if they were God's word. I still find the book to be a fascinating read!
B00594XOZU|4.0|I can't log into my kindle and phone at the same time. That is annoying . Please make to where I can be logged into multiple devices at the same time. Otherwise good app.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Just the best science fiction series ever produced.  Wish it was still making episodes and that we had 11 seasons of it.
B00AEFYQE2|5.0|Read some of the reviews before I bought it and they were mixed. But I absolutely love this movie. Plus I`m a fan of natalie portman.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Smoother game play but no noticeable improvement in graphics engine. Seems to have more variety in the landscape although it all looks the same after awhile.
140006922X|5.0|I learned a lot reading this fascinating book, despite the fact I have often read books about this period.  I had thought of Jesus as a man who was trying to modernize and \\"soften\\" Judaism.  It turns out that, if you examine the actual history of the times as well as the language used by the people of the times, Jesus was actually trying to kick the Romans out of Palestine.<br /><br />At the time, Rome had appointed \\"Quislings\\" as Temple priests, and the place was rife with corruption.  Jesus was a fundamentalist who wanted to take his people back to the time when they were a kingdom established by god.  Basically what nearly everyone longed for was another King David.<br /><br />I was particularly fascinated by the discussion about what happened between Jesus' successor, his brother James, and Saul, who preached that people didn't have to obey the Law in order to follow Jesus.  That chapter alone answered some questions I had had about Paul who always seemed like the Evil Tempter of the story. So many histories leave that part out.<br /><br />I am giving the book 5 stars although sometimes in the reading I thought of knocking off a star because I am a very chronological person, and the author often loops back before going forward again.  But, the book is so fascinating and well written it held my attention anyway.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Still a great movie. I watched it again w/ my kids. To see them laughing hysterically was priceless. They loved it and I proved not everything from the 80's was awful.

0425252868|5.0|I REALLY enjoyed this book. It is very well written. It brought back memories of my childhood in England.<br />And yes, Douglas Bader was a household name. Fantastic man. He was so good with his \\"two tin legs\\". He loved to dance and the ladies always said he was such a good dancer you would never know that he had artificial legs.
B0052UYJDC|3.0|This book is a reflection of the author's experiences with minimalism written in a very simplistic way. Tips are presented in bullet points--which I like--and most chapters are short and sweet. There are quotes that I can take from this book that are motivational or refreshing, but I cannot say it offers an original view of minimalism. Again, I thought is was very simple; not very profound. But, it is a helpful read for someone who is just starting out on their minimalism journey. There is, however, one thing I do not agree with that this book seems to advocate, and that is minimalism will lead to a happier life. Minimalism removes a lot of excess junk and concern from ones life and that can feel very freeing. It allows your mind to center on the things that matter most to you, by limiting what you introduce into your life. The result of this allows me to feel more free and less stressed, but to sell minimalism as the key to happiness seems a bit misleading.
1878424319|5.0|A light book that packs a punch.  This book simplifies how to be good to yourself and how to release a lot of guilt (that you may not even realize you have).  Every day is a work in progress, but this book has been a big help already.
B009GFEOY8|5.0|I found an SX-70 and needed film for it. Seeing that this is the only film that is made for the camera anymore, I bought some. Although the film is not perfect, it is still the only thing that it is being made. Thus, putting to use the SX-70 I have.<br /><br />The Impossible Project is still experimenting with the film, it is better than the film last year, because they updated their process to produce the film.<br />The quality of the image is okay, but still if you want a better looking image, there is always digital. The image does not bother me, because it gives the image a different quality than film or digital images. The exposed film takes sometime to develop (around 30 minutes), so be patient.<br /><br />One thing that I would recommend getting is a frog tongue that is also sold by Impossible. It helps the image quality substantially. The other options are to make something out of a black bag, which I have not tried or immediately shield the exposed image from the sun with your hand or something else.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this film if you have an old SX-70 and want to put it back into use.

0761169253|4.0|\\"Steal Like an Artist\\" directly addresses the single biggest stumbling block I deal with.  The pressure to do something new and original.  My teachers made me phobic about copying anyone ever, rather than seeing theft of better artists' work as a legitimate step in developing my own technique and style.<br /><br />Juxtapose the two imperative that were beaten into me; \\"Do your own work, come up wit your own ideas, be original!\\" and \\"Why don't you [use this subject matter], ask someone, look for ideas!\\"<br />This can be confusing to a young art student with something of a literal bent.  The failure of my teachers to de-conflict these imperatives put me off art for more than a decade.  I liked the techniques, but the instruction regarding the creative process was awful and a source of stress and unhappiness for me.<br /><br />And this alone makes the book worth the effort.  The book is not a deep, academic tome, and it is not some angst ridden Post Modernist blather, but it has good, practical advice for getting the creative process moving.  The lack of irrational guilt and claims of being misunderstood is as much an affront to the academic community as the clear recommendations for moving the creative process forward.<br /><br />Well done, Mr. Kleon!<br /><br />Edward M. Van Court
B0053KWDES|5.0|The unit works good, now I can cut my lawn with my headphones on and hear music, would recommend to a friend.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen was a most perceptive lady, and she made observations of human nature which are still poignantly true today. She recognized peoples general foibles, the ridiculousness mankind has a tendency towards and wrote about it with wit and a bit of humor.  I can't think of one character she's ever written which was unrelatable, I recognize them all in a friend, an acquaintance or relative and I laugh at her insight and pragmatic consideration towards simply accepting people are what they are and you may as well just go on with your life.  Pride and Prejudice is probably her best example of this ability for conveying true humanity in a very excellent and interesting story. Elizabeth Bennett is a well-rounded and most interesting heroine, and Mr. Darcy a perfect opposite who turns out ultimately, to be perfectly paired.  There is a full family, a comprehensible social circle and so many goings on, you won't lose interest. Read Pride and Prejudice and enjoy one of the best stories in literature.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|This is a great album in a way that sneaks up on you. You'll listen and like - you'll come back and like it more, and more, and more. There are no up-tempo songs to break the flow, but it works because the melodies and lyrics are so strong, and the production stays out of the way. Sad, simple, sincere, real. The material is subtle - and you'll come back and appreciate it for a long time to come.<br /><br />What I like best about this album is that it marks a return to Adams' country style. In my opinion, when he does country, he is about the best there is. He does rock with varying results - but its always inferior. If you loved Jacksonville City Nights - and hated Demolition and Rock N Roll - then Ashes & Fire is for you.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I chose this rating because this is one of the best shows<br />I have watched in a long time. Acting great, writing great,<br />editing and the music make it over the top coolness.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I've read eight of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series books and have loved each and every one of them.  But this latest book for me, HARD EIGHT was the funniest.  I had to stop putting anything edible in my mouth while I had Janet Evanovich's book in my hand because reading suddenly became  a choking hazard for me.<br /><br /> I usually grab one of her books after I've read a depressing or serious one because her books always make me laugh.  I wouldn't recommend reading her books though, one right after another, because they'll appear too similar.  Use them instead to lift you whenever you need a laugh.  Will I buy every one of her books?  You betcha, laughter is a wonderful medicine for the soul.  Thank you Janet!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the puzzles. I almost got stumped on the last level. I had no issues with the app and hope there will be more levels.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I'm only gonna say this once: do NOT buy Gold UNLESS you also get ALL 5 bonus tracks - they are better than any 5 tracks on the main album - they are so good, it's worth buying the whole album just for these 5 tracks. You can find them if you look (at imports).<br /><br />Gold as a whole is sort of a mess - Adams probably wants to be a rock star with a big loud band behind him - Demolition and Rock n Roll follow, and are terrible. It will take him years to get back to what he does best (Jacksonville City Nights, Ashes & Fire) - which is COUNTRY.<br /><br />9/11 explains the excitement over \\"NY NY\\" - the melody is just so-so, and the band is a big sloppy mess, not so bad as E-street, but close enough. When you have a voice like Adams, all you need is a good melody and an acoustic guitar and yr awesome. Problem here is the melodies arent great, and perhaps he knows it and tries to cover it up with excessive production. Except those fab 5 bonus tracks!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Other books much, much better. Just when you are vested in a character, their story is over.  I honestly read the last page on my Kindle and didn't even know it was over. Disappointing.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I just downloaded this a few days ago.  I really have enjoyed so far.  Love colors and characters.  Would recommend.
B007QUUJMG|3.0|Found the style of writing slightly annoying at first, however it progressed. Felt a little robbed with the ending, probably wouldn't recommend, although I haven't seen the movie

B00C7O8TSM|5.0|The Beach Boys Live was a great CD to listen to.  They went deep into there catalog and it was fun to hear them sing the usual songs they do but also the lesser sung songs.  The band backing the Beach Boys were really tight and the boys vocals sounded really sweet.  The added voice of Jeffrey Foskett really gave them the true sound they are known for.  If you like the Beach Boys you will enjoy listening to this live recording.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This was one of the first to download after got my kindle fire.  Really have enjoyed it.  Lots of fun
B005LZWA5W|5.0|One of Billy Wilder's masterworks, a nearly perfect balance of humor and pathos. Great characters (and actors), sharp dialog, beautiful cinematography. It looked good on the previous DVD, but the blu-ray really does this movie justice. Well worth owning.
1451695195|5.0|I found this book by Eben Alexander to be especially compelling because of his Neurosurgeon background. It was well written and one of the best books on NDE (near death experience) I have read. I highly recommend his book if you have any interest in this subject.
B00847KFDS|5.0|John sounded like he was having so much fun on these new recordings.  I usually am not interested in hearing an artist rerecord there music but this one was different.  I like the arrangements that were done on the songs, it made them sound new but yet held the original feel.  I liked the new tunes he added showing me that he still has that touch with a new original.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Just got this game.  Love it.  Like the graphics and enjoy the 3 match games.  Would recommend it for fun.
B008YAPRPG|5.0|A great movie looks better than ever for home video in this latest blu-ray issue. The movie holds up very well and is as fascinating and exciting as ever.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|Great story molded around Beetie songs .A sometimes sad  and innocent look at what we were .The kind of nostalgic look at life in that time and place, that  will bring a tear to your eye and a smile to your face at the same time .Recommended over so much of the nonsense produced today , from the movie and music industry.
B00AAW1322|4.0|its a really great app but I wish they had other artists like black veil brides and avenged sevenfold.  ._.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban, what wonderful music he makes, on DVD, and in person, love all is concerts, has you sitting at the edge of your seat.
0786852550|5.0|The cover interested me. The story entrapped me.<br />I hadn't heard anything about this book when I discovered it. I don't typically read reviews (even though I write them), but rather browse the aisles of bookstores in hopes of finding something intriguing. And I did. The book is definitely YA, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun. The characters, ideas and settings are fantastic here. I particularly enjoyed the relationship between Bartimaeus and Nathaniel.<br />Give it a read. You won't regret it.

0064471837|5.0|I stumbled upon Sabriel by accident years ago.  Within the first few pages, Nix had me hooked with his descriptions of Sabriel and her dealings with death.  The main character lives in a world that can be very frightening, and while she knows in theory what to do, she finds herself on an adventure she did not expect, dealing with nightmeres and creatures better left to the crows.<br /><br />Nix captivates his audience by giving them a character they can relate to, one with her own self doubts and flaws, but one that presses on despite the horrors she must face to find out what happened to her father.  Filled with danger, horror, magic, and a little bit of romance, Sabriel, and Lirael and Abhorsen will grip you from beginning to end.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|An addicting game ! Love it , but should give more coins when passing a level one coin isnt enough

B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|Paul Tough presents an interesting case for rethinking our ideas on how we define success for children. He includes great stories of kids who are determined to beat the odds. I only wish he included more action steps parents could take everyday to put the research to work for their children.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|One of the few films that tell a story (true as it happens) from the perspective of a Luftwaffe fighter pilot.  Well written, reads like a novel, couldn't put it down.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|This movie def makes you wonder what really happened and if we'll ever find out the truth...a lot of weird coincidences and odd stuff happened around this. Keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie!
0671027344|5.0|I read &#34;Perks of Being a Wallflower&#34; for the first time when I was a sophomore in high school, and it could not have come at a better time. I read it as a favor to a friend because the boy she liked loved this book and she didn't want to actually read it herself. I am forever thankful to that boy and my silly friend for introducing me to such a wonderful story. I loved reading Charlie's journey of self discovery and hardship without the usual sugar coating of some books you have to read in school. I think I read the book in pretty much one sitting, because it is so easy to just glide through the pages and be transported into Charlie's mind. It has become one of my all time favorites and one that I continue to read throughout my life. There is always something new to discover when I read it again, which makes it so special. I could not recommed this book more highly!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|We saw it in the theater and she really liked it and said it was almost as good as the book.<br />Me on the other hand just thought it was a so-so movie that I might see the sequel to.

B004FPE4DK|5.0|I first heard James Vincent McMorrow's cover of &#34;Wicked Games&#34;, and I imeddiately fell in love! His voice is so unique and each song is so lovely! I thought that most of the songs would be set to a lower pace, but there are a few more up beat songs that I loved as well! If you are a fan of Bon Iver, then I think you would really enjoy James Vincent McMorrow!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It is very challenging with time and exciting at the same time. I am glad I got it. Thanks you
B002PHVHFI|5.0|Sometimes I want to hear something that sounds like nothing else I've ever heard.<br />I don't know why, I just want to hear a voice that makes me happy I can hear and<br />helps me feel like my ears are brand new. This is so different, at least for me. There<br />is a musical saw in this, for pete's sake. But, the guitar strumming and the plain, un-<br />pretentious voice, singing lyrics like, &#34;now she's a boy in Spain, playing pianos full<br />of flames&#34;, make me believe what I know, that there will always be new, fresh, amazing<br />music, and it will sound new and amazing for years into the future.
0937381888|5.0|How to brew is one of the best books about brewing, if not the best. It teaches everything you need to know in a very clear way.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I was tempted to give this a five star review just to balance at least one of the one-star reviews posted people who not only haven't read the book but will never read the book.  But to be honest, it's a strong four star.<br /><br />I was raised in a Protestant denomination that put a great deal of emphasis on understanding Jesus in the context of his time.  \\"Zealot\\" takes that premise to much greater detail and scholarly support than those of us who are not Jesus scholars will ever do.  It's important to understand that there were many messiahs roaming Palestine and that the occupying Romans considered the Jews a local sect to be tolerated, manipulated and leveraged to achieve the empire's goals.  The relative size of cities/towns, the distances to be traveled, the poverty, taxation, illiteracy, politics and religious structure--all are influences in our concept of the historical Christ.<br /><br />Aslan presents well-argued insights into how Jesus likely understood and presented himself, how he was understood by apostles, the Jewish and Roman communities of his lifetime--and most importantly after his death and resurrection by those who began to formally record his words, deeds and sacrifice.  If there is more than one story-teller, there is more than one way to tell any story--and the story teller's purpose influences how the story is told.<br /><br />I came away with more awareness of the division of highly cosmopolitan cities primarily populated by Gentiles from the environs of Jerusalem, as well as the class divisions.  The time spent on the power struggles between the Assembly in Jerusalem, led by Jesus' brother James and other apostles, and Paul's evangelism to the Gentiles was especially enlightening to me about how the Gospels, the Nicene Creed and fundamental Christian ritual became the accepted knowledge and beliefs of Christianity.<br /><br />This is a very thought-provoking book, one I'm glad I spent time reading.  Although much of Aslan's points are very accessible, I found the leap-frogging around and back on the C.E. timeline distracting, and I almost had to have notes next to my Kindle to keep certain lineages in mind.  Planting all the references at the end rather than incorporated into the chapters also shaves fractions off my total appreciation of the book.<br /><br />Recommended reading for followers of any faith, agnostics and atheists.  This is a powerful study of the emergence of a belief system.
B008JFUNWS|5.0|This movie rocks with action! It had interpersonal conflicts that Percy resolves by saving the day once again. He even gives credit to someone else and lets them take the bow, so to speak.<br />I understand that this is a younger person book series and that is just the kind of lighter movie theme that I wanted to see. Well Done!
B00COO2D6O|5.0|This is pretty good for a free game. I can't complain about anything that's free. It's gets tough and I think they designed it so you have to buy stars eventually.
1107699894|5.0|The best grammar for advanced students!! It is very practical, objective and the study plan is very helpfull! It covers a bit of everything!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It got a little boring at times (10% of the book).<br />I don't like the ending whatsoever BUT it was so well written that I can't even be upset about it.  That's the way to do it.  Keep the reading thinking long after the book has ended.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|Many, many great Zeppelin out there, but this one stands apart. By far, the most well thought out album out there. Each tune has it's own personality. Even if you're a fan and you've never heard this one, do yourself a favor and give this one a listen. Absolutely one of the best albums out there.[[ASIN:B0011Z5IVE Led Zeppelin IV]]

B005PK57NU|5.0|The acting and story lines are always excellent!  I don't want to miss one episode.  Can't wait for Season 4.
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|I was very disappointed with Oblivion. I was looking forward to the movie being a huge Morgan Freeman fan only to find he only had a few scenes. It seems like any movie with Tom Cruise is all about Tom and how great and tough he is. This movie was all about Tom... It started out great but seemed quickly became drawn out. The story line was very interesting only to fade into scene after scene of Tom Cruise being a tough guy. This could have been such a great film and the effects were great. But it takes more than Tom Cruise to make a movie great, like building other strong characters into the story.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I was totally surprised what an awesome story this was.  I guess I shouldn't have been since the author was a graduate of Smith, but her story was so compelling, yet shocking.  If you know little about our criminal justice system, you need to read this.  Your eyes will be opened!
B007SGM084|4.0|I read the Trilogy , for have not read books in a long time it took me a week to finish it. The story line was very interesting . The sex was part of who they were and a great learning tool for those who might have never experienced it.  It was a bit much with the Love scenes but I read every word and my eyes were glued to the book .  Need not say more , but read it .

B009R659L8|5.0|What A surprise ending!  I usually pick up on the villain as a suspect but didn't have a clue.  Anyone who loves a great mystery needs to read this story!

B004DK5CW4|5.0|The most fascinating, courageous, wonderful horse that has ever won the Triple Crown in any generation.  Secretariat will never have an equal.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I liked it. It took me a while to get into it, but once I did. I was hooked! That's why it went from good to great.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is just great.  I can't wait to see season 4.  I have marked the date on my calendar.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Just an amazing story....so sad that this really happens!  Could not put this book down.  This was my first Jodi Picolut novel, I will be purchasing another!
B008OOYALE|3.0|This is a good game but slow to advance levels which makes me lose interest. since I'm not on facebook its hard to get extra points.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book had some very interesting characters that showed up and then went away. It was unclear how some were related to the story or each other. I did enjoy the book but this issue detracted from the story for me
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The continuing story of the Crawley family and their beloved servants. The plots twist and turn and you remain glued to your<br />screen!
B00AEFXLBQ|2.0|I have heard of this movie for years and finally decided to watch it, and I don't know what the attraction is. Glad I didn't have to pay full price for this DVD.
0345533054|5.0|She loved it... Read it in 2 days. She couldnt put it down. I'm next. Can't wait to read it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I actually loved a lot about this book.  I found it very clever how the author was able to paint portraits of characters that I liked one minute and despised the next.  And it was the a very interesting plot, that enabled her to pull it off.  I was somewhat disappointed in the ending.  I did not find the two main characters' &#34;crimes&#34; at all equal.  I agree with another reviewer who said in the end, one got more punishment than deserved; one far less.  Don't want to spoil it for anybody else, as it's a good book that will keep you up at night to finish it....and I do recommend it.
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|Lots of action and suspense.<br /><br />Filmed in my own backyard which was exciting.<br /><br />3rd one along the way.<br /><br />It is call Retaliation for a reason
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Even if I don't agree with every theory, it's hard to argue the scientific thought process and terrific test cases Gladwell presents.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|Such sacrifice of a mother only to be betrayed by a brat daughter and her first and second husbands.  She was lovely, amibitious and self sacrificing and only wanted to make something of life and a better life for her children.  Well, she did.  Mildred Pierce was a good movie.  I only wish the younger daughter could have lived to maybe bring her some joy for all her sacrifice.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I just absolutely love Evernote! The app is easy to use. It's ability to sync allows me access to my notes no matter where I am!  I've used Evernote for a long time, long before it became the app it is today. It was great then, and better now!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The way the app was before was much nicer. This new updated version is cumbersome to navigate and the grafics stink too. CHANG IT BACK!
B005LAII1C|5.0|This item is great. It met all of my expectations. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone that is interested in it.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|This is a must have in my opinion. The charger that comes with the device is worthless and only good for one device. It's magnetic so that's cool you just snap it in and go. The charger has a stand alone battery so it gives you more talk time. I don't like the overall bulk and think this should be sold with the charger versus the crap charger that is included with the headset.<br /><br />If you are looking at a Voyager Legeng this is a must have so go ahead and add it to you cart now!<br /><br />The charging the major draw back on the legend for me. I just want a micro USB charger. This allow you to do that but I have removed a star because it's a separate purchase. Again a MUST HAVE
B007REV4YI|4.0|Very good action movie and a lot of shooting. Rate PG 17 and up. Not for the kid movie only for Adult. A lot of killing.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was awesome it's one of my favorites.I read the whole series and to me this one's the best.
B00BSN0K1C|4.0|This item is great. It met all of my expections. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone that is interested in it.
B00447L4JG|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and I still watch it fifteen years later. So much awesome with Tim Burton and Danny Elfman!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun way to pass the time.  I find myself a slightly addicted.  Not difficult to participate in competitions either.  Finally found something fun!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is a fresh new story about sci-fi creatures that i just love. Lots of suspense involved created an enjoyable novel.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this game. but it needs some improving like that power ups are very expensive and so are new characters.  other than that I love it very good layout
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I have four lenses and lots of other accessories, you can hold a great many things in here. Makes it a little awkward to get out of the top but it's not that big of a deal.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Spider solitaire is a good game. I have used it for a long time and enjoy it. If you like any type of solitaire, you'll like this.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I remember reading so many good reviews when this movie came out, I thought I had seen it and loved it.  So, rented it expecting a rerun...but it turns out I had never seen it.  It was wonderful!  Fun, exciting action while deepening the Star Trek mythos by portraying the characters as they were &#34;before Star Trek.&#34;  Young Bones was priceless.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Read the reviews but thought,  &quot;what the heck. &quot; installed, took a picture, messed with it and then tried to find it.  No luck.  Samsung Note 2. What's the point of you can't save what you've done.  I can see why they are giving it away.
B0035KGWR2|5.0|LOVE Amy McDonald, she's so easy to listen to and just forget all the STUPID that happens in life. You just let go and relax, life is a lot better.
B002SGYPS2|5.0|Just watch it. (Do i really need to type more words for this? It's a good film. Watch the movie.)
B0058YPG1G|2.0|No caption for the hearing impaired !!! Subtitles only in Spanish and french !!! Very surprised that Amazon will sell an item with this features missing.  WI am watching it like this anyway.
0385349947|4.0|If you're looking for advice and guidance, this isn't the book for you. However, if you are looking for anecdotes that provoke your thoughts on what it is to be a woman in the workforce, this is a pretty good book.<br /><br />The book consists of anecdotes related to Ms. Sandberg's life.  They are easy to follow and not boring. She couples the anecdotes with facts and statistics. For example, at one point she writes about the number of female CEOs who head Fortune companies as well as their marital statuses. This kind of info isn't something that many people would immediately research, but it's interesting to read about it.<br />I especially liked her chapter on mentors. I have often seen in my own career that women spend a lot of time looking for someone to mentor them. Sandberg described this as the \\"professional equivalent of waiting for Prince Charming.\\" It was very interesting to read Sandberg's opinion on this because I've often felt that women are taught in professional schools as well as the work force to look for mentors-much more often than their male counterparts. Again, very thought provoking to read.<br /><br />I also appreciated Sandberg's ideas on making your partner a \\"real partner\\". I personally can't imagine working in the role that I do without having my spouse as a partner in our home life.  I find that most of my peers feel the same way. This idea of a real partner tied in well to her chapter on the \\"myth of doing it all\\". Her ideas were really well thought out and helpful for a woman who is a part of any family unit-even those women who don't have long-term partners.  They still need a support network, but have often been made to feel ashamed if they can't do it all and have to rely on others for help. Kudos to Sandberg for highlighting this!<br /><br />I have heard a lot of negative reviews about this book-mostly that it is targeted toward extremely well educated women who are on an executive track. The book undoubtedly speaks to those women,but there is a strong and positive message for those female readers who aren't in that position. As I mentioned earlier, the book shouldn't be read for advice, but much more for thinking about our own places in the workforce.  As a woman who worked her way through college at difficult, low paying jobs and later through professional school at a large corporation I see both perspectives and recognize how hard it is for women and how a book filled with advice would be a great read, but this book isn't for that purpose. In any event, it's a good book, an easy read, makes for great conversations and perhaps sharing of advice from other readers. It's worth reading.
1616551151|5.0|I love love love love love love love looooooove my book. Can't wait for another installment, it has literally helped so much with following the story lines of both Dragon Age games (as well as expansions) and hints at the game to come (Dragon Age: Inquisition). Also, the illustrations are AMAZING!
0316776963|2.0|I did not find this funny in the least. The author's self-obsession overshadows any &#34;humorous&#34; situation related, and the humor itself stands only in a few chuckle-worthy passages—apparent accidents of syntax.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I read every Grisham book.  This one was exciting and spellbinding.  I read it very fast.  Recommend it to all.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I'm an Apple person and have been for years.  But then I bought a Kindle Fire and it opened my up to a new world (for me).  The Kingston Office app assured me that I was going to be able to do what I need on my Kindle.  And, printing my documents in the cloud makes it all complete.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great show with amazing leading lady. Good quality video and speed with the instant amazon. Very user friendly and easy to find and order.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|I never feel inclined to 'review' this genre. It feels like telling a psychopath you're watching him. Books in this genre must be anxious page turners for me, constantly being torn between wanting to turn the page and being afraid to turn the page. I'm going to make points recommending this one to all my friends.
B00499QUK2|4.0|This has good characters and well done photography, it's a bit comic book for me at times. Definitely worth watching.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|The photos that you edit won't save on your device. It has a button to save, but it does not work. Uninstalled.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Clever way to communicate with friends and also find new friends. Great way to read about celebs and their fabu lives, much better than the enquirer! :o)
B00CKR63F2|5.0|'Beyond Bridalveil Falls' written by Sheryl Seal and edited by Katelyn Seal is the combining of several mythologies coupled with the coming of age for a young woman, in her search for self and love.  I like fantasy and mythical stories and this was well written with a creative and entertaining idea behind it.  I look forward to more of this type of book from this author.
B00005R24K|5.0|Film is a classic, much better than the new one. More gore than I previously remember, and FX were advanced for the time..
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|Fun game, easy to learn, BUT no offline game play which REALLY sucks!!!! I have no wifi at home, so am not able to play at home! Can we get an offline game play update PLEEEEEAAASE????
B00CF34B2I|5.0|If you are a fan of these Magic games like me and have been dying for it to go portable, this is it. Phone verdion apears to be identical to console/pc version except now I have it on me at all times. Might be expensive as a cell phone game, but given the content and dynamic nature compared to the repetitive yawn inducing options, this is a steal. Only game I play on my phone now.
1475972350|5.0|The Author has the kind of killer that finds a few of us cheering. Really, who's not unhappy with the officious time wasting members of our society. This book is captivating. It started out as a good read and then got better. Through the  well developed main character you get a sense of justice, but feel bad for the victims too ...yeh, sure. I wouldn't want to be on the killers clock, so to speak.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|E.L. James finished her trilogy on a high note. She delivered on the story up to the final page.  The more you read, the more you wanted to read and dig further into the characters and their relationships.  I found the story addicting and hard to put down.  What girl wouldn't want to attract the attention, love, and desires of a man like Christian Gray? It was a fun, easy read.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|I read Without Remorse and wanted to continue on with the characters.  This was only my second Clancy book, I will be reading more for sure...only down side was I felt it ended a little abruptly after all of the setup throughout the book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|buy it, very, good game, I love it, even has space games, and also has army games. buy the game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|My wife played this game. She said it was well done. She loved it. Will play it often when flying, using my Kindle Fire HD.
B003B02PF4|5.0|John Grisham has done it again and written a great story in The Broker.  The book held my interest all the way throughout.  It was such an interesting story.
B009LRE040|4.0|Good adaptation for the third Batman movie.  Great combination of Bane, No Man's Land and Talia that was written.  Excellent!
B00DJXSKWU|4.0|Nearest thing to Total Annihilation I've found so far.  Yes it does flip the wrong way on my Kindle but I just locked the screen on my kindle and it works just fine.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|This season is full of twists! If you loved the first two seasons of Chuck, I dont even have to talk you into buying the third, because I know you're already addicted and all thats gonna quench that addiction is more Chuck. Go buy it Now!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I liked playing this game is it so fun:) I love all of the mysterious turns and how you can try to beat you friend's threw Facebook and Twitter.
B006E2VTG2|5.0|Zoe Saldana really played her role. This move has a lot of action and is all around amazing. You must watch.
1449410243|5.0|This book is very funny and highly entertaining and a must for any cat lover. I have purchased 2 copies as gifts, so far!
B001CTDH76|5.0|Who is &#34;Red John&#34;????? I cant take it anymore!! I NEED to know who this guy is and the show has succeeded in their mission to addict the audience to this show, because i cant stop watching it!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|So cute and funny.  Would highly recommend.  The minions and Agnes make this movie.  The minions are a little mean to one another but other than that, god lessons for the kids.
B001J20ZIA|4.0|This is a very cute movie. It also has a little message in it that parents and sit down with children and talk about what they had gotten out of the movie. I recommend watching this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best<br />I love it I wake up and play it nonstop<br />I hope that they will make a despicable me 3
1607066017|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this comic, giving a fresh face to this specific classification of comics. I enjoyed seeing the new evil enemies, and strange alliances that the two main characters developed. Also felt the future reference of their child thoughts was really nice, that way I didn't have to worry about the child being hurt or killed! Very suspenseful and imaginative!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Yep, I'm one of those guys that carries a bag everywhere I go.  Some call it an EDC bag, some call it a murse.  Regardless, this sharpener was a great addition to the bag.  Very easy to use and sharpens well.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Great story line, amazing music, characters you'll love, some ...not so much...sooo sad that the show was cancelled. This show made me actually tune in to tv again.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!  Why???Two hot guys in the lead; a sassy secretary, strong characters, great acting.  The banter between Harvey and Mike, is especially entertaining and funny as hell.  It is fast-paced and totally enjoyable--except for one thing.  I am not a prude and don't mind the Sh _ _ or other swearing, but I not like that they say God D _ _ _ so much.<br /><br />I love the fashions that the girls wear; I love the dilemma Mike is in.  You have to LOVE Harvey's spunk and self confidence and okay, cockiness.  I even like Louis--I mean that character is a must in the show, and the actor who plays him does a phenomenal job.<br /><br />THIS IS MY VERY FAVORITE SHOW--and not just on cable, either.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|What else can you say - this band is awesome! Great to listen to track after track! Cannot wait for the next one to drop from them! I hear they are really great to their fans as well!
B000GTJT0M|5.0|OK, so it's not the absolutely best written plot, but I think the idea of re-creating the Hollywood glamour era Film Noir genre, and jet rocket into the future is a brilliant idea.  The visual effects are astounding, it's perhaps one of Angelina's best roles, incredibly romantic, and a pleasurable Weekend evening time killer.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Brilliant. Inspirational. A special package which brings together music from around the world, doing justice to the cliche, &#34;Music is a universal language.&#34;
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Family friendly game.  I just. Wish the screen would freeze,one in Ice Age, for the bonus part.  When the snail and birds come out for you to get a bonus by clicking on the you end up clicking things open and miss the bonuses
B00C2IN7CG|4.0|The movie is  good but the steel case for storage is not shutting or snapping making it very hard for storage.
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|You will love it. One to see over and over. Iron Man has always been one of my favorite heros.
B00136JQMI|5.0|You don't have to love everything by Miles Davis, but you *will* love this cherished album. Some things become \\"classic\\" after a while b/c every one has heard of the tunes. And then there are others which are classic because they simply are...transcendent.<br /><br />The mere sight of the album cover, even at this very moment, I can hear the beautiful yet somber tones emanating from that soulful instrument, shaped as a horn: \\"All Blues\\" Like an outstretched, empathetic arm, the melody invites you to join in relieving expression. A hard day at work? Relationships? Or even a little piece of joy that happened upon your memory. The feelings that are evoked as you lose yourself in this music is, well...cool.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I got this just 2 days ago because my husband and I both have trouble sleeping and was looking for anything and everything to help both of us sleep bedside s taking pills to do do. We like the fact that you can mix &amp; match the sounds to your own personal taste and has the option to save the ones you like so you don't have to keep remaking them, as well as a timer and the option to turn the app off after the timer is done. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has trouble sleeping.
B00C2IGQBA|4.0|The movie is good but the steel case will not shut and does not allow for easy storage so i rate it accordingly
B000OONQ9O|4.0|Good movie about gangs that take place in the 70's and just how they would enter act with each other when they have a common goal.
0143038095|5.0|I will add the disclaimer that I am adding extra stars because this was really one of the foundational books to enter into American literature that put Asian American writers on the map. That cannot be emphasized enough. Although I don't necessarily relate to a lot of the actual stories in the book, it was very interesting to be stretched to think about the different characters, extrapolating the parts that do relate to me, even if in a less-exaggerated form.<br /><br />It was one of the first times I recall being able to digest media through the lens of an Asian American; it was truly eye-opening, and for that I thank Amy Tan and this novel.<br /><br />And for those who are not Asian American, I wouldn't say that this book defines us as Asians, but I do think that reading this, along with other Asian titles, can give people insight into cultures that are perhaps not our own. As such, we can collectively grow to understand and appreciate the diversity that exists all around.
B006G35EEC|5.0|This movie is one of my all-time favorites.  I watched this in a &#34;marathon&#34; of sorts; we watched the Lindsay Lohan one immediately after this, but this one definitely trumps the remake.
B008TTPQXA|4.0|Another good testimony in favour of a non-physical existence of the mind. It is however unclear what Dr Alexander specifically believes with regards to Christian doctrine (although he makes mention of belonging to a Christian church at some stage).
B003ITZBVI|5.0|This is a sensational Batman movie and the special features are well worth the price. Make sure to get the Bluray as this has the story of the Robins coming into play.
B000002AGN|5.0|This is as close to a must-have for just about any person who loves music, let alone pianists, jazz-lovers, or those with a taste for excellent performance.
B00026ZG10|1.0|I only give this DVD one star because it is not even anamorphic (it is NOT \\"enhanced for widescreen tv\\")It is very poor quality.  This movie and \\"The Abyss\\" both need to be released both on anamorphic DVD (for those who do not have Blu ray) and on Blu Ray.  James Cameron needs to quit screwin' around with his submarine and other underwater adventures and get these movies released in proper formats.  He would probably make enough money off of the Blu Ray releases to finance more of his adventures!
B00DQVST76|5.0|I know madonna has worked for ages editing the show etc so can not wait to see it finally! Epix version was a great taster but be much better seeing it as it was intended to be shown!
B00CX7OW1G|1.0|I am so disappointed and angry after I watched this film.  Living in the area, I assumed that it would be at the very least.. entertaining....NOT SO.  I like Affleck and Rachel McAdams, but wonder what they were actually thinking when they agreed to appear in a movie such as this.  I could hardly wait for it to end.  I only hung on, hoping that there was to be more than a crazy woman twirling her life away.  I agree with another review I read... if you are contemplating suicide...don't watch this movie!<br /><br />Seeing the Bartlesville sites that we see everyday was the only thing interesting, and the bit part by Neighbor #1, played by our very own, Casey Williams. As a matter of fact...she was the best part.
0375851569|5.0|This is a great set with some of the best Dr. Seuss classics, a perfect beginner gift and keepsake. Love it.
B00005V9IL|1.0|I only give this DVD one star because it is not even anamorphic (it is NOT \\"enhanced for widescreen tv\\") it is very poor quality.  This movie and \\"True Lies\\" both need to be released both on anamorphic DVD (for those who do not have Blu ray) and on Blu ray.  James Cameron needs to quit screwin' around with his submarine and other underwater adventures and get these movies released in proper formats.  He would probably make enough money off of the Blu ray releases to finance more of his adventures!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I've really been enjoying this show! She is such a strong character, continuously fighting with what she should do, and what she wants to do. A must watch!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I use it to write in as a journal or if I need to jot a few things down. I personally love this app.
B0081336FO|5.0|Any fan of anything BBC and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle will love all the episodes. Everyone especially  &#34; A Scandal in Belgravia.&#34;  Can't wait until next season!!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|This series grabbed me from the very first scene.  It is so well written and acted that I can hardly stop watching episode ater episode.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Absolutely phenomenal. This movie has a right to be considered a must see. Instant classic. Top five on my list for sure.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|My son wanted this app, thinking it was a fish game, and when we downloaded it, it wasn't what we expected. I don't recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works as expected now, at first I had problems because it could download the Chromecast app in my country, but after a few weeks it was available.     The only think I didn't like is that I can't view videos stored on my devices with the chromecast app
B007D2XSW0|1.0|The same problem occurred to the others users : it seems that you can save the image,  but actually it doesn't write anything on the memory
140006922X|5.0|It's great to finally read a book from a historian point of view using historian methods to discover the life and times of Jesus the man. The book clearly is written for people with analytical minds on what most biblical scholars (excluding fundamentalists) have been discussing among themselves for the last several decades. I have the highest regards for this author for bringing credibility to the fact that the Bible has been written by men for men.
B00BQUUH7E|5.0|totally worth the dollar the best game ever I love the 1v1 I recommend this game for everyone all ages
038572179X|5.0|I love that i got it on time and in good condition. I got for my sister for a reading assignment for school so I am happy I got it at a good price too.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved these books and would have given 5 stars if she had ended up with Gale! The ending was sad. It seemed that they went through all those things and still no one was happy.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|A funny, funny read.  The story is so cleverly intertwined with plot and characters that it's one entertaining surprise after another.  Would highly recommend this book to anyone with a bit of an off-the-wall sense of humour.  Or to those who would like to develop one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton is high quality escapism. The plot this season was excellent, but the season finale was a huge disappointment - I mean really, wasn't once enough? (no Spoiler Alert needed)<br /><br />The acting is wonderful and nothing beats Maggie Smith's delivery and presence. Thoroughly enjoyable
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is one of the best mysteries I have ever read. It is the 2nd in the trilogy and I am beginning to personally identify with the characters.  Larsson was truly a writer.  I am sorry he will not be able to share his talents with the world.  On to the last of the trilogy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Out of the three books, this one is the best. I felt every bit of the story deep down inside.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved it. I love how challenging it is. if you are real brain you will be board. don't think I would pay for it.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Fantastic!  Television at it's best! I wish more TV was as thought provoking as this series.<br />This was a great purchase and I'm proud to have the complete set.
B0094M4OW0|5.0|I could watch this movie a hundred times and it will never get old. Martin and will are too funny
0425266060|5.0|I read the Fifty Shades Trilogy and was needing a new book so my cousin suggested Bared To You. I read it in one day! This series had me wanting more! I could not put it down! I read all three book over a weekend!  I can't wait to read the next books...I need more of Eva and Gideon!
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|great game and gameplay good job miniclip. do t lsiten to da haters people. this game is awesome!!  buy it! it is worth the $0.99!!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is a great game.  It gets harder as you move up, so it's a challenge.  Graphics are awesome!  The kids and I love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I Love this game and I think people would also love  this game because it is just like the movie. Plus it has so many confusing and hard challenges for people to complete. So some people r inspired of this game.
B005CGI3ZG|3.0|To be honest it was not what i expected, since you just get to see the cover of the box you dont get to realize how the inside is.  In the inside the discs are just piled up together and they can get scratched easily. It has some ugly carton discs to ¨protect the real ones but that looks so ugly.<br /><br />Do not by this edtiion of the boxset buy the one that looks like a book with picture even if is expensive since this is not worth it.
B00BFUC8RC|1.0|I got this app just a few hours ago. it looked good, so I downloaded it. then I started it and it crashed again and again!!!! not happy with this.app on my kindle fire. :) it looked good though.
B00E3UN44W|5.0|ACTION PACKED!!<br /><br />So, the BBC does care about availability timing for us blokes across the pond...for a price.  THANKS! ;)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|took a little while to figure out (had to ask my son to help), but once he showednme it was fun and kept the mind active.  could use some guidelines to help beginners like me. you have to find clues eg screwdrivers and number or color codes, and use them to find more clues until you open the elect story door.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Love this game and it is very addicting! Great game for the kindle fire but it takes a lot of time to level up and the coin cost is very high, wish it ran by the points you earned. I do not use the tilt method, the other way is easier for me. Definitely worth the download!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Its an OK app there's better editors out there like snapseed picsart and Photoshop touch....I hate when you re-use the FAOTD :-( this was the FAOTD about 18 months ago so I guess I can't complain too much
B0081336FO|5.0|Great update on an beloved classic. Fresh, update, exciting while still capturing the best aspects of an old classic. Sherlock Homes is still the Sherlock Homes we grew up with but with a 2012 update.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We love this show, can't wait for season 4 and since we don't have cable I'll be buying it episode by episode on amazon again :)
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love how they kept so much of the original books in the new show.  For example in the original 1800s version John Watson is a veteran of the Afghanistan war and in this one it is the same.  Some things are updated like John blogs instead of writing a diary about Sherlock's exploits. There are of course new devices built into the stories like the use of texting and smart phones.<br /><br />The show has a modern, quick pace with good plot twists and an overarching plot for the whole season with Moriarty.  The chemistry between Sherlock and John is supered and well Sherlock and anyone really.<br /><br />NOTE: If you watched the US version Elementary be aware this is nothing like that one.  And if you watch this BBC gem don't waste your time with the US show.
B00BAYLS1K|4.0|I did a side by side on a few scenes (dvd vs. blu-ray) and there is a huge upgrade with the blu-ray video. I've had the VHS, DVD, and now the Blu-ray versions. Still not reference quality; but worth the upgrade. The special features are the same as the dvd.<br /><br />The plot is relatively simple. The Australian Ballroom Federation wants things status quo and a dancer who wants to change things. The movie works on several levels. It is a love story, dance/musical, and drama all in one. And, if you can get into it, a feel good movie that might produce some tears as well.<br /><br />I, for one, got into it and never tire of watching the movie. However, I do have a warning with this movie. The accents/language sometimes are heavy and tough to comprehend. But it doesn't take away from the overall experience. Enjoy...
B006S01GH2|5.0|I thought of watching this movie for quite sometime and one day I decided to go for it. This movie was my medicine for that day, it turned out it was just what I needed. It was heart warming and charismatic. It reminded me to appreciate the little things in life more, to stop and smell the roses so to speak. Of course it is subtitled, however, I think I enjoyed it more that way. It would've ruined a lot of the charm (for me) if they dubbed the English language in it.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I started this book because it seemed to hit some chords with me.  What I did not expect, however, was how many chords it truly did hit.  The book seems to be a platform for feminism and I could not disagree more.  As a female leader in a Fortune 100 company, I am inspired by Sheryl's candid look at North American business and what we need to do differently for our future female leaders.  She celebrates the individuals who work outside and inside the home, calling both work and giving great examples along the way.  I learned more bout how I can support and influence my business associates to help females in the future.  Overall, a much better read and a bigger inspiration than I could have imagined.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This is a glossy scifi flick with the obligatory twist toward the end.  Tom Cruise gives a standard, decent performance, and everyone else is fine.  He's of course far too old for his work/love partner in the movie, but that's standard Hollywood protocol.  (A female actor of his same age would be considered far too \\"old\\", for some reason).  Morgan Freeman, despite earning a spot on the poster/cover, has a very small role.<br /><br />Everything looks great, the movie moves along at a pretty brisk pace, the twist isn't exactly jaw-dropping, but it provides something to do in the last third of the story. (if you've ready any amount of scifi short stories or pulp novels from the 60s - 80s that owe any kind of debt to Ray Bradbury or The Twilight Zone then the twist feels very standard, but I don't hold that against them).  I also don't think the purpose of the twist is to amaze anyone, it's just a plot point.<br /><br />This isn't a bad movie at all, and I'd say it's pretty enjoyable.  I love big spectacle scifi flicks, so for me this one was good enough that I'll probably watch it again at some point.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game, fun to play for the whole family. My grandson loves to play it with me. If your a horse lover you will love this game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this Book so Much! It's better than Harry Potter! It's Very True! BEST BOOK EVER!!!! It is Awesome!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have just finished the second book. Both were riveting and kept me coming back for more. Read both within about 1 1/2 months. Am looking forward to the third as the second leaves you hanging.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I've read two of Khaled Hosseini's other books (Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns).  Both were huge favorites of mine so I had high expectations for this - and he didn't disappoint!  I couldn't put this one down!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is the best app ever. I have so much fun playing minion rush!!!! If I could play this game all day then I would because it is awesome!
B007D2XSW0|2.0|App itself is pretty nifty and that's why I didn't give it only 1 star. But to have an option to save which doesn't work is a fail. Looks like this has been a problem for almost 1 year and the devs haven't addressed it.t I'm on an S4 so you can't say I need to upgrade my phone.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|I have followed the financial crisis pretty closely for someone not in the finance industry, so the book did a really good job of connecting the dots that I was already aware of.<br /><br />Very well written, easy read if you've been following this.<br /><br />Don't know why the jails aren't filled with these people at this point...
B0042FZOFU|5.0|The kids and I all love these movie's, item came as described toy story is the bomb!! An having them all I blu-ray is the best.. Ty
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It was a great read but left hanging and waiting for the 4th book to come out. I can't wait
0345505387|3.0|A huge fan of this series...can't wait till the next book comes out.  I thought this book would be fun and I'm really not upset I got it.  I found the way Jamie and Claire were depicted was inconsistant throughout the book and that was a little annoying.  Jamie's nose is supposed to be long and slender and in the book it was this little thing.  Yes, fans are very picky about this stuff--we've pictured these two for a long time now.  Despite the little annoyances I did get a kick out of the book.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Another great read. Keeps you guessing. Never a dull moment can't wait to read the next book. Definitely recommend for others.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|This movie was beautiful picture. The story however left much to be desired. Morgan Freeman is underutilized and Tom Cruise was unchallenged.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|I received my watch today and it is beautiful, however even though there are instructions, I can't understand them. Could you give me the name of a watch store in Glendale CA that can fit the band and show me how everything works?
B00881VLCE|3.0|Not enough puzzles without having to buy more. Sometimes when I try to open I get a blank screen. When it works I like it.
B0083Z614S|4.0|In the beginning of the book I wasn't so sure about it until I kept reading and loved the book. Best book this summer
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Sorry that this is the last book from this author.  The trilogy was great!  Each book can stand alone as a great read, but together they are fantastic.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game!!!!!!!!!<br /> I'll buy it anytime for 100 great game you should try it it's so addicting I can't put it down.
B00004SU5J|5.0|This is my first time listening to this particular artist, but I love it.  It is a great combination of jazz and fusion.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is my first book that I have read by this author. I enjoyed the book cause it made u think.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits Season 1 - I couldn't decide if I liked it because of the catchy dialogue or if it was that they were just so cute to watch... LOL.  It is a little of both I think and that there is something there for everyone.  Enjoyed the show... look forward to more.
0307155102|5.0|The illustrations in this book are so cute!  I bought this for a 1 1/2  year old and think he will enjoy looking at all the illustrations in this book.  The book was in excellent condition for a great price.  I will buy from this seller again.

B007D2XSW0|3.0|It won't let me use it unless I  rate it first that is wy too aggravating for me to want to use the app.
0307950654|5.0|I am a big fan of P.D. James's work and this book was one of her best. I like the tempo of her stories and can never guess the ending.
B0083Z614S|4.0|This book was pretty good. I love the great mystery of this book. After all, I really enjoyed reading it.
B00CBRH4YU|4.0|a rare gem in today's time when infidelity is celebrated and faithfulness is cheapened. the cinematography and captured moments are a treasure!
159463176X|3.0|The writing is beautiful and the characters are amazingly written. Khaled Hosseini's characters come alive in this book, and I suffered with them and rejoiced with them and loved them.<br /><br />But everything and everyone is so disconnected that this book is confusing and unsatisfying.<br />The whole time I was reading it, I just kept wishing he had constructed this book in the manner of \\"Olive Kitteridge,\\" where the author acknowledges that the different storylines are only loosely connected.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Great read for any baseball fan or business person.  Discovering and eliminating inefficiencies is the key to winning in sports, business and life in general.
B0011Z31V8|4.0|Very good selection of the best of this awesome artist, but how I wish &#34;Nothing compares 2 U&#34; were part if it.

1439177783|5.0|The book was a gift and the recipient learned a lot about the hardships faced by the author and how she overcame them.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|and I loved the movie. All the stuff I found hokey or not quite right about the movie wasn't in the book. I don't know why they changed it. A truly wonderful read.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I loved this movie and watched it on my Kindle. I had to watch it in two parts as some of the scenes are so horrific. Its a great story although the ending whilst a relief is a bit of  let down - too passe
B00846REIS|1.0|The trend going on here in the genre of romance and erotica is pathetic.  What Bared to You provides is nothing of worth, its not hot, its not well written, its not engaging and its most certainly not sexy.  Its formulaic, following basically the same weak outline of 50 Shades of Grey, but failing in even that.  The characters are weak and pathetic, immature and insufferable.  Its as though the author saw the success of 50 Shades and thought, 'I can do that, I'll have to push the envelope even further though'.  So she started off just writing drivel...sex scene after stupid sex scene to the point of monotony.  Finally she realized that a story must have something called a plot.  Things have to happen, there has to be conflict, resolution, etc.  So she had the afterthought of needing some actual content, so she pulled some dumb stuff out of thin air: jealousy, a Mrs.Robinson kind of character lurking in the background waiting to snatch up Christian, oh, I mean Gideon, which drives Ana, whoops, Eva to a kind of teenage insecure jealous pouty series of tantrums.  The characters had to be damaged of course, so there is the sexually inappropriate past issues that nonetheless plague their present and future, and the resolution of these weak attempts at plot are so silly its embarrassing.  But not as embarrassing as the sex scenes, which I'm sure were meant to be hot, but having a man you just met, wipe you between your legs after sex is reminiscent of being a small girl needing a grown up to wipe you, which is similar to having a father figure spank you for misbehaving and this has all somehow been presented to readers as if this kind of juvenile treatment and reprimanding is the stuff a grown woman gets all hot and bothered over...  Its silly and pathetic at best, dangerous at worst.  This stuff is not sexy.  Bared to You is dysfunctional and gross...since when did the Oedipus Complex (and or Electra Complex) become so sexually gratifying?
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I could not get enough of it.  I went back and re-watched it immediately.  Amazing acting, costumes, sets, and story! HIGHLY recommended.
0060763280|5.0|I've read a lot of self development books and this is definitely in the top five.  Step-by-step guidelines are provided along the way to ensure mental health and personal growth.  A few less commercials for the Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminars would have been fine - but then, I haven't attended one - yet.  Great book - highly recommended!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I expected to be pleased with this movie and was. The reason I marked it 4 stars is that it left a lot of history unexplained. One needed to be versed in the civil war and the period to fully appreciate its nuances. It was also overly long and could have been told in a shorter time span. I loved the ending though. Very well handle for such a predicable ending.
0375413405|5.0|Mastering the Art of French Cooking is a lovely piece of work, an essential cookbook to add to your collection.  It should be in every household, even if cooking isn't your thing, as they say...even a fool ought to know how to feed themself.<br />The cookbook is well laid out, descriptive and thorough.  The recipes are easy to follow, ingredients typically available in grocery stores across America, and if something isn't so easy to find, a convenient alternative is given.  I appreciate the introduction, and the informative portion preceding the recipes that provides information about which types of tools and cookery is recommended and needed in every cook's kitchen.<br />There is just something about the French, their way of life, the culture, the art...the food.  Having Julia Child's famed cookbook brings a little slice of the fab French way into your home.
1476734941|5.0|I highly recommend this book. Michael Mosley's PBS special called Eat, Fast, and Live Longer aired in the U.S. in May of 2013 (view it at: [...] The TV special and the book take a look at some good preliminary research about the health benefits of fasting (it puts your cells in repair mode). Dr. Mosley provides blood work data showing cholesterol, blood sugar, etc. before and after fasting; the changes are impressive. The research suggests that fasting can reduce cardiovascular, cancer, and type II diabetes risk. The book explains why and how to do 5:2 intermittent fasting. Basically men eat 600 calories (and women 500 calories) two days a week. When you've gotten down to your goal weight switch to one day a week of fasting. There are plenty of recipes in the book. In 3 months I have lost 11 pounds and I feel fuller faster on my non-fast days. On non-fast days I do not watch what I eat. I feel healthier and better than ever. Check out the web site ([...] for inspiration on your fast days.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I like how we're going to compare Wagner to the Beatles and The Backstreet Boys. Honestly, I bet the Backstreet Boys have accomplished more than you will ever accomplish while they sat on a toilet. Though, tell me again, which Backstreet Boys song was written by someone in the group? And tell me when did The Beatles claim that they were on any level with Wagner? Pop music is (popular music).  Did you snobs read somewhere that The Beatles claimed to be something besides that?<br /><br />  What kind of person listens to \\"I want to hold your hand\\", and sums up the Beatles entire catalog as lyrically weak?! More than a decade of lyrics written and we're gonna criticize the ones written by 18 year olds for TEENAGED girls (in the 60's when you could be banned from radio and investigated for writing \\"Wooly Bully\\")? Really?Are you kidding?!  I'll tell you what kind of person passes this kind of judgement... A narcissistic, elitist! My favorite kind of person.<br /><br />  \\"Yeah, big deal.  I know so many better bands than the most popular band in the world. They just don't get the recognition of that lousy Beatles band. If everyone listened to my opinion, we'd live in a better world. The underground band I'm thinking of has better lyrics, production, arrangement and charm.\\" (should be read with a low, monotonous, elite tone)<br /><br />  People who insist that The Beatles were sell-outs, clearly don't fathom the concept! They were in the music BUSINESS. That's a business that sells its art (designated specifically for a large audience). Popular! Yes you observed correctly that The Beatles aimed their music toward the masses just like the Backstreet Boys. (ooh, that's disgusting) Then they gradually introduced ideas that were more inspired and textured.<br /><br />  Truly, if you want to hear the most atonal music that's deep and inspired, just hang out in your room with your didgeridoo or play your viola to your friends who hate everything besides Classical. That way you will never sell out and snobs like yourselves won't ever be able to criticize you, since you're too awesome to sell your music to the idiot masses. You can keep all of your artistic integrity to yourselves and the rest of us won't have to pretend that we're impressed. (because, I assure you, we're not)<br /><br />  The Beatles were a group of guys that set out to conquer the world with their \\"primitive\\" music. So my hat is off to them, because, while people like YOU will always be there to act elite and pretend that you don't like what is OBVIOUSLY good art, people like them will laugh at how they're STILL more important than you and your posturing, will ever live to be. Furthermore, the rest of the people who can admit that something popular is good, will just enjoy the music for what it is; Well written, melodic, simple stuff. (executed in such a way that it is impossible to replicate by people like you)<br /><br />  I promise you could not play even one of their early songs correctly with whatever group you assemble, (especially musicians who aren't \\"amateurs\\") and what's more, you could never get one of your AWESOME, COMPLEX arrangements with inspired lyrics, to a number one position on the charts. I know you would never attempt any of this because it's beneath you. You don't have to prove anything to me or the world. Your art is deep and meaningful without ANY need for validation. (or, infinitely more likely, you have no talent at all).  And finally, let's see whose songs stand the test of time in terms of being discussed by musician's and fans alike for years to come: Yours or The Beatles. I'm sure I'll be eating my words 50 years from now because I'm just another stupid Beatles fan, but my money's on The Beatles.<br /><br />  Your opinion is good for only one thing, and that's irritating people who know better. Elite people bore us all. You're too cool. You're not impressed. Trust me, it goes both ways. Just because you present your snobbish, knowledge of musical masters of the past, doesn't make you interesting. If you can show us something YOU'VE created that could hold a candle to The Beatles, we would be impressed. Instead you just show us that you can stand up in the face of popularity and say, \\"meh\\".  Wow!  What a contribution!  What a fool I was, enjoying this band. I'm ashamed of myself now that this superior intellect came along and wizened me up!<br /><br />  In short, people who hate The Beatles on the Internet are more interesting than The Beatles themselves. Being popular and selling your merchandise is cheesy and if most people love someone's art  than those people are idiots for all that this entails. You should never go for your potential, just stay in front of your computer and talk down on successful people. That way you will NEVER have to fail. Hate a popular thing on the basis of its popularity. Pretend it sounds dated. (it was recorded in the 60's and was definitely a product of the time) Add nothing to the world except your baseless criticism. What a legacy... Now I've summed up your whole career in this paragraph. Isn't that fair?<br /><br />  However you slice it you're a couple of idiots and I'm glad to see that you're outnumbered by a HUGE margin of fans that love a great band (with or without the use of drugs).  And I'm an idiot for even wasting my time, trying to explain things to elitists. Possibly the lowest life form on earth.<br /><br />  By the way, this set is amazing and is a must for those who want to learn about how a great band worked hard and achieved the goals that they set out to conquer.

B00BHMF578|4.0|Very period authentic and wonderful on pace. The tension at the end was extreme and well done. Overall the story lack depth
B009WUBERW|4.0|There are a few gruesome parts which is expected in this type of movie, but the cast was fun to watch and there were some surprises like Chuck Norris being a hero of sorts.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is written from the perspective of a scholar and historian who happens to be a Biblical scholar. His narratives cause people to think and question.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|Wonderful feel of the Austen novels. True to the characters with exciting plot twists added in. Loved it. I will read it again!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie is good on every level. The acting, the story line, the filming. I was enthralled by it and would recommend it to anyone
B00ADS98FC|4.0|It was a fun movie to watch and the singing talent was fantastic.  I would watch it again and again.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This is a fun show, with the relationships I like, and the Sci-Fi my hubby likes.  We both really enjoy it.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|This is a fun creative game for little girls. They can blow dry, cut, and style different types of hair. The only thing I don't like is the constant background snipping noise. I didn't see a setting to turn it off. Even turning the volume down didn't turn down the snipping sound.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I enjoyed this book-it became a  little much at times around the self analysis piece, but overall, a deep at times and entertaining read.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Full of action, turns, and un expecting events. A very entertaining book for the young at heart. Impossible to put down once you start reading it.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Started off a little slow for my taste, but I ended up loving it!!! Highly recommended for people who like the pre-WWII era!!!
B00AXIZ5WC|5.0|The book talks at link about several variations of carnivorous plants. I found it very helpful as I have always wanted to try and grow carnivorous plants but knew nothing of them. Its a great tool to help any grower who wants to try their hand at growing these things. Its also just a neat read to see what the worlds plant life is really made of.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Good values displayed in the characters with  uplifting stories. The way they dealt with the war was interesting and insightful.
145210655X|5.0|My whole family loves this book.  What a great twist on Darth Vader as a father.  We were all cracking up.  The illustrations were awesome as well.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|This is one of my favourite books of all time. A captivating story about one of the most fascinating characters ever created. I have read this book four times now and every time i have been drawn in and completely immersed in the rich, exciting and utterly believable world. Best of all, unlike many fantasy works, it is beautifully written and it feels like every single word has been chosen with care and love.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This is the last movie that I went to the movies and couldn't wait to watch again as soon as the credits rolled. Watched 10+ times already!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I didn't like killing off Matthew.  Two babies w/o a parent in one wealthy family seems like you are trying too hard for story lines.
B00E9PMMX0|2.0|To the reviewer yelling at us in all CAPS:<br /><br />\\"These are not the theatrical versions you're looking for.\\"<br /><br />Yes, this is the umpteenth time the the altered/re-edited/prequel-tied in cartoonish versions are being released in a home video format. While this isn't the release that Star Wars fans, who can remember what the original trilogy actually looked and sounded like when they were originally released from 1977-1983, please be a little more patient...<br /><br />Many online fan sites who have industry contacts in-the-know, are pretty sure that Disney will do the right thing regarding these three beloved films. Disney knows a cash cow when they see one (they paid George Lucas something like 5 billion dollars for the Star Wars/ILM business after all). So it is VERY likely that the theatrical versions of these three films will be released on blu ray before or around the time that Episode VII is released in 2015.<br /><br />Hold on!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Amazing Editing Tools - However I Can't Save Any Of The work!!!!!!  I wish I Would Have Read the reviews before Downloading!!!!!
B00004YA66|5.0|I wanted this movie for my collection. Jim & Dennis were superb. Very interesting, suspenseful story. Had great special effects.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Nice protective cover. I love the design, but only come in one color.  Does the job and looks good doing it!
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Some levels you think it's impossible to move forward, but you somehow do.  I have yet to understand it thoroughly.  It's a great time killer!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Love the concept of angels and demons among humans. Very well written and fun. Glad to hear about a movie on the book coming out soon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is good I wish they had more breads and I wish u could breed horse's<br />But I love ever thing else
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Decided to read this book after hearing good things about it. I must agree with those who recommended this as a quick yet enjoyable read. I felt drawn by the story line and found that it surpassed all expectations.
B001LM1456|5.0|I really thought I had missed something when i watched the avengers had to go back and watch some older movies to get up to speed.  this was a little corny but fun.

B005LAII12|4.0|I was not looking forward to watching this but after watching it I got quite a few laughs out of it.  Not sure if it was worth buying but still funny and will watch again.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|A true story/documentary about an on-line relationship and the almost unbelievable twists it takes as Nev (the main character) seeks to find the truth about the woman he meets on Facebook.  I liked this movie because Nev is not a jerk.  His reactions to his brother who is filming the movie, and the people he meets while trying to discover the truth are real - funny, heartfelt, confused, and amazingly kind. I find myself thinking - how would I have reacted to the information he discovered?
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Me and my wife love this show. It has very clever writing and keeps you engaged the whole time. It does sometimes have a little bit of a liberal agenda but not too bad. I highly recommend it.
B004VFYOA2|5.0|Great show,  Sounds & looks pretty good.  Not the quality of newer DVD's, but still a great show.  Whitesnake Rocks!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|The last decade I thought Queensryche was dead.<br />Well kick out one singer who has lost his voice and desire to create fantastic<br />Metal music and bring in a singer with the opposite credentials and you<br />have an instant classic. This is Queensryche at their best!!! Great<br />musicianship, vocals and song writing. With songs that sound like<br />they are from the era of &#34;The Warning&#34;, &#34;Rage for Order&#34; and<br />some mindcrime this is one incredible disc.
B00B5A9FLY|2.0|The first seasons were so much better than this last.  Too much Guinevere and Morgana, not enough Merlin and Arthur.  And the last episode was the worst disappointment of all:  kind of a crashing end without enough time spent doing all the detail we needed for true emotional letdown.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Decent movie, a bit spastic in pace/flow. I would not purchase it for good, but an okay watch on a slow night.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Was looking for a good cleaning app for my Kindle. This was recommended by TinyHacker dot com. Downloaded and installed -- very impressed with the functionality and quality of the app. It does an EXCELLENT job of cleanup on my Kindle; many thanks!!!
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Late to the Whovian universe but totally wrapped up in it. Can't wait for the next season and the new doctor.
B00C2U6G7C|3.0|This was very different from the original Superman, just as the film is.  The music fits it very well with an alien feel for Krypton, and very powerful drums and steel stringed instruments with beautiful choral work to add a human touch.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book made me think a lot... How often do we look the other way (in a \\"Great Gatsby\\" kind of stubbornness) under the premise of loyalty?  Good parenting involves discipline, setting boundaries and not shying away from repercussions, but is it enough to overcome a predetermined genetic make-up?  In the end of it all, I would have to side by faith in the Almighty.  There are too many unknowns, but fear of God, compassion and love should be able to help all of us go through life with our respective families.  5 stars all the way for making me, as a reader, revisit my convictions!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I can't believe how this story ends! I'm actually a bit disappointed on the ending but boy was this a thrilling read. The beginning was a bit slow but I couldn't believe how hard and fast the ride turned, this is a definite recommendation.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great and fits perfectly in my kindle! Perfect length to reach around the table when charging too. holds the charge well.
B00C7O8MJ8|2.0|Just buy the Star Trek soundtrack.  This is almost a repeat of it, but not as good.  The music was not as powerful a part of this film as it was in the first.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I have gone through 3-4 quartz movement watches in the last 3 years and they are not worth the dollars paid for them. This &#34;automatic&#34; self winding Seiko is fantastic. The last one I had lasted for many many years. The quartz (battery powered) die after 1 - 2  yrs.  I will only buy autos again the heck with the electronic watches, they are worth every penny!
140006922X|1.0|I read NO GOD BUT GOD and loved it. I don't  like Fox News or people who think only self-identified Christians should write about Jesus. But I thought this book was  extremely slipshod scholarship, a real piece of crap This pretentious polemic that painted Jesus as a political radical with nothing spiritual or original. When the author doesn't like a gospel, its pure myth. If it supports his argument, it's godsend. He doesn't even try to be consistent or give a nuanced or rounded view. For example, he says uequivocally that Jesus wanted to establish the kingdom of God on Earth. If true, why did Jesus also say that the Kingdom of God can't be  seen and is inside you? Oh yea, and Jesus only cared about Jews--period.  I guess that's why Christ uttered the Parable of the Good Samaritan about the Jews' worst enemy. But then, as the author says several times, Jesus was just an uneducated yokel and all the alleged things he said in the gospels are mythic--they were falsely stuck there by the gospel authors, except when the author then assumes their true for his purposes (all the time). If this book tried to give a fuller perspective besides the tried and hackneyed view of Jesus, it would be one thing. However, in its narrow-minded focus, it strikes me as nearly black and white and superficial as the rantings of the most diehard fundamentalist. What a waste of time and money
B009P13RQY|5.0|Saw them in concert last week and decided to pick up the album. I was not disappointed! It is a good album, love the whole vibe.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Continuing the standard he set with Lord of the Rings:  love this world and happy to be back in it!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I already had the first one and I knew from the list of actor's that this movie would be great. It arrived earlier that expected.
0671449028|5.0|Cute rhymes, cute drawings and helps get the kiddies in the mood for bedtime. It's also mercifully short, which helps parents who are forced to read the same book multiple times!
B00D78J7SI|4.0|I really like all the songs on this album. I can't think of any that I don't like listening too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the movie but of course the book is always better.  This book drawer me in and would let go.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I rented this one and I enjoyed it so much that I bought to add to me coolection. Great movie and now I also have Thor 2.
0761119752|5.0|Very well done, succinct and captivating to young children. Our 2 year old orignially fell in love with this as a library book, so we rushed to get a full Boynton bed time collection. Even though we read \\"pajama time\\" every single night for almost a month, this book has been replaced by \\"Snoozers\\" as her new fave. Go figure!
0385349947|5.0|I bought this book for my grandaughter, who is struggling to stay in college, single with two children. She was very inspired  by Ms. Sandberg. Just what she needed to read.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Hit girl is one tough little girl, she almost makes you feel sorry for the bad guys, almost. Can't wait for  Kick-Ass 2
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|I saw the trailer's for this movie and it was a great movie that I added to my collection. It did arrive earlier that expected
B007N8RULO|4.0|Love the manoeuvring to move the right card so I can win the game; definitely a game of thought too
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I am a big scifi buff, grew up on star trek and star trek tng., Babylon 5, Doctor who exct, I think this show in its first season was really well put together brought the characters in nicely and made you question various characters and motives by not giving to much away where the critics complained but that is what you get when you put small minded people in charge of ratings and not enough<br />nerds lol science fiction and fantasy buffs.<br /><br /> Don't take my word for it watch it and see for yourself either way my rating stands
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of best games I have ever played. I think this would be the a great game for kids even adult would like this
B005LAIHSG|5.0|We swa the trailer's for this movie and were surprised to see that this was a great movie for our collection.I will do buiness with this seller again.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|The awards given to Cameron's masterpiece speaks to the quality of the film itself.  The additional &#34;unedited&#34; minutes are valuable to me.
B004G606K8|5.0|Read a long, long time ago and remembered only how much I enjoyed it.  Enjoyed it just as much this time!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I liked it because it was interesting it told more than can learn I loved it so much love like
B0050DIWHU|4.0|Like it and it has been a true story of personal journey with great achievements,  Reid is very honest to tell the true.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|Overall, the movie was pretty boring and I felt like there was a lack of strong connections between the various storylines. Also, the dialect spoken by Tom Hanks' tribal character Zack was very hard to understand and follow.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I think it must be linked up with Wiki for information but this app is always a blast to pull out with friends, trying to make it fail.
B0002TJGQS|1.0|These batteries, did not work for me. I wanted to used them in my car starter button but some reason they did not work, tried all if them in the package was sent to me. Had to go out and buy them from the battery store for more money, so I guess you get what you paid for&#34;...
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Lady Gaga has another hit on her hands with Applause / ARTPOP. You can sum this song up in a statement from her a few years ago: &#34;Pop music will never again be low brow.&#34; I live for the Applause-plause!
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Needs easier UI for saving back to SkyDrive where my work files are kept. Otherwise, it seems to work fine.
1452115567|5.0|This is a story told in few words of just how wonderful a relationship can be between a dog and her best friend. Maddie is a beautiful subject for the brilliantly executed photos. I loved the story of how these two souls found each other and turned their lives around.
B00821OX98|4.0|I have to admit I have been longing for a show after battle star glactica. This one, although not as epic in its approach but has good story, visuals and direction.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|the title says it all.<br />i like that all of the clues are contained in a small space.<br />fun for kids and adults alike!
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|When I first heard Vampire Weekend, I thought who let the Kennedys (as in JFK and RFK) and the Police start a band. This album is a revelation and every track is truly spectacular especially &#34;Step.&#34; It has to be one of the best albums of 2013
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|Persuasion is a very good video,<br />it is very interested to watch.<br />there is nothing that I disliked about the video!
140006922X|5.0|I purchased the book before the Fox generated controversy, so the topic was of interest to me.  The book delivers in accessible narrative form the research by the author.  I find great interest in the presented strife between James the Just, the brother of Jesus, and Paul.  Aslan adds to the wealth of exploration for the historic Jesus.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it! I was very please with the ease of watching from Amazon Prime, what a great perk of membership!
B00ECUARO8|3.0|It was just that Ok. I only watched it because I like Matthew. He is a handsome man .to me
B00005JLRT|5.0|i saw this on tv and just had to buy it i love star trek so just another great story line
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is an excellent story about a great historical man and a great holy man not about the fiction.<br /><br />Reza's style of telling stories and analysing them from different aspects and point of views is and amazing way to see the big picture and go into details without losing the interest of the reader.  The book was so good that I could not stop reading it, i continued reading it till the end.
B009NT0I06|5.0|this accompanied my sister's vinyl record player gift. she loves taylor swift. the price is not different compared to buying a cd
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it. Now I can find out the new tax on things I bought. I even told my daughter and she is going to get it for her kindle.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|the connection on the kindle has been an issue & this cable connection is no different than a regular cable.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I love this app and all the options but it will not save the image on either my galaxy so or my Xoom tablet. Please fix, otherwise this app is wonderful!
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|This song is without a doubt Lady Gagas Best Song!!!! It has an amazing catchy beat with a chorus that will be imprinted in your mind forever. GAGA IS BACK!!!
B002ZG99QS|5.0|After veiwing the original version of Tron, it, was only natural to see the next movie in the series. It was brilliant!
B005PK57NU|5.0|I like very much that I can view the Good Wife on my Kindle for free!  It's a smart entertaining series.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|This is a great soundtrack to listen to. Hans Zimmer really impressed me with this album. Cant wait to hear what Superman/Batman will sound like in the near future. Also played this on my Playstation 3 while playing Injustice. Epic!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Tower defense is when you set up defenses to survive hoards of enemies.  With great graphics and a fun environment this will be a classic for a long time.
140120841X|5.0|This is an awesome book with great art. You never really want to stop reading it. I would recommend it to anyone.
0525478817|5.0|I love, love, love, love, this book!!!! It was intriguing from the very beginning. Honestly, I've read about ten times since I got it. It's a must read!!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|one of the best shows on tv.  watched 1st two seasons on my kindle and recorded season 3 on tv.  its like a good book u can't put down.
1452115567|5.0|Such a great book of photographs and a great story to go along with it. I thought the book would be larger in size, but I would still recommend it. Delivery was on time.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|It was to fun watch but I was expecting more but 'more' didn't show up. So I gave it 3 stars.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|I'm new to David Sedaris and this book had me howling with laughter, sometimes at night while my poor husband was trying to sleep.
0316228583|5.0|Any reservations I had about reading this book were blown-away in the first few pages where readers who love unusual storytelling will be hooked and launched into an absorbing reading experience.<br /><br />I read the first Harry Potter novel when it came out and I enjoyed it.  I also realized the potential for huge sequels, but I wasn't interested enough in following the wizard's story and since that time I have been looking forward to Rowling's first novel not for kids.<br /><br />Presumably, many people picked up this book expecting something easier and more fanciful. Serious readers will not feel the same way.  Here is a complicated and richly told story about our darker natures and how cruelty comes in a variety of textures with delicious just desserts meted out to the guilty.<br /><br />Those of us who have experienced cruelty in public will be relieved and informed to read this insightful story.  Those who are looking for something light and fun will be disappointed.  As will those who had Rowling's fantasy books read to them by parents or school teachers.<br /><br />I have not written many rave reviews on Amazon.  This book deserves it and I have absolutely no suggestions for improving this storytelling.  Please don't overlook it because readers without your level of literacy can't understand it.<br /><br />This great book will outlive any petty complaints.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Pics won't save! Makes this app fairly useless for me. Also, why can't I share directly to any app? I'd like to be able to post to instagram or Gmail
B007D2XSW0|1.0|So far, I HAVE only tried to use the app for 10 minutes, but in that time, I've tried opening pictures in my Galaxy Note 2 via all three photo editing options (to no avail), as well as opening the app up itself to both clear its cache, then uninstall it, shut my device down for a few seconds, start my device back up, and reinstall the app. Nothing has worked. All I've been left with, in trying to open up any image or the camera, has been the same black screen I've started with. In trying to open the gallery, the app WILL successfully open the gallery itself, but not any images there. Still just a black screen.<br /><br />Long story short, epic fail. How can a company release a photo editing app when it doesn't even communicate properly with its device's camera or gallery? Then said company wants to charge five bucks for the app?!? Another worthless app that's overpriced!!! Had I actually paid for it instead if getting this as the FAoTD, I'd be even angrier than I am, but FAoTD or not, an app normally charged five bucks for SHOULD do what it's supposed to!
B004GFN11A|4.0|The application is easy to use for the most part and allows full access to the features of Wordpress on a web platform.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|It's simple, entertaining, and challenging from time to time!I love it! Hence there is five stars goes to it... What do you mean by forcing at least twenty words ?!?!? This is nonsence!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved these books, was hard to put down. If you liked 50 shades you enjoy this book as well...<br /> Looking forward to the 4th book to come out.
B0061S0A64|3.0|Didn't really see the point of this app.<br /><br />Not very engaging or interactive to be available for $1.95. Wasn't entertained.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Great Movie !!  My 8 year old loved this movie and wants to watch it again.  We would recommend it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If you liked 50 shades you will love these books as well.  Couldn't put the book down, read all three and looking forward to the 4th one...
B0067RQYNW|4.0|The application is an excellent alternative to Office Suit, the free version of the software comes packed with enough features to not limit users completely.
159562015X|5.0|I wish this book lent itself to group discussions, providing more than a one time test taking, I didn't realize it timed out and you can only take it once and a pricey book! Information helpful.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it. i play this game all the time. its very fun to play and easy to get the hang of.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love these games. Wish they had the whole game without paying for it. Not everyone can afford it. It's something to think about. But the demos r good enough for now.
B009CF3P7E|4.0|The history of young Kirk, Spock and ALL the gang is a great twist for any Trekkie (even a casual fan).. Very good animation. Lot's of action. Very decent story for a movie of this genre. If you are a sci-fi fan, it is a must. If not, it is still a good action flick.
B00821PCJS|4.0|You may like Falling Skies. Engaging characters. Some interesting twists and turns. Well acted.The writing is lame sometimes but still worth the time and money in my opinion.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It's a good last book. Though I'm a little sad that only one person died. At least in most good books more people die. It makes it exiting.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is one app you should get if you are like me and do not know or do have time to look it up..This app dose an excellent job and its free. Give it a try
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best in-flight reading material. Fast-paced with a unique story-line. So glad I decided to read the books instead of watching the movies.
B005544V6A|3.0|I know I'm &#34;supposed&#34; to like thew characters of Harvey and Mike best, but Louis Litt is my favorite just because he's so weird and sometimes evil.  However, the newness is wearing off & I'm getting bored with the Harvey who can do no wrong and Mike who can do no right routine.  I wish they'd develop those characters more.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Perhaps I was expecting too much based on all the glowing reviews but the book didn't really wow me. I love a good thriller and while there were some delicious twists, I found myself getting annoyed at how the story went on and on.
B008BQ8VOC|3.0|I started watching this on a wshim & got into it very quickly.  It's about an attorney who never loses (that gets boring after a few shows) and an ex druggie messenger boy who is brilliant and starts pretending he's a Harvard law grad and becomes Harvey's (never lose attorney) intern.  It's a fun premise but gets old after awhile.  The best thing this show has going for it are 2 &#34;minor&#34; characters- Donna, whi is Harvey's secretary, and Louis, who is Harvey's competition/ rival.  If it wasn't for these two characters I would stop watching it.
B009KUWWW0|5.0|Great continuity to Pillars and keeping the relationships alive from the past.  The Black Plague, the feudal system, and the role the church played were fascinating.
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|This show has matured well. It keeps taking forever to see the mother in this, but it has been a very good run
B008MM9630|5.0|This game is fairly fun. I like the graphics and missions within the game. I would recommend this to a friend.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I like Jillian. I bought almost all of her dvd's in the hopes of starting to loose 30 lbs that I need to get off of my body. I am in my later 20's and a vegetarian who tries really hard to eat and drink healthfully. I get outside everyday, but really need to loose some weight.<br /><br />This did not work, no matter how bad I wanted it too.<br /><br />I started this in May and started right away, with a free online trial of her diet plan to help with this I was onboard and using her DVD's M-F with the weekend filled with out door activity. I was keeping track of my work outs, activities and food. I just gave up after only loosing 8 pounds, no where near the 30 I thought I would be on my way to loosing. Even at 2 pounds a week I should have lost more and I gave up with complete disappointment.<br /><br />So I loved the video and it was easy to follow. Jillian has a great body and that inspired my, she is a great teacher and the video was not bad at all. I liked that it was mixed up in her 3-2-1 set up and really had high hopes. But for me it didn't work at all.
1781162646|5.0|Not your typical Stephen King but a very fun read. The  book reads quickly and is very interesting but not the typical scary that you would expect. I would definitely recommend it.
B00E193TM2|2.0|not worth the money. why do i have to type so many words to rate a stupid song? 1 word
1419849565|5.0|This is a great female series for those moms & daughters who have put in the time & effort to develop a relationship...
B003U4ZQRK|2.0|Great show, but by now it's really getting silly. We'll see how it winds up. I've got enough invested in the show to see it through to the end.
159463176X|5.0|AND THE MOUNTAINS ECHOED is more than the story of four generations of an Afghani family between 1949 and 2012.<br /> The book begins with the story of a poor village family.  There are five children, the youngest of whom was his father's favorite.  One day a div came to the village and demanded that the parents chose one of the children to give to him.  If they didn't, he would take all the children.  The father took small stones, wrote each child's name on one of them, put them in a bag, and withdrew one.  It had the name of the youngest.  In order to spare his other children's lives, he gave the youngest to the div.  Trying to escape the deep depression caused by this, the father decided to travel the very difficult journey to see his son again.  When the div opens the curtains, the father sees that his son if very happy, playing in a beautiful environment with other children.  The div tells the father he could take the child back home, but he could never return.  Or the boy could stay but the father could never return.  Reluctantly, the father decides to let his son have a better life and he leaves.  The div, gives him a potion to drink which totally erases the memory of his son, enabling him to continue his life in some peace.<br /> The story becomes reality with the story of  ten-year-old Abdullah and his three-year-old sister, Pari.  Their mother died and their father remarried.  The children were extremely close.  Life was very difficult and when a wealthy couple offers to buy Pari, the father agreed.  Abdullah missed her the rest of his life.  Pari was too young to remember her biological family but wondered about her life, always feeling something wasn't right.<br /> The book continues telling about the lives of Abdullah, Pari, their families, and other people with whom they are involved..  It's about love, hope, determination, acceptance, betrayal, and pain.  It moves between Kabul to Paris to San Francisco and to Tinos.<br /> Khalad Hossein brings philosophy and humor to his beautifully written story:<br /> After being the death of his employer, Nabi realizes that now that he had the freedom to do whatever he wanted, \\" found the freedom illusory, for what I wished for the most had been taken from my.  They say, Find a purpose in your life and live it.  But, sometimes, it is only after you have lived that you recognize your life had a purpose, and likely one you never had in mind.  And now that I had muffled mine, I felt aimless and adrift\\".<br /> Regarding domestic violence, a woman explains, \\"Men like him...are all the same...Some are more polished, granted.  They may come with a bit of charm-or a lot-and that can fool you.  But really they're all unhappy little boys sloshing around in their own rage.  They feel wronged.  They haven't been given their due.  No one loved them enough.  Of course, they expect you to love them.  They want to be held, rocked, reassured.  But it's a mistake to give it to them.  They can't accept it.  They can't accept the very thing they're needing.  They end up hating you for it.  And it never ends because they can't hate you enough.  It never ends-the misery, the apologies, the promises, the reneging, the wretchedness of it all.\\"<br /> As she faces a major medical problem, one woman muses:  \\"James Parkinson.  George Huntington.  Robert Graves. John Down.  Now this Lou Gehrig fellow of mine.  How did men come to monopolize disease names too?\\"<br /> In an interview, Nila, who became famous when she lived in Paris, revealed she couldn't quite understand how her adopted daughter Pari became a mathematician.  The interviewer suggested, \\"Perhaps it's her way of rebelling.  You know a thing or two about rebellion, I think.\\"  Nila replied, \\"Yes, but I did it the proper way.  I drank and smoked and took lovers.  Who rebels with mathematics?\\"<br /> Like his previous books, THE KITE RUNNER and A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS, Khaled Hosseini once again guides the reader on an insightful, moving adventure.  While there story moves back and forth in time and many of the characters appear to be extraneous, they all play an important role and the threads come together to weave a beautiful cloth.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has been my new obsession lately. Simular in style to Temple Run...but with its own dispicable touches. Love this game!!!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Love this app. My niece likes to jump on the kindle and play this game. So do I. Love love love.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I have downloaded several movies and have not had a problem finding one's I like nor any problem downloading.  Does everything I want it too.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|nicely fleshed out characters.  believable (well, if you assume zombies exist) scenarios.  cliff hangers.  good pointers for when the apacolypse happens.
0920668372|5.0|I'm not sure if my kids like this as much as I do. The first time I read it, I nearly bawled. Maybe that's because I was pregnant with my 3rd kid. Even after all this time, I still love it. It reminds you of the love a parent has for a child, and hopefully the reciprocation of it one day!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series! And I love that I can watch it for FREE with my premium account!  I hate waiting to see the next show, so waiting to watch the series isn't a big deal for me.  I like being able to watch the shows at my leisure.
0763619612|5.0|We love this book. The illustrations are beautiful, and the theme is such a good one too. Definitely recommend it
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Seriously Amazon, why is it that the Google Play Store has had multiple updates to this game but yet none here? Seems to be the thing with Amazon Apps, going to purchase my apps on Google Play from now on...
0440246008|5.0|All of this author's books are absolutely wonderful - I can't put any of them down-ingenious intrigue, and wonderful description
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I liked it it is cool I'll tell my friends about it it's good and it's funny how you can make your self purple and blue
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! Its so cool. I love the minions and loved the movie. This was great. It is kinda like temple run and subway surfers mashed up. I would recommend this for people who love Despicable Me and FUN!!! :) :) :D c:
B00CH26TL8|1.0|After a few levels, you can't win without in-app purchases. Boo. There are other bubble games out there.  I will play them.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I just don't even have the words to describe how much I loved this book. The storyline isn't new- player/bad boy meets girl who won't take his shit and he falls in love, but Emma Chase takes the whole concept and turns it on it's ear.<br /><br />Drew Evans' is a egotistical, chauvinistic and some what self-centered man. He likes woman but only once. And he's full of wisdom like this...<br /><br />Let me repeat that in case you missed it:<br /><br />ALL GUYS TALK TO THEIR FRIENDS ABOUT SEX.<br /><br />If a guy tells you he doesn't? Dump him, because he's lying to you.<br /><br />And then there's Katherine Brooks. Drew's kryptonite. She's smart, ambitious and not about to fall at Drew's feet.<br /><br />Then I flip Kate the finger. Immature, I know, but apparently we're now both functioning at the preschool level, so I'm guessing it's okay. Kate sneers at me. Then she mouths, You wish. Well--she's got me there, now doesn't she?<br /><br />What's so amazing? I love how it's told from Drew's point of view. The narrative is just like he's telling you what happened to him over drinks at your favorite bar. I've read books before from the male's side but never like this. Drew is honest about what he is and makes no apologies. He's crass, arrogant, sometimes disgusting and always humorous.<br /><br />The book opens in the middle of the story and progress' in flashbacks until we are caught up to that point and then finishes out to the ending. I'm not typically a huge fan of this but it works for this story. You don't have to wonder if Drew has changed but are left wanting to know what happened to cause his \\"flu\\". Drew and Kate's goes through many changes throughout the book but she never let him get the best of her and he never gave up on her.<br /><br />The supporting characters are outstanding in their own ways. We meet both Drew and Kate's best friends as well as Drew's family. I don't think there's a cuter 4 year-old than Drew's niece, Mackenzie.<br /><br />\\"She talks like you. It's not every day you hear a four-year-old say Prince Charming is a douchebag who's only holding Cinderella back.<br /><br />That's my girl.\\"<br /><br />Once Drew realized he was in love with Kate it was game on. When a player falls, he falls hard. Tangled is a wonderful lighthearted, funny story in an original point of view that kept me laughing the whole way through. I am in awe that this was Emma Chase's debut and I'm looking forward to her future books.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|All of the songs are good. I listen to this at least once a week all the way through. Enjoy this.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game, it is a stress reliever for me. I can play this game all day long. I even have my husband playing with me.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|AS usual Elvis doesnt disappoint!  The sound is good.  Good CD for the money and well worth the time.  Thanks!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Pleased to find a game that wakes up my brain instead of putting it to sleep.  Increasingly challenging  as well as enjoyable.  Grammar can play along with grandkids
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Not sure if it's worth 1.99 but I have it now. Regardless it is still useful and I love the changing pictures in the background.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Pics art is a great app. You can add all types of designs and texts and frames...anything you can ask for! I recommend this app to anyone who is looking for a result good free, photo editing app! And did I mention? EVERYTHING IS FREE! You don't have to pay anything for extra stuff! This app it's great...YOU HAVE BE TO BUY IT!! If I could, I would rate it 200000000 stars!!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|A little more of a selection on sounds and music would be great otherwise super easy to use. Very happy with it.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|New intrigue with every courtroom episode, but the real story is the continuing saga of &#34;the good wife&#34; and her unfaithful husband, the politician.  Wonderful series.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is awesome I recommend it for all people that my like Greek gods. Rick Riordan did a great vision. For everyone who's likes Percy Jackson this is the best book. Lots of romance, adventure, and battle. Best book in the Percy Jackson series.
1781162646|5.0|I am never disappointed with Stephen King!  I bought this in book form and audiobook.  The reader for the audiobook is great!
B00AYMKUOK|4.0|As like any other George R.R. Martin book im sure this one will be awesome.  However i received the book with the front cover crinkled and messed up on the corners, most likely due to the low quality shipping package that was used. Will go through someone else on my next Amazon book purchase.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|This is not a great movie, but you weren't really expecting that were you?<br />It is true to the G.I. Joe of yesteryear. It has 7th grade humor and a little action. There isn't much of a plot (COBRA wants to take over the world. What a surprise).<br />I enjoyed it for what it was.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|I've been a John Grisham reader for years and I got this for my 11 yr old to read and started it myself and had to finish it before I passed it over for him to read. I enjoyed the book and I'm sure my son will so I'll end up buying the others for him to read.
0374533555|5.0|Simply my favorite nonfiction book of the 21st century.  Daniel Kahneman offers nothing less than the blueprint of human behavior.  While we are probably the only species on earth that has the gift of self-study, most of us (me included) usually squander this priceless ability to step outside our animal instincts and to really think, instead embracing the emotional path of least resistance.  But any reader who desires a deep understanding of why they are the way they are will find it here in Mr. Kahneman's life work.  I have gifted this book to a least 10 people and don't plan to stop any time soon.  A masterpiece of rich, mindblowing information about what it is to be human.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Ok movie. I figured out most of plot early in film. The action was pretty good. The vehicles were pretty awesome too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What more is there to say about this series?  It's among the best science fiction I've ever read.  Just finished Shift, and can't wait for Dust.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Got this replacement cable  as two of our 3 kindle cables  packed up.  Hopefully this one will last longer.  The good thing is the price was reasonable and it was delivered promptly.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Took me a bit to get into the story but once I did, I couldn't stop reading! Clary is a great, true character. Sometimes she is brave, sometimes afraid... sometimes she is protecting and sometimes she needs protecting. Can't wait to finish next book!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Lots of fun playing this game. Can be addictive!  Very good customer support when a glitch caused something to be lost and out of sync. They were right on to address the problem.
B0084670FU|5.0|I thought this was a riveting movie of several interconnected emotional stories.  Worth the watch. 5 more words are required by Amazon for this review: What a cool movie, I...
B005K17RU0|1.0|This was a great app before recent upgrade.  New interface is less useful than before.  Please bring back old interface.  I don't care about videos.  Radar is not easily viewed and forecast is tiny on screen.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|To be honest, it's a miracle that Fringe was on network television for four seasons and that it ended in such a beautiful, meaningful way. Fringe was beautifully written, acted and filmed. It demanded the audience's attention and never dumbed down the show. The mix of sci-fi, philosophy, and familial relations is truly landmark television. Watch it. Over and over again.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I keep my groceries, to do list, house project needs, notes an directions.  Still learning what I can do with this app.  A must app for a Kindle HD and seniors.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's a really great app it has awesome amazing fun and cool things u have to figure it out it is a fun Thinking game love it!!!!!!!!<br />Please try this game out it is really fun
0151003084|5.0|Edward Gorey is one of my favorite authors. Children's alphabet books are an interest of mine and his is by far the awesomest!
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Zombie dice is one of those games that I normally roll my eyes at and think \\"oh no, another boring gimmick game to capitalize on fad ____\\"<br /><br />Then I actually played it, and this game is surprisingly enjoyable in its simplicity.<br /><br />I had been expecting just D6s with cutesy replacements for the numbers. Instead, I got a fun little game to play with friends while we wait for the rest of the gang.<br /><br />How the game works:<br /><br />One player goes first. You have 13 dice in a can. The player shakes it, takes out 3 dice, and rolls them.<br />Brains go to the left. Brains are your score when your turn is over. The first to 13 brains wins.<br />Footsteps go to the middle. They will be the dice the player re-rolls if they choose to continue.<br />Shotgun blasts go to the right. 3 shotgun blasts means the player loses their turn as well as any brains acquired during it.<br /><br />At the end of every roll, the player must decide if they wish to continue or to stop and enjoy the brains they have. Therein lies the risk of winning or losing all of your brains this turn.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Absolutely blown away by this novel. As a plant/flower lover it held even more meaning. Shows that you can ruse above and make something beautiful from a bad situation.
B004SBX112|3.0|Had to pay for it since the free version is JACKED UP and freezes every time an ad pops up. It's not great.
0143124544|3.0|I had heard so much about this novel, I couldn't wait to read it! I read it in one sitting. It was incredibly well-written but just not my cup of tea unfortunately.
B005KAH7QU|4.0|Never new it existed. It was a good flick and very interesting movie. I think I will rent more in the future
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Not meant for people under the age of 15<br /><br />Gruesome at many points during the book<br /><br />An okay book to me
B00D2K40WY|4.0|My girls love playing this. Unless u purchase the full version u can only play with Jenny and are limited on what u can do.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Always amazing. Cannot look away. And cannot wait until season 3 finally comes out on blu-ray. Until then, I'll just have to keep rewatching seasons 1 and 2.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I have this game on my galaxy S3 and it rocks.  Great controls, fantastic graphics and rock-solid gameplay. Spot on touch-screen controls. Great fun, highly recommended.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Always amazing. Cannot look away. And cannot wait until season 3 finally comes out on blu-ray. Until then, I'll just have to keep rewatching seasons 1 and 2.
0770437400|5.0|excellent narrative storytelling. Zombie apocolypse meets the geopolitics and cultures of humanity head on, and humanity reacts accordingly. I would recommend this book not only to fans of the Zombie genre, but to anyone interested in history, politics, diplomatic relations, public health, or spread of disease pandemics as well.
0770437400|5.0|Great book! If you've seen the movie, you will enjoy the book!  If you're a Zombie fan you will love the different take on them.
B0000047CX|5.0|I was enjoying Everything But the Girl's version of Corcovado when I discovered that there was a much older original version...this CD is like summer put to music
B004UID2LC|1.0|Don't really understand what it is for. Does it mean that I can download a video or other attractions on you tube?
B00006JIA4|5.0|ALL MY FAVS IN ONE INEXPENSIVE SET. DON'T HAVE TO BUY ALL THE CDS AND NO WASTING MONEY ON CLUBS OR PAWN SHOP HUNTING.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn has been one of my favorate writers and have read a number of his books. Always good reading.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|I am not one to typically write an amazon review at all. However, this album took me by surprise. A last minute find when looking for new music. I have always been a fan of Mike Portnoy's other projects(Dreamtheater, Avenged Sevenfold, Adrenaline Mob). Upon finding this album I also found that The Winery Dogs were playing a show in my town(Newton, NJ) the next night. I was sure to pick up a copy of this album and was pleasantly surprised. Some people may flag this album as generic. However, it has unique style and sound when you listen deeply to the album's sound. The guitar and bass work is rather incredible. This was also my first exposure to Billy Sheehan and Richie Kotzen. Seeing them live made this the album of the year for me. Last year(2012) was Periphery's release.<br /><br />The performance blew me away in the small theater that they played in. Billy does things with the Bass that I have never seen before. Richie has some of the best guitar work. Also, he is a great singer. His voice fits right in with the sound of the band. Unlike other bands, they can reproduce the album sound perfectly live.<br /><br />For those who have never seen Mike Portnoy on the drums, he is one of the more entertaining drummers to watch. The same goes for Billy and Richie<br /><br />I cannot pick a true standout track from this album. There are too many to choose from. It is rare to see an album this complete with good music. Typically in this generation of music, I only notice 2 or 3 good tracks from a band. This album is full of good tracks.<br /><br />I would highly recommend picking this up as this has been in a constant loop within my CD/MP3 player. My only hope is that this band sticks together as Mike has a tendancy to jump between projects.
034580404X|5.0|I am yet to read these but they arrived in great shape and look nice on my bookshelf...hope to read soon!
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|My daughter loves Ghost Whisperer and I could only find it only online.  Thanks for making her day and mine!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I &hearts; this app! The creaters (Kiloo) recently added a new thing with keys which is like gems in Temple Run 2. It does that &quot;Save Me&quot; thing which I &hearts;! It also has different themes like Australia, China, Italy... and it has very cool power-ups that are very different.  I hope you &hearts; this app as much as I do
B008DYZKQE|5.0|I read this book as a kid. It was always one of my favorites and to this day I still carry the message with me. I was excited when I found it in ebook form. I'm really looking forward to reading it to my baby girl.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest it is so addictive though I spend hours on here.WARNING FOR NEW USERS:Hope you have alot of time on your hands you will be addicted too.
B007H7XJD4|4.0|i liked it...there were a few points where i said, um.....that doesn't fit right....but all in all it was a good action flick for a late night, can't sleep movie. No it's not epic, it's not perfect in more than a few points...but i enjoyed it. hell, might even watch it again some time. All in all, not bad.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My daughter and I watched this together and we love it! The music and the story is great. Good job again disney
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|This book is brilliant......and stupid.<br />DisBelief can be successfully suspended for much of the book....then somewhere in the middle - you feel like the entertaining TV movie turns into a shameless infomercial for gays, lesbians, animal rights activists and misfits.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was surprised that there was such a good story behind all the racy stuff in this series. I loved it
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I LOVE the characters and drama!  And the suits!  What is going to happen between Rachel and Mike Ross?!  So good!
B0051XQI84|5.0|My three year old watched this movie over and over during our rental period. We love it!  Awesome kids movie
B002L5CNRA|5.0|This one just was a good story about growing up in the Bronx but was a bit sad at the end.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|The acting by all was good.  Nice story but not believable.  Boys coming of age and learning about the real world had some truth to it.
8866135879|5.0|I like the smallest moleskin planner because it is easy to carry with me. I find things faster using this paper calendar than my colleagues do using their phones!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Ok for the imagination and you will have to really like the scifi flicks.<br />So far he whole family can watch.
0307341550|5.0|Gillian Flynn is one of my all time favorite authors I read all three of her books and I am looking forward to whatever else she's going to put out there
B004UID2LC|1.0|This application is not what I thought.  A single press does not activate the video, I had to long press then select from a list of options view the video. Once you selected the option you desire, the only options available are a few for downloading the video content or view HQ.  If, your internet connection is low speed you can't view the video in HQ without it pausing to buffer, then the pause button doesn't work for manual selection. Not satisfied.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Well cast, moves along with ease and different plots.  A little more realistic plots would greatly enhance and let people see real life.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I am 45 and somehow I had not read this novel.  My book club chose this book and it was a great conversation!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like that this app is free and isn't interrupted by ads! lots of games and levels to play. very fun.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is an innovative series and I love the dynamic between the actors playing Sherlock and Watson.  Good update to the literary inspiration.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Sometimes hard but if you persevere and do not mind undoing you can always win. Unless you hit the done instead of undo.
B00BY8DIT2|3.0|I've had this for some time, I always give an album many listens before passing judgement.  After the brilliance of \\"Can't Explain\\" I must say I was seriousy disappointed in this album.  Beth Hart is brilliant as usual but the rest not so much.  Bonamassa does a little good work but mostly reverts to his usual overly self-indulgent guitar excesses.  The material choices are not so great either. I do really like \\"Close To My Fire\\" and a few others but \\"Them Ther Eyes\\" and \\"Strange Fruit\\", really?  After Billie Holliday why bother?
B0001ARCFA|5.0|They are worth having any I'm amazed they sound very good  I recommend  anybody to buy them for that price
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I use Kindle Fire and Flipboard is the best. Big pictures for Facebook integration. The best app for news junkie. It adapts with your reading.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very fun good game, just started to play it and I enjoy it along with the kids. Forgot some key things the tutorial teaches you but, figured it out easily
B0094GW6YE|5.0|one of kiss best album ever!!!!<br />i'm a true kiss FAN...<br />looking forward to the tour and<br />great music to come
B004LROUNG|4.0|This is a four star book because of the length.  The beginning was a little tedious, but I am glad that I stuck with it.  The last portion of the story was worth waiting for.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game makes you think... just wish there were more levels!  Keeping an eye out for more!  Can y o u escape makes you think! &amp; May drive you a little batty in the process lol
B00EEXPDTM|4.0|Well-done! The actors were fantastic and the story was compelling, although painful to watch at moments. It was nice to actually learn about the actress behind the $600 million-grossing &#34;Deep Throat&#34; and not just marginalized her as &#34;that actress who did THAT movie.&#34;
B0034JKZ86|5.0|SOO EXCITED MY MOVIE CAME FAST IT WAS IN WONDERFUL CONDITION MY DAUGHTER HAS WATCHED IT ATLEAST 50 TIMES ALREADY... GREAT PRICE TOO!!!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Front line commander d-day is one of the best app game I've ever had and thanks for making this awesome game
B009R89HY6|5.0|I love the style of author's description. It can develop my point of view how to face the music in my life! Thanks!
0553801473|5.0|This grabs my attention much better than book 4 did. Probably because all my favorite characters are in this book.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I'm officially hooked! Can't wait to read book three, I have a feeling it will also be read in one sitting.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|They Eye of God: A Sigma Force Novel is one great roller coaster ride beginning on page one and never stopping. Once again the Sigma group has a very short time to save the world from destruction.  While some of the quantum science and dark energy discussions were hard to get a handle on, the story moves along nicely.  There are some unbelievable escapades by the characters, but the story keeps you so engrossed in it that you don't roll your eyes very often.  Included in the story are a couple of developing love stories and a couple of surprising sad episodes.  This book includes just about everything a reader needs to spend a few exciting hours.  If you enjoy nearly indestructible characters, scientific fantasy, fast-paced thrills, history and a little love story thrown in, then this book is for you.  Buckle up and enjoy the ride!
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|Great story line. He writes in a manner that paints a vivid picture as to what the characters are going through. It covers a wide range of emotions and seems realistic.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was an interesting book to read when you are bored. And when you need something to do and that's great.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|One of the best books I've read in awhile -- very well written and a plot that kept me up at night turning pages.  Very compelling story -- some of the plot twists and turns felt a little contrived, but overall I could not put this book down, and that's a rarity for me.  Deeply felt characters and I had tons of empathy for them, I don't know who I related to more, the mother or the father, but every parent should read this book -- you will relate.  Very powerful.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|This is an ok game and a good time killer but nothing is quite as good as the original Tetris..<br />I got it free and it is definitely worth that.  It is not my go to game when I have a minute to kill<br />but is a good backup.
B007VDN1PA|3.0|Scanner works fairly well but some slides get stuck and are hard to remove.  Scanner also does not scan 100% of older square image slides from 60's & 70's.  Sometimes I had to turn the slide sideways so a head was not cut off.  Scanner is very hard to feed old negatives through.  If the negatives have any curvature to them they get stuck and won't move past the first negative on a section of three.  A lot of mine are curled so this was a pain.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I didn't think I would like reading about children killing children, but I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to see what was going to happen next!  I will read the rest in this series.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|To be honest I didn't watch it but my 15 year old did and she loved it.  The movie is age appropriate and I had to wait forever to buy it after I saw the trailer for it but it was worth the wait.  This is the kind of movie you can have at a slumber party and it wont freak your young kids out.
B000T433CO|5.0|Even Jack Black isn't over the top in this one.<br />Add the lovely Kate Winslet, and what's not to like?!?
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|It is a really fun game.  You can play in &#34;brain dead&#34; phase or really go for it.  Try this one out!!
B002AWX6UM|4.0|Every young men & women should read it. It is a window to a different world of survival! I liked the way the author express the ever-ending  story vividly. I wished he mentioned what happened to his uncle's family and his life in America.
B007N31ZKQ|5.0|What can I say?  The Big Lebowski - cult classic, Coen brothers.  I love it!<br /><br />This review is about Amazon customer service.<br /><br />Be careful with these \\"digital copies\\" that come with movies.  It's not just a simple download.  You don't just go to the website shown on the redemption slip and download your movie.  In fact, as far as I can see, you never physically possess a digital copy, unless you can rip it as it is streaming or something.  No, the redemption site asks you to choose a vendor and then you get a redemption code for that vendor.  Then you go to that vendor with your code and this gets your movie delivered to your library, not to your computer.  If all goes well, that is.<br /><br />I chose Amazon, since that's where I bought the boxed set.  My \\"digital copy\\" redemption did not go well, however -- I got charged 10 bucks.<br /><br />I immediately emailed customer service with a complaint.  Bright & early next morning was a reply from an actual person, who said that I'd been charged because the expiration date for the \\"free digital copy\\" had expired.  This was in July.  I explained that the expiration date shown on the redemption slip in the boxed set was Dec. 31, 2013, and that if there was some sort of mix-up it was not at my end, but rather a miscommunication between Amazon and Universal (the movie company).<br /><br />The customer service gal apologized for the inconvenience, immediately credited my account, and simultaneously fired me off a good Amazon redemption code for the movie.  Now, anyone can make a mistake (the botched redemption code), but fixing a mistake so quickly and painlessly for the customer is fine service, if you ask me.  Kinda old-fashioned in today's world, but I'm an old-fashioned kind o' guy.<br /><br />You are not \\"out of your element\\" with Amazon's customer service.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am no good at this game.  I wish I was it so cute.  I can't wait for my grandson to try it!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game!!! I wish there were some more levels though. :) Everyone should get this game!!!! It's so fun!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book is so worth reading.<br />I read this in one night! The book caught me right away.<br />The twist at the end was really good...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fantastic game. I was disappointed to find out there is only ten levels and you have to wait for more. I would recommend this game.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|I'm a big fan of Mickey Haller and his brilliant yet unorthodox ways of getting almost killed and his clients off! Such a fun way to sit through a trial. Is it possible that this could be educational?
B001I45UFC|5.0|It's just cs Lewis awesome his next book is even better also has good nonfiction as well. This one is defiantly a good read.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Only “free&#34; until you run out of credits. Then, one must purchase credits to continue playing. The game is just not good enough to pay for......deleted it from my kindle.......
B00BB8UJKG|3.0|Some messages about commitment, but with a bit of silly stuff stretching it out. The rules say I have to say more, so I am.
B00634GHJA|1.0|I have tried and tried and still cannot get this program to work. As it is today it is a piece of garbage. If I can't get it to work soon, I'm going to delete it from my phone and computer.

B007D2XSW0|5.0|It is so much fun to play with and makes awesome photos. If I had to I would use it as a program on a computer
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie was heart-wrenching to watch! I cried numerous times and I'm not one to be moved by movies. FIVE STAR acting and directing!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I have recently installed this APP and I have not had any problems to date. I have the 7\\" HD KINDLE. I get good battery life so far but I have noticed that the KINDLE appears to switch itself on while set for charging even after closing it by the off button and it appears that this prevents the KINDLE fully charging. I also make sure the internet is off as this drains the battery considerably and is well known.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's really awesome and very addicting. Just keep upgrading. Bananas are your friend. Get the golden banana update. It's worth the actual money. You will do fine without it but it's an awesome way to get bananas quickly.
0793573742|5.0|Not only does it have so many color pictures of 58's 59's @60's it also goes into great detail about how the wood is picked, cut,@ matched it also contains useful info about the pickups,hardware ect. I could not put it down. Try it you will like it.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|All of the very bad reviews of this movie almost made me pass on seeing it. I'm glad I went ahead anyhow. I thought this was a very good film and couldn't find anything to validate the faults others found in it. Cruise and Freeman were perfectly casted and the script was tight and and actually original in its concept. Plenty of action and some very unexpected plot twists. Also a good though understated soundtrack. I've already recommended this film to several friends and will no doubt watch it again myself. I won't offer spoilers but the ending caught me completely off guard. That's what made this movie stand out for me - it wasn't predictable and formulaic. Which is more than you can say for 90% of big Hollywood films these days, especially in the sci-fi genre.
B00459EZLW|5.0|Clearly the best series in the Stargate franchise. The network did a crappy job of promoting and scheduling this show.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Worked on a picture in my phone's gallery, saved it.  Where it went from there I have no idea.  Apparently I'm not the only one. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S3. Glad I didn't waste money on this.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game had our whole family in stitches. We  watched my grandsons playing it. They had a ball. We were all laughing by the time the quit playing.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|An amazing CD and I look forward to its sequel. Star-studded guest features and of course, the music is superb.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play this game every day. Lots of fun. Beats keeping track of paper cards. A good challenge. Love the game.
0307346617|5.0|I like short story collections and was instantly drawn to World War Z. The different perspectives and experiences outlined in this memoir of sorts is engaging and makes you want to keep reading. Note, it is nothing like the movie so if you didn't like the movie, please still read the book.
1452101248|5.0|Imaginative cookbook with many intriguing recipes.  My wife and I have tried a number of the recipes and found them very satisfying.  I would like to get Ottolenghi's other books as well.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Will not save on my Jelly Bean devices. Will save on my Ice Cream Sandwich and Gingerbread devices but will only save to camera folder and not the biggest file sizes, only super high and below. I did manage to save one and super high took a 5MB+ photo and compressed it to 83kb when all I did was fiddle with the focal point a smidge.<br />If there is ever an update to fix these issues I'll be more than happy to edit my review to a higher rating and tell of bugs fixed. As of now it is useless to me for my wants.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Not the strongest in the series, however still pretty great. Events take place during the same time as &#34;A Feast for Crows&#34;. I found a few people online who have written a chapter guideline which, in essence, merges the two books. In that way you read the two as one super novel. I'm gonna do that. I think I can handle it. I took honors English in college. Well, it was junior college and I didn't finish my degree, but whatever... #bluecollar4life
B000P407K4|5.0|Every viewing of this movie yields a deeper understanding of storytelling and how a master storyteller is able to build a greater more fulfilling vision using the fewest amount of moving parts possible.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I read the Thomas Harris books and enjoyed them, and I think this series does a great job portraying Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter.
B005KAH7QU|2.0|Didnt finish the movie because I found it boring and it was not compelling. Dont waste your time with this movie.
B003NF0G12|5.0|After finally seeing this movie on TV, I thought this was such a good story that I wanted it as part of my DVD library. Too bad it isn't Blu Ray, but the Widescreen version is perfectly fine.
B0084TWN9K|2.0|The author is certainly a talented writer who can evoke time, place, and atmosphere well.  We get the little details that really draw us into the stories. The problem is that all the stories are rather sad, with a sense of isolation.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I agree with the others... It doesn't save. It looks like it did but I can't find the file anywhere. BOO HISS BOO!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It's. a good game but the hints cost way 2 much! That is the only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 star rating.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It has great graphics and the game play is great &middot; You should have dragon ball z game.  I would recommend this to others
B004J713JW|5.0|Very well done. This blu-ray is one entire concert, along with 3 of the guests that appeared at the other concerts that weekend. Definitely worth the money - Billy Joel works hard for the money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids enjoy playing it. it keeps them entertained and they are always spending time together I always hear the laughing.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is fantastic.  I encourage everyone to use it.  Personally my favorite thing is making a picture in a picture frame.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I was a bit confused, I had thought I was ordering thwe actual DVD but it never came.  I was able to watch it on my computer though. Please e mail me to clear up this confusion.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|huge fan of x-men! have all the movies and love to watch them over and over again! love Wolverine! :-)
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Deleted.<br />Thought it would be great for my daughter to play, installed it and it made my kindle freeze. Took 2 days for my kindle to hard reset.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely loved it. I hope to be able to see season four soon! It was interesting, humerous, and truely heartfelt.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game with fantastic graphics and a long plot line. A pleasurable gaming experience. Thanks for another fun game Big Fish. I cant wait to play the sequel.
0525952926|5.0|A little slow getting into it w/all the charcter's younger years, but once you get to the meat of the story it's fantastic.
B000P407K4|5.0|1960's fear mongering over something that never happened...but delivered in a period funny people faced with funny situations.  I love it.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|If you like him, this CD will not disappoint. Listen as he adds his own signature style to some old standards, the whole time remembering to respect the material. No distortion s here, he covers the old ones beautifully and introduces some first class new ones.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love John Green's books so this may be a little biased. Highly recommended read. Would re-read it again. Great BOOK!!
B000H4TX9I|4.0|Took me a few minutes to figure out what the heck was going on, but once I did, I was hooked. This requires your attention. The characters are surprising and multi layered as is the story. Good series!
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Applause is the first single from Lady Gaga's new album ARTPOP. It will make you dance until you drop and then get you back up again. PUT YOUR HANDS UP MAKE EM TOUCH!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I vacillated between the rating of &#34;I hate it&#34; & &#34;I don't like it&#34; on this novel.  I went with &#34;I don't like it&#34;  because I thought the story lines was interesting; however, there were too many inconsistencies and coincidences throughout the book.  I hated the ending of the story; I felt like the author got to the end of the novel and just gave up and in turn so did her main character.  Why would he work so hard to clear his name and then just throw in the towel?  I have the 2nd book of this trilogy but it's been placed on the end of my list of books to read; maybe if I have no other books and no online service to purchase a new book will I then venture to read her 2nd book of the Gone Girls trilogy.
B00CEF014E|1.0|I have a difficult time believing people actually gave this story 5 stars!  The plot behind this novella is a good one.  That's the nicest thing I can say about it.  Instead of taking us from A to B the author goes from A to D and you're wondering what you missed.  Lots of small stuff left unexplained which I could live with and use my imagination.  So many mistakes.  For instance in one scene someone is introducing their sister to their adopted child and actually introduced themself.  Biggie was needing a lantern and in just a short time the sun is going down! I'm thankful this was free when I got it.
B004NS710C|5.0|Our entire family love this movie!!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat and renews yours faith in humanity at the same time.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Best show on TV, can not wait until next episode.<br />Smart, funny good story line.<br />Characters are interesting and type casting is perfect.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I waited & waited for this book to come out, then I saw the review's... I held out and then figured I had already invested in the two prior books. I had to see the story through. I feel ripped off @ $8.99 you owed way more than what was delivered Sylvia Day! Also, Entwined is one of the most costly ebooks out right now. One would think it would be properly edited, containing no typo's and would be grammatically correct... Another disappointment!
B007L5LD9O|5.0|Awesome movie.  I never get tired of watching it over and over again.  I have always loved period pieces.  Beautiful
B0090X4GLW|3.0|i mean i guess it's ok... got the cd specifically for the Cup song. Was not really wowed by the rest of the Cd. Did not live up to the hype.
0061122416|1.0|I just finished the alchemist and after hearing nothing but good things I have to say, I was so relieved it was over. Had this book been any longer than it is I think I may have given up with it much sooner/gone insane.<br />I am unsure where and how this book gained such popularity. To me it is just drivel, total nonsense... and nothing really appears to happen.<br />Personally I struggled to find a plot or a character with any depth, the story consists of ridiculous characters banging on about \\"dreams\\" and \\"destiny\\" - all this spiritual talk amounts to fulfilment of materialistic dreams, even if lessons were learnt along the way - I was expecting a stronger message considering all the excellent reviews.<br />Not for me!
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|I liked the book, but am going to try one of her other books before I pass judgement.  The blogs got tedious and I found myself thumbing through them to get back to the story...interesting perspective that I wouldn't otherwise know about Nigeria .
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|It could have more challenges levels before the story end plus. plus a part 2 to the game.History lesson after each successful task.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|What a great story.. I cannot stress this enough. it's been years since I've experienced such a wide range of emotions while reading a book. Since finishing Delirium, I find myself wanting to tear into Pandemonium and see what the future holds for Lena (the main character) and those close to her heart!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I really love this book. Pam Grout is easy to read and I have used several of the experiments and find them all working. I will be a follower of hers for sure. Keep the good work going Pam.
B004XQO90O|3.0|It wasn't as enjoyable as Looper.  Or Minority Report. And I can't put my finger on why I didn't like it more.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Want more floors. My grandson that is five loves this game. Not cause it is easy, though, it is not that simple
B00338QENI|3.0|I had to do this book for a report and I thought that it was written pretty well. Sure, it still has some boring parts, but all books have them. Overall, if you want to read this for fun, you should be interested in cells and be at least 14 to understand most of this book.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really love this game I play it on FB all the time and I love that I can play it on my kindle now too. I did sync it with my account since I had so many extra lives it is a great way to pass the time.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Don't ever read a good author and expect a movie of his (or her) book (any book) to turn out.  What a laugh.  Should have known I wouldn't have been able to stomach it when I learned who was starring.  Spent $4.99 so forced myself to the bitter end.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|It's Doctor Who. You can't go wrong with Doctor Who. David Tennant is brilliant as the tenth incarnation of the Doctor and Donna is a worthy companion. A great season.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|This game isn't as complex as some others I've played but it's challenging enough to be entertaining and the price is right.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Only wish would report next days humidity, not just the current days humidity otherwise it is very convenient for planning activities
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I don't think I've ever read a novel as quickly as I have read \\"Pines\\". I don't know how I read 320 pages in 3 days. But, when a book is so engrossing, so mysterious, and unpredicatable as \\"Pines\\" it makes sense. From beginning to end this book kept me thoroughly engaged, turning page after page into the wee hours of the night. This, nothing-as-it-seems story of an agent lost in an obscure and strange town tries to find the truth behind everything. And, keeps the reader on his toes as everything is a mystery, totally unpredictable, full of adventure, thrill, and the unknown.<br /><br />I have found a new author I like, and a new series that I look forward to getting. I highly recommend this book to anyone who liked movies and TV shows such as: The Village, The X-Files, The Twilight Zone, and Twin Peaks. Where nothing is as it seems.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this bingo game just wish the collection items were offered more often. The customer support is great when the game gets frozen.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Game of Thrones is easily one of the greatest shows in television history. And I've only watched the first season! Cannot wait to start on season two!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like that it is age appropriate, no Facebook required for young player's missions. Occasional sales and weekly challenges. Great fun for moms and kids. Very cute too, lots of fun to play, perhaps too addictive...
B002361MLA|5.0|I tried once before to read this book, but I was not able to put my head into the message.  This time I was fully prepared and took it quite slow and felt a connection that moved me forward to learn more.  I enjoyed it and will read it again to gain more insight.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|don't just stand there. DOWNLOAD NOW. HURRY UP BEFORE ITS LATE AND THEY PUT THIS APP AS TO BUY.I PUT ALL LOVE IN THIS GAME.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|So well written.  The plot was moving along so fast.  I still want to read more.  This was a very easy read.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Never had the FAOTD prompt me to open upon first look.  Ironically I just reinstalled this yesterday, was looking for something with a few filters as I was trying to create an old timey feel to a Facebook profile pic. Problem is I don't see any benefits that this app provides for $5 you would miss from  instagram or the millions of other copy cats. I downloaded it because I already owned it and it works.  My phone with an 8mp camera&nbsp;takes&nbsp;crappy pics just like every other smartphone and tablet out there and sadly any editing software can only be as good as the medium you start with.  Good luck. I'm just bummed that amazon is recycling apps. We had a good run!
B008XG1X18|4.0|It has a few issues when used on the kindle (freezing, slow respond) but overall works well. I use it almost daily.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Good background.  Love the nods to the original movies... if your a Plant of the Apes fan, you'll get them and enjoy the placement of them.
B008L5G4I8|4.0|Anything by Agatha Christie interests me. This was no exception. Brilliant lady and<br />brilliant plot!  Will read more of hers.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I love love love this movie! The music is awesome! I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie! It arrived quickly and was in great shape!
B00B32X786|2.0|I wanted to like this movie, because I liked the actors.  Unfortunately, it played like the author was trying to share a tale of woe, based on their own life experience.  The story begins with a young man returning home for a class reunion.  As he kept running into old friends, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. However, the only thing remotely thought provoking was his odd attraction to the precocious tweenager next door.  As the credits rolled, the only thing I could think was, &#34;What was that?&#34;
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Love the game addicted to it and so will u be recommending to all gamers and players in my life and
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show.  I was having trouble finding it online so I could catch up.  So glad I found it on Amazon.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|WOW,where have i been never heard of him before,i am 69 an never ever heard of him,i love all music except Rap,this CD is the best,love his voice,an all of the songs,got it today,an have been playing it for hours,will have to get some more of his CD's real soon,if it wasn't for the e-mail from Amazon,i would have missed a very fine singer.Thanks
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Something out of the ordinary and a great follow-up to The Boondock Saints!  Too bad they didn't make a third movie . A TRILOGY would have been GREAT !
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The characters are very real, full of conflicts, they get into all kinds of trouble, but basically they are all<br />good hearted people that you can't help but love.  I got hooked on this series more than any other<br />that I have watched.  The first 3 seasons are free and were so good that I was willing to pay for<br />each episode of season 4.  I never wanted it to end, but I must admit that the ending was so<br />clever and unexpected.  I hope there is a season 5.  I will be looking out for that.<br />Great diversity of characters.  How could you not love this show?  Watch out -- easily addictive.<br />Sara
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I was hooked from the first episode! Suits has wonderful character and story development, and each episode makes you want to watch the next one right away!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love these episodes. The acting is superb. What a place to live!  I am looking forward to watching Season 4
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Always a family favorite, I streamed this via Roku and was highly impressed with video and audio quality.  Looks and sounds great!
B005GIS1SY|5.0|I rented this for my 6 month old daughter because she loves colors and music.  What's not to like for a baby?...
B000QXDEDG|5.0|Such a great movie I was compelled to have a copy especially in Blu Ray for viewing during trips etc.
0743277708|5.0|I loved  this book! I was a little worried that it would be more geared towards children, and might be too \\"light\\" for me. I was wrong! I was completely absorbed in the story, and the characters were SO well developed that you just grow totally attached to them. It's amazing how Adams has literally created a world and a culture for rabbits, it seems realistic!<br /><br />I'd recommend this book for any reader. I'd love to read this to my kids one day too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Omg I love it everyone should get it. its challenging and addictive and fun if you dont get it your a loser
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a great game if you like temple run. gives you different things to do like fighting vector and switching up the view to make it more challenging. lots of fun!
B002WD4MLG|5.0|This is a funny, intelligent movie.  The acting is first rate - especially Dennis Farina.  Get it, and be entertained.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I thought it was a good science fiction movie Oblivion made you think anything in the future could happen very good
B006RXPYXM|5.0|Do yourself a favor--get this movie. 'Tis a tale, told by experts, full of impassioned acting, signifying... a great film!
0061992860|3.0|Not much bigger than the picture.<br />3 1/4\\" L<br />4 1/2\\" H<br />7/8\\"  W<br /><br />Meaning, this is good in a back pocket or jacket. Though a durable ziplock back will help protect it. It's colored which is good especially in the plants and animal sections. Could you use it while camping? Sure. At such a low cost and portable size, think any camper, hiker, biker, or prepper would benefit from having this on them. The Army has taught me many things, on of which is:<br />better who have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.
B00594XOZU|3.0|The app itself is great, but the problem is, I can't update it on the kindle fire. Maybe you could fix that?
B004UID2LC|4.0|I download videos when I am on wi-fi, then watch them at a later time so that I do not use up my data plan. Sometimes a bit glitchy, but hey, works for what I need. And it's free.
0307591549|5.0|A great book to really give you an uptempo outlook.<br /><br />Great job, too bad they didn't offer this course at my school.<br /><br />Good Read, Get It.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Good for quick checklists and easy to use. I like that it saves my lists - Christmas List can be reused every year :)
1401938906|5.0|I am currently staying in the absolute &#34;middle of nowhere&#34; while waiting on a house in a more &#34;civilized&#34; part of the country.  Even being in the &#34;outback&#34; of America, the Exercises WORK!!  I am always very skeptical at first and by the time I am half way or mosdt of the way through the Exercise the &#34;objective&#34; suddenly appears.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius has a great selection of songs on this album. Album needs a warning lable as it does cause people to sing along, and loud!
B00846REIS|5.0|I love it!! The love story is great. Give me Gideon Cross any time. Gideon is sexy,  determine and most of all he loves  Ava is his one true love. Can't wait for Captivated by you.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I gave this film 5 stars because it celebrates life and the human condition. I highly recommend it for anyone whose is or has dealt with the elderly. Who likes and  understands people and also enjoys a charming story well acted and directed.
B009EE4YWI|4.0|I thought it was nicely put together. They used all of my favorite characters of Greek mythology. They also made a nice teen plot in it all.
B004T9T2AC|5.0|It's time to get educated about how money works and rich dad is the only way to educated you out of the rat race.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The features are awesome, you can set music,and hear the news as alarms. Also you can change the color scheme, which is a great. Set the days specific to your needs.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|Generations to come will still enjoy the Backstreet Boys. My Daughters are the next generation and they ordered this album and are wearing it out! Thank You Amazon and BBS
B00CISC2DA|3.0|I somehow own three of their albums so far but I can't say I'm head over heels about any of them.  In general the songs without percussion don't do a lot for me; they're moody I guess but that's about it.  Other people seem to get a lot more out of them...<br /><br />If you've heard any of their previous albums but don't love them this album will not change your mind.  I don't dislike it, but I admit that the only reason I bought it is because of the massive hype (it got a story on NPR for crying out loud).  If you loved their previous albums, well, you already own this, but if for some reason you don't, buy it already!
B000JMKQX0|1.0|There's hundreds of other books to read. Z was so boring, I'm so upset I paid for it.<br />Do not waste your time.<br /><br />Note that I've read several other zombie series, and those authors are awesome!  This book was bad. Very bad.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game there are so many cool things in it. I personally love survivle mod in minecraft it's awesome!!!!!! GET IT NOW!!!!!!!
B000MRAAJW|1.0|sh&(&* i messed up n gave it as a gift HD doesn't exist any more. Dont get it, get blu ray
B0055QYKQO|5.0|My previous motherboard was around 4 years old maybe, a gigabyte Ga-Ma770t-ud3p, and honestly considering i played games on it every day for 4 years (5 i think) straight let me know gigabyte boards are pretty good quality.<br /><br />This new mobo was a replacement for my old one ( pci slots started dying ): ), the temps are generally at 30 degrees celcius although the NB does run a little hot at 45 degrees while doing anything intensive. Boot times are extremely fast with the new UEFI bios and Windows 8. The 4 pci-e slots are placed in good places and don't really block anything else with gfx cards in them.<br />It's a great motherboard to build a gaming rig, and i would recommend this to anyone.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'M SO SAD ITS OVER. I DIDN'T EXPECT  THIS ENDING. WHAT AM I GOING TO READ NOW? I NEED MORE SOOKIE!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It is a fun game, but it lags in some areas and skips a bit when trying to play the missions.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|This movie is very neat-I love stop animation and this one delivers-go watch the making of on YouTube when you are done too, to see all of the amazing work that goes into making one of these cartoons/movies.  The whole family will love this sassy tale of young Coraline, who-well, I won't ruin it for you, just watch it!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Joss Wheton has done a great job in his direction of this movie.<br />The actors all do a solid job in their roles and play off each other quite well
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|Love the hair on this little dude! Paranorman is well-written, cute, funny, and reallly interesting.  Go watch the making of on YouTube when you are done-to see how they make this type of stop-animation movie-very interesting!
B0042TV4IW|2.0|While a  pretty period piece the pace is so slow interest fades fast. Can't figure out how this could have run for two seasons.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Good acting too. Lots of stars. Liked all the excitement, but definately not for the very young or very old.
B009EE4K86|3.0|This one had a much bigger impact on me when it first came out.  Big screen, loud, fantastic story capably told.<br /><br />Then I watched it after a couple of years with my kids, and none of us were amazed the way I had been. It was... fine. But I won't burn any more disposable hours watching it again.<br /><br />Oh, and my daughter pointed out during my second viewing that Gandalf plays Magneto.  That was jarring, for some reason.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is unlike any book I have ever read and I don't want  it to end. I'm hooked beyond belief.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Until the SAVE feature is fixed, don't even bother using this app.  Since it's a FAOTD you can download it and wait for it to be fixed, but until then it's just taking up space.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Really r<br />Www.<br />eally good book can't wait for the next one hope it comes out soon<br /><br />Waiting with baited breath
B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|Ok - my niece and I both laughed.  A lot!  I switched my brain off and just enjoyed this boarder-crossing, drug-smuggling, aww-shucks family of misfits moments movie.  But didn't switch off too much - there were some decent lines and scenes I wanted to squirrel away.  I didn't recognize Jason Sudeikis until he got his \\"dork\\" haircut.  I really enjoyed Jennifer Aniston - she's not the strongest actress is an unneeded criticism.  This is not a strong film - one review I read referred to this film as \\"undemanding\\".  I like that in a summer movie that has a corny premise to begin with.  I really liked the street-smart daughter and best of the bunch: the complete awkward Kenny (Will Poulter).  And a nice twist at the end with the DEA dad and his over-sized metal travel mug.  Oh - sit still for the first few moments into the credits for some outtakes.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It pulls you in and you just can't stop reading. You really start to care about the life of Pi (Piscine Moliter Patel) It makes you look at life a new, different way.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series just keeps gettting better and better. Can't wait for the next season to come out. Hope it continues for a long time.
1451695195|5.0|Wonderful book say the least. Its worth never putting in down as its visceral hubris created a world taking us from simple science to the heavens above.
B00CZF87TY|1.0|\\"Another Irish Drinking Song\\". Great job stereotyping!<br />Why not include \\"Another Islamic Suicide Bomber\\", or :Another Penny Pinching Jew\\".<br />Great example for the nine year old dolts lapping up this crap.
B009B4XSMS|5.0|This band managed to make me buy their all albums double,Meds is just perfect there are not even a single song I love less!
B00EI6E17A|2.0|After a generous helping of self-triumphant hype from Gaga, and endless sycophantic hyperbole from those surrounding her, Applause is disappointing. It's not that it's a bad song, it just sounds dated. This sounds like something from Madonna's MDMA, and although it's a safe bet for Gaga, it's also a dull step back to safer territory. In other words, we've heard it all before. It's catchy and it will sell well, but neither sales nor memorability makes a classic song, they just make a successful one. Fans will no doubt chalk the success of this record up as evidence of a great tune, but the reality is even the worst music sells well if enough people believe the hype. Ultimately, Applause indicates that Gaga's best work is behind her, and even a visit back to that era can't recreate the magic. Let's hope the album pushes the envelope a little more than this lazy effort.

B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Warm Bodies started out pretty slow but it was really cute and had a feel good ending. I don't think I'd buy it because it's not one of those movies I'll watch over and over, but definitely worth a few bucks to rent.
B000ID1J40|3.0|I'm not sure what made me remember this movie and decide to watch it again recently, but the shine was certainly off the rose. This is a good but rather average conspiracy flick.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This was my little brother's favorite movie when we were growing up. It was just as good as I remember!
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Bought this to scan slides.  So far I have had great luck in scanning in slides from the 70s.  Soon will try with negatives it expect as good of results.

B009NPK1IO|5.0|The culmination of events was gratifying in every way after watching all six seasons.  I was only disappointed in the half length season.
B00COHGPWO|5.0|As always Meryl Streep is fantastic. An enjoyable musical to watch. Supporting cast was excellent and very talented. Good value.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|Although I know some things may have been stretched because this is a movie and not a documentary exactly, I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't think it was fake or corny for even 1 moment. The actors chosen were perfect (Anthony Hopkins being the best choice- a perfect Hitchocock). The scenes we see in this movie show Hitchcock's personal life and issues that were haunting him around the time when he decided to direct his arguably most famous movie, Psycho. We got to see the way Hitchcock fell in love with his leading ladies, and how that affected his relationship with his wife.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes came at the end where I felt the scriptwriting was perfect. The movie ends with Hitchcock doing his famous \\"talking to the audience\\" bit. He was speaking as if closing out a short film he had shown. He spoke about how Psycho was his greatest achievement and he was now looking for something even better. Just then, a big, black crow landed on his shoulder as he paused, foreshadowing that The Birds would be his next big movie.<br /><br />I also was able to see how deep Hitchcock got into his films during the scene where he is directing his leading lady in the shower scene of Psycho. He felt as if she wasn't acting scared enough so he took over the knife from the extra and started making the movements himself towards her. In his head he saw all the things that he was mad about, and he saw himself stabbing them out of anger. All the while, the leading lady was screaming from real fear at Hitchcock's sudden reaction.

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|One of the best &#34;self help&#34; books I've ever read. An easy to implement method to remove drama from your life.
B001BKTEZA|3.0|This classic was an eye opener to agriculture and the workers from the past. Yet, don't know that the help is much better off today. High hopes for a family to make it big in West. Promises broken, unfair labor practices and corruption are ever present.<br />I was really disappointed in the ending. It just left you hanging. I guess that&#34;s the idea. Very sad. Strong maternal character, week men with big dreams.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great, fast read! Disappointed when it was over! Can' wait for the next book. Don't start it unless you want to finish because you won't be able to put it down.
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|Wow, I am pleasantly surprised at how much I love this show.  My brother has been trying to get me to watch this for years but I never thought I would be interested in a show about outlaw bikers, who knew?  Based solely on the fact that Charlie Hunnam is so fun to look at (sigh), I decided to give the show a chance and I am so happy I did.  This amazing show is loosely based on Shakespeare's Hamlet.  It's violent for sure and there really are no \\"good guys,\\" but you can't help but root for this crazy gang of outlaws especially Jax.  He's the anti-hero; the criminal with a heart of gold.  Opie is another standout character.  He's like this big lovable bear of a guy you can't help but love.  These guys are murderers but they are killing other bad guys, well most of the time.  Anyway, Jax is a good man as far as being a father to his son.<br /><br />This is an interesting, exciting and dare I say, fun show about outlaw bikers who make their own rules, never conform to society or follow the law and would not hesitate to kill someone who gets in their way.  There are disturbing scenes of violence including rape that are very hard to watch but the writing is incredibly good and I was hooked after episode 1.  Even though the show has its dark and disturbing, it also has its funny moments.<br /><br />I highly recommend this show to any adult who enjoys impeccable writing and an interesting plot; a fantastic show that is actually worth your time in an endless sea of mediocrity on television.
B0053FANS6|5.0|Would recommend it to any family. Very funny and good for a good laugh. I would suggest it for all ages but there is some mild language,.
B005ZO4TOO|5.0|Pop up books are my go to gifts if I'm not sure what the child likes/wants.  I purchased several copies of this book to give during Christmas to children over age 5.  There are many components to the book which I wouldn't suggest giving to any toddlers.  They can easily tear the pages apart and ruin the book. The book also has pages with books tucked into the pockets.  I

B009NOVCSS|5.0|This was a gift to my nephew. He was so surprised, love it. I love the Rolling Stones also. Rock and Roll was here, is here, and will remain here forever! Love the Stones.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Not as good as the first Die Hard but nice to see Bruce Willis take a lickin' and still defeat the bad guys. Good packaging by Amazon
B0020PJJHS|4.0|One has to suspend one's knowledge about the &#34;real world&#34; and just go with the flow. I have always thought Brosnan was much better than Moore as Bond. I've seen them all, the early one several times!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Got it as free app of the day. Not too bad...haven't played all that much, but it seems like an adequate editor. The save issue that others mentioned must be fixed because they saved fine on my Fire HD.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|i would recommend this movie to any Trekkie who wants to stay current with the franchise.<br />My DVD arrived on time and I am happy to have it.
B00AYLTXQC|5.0|This is a great movie.  I liked the characters in the movie.<br />it was a amazing story about a man with alot of health problems but<br />still found love.

1451608667|4.0|Off Balance: A Memoir is without a doubt the BEST book I have ever read. Dominique Moceanu poured her heart out in this book. Not only did I laugh and cry, she touched my soul with her memoir! GREAT BOOK!!!!!! The MUST READ book of the year!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when I thought I had it figured out, here comes a twist... then another and another! Great book. I wish I could unread it and read it again. Definitely would reccomend to read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This Series is so good!! I highly recommend it to everyone. I can't wait for season four to start. There is defiantly mature content so it's not for children.
B003DT194G|5.0|This is a great movie produced by Sergio Leone who is the same person that produced The Good,The Bad And The Ugly.This movie ihas Charles Bronson cast as a guy who has spent his whole life seeking revenge,Has Henry Fonda as the bad guy,Jason Robards whose motives are questionable.Has a couple of slow drawn-out spots but overall is a great movie.Thoroughly enjoyed it and would reccomend it to all Western fans.
B001C2QU6S|4.0|I bought 3 sets of these cards at one time and shuffled them together.  Sometimes I pick a card per day; other days I leave a particular affirmation on top for several days at a time.  Louise Hay is creative in finding new ways to say positive things!

B00377V6J2|4.0|I was on an Eric Clapton kick when I bought this and that interest led me to Albert King.  This recording with Stevie Ray Vaughan was interesting because he died to young and left such a legacy.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Slow moving and boring. Morgan Freeman's part was small.  It irritates me that most of the dialogue between Tom Cruise and his leading ladies is &#34;whispering&#34;.  Why can't they talk like normal people ?
B002HWRYJE|5.0|At first when they said they were rebooting the Star Trek franchise, I was very skeptical. But they did it with style and a great storyline. Nimoy is the only original cast member here. But Chris Pine and company do a great job becoming the crew of the Enterprise. Simon Pegg as Scotty? I was not down with that at first, but he does a great job in the part.
B008JEJPSC|5.0|Bought this for my kids as once again I go to this original version being much better then the &#34;New and Improved&#34; version!
B009MF56GC|5.0|What a hoot, never thought a movie could have this much action and be funny too. All the big action stars are in this at one time or another. Watch for Van Damme as the bad guy.  Even Schwarzeneggar is more than a little fun in this one.
B0037QGRZG|5.0|I bought this for my kids as I think this is a much better version then the &#34;New and Improved&#34;
B0032KNA4I|5.0|The special effects are what really make this movie good. The acting is good but the shots of the earth basically blowing apart are awesome. Watch for Woody Harrelsons demise on a mountain top!

B009VIZDLI|5.0|The Rosie Project is a delight to read from start to end. It is witty, funny and heart warming and I'll definitely read it again. A few other best sellers that I've read this year dealt with quite dark topics and I turned the pages with dread. With this book, I turned the pages with glee!

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I picked up this book mainly because I had heard of the story and the movie adaption soon to be released and wanted to read it before I saw the film. I cannot imagine the movie being 1/10th as good or detailed as this story was. As a fellow veteran, I salute Marcus and his fellow teammates for their relentless drive and undying dedication to our great nation

B005VMSATA|3.0|Ryan Reynolds does a competent job as a love interest in most romantic comedies. Every once in a while, he gets cast in a film that is way above his skill level. Couple that with a tepid story line and this is a film you probably won't pause when you get up to fix a drink or use the restroom. Origin stories are supposedly the finest offerings in Hollywood today. Hopefully, they will find another outlet for entertainment besides rehashing the same stories over and over again.
B008D1LVRY|5.0|This entire CD is a vulgar display of ********* power!  8-)  It's not Pantera, but it's the next best option especially nowadays.  The vocals are piercing like a serial killer's rage and the drum / guitar work is astounding.  GET IT!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|When I started reading this series, I actually only read it because everyone was raving about it and they were making it into a movie, so I had extreme expectations and knew nothing about the book. It was definitely a page turner. I really did enjoy it. I would have given it 10 stars for the series overall, by the end I was absolutely obsessed but trying to give my honest opinion, the first book was good but it didn't hook me as much as I thought it would and I almost didn't read the second book, but the second book is where I feel like it really gets going and there was no turning back after it :-) it really is an amazing story and one of my all time favorites!
B0092SPYQG|5.0|I'm always torn on albums like this.  While the band offers absolutely nothing you haven't heard a thousand times before, they do incorporate a LOT of the ideas that have been used throughout the last few decades.  I look at it as a recap of every idea that's been thought of before combined in a solid hard rock album.  The chords, themes, and songs are borderline pop rock, but it's emotionally charged nonetheless.  I'd compare it to something like the first 2 Hinder albums.
B008JFUNTG|4.0|The lightning thief movie was a good movie unless you read the books then you would hate every scene. This movie is quite an improvement. The writers tried like hell to make it close to the book and they did. Granted, it isn't 100% like the book but then again, no book to movie is.<br /><br />Most changes are subtle and not noticed for most part. For example: In the book, they group went to the Sea of Monsters to get the fleece but also to rescue Grover who was taken by a cyclops. In the movie, only one of Grover's kind can lead heroes to the fleece. So, Grover goes with Percy, Annabeth and Tyson and he is then, kidnapped by Luke's men = Percy and company have to save him. A change but really, who cares? Point is, Grover is with the fleece and needs to be saved.<br /><br />Other small changes would include<br /><br />The trio taking the gray sisters's taxi from camp, not to camp like in the book.<br /><br />The trio going to Hermes at the UPS store unlike him coming to camp. (book)<br /><br />Hermes gives them the thermos and a tape dispenser. In the book, he gave them the thermos and a bottle of vitamens.<br /><br />Luke, Thalia, Annabeth and Grover are chased by two Cyclopses in the movie. in the book, the furies are listed as those that chase them among other monsters.<br /><br />The prophecy says a child of 20, in the book the age is 16.<br /><br />Tyson already knew his father when he go to camp in the movie. in the book, he did not know.<br /><br />Tyson and Percy are strangers in the movie but are friends in the book.<br /><br />If you can live with these changes, then you will be ok with the movie.case closed.<br /><br />The only slap to the face is the last 10 minutes of the movie. Spoiler.<br /> Kronos rises in the last 10 minutes of the movie and is sent back to his box by Percy, due to Kronos still being very weak. WTF! He rises and poof, he's safely back in the box. I wanted to scream and shout profanity at the writers.<br /><br />They claim to have done it so it would show impending doom to follow (aka, the next 3 books).They also added monsters early like the Manicore. fine. more action= more money. ok, I can live with that.<br /><br />All in all, I loved the movie. From the opening credits all the way to Kronos rising where I hated it. After that section of 10 minutes, when they get back to camp. the movie remains true to the book. Word for Word.<br /><br />I'm happy for how far they have come compared to the first movie. Just, dont expect it to mirror the book. No movie ever does unless the author wrote the script like The Hunger Games.
B00E193TM2|5.0|The modern music scene is more of a desolate wasteland in my opinion which is why I'm even buying music from this band to begin with.  The lyrics are not even worth listening to, but that's to be expected.  What truly surprised me was the improvement in song writing!  The songs are fantastic in the old 80s metal style.  Even if you only buy the album for the drums and guitar work it's well worth the money. There are some brutally awesome struts and grooves on this CD.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Every time I start to edit a photo, the app kicks me out, and I have to start all over again. Have not been able to finish one yet.....Good thing I didn't pay $4.99, and got as the free app of the day:-( If it worked correctly, would definitely be 5 stars.

B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Perfect for Sci-Fi enthusiasts. Cheesy plot line with a nice twist to mix it up. Easily worth a few bucks.

B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Jane Austen's cutting cynicism and tight penmanship is legendary - but this book has so much heart in it too. I love the combination of her writing style (sarcasm/wittiness) and the beauty of the story-line (100% romance) in this amazing book. Rather than make the romance appear weak, like you think it would, it makes it even stronger. Almost as if saying, love can overcome even the most cynical of persons.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Well written script  maybe a little over dramatic for tv purposes but excellent casting and they work well off of wach other  Loved it

I would reccomend this seller to any of my friends and I would definitely buy from them again. My one and only complaint would be the fact that I couldnt track my package, I guess it doesnt really matter since it only took two business days, but thats still a nice feature to include.

1451695195|4.0|Dr. Alexander steps through the facts of his case with the indifference that only a man of science could bring to this topic. His conclusion that there is life after death is both compelling and reassuring. For all those that are tormented with the current scientific assumption that we exist for a short time and then disipate into nothingness, this book will give them comfort that there is now scientific proof that the essence of man is immortal.

B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I have been a long time fan of this series ever since I played the demo.<br />This collection is perfect for those who have been only buying the games, without any packs.<br />It has all the games you need for the story line and then some.<br />Some of my games were too old to play without skipping plus I needed to bring out the old play station systems.<br />Now everything is conveniently packed into this collection and it's all HD and Snake Eater has very easy to use controls and camera views.<br />Note that you'll need wireless access to the internet to download some of the games.
0307913090|5.0|The sheer sense of accomplishment and awe of completing this book kinda overwhelms me but there's no doubt that this series is AWESOME! I'm not going to lie to you... A Game of Thrones is reeeeeeally long. There are a multitude of characters and several story lines all going on at the same time, so it's really hard to keep track of everything. But George R.R. Martin has delivered everything I needed out of a high fantasy novel --- war, politics, familial drama, dragons...<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the world-building because it's incredible. I don't think I've seen anything this imaginative since Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's hard to fathom just how much time and creativity and planning went into the construction of this world and series. If you're a stickler for detail, then this is the book for you! Wow. Words seriously can't even describe how beautifully and richly crafted this world truly is. But as great as the setting may be, the characters are what carry this book. They are all so wonderfully complex and multifaceted, so much so that it's sometimes hard to tell who to root for! And there are no knights in shining armour here despite what you might think. Every character is deeply flawed in some way, but it's those flaws that make them so human. The good guys make (often fatal) mistakes and I think that's why their stories resonate so much with us as readers. There is a deep connection to some of these people (i.e. - Ned Stark) so you really feel for them during their triumphs and during their tragedies.<br /><br />Also, Martin spares no expense, and by no expense, I mean nobody. Everybody is on the chopping block and he isn't afraid to kill off some of the series' most beloved characters. But I think that's yet another reason why this series is such a success. There's risk in reading/watching it. As readers/viewers, we're on the edge of our seats as we turn a page/watch an episode. We're all, like, sick masochists just waiting to see what sort of punishment Martin will dole out next. A Game of Thrones, if anything, is an experience (usually a nail-biting one).<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is told via several different characters and there are some people who won't enjoy that, but I'd say with so much going on, it was a necessary device. You get a deeper insight into the story this way and it's also interesting to see events through opposing perspectives. There were definitely some narrators that I preferred over others, namely, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. Funny enough, this also correlates to the characters I preferred in the show so that just goes to show you how well they play off one another. And yes, if you're wondering, the show totally does this book justice. You really don't need to read the first book to understand what's going on in the show, however, I recommend that you do anyway. It's too good not to. Also, because the story is so dense, the books help to make sense of the show (and vice versa). The novel clarified things that I was otherwise confused about as well as enriched my understanding of the characters and their motivations. I recommend grabbing the audio version if you can because Roy Dotrice is a champ! Fun fact: he even made the Guinness Book of World Records for doing the most amount of distinctive character voices in one audio production.<br /><br />So yeah, read it. Watch it. Live it. Love it.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Reading A Game of Thrones was quite the challenge, and consequently, finishing it was my biggest literary accomplishment this year. Martin has crafted such an intricate and wonderfully detailed  universe full of rich, complex characters and high drama. It has all the elements you could ever want in a high fantasy and rivals the LotR trilogy for best fantasy series EVER!see what sort of punishment Martin will dole out next. A Game of Thrones, if anything, is an experience (usually a nail-biting one).<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is told via several different characters and there are some people who won't enjoy that, but I'd say with so much going on, it was a necessary device. You get a deeper insight into the story this way and it's also interesting to see events through opposing perspectives. There were definitely some narrators that I preferred over others, namely, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. Funny enough, this also correlates to the characters I preferred in the show so that just goes to show you how well they play off one another. And yes, if you're wondering, the show totally does this book justice. You really don't need to read the first book to understand what's going on in the show, however, I recommend that you do anyway. It's too good not to. Also, because the story is so dense, the books help to make sense of the show (and vice versa). The novel clarified things that I was otherwise confused about as well as enriched my understanding of the characters and their motivations. I recommend grabbing the audio version if you can because Roy Dotrice is a champ! Fun fact: he even made the Guinness Book of World Records for doing the most amount of distinctive character voices in one audio production.<br /><br />So yeah, read it. Watch it. Live it. Love it.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Reading A Game of Thrones was quite the challenge, and consequently, finishing it was my biggest literary accomplishment this year. Martin has crafted such an intricate and wonderfully detailed  universe full of rich, complex characters and high drama. It has all the elements you could ever want in a high fantasy and rivals the LotR trilogy for best fantasy series EVER!
0307474259|5.0|This simple book backed up with qualified studies and science that &#34;low carb&#34; is the healthiest choice.I have lost 30 lbs in a little over 2 months, easily, and my blood pressure is normal.
B000E6EHGI|5.0|i lost this cd as well on a boat down the jersey shore.  thankfully amazon made it easy once again.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Such a great book! So glad I could have it at my fingertips at a matter of seconds because of Amazon!!!!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is a very nice photo app that will let you use your Kindle Fire HD camera more fully or edit photos on your original Fire.  I picked up the free version first and liked it well enough that I bought the paid version back in December 2012 for $2.50.  It's been upgraded considerably.<br /><br />Some of the reviews, not the current ones, say you can't save photos you've edited; I'm not sure if it's something they've fixed since a prior version, but you can--it is somewhat confusing though, it could look like you can only save to FB.  But there are two buttons, one that says Save with a right-pointing arrow, and one that says Facebook.  Clicking on the Save button saves to your device.<br /><br />When you first open it up, you'll see a black screen with a little picture icon in the lower left corner.  Tap on that and choose Camera, Gallery or Facebook.  If you choose Camera, you'll be able to take  a picture and edit that in the app.  Selecting FB just got me a spinner.  Gallery opened up the pictures on the device (make sure \\"Device\\" is selected at the top if you don't see the pics you want).<br /><br />If you pick Camera, and have other apps that use the camera, you'll be given the choice of Camera or the other app(s).  Note that when you pick Camera, you'll be given options to adjust the settings on your camera.  Tap on the woven looking icon surrounding the blue shutter button to adjust the white balance (AW), exposure (+/-), the scene mode (auto, action, night, sunset, party--I'm thinking this is shutter speed?) and a menu icon that lets you set the store location and the picture size--I recommend the defaults for these).<br /><br />Edit options include autofix, crop, straighten, brightness, color, blemishes, red eye, focal point, tilt & shift, fish eye, sharpness, and rotate.  There are filters, frames, and extras such as background fill, add an image layer, stickers, pointers, Attention (lets you place a shape around something), sketch, text, meme maker, colorize, speech (lets you add thought bubbles).<br /><br />All in all, quite a good app.  It also works on my Samsung Galaxy 2.rize, speech (lets you add thought bubbles).<br /><br />All in all, quite a good app.  It also works on my Samsung Galaxy 2.
B007EECSFA|5.0|So well written!  I was smitten from page one.  Well-developed characters, plot twists and turns that make sense (and don't seem contrived.) A really gripping story.
006178480X|5.0|As always James Rollins delivers all that i have come to expect from his books. It was a constant fight to put the book down.
B000005RUV|4.0|Bought this for a friend of mine that likes WHAM! Ended up getting 2 because I accidentally pressed it twice! Now we both get to enjoy it!
B007N579X6|5.0|3d was right on target this movie is funny and story line is well written easy to follow.laugh laugh awesome
B009G41CG2|3.0|I enjoy playing mahjong anytime. the only problem I have with this particular one is the background is too light.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|the rapids were so 3 d that my son bit is tongue while watching this movie every thing looked so real like  you were ther
B009DCOU9S|4.0|this is a pretty good hidden object game. I got it free as the free app of the day on my kindle fire. lots of extra puzzles throughout. I would probably have paid the $2.99 to get this game.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Historically accurate, mostly, of a life-changing event for many Americans.  It had me on the edge of my seat during many scenes of the movie.  Extremely real and believable and the acting was phenomenal.  I was also pleased to see there wasn't any gender bias; credit goes where credit belongs.  Obviously, lots of \\"research\\" was put into this movie.  I don't think any classified methods, procedures or tactics were compromised because, to me, everything was logical and sensible for what had to be done to get bin Laden.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|great watch love it about to get another one for my wifes uncle she loves it looking for something nice
B00000IMYA|5.0|Great CD.  Ellington's orchestra, of course, was great.  For the Newport Festival, way back then, they were terrific.  I could listen to Paul Gonzalves on the sax forever.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I am hooked on Downton Abbey, and have read several of Julian Fellowes' books.  This movie is an unintended preliminary to DA series.  I find the setting, the acting, and the costuming to be all together captivating, and am pleased to have this in my collection.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Nice app,  but it seems it is not able to save what you've done. So far,  useless. If they repair the saving feature, it has got great potential.
1616551607|5.0|U know liking a game/series so much that it becomes ur favourite game of all time. And than u find out that its art book is actually the freaking best work and compilation ever as well and for a price that makes u doubt the deal credibility? Well my body my mind cannot bear so much happiness.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Gaga's latest single sounds great. Perhaps a tad bit simple compared to her Born This Way singles, but it's still  super catchy and fun.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|This is not a movie as we think of a movie but actually a video of a musical done on a gorgeous stage in Melbourne Australia. I love Andrew Lloyd Webber and this was the only one that I never saw.  It was  a little different but it was quite good.  It  gave  a very surprising ending which  completed the Phantom.  I will watch this again.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|We got pretty much what we expected from this TV show.  It is creepy, fun, and involving.  It didn't exactly blow our minds, but it did hold our interest from beginning to end.  It definitely didn't suffer from my horror movie/TV show pet peeve of completely unraveling in the final act.  Definitely worth a viewing for fans of smart, well made horror.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I was online this morning because my stash of headphones had run out.  For years, I have typically bought them several at a time as their longevity is not the best. At 10$ or less a pair, I could do this.  I purchased these because ear buds are not comfortable and don't stay in place during my runs. Today, my jaw dropped when I saw one pair now costs $39.99. If these were of the same quality as the pair that came with my Sony Walkman back in the 80's, they would be well worth the price. While they are good for the relatively short time they function well, these headphones tend to have cutting out or loss of sound in at least one earpiece within weeks of opening them out of the package, even with good care.  I will have to scout out a replacement as $39.99 is outrageously expensive for a product that functions as \\"disposable.\\" I notice the one-star reviews are growing in number- unfortunately, I'll have to add mine to the bunch.
B000002J09|5.0|Great...That's all I can say.I missed buying this album all those years ago. Great tunes. Sounds are fantastic, and true to the heart.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I enjoy the show - I think the writers have done an excellent job of tying all the stories together.  Am anxiously awaiting Season 2 which should be released her in a day or two.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very exciting and I like it because you never get bored. There is always something to do. You can deliver people on buses and you can deliver other things like sugar etc. I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes making their own cities and if you like feeling in charge.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I had ready Max Brooks, Zombie Survival Guide long before I found this book, so I had some idea of the quirky rules he had set up.  That however, isn't where the book shined.  Instead the highlight of the book was the way he immersed the reader into the history by turning the narrative into a series of interviews with survivors of the zombie outbreak.<br /><br />It proves to be an excellent way to tell the story.  Here, the characters are allowed to fade into the background as the zombies and the threat they represent spreads out from a few locations until the world is engulfed.  Once you can see humanity on the brink, the narrative changes as human nature and stubbornness turns the tide and pushes the zombies back.<br /><br />it's a fun tale and an excellent one, that doesn't need any gimmicks like zombies who can run faster than a human to increase the fear.  The intensity is in the slow build.<br /><br />An excellent book for all to enjoy.
0786948523|5.0|This book has alot of information, that you'll need to get through your experiences. It was in great condition and arrived very quickly.
B00005A0RI|4.0|This is a fairly typical Charlie Haden CD, with some romantic and lovely songs. I recommend all of his CDs.
B008602KQI|1.0|I didn't read the books so I can't compare. However, this movie is really over hyped. The plot is predictable, the acting is below-average at best, and the story line just has too many flaws to even fix. Half the time, I predicted what's going to happen next and it happens. That's not a good piece of work when the viewers know what's going on in the movie, there's no fun and suspense in it. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie. Nonetheless, give it a try if you got nothing else to do.
B0000047EC|5.0|This is my favorite Charlie Haden CD, he and Pat Metheny together, the awards are all justified. Unqualifiedly recommended, I have given this CD to many friends, all of whom have loved it.
B004EPZ034|5.0|great show its funny and my kids get a good laugh at the show everytime we watch it together! sweet
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Have tried many options to save a pic.  Cannot find the pic using multiple File applications.  And, after experimenting with what location to save it to. Cannot locate on<br />Galaxy S3
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game was well done and very worth the download some people don't know this but ive spent 200 dollars on that game becuase its so good of a game.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I downloaded the FAOTD because I like messing with pictures. The app was great until I tried to save and then, like so many others, I found I couldn't. HOWEVER...I then went and paid on Google for the same app and everything worked perfectly. Not sure why, but this seems to be an Amazon issue and not a Picshop issue. I give the app 5 stars but have to give Amazon 1 star for this.
B009ZQNN90|5.0|I've seen the movie several times and recently saw the broadway version.. I recommend both!<br />It's a great movie.. With messages of self acceptance, societal sterotypes and perseverance..messages not lost in the times in which we live.. Enjoy
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Can never get enough of this. Just wish it was in 3 D. I love the original 3. Cannot believe it has been so long
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I didn't catch on to the Downton Abbey craze until it was into the third season, I watched each season in rapid succession - and LOVED it!
B004U7MR3C|5.0|I love a good romance and love to watch the dancing. Everyone in this movie, really play the parts well
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Although this album is a lot different than any of her other music, it is still good. I surprised my wife this year by taking her to Diana's concert of this CD's tour in Dallas for part of our 10 year wedding anniversary. GREAT concert! Will definitely try to go see her in concert again if she is anywhere close.
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|Although the story was lackluster. The characters were good. The scenery was beautiful. Just wish that Johnny Depp or Robert Downey were starring. Needed more character acting.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|This Songs Proves THat Lady Gaga Is Here To Stay.Every Time She Releases A New Song ,It Feels Like It Is An Improvement FRom The Last One.I was Shocked That I Liked It Because The Beginning Felt Like It was Going To Sound Like ONe OF Those Cheesy Eighties Songs That I Grew Up Hating.But Then She Sang THose First Two Lines And I Knew It Was Something Diffrent.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|This is my favorite of the series.  I am a big Kelsey Grammer fan and Stinky Pete was a good &#34;rotten toy&#34;.  I actually cried and loved the introduction of Jessie and Bullseye.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Simplistic in design and play, Journey adds a level of depth not seen in many games. I found it a relaxing way to end a day.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Toy Story is excellent and not just for kids.  I recommend all three movies for everyone.  The first is the start of a wonderful series.
0975991477|5.0|An excellent book for the non-scientist wanting to know more about the fundamental building block of the human body ... the cell.<br /><br />This is more than a history of the science and discoveries about the human cell.  It also offers an exciting introduction to the energy of the cell and new advances in medical care without drugs.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|love the Godfather. Learn about the love of family . The Godfather is on my top ten list of movies to watch.  The whole series is a beautiful work of art.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Good social media. Great way to stay more or better connected to family and friends that live a long distance from you.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Love Toy Story 3. It completes the series.  Get out your kleenex to all the parents out there....Growing up is necessary and not always easy to accept. Watch and enjoy and learn about letting go.
B00821OX98|5.0|I am just waiting for the next season. It gets better with each episode and I love the suspense and characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|.<br />Great game for everyone.I love it and so do my grandkids. Only wish they would make a PC version.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|... unless you are prepared to not stop...I played this game every night until 3 am...very addicting. Proceed with caution!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We LOVE this show! Thinking for Season 4 we will also view it as an instant video when it comes out--no ads, and can see episodes one after the other. Entertaining, non-violent, &#34;wholesome&#34; and we can't wait to see the next episode. We even enjoy seeing shows  for a second or third time.
B006HL9G10|1.0|Maybe I am expecting more out of this than I should but I didnt care for this app at all.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|Paid for it and have not yet played it, as I cannot access it...  :( I am told it should be there on my Kindle fire...but it is not :(
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|My husband and grandson loved it, I couldn't stay awake. So for me it was a no go but for the guys apparently it's a good flick.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Thanks for getting this movie out so soon. Already had it once and we watched it so many times that our copy became scratch so I had to have another one.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I really thought Matthew McConaugheys career was in the toilet, one bad flick after another but this movie proves he can act. Nice who done it, smartly acted and good script. I watched it twice.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Smash Season 1 was awesome! Can't wait to watch Season 2. I wish NBC would have picked it up for another season. It's an amazing series.
B004H0M8EA|1.0|Arrogant author.  Poorly written.  Rambles.  Very dry read.  Focuses more on author's high opinion of himself.  Total turn off.  Don't waste your time.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This app is great to pass the time with ;) I love emoji and its soo much fun to guess what the word is when its made with emoji.  Get this app :)
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read Ender's Game when I was younger and couldn't believe how much it spoke to me. Now that I'm older and the movie is coming I had been itching to read it again. I'm happy to say that I enjoyed it just as much today as I did the first time I picked it up.
B0026QC0TA|2.0|Life is too short for watching this movie; trust me you have better things to do with 2 hours of your life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its fun that its easy to play and a good starter tame is good for young people and children of all ages.
0307719774|5.0|This is a great little book, and I'll enjoy entering my thoughts in it.  I recommend others buying this book.
B004GYY714|5.0|I get to listen to whatever radio station I want on my kindle fire HD. And it's free. Love it.
B004ZGM76A|5.0|I love this movie, not really sure why- since its not exactly a happy ending. Great visuals and love that it contains more than 1 female, with a name. highly recommend.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This is a fast moving, suspenseful, light comedy. It has romance, action, humor and we found it quite entertaining! Makes one ready to face retirement with gusto!
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|This is one of the best movies that came out that year!!!!! Better than the book, the 3 characters- Charlie, Sam, & Patrick  are played beautifully by Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, & Ezra Miller. I enjoyed every minute of the film, and had to buy it since it is becoming one of my favorites. I highly recommend any one to watch this film.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|This isn't going to be one of your hot & steamy reads, but you won't feel cheated! From a guys point of view, this book will have you laughing out loud.  Drew Evans will become one of your favorites.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Love the songs: bittersweet, fire in the water, everything and nothing, speak up, and heart of stone. Those are my absolute favorites!!!!! Highly recommend if anyone loves a great sdtk.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I really loved this game. But when I wanted to unlock &quot;EVERYTHING&quot;<br />Only the glasses got unlocked. What??????????!!!!!  Uggghhh now I only<br />Have 4 coins left. But I don't want to waste my money for more coins. Get it but it is going to trick you. So I just give it one star.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Love the songs: hearing damage, possibility, I belong to you, rosyln, slow life, no sound but the wind, monsters, and done all wrong are my favorites!!!!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This app was one of the best youtube apps I've ever got!but it gives viruses sometime so that's why I give it 4 stars so I would say download it now
1449410243|5.0|this book is so cute, I am a veterinary technician- and I work with Cats only.... this book reflects exactly what I think cats are thinking. (jokingly) I highly recommend for anyone who loves cats and wants a good laugh. worth the money as a coffee table, bathroom book for guests!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was puzzling but that's what made it so fun there are some easy and some hard puzzles and sometimes I need my dads help to figure them out .i can't<br />wait for more levels because  I beast it in two days. That's why I have this awesome app FIVE STARS.
B00DU74U74|5.0|didn't think it would be very good considering it follows after the twilight saga which I loved. turned out to be v e'er y good currently reading the book!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is a smartly-written legal dramedy with a constant stream of great one-liners and verbal parrying, but also interesting characters, relationships and dilemmas. Very enjoyable.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|The app itself is fantastic, however, when you &quot;save&quot; it, the photo is not in the album, and is nowhere to be found, and it seems many people are having this issue. If that was fixed, then it would be 5 stars for sure.
B000WYCF6Q|5.0|I was in the process of &#34;inventing&#34; this when I finally found one already in production.<br /><br />Can move from bike to bike in a matter of seconds. Extremely easy to adjust.<br /><br />Easy for me to use visually as I could never get my eyes to focus on a helmet mounted mirror.<br /><br />I'd buy another in a heartbeat.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I've played a lot of this genre of game and this one was the best so far. It has a good story and a lot of areas to explore. The hidden picture are clear even when you zoom in. I just wish the price was a little lower. Barb and I play the game together all the time. We both enjoyed this one a lot.
B000LTAY1U|1.0|Date of purchase: May 23, 2013. Time of death: 2:31 p.m., August 12, 2013.<br /><br />I look at my watch in order to be filled with knowledge of what time it is. Instead, I am filled with disappointment.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|It works pretty well for me and I enjoy using it. It's not as slow as other reviews described, so I was happy about that. So, yeah I recommend this app.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Bruce Willis is a great actor for this character.  Loved the humor mixed in with the action. Highly recommend this movie.
1451648537|5.0|the delivery is fast. the book is much thicker than i image! the price is not expensive, and the quality is good! i like this stuff. and that is a happy shopping!
B0067R0APK|5.0|I like this app for it's quick and easy use!  Most of the time I can &quot;forecast&quot; the weather myself just by looking at the radar and seeing the motion.  One tap and there's the radar!  Love this app!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Lots of simultaneous plots, not predictable, interesting concepts of law as well as politics. Is our political system really based on misleading statements and back room deals without considering right and wrong.  Hopefully not
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I had fun figuring out each chapter of the game. Definitely made my brain think.  Some levels were easier then others .
B0086DBE62|1.0|Admittedly, I am not the target audience for movies like this, but I went along and saw it for free.  That was still more than it was worth--except perhaps as a keyhole view of some of the incoherence of our pop culture for kids of which we should be more aware.  (I live a blessedly sheltered existence most of the time--I don't own a TV anymore.)<br /><br />From an adult's point of view, the self-contradictory mish-mash of anti-male feminism (name a non-dwarf male character who wasn't made a gross laughing stock in the movie) and \\"romance\\" is hardly healthy.  Snow White goes from being an attractive, if classically artificial, peroxide blond with bushy black eyebrows to a raven-tressed would-be superwoman midway through the movie--but keeps her original eyebrows, which I suppose symbolically represented her incipient defiance of conventional gender roles around the castle.<br /><br />Later, after having her consciousness raised by the rather unappealing, politically-oppressed dwarves, symbolized by a makeover of her wardrobe and hair color, she locks up the prince who wants to rescue her when the dragon shows up--newly liberated woman that she is, she doesn't feel she needs a man to defend her.  But then she relies on a magic dagger instead.  Somehow this is a less than convincing display of her newfound self-reliance and skill in the martial arts. \\"I don't need a man, because somebody gave me magic\\" seems a bit lame to me--even in a fairy tale.<br /><br />She is, however, truly self-reliant verbally--she is slyly diplomatic in public about the dwarves (obscuring their real, far less appealing character), in contrast to her cynical view of the utility of a full-grown male prince as anything but arm-candy at weddings.  In that she is perhaps not so different than her wicked stepmother.<br /><br />Meanwhile for the intended audience, children, all the flamboyantly exaggerated special effects really aren't needed.  Small kids are over-stimulated or simply bored by them.  My 6-year old son was soon running around and playing catch with a girl his age at the back of the lawn where most of the crowd sat watching the movie.  Spell-bound, no doubt.<br /><br />I guess I'm clearly a grumpy old man out of step with the times, but I prefer some tasteful subtlety in children's stories, not this visual and political bombast.  And if we must have a political message, perhaps the solidly plausible feminism of, say, Wellesley's Stone Center would be more persuasive than Hollywood/Bollywood's garbled propaganda.<br /><br />Personally, I'd far prefer a Rocky and Bullwinkle feature-film version of Snow White to this.  They, at least, had a sense of humor and wry self-awareness when they irreverently delivered cliches with a novel twist.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Really find the animation helpful in solving these puzzles. Having the numbers disappear from the list is really helpful!!! Thanks for a great game!!!
B006FE83UE|5.0|Ok, I grew up in Louisiana but never with the prejudices of my father and brothers so this movie really speaks to me of trying to set an example for one's children and community.  Doing the right thing because I think this character, Atticus Finch was impelled to do this.  He could not do otherwise than represent a man who would not get a fair trial.  I had forgotten what happened to the man he represented.  See it, see it.  It is a classic.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Not as good as Spartacus but not as graphic for both sex and violence.  I recommend if you are tired of the usual violent series without the good acting, plot and scenery.  Season 1 was better than this one but you will still enjoy it.
B007XF4J66|5.0|Wonderful photography; great acting - ok some of the lines are over the top but all in all a truly great movie.  Bergman is  gorgeous and Bogart is Bogart as usual.  Such a great ending, yes?  The German deserved to be shot, well, you know, his character did.  And the line about a great friendship is classic.  So if you haven't see, see it - in black and white.  And don't leave when they begin to sing La Marseillaise.  I still get teary.  See it but all means.
B00BQ1DATU|5.0|Fave song: Suddenly.  What's unusual for me is that I like almost all the songs on the CD. A pleasant new sound.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I wish there was more about her husband and the end is getting more interesting.<br /><br />Mother-in-law is still annoying..<br /><br />Oh wel
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have loved these books for the beginning, i borrowed them the first time I read them now I have purchased then to read them again :)
B007PJFIU6|4.0|I got this game to play with the family on our beach trip.  My daughter 10 really enjoyed it.  This game takes some creativity, so I think you have to play it with the right type of people.  It took us all a few rounds to start to get the strategy and some folks never really enjoyed it as much as other.  I think this is a game that the more people involved, the better.
B002IVLH6U|5.0|This album is the epitome of grunge grown up. It truly rocks. I would highly recommend this any Pearl Jam fan new or old.
1401235425|3.0|As much as I enjoyed the concept behind the Court of Owls, the New 52 has had a devastating impact on the Batman family of books. The compressed history now makes no sense and takes away the grand build up that Morrison's 7-year run on the title lead to. Moreover, Snyder, while he's a fine writer, is no Morrison when it comes to delivering the force of character of the Darknight Detective. Batman seems to go through the motions here, whereas Morrison gave more of a sense that Batman was always under control of (or at least anticipated) the events and circumstances in which he found himself.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|My daughter got this book as a gift and raved about it, making me want to read it also. I really like re-tellings of fairy tales, so I was looking forward to reading it and I wasn't disappointed. It was surprisingly unusual, even though the Cinderella elements--Prince Charming, bad step-mother, 2 step-sisters, a ball--were all present. I didn't think Prince Charming's character was developed quite enough for a reader to really care about him, but since this book is one of 4 (I believe), we should have other chances to get to know King Kai. In any case, it was a lot of fun to read. P.S.: the next book, Scarlett, is even better.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs was such an amazing man.  Someone once said he was a very complicated man; until I read this book, I had no idea how complicated he really was.  Although I was really shocked at how he treated people, at the same time I had such respect for him.  He thought of every little detail when it came to the Apple products!  And even in the hospital, being treated for cancer, he had ideas on how to make the hospital equipment better.  Just cracked me up!  How sad that he is no longer with us.  Because of this book, I am even more aware of how much he changed our world.  He gave us so much before he left us.  Sometimes I go back and re-read sections and smile.  I bought the hard cover but it was too heavy to carry back and forth on the bus to work, so I ended up ordering it for my Kindle also.  That way, I can refer to it at any time and have bookmarked my favorite parts.  One of my favorite books!
B001NLKZUA|3.0|Engaging characters, an exciting plot, a romantic triangle....what's not to like? If you're a teenager and if you're not already tired of the many versions of this type of story, that is. There are so many fresh, delightful, and truly imaginative books out there--it's funny how fiction is just as trendy as clothes and hairstyles. This book was trendy and entertaining. Be aware that teenagers have adult-like sexual relationships in this series--and in this book our hero and heroine consider incest--and adults are either absent or don't quite understand--typical fare of teenage fiction.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|useful beautiful. app. it could be easier to tag the music you want for an alarm haiku's karate chop wow
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|After purchasing and testing the Chromecast, I've decided to get rid of it, because of its limited use. Chromecast only works on YouTube, Google Music and Netflix on Android apps or on Google Chrome. My conclusion is: don't support proprietary hardware that is limited in its capabilities. Us consumers need to force vendors to use standard systems (like USB, HDMI & Bluetooth). When Apple, Google, Samsung and all the big players create their own proprietary hardware that benefits those who use their hardware devices, it allows these companies to take advantage of us consumers only if we fall into their trap.<br /><br />If you want to play a game or project any other app (other than the 4 mentioned above), including the Photo Gallery to present a slideshow, then Chromecast will not work for you! What a major let down!<br /><br />Why Chromecast when you can Miracast?<br /><br />Miracast is a standard like bluetooth that wirelessly transmits hiDef audio and video between two devices.<br /><br />Miracast is a way of transmitting HDMI-grade audio and video over a direct peer-to-peer Wi-Fi network with another Miracast-capable device. Chromecast is more like a network media player you control via web browser or mobile app like Plex or XBMC where your mobile device acts like a remote control rather than originating playback device.<br /><br />Miracast was created by the Wi-Fi Alliance ([...] and billed as an open alternative to Apple's AirPlay Mirroring.<br />It's a standard (device agnostic) like bluetooth, USB & HDMI.<br /><br />Soon, everything (input and output) will be miracast enabled: vehicle screens, tv's, computer monitors, projectors, video cameras, etc. So you'll have a video camera sending a wireless signal to a projector and an audio system. And you'll have your phone act as the GPS unit in your vehicles miracast enabled screen.<br /><br />I hope this helped.<br /><br />Cheers!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I got this for my daughter to use with her iPad.  She uses many art apps and the multiple tips are perfect for whatever she is doing.  She went through several cheaper ones before.  This one is very durable and so far shows no sign of wear.  I will get one for myself, too.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I really liked this book. Very detailed and honest. Held my interest the whole time. I had a hard time putting it down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It only took four days to read all three books but I'm finally done and can move on with my life.
B005HED08I|4.0|I am a Star Trek fan so I like this series. Not sure what more to say about it then that.
B005ZI306S|5.0|\\"Cross Your Fingers\\" is a short but sweet Kindle kid's book that is recommended for parents looking to excite their children about reading. I love having Peter Collier's books in my Kindle to read to my daughter now that she is starting to get curious about books. Recommended.
B00992CF6W|1.0|ever since the update things have gone downhill I cant do regular multiplayer and they are going to charge me for realms. what happened  to real minecraft?
B008JFUREC|5.0|I love This Movie & The 1st one. Despite of the bad reviewss it's very enjoyable. One the best. My review is 7.8 yea it deserves that.
B005544TRQ|4.0|If you like the law and/or lawyer shows then you'll love Suits. The premise is original and all of the witty banter is great.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Probably I read this influenced by the gossip abiut the movie and the fact that is a real story... I don´t know... I can´t say that I don´t like it but I can´t also say that I like it a lot...<br /><br />It´s a good story but probably needs more action.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Fun game, passes the time. Gets a little old after awhile. Then I do another game. I like other games more.
B008220D7S|2.0|I'm surprised this got some good reviews, I thought it was a bomb. It has some laughs but is actually kind of depressing. The best thing about the DVD is that Graham Parker and The Rumour plays live in the movie and then does a half dozen live songs on the Extras. Good band from the 80's, have the type of sound made famous by Elvis Costello and Joe Jackson.
B003TH5L7S|5.0|I really enjoy the fashion and flair, and the drama on Desperate Housewives.  It is wonderful to be able to watch it at my leisure.  I'd recommend this to any DH fan.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I was really loving this game until I found a glitch on level 7 that causes you to see the boat when you tap on the desk lock. The game freezes at that point. Too bad because I was having fun. :(
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This was free but I would have paid for it. I love this Mahjong. Totally worth the download. Different backdrops and so many different combinations. Can play for a long time. Perfect game for waiting at Doctors office.
0316226130|5.0|the book has more information than the movie so that was a plus.  I'm planning to collect all the parts to this title and movies too.
1616550414|5.0|This book has everything a devoted Zelda fan would love to have. It has concept art from nearly every game. The concept art is very detail with Skyward Sword. The chronicle line is fluent, and it even has pictures of very rare Zelda merchandise. Fans of The Legend of Zelda, get this book! =D
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the storyline and characters. As a good drama should, Downton's got me excited, sad, frustrated, and laughing in almost every episode!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|It's a Seiko, it fits my style, price was right, it is casual looking, goes with any occasion, outdoorsie (if that's a word)
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I've installed twice and a reboot.  Still cannot open a photo or even the camera.  Glad I didn't pay a penny for it.
B004LROMQG|5.0|You cannot go wrong with this.  Merlin is one of the best series ever.  It is in excellent shape and it shipped very quickly.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is an awesome dongle.  It works very well, it was easy to install.  I especially like that you don't have to install anything on mobile devices, the correct apps just do it.<br /><br />Only feedback for improvement would be to allow chrome tab casting on mobile devices and to speed up the performance while chrome tab casting.<br /><br />I absolutely love that it doesn't stream from your device, but rather from the cloud.<br /><br />If your app doesn't chromecast, it should.  For $35 I'm giving these out at christmas.
B0083Z614S|4.0|A wonderful book! Great for any young reader! Will definetaly share this with our other children when they are ready
B00DCX08MW|4.0|It's a great game and for only the one purchase of a dollar unlocks everything it's worth getting if you like plane simulators or WWII things<br />and I find for best control of plane turn on controls to full and simulation off.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Too wordy and too much detail. I got lost ! I was looking for another epic like Pillers of the Earth, In my opinion this fell short !
B008CLI4N4|5.0|The episodes were so exciting even tho I knew what was going to happen (I've read the books).  I watched the whole first season in one weekend and ordered the second.  It was wonderful to see actual people fill in the characters in the book.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This show is fantastic and really well written. Just when you think you know where things are going, it takes and unexpected turn and you just HAVE TO watch the next episode to see what happens next! And then the next episode and the next...
B007D2XSW0|1.0|App either isn't saving the pictures after you tweak them, or the gallery isn't picking up the modified picture and allowing you to access it. So it's useless if you can't access the picture you worked on. Failure.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I have read all of Ellen's books.  They are wonderful.  If you don't laugh out loud while reading them I feel sorry for you because there is something wrong with you!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved the book the most out of the three. I wish that there were more books written by the author before he died.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this serial! I wish the season 4 was free too on prime! I would never pay $1.99 for one episode, and I am not cheap but does feel expensive!
B009WUBERW|1.0|Absolutely ridiculous. I couldn't believe they want to make a 3rd movie in which Bruce Willis wants one million dollars per day. I guess they are trying to usurp Disney's Lone Ranger for the worst movie of the year.
B00CLD671A|5.0|So much happen in this season. One unexpected surprise after another. Can't wait until season 4 starts and new characters are introduced.
B00BU9DXAY|3.0|The book is cute, I'm glad I bought it on sale. It was funny, but just not as good as I had expected it to be.
B003B02OOG|4.0|I. Enjoyed most of the stories but some of the endings were disappointing, Maybe disappointing Isn't he correct word maybe strange but I always enjoy reading Grisham
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This kind of movie is right up my alley! If you like awesome singing and good humor then you'll love this!
B003O86FMW|5.0|There is no way to describe how much thought went into this sequel. The story line gets much deeper and makes you wonder how the author even thought of it. Such a great read keeps you turning the pages!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's fun for my sister and I so it's great for us.We play it mostly every day we so much fun we just love this game who made this app I say thank you for making this game thanks.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Really like this app...much better than Instagram, very intuitive, cool filters and other features.  But, like other reviewers, I cannot seem to save my edited photos.  I can either post to Facebook directly or hit \\"Save\\", and then select the image quality (Low, Medium, High, etc.)...at that point, however, it seems to process my save request but nothing happens and I have no idea where the image is on my phone.  Help!
B002VKE1K2|5.0|Paranormal Activity is a movie that moves slow at times, but is still suspenseful. Keeps you on edge, right up to the end.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Although I still love having physical cards, this provides a challenge to help play better.  All around good fun. May buy full game sometime.
B00AW57L96|5.0|The Husband's Secret is, in fact, a novel full of secrets - not just a husband's. And isn't that what all our lives are made of? Do we ever really share what we truly think or feel? And, as the author asks us, if we are married do we become more or less honest and transparent?<br />I have been married for a very long time; but this novel made me think more deeply about my own reactions and relationships than any other novel. It made me question my marriage, my \\"definition\\" of love, how well I really know my husband and my children ... and I am better for it.<br />This is a novel that \\"shows\\" rather than \\"tells\\". It is beautifully woven and cleverly constructed. If there is a weakness, it might just be the epilogue which I felt was unnecessary; but I loved the novel and highly recommend it.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|A combination of 2 styles of games I love to play, matching and dungeon crawling, wonderfully done with the retro feel to it.  Haven't finished it yet, but I'm sure I will play again and again.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Hard to find truly original stories out there, but Oblivion is refreshing in a summer full of sequels!  LOVED IT!
1616550414|5.0|The book starts off with a section only about the Skyward Sword, but it is fairly important because the book has a timeline that places the skyward sword as the first in the Legend of Zelda timeline. It has concept art and notes from the artists and designers. And in the back it has an original manga about the beginning of the LOZ universe. It goes into fairly great detail about very game. Even if you only like one Legend of Zelda game you will enjoy this book.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great variety of sounds!!  Classic white noise with some truly beautiful sounds.  The endless possibilities in making your own mixes is awesome!  Will definitely recommend!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I've been trying to find an alarm like this for a while. I choose the songs I want to wake up to.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is an awkward book to rate.  There is a lot of good and different.  There is also a lot of vague and unfinished agendas.  I read constantly.  It is my favorite activity.  There were times during the reading that I couldn't wait to see what was happening and other times when I was just annoyed by the characters.  I think the idea behind the story is fantastic.  It is a really unique concept.  I think it could have been much better if the characters were equal to the story.  They needed to be stronger and the story needed a more finished ending.  It left a lot to be desired and left me feeling disappointed with the book.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Definitely worth watching. I was skeptical when I first saw trailers, but the movie has a compelling story and deals with some pretty dark stuff.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This ending had a twist I wasn't expecting. Great read from Nicholas Sparks. It was a nice change from his typical endings
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Enjoyable game. Reminds me a lot of one of my favorite PS2 games. Ace combat 4. Will continue playing. Good way to take up time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book started out with me thinking it was another cheesy high school romance novel. I was so wrong! It was so good and had some crazy twist and turns
B001JIFYSA|4.0|Silly and too predictable but a fun light entertainment for a lazy evening.  Very type cast.  No more to sat.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|The story of Miriam who was raised in a small kolba, built by  her father, Jalil, and his 2 sons, for his illigitimate daughter and her derranged mother.  At a very early age, Miriam ran away to her father's house miles away only to be rejected by her father and his wives and subsequently given in marriage to a much older man and moving with him to hundreds of miles from home.  A story of courage,determination, hardships and love of family,  - very touching and moving.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I had to read this book for school and just expected it to be another book but I actually really did like it.it has a very good message. I enjoyed this book very much
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Funny. Cute. Really this is a fun movie to watch. Great lines. &#34;Why do you call yourself Fat Amy?&#34;; &#34;So skinny bitches like you don't call me that behind my back.&#34;

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I don't write reviews - but this movie was surprisingly good. Good enough for me to take 2 minutes to write this review ;)
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Like a book you really get into the character from what I have heard. As this was a gift! A gift.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was good to awaken the mind after doing the daily routine for several hours.  Need more rooms and puzzles.
0345803493|5.0|Do you ever read a book that fascinates you so much that you wish you were in the book itself? I would love to do that so that I could be in the time period, and meet the people in person!
B009UZBLSG|1.0|Does not work unless you bend the wire in an exact position and hold it there. Returning, I'll see what happens with the second one.

1400069807|5.0|This book does a good job of unveiling the thought process that goes into making snack foods for consumers. It is a harsh and cold reality but I feel everyone should read this book. It is informative and entertaining.
0425263924|5.0|Do you ever read a book and it intrigues you and makes you wish you lived in that time period, era or household? Well this one does!!! It makes you wish you could meet them!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Gary Taubes is all over this issue. This is a great piece of work, occasionally sluggish in the first half, but very rewarding overall. Also good to find someone writing in a lucid, scientific style without seeming pedantic.<br />A Must Read.
0345529057|5.0|Do you ever read a book and it intrigues you and makes you wish you lived in that time period, era or household? Well this one does!!! It makes you wish you could meet them. This was for my BFF.
B003VTZTU8|5.0|It is always a good thing to challenge the accepted social norms and Ben Goldacre does that with a background of knowledge and good common sense. It is well written and entertaining and informative without creating psdeudo science hysteria.<br /><br />Nicole Levy
B000J3OTSM|5.0|The dancing and music are awesome!!! Let alone Channing Tatum!!! I love watching this movie. Over and over again.<br />wahoo.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|fun but don't really enjoy waiting or the fact that I have to &quot;buy&quot; more lives or crystals. will not spend real money to play.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Who doesnt like a good movie with a good looking actor.? The women do! So watch away it definitely does not hurt the<br />eyes.

B00932A4XE|5.0|This movie is very cute, My lady and I have watched this movie several times. It is a feel good movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The English know how to write and play a great drama. Although the season finale was way too drastic. Too much to be truth. Im sure the writers/producers will make it up on Season 4th.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|I am pretty sure you already read enough about the series and I read some comments that George Lucas changed a few things and a lot of people are upset with that. Well...it was HIS creation, HE has intellectual property over it and for that I am thankful because I had a blast over so many years with this Saga. For me it still looks as a movie from last week. George Lucas was so far ahead time that it is amazing.<br />But, i tried to safe a few bucks and bought this used. Boy oh boy...this seller and I have a completely different perception about what good condition is. I would't really mind, if the price was right, but they tried to sell a product in awful condition for top price.<br />The box was tore, dirty and less than acceptable. If they had priced it right I really wouldn't mind but this one went right back.<br />It sucks...some seller just don't get it.
159562015X|5.0|The results of my test were surprisingly enlightening. It took characteristics that I downplayed as negatives and revealed how they were actual strengths that could be utilized to advance my career, my relationships, every aspect of my life.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Excellent music!<br />Had to watch all of season 1 and 2<br />Sad its been canceled because I found myself wanting more!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Dont think about it, just read it.  Once you read the last page, you'll be glad you did, and then you'll find yourself ordering the next in the series.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I had never heard of this author but I decided to give it a try from the reviews.  Enjoyed this book very much and loved reading it on my tablet.  I use the Kindle app on my Samsung 10.1 and couldnt be happier with the presentation.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE it  it is so much better than angry birds  you don't just get 3 sharks like in angry birds
B007D2XSW0|5.0|There have been a lot of reviews rating this app very low because it will not save your photos anywhere you can find them, but that was not true for me. When you press the save option, it even says &quot;Your photo can be found on your camera roll.&quot; After a minute or so to let my kindle catch up, I checked the folder in my photos titled &quot;camera&quot; and there was the photo!<br />I'm not sure what the problem is other people seem to be having, or if the developer finally fixed the problem, but it works great now!<br />Since it's free today, I suggest downloading it and doing a test photo to see if it works for you.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|A game my daughter can play that isn't violent!  She loves to play with the ponies and the games the ponies play.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|This movie is thrilling, breathtaking, and awesome!!!!!!!! I don't care what the critics say!!!! The visual effects, the stunts, are thrilling to high heaven. The scene when the three of them are riding in the tunnel is the best scene of all; it's captivating, you feel like you are in the car with them feeling frightened to high heaven from those infinitely scary natives and most of all holding on to dear life!!!!!! All it needs is the rolling rock from Raiders of the Lost Ark to top it off, but otherwise its mezmorizing!!!!!A cinema masterpiece. Temple of Doom is epic in adventure, I love the darkness and halarity and pride that this movie gives to its audience. This movie is brilliantly stunning, it truly captures the essence of Indiana Jones. One of the best movies you'll ever see in your whole life!!!!!!5 stars for me, heck, 100 stars if I can give it!!!!!!!!!!  Two thumbs up for me, way up!!!!!!
B000E6ESL2|5.0|I love this movie. The acting is great, its visually interesting & the film score is one of my favorites.<br />And it doesnt hurt that Ryan Gosling is smoking hot.
B000BIQKXM|4.0|I really like the song 'When you say you love me&#34; on this with Diana Ross -- great song!  Some of the other songs I'm no as happy with buy over all like this album.

B00CHRBA12|5.0|Over time you forget the minute details of why The Allman Brothers were so dam good.<br /><br />Listening to these tracks exposes you to a barrage of musical and lyrical genius.<br /><br />The Allman Brothers created music that is every bit as relevant, powerful and beautifully performed as the first day I first heard it.<br /><br />Totally Awesome!!!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Got this game not knowing about it and turns out to be very fun and addicting a must have game<br />My 3 yr old loves it
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is a hilarious comedy about a cappella groups on a college campus. It centers around a girl named Beca who gets involved with an all-girl a cappella group in order to please her dad. The casting in the movie was fantastic, and the humor was even better. Seriously, the more times you watch this movie, the more jokes you'll catch that you didn't notice before. It's one of those movies you can watch again and again.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's a great mini puzzle game with levels for every user. It's fun. But watch out, it's addictive. Yep. That's it.
0307279189|5.0|This is a must-read for all runners or people interested in starting to run. The quality was excellent and shipped when it said it would.

B004XVN1T4|4.0|Ken Follett, known primarily as a British intelligence thriller writer, is equally skilled as a an historical fiction writer, The combination of his historical research and knowledge with his undeniable talent for story telling is a treat for any reader.
B007X3DQGM|5.0|The diagrams are excellent and help with the written text.  Beautiful photos!  I am very much looking forward to working my through this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It does not get any better than this series.  It does it all...acting, writing, costuming, school  meet.  A great  series  .
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Because of this story, I have greater empathy for the many female prisoners currently incarcerated.  Further, I believe that so many people suffer this great indignity because they have they have little to no viable alternatives readily available. This story also discussed the hardships endured by the loved ones of the inmates. So often, when we think of people serving time in prison we do not stop to realize the extreme difficulties placed upon the entire family.  I appreciated that the weaknesses and ineptitude of the entire prison staff from correction officers right to the CEO's were portrayed.  Because the entire population is held within the prison generally against their own will, the staff is given excessive power and, sadly, is poorly equipped to serve to the best interests of the recipients.  I think that if the staff were better trained and emotionally more stable, it may be possible that there would be far less recidivism from the inmates.<br /><br />Piper was in an entirely different social status than the majority of other inmates and, fortunately for her, realized that her most important task was to get along with her peers.  She was well aware that her background was entirely different from the others and handled the unexpected situation with great skill.  She was able to secure excellent legal assistance and, most importantly, her boyfriend, Larry, remained faithful to her even though it was, at times trying for him.  An important message in the story showed us the clear advantages of being more financially able to hire quality legal counsel as well being better educated.<br /><br />I am looking forward to many more seasons of this series.  Helen

B0051GOB26|5.0|Before I commence with the awarding of Bowling for Movies score on The Big Lebowski, I thought I would share a bird's eye view of the process.  If you've read any of our other movie reviews you'll know we use an elaborate method, utilizing modern technology and a special blend of both quasi aaaaand pseudo-science.  While I can't confirm that this \\"secret formula\\" for rendering movies into a comprehensive bowling score resides in a safety deposit box in a major New York bank - I can share with you that I hit the googlemachine (you know, it runs on the innerwebs, it's pretty technical) for reviews, comments, and critic's opinions.  I spend hours contemplating not just my opinion, but Mrs. Lady Movie-Dude's, and Little Miss Movie-Dude's (where appropriate).  It's an intensive process designed to check and recheck every aspect of the review process so that you, faithful Amazon review reader, get the most genuine, the most accurate, the most dependable movie review possible.  We here in the Thomason house know that reviewer/review reader's opinion won't always see eye to eye but the hope is you will see the time and love we lavish on the reviews.<br /><br />To date, no movie has \\"bowled\\" a perfect game.  A down side to the process is we watch movies and then discuss what went wrong - it can interfere with the post movie glow.  Critical analysis is, well, critical and being critical by its very nature, negative.  It forces you to take off the rose-colored glasses and see things for what they really are.  We feel this walking on the darker side of cinema is worth it in the end because of the insight it brings.  What movie could stand up to that sort of microscopic scrutiny?  Well, frankly - none - until now:<br /><br />The Big Lebowski Bowling for Movies Score... 300 of 300!!!  A perfect score!!!<br /><br />Long Story Short:<br />Aging hippie, who lives for bowling, becomes intertwined in a ransom plot gone wrong due to an identity mix up - ...\\"let me explain something to you, uh, I am not Mr. Lebowski - YOU, are Mr. Lebowski.  I'm The Dude...\\"  One strange episodic adventure leads to the next and a million dollars goes missing, a gun is pulled on the lanes, and a cowboy known simply as The Stanger gets a decent soft-drink.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, and John Turturro star in a Cohen brother's masterfully written and directed script which was nearly universally ignored by audiences (hey, 90's cinema was pretty easy to ignore).  This movie has mystery, comedy, irony, it's total fiction yet comes off as 100% authentic.  The characters are richly painted and serve as perfect archetypes living in an equally realistic microcosm inhabited by stoners, Vietnam vets, surfer dudes, pronographers, and hyper-militant feminists.  I originally picked this flick up off the Blockbuster shelf back in the day (which was a Thursday) purely because \\"Hey, that's the dude from Tron\\" (we're from California originally, by way of explaining the many dude's in my native tough).  What followed was a far out journey into the far reaches of The Dude's world.  From a reviewer's point of view this movie is perfectly acted, perfectly scripted, perfectly scored.  The Cohen brothers threw out The Real Deal and not just a \\"ringer\\" full of dirty underwear.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />- Bridges' portrayal as the laziest person in Los Angeles County - he transforms into the most laid-back zen hippie dude and evolved into a very un-dude stress monger as the events unfold... and back to his personal center seamlessly<br />- If the script is the heart of the movie, the soundtrack is the soul providing the perfect emotional backdrop throughout - from CCR to Kenny Rogers, Bob Dylan to Captain Beefheart; I hate the Eagles but Hotel California in Spanish was simply perfect for Jesus to make his appearance<br />- The comedy is unforced but flows naturally and organically as these strong personalities collide as the plot's arching mystery bring strangers together under strange circumstances.<br />- The dream sequences... dude, need to been seen to believed<br /><br />Who would NOT enjoy this film in my humble opinion:<br />- People who are allergic to laughing - could cause a serious rash<br />- People who are overtly uptight - you know who you are (you probably marked it 1 star)<br />- People who think America peaked in the 1950s<br />- Rush Limbaugh (what else needs to be said)<br /><br />Hey, have any question about this movie review??  Drop a comment and I will try to respond as quickly as possible.  Bowling for Movies was in no way shape or form compensated for the review.

B001E1B6NE|5.0|good movie! Always can make me laugh! You do not even have to watch it in the winter too be good! Gotta love will Ferrell.!
B0000085N4|5.0|but it was a great time while it lasted.  I nearly drove off the road the first time I heard The Cult on the radio back in the 80s and this album rocks (clean and simple).  Well worth a couple of bucks to relive the glory days :]
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I was quite disappointed at how the book ended it felt somewhat unsatisfactory. It's an ok book to read but not a series I'd follow....
B0054R6BFM|5.0|A wonderful reminder of how it really is the little things that count on the plus and negative side of life
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is awesome and offering it for Prime customers is a great deal! It is almost &#34;Psych&#34; meets &#34;Franklin and Bash&#34;.
B004WR125O|3.0|I think this product works pretty well for the price.  It doesn't get a very good signal compared to other WiFi devices in the same location but it gets the job done.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Went through this season in a weekend because I couldn't stop watching. Great twists and story lines for this season. Can't wait for season 8 to come out on dvd!
B00B8BR6CU|5.0|Way a wonderful way to spend a few hours.  Joseph Fiennes is delightful as the playwright with a wonderful and strong cast as well.  Don't miss it.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|I did not enjoy using this at all.  I don't have any more words to use to describe this product.
B008133MDK|5.0|This modern rendition of Sherlock captures his genius perfectly; the characters are each fitted to their roles. I recommend it.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|It is very entertaining.  I like the sounds, how it looks and it is just fun as well as relaxing.
0425263924|5.0|Firstly I'd like to thank the publishers for sending me this book to read and give an honest review.  I absolutely love this series and after an exciting ending to book two I couldn't wait to start this one.<br /><br />The story picked up where book two had left off - Eva was reeling from what she had discovered and I was keen to see how it would affect her relationship with Gideon.  Throughout this series their relationship has kept me gripped to the pages, there have been times when I was rooting for them to work things out and times when I have felt that they should just call it a day!  They both had very traumatic pasts and this was something that brought them together, as did the sizzling sexual connection they shared, but outside influences seemed to keep getting in the way.<br /><br />I found all the characters to be likeable (even the bad guys) and once again I loved Eva's feisty attitude, she was certainly a good match for the sexy and powerful Gideon who was complicated in so many ways.  Magdalene surprised me this time, she was very different and I found myself much more interested in her character.  Brett was a favourite of mine and I want more from him (fingers crossed for the next book), I have a lot of questions where he is concerned so I'm hoping he will feature more heavily in future.<br /><br />There were a couple of very unexpected events which kept me guessing and as I finished the last page I felt kind of lost because I had really enjoyed my time with these characters and I knew I would have to wait to find out more.  I can't really pick a favourite of the three books so far, I have enjoyed them all equally and hope that pattern continues.<br /><br />As with most books of this genre the Crossfire Series has been compared to the Fifty Shades Series, my personal opinion on this is that the Crossfire Series is miles better - I enjoyed this storyline and writing style far more.  I also found the characters more appealing and generally easier to like.<br /><br />Warning:  Entwined With You contained strong language and sexual scenes so if you are likely to be offended by this then it probably isn't a book for you.<br /><br />This was another gripping read in a fantastic series, I would definitely recommend it..<br /><br />Warning:  Entwined With You contained strong language and sexual scenes so if you are likely to be offended by this then it probably isn't a book for you.<br /><br />This was another gripping read in a fantastic series, I would definitely recommend it.
