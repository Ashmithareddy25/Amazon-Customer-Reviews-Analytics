0783225733|4.0|I don't think it matters whether you remember the story of the Apollo 13 space mission or not.  Whether you know the ending or whether you were otherwise occupied at the time in 1970, the tension created and maintained by the fine script (by William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert with uncredited help from John Sayles) and the direction of Ron Howard will compel your interest.  And when the resolution comes it will command your emotions.<br /><br />Part of the success of this movie goes to the fine acting by Tom Hanks, who is, in a professional and psychological sense, very much like those fly boys with the Right Stuff who fearlessly left our comfort cocoon here on earth and ventured into the cold, dark airlessness of space for glory and honor and maybe for proof of their manhood.  Like the astronauts depicted, Tom Hanks is always on task and always delivers an arresting and believable performance.<br /><br />Ed Harris, who played the flight director in Houston was also excellent as was Kevin Bacon as the replacement astronaut who had to fly the ship.  In fact the entire cast, especially a whole lot of people with small roles as part of the nearly anonymous support techno nerds at NASA, gave believable and compelling performances.  A lot of the credit for that has to go to Ron Howard, who made sure that they all looked the way they were suppose to look.  After all, they were engaged in the success or failure of the mission in the most immediate sense.<br /><br />I also was very much moved by the musical score by James Horner.  When you have an extraterrestrial epic, you need the music of the spheres, and Horner provided that.  The music was so triumphantly married to the events and to the cosmic adventure, that it inspired without drawing undue attention to itself.  It is one of the most beautiful film scores I have ever heard.<br /><br />Although this was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it won only two, for Best Film Editing and Best Sound.  Perhaps the movie was considered too much of a purely commercial venture at the time (and because of the budget it was largely that of course), and perhaps Howard's direction and intention seemed very much by the book.  However I think the final result turned out to be more than some thought when it was released in 1995.  It is a heroic epic, with a worthy theme, professionally done.  Everybody worked hard for veracity and they certainly convinced me.  Nonetheless there is perhaps something missing here.  Although the sheer horror of dying in the cold vacuum of space or being burned up by a too rapid descent into the atmosphere is kept very much on our minds, there is a level of psychological reality that lives within the heart and soul of the astronaut and within the astronaut's family that was attempted here but not entirely achieved.<br /><br />See this for Ron Howard who did a great job as director and for Tom Hanks, one of the most charismatic actors of our time, and especially for astronaut Jim Lovell who lived it and (with help from Jeffrey Kluger) wrote the book Lost Moon (1994) upon which the film was based.ound.

B000002TQV|5.0|After the success of their debut album \\"Pablo Honey,\\" Radiohead returned in 1995 with the highly-anticipated \\"The Bends.\\" Now personally, I was not a very big fan of their debut album. It had a few high points but the rest was just boring and flat. I truly believe that if it wasn't for their sophomore album, Radiohead could quite easily have slipped off into obscurity to join a long line of other bands who were so 'promising.' However, that didn't happen because the world caught onto The Bends and rightly hailed it as one of the best albums of the 1990's. I don't consider this Radiohead's best album. Nor do I consider it a monumental masterpiece. It is a fantastic rock album though, and definitely amongst one of the best records I own in my 200+ collection.<br /><br />The album opens with the brilliant \\"Planet Telex.\\" The sonic soundscapes of this song's introduction are very memorable, and set the scene for the rest of the song. Thom's vocals are very distinctive on this song and I enjoy the chorus a lot. The album's title track, \\"The Bends,\\" is the next song and is one of my favourites on the whole album. A lot of people don't really like this song but I bloody love it. It gets off to a rocking start and has a very anthemic chorus, but my favourite part of the song is the part where Thom sings, \\"I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy, I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen!\\" The next song is \\"High And Dry\\" and is a bit slower and more melancholy than its predecessors. The sunlight vocals of the chorus are very effective and the guitar in the chorus is great too - very similar to something Oasis were doing at the same time. \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" is a fan favourite and is even slower than the mid-tempo track before it. I find the chorus very emotional and raw considering its 'fake' lyrical content - which is, I suppose, is what the song is aiming for.<br /><br />\\"Bones\\" returns to the all-out rocking that dominated the opening of the album, with brash guitars and electrifying choruses, littered with eccentric vocals. It's not one of the best songs on the album, but it's still a great addition. \\"(Nice Dream)\\" is a very beautiful and deep rock ballad. I find this a great song as I listen to it because it just connects to you, but once you stop listening to the album and try to think of the melody of the song, I guarantee you won't remember. Very strange. \\"Just\\" is one of the album highlights and one of Radiohead's best ever songs. There's something about this song which makes it very unique and special yet on first-listen it sounds just very run-of-the-mill. The jittery guitars in the chorus that climb higher and higher make it a masterpiece in its own right.<br /><br />\\"My Iron Lung\\" is another one of my favourite songs on the album. It has that instantly recognisable opening which runs again through the choruses that just twists and snakes its way around the lyrics. The way those lyrics are arranged is also very catchy and the song breaks out into a really heavy rocker near the second minute. \\"Bulletproof..I Wish I Was\\" is a gloomy yet oh-so-gorgeous ballad with some great soundscapes which create a beautifully atmospheric backdrop to Thom's dark vocals. \\"Black Star\\" is another one of my favourite songs from the album, yet again, because of the way the lyrics in the verses are arranged. It is so bloody catchy and I love how the song opens by becoming louder. It's as if we're arriving mid-song and we've missed something at the start. \\"Sulk\\" has a superb opening that sounds like something vibrating and bouncing off your speakers. The song itself has a great beat to it but I'm not too fond of the chorus. And then of course, there's the album closer, which is widely-hailed as one of Radiohead's finest-ever songs: \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out).\\" The music on this song is beautiful and melancholy, Thom's vocals juxtaposing this with fear and depression. I love the way he goes from a hushed note to a loud yelp within the space of \\"Fade out again.\\" An absolutely beautiful song to close such a brilliant rock album.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />\\"The Bends\\" isn't my favourite Radiohead album. That title belongs to \\"OK Computer,\\" and even \\"Kid A,\\" in my opinion, is better than this second album. I'm a man of musical complexity - the weirder it is, the more I'll usually like it. It's a challenge to appreciate the music on OK Computer and Kid A, and I do appreciate it, after many listens, which is why I love them so much. I really took to \\"The Bends\\" quite easily so it was almost instantaneous that I loved it. Some people may not take to this album as well as I did, but out of all their six studio albums, I'd recommend this as the first one you listen to.p within the space of \\"Fade out again.\\" An absolutely beautiful song to close such a brilliant rock album. <br /> <br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"The Bends\\" isn't my favourite Radiohead album.

B0006399FS|1.0|<br />They've lost it. No imagination, no new ideas, just recycling older material. Same lyrical treatment, same production skills. Some of their '90s albums even sound more modern. This proves two things: 1) They've run out of creativity, 2) They're just in it for the money now. Sad.  <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />I can't believe this is the same band that made those masterpieces back in the day. they really really REALLY need to give it up. It is unveliebable how Bono can say with a straight face that this is the U2 he has liked best and that they are at the top of their game again. At the top of a crap pile maybe. But even when you are at the top of a big pile of crap, the overview lets you see on top of what you are standing (Crap that is). <br /> <br />
6303022901|1.0|I truly had high hopes for this film as the book received such good reviews.  Unfortunately the film version was a sad disappointment.  As a working screenwriter I'm shocked this film ever got made -- first of all, if I wanted the book read to me I would have purchased the book on tape.  A film is expressed primarily through visual images, then dialogue, NOT through narrative extracted from a novel.  The story is hard to follow and the film ends up being a succession of vignettes which do not flow and cause a choppy, unintelligible result.  It was long, slow, draggy and I kept finding myself checking the clock to see when it would finally end.  Oh, in parts the acting is so melodramatic it's hard to stomach. <br /> <br />As for the content....I am a Caucasian Christian woman who was offended by the sterotypes presented of Chinese people.  Having grown up in San Francisco I am fairly well acquainted with this culture and I don't recall ever having had the impression of Chinese men as they are presented in this film.  While watching this film it came to mind that there definitely seem to be personal psychological issues which came through as a catharsis for the writers/filmmakers.  When one makes a movie about a particular culture great care needs to be taken -- there is enough racism in this society, films certainly do not need to spread more.  I regret having to rate this film one star, but in my opinion I can't give it a higher rating.
0141439661|5.0|The book tells about the remarkable family of Dashwood whose family home was located in Sussex.  The book is about two sisters who are as diametrically opposite as two can be.  Marianne is the younger sister, and she is eager, imprudent and excitable.  Elinor is much more sensible than her young sister, and her voice is always the voice of reason.  But it's the world that Ms. Austen always brings to her pages that is so captivating.  She more than many others can create a little piece of  the world that the reader has the privilege of discovering and then learns to love, just like Ms. Austen's characters do.  This is what puts Ms Austen's books so much above the norm in this particular genre.
B00005MP58|1.0|Let this be very clear: the ONE star is in very specific reference to the DVD Special Edition being a \\"DOWNGRADE\\" (as another reviewer called it) from the original VHS version.  The picture and audio are not super terrible, it is just that it was a lot better on the VHS!  Why did they mess it up like this?!  The program itself is fantastic and I highly recommend it.  My wife and I watch the whole series at least once or twice a year (not in one sitting, mind you!).  For details on exactly what is wrong, please see the review from \\"A viewer (Sandpoint, ID USA).\\"  I completely agree with them and would only add that darks and shadows tend to be completely black and devoid of any light and detail whatsoever. <br />
0316172324|3.0|I thought The Tipping Point was a great book. Entertaining, enlightening and relevant.<br /><br />My pitch on this one: \\"We intuitively 'know' in our gut what's right or accurate 'at first blink'. And more often than not, that reaction is accurate more than 50% of the time. The more we 'think' about something or get emotionally involved, the less accurate our 're-thinking' it is. Professionals who have lots of experience in a particular area of expertise develop an ability to process very complex concepts or situations unconsciously and are right more often than wrong.\\"<br /><br />Malcolm goes on to cite plenty of entertaining examples around art forgery (pros who spot a fake but can't tell you why it is), marriage consultants (who predict with over 90% accuracy whether a couple will be together), gamblers (who change their betting behavior before they consciously know what's wrong), a tennis critic (who could predict a fault before the ball hit the racket) and plenty of others that are interesting.<br /><br />After reading a couple chapters, my wife said, \\"I call it a woman's intuition\\"...no big deal.<br /><br />I can't say that's all there is to the story, but there's some truth in the comment.<br /><br />The bottom line: it's a fun, fast read and it's good for some entertaining conversation with friends and business associates.<br /><br />The good<br /><br />- Very Entertaining<br /><br />- Well-written<br /><br />- Malcolm is a great story-teller (or has an awesome editor or both)<br /><br />- The stories are relevant and interesting<br /><br />- He boils some complex ideas down into easy to understand stories<br /><br />- As a consultant, it's an easy book to recommend to others<br /><br />- Very good conversation material<br /><br />The not-so-good<br /><br />- It's not a \\"how to\\" nor do I feel that there significant distinctions or lessons that can be applied to your real or business life - adjust your expectations now<br /><br />- It's \\"kinda mushy\\" - I'd categorize this a \\"Pulpy Pop Business Book\\"<br /><br />- Not as revealing or useful in a business environment as \\"The Tipping Point\\"<br /><br />My \\"Blink\\":<br /><br />- I'm betting he got a multi-million dollar advance on this book<br /><br />- If you like Dan Brown's books (The Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons), you'll like this.

B00005JNJ7|5.0|This brilliant movie starts out on an inspiring note, with the destruction of the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre (Voila and Adieu). And then it just gets funnier and better. The puppets appear quite human so that there's no problem with the \\"suspension of disbelief.\\" The heroes are quite fallible but very likable.<br /><br />There's some spectacular cinematography in the Panama Canal scenes and in Egypt, where the Great Pyramid and the venerable Sphinx suffer the same fate as the Eiffel and the Louvre. The Mount Rushmore scenes, (HQ of Team America) are also impressive.<br /><br />Gary is an actor appearing in a Broadway musical when the Team approaches him for help. One of the most gripping scenes is Gary singing lead in a rendition of the hit song Everyone Has AIDS. The camera catches the emotional audience as some individuals shed an elegant, politically appropriate tear or two. Priceless!<br /><br />Things turn even more hilarious with the appearance of the Film Actors Guild (FAG), led by the silver-tongued Alec Baldwin. His speech, interrupted by rapturous desk-thumping by the assembled FAG-ers that include Susan Sarandon, Sean Penn, Jeanine Garofalo and a particularly DUH Matt Damon, is something to cherish. The media comments by some of these esteemed celebrities are equally hilarious.<br /><br />Then there is of course the intercourse, a passionate scene between two attractive teamsters, giving new meaning to Leonard Cohen's album title Various Positions. This is just a short interlude; I didn't find it particularly shock- or noteworthy. People do get up to these types of trick in the grip of passion.<br /><br />Kim Jong Il is definitely a star of the movie with his cute accent and his banally evil personality. I caught myself entertaining thoughts of sympathy for Kim as he fed Hans Blix to his pet sharks. And the feeding itself reminded one again of the awesome savage power of nature. \\"Brix\\" (as Kim called him) learnt a lesson for trying to impose his Euroweenie nuancy boy stuff on the dear leader of North Korea. What arrogance to attempt such a thing!<br /><br />In the meantime, the porcine propagandist, also known as Michael Moore, has caused great damage at the Mount Rushmore HQ by blowing himself up with a suicide jacket. But when things look bleak, Gary returns as the hero. Kim is entertaining the FAG celebrities plus delegations of dignitaries from around the world. This is to distract them while his minions are preparing to set off 230 major bombs around the world.<br /><br />Just in time Gary frees the team, then he uses all his skills as an actor and orator to deliver an eloquent speech that completely upstages Alec Baldwin, the master of ceremonies. The detonation of the bombs is averted and a fight to the death ensues between the Team and the Hollywood actors. A particularly sleazy looking Sean Penn meets his end at the fangs of a big black kitty cat, Sarandon is sliced in two and the others are shot in riveting gun battles.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I sorely missed Parker and Stone's most lovable characters, the Canadian master comedians Terrance and Phillip, whose movie Asses Of Fire contributed so much to making the South Park Movie so unforgettable. A bit of Terrance and Phillip's flatulence and coprofilia would have made this little gem even funnier.<br /><br />Easily bored, I don't like long movies. I am pleased to report that Team America: World Police is just the right length. No scenes are superfluous or too lengthy, and the action sequences are all in the right places. I think it is going to become a cult movie like The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The best songs are the aforementioned Broadway number and Kim's I'm So Ronery ...<br /><br />Team America: World Police has a progressive and subversive message that ought to please everybody across the political spectrum, from the leftist moonbat to the conservative fruitcake and all people with a sense of humour inbetween. The Gnostic nature ofGary's speech with which he wins over the audience of worldwide dignitaries, is particularly striking. Underneath all the vulgar references to reproductive and other organs, there is a profound message to people who like to ponder these things.<br /><br />I also strongly recommend Stone and Parker's South Park TV series, the movie South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut and the CD Chef Aid. This talented duo's genius and wicked sense of humour are quite unmatched in popular culture today.s particularly striking.

B0006399FS|1.0|U2 are no more than an overhyped product within a brand. to think this has been a cash grab by the 4 men who make up the band and their manager is laughable.     so many have their hands in the pot on this i would think the voice of the band would be drowned.  much anger stems from fans contrasting present day monolithic, corporatized U2 with the band that waved the white flag.    consider that the corporate entertainment landscape is vastly different than it was when U2 formed their image. U2, the supposed band of integrity and protest, recently decided to screw over independent record retailers, by signing an exclusive contract with the Best Buy, the 1,900-store consumer electronics and appliance monolith. According to the terms of the agreement, Best Buy would have a two-week exclusive to sell a brand new U2 live DVD for $18 and also get the rights to sell an out-of-print U2 Greatest Hits Album. In exchange Best Buy will help to promote a broadcast of the concert on DirectTV's Freeview Event series for paying customers and spend up to $10 million promoting U2 through transit bus and newspaper advertising.     Bono has a big mouth and U2 are completely sellouts.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Absolution is one of the best cd I've ever seen. All songs are good on it. They play different kinds of music and they know how to make them sound good (i should say perfect). At the first listening of the whole cd, i was like ``hmmm, it's good``, but as you listen it, as you like it. According to me, the singer is really a genius: he plays guitar like crazy, he sings like crazy and he plays piano like crazy (he did a solo in a song and I was really amazed)!!! The bass player plays really well also. I highly recommend this cd to everyone, especially those that like Radiohead. To conclude, this cd is extremely diversified and will certainly please everybody.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Pop has always and probably will always be my fave.    I will defend it until the day I die. I hope that we will get the chance to see U2 put themselves out there again. Every song on this record is a stunner. And each has its own sound, that's amazing and unusual as well.     Do you want to know what Originality means ? listen to this. Enduring, outstanding, flawless.  Do not listen to the sellout U2 2000, listen to this instead !!!.    When U2 had creativity and hungry passion. Simply their finest hour.
B000002JK4|4.0|All of the Robert plant albums are gems. Unlike people like Michael Schenker and others who, after leaving their previous successful bands surrounded themselves with lesser talent, Robert Plant hired great progressive minded, talented musicians. Where as many of the others failed to create anything noteworthy, Robert Plant, in my opinion created the best progressive rock of the entire 1980's. almost every track on every album is artistic and musical and either rocks or mystifies or takes you on a musical journey somewhere. Beginning with this album, if you like it, you'll probably like all the others equally.

B0006213H6|5.0|This is a re-release of Sigur Ros's debut Icelandic album, now in the US for the first time.  It's far more atmospheric than the recent releases, with long passages of screaming, merging with angelic, tonally strange choral music, back into silence and disconcerting sound.  The album is quite evocative--and conjures imagery more effectively than ( ), which almost becomes a rock opera by comparison.  Particularly in the earlier tracks, the music seems to have been produced in a massive, wide-open space, far out in darkness, on a freezing night.  It's chilling, and quite interesting.  This isn't an album I would recommend for the car, necessarily; but it's an extremely powerful soundscape, and a great key to understanding one of the more innovative bands out there.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|With each disc running over with information and enthusiasm you will definitely get your money's worth out of this set. If you are a fan you can't miss this. The transfers are terrific and the commentaries are balanced and mostly good. The philosphers and the critics are funny and try to bring something to the proceedings.  <br /> <br />Anyone that longs to see how things are constructed won't be disappointed. It can really help you appreciate the movies more when you see what work and creativity went into it. Overall the set is like the trilogy itself, multi layered and has something for everyone.
B0000399WI|5.0|Judging by the volume of reviews for \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" there probably isn't much more to say other than that this is a great landmark film.  I'm going to use this forum to sing the praises of Morgan Freeman because this film is his greatest accomplishment in an impressive film career.  As good as the ensemble of actors employed here Freeman's Red is the glue that holds the whole enterprise together.  This performance is the difference between a very good film and a great one.  I remember when Siskel and Ebert were doing their Oscar show back in 1995, I can't remember which, but one selected Freeman as best actor and the other picked Tom Hanks for \\"Forrest Gump\\" the logic being that Freeman had the less showy but no less powerful role while Hanks performed more mannerly.  As time goes on, Freeman's role eclipses Hanks but that's not how the Academy saw it at the time.  This year Freeman is nominated for the Oscar again for his role in \\"Million Dollar Baby\\".  I hope he gets it.  I watched the Golden Globes and it broke my heart to see Clive Owen beat Freeman for his part in \\"Closer\\".  Owen was very good but when you take the track record into account Freeman is long overdue for the gold statuette.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|this is exactly how i want the world to end. it's funny and filled with irony and zombies  - sure they're out to kill you and eat your brains but you're sure to have fun in the mean time. all due diligence is paid to those movies that came before laying the groundwork with reference and allusion that will appeal to any movie buff. this movie could have succeeded on even a minimal budget, but instead it had enough to make the zombies as good as anything you'd expect from hollywood - that is, if hollywood had the good sense to dump all its gold into zombie films. <br />Thank you so much for this film.
B00064MW6A|2.0|What can you say about this flick that hasn't already been said.  The film that launched a thousand bad puns.  I tried to ignore the Razzie people's seven nominations for this film but they seem to have gotten it right.  Halle Berry should fire her agent.  The Academy is asking her for it's Oscar back.  Where to begin?  Bad direction.  Never trust a director with a one name monicker(i.e. McG of \\"Charlie's Angels:Full Throttle\\" fame).  Pitof seems to have gotten his start in making bad music videos and translated it to the big screen.  Bad script.  The writers of this drivel have never met a cat joke it couldn't resist.  My personal fave is when Halle is revived from the dead by the cats it looks like she's coughing up a hairball.  Bad acting.  Halle looks ridiculous playing the frump at the beginning and doesn't have a clue as to how to play Catwoman.  The best part of her performance is when she sports the leather catsuits.  The gymnastics are impressive but it's obvious that they were done by stuntdoubles and computer graphics.  Sharon Stone is not entering middle-age gracefully.  She comes off more shrill than villainous.  Only Benjamin Bratt as Halle's cop boyfriend escapes this fiasco with any dignity.  I would give this film one star but I don't truly hate it.  I had fun picking apart the film's faults.  Besides, with the purchase of this DVD I can get two free issues of \\"Suede\\" magazine with the option to subscribe.
B0006OBPTA|4.0|The first 3 in the set are what every fan of the 80's genre of movies should have in their collection.  They are entertaining and exude that form that the 80's is so famously known for.  Elizabeth Shue is in the first one. The fourth is an entertaining addition to the first 3 done in the 80's.  I would reccommend this set to anyone who loves the karate movies of the 80's such as Bloodsport, which is also another great.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|Lately many DVDs, especially those targeting youngsters, force you to watch a series of movie previews before you gain control of your DVD player. This is one of those DVDs. DVDs did not use to include previews, or if they did, they were either an option from the main menu, or you could skip them and jump to the main menu.  <br /> <br />However, this DVD will not let you skip the previews - every time you put the disk in the DVD player you are forced to watch previews of other moviews for what seems like an eternity before you can access the main menu. I paid a lot of money for the DVD and I do not want forced-upon-you commercials against my will.  <br /> <br />DVDs that have forced-upon-you movie previews should indicate so on the cover so I can have the option to not buy them! Most stores (including Amazon) will not let you return DVDs that have been opened, so when you discover that these DVDs have forced-upon-you previews, you are stuck with your purchase and cannot return them. I give this DVD one star because of this braindead feature.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I was only two when this show came out and loved it!!  When I was little I couldn't wait for it to come on....I don't remember a lot of it which is why Im dying to get it on DVD!  I remember when i was like 3 and 4 years old happily yelling....\\"Gyver, Gyver, I want Gyver!!\\"  For a little girl that young...well lets just say it wasn't normal.  I just liked the theme music and the fact that my parents watched it i guess.  I remember watching reruns later also..i loved when he'd fix a bomb or something w/gum wrappers or everyday objects.  I can't wait to watch this season on DVD to help me remember my childhood.  Although everyone has stated that there are no extras and the quality is poor....i want it simply because its MacGyver.  Yes they should want to treat the show with the respect it deserves, but I am just happy they are even releasing it.
B000002C1W|4.0|There are very few cds that I own today that I grew up on during my adolescent years. One of those cds is Pink Floyd's post-Roger Waters album \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\". Back in my awkward teenage years, I worshipped the ground my older brother walked on. I thought he had the coolest taste in music (before I discovered punk music in my latter years in high school). My brother would play a lot of Pink Floyd's music. One of the cds he listened to a lot and exposed me to was \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\". I had never heard such an amazing sound. This album may not be \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" or \\"The Wall\\" but it certainly left quite an impact on me that the other albums didn't have in some subconscious way. The songs on \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" that really stood out with me was the anthemic \\"Learning to Fly\\" and the epic \\"On the Turning Away\\". The songs were incredibly catchy. My only problem with \\"On the Turning Away\\" is the ridiculously long guitar solo but the same can be said about most of Pink Floyd's music, the pompous, self-indulgent guitar solos. Otherwise, I love \\"On the Turning Away\\". It is one of the most moving songs that I had ever heard in my life and it still is to this very day. The poignant lyrics and the haunting melodies is what I love most about the song. Don't get me wrong I do think Dave Gilmour is a great guitarist but I sometimes I just don't care for guitar solos that just goes on and on like his does. The lyrics tends to be pompous and self-righteous but at the same time they certainly don't sound dated, especially in this current day and age (especially the song \\"Dogs of War\\"). \\"Signs of Life\\" is a beautiful opener for this album. I thought it was a good way to set off the tone for the rest of the album. I thought that Dave Gilmour did a really good job as the lead vocalist on all of the songs. \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" may not be \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" but it certainly has a place in my heart as one of my favorite albums from my childhood.albums from my childhood.
0805047905|5.0|I first borrowed this book from the library.  My then 18 month old loved it so much, I bought it.  He learned his colors through this book.  Easy rhyme is fun for both children and adults.  He's now almost 3 year old and this is still one of his favorite book.  He memorized the entire book. He loves to pretend reading the book as I point to each word.  Now my 18 month old wants the book, and I am thinking of getting another one.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|This film is not about convincing and flawless special effects that we have seen in \\"Titanic\\" or \\"Matrix.\\" It does not have the monumental narriative of  \\"Citizen Kane\\" or \\"Gone With the Wind\\". This film however, is no less than a masterpiece of the art of film making. For all those who loved the Republic Pictures serials of the 30s and 40s,  for those who are amazed at the beauty of \\"art deco\\", and those who are fascinated with the propaganda art, seen in World War 2 and used by both the Allies and Axis powers.... this movie brings it all together. <br /> <br />It has brought the future, as it COULD have been envisioned around 1939 at the dawn of the war, to life. It is filmed as though it were a well-crafted comic book. Film noir lighting costumes, sets and lighting intact. Even more incredible in this day of MTV style quick cuts and modern \\"street language\\", the dialog is appropriate to the period. No profanity, overt sexual overtones, or disgusting blood soaked scenes (although the visuals are truly dazzling!), this film is powerful in how it looks, grand in it's scope and intensely entertaining with no weak spots, tons of action and every scene a work of art. This film is pure entertainment from the beginning to the end and left me wanting more. <br /> <br />This is a movie I hope we get many more of. It is perfectly suited to a sequel and perhaps a series of films. Yeah, it easily gets my 5 stars... absolutely!
B00005QEO2|4.0|Particularly if you don't have any of their other albums, or if you have giant gaps in your mid-years Aerosmith collection, this is a great anthology. It includes a lot of odds, ends, and B-sides from their other albums, plus the greats, like Elevator, Ragdoll, Dude Looks Like a Lady, and the Run DMC Walk this Way. There's also a four song live segment, and while the live Dream On and Fallin' in Love are fabulous tracks, I think the live Sweet Emotion is weaker than the studio. Because this is a one-label anthology, it's missing most of the comeback hits (Pink, Don't Wanna Miss a Thing, Jaded, etc.) which is a real disappointment. Still, a great listen and well worth the money.
6305252521|5.0|I'll always remember the first time I saw \\"The Truman Show.\\"  Besides my astonishment that Jim Carrey could actually act seriously (and brilliantly, at that), I was so riveted by this film's tragic beauty that I recall sitting on the edge of my couch, frozen in the same position during the entire last hour.  Years later, I regret that I can never watch \\"The Truman Show\\" for the first time again, but I can appreciate seeing new details every time I view it. <br /> <br />The key quote of this film, I think, comes from Christof: \\"We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.\\"  Just think--just stop.  Think about that.  Just for a second (though preferably longer--it's not easy to wrap your head around).  It hearkens back to the oldest philosophical questions known to man: why is there anything at all, and why are we here?  Jim Carrey allows us to look through the eyes of someone whom we fear we are, when we stop to think in those dark moments of life. <br /> <br />Everything about the end of this film is hope.  Sure, sometimes we feel now as Truman did when his boat finally reaches the end of the stage.  We beat, pound, and rage against that which keeps us from reality.  Like Truman, we struggle to the point of exhaustion and finally turn our backs, slide down the boundary, and try to reconcile ourselves to this shadow of life.  But, like Truman, I think someday we'll too be given the chance to step through the door in the wall.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|My mouth was agape, not as I watched this movie, but as I read all the reviews of people who praised it. I am astonished. Although, thankfully, there were a few reviewers who think as I do: the first movie was awsome, and the next two totally sucked. It's that simple. This trilogy wins first place, in my humble opinion, for the largest discrepancy in quality between the original film and its sequels. I will always love the first film, and try to forget the fact that the next two even exist. Some sequels (e.g., Aliens, Terminator II, The Two Towers)have actually managed to out-do the original. I would have been happy if the last two Matrix movies were half as good as the first. Two thumbs way down.
1594200106|3.0|I labored through this huge book and don't feel rewarded for doing so. What was this book trying to say with so many pages? Couldn't it have been done with 100-200 fewer pages? It was well written though dark and depressing. The only thing that kept me from giving it 2 stars was a nice little twist that I did not see coming. I won't spoil it for you if you decide to embark on this marathon of reading.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Considering how good the original was I assumed that the sequel would be nearly as good. Of course I knew it wouldn't be exactly on par with the first, but it would at least be entertaining. It was not. Some fight sequences were exciting, I admit, but for the most part is seemed as though it was slowly dying. The plot was trite, the characters wooden, and this forced sexuality and romantic drivel was really annoying. I didn't like any of the new actors (Mrs. Will Smith? Please! I can't decide whether I should laugh or vomit first) and thought the orgy/dance scene in Zion was ridiculous. It was as if they were trying to recreate an MTV video where everyone was wearing earthy-toned clothes. Everything was so contrived and BORING. The only really spectacular scene was when Keanu Reeves was fighting off the thousands of attacking agent clones. The first half was full of pointless sentimentality that left me with an aftertaste which didn't disappear as the action scenes increased. All in all, if you saw \\"The Matrix\\" and loved it, then don't watch \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\" because you'll be sorely disappointed.
B00006JIA4|4.0|Queen was without a doubt the most commercially successful rock band to come out of the UK in the 1970s and has secured its place was one of the most internationally recognized and popular groups in history. However, as with the catalogues of most great bands, their greatest hit sets never do them justice, no exceptions here. This three disc Queen set is the most definitive introduction any casual Queen fan can find on the market short of delving into their actual albums, and, despite its blemishes, is the best introductory collection anyone can get. I do have some qualms however which need explanation. <br /> <br />Disc 1 has by far the most listenable material of the collection. On this one you'll find all of Queen's hit 70s staples--the cuts most casual fans will recognize. The only song that shouldn't be on here is \\"Flash\\", Queen's first experiment with movie soundtracks. It's a good song and unique in that it includes dialogue from Director Dino De Laurentiis' 1980 film \\"Flash Gordon, but its quality pales in comparison to the rest of the material on this disc. The only reason it made its way on here was that it was a Top 10 single in the UK. Since there was an ample 20 minutes of unused disc space, it would've been nice if moderate 70s hits such as \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" or \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" were included. <br /> <br />Disc  2 Is also excellent, but the music isn't nearly as listenable, especially hearing it for the first time, but a few more runs and the cuts will grow on you. Not much more to say here. <br /> <br />Disc 3 is where the compilation bogs down. The first track, \\"The Show Must Go On\\", a live version performed with Elton John, is a horrible opener. The succeeding track, the Rah Mix of \\"Under Pressure\\", isn't so hot either. Most of the other songs, at least the ones recorded originally by Queen are moderately good, if a little too much on the soft rock side. The live version of \\"Somebody To Love\\" performed by George Michael is nearly as good asthe original. \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" with Wyclef Jean shouldn't have been included. I don't have anything against rap, but the song is not necessary at all and isn't very good listening. A nice replacement would've been Stone Cold Crazy. \\"Barcelona\\" and \\"Las Palabras De Amor\\" are examples of songs aimed at Queen's South American and Spanish fans. Both are excellent songs and add to the dynamic and colorful nature of this disc. <br /> <br />Despite its faults, if you don't own any of Queen's material and are interested in purchasing a more or less comprehensive anthology of the band's work, this is the set to get.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is the first movie in the trilogy, and the best. The Matrix has many fight scenes and mysteries thrown in. It is a movie about an unreal world that certain people can enter and when jacked-in the matrix, appear much more powerful. Through all the action and a hint of love story, this is an awesome movie that will take everyone that watches it into its grip.
B00005YW4H|5.0|There are thousands of reviews for this CD, so I won't go on for long... <br /> This CD is a masterpiece...there's not much else to say about it.. When I heard the first single for the first time and saw the video I was not impressed--thought she was rather boring...but now I've grown to love Norah. <br /> <br /> This CD has so many greats, I won't go into each one. EVERY song on this CD is unique and timeless. It's amazing that a jazzy type artist like Norah can be one of the biggest selling artists of today..she brings hope to the music business..I love her...so sexy, and so so talented.
B000002G23|5.0|Buying this box set should be automatic for anyone who grew up in the 70's or 80's. There's very few songs on this album that would get a 2 star rating or lower. Few as in I can count on 1 hand.<br /><br />The Police have so many huge hits, such as Roxanne, Walking On The Moon, Message In A Bottle, etc. Also, many of the other tracks are classics, such as The Bed's Too Big Without You, Bring On The Night, Invisible Sun, etc. You cannot do without having this set. 4 CD's and you have EVERYTHING The Police did. Including b-sides and songs from other sources (such as I Burn For You from the Brimstone & Treacle soundtrack)<br /><br />Bottom line is this. If you like any of The Police big songs, it's very likely that you will also like all of their other songs. Why not get them all in one bang instead of getting the 4 individual albums and having to deal with trying to find all of the other B-Sides? It's totally worth it.
B0002XVQNU|3.0|I like Daredevil comics and the original movie, and I felt Ben Affleck was fine in the role. I wanted to register though that I preferred the first version of DD over this director's cut. I really appreciate M.S. Johnson's dedication to this character and working so hard to make this movie true to my favorite comics hero, and after watching the interview on this version, I can see and appreciate what he wants to do. After watching it though, I believe the original cuts amounted to a better movie. For example, MSJ mentions wanting the violent extra scene of the Kingpin killing his own bodyguards to really illustrate how bad he is, but you already know and subtlety is relative, especially in comic book movies, but for me that scene was gratuitous, or at least unnecessary. And the courtroom storyline was okay, but again, to me it didn't improve the movie and I found Coolio's acting, well, not good. To me the first version is tighter storytelling and it's the one that I prefer.  <br /> <br />If you already have and enjoy the original, I recommend renting this one first to make sure that you prefer it. I assumed that I'd like the director's cut better and was going to sell my other second-hand, but I ended up selling this one instead. <br /> <br />Also, the first DVD version comes with a great second disc of extras that will be interesting to anyone who enjoys the movie or comics and great fun for DD comics fans--great interviews with Frank Miller, John Romita Jr., etc. So to me the first version is the better movie and the better deal.
B00000I8NC|5.0|The purpose of this review is not to really review the album, but to attempt to clear things up on the BBF3 track's monologue.  While reading through the group's official website ([...] I ran across the monologue transcription with the following note: <br /> <br />NOTE: \\"his\\" poem which he recites at the end of this monologue is, in fact, not a poem by him at all, but an almost straight recital of the lyrics to virus by iron maiden. \\"Virus\\" was written by Blaze Bayley, former Iron Maiden vocalist, but the man on the recording is not actually Blaze. <br /> <br />Now, with that information being shared, I would like to express my opinon upon reading a comment that had written something like \\"GYBE praised the 9/11 attacks.\\"  On the Yanqui U.X.O. album, there is a track entitled \\"09-15-00.\\"  I interpreted this track as a tribute to all the victims.  Now, if there were ambient sound clips of people laughing in the background of this track, maybe my opinion would be different, but the song is very sad and mournful.   <br /> <br /> <br />I'm only 16 years old, so you may just dismiss all the previous information as \\"stupid\\" and invalid, but I would appreciate it if you took this review into consideration before immediately deciding that GYBE are strong anti-american stereotypical Canadians. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Now I can go back to being the 16 year old idiot that you may have expected. <br />OmGZ!

B000002J2D|3.0|Let me start with the fact that 'I am a fan of Genesis, good or bad (to an extent).  I even liked &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot; in spite of the relatively short and generally unrelated songs therin.  &quot;...and then there were three...&quot; contains some very imaginative writing, specifically with &quot;Undertow&quot;, &quot;Snowbound&quot;, &quot;Burning Rope&quot;, and &quot;Scenes from a Nights Dream&quot;, not to mention &quot;Follow you, Follow me.&quot; which I believe was also release as a single.<BR>But I feel the album has a slightly hollow sound with without Steve Hackett on-board.  In spite of this, though, the album was masterfully created and ranks high on my list of much played Genesis albums.
0783225733|5.0|This is an excellent movie. To all those who are laughing because they think this wasn't real enough: this is about as real to life as you're going to get in a non-documentary film. The special effects are excellent. I don't know how you could possibly do a rocket launch effect better than Mr. Howard's crew did. In addition, this movie is even more exciting, as the tagline, says, because it's all true. It's one of those movies that's so true to fact that you have to look at insignificant details like the color of Lovell's car before you can find inconsistencies between the movie and fact.
6304240554|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when I was only 9 years <br />old. Back when I was young, I didn't view this as a <br />scary movie at all. I'd actually would go outside <br />and pretend I was the leading role guy Ken Fortee <br />killing the zombies. Now, I have a different view <br />and realize just what it would be like for some <br />thing like this to really happen. The acting is <br />really realistic and more natural which could  <br />almost make you forget that this can't happen. <br /> <br />The music comes in at the right times that help <br />pull you into the movie. It's high in gore, but <br />no over the top that it isn't believeable. The <br />zombies look alot outdated... ESP the clothes  <br />they wear. But hey, it was 26 years ago and what  <br />can you really expect? I do think the movie drags <br />alittle bit at a latter part of the movie, but <br />that doesn't pull the movie down overall.  <br /> <br />The characters bring different things to the table... <br />Ken is is the take charge kind of guy that is the <br />toughest... Scott is kind of cocky and at times  <br />forgets the seriousness of the situation and also <br />sometimes borders on being insane... Flyboy is the <br />guy that handles the planes and is probably the <br />smartest of the four. Gaylen brings most of the <br />emotional feelings that the other 3 don't provide <br />very often.  <br /> <br />My favorite character is Ken because he is strong, <br />aware, and has most of the common sense. He's just <br />the type you want to lead your team. The one I dis- <br />liked most was Flyboy... He just seems out of place <br />at some spots and is sort of on the soft side and <br />he really lacked charisma . But in a way, his death <br />seemed to effect me more than the others. <br /> <br />Overall, I'd say this is one of the best horror movies <br />to come out. If you are picky about movies that look <br />dated this might turn you off. But if you are open <br />minded and like horror/zombie movies you are most <br />likely going to like this movie. <br /> <br />*Spoilers* <br /> <br />My favorite parts are when they are at the hangers, <br />Ken and Scott first going down into the mall, watching <br />them get all the weapons and the ending. I think people <br />misunderstood.... The ending is supposed to make you <br />wonder if they made it. When Gaylen Ross mentions how <br />low they are on gas that leaves me to under if they <br />\\"Made it\\" as the movie was ending.
B0002V7O3S|4.0|Looks at the claimed abduction of Travis Walton.  Shows how people react to claims of the UFO.  Great human responses in the movie.  It allows the viewer the ability to determine if they believe or not.  Focuses on the impact of the incident more than the incident itself, allowing the viewer to almost visualize more than shown.
0345457684|5.0|There are two competing stories in this book, so you've got to pay attention, or read it a second time. <br /> <br />First, and most obvious, is all the cosmic technology.  I won't go into it, because I don't want to spoil the surprises, but let's just say that the song fragments \\"Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling-a-ling?/Oh grave thy victory?\\" rings really true to these people. <br /> <br />Then there's the detective story, which demands - and repays - a lot of concentration all on its own. <br /> <br />Taken together, they're well done.  I really enjoyed this.
0380789019|5.0|Feeling woeful having exhausted the Douglas Adams books and Tom Robbins, I spent time reading lesser books by lesser writers. Having read Sandman occasionally, then spreading to other \\"graphic\\" novels by Gaiman, I found Neverwhere! Humorous, intelligent and captivating!! This writer creates a story that does not leave you! You will not want to put this down, but if you must for some reason, the depth, texture and details remain so vivid that you will not miss a step when you revisit the story. Some othe readers will speak of gaps or this being a \\"rough draft\\", I challenge them! This book offers mysteries, answers, fables, intrigue and a wonderful ride! I am addicted and so pleased that he is young! More to come!
0790729628|5.0|Blade Runner is the name of the police task force responsible for retiring (another word for terminating) artificial life forms (called Replicants) who get loose on Earth, where they are illegal because of their erratic and sometimes murderous behavior. Decker (Harrison Ford) is a retired Blade Runner, called back into service by his captain (M. Emmit Walsh) when five Replicants get loose in the futuristic Los Angeles area. <br /> <br />As Decker becomes acquainted with the newest Replicant models (Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Darryl Hannah) and the genetic engineers that manufacture them (William Sanderson), he begins to realize that nothing, including himself, is as it appears. <br /> <br />Ridley Scott has created the greatest science fiction masterpiece of all time. A brilliant screenplay, amazing set designs and special effects, and an unforgettable soundtrack by Vangelis combine to create a richly textured future world, and the film immediately transports the viewer into this world. It's the kind of film that never grows tiresome upon repeat viewings. <br /> <br />Many reviews complain about the lack of DVD special features. This is indeed sad, but don't wait for the new release to add this masterpiece to your collection. The more times you watch this film, the more you'll appreciate the new release when it finally does come out !
B0006399FS|5.0|While I respect the opinion of those who give this album only one star, I am quite disturbed by their insistence that everyone who likes the album must be insane or must be trying to validate their purchase.  Get a Life People.  if you don't like the album then fine for you but don't try to put down those of us who like it.  Or for that matter, don't put down U2 because their vision for their album isn't what you expected it to be.  I for one, love the album.  LOVE IT!!!  I jam my azz off whenever I turn on VERTIGO and All BECAUSE OF YOU and I put my hand over my heart when I hear A MAN AND A WOMAN.  This album is great and I can't wait to see them on tour in the spring.
0790733226|5.0|Anyone remotely familiar with Carl Sagan must know that getting away from the lights of a city, and looking up, leaves one to feel a flurry of emotions about it all when viewing the heavens at night. How can we be intelligent enough to build all of these tools to use, and still have room for doubt about the why? What if humans on an insignificant planet in the Cosmos actually did pick up a signal or make 'Contact' from outer space? How brave would you actually be? The movie 'Contact' presents this loneliness with a gentle and loving manner. The movie presents the greatest challenge -- do we survive, despite ourselves here on this insignificant speck like a grain of sand in all the grains of sand in all the beaches of the planet we live on? It really is not thought that humans would end it all, being even made to feel smaller than previously before by receiving advanced technology from aliens meant to meet this 'Contact', or is it a weapon? <br />But then again, they are extremely more intelligent, and give us hope, and fear, about the why and the what and the who and the how, but where are we, as humans, really at within the Grand Scheme of It All? The movie shows that the answer these questions give leave all even smaller and less advanced then we previously thought and still leaves the possibility open with all the awe and wonder Carl Sagan sought to show when talking about the Cosmos. The movie presents all of this with all the technological wonder it can muster at this Time and in this Space called SpaceTime. But then again, perhaps Carl Sagan should be remembered most for his love of life, and his thoughtfullness on why we as humans ought to survive and not create a Nuclear Winter Scenario by having a Nuclear War, a Holocaust due to hate and stupidity on this Planet Earth, in the Sol System, in the Persus Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy, one of the local group of 50 galaxies traveling together through SpaceTime at around 33 miles/ second traveling towards the SuperCluster Cluster of Strings of Galaxies near the Virgo Constellation only reaching that part of SpaceTime in another 300-400 million years, and still will we survive or make 'Contact' in that SpaceTime while we all are traveling in this SpaceTime and still find that everything else has moved that was there before in that region of SpaceTime, but yet find the strength and courage needed to survive? Perhaps, that is religion, perhaps it may be common sense, perhaps many emotions, some of which we may not have even discovered yet. Perhaps........ we are not alone afterall! <br />Perhaps! <br />
B000002J09|5.0|I was 11 when I first heard Stairway to Heaven on my cousin's 8-track (perhaps this dates me).  I loved the opening acoustic section, but then the bridge hit: \\"And it makes me wonder..\\", and at that moment I became utterly entranced by Zeppelin for ten years straight.  Since then I've cast off that spell, but once and a while I go back to that song...and it's just plain spooky.  How in the world did a masterwork of such balance, verve, yet restrained sophistication come forth from the rollicking British blues stealers who'd only a year before done such a goofball mix as Zeppelin 3?  It is a perfect song...in the best way.  That is, it's mood of epic, expansive melancholy resonates forever.  The hype is there for a reason: it's one thing when a song or album is purchased more than any other.  That kind of success can be engendered strictly by the perception of coolness and fashionability. But when a song is requested on radio more than any other in history, that's something very deep indeed.
B00004BZ0N|3.0|I just don't like the clash too much. They're just not me. I mean, how can anyone call this punk rock? What, you're trying to say that The Clash is right up there with The Vandals, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and The Sex Pistols? C'mon. And since when dies quality punk rock have trumpets? (Listen to Wrong Em Boyo) TRUMPETS? WHAT THE CRAP? I mean, the clash is cool and everything, but they have a lot of nerve to call themselves punk rock. Hey, i may be an inconsiderate moron who writes bad reviews and uses a aborted screen name to get into internet fourms, but i only speak what i think is true, and what i think is true is that the clash is NOT punk.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|When Sculpting The Throne Ov Seth came through my speakers, I knew I was in for a treat.  After the fitting and appealing acoustic intro, with a strong Eastern flare, I was pretty much pulverized.  I have never heard death metal that is this epic, this big and this abysmal.  The organized assault that was put upon my ears was beyond this world.    If you, the reader, aren't sure of what Behemoth is about, currently (they used to be a black metal band), I'd have to say they're about the most epic and apocalyptic death metal band in existence.  All of the songs on the album are, without a doubt, of a brutal nature.  There are some somewhat mid-paced moments, but I use this term with caution, as the brutality does not cease for a moment.  Now, believe it or not, I am usually not all that crazy about brutal music, as much of it is unorganized and undeveloped.  Behemoth defies this with rage.  The songs are structured extremely well and the musical development, from their early material to even comparisons to other bands, is phenomenal.  No one can deny the fact that this band is on top of what they're doing.    I usually do not take much concern of lyrics, however, the lyrics on Demigod are fantastic and worth mention.  The lyrics here would certainly have any Thelemic metal fan drooling, not to mention anyone with a fairly deep interest in mythology and history, particularly of the East.  Death metal has never sounded so intelligent.    To sum up my review, if you're a death metal fan, you need this album as you do water.  For those that aren't too keen on death metal and/or brutal music, you may find Demigod to be quite a treat - give it a shot!  For all those that are ordering, prepare to be maimed by the infernal horde known as Behemoth!
B0000027RL|5.0|a must have for anyone getting into pearl jam or the grunge rock scene, this is an unforgettable album that will turn heads time and time again. (...)
B00005JNEI|4.0|I am currently a junior in college and majoring in Political Science so I was very interested in seeing this film. When you are aware of the source (Moore) and his views on the country this \\"documentary\\" can be a helpful educational tool, but you must not take 100% of this to heart.  <br /> <br />Moore does not make things up, BUT he does present some of the facts of the movie in a way that makes them more shocking than they are in reality. For example : Moore makes a big deal of the fact that the Bush family has personal/business ties to the bin Laden family, which taken on its face IS shocking, but when you research it you will learn that anyone with a business hand in oil has relations with the bin Laden family, and it is a huge family, who disowned the infamous Osama. So the fact that the Bush's associate with the large bin Laden family shouldn't be quite as shocking as it comes across.  <br /> <br />So while his movie is filled with actual facts some of the things he points out aren't really as uncommon as he would like us to believe (like the segment which he is SHOCKED to learn that members of Congress don't read all of the bills they pass in their entirety... well DUHHHH they are thousands of pages and there are tons of them!)  <br /> <br />On the otherhand some of the things simply are shocking, and there is no way around them, such as the mother of a fallen solider sharing her story of how her sons final government check was docked the days of that week in which he was dead. That's disgustingly disrespectful of our government.  <br /> <br />I have to say I enjoyed the film. Moore has a way of infusing entertainment into his fact. He does make several points and theories as to why the wars following 9-11 happened.  <br /> <br />I think that if you view this movie with a sceptical eye you will be satisfied with it. Just go into viewing it after you learn a bit about Moore and his agenda. As with everything that has to do with politics there is always an agenda, and if you go into this movie aware of Moore's agenda you will know what to black out and what to take in. Just read up on his facts and listen to all sides of the story. But Moore's point of view is as valuable as anyones and worth all of the recognition.  <br />
B00028U6B8|5.0|Volunteers was released in 1969 and is the last of the Jefferson Airplane albums to feature their classic lineup. While their previous studio albums After Bathing At Baxter's and Crown Of Creation were both strong and diverse releases, they also had a few songs which were uneven. Although many would say Surrealistic Pillow is their best album because it has their biggest hits \\"White Rabbit\\" and \\"Somebody To Love\\" and other popular songs, Volunteers plays more to the band's strengths in that it's a more musically diverse collection while still showcasing the band's songwriting skills. You could make similarities to the Doors in this aspect as their debut album also had more classic songs but it was on their Morrison Hotel release where they truly put it all together.<br /><br />The first half of Volunteers has a strong good time feel to it beginning with the the excellent \\"We Can Be Together\\" which is carried throughout by Jorma Kaukonen's melodic lead work and the soaring harmonies of Grace Slick, Paul Kantner, and Marty Balin. What truly makes the song magical is longtime session man Nicky Hopkins whose piano work truly shines here. The tracks \\"Good Shepherd\\" and the countryish \\"The Farm\\" continue the upbeat mood while \\"Turn My Life Down\\" is a great track featuring the rare mix of acoustic guitar and Hammond B-3 organ along with a great lead vocal from Balin. The epic \\"Hey Frederick\\" is outstanding, featuring great vocals from Slick and a long jam at the end which shows the great interplay among Kaukonen, Hopkins, and the rhythm section of Jack Casady and Spencer Dryden. The album's second half is moodier but just as impressive. \\"Wooden Ships\\", written by Kantner and CSN members David Crosby and Stephen Stills, is an excellent track and one of the most memorable from the era. Although the CSN version performed on their self-titled debut is the more popular version, the Airplane's version is nearly as impressive, having a looser feel in both its harmonies and execution. \\"Eskimo Blue Day\\" is another moody epic from Slick while \\"A Song For All Seasons\\" is another upbeat country tune. Finally, the title track is one of their most enduring songs and one of the great anti-war anthems of the 1960's. Like all of their classic releases, the album has been remastered and features a generous portion of bonus tracks. In this case, it's five live tracks from a performance at the Fillmore East in November 1969 which cement the Airplane's reputation as a phenomenal live band. Casady's inventive bass playing is way up in the mix and a highlight of energetic versions of \\"Somebody To Love\\" and \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover.\\" The live perfomances of \\"Good Shepherd\\", \\"Volunteers\\", and \\"Wooden Ships\\" are very good as well. Overall, a fantastic album and one of the best from the Woodstock era. Highly recommended.cution. \\"Eskimo Blue Day\\" is another moody epic from Slick while \\"A Song For All Seasons\\" is another upbeat country tune.

B0006IIPIK|1.0|I just finished watching this thing and wanted to knock off a review while my astonished outrage is fresh. <br />It boggles the mind that such talent as Jude Law, Gweneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie were persuaded to sign on for this project. They must be hoping that no one notices. It died quickly enough in the theaters and should move quickly from the \\"new release\\" rack at Blockbuster to the used overstock rack. <br />Considering the extensive use of computer graphics, I found myself wondering why they didn't just dispense with human actors altogether and do the whole thing with 1s and 0s. <br />The plot line and dialog are so unbearably cliched that my dog began to wonder if I was sick - I was groaning so frequently. <br />This thing borrows, steals, plagarizes from everyone from Fritz Lang to Bruce McCall as Sky Captain and his newspaperwoman girlfriend Polly chase all over the world in search of a bad guy named Totenkopf. <br />Totenkopf, for Pete's sake. Can you believe they were so unsubtle as to name the bad guy after the totenkopf - death's head - symbol of the Nazi SS? How desperately cheesy! <br />The only reason I can think of to sit through the whole thing is to hear the photographers in the audience laugh at the last line in the movie. <br />I got sucked in because of the stylish look of the trailer, even though the movie guru at my local Blockbuster tried to warn me off. <br />Do yourself a big favor and view a rental copy before you decide whether to own it. You'll thank me.
B0006M4SO6|4.0|The latest effort by the Pat Metheny Group is quite unique for many reasons. First of all, what I find intersting are the mixed reviews that are out there!. It appears that some people love this disc was others simpily don't get it!.Well, I can kind of relate to both sides, because when I first heard this disc I did'nt really get it. However, as pat said in Jazz Wise magazine, you really need to listen to it about ten times before you actually can understand it. I have to say that as I continue to listen to it really grows on me. The whole piece seems to remind me of previous recordings. For instance, Imiganary Day, Trio, Speaking of Now, even Offramp. I think this record is almost a summary of Metheny over the last 25 years, summed up in a single recording. As with any other recording that I have heard by Pat the melodies seems to haunt me when I least expect it. I don't agree with the reviewers who have said there is no melody. It is there if you spend the time to really listen too it. Ultimitaly, the concerts in February should help solve this musical mystery. Until then, buy this record and spend quality time with it, for it will pay off- as the journey will will take you somewhere new!!
B000075BFK|5.0|When it comes the bottom of it, this is just a classic cd, and is worthy of your money because this is the best cd of 2002. Bar None. <br /> <br />I liked the beats, their much better than  loyal to the games' no offence to eminem. Mya,tyrese, mr. biggs, trick daddy were decent. Although 2pac stole the show, he ripped it like only he can, I got to put this up as tied with still I rise, for the third best post-death pac cd, makaveli and until the end of time were slightly better, not to take anything way against this cd because this is an excellent cd and is made by the greatest musican of all time, so pick it up if you haven't already.
006054094X|1.0|The studies of native american indians from all over North and South America, done by such scientists as Spencer Wells, does NOT show these peoples to have DNA in common with the modern Chinese that would thus be showing a common ancestor of the two peoples that lived just around 580 to 600 years ago (or 29 to 30 generations ago). The DNA sequeances the two groups share show common ancestors more like 12,000 years ago (or 600 generations ago). Therefore, theories in this book of any 15th century Chinese settling in the americas and becoming the direct ancestors of some modern day native North Americans or native South Americans is obviously all wrong.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Great album by the Guns, but ain't it need 2 others from the <br />Illusion II? It does. It needs 14 Years, and Estranged, 2 really <br />good songs. The rest fit. My favorite songs on this album are <br />Sweet Child O' Mine and November Rain. I also like a lot of the <br />others like Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, Knockin' On <br />Heaven's Door, Civil War, You Could Be Mine, & Live and Let Die. <br />If this greatest hits album was edited, I would then get this. <br />But heres the greatest hits album if I edited this with different <br />tracks. <br /> <br />  1.

B0007GBBVO|4.0|\\"Field-sequential\\" or \\"alternating-image\\" 3-D isn't a new idea on video.  The biggest push for it was in the mid-80s by JVC for their VHD format.  That format didn't make it in the US, but many of the 3-D movies they transferred have been endlessly copied to make bootleg tapes and DVDs.<br /><br />Since then, other movies have been released in that format, but they're all either shot on video with a NuView camcorder adaptor, \\"converted\\" from 2-D movies, or a few CGI IMAX 3-D movies.  None of the many films photographed in 3-D over the last fifty years or so are available in good, legit 3-D DVDs.<br /><br />Until now, that is.  This disc marks a major stride forward for the format.  Here we have a nice, clean, well-registered transfer of a 3-D film presented in 3-D.<br /><br />How good is the 3-D and the transfer?  Pretty darn good.  The transfer is slightly narrower than the movie was intended to be.  I'm told this is because there were some problems with the film that made it necessary to crop it down a bit.  Overall, it came out OK, but there are several scenes that have action too near the edge of the screen.  Even on a non-overscanning display, it's a bit too tight.<br /><br />As usual in 3-D movies, there are some scenes that just don't work.  That's not the fault of this disc, but it makes some scenes tough to watch.  Unfortunately, the worst shot is the very first.  It's pretty much unwatchable.  The good news is it only lasts as long as the opening credits and things pick up considerably from there.<br /><br />Speaking of watching, what do you need to watch this?  To watch it on a TV, you'll need shutter glasses (not included, but widely available) and an interlaced display.  That means you can't use a plasma or LCD display and you'll need to disable progressive display on your DVD player.  If you can't do that, there are options for viewing on computers with certain combinations of hardware and software.<br /><br />So the 3-D's good, how's the disc?  Other than the nice presentation of the film, the disc is plain-jane, lacking not only special features, but subtitles and closed-captions as well.  The usual 3-D setup test pattern is available, and the menus are in 3-D as well, which is nice to make sure your system is up and running right.  The disc has chapters in appropriate places.<br /><br />Sounds good, but how's the movie?  Well, this review is for this disc and the 3-D presentation here- you can find plenty of reviews of the flat version here on Amazon and elsewhere.  I'm not recommending the disc for the movie itself, though if you can handle the goofy tone the filmmakers obviously intended, it's well made and fluffy enough that it's tough to be too hard on it.  And Dracula really is fantastic.  I've seen a lot of movies that were a lot worse, both in 3-D and flat.<br /><br />Bottom line: for 3-D enthusiasts and collectors (and fans of this movie, I guess), this disc is a must have.  This is, hands down, the best way to watch this movie on video.  3D For Your TV could have a hit on their hands, and almost certainly will if they can find some better (or at least better known) movies for their future projects.isc?

B000000OSE|5.0|I actully would like to get this album, November Rain is one of <br />GN'R's greatest songs I have ever heard with great guitar works <br />by Slash, it's my favorite song next to Sweet Child Of Mine. I <br />also like Live and Let Die. Great combo for Appetite for Destruction, & Use Your Illusion II.
B000679N96|3.0|Just pointing out that the beginning of The Weedy Burton is missing (studio chatter). The end of Three Imaginary Boys has too much silence (guess the pro remixing idiot didn't hear the studio talk) , don't these people at least listen to the original mix, before they RUIN it. There may be more wrong, but I'm too piffed off to listen again.
B000000OQF|5.0|I'm eventually gonna listen to more songs on this album, but I <br />want to tell you this album is awesome for the 3 great songs, <br />\\"Welcome to the Jungle\\", \\"Paradise City\\", & \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" <br />which that's my favorite song. Does Nightrain, Brownstone, and <br />Rocket seem others that are good? I want to listen to all those <br />songs. Any rock fan must own this album by Guns N' Roses.  <br />And is one of my favorites of all time and in addition to this <br />album, I like \\"On Every Street\\" in addition to this CD.
B000002LUB|5.0|Dio gives a spirited performance in this Classic offering. Black Sabbath with Dio, Iommi, Butler and Vinnie Appice are something special indeed. This 3rd Black Sabbath line-up has a real feel for making deep minded and soulful Music. Dio sounds angry as he teases the audiance with his performance on this 1992 disk. Vinnie Appice drives this awe inspiring collection with a powerfull performance. Iommi's guitar is in fine form. Butler is credited with being the lead writer for DeHumanizer.
B00000DGUY|5.0|LISTEN this is my all time FAVOURITE album by Dire Straits. <br />My name is listed in this album, such as my other friends, Money <br />FOr Nothing, Sultans of Swing, & Tunnel of Love. I love this <br />album because it has some of the best music I have ever heard. <br />But there is missing a few songs, \\"The Bug\\", & \\"Skateaway\\", & <br />\\"When It Comes to You\\". If this album was edited also here's <br />what tracks I would add. <br /> <br />  1. Sultans of Swing <br />  2. Lady Writer <br />  3. Tunnel of Love <br />  4. Skateaway <br />  5. Twisting by the Pool <br />  6. So Far Away  <br />  7. Money for Nothing <br />  8. Walk of Life <br />  9. Calling Elvis <br /> 10. Heavy Fuel <br /> 11. The Bug <br /> 12. On Every Street <br /> 13. When It Comes to You <br />  <br />Insted of bad songs like \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", \\"Private Investigations\\", \\"Love over Gold\\", & \\"Brothers in Arms\\" I reccomend 2 other bonus tracks to this second Sultans of Swing/The Very Best of Dire Straits in addition to the first. <br />Also everyone read this review.
0156027321|5.0|`Life of Pi\\" was indeed a great book to kick-start my reading program for the year.  <br /> <br />The storyline is simple and straightforward. A boy (Pi Patel) from India decided to migrate to Canada together with his family and the animals from his zoo. Unfortunately, their ship sank in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Pi's parents went missing and he himself was left stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger. Exciting encounters with the tiger and the surrounding environment followed as Pi engages in a human vs nature battle.  <br /> <br />However, a deeper message underlies the simplicity of the plot. `Life of Pi' is a story of human strength, optimism, courage and wits in times of crisis. It is a story about believing in yourself and in God's willingness to help you out. It is also a story about trusting unconventional experiences and thinking out of the box, as evident from the last chapter.  <br /> <br />Yann Martel injects a healthy dose of humour into his skilful storytelling, making the story highly enjoyable and light-hearted. He packages themes like religions and God, survival and death in a more palatable way for the reader. `Life of Pi' may appear to be a children's book on first glance, but let it simmer in you after a first read and you will find yourself relishing in the afterthought. For those who do not believe in God, reading this book will probably not change your mindset, but it certainly allows you to see this world in a much more positive light.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|You already know that I'm on the album and you know my name. It's <br />a great album by Dire Straits. I like 5 interesting rock songs. <br />The rock songs are Calling Elvis, The Bug, & Heavy Fuel (my name). I also like On Every Street as it's another rock song. <br />And the last I listened to was When It Comes to You. So I can't <br />quit listening to this album and I would recommend it to Sultans <br />of Swing/The Very Best of Dire Straits. Be sure to read my review <br />as I'm working on even more.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I'm not the type of person to take the time to write reviews, but Ms. Peyroux's CD and talent make's this becomes my first. <br /> <br />Reviews I've read comparing her style to Billie Holiday's I couldn't disagree with more.  These people read (listen) with a bias to begin with, and any singer that sings in a range and a style close to Billie Holiday gets tagged.  If these people would take the time to truely listen, Ms. Peyroux's CD provides a range and style uniquely her own. <br /> <br />The CD offers a variety, some song stronger than others, but the overall portfolio of songs is balanced and every one is truely well done.  The band and mix is great, riffs bubbling up, and a different mix of instruments (organ). <br /> <br />Never have I purchased a CD that I don't tire of after awhile, so this also is a first.   <br /> <br />After buying this CD, it was no question not to purchase the debute CD, and I look forward to the next.  I also hope someday to hear her in concert.
B000000OSG|4.0|I actully liked this album pretty good though the best songs on <br />this album are \\"Civil War\\", \\"Fourteen Years\\", \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\", \\"Estranged\\", & \\"You Could Be Mine\\". The one that <br />sucks is Get in the Ring.
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />This album is straight up awful and you know it. I find it humourous that all these U2 worshippers are on here posting under false names just to be able to give this steaming pile 5 stars 20 times to offset the true reviews. This is plain stupid noise by whiney drunks. <br /> <br />Bono has nothing left to say. Pathethic <br />
B0006IIPIK|5.0|It's a shame that this movie didn't do so well, as it was a pretty cool movie.  It didn't even recoup half of what it cost to make, and judging by the amazing effects this movie had, I'm guessing that it was pretty expensive.  I blame marketing; I cannot remember ever wanting to see it until after it was released on DVD, and people I know and online reviewers told me to go see it. <br />In New York City, circa 1939 (albeit, an alternate timeline 1939), reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) has been investigating a group of scientists who have been mysteriously disappearing.  All of them have been linked to a pre-WWI project based out of Berlin and led by a mysterious man named Totenkopf.  Soon after meeting with the 7th scientist, a legion of giant robots begin attacking the city, and only Joseph \\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan (Jude Law) can save the day.  After he barely fights off the bots, the mechanical menaces receive a radio signal that Sky Captain's assistant, Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi) begins to trace.  Dex is kind of like the Q to Sky Captain's James Bond; he makes gadgets and modifications to the planes used by Sky Captain and his \\"army for hire\\". <br />Soon, Polly and Sky Captain begin a journey to find Totenkopf and discover why he has been sending his robots to destroy major cities (New York wasn't the only target).  Along the way, they meet up with Sky Captain's old friend Francesca \\"Franky\\" Cook (Angelina Jolie), a Royal Navy commander with one of the coolest air fleets ever to appear on film (although her role is more of a cameo than a featured one, as the trailers and box art would have you believe). <br />If I could, I guess I would give this movie 4 and 1/2 stars instead of 5, but since I can't I feel that it deserves the 5 rather than the 4.  I can kind of see why some people didn't like this movie; there were some lapses in logic, and some of the situations seem kind of dated.  What the naysayers don't understand is, that was kind of the point.This movie is a homage to old 1940's and 50's era comics and adventure stories.  One could almost call this \\"Indiana Jones meets Star Wars\\" (which I think the director really was going for, since there is a George Lucas reference on one of the scientist's doors).  This film isn't about winning Oscars (except maybe in the visual effects categories), it's about retro fun.  It's about paying respect to classic filmmaking that we really don't get to see anymore.  This is a must-see for any Lucas/Speilberg fan, and I would really reccomend it to anyone.
B000001FG5|5.0|How can you follow the success of \\"SaturdayNightFever?\\"This 1979 album,\\"Spirits Having Flown\\"did.I remember hearing the first single,\\"Too Much Heaven\\" on a TV special event,and fell in love with it.\\"Tragedy\\" was so different,and they showed the Bee Gees recording this cut,and how Barry made the gun sound blowing through his hands.A real gun didn't sound right.Most of the cuts were played on the radio or in the clubs,and it seemed like the Bee Gees would turn out hits forever,and they did for other Artist after this huge hit,but \\"Spirits Having Flown\\" was the peek for the Bee Gees.
B000067J1H|4.0|For a while, people have kept telling me to see this movie, saying that it is amazing, and it will change my life, so I went into it with some really high expectations.  It's a shame, because I feel that if I had been expecting a little less, I would have liked this movie more.  I'm not saying that Fight Club is a bad movie, all I'm saying is that I don't get it the way some people do (although there are many people who don't get some of my favorite movies the way I do, such as Lost In Translation and Garden State). <br />Edward Norton plays the unnamed Narrator, an insomniac who is obsessed with material goods, namely furniture.  When his condo, and by default, all of his furniture, is destroyed in an explosion, he moves in with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a strange but intriguing man that he met on an airplane.  Tyler's home could not be more different from the Narrator's; the house was dilapidated, it had almost no furniture, save a few beds and tables, and was beyond an eyesore.  But it doesn't matter because the two men become good friends.  Eventually, they start Fight Club, which is kind of like a support group for men who want to just let loose and blow off some steam.  At first, the two are really into it, and it is a small, exclusive little thing.  But soon it grows until there are clubs all over the country, and membership reaches numbers greater than 1,000.  That's when things start to get weird for the narrator.  People start acting very different around him, and they seem to blindly follow Tyler in whatever he does. <br />Also, there is this girl named Marla (Helena Bonam-Carter, who does not look to good in this film) who is somewhat of a mystery to the Narrator.  She always seems to be over to make love with Tyler, but when they're done, she tries to talk to the Narrator.  He is confused by the situation, and it causes her to get really angry and storm out. <br />I don't know; some of the people I know have said that this is one of those movies that you have to view more than once in order to fully understand, but as much as I enjoyed it, I feel that once is enough for a while.  I would suggest checking it out- as long as you can handle a lot of violence (the movie is called Fight Club, so what do you expect?), and some nudity.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Too much romance to be a war movie.  Too much war to be a romance movie.  Whatever you want to call this hodgepodge of dramatic cliches, don't dare call it \\"historical.\\"  Like \\"Titanic,\\" which suffers from a similar affliction, the fact that celluloid was even wasted on this is supremely insulting to the real people who actually lived through the events.  The worst aspect of it is that it was obviously intended as a means to purely commercial ends, riding into theaters on the coattails of far more artistically and morally distinguished movies like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Band of Brothers\\" and the groundswell of renewed interest in World War II which followed them. <br /> <br />If you want to watch a reasonably accurate dramatization of what actually happened at Pearl Harbor, your money will be better spent on the classic \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\"
B00001QEBQ|5.0|This should be a story that every mother watches with her daughter.  Well children cause my children and I love it.  Of course they like that it's animated, there's singing not to mention talking animals.  BUT for me it's a strong and courageous story, in which a young woman realizes that she has to assume responsibility for her family!<br /><br />Mulan is now a young woman it's time to be a wife.  Her visit with the matchmaker is the worse.  The matchmaker tells her that she will never bring her family honor.<br /><br />The Huns are attacking China.  Every village needs to send a male to represent their family.  Unfortunately Mulan is and only child.<br /><br />Instead of allowing her father the only man in her family to go Mulan disguises herself as a man to help her family and her country. Her ancestors send a dragon in an effort to bring her back in order not to disgrace them.  In boot camp, she's learning to fit in with the other soldiers.  Mushu (voice of Eddie Murphy) a wise cracking dragon becomes her helpful sidekick. Mulan at times is barely able to maintain her secret.  BUT through all of her struggles we see as Mulan learns that she doesn't have to be perfect.<br /><br />As they come face to face with The Huns we see as they work as a team.  I love that Mulan isn't all looking for a man and needs one to define her!  Although it's obvious that she is attracted to Shang.<br /><br />This is such a powerful story filled with determination not to mention the vibrant colors.  I can't wait for part II.
0316172324|3.0|A fun read, but a little frustrating. Now that I know that I make decisions based on unconscious interpretations, how do I tap into that part of me (the \\"locked door\\") so I can understand and even change how I work?    After the widespread media coverage on the passing of Johnny Carson last week--there was a day when you could see clips of the (still) wildly popular Johnny on TV again all day--it struck me that Johnny and George W. Bush have a similar look about them. And I had a flash of thought: might this be one reason why W. is so popular, because America is really voting for somebody who reminds them of Johnny and the \\"good old days\\" then?    I sure blinked when I had that thought.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Van Helsing is no doubt the worst movie of 2004 next to Garfield and Chronicles of Riddick. This movie is so boring and filled with too many CGI effects the only scenes we made it to were the the b&w prologue and the scene were Van Helsing and the womman were battling white monsters. Please avoid this one like the plague, This one is recommended for video gamers and 10 year old kids but if you have trouble sleeping watch this movie to get a better sleep.
B00067BBQE|5.0|Yes, the video editing of the live convert could have been better. There was far too much flicking between camcera angles. However, it is still a great DVD/CD deal. Evanescence is still awesome, the bundled relase videos is a bonus. Finally in one place you can get all 4 of their videos. And if after watching this DVD, you are not a fan of Evanescence.... someone been planting the wrong flowers on your grave.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is an INCREDIBLE album. Looking at the titles on it, you'd think you were looking at the titles on a greatest hits album. There's not a song on here that I haven't heard countless times on the radio.<br /><br />My thoughts (and ratings) of the songs on Revolver:<br /><br />1. Taxman (4/5) - Great George song. Guaranteed to be played on radio stations everywhere each April 15th. Excellent background vocals on this one.<br />2. Eleanor Rigby (5/5) - Brilliant on so many levels that it's almost mind-boggling. The music itself is beautiful. The lyrics are heartbreaking, yet it's still a \\"happy-sounding song.\\" One of McCartney's absolute best.<br />3. I'm Only Sleeping (5/5) - Great Lennon song. His solo song \\"Watching The Wheels\\" could almost be considered a sequel to this. Both have the same sort of \\"people say I'm crazy, but I don't care\\" vibe to them.<br />4. Love You To (3/5) - A psychedelic one from George. My least favorite song on the album. Great music, but I'm not in love with the lyrics.<br />5. Here, There, And Everywhere (5/5) - Sappy lyrics? Some might say so, but I don't think so. Who wouldn't want to feel the kind of love Paul sings of in this song?<br />6. Yellow Submarine (5/5) - A little silly? Sure. A whole lot of fun? Definitely!<br />7. She Said She Said (5/5) - Wow, such a big contrast from the previous track, but an awesome song. Very cool lyrics.<br />8. Good Day Sunshine (5/5) - Try singing along with this without feeling great while doing it. Can't do it, can you?<br />9. And Your Bird Can Sing (5/5) - Great guitar riff and truly fantastic vocals. One of my most favorite Beatles songs.<br />10. For No One (5/5) - Underrated gem from Paul. Another song with sad lyrics, yet upbeat music. The girl Paul sings about could easily have gone on to be the girl in She's Leaving Home.<br />11. Doctor Robert (5/5) - Great clever Lennon lyrics, plus great harmony and background vocals. Also, the guitars sound awesome.<br />12. I Want To Tell You (5/5) - George's best song on the album. Short tune, but great tune.<br />13. Got To Get You Into My Life (5/5) - Yeah, it's incredibly popular, but I still think it's underrated. With it's blending of traditional rock and roll with jazzy horns, this song was about 10 years ahead of its time.<br />14. Tomorrow Never Knows (5/5) - This is one hell of a creative song. There's so much going on here musically. A perfect song to close the album with.<br /><br />People often say they feel Revolver is the best Beatles album. They may be right. Personally, I can never decide between it and Abbey Road. For me, it's a tie between the two.<br /><br />I stick with how I titled this review.

B0006399FS|5.0|Unlike what many people have bizzarely said, I think this album is a testament to the staying power of a band which, theoretically, should suck by now, but has never even hinted at jumping the proverbial shark. <br />U2 decides to go even more back to the primal roots of rock and roll than they did on \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", with high-voltage, continually fun results. <br />Songs like the first two singles, \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"All Because of You\\" have no problem raising an uptempo frenzy, while inspired moments such as the tracks \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", \\"One Step Closer\\", and \\"Original Of The Species\\" place forth the undeniable heart that keeps the band from sinking to the depths of creative stagnation and banality that await the fate of most popular bands. <br />From the beginning of Vertigo, with its cookily incorrect Spanish counting, to the final ringing strains of the comforting Yahweh, I did not cease to be both satisfied and pleasantly bemused by the ongoing coolness of these Atomic Dismantlers for the new millenium. <br />In short, this record is the definition of the withstanding appeal of U2. <br />I can confidently say I am quite excited about whatever they do next!
B000002BFZ|3.0|Few musicians seem to resent--nay, to hate--the spotlight as much as Eddie Vedder, and this album at times feels like a calculated attempt to run away from it.<br /><br />It's not the songs that do this--they're often great, especially fan favorites like \\"Hail, Hail\\" and \\"Off He Goes.\\" No, it's the sequencing, which leaves the listener feeling like an airline passenger buffeted by heavy turbulence. The slow-fast-slow-fast order doubtless turned many fans away and left them rooting through their Case Logics for their old copies of \\"Ten.\\" Those who gave it a few listens, though, usually came to realize that there were some real gems here, songs that have become staples of their (frequently excellent) concerts and live discs.<br /><br />My advice is to listen to the tracks in the following order: 1,2,4,8,9,7,5,3,6,10,11,13. Leave out 12--good ol' Eddie has marred far too many of his own albums with pretentious ramblings. (Vitalogy being perhaps the best example of this--it would have been near perfect without \\"Bugs\\" and the final track.) I hate using the \\"skip\\" buttons, but the whole album sounds better that way. (If you can come up with a better sequencing, please email it or post it.) Or just pick up the three-disc set from their final Seattle show on November 6, 2000. It's surely one of the best live albums by any band, ever, and it carries an energy and vitality too often lacking in Pearl Jam's later studio output.
B000687M48|4.0|man.  <br /> <br />i was a big fan of the band when i got their original CD. this one doesnd do them justice. amy lee's voice is gorgeous. but i have yet to see the dvd. its pretty good. i dont normally go out and buy cds but this one is a must have if u are a fan of evanescence. =)
B00008J4P5|5.0|Jack White has a serious chip on his shoulder.<br /><br />On this album, recorded in London with pre-1963 equipment, packaged like an early Stones ABCKO release, he's a one-man army, a ferocious, charging, snarling attack dog on the guitar, kept leashed only by Meg's spare, effective drumming. He plays as if determined to prove that, had he been born forty years earlier, and had he come up in London instead of Detroit, he might well have been at the vanguard of the British Invasion. Indeed, he seems determined to re-create the whole dad-gummed thing, from early Sixties pop to mid-Seventies metal.<br /><br />Astonishingly, he succeeds, or better yet, re-imagines it in a way that his songs sound fresh and new, instant classics so good you wonder why no one ever bothered to write them before. With a thumping guitar intro here and an angry Black Sabbath-esque riff there, he storms through some great angry songs, with the occasional soft ballad or tongue-in-cheek closer thrown in to lighten things up.<br /><br />What's more, the lyrics and vocal delivery are every bit equal to his guitar onslaught. When he snarls \\"I had opinions that didn't matter, I had a brain that felt like pancake batter,\\" somehow, you know what he's talking about. It's not a completely perfect album--\\"Ball and a Biscuit\\" sometimes seems pretentiously long--but it's better than almost anything out there today, and as good as one has any right to expect.
B0006V6TMG|4.0|In general I like live recordings and I certainly like Jesse Cook.  Good performers and good audiences create great performances.  For an example of this synergy, try the bonus video tracks of \\"Mario Takes A Walk\\" and \\"Rattle And Burn\\" on Jesse Cook's \\"Free Fall\\".  The energy in these performances is, literally, hair-raising.   <br /> <br />In \\"Montreal: Live\\" the audience is clearly ready to help the performers, much of the band's work is impressive, and Jesse Cook's playing is technically superlative but... The overall feel is Jesse Cook and the band are basically going through the numbers, albeit with some gusto.  There are some flashes of fire in the violin and percussion on occasion but nothing that's sustained.  It isn't until \\"Dance of Spring\\" (track 11 of 13 tracks) that the playing really catches fire despite the obvious energy from the crowd all through the show.  \\"Baghdad\\" continues the feel started in \\"Dance of Spring\\" although the intro lets some of the steam out before it's restored.  Then comes \\"Fall at Your Feet\\".  Placed elsewhere into the performance it would have been acceptable.  It's not an encore number and it's not a big closer - it's just plain in the wrong place in the set.   <br /> <br />If you do not know Jesse Cook's work, try \\"Free Fall\\" or \\"Gravity\\" first.  If you like his work, buy \\"Montreal: Live\\" but don't expect a stunning performance.  It's close but not quite there.   <br /> <br />--- <br /> <br />Technical asides: Live albums and crowd noise first.  Drunks yelling \\"play bleepin' 'Freebird', man\\" in the middle of an inspired acapella rendition of \\"Seven Bridges Road\\" should be strung up by the neck and left dangling, as an example for other would-be fools.  But an auduence that's into the performance and is with the performers becomes an integral part of the performance and not just a flaw to be ignored.  I can think of live albums where audience sounds are all but lost and the result is more like an odd studio album without the immediacy of the audience keeping time or cheering brilliant playing.  <br /> <br />Jesse Cook's runs in \\"Montreal: Live\\" are, as best I can tell, backed by the percussion section and not solely the result of pickup noise or overloading.  Where he's playing on the fingerboard, the notes, on even the best of guitars, simply lack the ring of lower registers.  In a lesser player, the runs might seem flawed but I'm confident that what's played is played by choice.
B0000268M6|5.0|I'm not a fan of classical music at all, more into stoner rock but i heard le onde the song and i just fell in love with it, i listenend to the album and ALL the songs,yup every single one is just 5/5 , its a great chillout cd and Einaudi is a brillant piano player and every song works...a seriously great buy for any classical or piano fan, also recommened for anyone, this is just one of them cd's that you will not be able to put down. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AK7AG|3.0|Sorry to all who love this movie.  It is cute and loveable and really quite good by kid-vid standards; and I know it's not fair to judge a film by the book its based on:  but this could have been so much more inspiring and less silly.  I thought this show was cartoon-like, but stylish, until I read the book to my daughter.  Now I think it is stylish but cheap.<br /><br />Dear film makers: if you have to use cute singing mice, evil cats, dumb ducks, bad pig wigs and creepy moving animal lips, please pile them on a story that needs that kind of help.  Leave Dick King-Smith and E. B. White alone, thank you.  I just don't believe classic tales, especially modern classics, need to be puffed up with this kind of pop-pandering padding.<br /><br />On the positive side, This video is way better than the really, really dumb sequel.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|2004's \\"VAN HELSING\\" is a special effects extravaganza. Some might think this is a good thing. I, on the other hand feel that it fails in the same way that 2003's \\"HULK\\" failed. First of all there are to many classic monsters in one movie. The actor that played Dracula should be shot. He was horrid. It was almost a comedic performance. He is probably the worse thing about the movie. Dracula is one of my favorite characters in film history, but it takes the right actor to play him. I'll take Gary Oldman anyday. Well enough about that. The story is ludicrous. Somehow Hollwood can bring Freddy and Jason together more believably than Dracula and Frankenstien, go figure.. In my one man's opinion, I feel that if you're gonna make a BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER movie, you should just call it that. I was inspired to watch 1992's \\"BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA\\" again (which features the character Van Helsing, played by Anthony Hopkins). I recommend you skip \\"VAN HELSING\\" and go with \\"BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA\\" instead. It's a classic. This film isn't. By the way there is a BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER movie, it's a comedy that stars Kristy Swanson as a cheerleader turned vampire slayer.
0440236738|4.0|This was such a fun book to read.  My book club at work picked this for our monthly selection and all of us enjoyed it immensely.  I must agree with some of the other reviewers that there were not that many likeable characters and it was hard to really care about anyone.  However, it was fast-paced, had a lot of twists and turns and kept us all guessing to the end.  Enjoy!
B000002KB8|1.0|I've been a fan for a while now, starting with Ozzy's solo stuff then moving on to Sabbath.  I just bought this album. I love Black Sabbath's raw sound which isn't over produced, but this album is just plain nasty! Ozzy sounds like he'd just smoked two packs of cigarettes before laying down the vocals in the studio.  In terms of historical importance (musically speaking) that title is more appropiate for Paranoid. I'm sure there are some purists up in arms over is---but if it sounds like [...] than it probably is. Skip is album and purchases the following:  1. 'Sold our soul for rock 'n' roll' If you like what you hear...  2. purchase 'Symptom of the Universe'  3. and then Black Sabbath Vol.4 to round it all off.    If your new to Sabbath, don't start out with this album.  And even if your not........still don't purchase it.
B00006879E|3.0|Defiantly not extraordinary, but a little out of the ordinary nonetheless. <br /> <br />Its easy to listen to, and enjoyable. Definatly worth a few spins. <br /> <br />If you can find it cheap (just buy a used one from here), then its a good buy,
B00008BXJ6|5.0|From beginning to end, this a solid debut album that's still as fresh sounding as when it was recorded 30 years old. With Bon's vocal's/lyrics and Young's guitar riffs this album kicks you squarely in the balls.  Songs about humping and drinking are timeless. AC/DC ceratinly isn't a 'greatest hits' kind of band, and the packaging is well done also.
B00005JN0T|1.0|This movie centres on digital effects and considerable noise. There is the ghost of a story here and, like a ghost, appears unexpectedly at times but, again like a ghost, is difficult to see and vanishes quickly. <br /> <br />The movie holds your attention to a degree but in the way a series of explosions do. One goes off, then another then ... there's a pause, and then another. So when they stop you wait for the next one because you know it will happen shortly. <br /> <br />I suppose my biggest problem with the film is the digital look. It is so excessive you want to tear your hair out. The actors look like people lost in a Twilight Zone episode where they've found themselves in a huge video game.  <br /> <br />As for the characters, it's fitting that James Cromwell plays a character who is seen only as a holographic image - something with no depth. This is pretty much what every character is. <br /> <br />It's hard to fault the actors given what they have to work with. In fact, Bridget Moynahan as Susan Calvin is quite good and effective given the little room she has to actually act. But she's about the only one. <br /> <br />For instance, there is the movie's star, Will Smith as Del Spooner . He appears to have phoned in his performance. But to be fair he has to spend the majority of his time being an action figure. But riding motorcycles and jumping from ledges is not acting. As an actor in I, Robot, he's a great stunt man.  <br /> <br />The sad thing about this movie is that there actually are the seeds of a pretty good story here. But they're lost amid cliche's, stereotype characters and the endless, unrelenting \\"set pieces,\\" all digitally created and very boring.
B000089RVR|5.0|This is a great cd. I like it more than the first, which I thought would be impossible. Some of it definitely helps pick the mood up. Some have good beats while others are soft and relaxing. I think Dido is a real winner and her music is really positive overall. If you like softer music with a good rhythm, you should like Dido!
B00064MW6A|1.0|Released in July of 2004, Catwoman was destined to become a box office bomb after receiving slews of terrible reviews.  Nearly every critic in the business blasted Berry, Bratt, and everyone else involved in this lackluster attempt at an action film.  Though their words scratched deeper than any cat claws could, nobody can adequately describe how truly awful this film really is.  <br /> <br />Mousy aspiring artist Patience Phillips (Berry) spends her days creating advertisements for beauty products.  The rulers of this beauty empire, supermodel Sharon Stone and her egomaniacal husband, are callous and cruel to their employees; and big shocker, they're hiding a dark secret.  It seems the new face cream they're hawking causes some major medical issues.  Unwilling to take a hit to the pocketbook, they cover it up.  That is until poor Patience discovers their dirty secret while working late one night.  After being flushed out a drain pipe, she is rescued by a group of felines and is reborn as Catwoman.  What insues is a laughable farce of a movie, featuring bad acting, bad jokes, and poorly-produced special effects.   <br /> <br />Oscar winner Berry rambled on and on at the Academy Awards about how she was paving the way for black actresses in America.  Well, with Catwoman, she paved the way right down the toilet.  While undeniably attractive, she quite simply does a poor job with the role.  Benjamin Bratt seems clueless as the detective tracking Catwoman, and Sharon Stone simply looks bored; as if she showed up just to collect a paycheck.   <br /> <br />The lone highlight of Catwoman is the radio friendly song \\"Scandalous\\" sung by British pop trio Mis-Teeq.  Otherwise, leave this one in the pan with the kitty litter.  One can only hope that the film's dismal performance at the box office will be reason enough not to create a sequel.
055357342X|3.0|Martin's series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" (Books 1 - 3: Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings, and Storm of Swords) is rife with plots and subplots; lavish description; sex; and violent action. He explores the POV of different characters. He also includes numerous clues needed to unravel the various murders and betrayals that occur. These books do require some attention on the reader's part.     He handles plot and motivation better than some other epics I've sampled. However, the character development is uneven. I'm not convinced by Jaime Lannister's partial transformation between Books 1 and 3, nor by the sheer stupidity exhibited by various members of the Stark family. I did find some characters, including Arya, the Hound, Tyrion, and Jon Snow, to be credible. Martin also tends to tell the action, rather than showing it - he relies heavily on giving the reader the equivalent of a voiceover, so they know what the characters are thinking.    Though superior to much of the mass-market fantasy available, this series remains light entertainment. If you want a complicated, bloody, medieval political thriller with multi-dimensional characters, you'll probably enjoy this. If you're looking for high-quality fantasy literature, I'd suggest rereading Gormenghast or The Worm Ouroboros.
0156027321|4.0|THis was a good book.  The author is a good story teller and keeps the audiences attention throughout most of the book.  It took me 3 days to read this which is good time.  I liked it and would recomend it to anyone looking for a good book
B000002VQQ|5.0|I may not know very much music or poetry lingo, but I fully understand the meaning of \\"life-altering.\\"  While writing a term paper on the growth and decline of Rock-and-Roll, I came across the image of a gaunt, dark-haired, wild-eyed woman named Patti Smith.  Thinking nothing of it, I downloaded her first album, Horses (I have since purchased the CD and am on a mad hunt for a vinyl copy).  What came out of the speakers changed my life.  Her poetry is delivered with such passion and determination over the exceptional musicianship of Lenny Kaye and the rest of the crew.  What's contained on this album is definitely more than what the average listener could ever expect.  Between jolly little riffs of mainstream '50s-'60s Rock, there are interspersed stanzas of Smith's poetry dealing with intense lust, suicide, rape, and various other images.  They're not very happy, admittedly, but they're just...so integral to the entire work that the listener does not notice their emotional impact until long after the album has played through (unlike today's 'rock' where the lyrics practically scream \\"I'M GOING TO CUT MY VEINS AND SCREAM YOUR NAME AS THE BLOOD SPURTS FROM MY CHEST AND BLACKS OUT THE NIGHT SKY!\\").  I know I have not done the album enough justice with this little review of mine, but I implore you to at least give the songs a listen or two, and if even the smallest twinge of \\"I like this\\" comes across your mind, purchase this album.  You will be not disappointed.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day's 'Idiot', in my opinion, is the next Rock masterpiece - pure and simple. It is a true diamond in the rough of modern musical ideas. If ever there was an album to show the current generation what real talent and artistry sounds like, it is surely - and finally - <br />American Idiot. It may very well be - and I don't say this lightly - the 'Sgt. Pepper of its time,' or at the very least, rank with the greatest rock albums of all. It is very heartening and affirming to hear such a fresh, vital and grand work in a  <br />landscape of mediocrity. I thank my 17 yr old daughter for buying it, and letting me borrow it (I am 50, and a long time professional musician, and huge Beatles fan) - it has restored my faith in Rock n' Roll.
B00064MW6A|5.0|When this was first released on DVD I thought that it was going to be another tease the men with a scantily dressed woman.  Out of boredom I decided to watch it as I had seen most of the other comic book movies.  To my suprise it is now one of my favorite movies.  The work that they did on cat movement and Halle's work in mimicing them was a treat to watch and it was a rare treat to see an ancient religious belief treated with respect.  I also liked the way the treated the duality of what a woman can be if she chooses and her right to choose.  I have recommended this film to all I know who like me are pagan.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|There is no way on God's green Earth anyone with a brain could give this movie a positive review unless they are being paid to do so.  Even a stupid movie like \\"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\\" could have some redeeming qualities, or a rediculous movie like \\"Airplane!\\" could provide laughs.  But \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" has no value whatsoever except to trick some confused people into thinking that it has some value.  In any case, I am convinced that the creators of this garbage knew exactly what they were doing.  There is a scene where Napolean is watching his uncle's home movie of his uncle posing with a football.  Napolean laments watching it and calls it the worst movie ever made.  I believe that was exactly the intention the producers of \\"Napolean Dynamite\\" were aiming for, and they succeeded.
0679736646|5.0|There is little value in reading a story you don't understand.  To Dick, most people lived their lives in a programmed, mechanical style.  The world he saw around him was one where reality was out of joint.  In this story, UBIC, \\"reality has receded; it's lost its underlying support and it's ebbed back to previous forms.\\"  This story demonstrated Dick's uncanny ability to write outside the box we all call everyday life.  His characters here were forced to act in a state of frozen, half-life.  His half lifers had died but their life force could be somewhat sustained in deep freeze.  To Dick these half lifers represented the programmed, mechanized people who surrounded him and his writing.  They ate him up.  They sucked him dry.  Half lifers are us.  From this notion came his slogan, \\"I'm alive and you are dead.\\" <br /> <br />Just as a can of Ubik, spraying out a negative ion field, was the antidote to complete deadness for Joe Chip, so Dick's imagination was the antidote to the deadness in those who surrounded him in his life.  This story represents his crispest use of metaphor.  As Joe Chip had to solve an elaborate puzzle just to discover he was a half lifer, so the reader must solve a word puzzle to glean the deep meaning of this tale.  Deadness to Dick was an unimaginative life, one lived without passion. <br />
B000062YAZ|3.0|This album is considered by most to be the greatest thrash metal of all time.  This isn't even Slayer's best album (HELL AWAITS is their best).  It's a good album, but not a great one.  First off, it's too short.  The average time length of the songs is two to two-and-a-half minutes.  The best songs are \\"Angel Of Death\\", \\"Post Mortem\\", and \\"Raining Blood\\".  These are the songs that have some meat on their bones.  REIGN IN BLOOD is essentially a hardcore punk album with sick lyrics.    Kerry King needs to stop trying to play guitar solos.  Running two fingers up & down the neck is not what I call a great lead.  Kerry, please let Jeff Hanneman handle all of the lead work.  He's much better at it than you are.  Jeff Hanneman should be the one with the monthly column in Guitar World magazine.  Rick Rubin told Kerry to \\"make a bunch of noise\\" when he played on the Beastie Boys' \\"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\\".  It seems Rubin told Mr. King to do the same thing when it came to his solos on REIGN IN BLOOD.  Jeff Hanneman has some pretty good lead parts on \\"Angel Of Death\\" & \\"Reborn\\".  Jeff has not gotten his due as a guitarist and songwriter.  He's the Jimmy Page of thrash metal.  The songs that he either wrote alone or at least wrote all of the music for are the best ones on the album.     Let's not forget those classic Slayer lyrics.  As the story goes, Columbia Records was interested in putting this album out.  That is, until they read the lyrics to \\"Angel Of Death\\".  Columbia thought the song was pro-Nazi, and they told Slayer to take a walk.  That's why this album came out on a rap label (Def Jam).  The rest of the songs fall in line with typical Slayer themes (Death/Kill/Hell/Satan).  It wasn't until 1988's SOUTH OF HEAVEN - when vocalist/bassist Tom Araya got involved in the songwriting process - that Slayer's lyrics started to get smarter.    If you were going to rate the top ten rock drummers to come along in the past twenty-five years, Dave Lombardo would have to be onthat list.  His playing is outstanding on REIGN IN BLOOD.  Dave's fills are amazingly fast.    I know it sounds like I've been knocking this album here.  Let me just say that I have enjoyed listening to it over the years.  I am a fan of thrash metal.  There are some classic guitar riffs on the album.  The production is very good and the band sounds tight.  Their aggression is virtually unmatched.  Plus Slayer is one of the greatest (if not the greatest) live bands in music history.  However, I also keep REIGN IN BLOOD in perspective.  It is not the greatest thrash metal album of all time.  If you want to get the greatest thrash album of all time, check out Dark Angel's DARKNESS DESCENDS.
0316776963|3.0|I don't know what it was, but through the whole book I couldn't shake the feeling that David Sedaris has no soul.  Perhaps that is unfair; but it is not unfair to say his book is a soulless, vapid, trite, tired collection of essays with lame titles like \\"The Youth in Asia.\\"  Har har.  I feel like every decent joke was something I'd heard or read somewhere else.  No one's suing Sedaris for plagiarism?  Where's the justice?  I gave this three stars mostly because it was such a quick read that there wasn't enough time for me to get annoyed with it.  I think I laughed a couple times.  Not terrible for 272 pages.
B000002MUW|4.0|I must warn you first of all that I have NOT heard this album in its entirety; I am going by the 5 songs that I HAVE heard in their entirety, and the rest I am judging by what I have heard in audioclips that can be found at madonna.com. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I wonder if Madonna smelled easy money when she went from being sexy to being sexual, since Justify My Love was enjoying massive success on the radio and on video.  I am pretty sure that that was one of the things running through her mind when she unleashed her massive sexual bonanza onto the public back in 1992 in the forms of the SEX book, the accompanying album Erotica, and the softcore suspense flick Body of Evidence.  Now artistically and musically, Erotica was an excellent move on Madonna's part, her best in my opinion, but that review will come later.  On the other hand, this sexpalooza turned out to be a major miscalulation commercially; SEX and Erotica were both trashed by critics and fans alike, and to say that Body of Evidence did not go over as well either is a serious understatement.  At this point, Madonna's credibility, artistic integrity, and her entire career were hanging dangerously in the balance.  Yes the Girlie Show concert tour was a whopping success, but it too was laced with negative controversy.  Fans and critics alike were labelling this as the end, and it very nearly was.  Boy were they wrong.  Bedtime Stories came out in 1994 and put a rest to all those doubts.  Madonna was back, clothed, but in a hip, sexy, ghetto-fabulous getup that screamed R&B diva, and the best part is that she made music to match!  Now, about the album . . . <br /> <br />Bedtime Stories is another step in a different direction for Madonna, R&B to be specific, not seen before or seen since on a Madonna.  It is a sexy album, but unlike Erotica, Bedtime Stories gets its sexiness from romance and seductive but innocent charm and beauty.  In other words, Bedtime Stories is a warm, mature, and sensual counterpartto the dark, chilling, and haunting poetry and raw sexuality of Erotica. <br /> <br />Now although I really, really like most of the music that I have heard off of this album, there is a reason that I am giving it four stars instead of five.  The reason is that Bedtime Stories gets carried away with trying to sound mature and credible, with its themes of romance and longing for true love, as well as other smaller themes.  Consequently most of the down-tempo songs can be quite boring and could put you to sleep, like the name of the album suggests.  Also, it feels like the album was just made in the wake of the Erotica album and the critics' backlash to say \\"I've still got it\\", a point which she does proves brilliantly on the album at times, but albums such as Erotica, Like a Prayer, and Ray of Light are superior because they are deeply personal emotional statements in which Madonna is not concerned with proving herself, so consequently she does not hold back emotionally or lyrically with those albums.  Bedtime Stories sounds soulful, but it concentrates on sounding soulful and looking the part of cool and credible rather than truly feeling as soulful as it sounds. <br /> <br />SURVIVAL <br />I have not heard this entire song, but from what I have heard of it I am very impressed.  It really exemplifies R&B with its gently undulating grooves and insistent, but not prominent, throb-throb of the bass.  The song is a reflection by Madonna on the trials and tribulations of being in the music business for as long as she has.  Really bouncy and upbeat, and I am rather curious as to why it was never released as a single. <br /> <br />SECRET <br />As slow-sounding as this song is it is actually one of the more uptempo tracks on the entire album.  Madonna's vocals simply smolder in this song about a woman sharing a devastating secret with her lover.  The simple instrumentation of slinky acoustic guitar, a drumset that really drives percussion home, and the whom-whooom electricguitar twang really capture the all the grittiness in the ghettos of Harlem like it's being sung about in an underground, little-known club in Harlem.  No wonder this was such an enormous hit for her (peaking at #3, no less!)  Also, for the longest time this was my favorite Madonna music video. <br /> <br />I'D RATHER BE YOUR LOVER <br />I have not heard this song all the way through either, but I know for sure that this is probably the most R&B sounding song on the whole album.  The song opens with a funky guitar riff and lone beats on the drums, followed by the introduction of an even funkier bassline.  This bassline is more complex and very prominent, and it just lolls back and forth in a deep, soulful sounding groove, making this the funkiest song on the album.  Madonna's vocals perfectly accentuate the soulful sounding grooves of the bass, but at times she is a little off key and her voice is strained a little, but in the end she pulls off this R&B crossover with a bang.  Apparently a female rapper makes an appearance on this song at some point; I haven't heard this part of it but other people rave about how great it is, so I bet it's great too.  Definitely one of the standout tracks on the album, which makes me wonder why so many do not like this one as much. <br /> <br />DON'T STOP <br />This is the most pop-sounding song on Bedtime Stories, but I think it still has a few R&B sounding aspects to it, such as bouncy midtempo beat and the use of violin sounds and guitar riffs.  The song breaks away from the heavy emotion of the previous tracks and is another addictive \\"get up on the dance floor\\" anthem that Madonna does better than anyone, though this is not in the mold of Vogue and Deeper and Deeper.  Lyrics are not sophisticated, containing lines like la-dee-da-dee, but if you're the kind that listens to music not for what it's saying so much as for how it sounds, then you'll like this one OK.  I do like M's vocals on this one, they fit the song like a glove,despite its somewhat simpering attitude.  Some consider this song to be filler. <br /> <br />INSIDE OF ME <br />The first really down-tempo track on the album.  When you hear the initial breathy gasps/sighs in time with the beat (I really have no idea what to call those breath noises), you might start thinking, oh no, it's Erotica all over again.  Trust me it's not.  Now i have not heard this all the way through, but trust me it's not a sexed-up song.  Quite the opposite in fact, it's about Madonna's mother and she's singing that she'll always be in her.  I don't really like this one that much, the mature adult-contemporary sound of it puts me to sleep. <br /> <br />HUMAN NATURE <br />The tempo picks back up again for this R&B sounding song which became a modest hit, but this time it's not because Madonna wants to dance.  On this song Madonna takes all of the ammo from the mudslinging critics huffy about the Erotica projects, and she flings it right back at them in an expletive-riddled attack and mockery of the hard time they gave her (\\"oops I didn't know I couldn't talk about, sex, I must have been crazy\\", ouch!).  Usually fireback songs backfire (see Lindsay Lohan's \\"Rumours\\"), but Madonna says masterfully that she will not apologize and that if you have a problem, then I don't care, DEAL WITH IT.  Also noteworthy is the way that hard slamming beats are dropped with the revelations that \\"she said something wrong, she didn't know she couldn't speak her mind\\".  This should have been a much bigger hit in the long run, but sadly enough it wasn't.  The accompanying video features Madonna looking her strangest in black-hair cornrows, a leather catsuit and attached stilletos, and occasionally a whip for her Chihuahua's behind, and the video was nominated for a VMA for best choreography in a video. <br /> <br />FORBIDDEN LOVE <br />I love this song, even though it can be sleep-inducing.  This one has a more urban, even jazzy feel with the stark sounds of the saxophone and the soulful organ in the background.  Babyface does background vocals with Madonna on this one, and it would be perfect if it weren't for Babyface's spoken lines being so loud. <br /> <br />LOVE TRIED TO WELCOME ME <br />I have not heard this one all the way through.  I don't even remember what the part I have heard sounds like.  I guess that means that this is one of the slow and boring filler tracks on the album... <br /> <br />SANCTUARY <br />This one has some R&B aspects to it, such as the basic backbeat, but it sounds very strange to me.  The ripping electronica sounds give it a very cold, distant, nightmarish feel, or at least that's what the clip on madonna.com sounds like.  Many people actually like this song, but for me it's extremely hard to get into.  In reality it doesn't fit too well on this album. <br /> <br />BEDTIME STORY <br />If you thought the one before this one sounded like a complete departure, nothing can prepare you for this.  Sanctuary actually ends by leading up into this song, which is completely different from the rest of the album.  This one is strictly techno/electronica sounding.  In the song Madonna makes a case (with extrememly minimal vocals) against all words and launguage and communication, so it's pretty deep, lyrically.  Even though it is out of place on this album, I like this track very much, listening to it is just hypnotic and entrancing. <br /> <br />TAKE A BOW <br />This was the biggest hit off the album and Madonna's biggest hit ever, staying at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks.  Like in Don't Stop, the violin can be heard prominently, but this go round it gives the whole song a sort of oriental sound.  The song is about Madonna and a lover who takes her for granted.  The way it sounds so innocent and sweet when the lover is getting the boot, it just makes it sound all the more heartbreaking, touching, and beautiful.  This one fairly won the 1995 Moonman for Best Female Video on MTV.  Madonna really saved thebest for last with this song. <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Life is normal for Napoleon Dynamite (played by John Heder.) Sure it is filled with downs, and very few ups, but he gets by.  Sure, he is the biggest dweeb this side of the Mississippi (for Easterners that's the other side.) Now, his brother nearly matches him pencil case for pencil case, but overall life is simple, and just a bit annoying for Napoleon.   <br /> <br />This film is filled with at least a few of the traditional high school stereotypes, and overall it is just the same \\"average Joe\\" story. Yet, this film focuses for once more on the nerd, yet without banding them together like in \\"Revenge of the Nerds.\\" Instead, this small band of diversity even incriminates within, for a brief moment.   <br /> <br />I thought this film was ok, but the voice of the main character got on my nerves after the first ten minutes.  Plus, there's nothing really to the characters till the end, and by then it's all a simple wrap-up of the story. I would say the ending was too predictable, if it was not for the fact that there was no \\"story\\" of conflict until the end; everything else in Idaho up to that point was just average.   <br /> <br />I am too a fan of independent style films, but like some reviewers have said it is hard to actually care for the characters.  If you feel like it then buy the film; however, I would just view it once and see if it touches your retro-twanged emotions.
B0006399FS|3.0|I am a long time follower of this band. Despite the enormous hype machine that has followed them everywhere the`ve ever gone, I`ve always believed that they were geniuon about there work. The cracks started to show AFTER the Pop album. Although that album was lambasted by the general public as being out of touch and missing precious hooks, the truth is the band was still trying to `f**k up the mainstream.` <br /> <br />This is the strangest album for me. On one hand it is far better than almost anything out there, yet on the other hand IT IS a complete rehash, unimaginative, and the biggest crime of all, full of subpar lyrics with little depth or meaning.  <br /> <br />I`ve always found Bono to be the most puzzling lyricist and that is what I`ve always loved about him. Sometimes his lyrics are so simple that a 3 year old can understand them and sing along (It`s a beautiful day!!!) yet at the same time have such deep meaning in their simplicity and err, honesty (you`re dangerous because your honest). This album (for the most part) doesn`t seem to have that deep layer to me, at times this might as well be Coldplay (not a compliment). Any album that has the lyric `scent of a newborn baby`s head` regardless of any context looses marks.  <br /> <br />Although we don`t all like to be challenged when we listen to pop music, U2 always have, and now, well, I`m not so sure. The album goes down smooth, the first time I heard it I was excited and full of awe. Now, I`m not. Bono has said before that if the band ever released 2 crap albums in a row they would call it quits. I can`t say the past two albums are crap, but they certainly aren`t up to the majestic heights of before, period. <br /> <br />The music seems phoned in and overproduced. I can barely hear the drums and for a so-called rock album that is a big problem. Bono`s voice is shot, there is no argument. Yes he can still sound good, but after 3 years in the studio of course he`ll sound good. He cannot belt it out anymore. The best song, and probably the most profund to me is a slow, almost tiny song called `One Step Closer.`He doesn`t belt it out, he speak sings, like an even cooler Leonard Cohen. The lyrics are double layered and musically its different from the rest of the album. It sounds great, fresh, different, soulfull, heartfelt and touching. The only problem is that it comes after two shockingly bad songs (A Man and A Woman and Crumbs From Your Table) and it simply reminds me about what I used to love about this band.  <br /> <br />Now this is still U2, and it is still a great album, but not a great U2 album. Vertigo, despite too much production and some realy silly echo effects and lyrics (and the Ipod, another story on it`s own) does rock. `Sometimes You Can`t make it on Your Own` has the most gorgious bridged I`ve head in years, if not ever. `All Because of You` does rock and `Original of the Species` is another fine song. However the rest is filler compaired to U2`s highs You might as well be listning to Holy Joe, Pop fanatics will understand that.  <br /> <br />Finally, I cannot recommend the hardcover edition. Yes it is nice, but there are no lyrics in the booklet. And this leads me to my biggest complaint, Fast Cars. Fast Cars is available only on the hardcover version. It is the best song on the album. It is paranoid, fast, rocking, original and features the best, darkest and deepest lyrics on the album. It`s like cuddly 44 year old Bono reverted to a pissed off version of The Fly channeling David Byrne and Thom Yorke at their most frenzied and parnoid. It`s songs like this I long for, not overproduced sap like City of Blinding Lights created to sell albums, T Shirts and Ipods. <br /> <br />I suppose that I`m being harsh on this album because I miss the old U2, the never sell out earnest young men who I grew up with. This is the very definition of a safe album, an album you can put on at a dinner party and make everybody happy. I still like the new U2, I just missthe messages and deepness the old version had, warts, flops, follies, embarrassments and all. It made them more human. Now they are finally starting to come across as corprate rock. If they don`t change up they may end up like the Rolling Stones, artistically irrelevant, but still huge despite that. Is this how they want to be remembered? <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|So there really isn't a climax or a main plot to this movie. Usually that would bother me, but not in the case of Napoleon Dynamite.  I laughed so hard watching this movie (the dialogue is great.. i.e \\"Go find your grandma\\", \\"I bet you I can throw this football over that mountain\\" \\"Go feed tina eat the food tina\\".  It's one of the funniest I've seen in a while.  The short film included in the extras is pretty funny itself (lottery tickets...)  This movie made me laugh and I would recommend it to anyone with a good sense of humor.
1592400876|5.0|I managed to put off reading Eats Shoots and Leaves for about a year after it appeared in the States and when I finally got around to it I was delighted. Let's face it. Grammar is not a subject one usually associates with humor.  <br /> <br />Lynne Truss looks at the past laws of puncuation, the present sloppy day, and ponders on where we're going. She also, to my delight shows that the old trick of just putting the comma wherever one would naturally pause if speaking out loud isn't such a dumb idea and actually was what the comma was invented for.  <br /> <br />She admits that some things can't be nailed down and are a matter of taste. Some people like the Oxford comma and some don't. Some people love the semi colon and some of us will simply re-work the darn sentence in order to avoid bothering with it. I've happily ignored the semi colon for years and thanks to Eats Shoots and Leaves I can feel justified about it.  <br />And finally, she puts an end to the its/it's conundrum once and for all.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed it.  <br />
B0006IIPIK|1.0|Leaving aside the technical wizardry (for which the film has justly received accolades), Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is at the base, a poor script.  No fault of the actors, all of whom are well known and justly so, but the story fails entirely. <br />     Mt. Conran has visualized an imperfect world, with sufficient holes in his reality to drive several trucks through.  Perhaps because modern science fiction has taken on a realism that did not exist in the \\"Golden Age of Science Fiction,\\" an era which Mr Conran is attempting to re-create.  Early on, when the trailers and TV spots were running, I was excited, hoping for a 30's style of visuals and a script equal to \\"Maltese Falcon\\" or as swashbuckling as \\"The Mark of Zorro.\\"  Instead, we see a stroy that only serves to take us from one improbable situation to another. <br />     I would like to see another attempt at this type of a movie.  The technical challenge still exists.  But a decent story and script, as well as the ability to direct actors to  fine performance are a requirement to justfy this type of expenditure for a studio.   <br />     Perhaps the story is there, and the failing is the direction.  Or perhaps the script does just not support the acting.  In my opinion however, the lacking is in the basic storyline.   The script just does not grasp the imagination of the viewer, and without that grasp, every other error (intentional or not, as the case may be) grows as it is exposed to light.  As in all manners of film making, the story comes first.  Without the story, all we are watching in this case is a technical exercise in matte photography and computer generated images.  Pass on this movie.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend's debut, \\"Get Lifted\\", is a refreshing change of pace from much of today's \\"R&B\\".  Aside from showcasing his amazing voice and unique lyrics, this CD is fantastic because it tells the story of a sort of emotional journey.  The CD tells a story of a man who thinks about getting \\"lifted\\", beautiful women, and cheats on his girlfriend(s).  Eventually, this man meets a woman who makes him want to change his ways and he is now worried about doing right by her and making the relationship work.      It's rare to find a truly gifted artist who has such a well-thought out CD.  John Legend certainly fits the bill with this excellent freshman release.  There isn't a single \\"skip-worthy\\" song on this CD, which is extremely rare.  Every song moves smoothly into the next and there is a very real purpose for every single song being on the album (not just 10+ random songs thrown together to put out a CD).    Here is a breakdown of the tracks (rated 1-10, 1 being low, 10 being high):    Prelude: I wish it wasn't only 44 seconds - this is a truly great way to start off the CD!  It flows very nicely into... (9)    Let's Get Lifted: a smooth chorus - D'Angelo's \\"Brown Sugar\\" was certainly at least a partial inspiration (8)    Used to Love U: Holla Holla Holla!  Great, catchy chorus.  I really like the verses and unique lyrics. (8.5)    Alright: I really like the music behind this song - excellent driving rhythm/beat...lyrics are not the strong point of the song. (7.5)    She Don't Have to Know: It reminds me of Alicia Keys' \\"Mr. Man\\" (one of my favorites off her debut album).  A nicely done song all around (8)    Number One: You can definitely sense the Kanye West vibe in this song.  It's my least favorite song on the CD.  It's very catchy, but it's the weakest song both lyrically & musically.  It doesn't showcase his voice enough for me (7)     I Can Change: Snoop Dogg collabo.  This one is pretty nice.  John's voice has a very nice smoky feel in this song.  Plus we get adifferent side of Snoop in this song! (8)    Ordinary People: My favorite track.  A gorgeous ballad...  beautifully sung, beautifully arranged, beautifully written.  (10)    Stay With You: This one has a nice gospel feel to it.  My third favorite track. (9.5)    Let's Get Lifted Again: Simply beautiful.  The guitar is very cool - very different.  The guitar reminds me of a mandolin with very Asian-sounding chords.  My husband thinks it has a western vibe.  I suppose it works either way!  John's falsetto is just beautiful on this song and he really shows us his range here.  My second favorite song (10)    So High: Another beautiful ballad.  The piano is very nice accompaniment to John's voice here. (8.5)    Refuge: Catchy little tune with a nice happy vibe to it. (7.5)    It Don't Have to Change: another gospel/hymn-inspired tune (with a nice chorus backing him up and taking some verses) about family and 'simple days'.  Great message and this song reminds me of D'Angelo's Higher (my favorite song on Brown Sugar).  A few awkward parts here and there, but overall very nice (8)    Live It Up: This song feels like a late 60s/early 70s Motown up-tempo ballad.  Lyrically different/unique and musically, I really like this one (9)    Overall, this is an excellent CD.  It's rare to find such a wonderful combination of artistry, musicality, and pure talent in one CD.  If I had to find a negative, it would be that I would have liked to hear more of John's range.  He should showcase his gorgeous falsetto more often.    I hope he doesn't make us wait as long as D'Angelo did with his sophomore album because I am definitely looking forward to hearing much more from him.
0671027344|3.0|Before buying any book I always like to look at the reviews of people who have read the book. For this book in particular I found almost no negative reviews and expected the book to be great. When I got it I was so happy to be able to read it, but upon starting it I was letdown. I'm not saying the book doesn't have its good qualities but I just isn't the amazing book everyone says it is. They make it seem to be the next major american classic, and it is far from it. However, I can say one good thing about \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\", it was slightly thought provoking. Not on a high level though, and the thoughts provoked within myself would not be for everyone because they aren't in the same situation. I'm not mad that I read this book because of the few thoughts, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this book to many people I know.
B00005AQF7|2.0|Snoop Dog was everywheres for the past few years..TV, Commerical, movies...you name it, he did it. Probably for the money because he couldnt rap about hos and weed. He is one dimensional, although he has a cool, unmistakable voice. Too bad he wasted his talent. To me he released only two cds worth listening to- Dr. Dre's The Chronic (Why does Dre put his name on cds and its a different artist on mostly every track but a couple, anyone notice that?) and this cd. This cd was praised for the longest time. The raps are good, the beats are so so but its the same old crap over and over. Can he think of anything else to rap about? I know your name is Snoop Dog, you like sex and weed..please tell me more.
B0006IUDXA|3.0|i never saw this show in the eighties, but my brother was a big fan. I started watching the first disc and found it very entertaining, even with the cheesy music, bad acting and worse haircuts. Richard Dean Anderson makes a terifficaly likeable hero and my mom, who also never saw the show in the eighties, instantly fell in love with him. I can see why my buddies back then liked this show so much. like a good mystery show (Murder, She Wrote or Columbo) the fun is in seeing how MacGyver uses everyday objects to create such neat weapons or tools. the video on the first three episodes isn't too bad; i think it's watchable. and while the set doesn't have subtitles, it does have closed captions. very important for my brother who is hearing impaired.
B000084T18|1.0|Alright Ill admit 50 cent can rap; But he's with Eminem! If 50 choose to go a different route then sign with a white boy who is more stale then a box of crackers open for a week. This guy couldnt get a contract or was it about the money? Em cant think of anything so he acts all cool and gobbles up all this bad ass talent, tames them, then the public eats them up and Em makes money off black men. When will someone actully realize what im saying?
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Back in the day, back in the 70's, I was just a kid.  I think I was 10 or maybe 14 when I first heard of Pat Metheny.  My father who has a keen ear for good jazz has been my inspiration and educator.  Thanks dad!  As for Pat's latest effort?  Strength in numbers. I love it when they're together.  I love the complexity of sounds and melodies on this CD.  That's what they're best known for.  That's their signature sound.  I've been a fan since childhood and at the ripe old age of 30 something, I still have an affinity for this group.  Got cash?
B000003B6J|2.0|The first two songs are amazing, the rest of the cd lags. I cant think of what else to write haha
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I am amazed at how many reviewers complain about this movie being boring, or accuse it of being pointless and plotless with \\"nothing happening.\\"  True, there isn't a hugely climactic arc to the film (the somewhat listless ending could be one of its main , small, flaws), but it isn't a static movie by any stretch of the imagination. It has the rhythm of ordinary life, rather than the high-octane career of a car chase. I challenge anyone to isolate a few months' period out of their lives, and try to find the \\"point\\" in it.  There may not be one obvious, but we can agree that plenty happened. <br /> <br />As other reivewers have mentioned, the movie is really one long chuckle, full of both subtle jokes and broad slapstick. I think it appeals to some people the way abstract art, jazz, free verse, and gamelan appeal to some and drive others to distraction. I've heard viewers from semi-high brow types to typical 10th graders rave about the film, suggesting it doesn't hit too many false notes if you aren't expecting it to be a heart-pounder. <br /> <br />Some reviewers claimed that there was no character development, and rather than just a matter of taste, I believe that is simply not an accurate assessment. From Napoleon to Pedro (that smile was like the sun rising) to Deb to Kip to Uncle Rico, all the main characters evolved and changed. There was far more emotional movement in this film than in my current least-favorite film, Mystic River, unless you consider being killed or killing an old friend character development. <br /> <br />I would rate this film between 4 and 4-1/2 stars. I think the directors could use a little more experience, but this is a fantastically entertaining debut, and has a genuine sweetness to it.
B00065DWCW|1.0|Rarely has someone been so famous for so little, and that fact shines through in \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative.\\" While much-publicized pop star Britney Spears has produced four albums thus far, all that becomes clear in her \\"greatest hits\\" is that her music has never been that good, and it's only getting worse.<br /><br />This contains several of her hit singles, arranged in no particular order -- expect to bounce madly between slinky technopop and bouncy bubblegum with no logic in mind -- the obvious hits like \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" (future bondage-porn soundtrack?), \\"... Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops!... I Did It Again\\" are set alongside much lesser pop hits like \\"Toxic,\\" the flaccid Madonna duet, and several others that were more or less forgotten.<br /><br />Like virtually any other greatest hits album, it has some bonus materials. There are from several remixes, none of which are too good -- for example, the Darkchild Remix of \\"Overprotected\\" is a clattery, feedback-laced affair. Spears also releases several previously unheard songs, such as the generic \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" and equally dull \\"Do Somethin'.\\" The most hyped song is \\"My Prerogative,\\" an electropop cover of a Bobby Brown song -- with lyrics like \\"I don't need permission/I make my own decisions,\\" it sounds like an immature, defiant finger-flip at the world. Good luck with that.<br /><br />Usually \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums are put out for one of two reasons. Either a band/singer has been around for eons and has enough glorious songs to fill an entire album, or the label they are/were signed to is trying to cash in. For the latter, think \\"Best of Mandy Moore,\\" which Ms. Moore had nothing to do with. Sadly, Spears' \\"Greatest Hits\\" album is neither -- instead, it feels like an effort to keep her at the forefront of music store displays.<br /><br />Her music is pretty standard for whatever kind of pop is attempted -- polished and overproduced. And, I might add, very predictable -- virtually every blip and note can be detected before it's heard. While \\"Toxic\\" has a halfway decent beat and some electric violins, Spears strikes out with her newer pop melodies, especially the ones that sound a lot like No Doubt covers.<br /><br />Her image also veers wildly through the various songs, starting off with the sound of a giggly teen who has done something naughty. Then she's launching into the more sexual stuff, especially in the horribly-written \\"Outrageous\\" (\\"Outrageous!/My sex drive/Outrageous!/My shopping sprees....\\"). But it doesn't feel genuinely sexy -- rather it feels like a little girl dressing up in mommy's lingerie.<br /><br />And Spears' vocals have never been too good -- her early material displays a voice that is pretty typical for a teenage girl. It has little range, and it's a sort of breathy, thin voice. That doesn't last -- her voice deteriorates over the more recent tracks from her fourth album, becoming drier and more computerized. The sound peaks in \\"My Prerogative,\\" where Spears sounds like a congested robot.<br /><br />Everyone has an opinion on Spears' much-publicized love life, but the quality of her pop music is pretty clear.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|This is a film that looks like the actors were rejects from American idol. But they have one quality and that is they are different. In true Jerry Springer style, you tend to walk away with the feeling that at least my life is not that bad, or I am not that stupid in comparison. This film takes one of our greatest fears of looking stupid or looking bad and makes us laugh at it and somehow feel better. While Napoleon is not totally disfunctional, he sure gives it a run for the money.
B000002BE9|4.0|Fiona Apple has become one of those few singer-songwriters who is known for her talent, with only two albums to her name. Her debut \\"Tidal\\" is more uneven than her sophomore album, but Apple's rich voice and exquisite musicianship make up for the occasional lyrical stumbles.<br /><br />\\"You say love is a hell you cannot bear/And I say gimme mine back and then go there for all I care,\\" Apple sings in the first song, her alto suspended somewhere between a purr and a snarl. Backling her up is her own textured piano playing, backed by a heavy bass lick that pops up every few seconds like a tribal drum.<br /><br />But unworthy lovers aren't the only topic that Apple tackles here. She also explores personal changes (\\"And I suddenly feel like a different person/From the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion\\"), hurting others in love, and \\"You'll say \\"don't fear your dreams\\"/It's easier than it seems.\\"<br /><br />Her songs are painfully deep in themselves, but it's all the more shocking and stunning when you realize that she was only eighteen when the album was released. Her music exudes the sorrow, anger and emotion of a woman twenty years older, mixed in with the ever-changing personality of a young girl. Music like this can't be calculated; it can only ever be real.<br /><br />Her youth does show in songs like \\"Pale Summer,\\" or certain awkward lines like \\"Oh, your love give me a heart contusion/Adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red.\\" It sounds a bit too overblown, in a high-school poetry way. But Apple has a rare way with simpler lines, giving them a verbal punch that a shadowboxer couldn't match. \\"I have never been so insulted in all my life/I could swallow the seas to wash down all this pride!\\" she snarls in the first song.<br /><br />But honestly speaking, Apple could sing some really dreadful songs and they would still sound good -- her voice is another thing that was much older than she was, the sort of thing you'd expect to find in a thirtysomething torch singer. Her husky alto carries the songs with a rare intensity, backed with swelling strings and her delicate piano melodies.<br /><br />There are a few lyrical stumbles in Fiona Apple's debut \\"Tidal,\\" but it's still a pop masterpiece.

B0000AC8LZ|4.0|If they made a live-action \\"Dilbert\\" movie, it might resemble \\"Office Space\\" -- a hysterically funny office film by Mike Judge (of \\"Beavis & Butthead\\" fame). Filled with quirky characters and a hilarious employee rebellion, this is a movie for anyone who ever felt trapped in a soul-destroying job.<br /><br />Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss. His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell the pretty waitress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her. In an effort to relax, he accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under.<br /><br />The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy. He conspires with Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with no one the wiser. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly crazed employee who complains that \\"you took my stapler.\\" This time, Milton is a minor character, but a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech.<br /><br />Judge creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (\\"Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhh...\\"). This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field. And let's not even get into the dialogue (\\"Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day...\\")<br /><br />The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective is immensely entertaining. There's Samir, who can barely restrain his rage at his rotten job. And there's Michael, who has a seething resentment of the same-named singer. Jennifer Aniston does a pretty good job as a love interest for Peter -- a waittress who hates her job as much as he hates his.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" has become something of a deserving cult classic -- funny, strange, and sympathetic to the ants that toil in their cubicles. Make more movies, Mike Judge -- especially if they're as good as \\"Office Space.\\"Samir, who can barely restrain his rage at his rotten job.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Alright, maybe that's a stretch. But, it's still pretty damned good. I first heard Chapter Four on NASCAR 2004, and what attracted me to the song was the \\"I come here to kill you,\\" etc. part. On the game, they had that part messed up into something less violent. I listened to it over and over, trying to figure out what they were saying. Eventually, I noticed that it was some good scheise. I'm not a music scholar, so I can't disect the music like other reviews can, but I think that I am authorized to tell you that this is great stuff. So, I will instead tell you what I think of the songs, whether thou likest it or not. <br /> <br />1. Waking the Fallen - Nice intro to the rest of the CD. The, uh, fore-lyrics and the background screaming blend nicely with the music. I give it a 94/100. <br /> <br />2. Unholy Confessions - I loved the guitar-ish intro to this song. The growling part, I'm not so fond of. I mean, it's good, but his growling voice isn't abso-frickin-lutely great like his singing and scream voices. But I'm not complaining. The best part is probably the crooning, sandwiched betwixt the growling and screaming. 96/100. <br /> <br />3. Chapter Four - Another won'drous intro. The Reverend's drumming is incredible. This song is what got me hooked onto a7x in the first place, as aforementioned. The beginning, where the screaming and crooning blend, is the best part. The only gripe is the miserable lyrics. 95/100. <br /> <br />4. Remenissions - This is more like it. Much better than the screw-up that is Chapter Four (haha). Seriously, this is one of the best songs on the album. \\"Human lives to me seem to unreal...can't see through the fog...\\" That line just sounds amazing, as does the rest of the song. 97/100. I would have made it 98, but for the unveiled attack on atheists (If they didn't have One, how would they act? If we didn't have hope, how would we behave? Would they still feel remorse if they slaughtered innocent beings?) Hey, screw you, a7x. No hard feelings, though. <br /> <br />5. Desecrate Through Reverence - This song didn't agree with me at first. It started out all well and good, and I was thoroughly enjoying it until \\"Don't look my way for help, from the beginning you came to me.\\" At that point, I was at the \\"wtf,WtF?\\" stage. Soon after came \\"We don't want your opinion!\\" which sent a chill down my spine. I mean, what the heck is up with that? It's like nails on a chalkboard with a banshee singing while having her nipples eaten by pirahnas. Sheesh. Other than that, great song. 95/100. <br /> <br />6. Eternal Rest - This is the first not-completely-great song. The first part is kinda lousy. I just didn't like it. After the first, rapid-speech verse comes some good music, then an okay chorus, then some good crooning. The line, \\"and you're the lost mother they're calling\\" sounds like a fairy-tale song. Still sounds good. Achtung, I give it a 91/100. <br /> <br />7. Second Heartbeat - This is a very nice song, everything just clicks. It gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling, yeah. 96/100. <br /> <br />8. Radiant Eclipse - This song is good. It's not great, but it's pretty good. It sort of pales in comparison to the next four. The intro is good, the lyrics are slightly awkward, but it works. Blah, I'm talking like it's bad, but it's not. Good. Good radient eclipse. ::pet pet:: 95/100 <br /> <br />--Thus begins the best four songs on the CD, and that, if you look at the previous scores, is pretty f'ng good.-- <br /> <br />9. I Won't See You Tonight, Part 1 - Nothing short of miraculous. This man can SING, people. No screaming or growling, just good, quality crooning. Listen and love it. You'll have an eargasm. Mournful, woeful, but those are good qualities. 100/100. <br /> <br />10. I Won't See You Tonight, Part 2 -  Tired of mourning and woefull-ing? Probably not, but, just in case, have a dose of screaming. This is just as great as the last one. Crooning and sadness gives way to violent anger. 99/100. <br /> <br />11. Clairvoyant Disease - I love this one. Haunting strings, great lyrics, it hath them all. 99/100. <br /> <br />12. And All Things Will End - I have a suspicion that this is appropriate as the last track, but I'm not QUITE sure why. Anyway, this is some good stuff. \\"Sometimes life is altered, won't turn out right, can't turn out right.\\" This is, of course, one of the Gigantically Big 4, and it's sweet. Listen. Or else. 98/100. <br /> <br />So, that's my untrained, unhumble opinion, and it's shared by many others. There are no filler songs, all are very lengthy, all are worth listening to over and over and OVER again. These are some of the best songs I ever heard. Buy it.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|ND shines with the white hot intensity of a thousand suns. I have enjoyed reading these negative reviews listed here. I think their main problem is not having a laugh track to cue their kneejerk 'others are laughing so it must be funny' depth of insight. Clearly this is a film that you either get or you don't. If you don't, fret not: your local cutout bins are well stocked with Pauly Shore flicks available for purchase by the pound.
B000002KDO|5.0|With this album, recorded with the guitar tuned down to an earth churning C-flat, the Sabs redefined heavy, even by the standards they had set previously. This album has influenced so many people it's difficult to even discuss--meaning, it's not only metal bands that learned from this album. Tons of bands of many different styles have gone back to this. And with reason. <br /> <br />But, what about the album itself? It is thick and heavy, but not always dark. The themes range from drugs (mary jane, in \\"Sweet Leaf\\"), to religion (the--surprise!--pro-Christian \\"After Forever\\"), to the dangers of too much hate and rebellion (\\"Children of the Grave\\", to fantasies of escape (\\"Into the Void\\") and moral despair (\\"Lord of this World\\"), and even evocations of the pangs of loneliness and heartbreak (\\"Solitude\\"). Scattered in between are two short, tuneful, almost Medieval sounding musical interludes. <br /> <br />Musically, the album maintains a very heavy groove, with Iommi's guitar providing heavy, catchy, inventive riffs punctuated by excellent, interesting lead guitar work. Iommi never overplays, and he is one of those players that consistently finds interesting notes. (That's a rare gift--he's tons better than, say, Clapton, who I find to be frequently boring.) Geezer Butler's bass work is stellar throughout, alternately locked into the groove or playing high up on the frets, as on the lone soft song, \\"Solitude\\", which is accompanied by sparse, evocative guitar lines and a haunting vocal from Ozzie, complete with recorders (a primitive flute-like instrument). The drummer, Bill Ward, is not as heavy as Bonham; instead, he wanders in and out of the arrangments, propelling but not really driving them. He adds nuance and swing to the Sabbath style, something which later metal bands dropped. And while that may have worked for them, there is something about Ward's drumming I really, really like--it's just a bashing, energetic good time that always lifts the music out of depression or static-ness; that is, no matter how dark the riffs or the themes, the energy of the drums seems to send out hope... <br /> <br />Some people complain about Ozzie's voice, but his freak intensity, coupled with a certain sensitivity to the harder aspects of life, give him an evocative range that critics typically don't acknowledge. But those of us who have been listening to Sabbath for 20 years or more now do understand, and even if his current stuff doesn't reach the depths this early material did, so what?  <br /> <br />In other words, what are you waiting for? This CD is fantastic--one of the most groundbreaking albums of the time period, and one that holds up over years of repeated listenings. Just because the music is not particularly complex, that doesn't mean that it doesn't have quite a number of layers of complexity and nuance. And feeling. And more. The only proviso is, you might want to get one of the remastered versions--either the imports from Castle or on the big box set. All of those sound a good bit better than this version, which can be a little... wooden. Which is unfortunate for such powerful music.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|This 2002 release of Blondie's \\"Greatest Hits\\" renders all other collections superfluous. It takes the original \\"Best Of\\" and beefs it up by seven tracks. Those include original singles from the debut and \\"Plastic Letters\\" albums, and then stretched to singles from \\"The Hunter\\" and \\"No Exit.\\" While \\"Maria\\" may have been a non-starter here in America, it deservedly went to number 1 overseas. Now, it no longer has to remain a secret song.<br /><br />The remastering sparkles a group that was all about the glitter in their heyday. Blondie was always about flash and glamour, which is what made their best albums (\\"Parallel Lines\\" and \\"Eat To The Beat\\") so charmingly eclectic and their best singles so earth shattering. They were the first \\"new-wave\\" band to score a number one with -- Fer crying out loud -- a disco song, and were the very first band to chart a hit rap song that mashed-up rap and pop. (It was nearly 6 years later that Run-DMC would share video space with the resurgent Aerosmith.) Even the lesser known singles are killer. \\"The Hardest Part\\" has got to be the fiercest Debbie Harry vocal, and the French/English version of \\"Denis\\" is a lost classic.<br /><br />There are way too many singers and bands that should be paying dues to the Blondie fan club. Think Garbage, Madonna and especially No Doubt, who's Gwen Stefani should be listening to this CD before recording another BS solo album. Compare the delightful singles collection from No Doubt to the disc and you'll discover the obvious similarities and the similarly fab ear candy. It just goes to show you that there is no shame in being a pop band, and there is also no reason a pop band can't have a major impact on popular culture. Thanks to this new \\"Greatest Hits\\" from Blondie, you can now join in with those who call the music of Debbie Harry and company a pleasure without using the word \\"guilty\\" as a preface.
B00005JNEW|4.0|For those who lament the dearth of quality football movies, Friday Night Lights should make for some mighty happy pappies out there.  Watching Friday Night Lights isn't quite as enjoyable as watching the Patriots routinely trounce their opposition (for this writer, anyway), but it should keep you riveted to your screen all the same.  Based, as everyone knows by now, on H.G. Bissinger's best-selling book, this movie uses the story of one high school football team's turbulent season to provide sidelong views at a region and culture that may seem like a parallel universe to some: Texas and high-school football, in this case the 1988 Permian High Panthers (aka the Mojo) of Odessa.  Some movies try, with varying degrees of success, to use football as a metaphor for life, but in this one it's a bit different.  Here, football is life, and its meaning is perfectly conveyed in what is easily among the most well-written and brilliantly shot movies of last year.<br /><br />Adapting his cousin's book to the big screen, director Peter Berg has here created a triumph of unapologetic realism that examines the ups and downs of life along with the ups and downs of sports.  Some rather implausible moments in the climatic final game notwithstanding (as has been noted, the writers took some liberties with the facts), for the most part Friday Night Lights smacks of verisimilitude.  Unlike in numerous second-rate fooball movies (this means you, The Replacements and Remember the Titans), you won't find photogenic teams gathered around singing songs like I Will Survive, or Ain't No Mountain High Enough, or one of those faux-inspirational songs that I can't tell apart anymore because they've coalesced into one searing cacophany in my brain.  What you will find is everything associated with football at its highest level, from the cheering masses assembled at the games; to the violent paroxysms of on-field action; to the legions of idiots yammering away on talk radio; to the ludicrous and ever-changing expectations placed on players and coaches.  Of course, in most places you'd only find much of this time and emotion invested in the local NFL or major-college team; here all this hype and pressure surrounds a high-school team composed of players who are still little more than children.<br /><br />Coupled with the drama surrounding the on-field action itself is an unflinching examination of the decidedly blue-collar community in which it takes place, the kind of mid-sized city where a college football scholarship can make virtually a world of difference.  You don't have to watch this movie for long to realize just why football is literally and figuratively nearly the only game in town: In Odessa, there's not much else going on.  Many characters in the movie speak quite openly about the desire to get out; Tim McGraw's revelatory performance as a local-legend-turned-tortured-father is a portent of what can happen to those who don't.  That's why it's such a harrowing moment when the team's star running back suffers a catastrophic knee injury: you don't need to wait for the postscripts at the end of the movie to know this guy doesn't have med school to fall back on.<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton's understated performance as the team's moody, put-upon coach Gary Gaines is doubtless the glue that holds the proceedings together, but the movie benefits all around from some sharply-drawn characters, down-to-Earth dialogue, and pitch-perfect acting.  In addition to Thornton and McGraw, Derek Luke is especially convincing as Boobie, the freakishly gifted back whose veneer of confidence quickly gives way to confusion and fear after his injury.  Ultimately, though, Friday Night Lights is an ensemble picture of the highest order, with every player, coach, and fan, and even the stark Texas scenery itself, assuming a role.  With Thornton in the lead the emoting is largely kept to a minimum, but at the same time the emotional stakes are always obvious.<br /><br />Perhapsjust as importantly, Friday Night Lights is helped along by what is quite probably the single greatest soundtrack in sports movie history, and used in perfect fashion to boot.  The Refused classic New Noise makes a perfect psyche-up anthem for the big game, but nice as it is to see such a criminally neglected band get some exposure in a major-studio release, the real star here is Texas post-rock outfit Explosions in the Sky.  This instrumental group's grandiose, textured compositions only serve to add further nuance and emotional depth to a movie that's got plenty of both already.  And on one final note, whatever you do, I implore you to ignore both the pointless nitpicking and negative comparisons found on this site.  There are people out there negatively comparing this captivating movie to the cliched mediocrity fest that was Remember the Titans?  Please.  This is the real deal.

B00004ZAV3|4.0|At first blush, this CD seems like a kamikaze mission! To think, all their best on ONE CD? Yes, EMI used as their criteria which songs were their \\"Number 1\\" hits. But fans (and newcomers wanting to get to know The Beatles) often see this CD as trying to do the impossible: put out a single CD that represents ALL the awesome hit songs The Beatles ever had. How can you do that? The Beatles simply released so many countless excellent songs and ballads that a single CD is almost doomed to fail as a TRULY representative single CD of their \\"best.\\" It seems that people will say the wrong songs have been chosen, the editing is poor, the sound quality is all wrong, and how could they do this to us?<br /><br />Actually, after all is said and done, this is not a bad CD. In fact, it has sold rather well, demonstrating that fans and newcomers alike want this CD. The CD has topped the charts in 34 countries according to Ananova.com. Perhaps a two CD set might have been a better retrospective; and I think so. Nevertheless, the fact is that they put it out as a single CD and it does the best that probably any single CD could do to at least try to make the grade.<br /><br />I personally agree with the reviewer who writes that the sound quality could be better. Another reviewer writes that the song \\"She Loves You\\" is poorly edited. They both are right. I can't give it five stars after that; but I did give it four stars.<br /><br />The rest of the CD is worth the money itself. This is a great introduction for anyone wanting to get a good sense of what the greatest band ever was all about. I suppose many hard core fans will want to get this also, since even with its flaws this is The Beatles and it's hard to pass up more of your favorite band! I guess if you can make peace with the fact that this CD is not perfect and just enjoy it you'll feel the intense involvement and passion with which the band members worked. Hooray for Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr! I still love them and I always will for their music and their values! We are all richer for their contributions to music!m and I always will for their music and their values! We are all richer for their contributions to music! <br />
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I saw this film not really knowing what to expect but I can tell I did not expect it to be as good as it is. I always think I film worth watching and buying is a film that leaves you with a funny feeling and makes you think 'WOW!!' after you've seen it. This did it for me. I thought the story was superb and it had some intriguing twists aswell as one of the most memorable, sad endings I've seen in a movie for a long time (I'm referring to the directors cut DVD ending, the 'baby' ending as I didn't see the film at the cinema but I saw the two alternate endings on the DVD and they weren't nearly as unforgettable). I thought it has a great look and also a nice score that really added to it.  <br /> <br />I personally couldn't see anything wrong with Ashton Kutchers performance and thought he proved how versatile an actor he is after seeing him only in comedy roles previously. I thought he helped create a character that I ended up really caring about.  <br /> <br />It's true the film isn't perfect as there are a couple of little \\"boring\\" moments that seemed to drag a little but I haven't got anything else bad to say about it.  <br /> <br />All in all, forget what the critics, anti-Ashtons and those who over-analyze too much think, 'The Butterfly Effect' is very under-rated and I would highly recommend to anyone who isn't easily offended and isn't just looking for a nice no-brainer to buy or at least rent this movie. It's a ride that'll make you think and one you won't forget in hurry!!
0694003611|5.0|Many rave about this book, though there are some detractors. Personally, this was the first children's book I have ever read. You see, I didn't grow up being read to. When I was doing my teacher training, we were each asked to read a children's book to the class. So I chose this title. I liked its repeating lines, which were comforting and hypnotic. I liked the surrealness of the cow jumping over the moon. This book is simple and yet irresistible. I have since read many other children's books, but this one still holds a magnetic pull on me. That probably says a lot about me.

B0006419J6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie despite my preconceived notions (OK- anyone who has read my movie reviews at this point has realized by now that my initial impressions are wrong- aren't they all?).  This is not the classic I, Robot story, and the only thing you'll recognize from the original are The Three Laws, but it is mostly a very good story.<br /><br />Will Smith plays cynical, world weary Del Spooner with his \\"funny\\" hat, as opposed to his \\"serious actor\\" hat (seen in Six Degrees of Separation and Ali).  However, shades of the latter manage to seep into his latest character.  From the first scene (which includes a very clever use of Stevie Wonder's \\"Superstition\\"), it's obvious how haunted Smith is, and even knowing the premise, you immediately get the impression that it goes beyond \\"Man or Machine\\".  That's good writing, but it's also good acting.<br /><br />Strip the story of it's ultra-futuristic veneer, and it's the classic story of man vs. the group.  We quickly (and nervously) come to believe that Spooner is the only one who sees the obvious.  Again, it's a credit to the writing and acting that we are surprised when we realize we are wrong.<br /><br />As Spooner tries to solve the mysterious death of Dr. Lanning, the creator of the robots, his view of them is challenged by Sonny, the enigmatic (and possibly unstable) super robot who is verging on android because of his sophisticated emotional responses.  Sonny doesn't fit into the boxes Spooner has assigned to him, and he's intelligent enough to want to figure out why.<br /><br />I like intelligent surprises, and this movie delivered- for the most part.  However, I could see what was foreshadowed by the dream and shower scene immediately, and as soon as I saw Hansel and Gretel, I understood what happened to Dr. Lanning.  While it's fun to guess correctly, it's a big disappointment to be surprised and not care.  I won't give much away when I say that I was surprised by who the villain was because I had zero investment in him/her/it.  That, sadly, is lousy writing (or at least a sign of too many cooks in the kitchen).<br /><br />Overall, I would still say this was two hours well-spent.investment in him/her/it.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril's first CD wasn't my favorite. Just sounded like she was trying to be a bit too punk and it sounded like her record execs gave her no creative freedom. In other words, it was crap. The number 1 hits like Sk8ter Boi and Complicated got old...REAL fast. It was thrown back into my pile of CDs, barely scratched and forgotten in my large collection of various kinds of music.    With the release of \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"My Happy Ending\\", I knew those things had been fixed. Her personality came out in her songs, more \\"girlpower\\" than ever, and it showed in her lyrics, however slightly immature they were. Sure, the lyrics could have been deeper, and the guitars could have been more \\"kick ass\\" but the songs were none the less Lavigne, and catchy. The CD broke the mold of her previous \\"punk rocker\\" image, and went into more of a matured pop/rock artist-admired by thousands of girls over the world.     Half of the people that review her on here probably haven't even listened to the album. Lower ratings are given by angered teens  who call her a \\"poser\\" and say that she changed her image and such because she's fake. Hello? Am I missing something here? Most teenagers go through a phase in trying to discover themselves, Lavigne is entitled to go through that phase. And sure, she did dress \\"punk\\" and outside of concerts and photo shoots of course she dresses normally...It's a PERFORMANCE. She does it to please her fans. Nobody wants to see her scream about how life sucks in a pink Abercrombie T shirt and light blue capri pants. Just because she does that doesn't mean she's fake, and an argument like that isn't justified. When you consider this CD screw the image, the music is what's important.    Most of the songs on this CD are quite different from each other (when considering the musical elements), which differs from the last album, Let Go, and keeps the listener from getting bored quickly. She ends the CD with a Ballad about losing her Grandfather, and also sings a mid-CDballad about individuality (\\"How does it feel/ You're different than me\\"). Nobody's Home is a personal favorite, and overall the CD is very moody. GREAT for bad days or really long trips in the car in which bored children or road rage is involved. ;) I was surprised, my Mother even liked it. Enough to accompany me to the concert in August along with my cousin. Diss the concerts all you want, but at least she sings (Unlike a certain Simpson sister we know) and at least she isn't off key the whole time (Like a certain lead singer of Evanescence or the infamous Hoobastank).    Overall, Lavigne's just out there telling the world how she feels by using music, her choice creative outlet. And she does it quite effectively, with songs many can relate too. I would recommend this CD to anyone-even Lavigne haters (and out of the 4 I know and have told about the CD, 3 have bought it and thorougly enjoyed it, and the 4th burned it but still liked it.)This CD is one of the 5 out of my (around 150) collection, that I know I can pop in and not have to worry about since the whole thing is good. It is DEFINATELY worth the 13 bucks.    Side Note* I don't know if Amazon has an edition (I would check into it) without the curse words but if you do have small children (like my next door neighbor). She doesn't curse all over the place, but there are 2 words that might bother a parent.
0743216458|3.0|I read this book as part of my outside reading requirement in AP U.S. History. The teacher had this book in his classroom bookshelf so I borrowed it to read. I enjoyed the story but I thought it didn't develop the different scenarios to make it exciting. Since it is history, and since the situations are probably inherently exciting without embellishment, the author probably didn't feel the need to dramatize the action. But for me (who doesn't know much about WW2), I didn't understand a lot of what was going on because Ambrose doesn't explain what different things are. A glossary would be nice. Also I didn't really like the way Ambrose just seemed to talk to the soldier named Webster who kept saying how he never volunteered for extra work. Ambrose seems to use Webster as an authority on how things happened. Just because he went to Harvard doesn't make him the sensitive intellectual that Ambrose likes to paint him as. Other than that, good book, but could have used more group pictures or at least more generic pictures to show how parachuters look when they fall from planes. All the quoting of Webster just makes the whole thing less heroic. MAybe they did just do what they had to do, but if that's the case Webster shouldn't be the one judging who is a hero and who is not one.
B0002IU988|3.0|And it's a good thing that it isn't because Creed's of post-grunge and pop had gotten stale almost as soon as their first song played on the radio. I got this album after hearing the song \\"Open Your Eyes\\" on the radio. It completely surprised me because there was an awesome guitar solo in the middle, something that is non-existent in today's music. What's more, the guitarist actually has talent, something else that is severaly lacking in today's music, where it is no longer cool to actually have passion for the instrument that the band member is playing. When was the last time there was incredible guitar or drumming present in a mainstream song? Anyway, the guitarist sounded somewhat like John Petrucci, possibly THE greatest guitarist in any music today. As soon as I got the CD I popped it into my stereo and heard the first song, \\"Find the Real.\\" This is also a heavy song with a powerful riff as well as an outstanding, adrenaline-pumping guitar solo. After this I thought that Alter Bridge may actually join with Velvet Revolver and save rock as we know it, but alas, the rest of the songs (except for \\"Open Your Eyes\\") were poor, half-assed, efforts, which is very disappointing. At least they released their best songs for radio instead of some tailor-made pop song that is supposed to appeal to shallow music fans who buy whatever is popular. This band shows potential, I hope that if they stick together long enough for a second album, that they will realize this and continue on the path suggested by \\"Find the Real.\\"

It has no plot either but you keep watching it.<br /><br />This is not a typical nerd nerdy movie. This guy can defend himself against his uncle.

B0006IINSW|5.0|Variations of a Dream is the ESSENTIAL Thief CD to own. What makes it so unbelievable was that it was recorded in Bruce Soords Living room. The production is perfect. Moody heartfelt vocals,touching lyrics and great musicianship from start to finish. Best track has to be Part Zero. A lovely acoustic intro that bombasts into an almighty electric climax. Great to see it is a mainstay of his live set-list. Run me through has a great rhythmic beat throughout.Other standout tracks are Subside,Vapour Trails,Unspoken and the 16 min. epic Remember us.Pineapple Thief would be the obvious choice as support to Porcupine Tree and Bruce agrees, but for the similarities in names, Steve Wilson thought these guys were taking the mickey.I believe that this double bill will eventually take place as if you are a Pineapple Thief fan, you will like the Tree as well. Common sense prevails here, and the only way that the Thief will get higher exposure and respect is this way. Currently, the only gigs that the Thief do are Prog Rock festivals yet they are not essentially a Prog Band. God, I wish them well-This CD will otherwise remain an UNSPOKEN classic and SUBSIDE
B000001FI7|2.0|Give this record a chance and you'll love it. Guess I jumped the gun or my subwoofer wasn't tuned properly or something--sorry!    Original review:   The singer is lame and every song sounds like it was made with a drum kit that is mixed way (as in too much) out front. In a few words -- boring and dated. There just isn't that much really good pop out there so people have to make a fuss about what they know, I guess. Skip this CD and try something like 'When it Falls' from Zero 7.
B00000K3CR|5.0|... and there's no body swapping in it! <br />  <br />This film has aged really well; the comedy and dialogue is really sharp, the acting is believable and there's never a dull moment. Instead of going over the story, I want to quote what screenwriting legend, Robert McKee wrote about the film which rings true; \\"At the crisis, Josh [Tom Hanks] faces irreconcilable goods; an adult life with a fulfilling career and the woman he loves verus a return to adolescence. He makes the mature choice to have his childhood expressing with fine irony that he at last became 'big'. For he and we sense that the key to maturity is to have had a complete childhood. But becuase life has short-changed so many of us in youth, we live, to one degree or another, in a false sense of maturity. BIG is a very wise film.\\" <br />  <br />Sure the toys have changed and yes, Billy Idol is tied to the soundtrack but the message still remains the same. This should be required viewing for all families.
B00006JK1R|3.0|\\"Men in Black II\\" is by no means a bad movie.  There are plenty of amusing moments in the film, and some creative ideas (such as the entire society living in a bus terminal locker).  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are two of the most watchable actors performing today - they both have versatility, and make their craft look almost effortless.  The main problem with the film is that much of it seems to consist of rejected ideas from the first film - again, some funny ideas, but ones that didn't quite make the original cut.  The cast seems to be just \\"going through the motions\\" for much of the film, and that lack of inspiration seems to extend to the writing, and even some of the \\"creature creation\\" that was done so well in the original film.  \\"Men in Black II\\" is amusing at times, but falls well short of the original.
B00005JKNC|2.0|Jim Carrey attempts once again to prove to people he can act after the success of his previous starring role in The Truman Show. The script falls flat as soon as you hear the voice over and makes you go \\"Uh oh, a film about films.\\" It soon reverts to a montage of people telling us why cinema is 'magical' mixed in with a love story and some communist subtexts in there which seem dull and uninteresting and sort of shows the script is desperatly trying to tell a story of some sort of importance while Frank Darabont's films just keeping getting worse and worse. (Can't wait for Farhenheit 451, Frank!) Good preformances from Carrey and Martin Landau but you'd be better off giving this one a miss.
0767802624|5.0|Mixing Science Fiction with comedy is a risky proposition, unless the film in question is a sendup of Sci-Fi films (I still can't decide if \\"Mars Attacks\\" was worth the matinee price I paid to see it almost a decade ago).  \\"Men in Black\\", however, is a near perfect blend of Science Fiction and comedy.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are two of the most watchable actors out there, and the pairing of the two in this film is ingenious.  The supporting cast,from Linda Fiorentino to Tony Shaloub, is top notch.  The special effects, from the dragonfly flight during the opening credits to the spaceship crash near the finale are excellent.  The writing is also much more clever than one might expect from a Sci-Fi picture - the film has to be viewed several times to catch all the barbs and asides Smith and Lee throw at each other.  All in all, one of the most entertaining Sci-Fi films to come along in quite a while.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|I've seen the other films by Charlie Kaufman and have been thouroughly impressed by both of them. Both Adaptation and Being John Malkovich got a lot of hype and praise at the theater. For some reason this one slipped by quietly without drawing much attention. I say this because I feel like this is by far his best film.  For me it was a prime example of art taking on it's own life. It is a love story that is both sad and beautiful at the same time. Most of the plot invovles a world of memories and the processis of the higher psyche. I personally, have never seen a film that I felt was so in tune with human feelings and the subconcious. Somehow Charlie Kaufman captures those private feelings and experiences that you have and hold inside of you during a relationship and puts them on a screen in a way that is both touching and sad. Hands down one of the most remarkable scripts I've ever seen. Also, I feel like I have to write a blurb about Jim Carrery because in this particular film he really won me over. I have to admit I'm not what  you'd call a Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler guy. I don't know why but their films do more to annoy me than entertain. I will say this though he proved to me in this film that he is a damn fine actor and the character he played was both very convincing and incredibley likeable.
0385510438|5.0|After several page turners but not exactly mind blowing best sellers, Grisham's \\"The Last Juror\\" is one of his best books yet.  He returns to Clanton, Mississippi and to his roots in person and as a writer. The plot is interesting and the character development superb.  A great read.
B00005JN4O|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  Finding Neverland brings the best out of Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet.  This is one of those movies that at times made me laugh, and towards the end made me cry.  I truly believe that this movie and its actor are oscar worthy.  I can't wait to see it again - and i deffinately recomend it to anyone and everyone!
B0006M4SO6|4.0|ORIGINAL REVIEW, 1/30/05: I own six Metheny solo or PMG albums stretching from the near-beginning (American Garage) to this one.  I have listened to the album twice and concur with the reviewer that thinks 10 listens are necessary -- I picked up much more on the second listen and can start to identify impressive depth.    I don't give five stars unless a CD grabs me emotionally as well as structurally.  If 4.5 were a grade, I'd give it for The Way Up.    Structurally: Any PMG album gets 5 stars for musical construction, and I am impressed but not surprised that they can sustain a reasonably coherent thought for more than an hour.  My \\"not getting it\\" the first time was a matter of length, not because the cohesion doesn't exist.    Emotions: 4 stars, and even that is commendable.  What struck me were the melodies.  Yes, they exist (one of which sounds like part of a vocal line from an early section of Gabriel Faure's Requiem, curiously).  But what separates the melodies from the ones on \\"Still Life Talking\\", \\"Letter From Home\\" and \\"Secret Story\\", my favorite Metheny works, is the realization that I'm not going to be humming the recurring themes of this work all day long.  Thus my catharsis: I finally realized how much I've appreciated Pat's melodies within the broad musical canvas he paints, and the ones here left me longing for something just a bit.  I also thought the last six minutes were anticlimactic -- I wasn't expecting a Minuano ending, but something louder and more finite would have served the work better.    But that's a quibble.  And any Metheny work (except maybe Zero Tolerance) is a must-listen.  The Way Up is a great work and I highly recommend it, but I'd recommend the three CDs I just mentioned even more.    UPDATE, 5/15/05:  I wrote the above text over three months ago and stand by it completely.  But having listened to \\"The Way Up\\" more than a dozen times since and seeing it live, I wanted to add one more comment.  This CD is even more important asa learning tool than as a casual listening experience.  While the other three CDs I mentioned are the kind I'd take to the beach to relax, \\"The Way Up\\" is an outstanding tutorial for musicians/composers in stretching the boundaries of rhythm, melody and harmonic structure while still paying significant respect to the fundamentals of music theory and sustaining a cohesive thought from start to finish.  That may prove to be its most lasting impact.
B00005NB8K|5.0|If you love The Doors, you need to watch this film. It's absolutely amazing. Full of many songs from The Doors and other bands of the era, it paints a picture of the band from the very beginning until Morrison's death. Val Kilmer gives an outstanding performance and slips into the role of Jim Morrison with no problems. You're tempted to think it IS Morrison. Meg Ryan is wonderful as Pamela Morrison. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie if you are a fan of The Doors. I can't get enough of it.
0393317552|3.0|I am recommending this book; however, I found it quite the chore to get through. <br /> <br />The premise of the book is a 400-page walk through human history to try to determine factors that led to some cultures dominating others, rather than the reverse, for example, the Europeans decimating the Native Americans rather than Native Americans traveling to Europe and dominating those people.  The proximate causes are easy to see, but the ultimate causes are the subject of this book. <br /> <br />The author looks at many factors in all parts of the world:  food production (why it was developed in some places and not in others), aggregation of populations, centralization of governments, development of technology, and so forth.  His basic thesis is that development in the cultures of the world was subject to the various climatic, geographical, and ecological properties of the places they lived.  He expands on this thesis and provides many compelling examples. <br /> <br />And then he beats all his points to death, using many examples over and over and over and over again.  He repeats statements he made earlier, not as a review, but as though he were writing them for the first time.  He condescends to us readers (for example, feeling like he has to tell us that honeybees give honey and silkworms silk).  And he has made some sloppy errors (having carbon-14 decay to nitrogen-14 and carbon-12 in the same paragraph; mixing up aardwolves and aardvarks).  His writing style is often clunky and stilted. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I fought my way through the book to the end.  And despite the obstacles thrown in my path to Page 420-something, I found the experience very interesting.  Because the events he talks about happened in the distant past, it's hard to know whether he's right or not, but he does make a compelling argument for these physical factors making the difference in the development of different cultures. <br /> <br />So if you decide to read this book, skim when you get bored, but try to read it to the end.
B000086EOB|5.0|One of the few 80's Metal albums where every song is good - this album brings back memories! Even the non singles off this album are good. If you like 80's hair metal, you need to have this album.
B000002ACR|3.0|The highlight of this album is the debut appearance of future BYRDS guitarist CLARENCE WHITE on CHRIS HILLMAN'S TIME BETWEEN and THE GIRL WITH NO NAME, which happen to be my favorite songs from this album.  His country string-bending playing style on his FENDER TELECASTER that would later become the next traditional sound for the future BYRDS albums keeps the music on these two songs in motion.  Meanwhile, SO YOU WANT TO BY A ROCK 'N' ROLL STAR is an excellent beginner with ROGER'S 12-string guitar riffs and the horn section, and DAVID'S EVERYBODY'S BEEN BURNED, my other favorite song from this album that has very quiet and easy going melody, is an outstanding ballad that is next to his TRIAD, which was unfortunately left off their next album THE NOTORIOUS BYRD BROTHERS.  Both versions of MY BACK PAGES are great; the album version has a excellent and clean sounding guitar solo, while the other version has an excellent leslie guitar solo and excellent organ riffs in the background.  This version of OLD JOHN ROBERTSON sounds the same as the version on their next album.  IT HAPPENS EACH DAY is a excellent song by DAVID with a acoustic guitar solo (sounds like a MARTIN guitar), but his face-faced LADY FRIEND is more exciting to listen to  with the horn section solo.  The fast-paced DON'T MAKE WAVES is another one of my favorites that should have never been left off this album, along with both of DAVID'S songs that I just mentioned.  However, I am not thrilled with the remainder of this album, especially this version of WHY.

Ironically, this is the first song on the album.  <br /> <br />Add to that, the fact that the book that comes with the album looks alarmingly like \\"OK Computer\\", \\"Kid A\\" and \\"The Bends\\" artwork and it leaves you feeling that a band who were once the best in the world are struggling for new ideas and just felt honoured to release an album to keep the punters happy.  <br /> <br />One swallow doesn't make a summer and jingly-jangly guitars doesn't make a U2 album.

B000001EAQ|5.0|Discotheque - This is one of the most amazing U2 songs ever. The guitar riffs, dance rhythms and vocals are brilliantly mixed together. The song was also a No.1 hit. (10) <br /> <br />Do you feel loved - Some amazing electronic effects and a dance beat are mixed with an Even Better Than The Real Thing-esque guitar riff. Brilliant! (9) <br /> <br />Mofo - This track contains the best rhythms that U2 have ever produced. The electronic effects are direct and irresistibly catchy over the complex dance rhythms. (10) <br /> <br />If God Will Send His Angels - This is definitely the U2 of old mixed with some modern production techniques. The Edge uses some guitar riffs that make this track sound like it could fit on to Achtung Baby. The simplicity makes this sound like the One of this album. (9) <br /> <br />Staring At The Sun - The best track on the album. Once again this is the U2 of old mixed with modern production. The acoustic/electric mix of guitars is gorgeous and the tune is brooding and reflective. (10) <br /> <br />Last Night On Earth - This is the rockiest song on the album and once again like the U2 of old with its soaring guitars. (10) <br /> <br />Gone - This song exhibits U2's gift to write a gorgeous melody. The synths are beautifully layered when the chorus begins. The melody is gorgeous while the vocals are soaring. (10) <br /> <br />Miami - GREAT ONE. It is too experimental with dance textures and rhythms and as a result the melody does not develop. (8) <br /> <br />The Playboy Mansion - The only true lowpoint of the album. This is the blues of Rattle and Hum-era U2 being mixed with modern production. (7) <br /> <br />If You Wear That Velvet Dress - Elegantly produced with a nice melody. Creates a Brian Eno-style mysterious ambience. I do prefer the live version for the lead guitar though as it gives it a more immediate melody (8) <br /> <br />Please - Very bleak and dark. This is the Acrobat of this album with its raw guitars. The dance textures add tothe atmosphere. Best political song since Sunday Bloody Sunday (10) <br /> <br />Wake Up Dead Men - Brings the album to a brilliant climax. The Achtung Baby style rawness of the guitars and Bono's voice heightens the emotion. It's a blinder. (10) <br /> <br />THIS ALBUM BLOW AWAY BOTH ATYCLB AND HTDAAB. IT'S SO DIFFERENT !!!. TRULY RECOMENDED. <br /> <br />

B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a very nice romantic film, it has just the right proportion of laughter and seriousness. And for this kind of movie it is surprisingly serious without being really sad. It indeed shows love in its various dimensions and kinds, far cry from silly \\"and they lived happily ever after\\" seen so much in romantic comedies.     And it does so with great acting by top notch actors. Hugh Grant being cast as the British Prime Minister is one of my favorites, I think he fits the role perfectly with all the subtle allusions to the cabinet current at the time the movie was shot. I also love Alan Rickman's performance and his characteristic way of speaking. Emma Thompson is also great playing his wife, her acting skills especially admirable in the scenes where she conveys deep feelings without saying a thing.    Also some of the less known actors make great performance, like Abdul Silas playing Tony, the down-to-earth friend of the guy who went to Wisconsin looking for love (BTW Richard Curtis surely did not see Dogma beforehand). It turns out it was Abdul's first movie.    I really like to watch \\"Love Actually\\" to lift my spirits a bit. Not necessarily around Christmas. And I would recommend it to anyone - both couples (it can be a very nice part of a romantic evening at home) and singles.

B0002KVUKM|4.0|My wacky title for this review of the 2004 film \\"Van Helsing\\" is probably the most accurate way to describe this parody of both horror and James Bond films set in late nineteenth century Transylvania.  Written and directed by Stephen Sommers, it is no wonder that \\"Van Helsing\\" often felt more like a comedy & parody than a serious horror film since Sommers' earlier big-screen works include \\"The Mummy\\" (1999), \\"The Mummy Returns\\" (2001) and \\"The Scorpion King\\" (2002: which he wrote, but did not direct).  Like most 007 films, \\"Van Helsing\\" opens with the film's hero, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), battling a poorly rendered CGI giant of Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane) at Notre Dame in Paris.  Upon defeating the giant, Van Helsing travels to a secret good-guy headquarters that is under the authority of a Catholic cardinal, Cardinal Jinette (Alun Armstrong), who is the film's equivalent to 007's boss known as \\"M\\".  After being scolded for killing Hyde instead of capturing him, Van Helsing is provided with new state-of-the-art, nineteenth-century paranormal spy-gear from a friar named Carl (David Wenham), who is the film's equivalent to 007's gadget supplier known as \\"Q\\", after being ordered to battle Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and his wives who are terrorizing the last two members of the Valerious family: Anna (Kate Beckinsale) and her brother Velkan (Will Kemp).  If you haven't yet seen the film, you may be asking yourself, \\"How does Frankenstein fit into all this?\\" It seems that in order for Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West) to obtain the much-needed revenue to create his famous monster (Shuler Hensley), he has been aided by Count Dracula, who has a nefarious planned use for the monster.  When Dr. Frankenstein learns of this, he tries to stop Dracula, but is easily defeated since his assistant Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) is already in league with Dracula.  Though thought to have been killed in a fire at the beginning of the film, Frankenstein's monster survives and eventually meets Van Helsing after he helps Anna and her village defeat an attack from Dracula's CGI-rendered wives.  Confused yet?  It gets better!  Not only does Count Dracula have his three wives (played by Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran) to help him, he also has his personal army of gas-mask-wearing oompa-loompas, which, unlike their 1971 \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" equivalents, don't sing any catchy tunes.  If this doesn't sound a bit over-the-top, let's not also forget the flying vampire babies that are highly reminiscent of the Cornish pixies from the 2002 film version of \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" or the flying monkeys from the 1939 \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". <br /> <br />Though you now may be thinking that this is a terrible film, in a strictly horror-genre sense, it is; but in a comedic parody sense, it's rather creative.  Granted, not all of the CGI effects were great, but the overall story and characters are entertaining.  Not surprisingly, the film only earned about a third of its estimated $160-million budget during its 2004 theatrical release because previews for the film had given the impression that \\"Van Helsing\\" was going to be a serious horror film, which left many theater-going patrons a sour experience upon seeing the film.  However, watching the film on DVD (at least from a rental perspective) is far cheaper and a more relaxing home-environment may allow some viewers the ability to see the film as a comedic parody.  I will say that the film's ending was a bit of a surprise that improved my overall opinion of it. My rating of the 2004 \\"Van Helsing\\" is, therefore, 3.5 out of 5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.  Though the film could have relied less heavily upon CGI and been a bit more frightening, it is still entertaining when taken less seriously and with a greater sense of humor.
B000002JR8|5.0|You cannot argue about which CD tends to be the most brutal and released in 1994. It's Pantera's \\"Far Beyond Driven\\", their platinum 3rd album. \\"I'm Broken\\" is a solid favorite, and the music video makes it sound even more brutal. \\"5 Minutes Alone\\" is a great ear bleeding track also. \\"Becoming\\" is one of my favorites. Dimebag could wail on that guitar like no other! \\"Planet Caravan\\" is the perfect closer, as it shows that Pantera isn't just Dimebag, Vinnie, Rex and Phil at their most brutal moments.<br /><br />R.I.P. \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell Lance Abbott<br /><br />1966-2004
B0002X314C|5.0|Although his surname may be something he picked up from an old friend in Chicago, John Legend's debut album \\"Get Lifted\\" proves a definite validation in the making. A gifted singer, songwriter and pianist, he has already gotten his hands dirty as a session player and songwriter for the likes of Janet Jackson, Alicia Keys and Twista. He even played piano on Lauryn Hill's 1999 Top 40 hit \\"Everything Is Everything\\" when he was still a teenager, and his work on Kayne West's debut album \\"College Dropout\\" that helped yield sizzling success last year led West to produce \\"Get Lifted.\\"<br /><br />Although criticism that he has relied too much on his influences to guide his musical direction is semi-justified, Legend (real name John Stevens) has more than enough talent and charisma at his disposal that one listen to the album will leave no doubt in the minds of listeners that he is something special. With his sparkling strokes on the keys of his piano and his singing expressive and powerful, \\"Get Lifted\\" will make some think that Alicia Keys' male counterpart has arrived on the scene. It is appropriate, then, that she utilized his talents on her \\"Diary of Alicia Keys\\" album and has him to support her on her forthcoming tour.<br /><br />Although the initial single \\"Used to Love U\\" was the most obvious song for radio play, it is a mere taste of what the album has to offer. Current single \\"Ordinary People,\\" which is currently ascending the Hot 100, is full-fledged musical rapture, infused with crystalline passion and grace. Anyone who has heard this song and is not smart enough to appreciate the talent behind it will not like the rest of the LP either.<br /><br />A particular highlight comes when he waxes romanticism on the radio-ready \\"Refuge (When It's Cold Outside)\\":<br /><br />\\"When it's cold outside/There's no need to worry cuz/I'm so warm inside/You give me peace/When the storm's outside/Cuz we're in love I know/It'll be alright.\\"<br /><br />The sunny, smile-inducing \\"Number One\\" which features a wonderfully exuberant rap by West is an absolute delight:<br /><br />\\"You know that I love you/There's no one above you/I said it the last time/But this is the last time/Don't make me over/Cuz I can be faithful/Baby you're my number one.\\"<br /><br />Other highlights include the infectious \\"I Can Change\\" featuring Snoop Dogg, the soul-searching \\"So High\\" and the closing \\"Live It Up\\" where his awesome interpretation of his lyrics combined with colorful production and vinyl crackles brings his disc to a regretful conclusion.<br /><br />John Legend has crafted an album that is pure candy to the ears and spotlights a wealth of talent that is truly all his own. If there is any artist out there worthy of all the hype surrounding them, he is the one. Expect great things from him for a long time to come.inducing \\"Number One\\" which features a wonderfully exuberant rap by West is an absolute delight:  <br /> <br />\\"You know that I love you/There's no one above you/I said it the last time/But this is the last time/Don't make me over/Cuz I can be faithful/Baby you're my number one.\\"  <br /> <br />Other highlights include the infectious \\"I Can Change\\" featuring Snoop Dogg, the soul-searching \\"So High\\" and the closing \\"Live It Up\\" where his awesome interpretation of his lyrics combined with colorful production and vinyl crackles brings his disc to a regretful conclusion.  <br /> <br />John Legend has crafted an album that is pure candy to the ears and spotlights a wealth of talent that is truly all his own.

B00008QSA5|4.0|A trick some out-of-work artists used back in the '60s was to team up and record a session and come up with some name for the effort, calling themselves some sort of \\"supergroup\\" in doing so. As far as that goes, this one was not much different. Chicago blues guitarist Mike Bloomfield had just left the Electric Flag and keyboardist Al Kooper had just left Blood Sweat and Tears. The little-known Kooper has been around the music scene as much as anybody has, involved in sessions or production for everybody from Bob Dylan to Lynyrd Skynyrd and Bloomfield was noted as one of the finest blues guitarists around. They knew each other as they had both worked with Dylan on \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", and they saw an opportunity in 1968 to record together. <br /> <br />Unlike some of the pretenders, though, this one is the real deal. The opening cut is a pure exercise in raw blues guitar as Bloomfield goes all out in \\"Albert's Shuffle\\", aided ably by Kooper's organ, Barry Goldberg's electric piano, Harvey Brook's bass and Eddie Hoh's drums. Kooper, who is known as a master producer, decided the track needed horns, so he overdubbed them into the recording for release. On the CD, a bonus track plays the original recording of \\"Albert's Shuffle\\" without the horns. You decide which version is better; I like the horns myself. <br /> <br />Bloomfield continues with Howard Tate's \\"Stop\\", another instrumental that segues well with \\"Albert's Shuffle\\". The third track is a cover of Curtis Mayfield's \\"Man's Temptation\\" that sounds more like Blood Sweat & Tears than the previous two tracks with horns dominating this cut, not Bloomfield's guitar. Al Kooper is not a particularly good singer, so this track is a little weak. The record rebounds a bit with \\"His Holy Modal Majesty\\", where Kooper plays a kind of electric organ called an ondioline and a long instrumental jam is featured. Bloomfield's contribution ends with \\"Really\\", another good blues-tinged instrumental. <br /> <br />Bloomfield struggled with insomnia and heroin addiction and after this side was recorded (taking about nine hours); he decided he had enough and left the studio. Kooper needed someone to replace him and got ahold of a very young Stephen Stills, who up to that point had been mostly known for his work with the Buffalo Springfield. Stills added a variety of guitar styles to the original record's Side 2, with no blues to be found. <br /> <br />Still's first work is seen on their cover of Dylan's \\"It Takes A Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\", my favorite track on the album, a countryish effort. Next is their cover of Donovan Leitch's \\"Season of the Witch\\", he goes into wah-wah mode with his guitar. Like \\"Albert's Shuffle\\", Kooper added horns later; you can hear both versions as the hornless edition is a bonus track on the CD. The next track is \\"You Don't Love Me\\", where the guitar is distorted. The original record ends with the throw-in \\"Harvey's Tune\\", supposedly a bone thrown to their bassist Harvey Brooks and kind of a strange New-Age type track. You thus get a wide range of music on the original Side 2 (Stills' work and Tracks 6-9 on the CD) which may not work for some, but does highlight the talents of Kooper and the other musicians. <br /> <br />The four bonus tracks include the two previously mentioned without horns, \\"Blues for Nothing\\" in which Bloomfield is back in his best blues-guitar mode and the previously unreleased \\"Fat Grey Cloud\\", recorded live at the Fillmore West. <br /> <br />All in all, a solid, if somewhat disjointed, effort. Recommended for Kooper fans and blues fans of any kind.
B00007FOMP|5.0|I really believe that Marvin Gaye was speaking to the Black community when he co-wrote the songs and released the album. The music and the messages are timeless; the issues that he addresses on this album are clearly as important and prevalent today as they were 34 years ago. <br /> <br />Therefore, I believe everyone should listen to the album but I also think every Black man should have a copy of the album just to remind us how far we've come and how far we still have to go. <br /> <br />February marks Black History Month here in Canada. This is one of the best ways to celebrate our Black heritage and the obstacles we have overcome...take a listen to songs like What's Going On, What's Happening Brother, Inner City Blues (Makes Me Wanna Holler), Mercy Mercy Me, Right On and my all-time favourite, God Is Love. <br /> <br />The album is realistic and paints a true picture of what we face in society but also has several inspirational moments. I like to listen to the CD on my way home from a busy day at work. It reminds me of how fortunate I am to have what I have and to acknowledge my blessings when others have not been as fortunate. Peace..
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon, in an awkward way, evokes laughter. The stupid movie is SO stupid. You can't imagine the stupidity. Insanely stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. A lot of the humor of this movie is stupidly rediculous, but effective... and stupid. On the other hand, it's smart. The movie does a hard thing: character humor. Besides, if a movie about a HUGE nerd isn't stupid, it wasn't done right. I hope you watch this and laugh hysterically, like others have. If nothing else, you won't ever forget this movie. It's original smart AND stupid, all at the same time. I think it's great that our society has progressed to the point where we can FINALLY laugh at huge nerds. I recommend it.
B0000541AM|5.0|Especially noteworthy was the constant dialogue and interaction between the characters which brought you into the movie to experience the full effect. Beyond the legendary score and choreography, what was moving for me was the constant development and growth of the characters as they move from one territory to another, learning from each experience. As they encounter different obstacles, you get a feel for each characters style and mode. Like a good western, in order to really appreciate the movie you have to go along with some of its unrealistic, although very dramatic aspects, like gangs on roller skates and bat carrying gangs in uniform. Some of the lines and hair styles which might have been appropriate and the latest fashion at the time immediately date the movie, which easily could have been tempered.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|Ropy, <br /> <br />What are you talking about when you say James is a better guitarist than Kirk? Why don't you learn about music and find out the difference between a LEAD guitar and a RHYTHM guitar. You have no idea what you are are talking about, which is why they should omit your one star rating. <br /> <br />The only thing you are remotely right about is getting rid of Bob, but we all know that isn't going to happen.
B000002J03|4.0|Yes, it is true that Led Zeppelin had some songs here that were just downright plagiarized material. Most notably the songs \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" (taken from Willie Dixon song called \\"You Need Love\\"), \\"The Lemon Song\\" (taken from a Howlin' Wolf song called \\"Killing Floor\\"), \\"Moby Dick\\" (taken from Sleepy John Estes' \\"The Girl I Love\\") and \\"Bring It On Home\\" (taken from a Sonny Boy Williamson song of the same name). Led Zeppelin didn't bother to give those blues artists credit and decided to make it seem like their own compositions. Unfortunately, these actions landed the band in court opposite Willie Dixon and in another by Howlin' Wolf's publisher (as well as Anne Berdon with the song \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\\" in Led Zepp's debut). Yeah, they didn't get away with it, but (according to some), this isn't the end of Led Zepp stealing riffs and/or songs...    Anywho, I know you've all heard this stuff before. Few of you may continuously hold a grudge against this band forever. Most of you do know this, but can safely overlook this fact (look at all the five star reviews). Indeed, Led Zeppelin are damn fine talented. Just hear Plant's screaming and soothing voice. What more can be said about Page? Truly a talented guitarist. Bonzo's famous solo in \\"Moby Dick\\" is the album's major highlight. And John Paul Jones' heavy and bluesy bass. These guys basically laid the ground work for heavy metal. From this moment you hear the first track, you'll know what I mean. It is this album that established Led Zeppelin as one of the biggest rock bands around.    Just recorded a few months after their debut was released, Led Zepp comes back harder than ever before. But the fact that it was recorded shortly after their debut release, as well as the band not having been in the studio, kinda hurts the quality of the album. Yes, it's heavy sounding, but I feel that it was weak and underdeveloped. Not coming up with much new material also might've resulted in them stealing other people's work.    But how is this album so influential with some heavy metal artists? Page's screeching and loud guitar, Bonzo's solo, Jones' bluesy bass (the riffs each member showcased). And the lyrics, which at times have some rather... \\"sexual\\" suggestive material (\\"The Lemon Song\\").    My rating of this album was a bit hard to choose. \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" had a major influence and an important role to bringing birth to heavy metal. This would be an automatic 5 star rating, but weak, rushed and underdeveloped material kinda hurts the value of this album. And I'm still a bit uneasy about the plagiarism, which also hurts the album, but mostly everyone already knows this debacle, and they paid the price for their actions (you know they couldn't have gotten away with this for long). I was caught between three and four stars... but no one can deny how influential this album (and band) was for heavy metal. This really saves the album from getting a mediocre three stars from this reviewer.    Four stars is good enough.

B0006IIPIK|5.0|One of the things I remember hearing about this movie before I saw it in the theaters was that it was all done with actors working in front of a blue screen. That little fact never really sunk in the entire time I was watching the film, not until I watched the \\"making of\\" documentary on the DVD. And now, I believe this is one of one of the most revolutionary, amazing films made.<br /><br />Sky Captain is a throw back to old adventure films of the 30's, a confident hero with a jaded past, a perfect reporter dying to get the scoop, a gum-popping best friend with a penchant for inventions, and a one-eyed general who's a tough dame. Set in New York City around the end of the 1930's, it's equally recognizable and not. A passenger blimp docks at the Empire State with a mysterious doctor on board, who summons Polly to a meeting at Radio City during a showing of the Wizard of Oz. She starts the mystery, only to be interrupted by flying machines attacking the Big Apple, which brings in our hero, and the adventure starts.<br /><br />There isn't a wasted moment or scene in this entire film. Trading character development for plot movement, the story treks along at breakneck speed, spinning a great yarn in the process. The acting, done in front of that blue screen, is phenomenal. Both Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow pull off the impossible, making us believe they are seeing what we are. Angelina Jolie plays her spoiler part well, offering a sultriness to a somewhat stern character. Another unsung actor hero is Giovanni Ribisi, playing best friend Dex, who truly embodies the innocent charm of movie characters of the 30's.<br /><br />However, all of this adds up to nothing if the visual effects weren't effective. And fortunately, they are not only effective, but they blow away the entire film. The look of this picture is unlike anything seen before, thanks to primary visionary Kerry Coran and his team of cohorts. Dark, sepia tones, magnificent special effects, incredible use of light and shadow all adds up to a visual feast never seen on cinema before.<br /><br />It astonishes me how the Oscars this year skipped over this film, maybe perhaps it will be recognized in its technical achievement. In the years to come, it will serve as a benchmark in movie making.and shadow all adds up to a visual feast never seen on cinema before.<br /><br />It astonishes me how the Oscars this year skipped over this film, maybe perhaps it will be recognized in its technical achievement.

B0006IIPIK|5.0|This movie reminds me of a Disney film long ago, about Dave Stevens character, \\"The Rocketeer.\\"  If Disney had CGI at the time, the movie would have been a success.  This one is in the spirit of the old time movie serials and while the action wasn't over the top in many places it was a very good movie. I did like the fact that, as one of the reviewers put it, there was no modern profanity and nudity.  It'd be out of place in this perfect movie about a retro future that looks like it came straight out of the 1940's art deco era.  I wonder if Dave Stevens is promoting a new version of his character after watching this?
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I'm probably 30-35 years older than this film's optimal audience, but I loved \\"Napoleon Dynamite.\\"<br /><br />The obvious comparison is \\"Welcome to the Doll's House,\\" which turned the pain of being a geeky kid inside out into a horror show; but I don't think \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is that ambitious. It's basically follows the model of dozens of nerd wish fulfillment movies and TV shows, to the point of parody. It works because of its unique rhythm, odd characters, constant surprises, funny deadpan dialogue, inventive sight gags, and outrageous performances.  Napoleon is a nerd, but he's a stalwart nerd who basically doesn't want to change any more than is absolutely necessary.  He's stoically willing to pay the price, and he spends half his time dealing with people who are even stranger than himself--especially equally out-of-it brother and his smarmy uncle. Kip Dynamite, the older brother, looks like Wally Cox on the Atkins plan.  The uncle is Napoleon's true nemesis, a pathetically overconfident salesman of products that nobody wants.<br /><br />The story pivots around two events:  Napoleon's realization that to win the girl he seems, ambivalently, to want, he needs \\"skills\\"; and the arrival of Kip's girlfriend, a woman he met in an internet chat room. Shortly after her hilarious arrival, and her transformation of Kip into a mutant hip-hopper, she hands Napoleon a crucial gift.  The result is a huge comic payoff that, on reflection, makes no sense, but is such a bizarre and hilarious surprise, you buy it because it's too good to question.  The film makes Idaho seems like another planet, but that's because of the filmmaking \\"skills\\" on display.

B00005JN4O|4.0|The story of how JM Barrie came to write the children's classic Peter Pan certainly did alter a few facts, but movie adaptions just have to do it for excitement. Despite his sometimes halting British accent, the dashing Johnny Depp does come across as convincing as the playwright. Often pensive, his world brightens up when he meets the widow Slyvia Davies (Kate Winslet) and her 4 children.<br /><br />Locked in a loveless marriage and facing a writer's block, Depp's character begins to enjoy many moments with the family and is especially charmed by the little boy called Peter. That brings out the child in Barrie who becomes inspiredto base his new play Peter Pan on this family and their summer spent togther. Kate Winslet is consummate as the just widowed Slyvia, trying to keep the fmaily together while hiding her deteiorating condition from everyone else. The chemistry between the two lead actors is flawless though the screenplay does lean towards suggesting that there is more than just a platonic relationship between the two.<br /><br />As usual, Julie Christie lends great support as the tyrannical but protective mother to Kate Winslet's Slyvia. And of course, the movie wouldn't work without the innocent charms of the little boy who played Peter, Freddie Highmore. He wears an expression that already shows much of a grown-up in the body of a child with that soulful eye that speaks.<br /><br />Be prepared for the whimsical finale where a dying Slyvia visits Neverland. Get ready for the Kleenex moment.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|I waited for a long time for Paramount to release Star Trek The Original Series in one-volume single season sets.  This seven disc Season Two set contains every episode from the second season plus some bonus features.  The production quality is outstanding on these disks and they are well worth the price if you are an avid Star Trek fan. <br /> <br />The second season probably is Star Trek's best season and contains some of the best writing and episodes of the three year run.  Some of my personal favorites include: <br /> <br />Mirror, Mirror where Kirk, Scotty, Uhura, and Dr. McCoy are sent to a parallel universe during a transporter malfunction and end up in an Enterprise where the crew is the opposite - war like, violent, and promotion is made through assassination. <br /> <br />I, Mudd, where we meet Harry Mudd, the nefarious space merchant. <br /> <br />Probably the most popular and beloved Star Trek episode, The Trouble with Tribbles, where a space station and the Enterprise is overwhelmed with the soft, fuzzy, creatures called Tribbles. <br /> <br />And my other favorite is The Ultimate Computer where the writers have told a cautionary tale about replacing humans with computers. <br /> <br />All the episodes for Season Two are in this set, so you're personal favorites from that season will be there too! <br /> <br />The special features are really not that good.  Most of them I found a little boring.  The best special features in this set are a montage about Nichelle Nichols who plays Uhura and an interview with D.C. Fontana, who wrote or co-wrote many of the scripts, and edited many others. <br />
B000002UVX|5.0|I was at this show, and I saw Jimi play 17 times. I was raised to play music, and had some talent. When Jimi came along, all musicians hailed the Messiah. We would hitchhike, fly, walk or crawl to see him play wherever we could. We all realized we were lucky to see a real, true genius in our lifetimes. All the hype, whatever you want to say, if you ever heard this man play live...your live was ruined...in the most beautiful way imaginable...<br /><br />I am grateful every day of my life that I heard him and met him.<br /><br />I am grateful that there are recordings of this genius. I have been listening to these recordings for years and years and years.  Everything else pales in comparison. I love all music. I have seen Miles, Dizzy, Zeppelin, Stevie Wonder, Pavarotti, Maurizio Pollini, and El Camaron. I lived next door to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. What can I say?  NOBODY, and I mean nobody could touch Jimi Hendrix. Who knows why?  He was truly in a league of his own.<br /><br />We were a bunch of silly kids when he did this gig. We were all smoking pot in the balcony.  He was young and so full of fun, too. Really, so sweet, and so generous, and absolutely naive. I met him a few times...he was funny, gracious, polite, and had no idea that he was one of the greatest geniuses of all times.<br /><br />Personally, right now... I think the opening of \\"Power of Love\\"<br /><br />is the most beautiful of all of Hendrix's recordings.  LISTEN TO THIS. PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS. GOD IS IN THERE.<br /><br />Over the years I have realized, of course, Jimi needed to be playing with black Americans, which is why the incredible beauty of Billy Cox's solos come thru. Jimi and Billy were in the Army together. Beautiful music can be found everywhere.<br /><br />God bless you Billy.<br /><br />People are so mean about Buddy Miles. I understand. But Jimi needed people like Buddy Miles to keep him sane in the situation he was in. Do you people realize that when, and if, he chose to play, 100,000 people would show up...His life got<br /><br />so crazy..<br /><br />Because,<br /><br />He was the greatest muscial genius of the 20th century.<br /><br />Everybody knew that.<br /><br />Even Miles had to admit..<br /><br />Jimi kicked his ass.<br /><br />Peace, love, out.<br /><br />----gio------100,000 people would show up...His life got  <br />so crazy.. <br /> <br />Because, <br /> <br />He was the greatest muscial genius of the 20th century. <br /> <br />Everybody knew that. <br /> <br />Even Miles had to admit.. <br /> <br />Jimi kicked his ass. <br /> <br />Peace, love, out. <br /> <br />----gio------
B0006L7U9W|2.0|Why does the world of tomorrow look like 1930's Art-deco? You know? The past? Nice attempt to create the feel of old crappy Hollywood serials, but it felt like there were only 5 actors (and people) in the entire film and the purposefully bad dialogue and characterization was pretty annoying after five minutes. It might have worked better if it actually seemed like the actors were in the scene when they were filmed, instead of pasted in from shots made in a broom closet. If you want cool footage of dirigibles and flying robots, go see Hayao Miyazakis Castle in the Sky. Im pretty sure the director did.<br />Actually, if the critical faculties are turned off, this really isnt a bad time waster, even if the sepia-tone makes things look out of focus instead of creating a sense of nostalgia.

B0001LYH9S|4.0|Not only do I consider OUTSIDE Bowie's best album since 1981's SCARY MONSTERS, OUTSIDE is my current favorite Bowie album. I recommended it without hesitation to industrial rock fans, Enophiles, and anyone who appreciates dark, adventurous sounds. However, if you already own the original pressing, there's no need to buy this album a second time. The remastering offers no improvement over the original edition's superb sonics. As other reviewers have noted, the reproduction of the digital booklet art and Bowie's cover painting are markedly inferior to the original digipak. The bonus track is a throwaway. I would have preferred to see OUTSIDE reissued in a deluxe edition with a disc of live material from the OUTSIDE tour, which included blistering versions of \\"Look Back in Anger\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs,\\" as well as electronic arrangements of vintage songs such as \\"Andy Warhol\\" and \\"The Man Who Sold the World.\\"
B0006IIKS0|5.0|I just finished watching this and just wanted to get my comments down while they were still fresh.  A lot has been written about Metallica and the therapy with Phil Towle, Lars and his paintings and such.  I'll admit that Towles's psychobabble didn't make much of an impression on me but it helped Metallica stay together as a band and that's the most important thing.  I thought it was very cool that Metallica allowed themselves to be shown in a very revealing light.  I'm very happy that James, Lars, Kirk, and Rob will be making more music.  I think it's trendy to bash Metallica these days and I'm not on that bandwagon.  On another note, I wish that Dave Mustaine could know how much joy his music has brought me and others over the years.  It was hard to see how much pain he still carries over his ouster from Metallica.  I hope that he can find peace someday.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The \\"Wicked\\" music is great. My only complaints are that Kristin Chenoweth (Glinda) and Norbert Leo Butz (Fiyero) are very underused throughout the entire play. Idina Menzel (Elphaba) has a powerful voice, but she is not always on target when she sings. <br /> <br />The words are pretty good, and the beautiful melodies compensate for any iffy lyrics. <br /> <br />Although you can especially appreciate the score if you have seen the play, this \\"Wicked\\" CD caters to a wide and diverse audience. Nice CD for driving.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|Some Kind of Monster is a really powerful documentary on Metallicas tumultuous period while recording St. Anger. Fans get to see a side of the band that has never been publicly revealed before, but I also believe the film will also appeal to anyone interested in the creative process, or with how people who have worked together for a long period of time need to address their problems with each other in order to move forward.<br />I dont want to repeat what others have said about the film, so Ill just comment on some of the DVD related extras. The bonus scenes for the most part are really interesting and in some ways address the missing humour from the main body of the film. Anyone whos seen Metallicas other taped escapades (the Year and a Half in DVD and some of their Fan Club videos) probably wondered as I did if Metallica were always miserable during the recording process of this album. James post rehab came across as fairly humourless in the film, but his usual joking personality is still present in these dropped scenes.  Its clear that a number of these scenes werent used because it would have conflicted with the rebirthing process that Berlinger and Sinofsky were trying to demonstrate. They made the right decision for the film, and Im glad that we are able to see these scenes on the bonus DVD.<br />My favourite cut scene is James talks about his childhood. I really connected with this short monologue while hes driving. It opened a window into what made him happy during the bad times of his youth and I think it goes a long way into explaining why he is the way he is. His comments on first picking up a guitar were so dead on funny (being a guitar player myself). <br />The commentary track with the directors is really good, but anyone who has read This Monster by Berlinger will get a lot of repeat information. Less impressive is the commentary track from the band, unfortunately. There are a few gems within, but its mostly dead air,comments on what people are wearing and who hadnt showered. Not a lot of insight and only worth watching for die-hards.
B000006TRV|5.0|This is the biggest thing in the world. A double-disk concept album that manages to conform to the Pink Floyd sound whilst simultaneously pandering to the growing infatuation with all things punk -- or Punk Floyd, if you will. The story goes that bandleader-bassist Roger Waters was so mortified when over-enthusiastic fans wouldn't sit still during an acoustic rendition of Pigs on the Wing that he pulled one of the spotty upstarts from the crowd and spat in his face... ironically enough, a year later when punk finally broke, this was very much in vogue. However, for Roger, it was enough to send him into a spiral of shame, depression, and shoe gazing... most of which, would find its way into the themes and concepts of this legendary record. <br /> <br />The sound and motivation is somewhat schizophrenic... with Waters seemingly attempting to create five albums at once. On the one hand, this is a continuation of HIS Pink Floyd sound developed on Dark Side of the Moon, and more importantly, on the harder, more political Animals. Having said that, it is also an uneasy combination of fictionalised concept rock, ala Tommy by the WHO, juxtaposed with the semi-autobiographical honesty of singer-songwriters, like Dylan, Lennon and Neil Young. The concept then goes on to run two stories in parallel... one dealing with the inner-turmoil of a burnt out rock-star left jaded by the hostility of the industry, the treachery of women and the effect of hallucinogenic drugs... the other dealing with the rock-star's carefully constructed fantasy life as a fascistic demagogue hell-bent on cleaning out the dead-wood of a quickly rotting England. <br /> <br />The record then goes on to incorporate elements of dark-humour and political satire in order to tone down the dark extremities of Waters' lyrical ideals. At the time the band were attacked for racism, and now, over twenty-five years later, politically-correct listeners may be offended by the fictional rock star Pink lamenting 'Jews','coons' and 'queers' whilst referencing the holocaust with lines like 'turn on the showers and fire the ovens' and so forth... None of it is meant to offend of course, the record, as it is, being a lament against late 70's Britain and the fascistic fashion of people like Sid Vicious who wore swastika t-shirts and Jordan (not the 'I'm a Celebrity'!) who often appeared on TV wearing Nazi regalia such as arm-bands and leather-caps. It also has a lot to do with the government of the time, and particularly the infatuation with people like Enoch Powell (I'm not sure on the full details of this, as I wasn't born at the time). <br /> <br />If the lyrics can be described as aggressive, cathartic, and as in your face as anything else, then the music goes a long way to reflect it. This is a Pink Floyd eons away from the acoustic space-folk of songs like Wish You Were Here, Fat Old Sun and Shine on you Crazy Diamond, with the arrangements built around Waters' pounding bass, Gilmour's piercing guitar, and Mason's machine-gun drumming. By this point, Rick Wright had been booted out for not contributing to the song-writing process, so for the most part, keyboards are out, with the great (and sorely missed) Michael Kaman filling in on grand piano. Elsewhere, the production by Gilmour, Waters and Bob Ezrin (Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, Peter Gabriel) is sharp, loud, and multi-layered, relying on sound effects more than any other Pink Floyd record before or since. A great big musical storybook of war, death, genocide and social alienation... <br /> <br />This is one of the defining musical masterpieces. As hard and aggressive as anything by the Clash, the Pistols or the Damned, though with an emotional resonance that few records can equate. It is impossible to pick a standalone track from this epic rock monster, though surely everyone is familiar with surprise Christmas number one Another Brick in the Wall (Part II) -- \\"we don't need no education... we don't need no thought control!\\" whilst the epic mid-record turning point Comfortably Numb was recently murdered by the scissor sisters (here's the original instead). This is a record that all true lovers of music should experience... as ambitious as it gets.  <br /> <br />( Adrian Pennington from Great Britain ) <br /> <br />
0960191038|4.0|Seven years ago I reviewed this book, as follows: <br /> <br />It's your choice; build a rubble pile or a pyramid..., November 29, 1997 <br /> <br />Ms. Minto's book is a classic example of a gem in the rough. Yes, it isn't visually impressive, and yes it is well worth using. Note that I said using, not reading. You won't realize the value of the methods Ms. Minto presents if you don't try them out; repeatedly. <br /> <br />My suggestion? Go to the chapters that contain examples first, and read them thoroughly. Then find a short report or memo you find particularly opaque, and read the book cover to cover, occasionally referring to your example. Finally, go back to those sections of The Pyramid Principle that apply to the example you found and start re-working it per Ms. Minto's methods. <br /> <br />When you're done, do it again, with another piece. Then re-read the book at least once a year. It's worth it. <br /> <br />Anyone can build a jumbled pile of stones. It takes time and practice to build an orderly structure that will stand on its own merits. The Pyramid Principle will help you become a verbal architect. I think it is well worth using! <br /> <br />--- <br /> <br />I stand by my previous reviewm with the following proviso:  <br /> <br />There is value to find here, but you must be a hard-rock miner to get to it.  This is a book that provides techniques to use, not just read.  If you're not willing to practice, to swing your pick again and again until you strike paydirt, then go find something  easier.
B0002OERI0|1.0|...how much Green Day has pissed me off for the past decade. Now, they churn out another redundant, formulaic, angry-white-\\"punk\\"-rock piece of garbage. If that wasn't enough, now all the cog-like Clear Channel and Viacom radio stations are currently blaring this tone-deaf garbage across the nation, just to remind us all of how screwed we all are. <br /> <br />To any musically-aspired person, do NOT take today's music for any source of inspiration. Instead look WAYYYY back to the Renaissance musicians: Bach, Baroque, Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, and more. Look back to the early 20th century pivotal musicians: Miles Davis, James Brown, Hendrix, and all the others. <br /> <br />Don't, under ANY circumstance, become \\"enlightened\\" by MTV-stamped-of-approval hydrogenated scum that still reap billions in profit due to musical ignorance of the general public.
6304907648|4.0|If you like suspense, mystery, a good story, and for the most part, good acting, then this movie is a good choice. What I like about Copycat (besides Sigourney Weaver) is how it seems to come full circle. It feels complete to me. It starts at the beginning, doesn't backtrack with flashbacks or start in the middle and leave you wondering what's going on. You're able to follow along and not get distracted by unnecessary gore (sure there is some, but not much). It's a psychological thriller, and I like that much better than the slash and dash type of movies. It makes you think and allows you to try and figure out what the outcome will be.<br /><br />Sure, you expect the star to live, but it's not always a given. The ending kind of hints at a sequel but as far as I know, there isn't one. If they can make one as good as the first, I think it would do well (at least those who enjoyed this one, might see the second). It's rather interesting to see the Harry Connick Jr. play a serial killer. He's pretty creepy.
0385510454|3.0|I have always enjoyed Grisham's books, if for no other reason than they are fun to read, seldom dull, and usually involve some sort of higher level moral message.  I also enjoyed the few books that did not follow his usual lawyer genre, like the Painted House.<br /><br />In this latest effort, we follow the life of an ex-lawyer who has just been given a Presidential pardon, and released into Bologna, Italy, where it will be his job to assimilate, learn the language and survive.  In reality the CIA wants him out there to see which government will find him and kill him, thereby helping them solve some of the mystery behind the international incident that landed the lead character in prison to begin with.<br /><br />So, most of the book takes place in Italy, where our character has assumed a new name and is trying to learn Italian and fit in.  This is where it appears that Grisham took a long vacation from writing, spent several months strolling around the city, noting all the historical and cultural sights and sounds, and then sat down and wrote a book around what is basically a tourist guide to Bologna Italy.  Seriously, it really does read this way.  After dozens of pages describing the most arcane aspects of the city, all of which are quite interesting yet have nothing to do with the story, this foundation starts seeming a bit obvious.<br /><br />However, it works.  I really did enjoy the brief vacation myself.  The book reads with a balance of calmness and tension.  Towards the end it all comes together in typical Grisham fashion.  In fact, just take the first 5 and last 5 chapters and you have a garden-variety Grisham thriller.<br /><br />I recommend waiting for the paperback, but do recommend this book if you both like Grisham novels, and love Italy.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Quite possibly Radiohead's greatest album thus far... Hail to the Thief is a complete chaotic workout of sonic landscapes, music styles, and 21st century paranoia. If you thought they'd reached their creative peak with 1997's first masterpiece OK Computer, before going all techno-ambient on Kid A & Amnesiac respectively, then you NEED to experience this record. Hail to the Thief builds on the style and themes of OK Computer, as well as the free form experimentation of their last two records, whilst injecting more immediate elements without the notion of compromise. This is not a sell out! This is the work of a band so comfortable and sure of their own creative prowess that they couldn't possibly repeat the avant-garde textures of Kid A/MNESIAC... just as they couldn't possibly retreat back into the comfort of non-challenging stadium rock, ala the Bends. <br /> <br />The music here is rich in layered imagery and musical atmos.... with the band reaching something of a creative peak in terms of record production, whilst Yorke turns in some of his best ever lyrics. This is possibly their most personal album to date. A stark rumination on thirty-something angst, the state of the world, parenthood, marriage, death, destruction, psychosis, and all the other nocturnal rambling we associate with their greatest work. To call it some kind of artistic maturing would be entirely appropriate... with the music going further away from the usual contemporary rock than ever before, taking on board elements of jazz, progressive, electronica, grunge, ambience, and everything in between. The opening track sets some kind of tone, 2+2=5, a combination of progressive rock, massive attack electronica, porno funk and JG Ballard. Yorke screams the central refrain \\"pay attention\\" over and over again until the words sink deep into our subconscious... either that, or lose all meaning. <br /> <br />Both Sit Down/Stand Up and Sail to the Moon introduce the slow burning jazz template first established on songs like the National Anthem and Life in a Glass House... which clearly demonstrates that the band have been spinning their Miles Davis records recently. The atmosphere developed in these songs is much more intense though; fitting in perfectly with the anxiety ridden would view of both the band and the record as a whole. Backdrifts continues the electronic sound of Kid A, and is the perfect primer for the even more experimental track the Gloaming (the album's subtitle)... another one of Yorke's Aphex Twin samplers. There There was the big single at the time, and I recall with glee the three-drum live performances on Jonathan Ross and Jools Holland... very close to the Radiohead of the Bends/OK Comp in terms of music, whilst the lyrics reference Talk Talk circa Spirit of Eden. <br /> <br />I Will is a beautiful ballad that recalls No Surprises, with lyrics that reference Yorke's becoming a father, and concerns over his young child's future. Anyone who listens to this track and fails to be affected by the singer's peen of \\"little baby's eyes\\" and is unable to comprehend what the band as a whole are trying to say should really stop listening now. A Punch Up At A Wedding (title!) has shades of Magazine/PIL in terms of music, with guitars layered over computerised pulses, though lyrically it's much closer to Dylan... with the band offering multiple narrative viewpoints in a single sentence, as well as offering the killer hook line, \\"you had to p-ss on our parade/you had to wreck our perfect day\\". Next up comes Myxomatosis (am I the only person in the world that likes this song), which takes on the lyrical standpoint of such luminaries as Elvis Costello, Mark E. Smith and Kevin Rowland by attacking certain aspects of British culture; the upper classes, celebrity obsessives and paparazzi scum. <br /> <br />Scatterbrain is a nice little lullaby, which similar to I Will, reflects Yorke's growing concerns about his baby's future, before moving into the epic closing number A Wolf at the Door. Here the darker aspects of the lyrics are again highlighted with \\"smacks you in the head, knifes you in the neck, kicks you in the teeth\\" etc, while the backing harmonies and layered instrumentation bring to mind that 90's Bohemian Rhapsody `Paranoid Android'... This is a pivotal album for Radiohead, demonstrating both a progression and maturity in terms of playing and song writing. It's going to be very interesting to see where they go from here...  <br /> <br />( Adrian Pennington from the UK ) <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000931OG|1.0|I am a Blur fan, have been for a long time.  This album fell flat and just plain didn't grab me.  Nothing catchy or hit-worthy as is the Blur cookbook.  I can't help think that without Graham, the band is lost.  (That copy protection thing means no play on my MP3 player either, no good!)
B000002GQL|5.0|Seventh Sojourn is, in my opinion, the best of the original seven Moody recordings. Released just prior to the group's  disbanding, it is an album that has little of the slightly dark, brooding, mystical songs that could be found occasionally in many of the previous albums. The one exception is the first song, \\"Lost in a lost world\\" by Mike Pinder, which, like many of Mike Pinder's songs, is not as melodic as other band member's songs. After that is out of the way, each song is filled with lovely, uplifting rythms and profound lyrics, mostly on the subject of love. Is there a more lovely love song than \\"For my lady\\" by Ray Thomas? Ok, I guess Hayward has written scores of them just as lovely. Seventh Sojourn is literally a masterpiece.
B000669GAI|5.0|I will start off by saying that I am in no way a big fan of Pearl Jam, nor have I followed their career at all. I do, however, like most of the singles they have released which is all this CD contains. This is a great 2-CD set, the first disc contains their more intense songs with the second disc being their slower, more brooding songs. This is, without a doubt, worth every cent of what it costs.<br /><br />Disc one is, like I stated earlier, more of their heavier songs. Songs like Even Flow and Jeremy, a couple of their huge hits, are contained on this disc. There are a few songs of Pearl Jam's that I have never heard that are included in this set, all of which are really good. The first CD seems to catch the intensity Pearl Jam offers in concert incredibly. Disc two is their slower songs, a lot of which have acoustic guitar in it. Songs like Black, Daughter and Yellow Ledbetter show their more vulnerable side perfectly. I think that by separating the two different sides of Pearl Jam into two completely different CDs was a brilliant idea. That way if you're in a mellow mood you can listen to disc two, or if you're more hyped up, disc one is perfect for you.<br /><br />Just a few of my favorite songs included in this are Alive, Dissident, Black, and Yellow Ledbetter. I can understand if the true Pearl Jam fans aren't impressed with this release, but if you're like me you just listen for enjoyment. Enjoyment is exactly what you feel when you listen to this too. This is a greatest hits CD so don't think that there will be some song of their's that you haven't heard before included, it's merely hits, nothing more nothing less.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Without Radiohead there would be no Coldplay, no Keane, no Muse and the interest in the Smiths would be considerably lower. Denying that Radiohead are one of the most influential, interesting and innovative bands in music's history is like denying that you don't need oxygen in your lungs - quite frankly - it's a fact of life. <br />It's often said that radiohead are depressing - I can see the point, but Radiohead songs aren't all doom, gloom and 'the end of the world is nigh' - you can save that for Muse. Infact, closer inspection of their back catalogue reveals intricate, beautiful melodies, riff laden,stadium filling rock anthems and satirical, meaningful and consistently brilliantly sung lyrics (courtesy of singer Thom Yorke) - EVERY SONG ON OK COMPUTER is a gem. <br />Now, this album won't be for everyone - but it bloody well should be - it's essential, it's avant garde, it's one of the best albums ive ever heard. I don't like everything Radiohead have produced, but this offering draws me back time after time after time without a doubt. It's the most life changing album ive ever listened to - and what you get from this album depends on how willing you are to actually listen to it. <br />Very few of the songs are about depressing subjects or even sung depressngly - on the contrary - Thom Yorke's vocals add a character, emotion and life into each song that ranges from down trodden and heart broken to world beating and all knowing. This is a fine album from one of the greatest all time bands. <br /> <br />PS: for the 1 star sissies: STOP TRYING TO PUT DOWN THIS QUINTESSENTIAL ALBUM. Thanks <br />
0812550706|5.0|With Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card manages to create a masterpiece. Card creates a wonderful character in Ender Wiggin. He uses wonderful characterization and includes a healthy dose of psychology, giving great depth to an already fascinating story. The situations he places Ender in create empathy in anyone who ha ever faced the great challenge of peer judgement or sibling rivalry.     Ender Wiggin and his family rise up to great challenges and overcome them, despite their age. This sends a great message, because often in our society gifted children and teenagers are overlooked and passed off as inferior.          Ender's Game is filled with intensity. The battles and fight scenes thorughout the book are so well written that I found myself unable to put the book down while I was reading them. Maybe after people read this they will realize how capable some children are. A modern masterpiece, Ender's game is a must read for all.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I feel this movie is unfunny and a waste of time. The only people who enjoy this are the MTV-crowd and the people who hang out at the local \\"Hot-Topic\\". If you want a REAL comedy get \\"Blazing Saddles\\" or \\"Wet Hot American Summer\\" instead. Don't waste your time here.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Wow, Chris Ochman. That \\"rather odd\\" tale of how you came across Muse was off the hook, man. You heard a song, tried to find the band that played it, and ran across Muse along the way. <br /> <br />Yep. That's \\"rather odd\\" alright. <br /> <br />I have a pretty odd story about how I came across Muse. I wrote it down on a Christmas list for others to buy it for me, and when Christmas came along -- holy hell, what do you know! Muse! <br /> <br />Rather odd, wouldn't you say? <br /> <br />Seriously, man. <br /> <br />Now, say, if you had walked down the street and a bird crapped on the sidewalk in front of you, and the bird turd slowly morphed into the actual band Muse, who handed you an autographed copy of Absolution, then I'd say THAT was a \\"rather odd\\" way to come across Muse. <br /> <br />Let's say I have a yo-yo in my hand. If this yo-yo, once looped around my finger, magically led me down the street and down a pothole into the sewers where a mutant race of Jackalopes handed me an autographed copy of Absolution, that'd be a rather odd way of coming across Muse. <br /> <br />Let's set our standards a little higher. Just for fun. All I ask.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Quite why this was so derided on its initial release (and still, to some extent, today!) is beyond me. This was U2 sounding like the biggest band in the world, eons away from the tired stadium act of the Rattle & Hum LP/concert-film/clothing-range/etc, which postured towards trad-Americana, but with none of the soul (instead, sounding hollow and conceited)... this, on the other hand, was U2 sounding fresh and exciting, referencing the music of the time, with acts like Disposable Heroes, the Happy Mondays and My Bloody Valentine, not to mention the edgy music being produced by their post-punk peers, with bands like Talk Talk and Depeche Mode both producing self-consciously weird albums with Laughing Stock and Violator, respectively. <br /> <br />So, we had U2 doing their best, which remains their greatest thing, for all intensive purposes. Pop on the other hand is the first step towards the alien-U2 landscape that would be further developed on the Original Soundtracks album; a record so 'out-there' they had to release it under a different name (The Passengers). This was a band that had little in common with the group that had released such earnest, political, new-wave stuff like Bullet in the Blue Sky, I Will Follow and Sunday Bloody Sunday, & instead, produced music that was self-aware, ultra-post modern and seemed to be taking the p*ss out of the whole idea of U2 as a franchise (\\"...be all that you can be\\"). Understandably, the fans and critics of the time wrote the whole thing off as an arty-self-indulgent exercise, criticising U2's decision to experiment with dance rhythms and techno production and generally, missing the point of the whole endeavour, entirely. <br /> <br />It seems stupid to think of this now, with Pop prefiguring Radiohead's similarly elating trek into the realms of ambient, experimentation, with albums like Kid & Amnesiac... though, there too, we saw a public furore, all because music critics seem to think all modern rock bands should sound like All That You Can't Leave Behind. Yawn!! Still, U2 were pushing the boundaries in 1997 and the world seemed a better place. Don't believe me? Just sit back and pop this record on and force yourself to put aside all reservations you have about U2 doing anything other than All That You Can't Leave Behind, & just listen. Then, when it's all over, go back to the start and listen again. This is intoxicating stuff, filled with tight rhythms, bold instrumentation and soaring lyrics. The production too, is just great, sounding positively futuristic for 1997 standards, and still holds up exceptionally well, over a decade on. <br /> <br />Listen to the opening of Pop to see what I mean; with the three producers creating an outstanding weird moment, with distorted sound-scapes guitars, and a rising bass. It picks up where Achtung Baby left off, with emotional lyrics fusing with advertising slogans and really shows U2 as still, perhaps the most pretentious band in the world, but certainly having fun with it. Do You Feel Loved continues this with the sound of the opening, as strong as any U2 rocker that came before, with Bono's vocals fitting the instrumentation perfectly, before the whole things shifts and pulsating programming and Adam Clayton's bass emerges, as Bono starts to sing. It becomes a sort of mantra. Mofo was the best glimpse of this new avant-garde U2, and takes off around a dirty-guitar loop, with lots of synthesised back-beats devised by Flood going on around it. An amazing Euro Beat. <br /> <br />Speaking of which, Mofo is post-industrial, loved-up U2 techno soul in all it's neon glory, with the band creating a really rock back-beat for Bono to sing powerful lyrics over the top of. At near 6 minutes, it remains the album's centre piece, transcending musical moments that are so very rare in our days of homogenised pop. The next track, If God Will Send His Angels, sounds absolutely stunning... up there with other great U2 ballads like With or Without You, One andRunning To Stand Still. It's probably one my favourite U2 song of all time, with Bono's most heartbreaking lyrics. <br /> <br />The following tracks don't continue the same formula, being all edgy and experimental in a different way, raising U2's emotion and intensity. However, the band leave the most bizarre construction till last songs, Please and closing track Wake Up Dead Man. Both are shocking really. Please is one of their truly best political statements, whereas Wake Up Dead Man contains ashort burst of ambient white noise (very Motion Picture Soundtrack!), which brings the record to a close in a way that could just about be described as perfect.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban once again hits it big with the hot single \\"You Raise Me Up\\". This time around, Josh is going to get creative on his own terms. <br /> <br />First order of business is \\"Mi Mancherai (Il Postino)\\", of which he once again performs with a violin soloist, Joshua Bell. This song is a beautiful remake of an Italian opera song, which is Josh's speciality. But yet no one would truly think him as a songwriter until they heard his deeply beautiful \\"Remember When it Rained\\" of which he played piano and sang back-up vocals, creating for himself a \\"Paul Simon\\"-esque position for himself in the music industry now. <br /> <br />The CD introduces his voice in the traditional \\"Oceano\\" of which he begins \\"Piove su'll oceano\\" (It rained on the ocean) in such a tender voice, it would shock you in the chorus that his voice carries its own weight of emotion that he pulls in any song he does. <br /> <br />This album also introduces Josh's curiosity in synthesizers and different sounds, as in the song \\"Never Let Go\\", which I think is very similiar to Massive Attack with Josh's ability to make those Latino octaves fly all over the place. <br /> <br />While remembering his Italian roots, \\"Closer\\" also premieres five new (and some classic) English-sung songs that can not dish the supreme stardom \\"You're Still You\\" or \\"To Where You Are\\" brought. Michael Jackson's many timed re-done \\"She's Out of My Life\\" concludes the album with a broken heart and Groban's ability to jerk tears from any woman's eyes. <br /> <br />My personal favorite English songs are \\"When You Say You Love Me\\" with some of the most beautiful lines contained \\"At times I can't move/At times I can hardly breathe\\", \\"Remember When it Rained\\" [\\"Felt the ground and looked up high and called your name\\"] and already released [on Josh Groban's Live Concert CD & DVD] \\"Broken Vow\\" (I'll give away my soul to hold you once again/And never let this promise end\\"]. <br /> <br />Snagging Andrea Boccelli's \\"Caruso\\" [of which he gives a power-house performance that would give Boccelli shivers!] and even siging the new \\"All'Improvviso Amore\\" makes this the Latin-licked \\"Canto Alla Vita\\" of this album. English or Italian, Spanish or simply Josh's creations, Josh is beginning to get more personal and \\"Closer\\" by the minute!
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Im at a bit of a loss on how to describe this movie, perhaps an action adventure, sci-fi, film noir. What ever you call it there is non stop action and the film truly has a 1940's serial feel to it. While the \\"critics\\" didnt seem to like it much i was very much taken with the effects and for once in a modern film the comic relief was refreshingly comic. While im sure its not for everyone i would recomend this movie as one of the better ones to come from the ever failing hollywood. Where remakes and shallow attemps at drama abound this one is truly unique and quite a fun watch.
B000092T6M|3.0|Original Theatrical Release gets 5 stars. <br />The New Extended Release gets 3 stars. <br /> <br />I have a simple plea to film directors.  PLEASE STOP TURNING OUT DIRECTOR CUTS when you release older films out on DVD.  <br /> <br />Case in point Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves.  The original cut was one of my favorite films of all time.  I love this movie but now with the additional deleted scenes put back into the film my love for it has dwindle.  Through out the original cut of the film there were winks and nods to certain elements in the film like the Sherrif being raised by a witch.  The additional scenes that further explains the Sherrif's background turns the movie from an old time action adventure into a campy cartoon.  Also there is a scene where a little girl goes to Morgan Freeman, who plays Robin's Moorish companion from the Crusades, and asks why did God paint him.  In the original cut Freeman explains with some charm and a smile and the scene cuts away but in this extended edition the holier than thou fryar marches in and confronts Freeman.  I do realize the extended scene was to further set up the differences between the two men and religions so to make it more meaningful when the come together to fight tyrany but I have to say in the end the dialogue is forced and it feels a bit like a lecture being acted out.  The editor of the original theatrical version of this film was wise to cut that scene short.   <br /> <br />True the clarity of the digital transfer is much better than the previous DVD release (which was the theatrical version)and its nice that I don't have to flip the disc over to watch the second half of the movie but it matters little when dealing with the horrible alterations done to this film.   <br /> <br />I'm sure this is part of a Warner Bros marketting ploy; continually ruining their film franchises all to make a few extra dollars.  Milk the buyer for all its worth.  First offer a dvd of the original release that has a lousy video and audio transfer.  Second offer a special edition dvd that offers better quality but also a version of the film that is not what audiences fell in love with and then lastly (hopefully) release a dvd that is the original theatrical release, with superior quality, and extras.  Well I say forget them.  I'm going back to my crappy old dvd.  The video may look comparable to an old vhs tape but atleast its the Robin Hood I know and love to watch.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Without Radiohead there would be no Coldplay, no Keane, no Muse and the interest in the Smiths would be considerably lower. Denying that Radiohead are one of the most influential, interesting and innovative bands in music's history is like denying that you don't need oxygen in your lungs - quite frankly - it's a fact of life. <br />It's often said that radiohead are depressing - I can see the point, but Radiohead songs aren't all doom, gloom and 'the end of the world is nigh' - you can save that for Muse. Infact, closer inspection of their back catalogue reveals intricate, beautiful melodies, riff laden,stadium filling rock anthems and satirical, meaningful and consistently brilliantly sung lyrics (courtesy of singer Thom Yorke) - EVERY SONG ON OK COMPUTER is a gem. <br />Now, this album won't be for everyone - but it bloody well should be - it's essential, it's avant garde, it's one of the best albums ive ever heard. I don't like everything Radiohead have produced, but this offering draws me back time after time after time without a doubt. It's the most life changing album ive ever listened to - and what you get from this album depends on how willing you are to actually listen to it. <br />Very few of the songs are about depressing subjects or even sung depressngly - on the contrary - Thom Yorke's vocals add a character, emotion and life into each song that ranges from down trodden and heart broken to world beating and all knowing. This is a fine album from one of the greatest all time bands. <br /> <br />PS: for the 1 star sissies: STOP TRYING TO PUT DOWN THIS QUINTESSENTIAL ALBUM. Thanks <br />
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|Franz Ferdinand is the kind of band that has instant appeal. The first time I heard the album... I knew I was going to like it. Its a fun rock CD, with a \\"Genghis Khan - Moscow\\" feel to many of the songs. They have great character on stage and the hooks and lines are really fantastic.  <br /> <br />But there is something about Franz... something lacking. It may be its formula to songs... or just maybe because they are always played alongside MTV's Britney, Steffani and Nelly...etc. <br /> <br />I always catch myself skipping the songs half way through the track... even though I like them. Maybe its because the songs are so mono-tone, the intensity rarely dropping or raising. Each song plays the same from beginning to end. <br /> <br />In the end... Ive found that I tell people I like Franz Ferdinand but Ive noticed I barely listen to it. <br />
0553381407|5.0|I picked up this book in secrecy one day while browsing through a book store, afraid that someone might know that my family at home was a little messed up.  <br /> <br />My dad along with my stepmom it turns out, came from abusive families themselves and thus I grew up suffering their wrath. While growing up, I was afraid that I too would end up being far worse than them since they always seemed to unload everything from me. From their mind games, to their abusive words, to the way they put me down and never once admitted wrong. <br /> <br />Of all of the worst, my father was the most demeaning. It was sort of a jekyll and hyde relationship. He put me down the most, made fun of me the most and seemed to take pride in shredding whatever self-esteem I had. On good days he would seem almost loving, by talking to me, watching basketball games with me and buying me the things I wanted and loved. Yet just as quickly, and without warning, he could tear that all away in an instant. Whenever he chose to. It was very hard to please him. Jumping through endless hoops just wasn't enough, it didn't matter if I succeeded the first 80 times, the 81st would be treated as if it was the end of the world. I was denied the privilidge of going out at nights and doing much of what I wanted until I went away. <br /> <br />The point of all of this, is not to make you feel sorry for my ass but to understand that facing the truth really does hurt. My dad, never really knew what love was - and MORE IMPORTANTLY how to love ME. People need to realize that every individual is different and the way you express it, should never damage a person's self-respect or character.  <br /> <br />The truth hurts, all this time I dreamed that if I made it big, that if I proved myself to his liking, that he would love me and tell me I was special. But it never did work out that way. There would be fault in no matter what I do. And he never would change. Confronting him personally, turned out to be one of the biggest arguments I have ever had, but I am better off for it, because I can see the person he really is and move onto better things. <br /> <br />In the end, I have to say I am better off from reading this book and seeing my parents as the cruel undeserving people they are. The truth hurts but face it squarely and it will set you free...
B00005JLT5|5.0|\\"WTF is wrong with those Nazis?!?!\\". I lost count how many times I said that to myself while watching this film. It blows my mind that this happened not even that long ago and it just makes me so angry that there are still racist people today. Why can't people just realize that we are stronger united because we can learn from all different cultures instead of fearing each other which holds us back! <br />Ok, I'm done ranting...onto the film then =) <br /> <br />I'll admit I put off seeing this film because I wasn't ready for what I thought would be a very sad and heavy movie and while it is that, it is also uplifting, hopeful and beautiful. Roman Polanski shoots this film in a way that is very honest. I didn't feel that he tried to manipulate the way you feel by emphasizing the killings and suffering, he merely shows it to you and lets you decide the way it affects you by showing you only a little bit of reaction from the people in the film. <br />I only recall one scene in which Adrien Brody really cries, he is walking down a lonely street lined with abandoned belongings scattered on the ground. This makes the movie much more poignant and haunting because your reactions are completely your own instead of the actor's and actress's.  <br /> <br />Being a pianist myself I really felt Adrien Brodys anguish when he sat down at the piano but couldn't play it for fear of being discovered. The final piece played in the movie is by Chopin and it was a wonderful choice because it is sad and hopeful at the same time, exactly like this film. <br /> <br />I recommend this movie for all teenagers and adults. Parents should watch this movie with their teens and ask them what they think of racism afterward. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|I've tried every way I can think of to warm up to this thing, but getting through it seems like work. But, try as I might to truly embrace HTDAAB, I must concede that U2 have made their second largely unmemorable record in a row. I think this is a shame, as iPod commercial video and all that stuff. They've switched from constantly getting on base to hitting the occasional home run with many strikouts.  <br /> <br />I imagine that if this album were sent back in time to the band when they were first formed and were still bounding with enthusiasm and creativity they'd call it pretentious and a terrible waste of effort. It's just too mediocre and exists purely because of the nostalgia we still feel for one of the greatest rock bands ever formed. <br /> <br />The worst thing I can say about it is that I can't say that I was impressed with any particular song. In fact, I can't say that I can ultimately distinguish one song from the next as I stop to reflect on them. By the second half of the record, I found myself desperately trying to find something worthwhile to praise, which is always a sign that I'm trying to make the record into something more than it actually is.  <br /> <br />U2 stopped writing standout tracks by ATYCLB, neverthless they really believe this is their best era... The truth is they've managed to make a huge joke out of themselves and their music.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002LFU|4.0|Im giving this album 3.5 stars. This is where my passionate relationship with REM (which sustained me through my miserable high School existence) came to a crashing end. After giving us works of art (yes, art) such as Murmur, Fables of the Reconstruction, Reckoning, Life's Rich Pagent and Document, REM gives us.......this. \\"Green\\" is not a bad album, it has its fair share of quality songs and the production is flawless (you can tell when they become more mianstream by listening to the production on each of their albums). By the time \\"Green\\" was dropped, Michael Stipe's voice was loud and clear on all their albums. No more straining to hear his lyrics. But they started to be heard on the radio waaaaay too much with this album. \\"Green\\" is also the album that had the REM song that I hated more than any other song they ever produced.......\\"Stand.\\" I hate that song. It's so commercial its disquesting. However......\\"Green\\" also has what I consider to be ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL REM songs ever written....\\"You Are The Everything.\\" This is a simple song about taking a road trip. It's so right on target about laying in the back seat and watching the telephone wires go by and the scenery. Everytime I listen to this song, I reminisce about all the road trips I took as a child with my parents....laying in the back seat for HOURS upon HOURS watching the up and down motion on the telephone wires and the scenerey flood by. It's a really beautiful song. Another great song on this album is \\"World Leader Pretend\\" which can be applied today to that moron George W. Bush when Stipe states \\"It's amazing what devices you can sympathize, this is my mistake, let me make it good.\\" Or more fitting \\"This is my world and I am, world leader pretend. This is my life, this is my time. I have been given the freedom to do as i see fit.\\" However, in this song the world leader pretend sees the error of his ways and the power he commands and rectifies the situation by \\"razing the walls that he constructed.\\" Great political song. Anyway....I also dislike the songs 'Pop Song 89' 'Get Up' and 'Turn You Inside Out.' Compared to their other albums, the quality of songs on \\"Green\\" fall short. Way Short. To anyone new to REM, please please please start with \\"Life's Rich Pagent\\" or \\"Document\\" before you move on to this album. I wouldnt want someones first impression of this fantastic group to be this album.
B0002X314C|5.0|I have 4 words to say-\\"Get John Legend's CD!!!!!!! It is awesome, from track #1 to #14. You will not regret it. GO John!!! You have a masterpiece. -Nuff Props to You..........
B00000JCOV|3.0|Slipknot are the most hated and controversial band in the world (well, other than maybe Limp Bizkit), and this is where they first made their mark. First off, just let me address one issue: Slipknot are most certainly NOT death metal. Slipknot dont have the brutal tone and low, guttoral vocals that typically characterize death metal. If you want to hear death metal, I give Cryptopsy, Kataklysm, Bloodbath, Hate Eternal and Amon Amarth my highest recommendations. Please, I beg you- before you call Slipknot death metal again, give those bands a listen. I guarantee itll change your mind.  <br /> <br />Well, I think the reason that so many people hate Slipknot is mainly just for their image. The fact that they wear masks, and also the fact that they have 9 members instead of the usual four or five. Let me just say, you cant judge a band solely by the way they look. True, the whole mask and jump suit thing is really pretty cheesy. But the important thing is the music, and I guarantee several of the people who have written one star reviews have barely heard a second of Slipknots music- but thats not to say that Slipknots music is all that great to begin with. <br /> <br />The music here is pretty heavy. Of course its nowhere near as heavy as any death metal, but it is pretty heavy especially by nu-metal standards. I say nu-metal because Slipknot, in some of their songs like \\"Spit It Out\\" do have a rap influence, and plus the fact that they have 2 DJs. But one thing that does save this album from being a boring, typical nu-metal album is the drumming. Joey Jordison is a very fast and solid drummer. But the rest of the bands leaves alot to be desired. Now, the guitarists in the band actually are pretty talented (although they wouldnt show it until their third album), but the guitars here sound weak and buried, and for the most part are drowned out by the vocals and the turn tables, the same goes for the bass. <br /> <br />Now, Corey Taylor has a pretty good voice. He isnt \\"one of the best metal singers of all time\\" as Ive seen stated several times on this site, but he is pretty solid. His screaming is filled with emotion and anger, and while he has little range in his singing voice, at times his voice can sound pretty haunting. When he does his \\"rap/scream\\" style of vocals he sounds pretty good as well, especially because of the clean/growling transition.  <br /> <br />Overall, if youre a fan of nu-metal thats not extremely impressionable, I would recommend this to you. If youre a person whos extremely into metal and discredits anything to do with nu-metal you obviously wont like this album.
B00005LB9O|5.0|The Invisible Band was the follow up to The Man Who, an album that generated excitement to either side of the pond, and turned Travis, and more importantly Fran Healy, into one of the most recognised (though perhaps not on the street - the reason the album was named The Invisible Band was that no-one recognised them in person) bands in British rock today. The question on everyone's lips at 2001 was if Travis had shaken off the glitter and stars that had burdened them with the success of the previous album. And quite simply, they had.  <br />The Invisible Band saw Travis use more of the banjo (however disgusting that may sound) in hit songs such as 'Sing' and 'Flowers in the Window'. These songs in no way reflect the album in style, as 'Side' proves to be one of the most thought provoking songs lyric-wise, and uses guitars softly and beautifully. As there is with every Indie's rock band, there is a hint of the piano in every song, including upbeats mentioned before. My personal favourite is 'The Cage', with its slightly mellow feel about a forlorn love lost, which has some tear jerking lyrics. Other songs show that Travis are willing to become a more upbeat band than previously thought. <br />Overall, there is a feeling that Travis have developed into a budding, comfortable band, that aren't afraid to do what they want, rather than the band that were horrifically afraid of failiure and shot out slightly sad and depressing songs. They know that they have a cushion if they fall now in rock music, and seem a little more happy about that.  <br /> <br />

B000063UR2|4.0|It's no wonder, because this is fantasy at it's best. It has a nice plot to it and great sets and characters. I think I'll always enjoy this movie because I've always enjoyed fantasy. It's a must-have for any fan of fantasy, adventure, Zelda, romance or Tom Cruise fan. This MUST be a classic. Tom Cruise is the perfect guy to rescue his woman from the clutches of The Lord Of Darkness {played by Tim Curry} with the help of some friendly goblins and a fairy. DADDY'S WORKIN' RIGHT NOW! It's an amazing journey full of suspence and....stuff.
B000001E18|5.0|this was originally meant to be a 4 track e.p. , to be quickly recorded during the zoo t.v. tour...it became a whole album! <br /> <br />It's incredible as to how quickly this was \\"put together\\". Perhaps they had quite a few songs left over from \\"achtung baby\\", perhaps they felt invigorated by the success of the previous album's \\"new direction\\"? Either way, this is where, IMHO, they more or less PERFECTED the prior work's \\"new formula\\". <br /> <br />Some may complain, as there's no \\"obvious\\" hit singles as achtung baby (\\"lemon\\" was briliiant though). But this album for me is much better, as ENO , flood et al, are allowed a lot more freedom to add \\"synth textures\\" such as VCS3 noises, samples et al? <br /> <br />This is an excellent album, from start to finish...everything whizzes by really quickly, which possibly reflects the confidence and speed at which it was put together?  <br /> <br />Beautiful. And \\"pop\\" completed the trilogy..  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001HLVS2|5.0|A true must-see for any wartime & maritime action movie lover! Peter Weir has done an excellent job of bringing Patric O'Brian's masterieces on to the widescreen. Great acting, great special effects and outstanding soundtrack and music! Truth to tell, I watched the movie and then read the Books \\"Master and Commander\\" and \\"Far Side of the World\\" - plus I ordered 3 more books of the series from this site!  <br /> <br />In this movie one can trully experience life onboard a napoleonic  period warship - all the hardships, malnutrition and injuries that the crew faced on a daily basis.  <br /> <br />Ok, it is true that many alterations have been made to the plot for the film version (which is of course an amalgamation of the two books mentioned above) but they are completely understandable for this purpose. <br /> <br />The ending of the film left me wanting more though, and I am looking forward to a part II of this movie! It is without question the best thing after \\"Captain Horatio Hornblower\\" with Gregory Peck.
B00008EY9G|4.0|\\"The silence of the Lambs\\" was the real beginning of this subgenre of memorable pictures like \\"The silence...\\" itself or \\"The sixth sense\\". Some other like \\"12 Monkeys\\" and a lot of them which arised in the late 90's could kill the psycho-thriller movie. <br /> <br />I am pleased to see that this sort of movies regarding to the deep obscure thoughts of ill minds are alive and well. I can even feel the difference between the first and the second of Ripley's movies. The first, with Damon, is mediocre and even boring. The second, with Malkovich, is superb. <br /> <br />This \\"Identity\\" is in the good road, but not the 10 characters which are entrapped in a motor-hotel isolated of all contact by road, by phone or by radio. The series of crimes makes it a decent suspense movie at the beginning, but the irruption of one of the characters in a late night trial, converts the movie in a great psycho-thriller. <br /> <br />Actors are fine. I'm really becoming a Cusack's fan, becuase all his acting is really convincing, but not so much from Liotta. Amanda Peet is also to be acclaimed. <br /> <br />Anyway, I won't say anything else, because it is very important to keep the emotion until the end. Just see it until the end, because the resolution is the best of the movie. As it has to be.
0613599071|5.0|Although the Life of Pi is a little hard to get into (it took me about 75 pages to get hooked) it is worth the time! What a treasure of a book! A sixteen year old boy and his love of religion - quite a surprize. A philisophical surprize that you don't want to miss.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I'm a BIG Linkin Park fan (hence the LP in my screen name) and while it is VERY difficult to say what their best work is (because it is all great), I think Meteora is their best CD to date.  It is hard to articulate specifics about what makes this their best CD.  For a close listener you can hear an almost imperceptible improvement in the overall sound of the music.  To me, the enhancement of the role of Mike Shinoda in this CD is evident.  He is probably the most OVERALL talented member of the band (Chester Bennington is one of the best vocalists in the history of rock and roll).  For someone who had never heard any of LP before, this is the CD I would have them listen to first.       A couple of other things I would like to say.  First of all, you don't need to be under the age of 18 to enjoy Linkin Park.  I am 43 and a HUGE fan.  Second, for those of you that hate them because they are not heavy metal or classic rock, that is like hating them for not being country!  They are what they are.  If you don't like this genre of music, don't listen to it.
B000002KZA|5.0|Construction time again is a testament to Martin Gore's talent as a musician. To review this album properly we should consider first it's two predecessors Speak and Spell (1981) and A Broken Frame (1982.) <br /> <br />Speak and Spell was largely written by Vince Clarke resulting in a collection of masterful pop melodies inlcuding the classic 'Just Can't Get Enough.' Continuing on that trajectory Clarke has written catchy dance tunes since, but never became the talent that Gore is.  <br /> <br />A Broken Frame (1982)was ultimately a transition album for Depeche Mode. The songwriting was muddled and Dave Gahan's singing was second rate. In all fairness this must have been a difficult album to make for Depeche Mode. Without the flair cute pop tunes, the band had to re-establish what they did, and this album proves that. It is certainly an album to own if you are a real fan, otherwise, I would skip it.  <br /> <br />Construction Time Again truly showcases the band's talent and provides a foundation for all that has come after it. In my opinion this album is to Depeche Mode what Dark Side of the Moon was for Pink Floyd. Construction time was that point where it all came together. The songwriting takes on a more serious form. There is plenty of social criticism: 'Pipeline' and 'Everything Counts' criticizes greedy multi-nationals; 'The Landscape is Changing' calls attention to environmental degradation. The moody and serious music style is also evident on this album. <br /> <br />One of their best and definitely worth buying if you are familiar with their 80's albums and want to witness its genesis.
B0006399FS|4.0|Look, I love U2.  I've been a long-time fan ('since the late 80s)  And I had high hopes for this album - I was looking for something new, something profound, but it just wasn't there.  That doesn't mean it's not a good album, it's just not what I've come to expect from U2.  It really says something about how truly good the band is when even at their worst, they are as popular as they are.   <br /> <br />I guess my complaint is that there's no underlying substance or theme to this album.  There are a couple of songs that are great musically and have excellent lyrics (in particular, Love and Peace or Else) but overall, it just doesn't move me.  There's no angst over losing love, no fury over aparthied, no contemplation of the ephemeral nature of life on earth -- what is this album *about*? <br /> <br />Maybe it's just their musings while they're making something better.  I hope so.
0156027321|5.0|the great thing about this book is the levels to which you can take it. yes, it is an adventure story- robinson crusoe and tom hanks and every other misfortunate to master the elements. if that was all this book was, then it would be forgettable as any other amusement park ride, enjoying it while you were on it but  ultimately moving on.  <br /> <br />but it isnt that simple.  <br /> <br />think of this book as a factual acount, as indeed the auther sets out to do. some of these reviews will tell you that the end comes as a slap in the face- and i wont lie to you that i didnt take it at face value myself. and since this slap matched with what i held to be likely, with psycho babble and the imagination of a scientist, i unhappily accepted it as true.  <br /> <br />but then i thought about it. why claim that this book makes you believe in god when the end cuts all ties to the divine?  <br /> <br />thinking back on what pi himself had all spelt out in the beginning of the story, that there is a better story. why would you believe in yeastless factuality? why was i so quick to believe that? because it is simpler to trust in than the fantastic. and once realized, what martel has done is to ask you, <br /> <br /> what are you willing to believe?
B000669GAI|3.0|Pearl Jam has always a guilty plessure for punk and indie fans. <br />Kurt Cobain called them a \\"\\"corporate, alternative and c ock-rock fusion\\"\\" and he was <br />mostly right.There is nothing really \\"Alternative\\" in their sound. <br />What started as a heavy Doors sound soon turned into Neil Young influenced baladry. <br /> <br />So,maybe Pearl Jam ia not Punk in sound but punk in ethics?Well,in Mr Vedders case,I dont know if hanging with celebs and leaving his wife to become a father with a tall young supermodel is \\"Punk ethics\\". <br /> <br />so,Pearl Jam is really just a good dinosaur rock band.These tracks dont have the excitment of Nirvana's With The lights Out.But unless you are a huge fan,it makes more sence to get this then the awful Binaural and Riot Act.The best cuts from thous uninspired sleepwalk-through albums are represented here with all the hits from when they sold much more albums then they do now.  <br /> <br />
B000002KKS|5.0|It's tough to convince an Ozzy worshipper that Black Sabbath continued to put out good albums after he left.  That's all fine and dandy if they don't want to acknowledge this album-Their loss.  Besides Sabbath wasn't Ozzy's band anyway.  I'd always thought it was Geezer and Tony's myself.  Even though I love the Ozzy albums, bear with me while I bash him for a moment.  After Ozzy and his ego left the band, in stepped Dio-Stargazer, rainbow chaser, and all around cool guy.  Dio brought lyrics to the band(which Ozzy really didn't).  He also brought one helluva singing voice which is alot more powerful than Ozzy's \\"I really gotta go pee\\" type vocals.  Dio also had(and has) pretty much all of his brain cells.  I know that there are people out there who don't like Dio in any way, shape or form.  True, Dio's Dio regardless of what band he's in, but if you don't like him, try listening to the music.  The music on Heaven and Hell proves that Sabbath weren't fizzling out.  The album was really a true rebirth after some crappy albums with Ozzy.  Yes, it does sound a bit different.  It's different from Master Of Reality to be sure, but then again, so was Sabotage.  Personally I can find alot of great tunes from all stages of Sabbath's career, I don't limit myself to the Ozzy years, but I also know that to many this is unavoidable.  I'm guilty as well, I can't stand Sammy Hagar era Van Halen.  It's too bad that Dio and Tony locked horns, resulting in Sabbath phase 2 to end too quickly.  We could have heard some more great stuff from this lineup.  At least they managed to cough out Dehumanizer.
B00006M183|1.0|The best band of the 90's really hit rock-bottom in the 2000's,and Riot Act is Pearl Jam's worst. <br /> <br />Here are some reasons why I hated Riot Act: <br /> <br />1.The Music <br />what happened to all thous great riffs on past albums?The great <br />choruses?Lot of time there is no melodies. <br />2.Vedder's vocals. <br />what happened to the emotion in his voice?He sounds tired and bored. <br />3.The Lyrics. <br />Vedder's lyrics have become extremely hit and miss lines from poems that just sound like toss off lines and often contradict one another.Also-the whole band writing lyrics makes this album lack one voice even more. <br />4.The Production <br />The \\"Live\\" sound just sounds really sloppy <br /> <br />
B00008QSAA|5.0|Samhot'll give you a much better play by play of this album than me, but I'm here to be yet another voice to tell you to quit screwin' around and just buy this album.  Every man, woman and child has heard \\"Mississippi Queen\\" since it appears on every classic rock compilation from here to De-friggin-Troit, but have you heard the other songs contained herein?  While Mississippi Queen is a frickin heavy, rockin' song, you're cheating yourself by not hearing all that Climbing! has to offer.  I seriously can't find one song on this damn cd I don't like.  I only had to listen to it twice to really get into it.  I wasn't all that crazy about the slower songs the first time around, but that changed awfully quick and now they're probably my favorite on the album.  Leslie West is not only a great guitar player(lets hope he gets his due someday), but has some of the best vocals to be heard in a classic rock band.  If you into 70s hard rock, buying Climbing! isn't a gamble, it's a guaranteed winner.  You get this and it's gonna spend an awful lot of time in your cd player.  And you can take that to the bank!
B000000W5P|5.0|This was The Stones best album outside of their brilliant 1968-1972 era. 1978 was the glory days of disco and the Stones responded with \\"Miss You\\" featuring a blazing sax solo from King Crimson alumni Mel Collins. 1978 was also the advent of the punk rock movement and the Stones toughened up their sound with \\"Respectable\\", \\"Lies\\", \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\" and one of my favorites \\"Shattered\\" which allowed Mick Jagger to really strut his stuff. Two of my other all-time favorite Stones songs can be found on this album...the sarcastic countryish \\"Far Away Eyes\\" and the classic ballad \\"Beast of Burden\\" which has nicely held up in spite of its overexposure from radio. Charlie Watts has never sounded better than his crisp sounding drums on this release.    <br /> <br />Other personal faves are a slinky cover of The Temptations' \\"Just My Imagination\\" and the controversial \\"Some Girls\\" which was called to task for pigeon-holing the fairer sex. Mick sounds great singing back-up vocals alongside his lead vocals. And of course, Keith gets his one song...a good one with \\"Before They Make Me Run\\". This re-release is digitally remastered but unfortunately you don't get the classic original cover with Raquel Welch, Lucy Ball and Farrah Fawcett.   <br />
0060934719|5.0|Neil Gaiman's *Stardust* chronicles the origin and life of the young Englishman Tristran Thorn, in particular his quest to retrieve, for the woman he fancies, a star that has fallen in the land of Faerie, which begins just beyond his village of Wall.  But Tristran isn't the only one who seeks the star, and the star itself is much more than he imagined ...<br /><br />Gaiman weaves a quickly paced, beautifully structured adult fairy tale--'adult' because it doesn't neglect the human experiences of sex, death and time.  His language is that of the gifted storyteller--clear, concise and lyrical, resonant with mythic lore and archetypes.  I highly recommend this book (even as a new purchase) for fans of fantasy, fairy tales, mythology, and/or romance, as well as for those who simply enjoy a well-told tale.<br /><br />It would be a disservice to an interested reader to make this review any longer.  Do read this one.  Five enchanting stars.
0684859106|5.0|Ever since I purchased the Magnolia Bakery Cookbook, my friends and family have come to refer to me as the cheesecake goddess.  There are several cheesecake recipes in the book and many of them lend for minor changes to make wonderful tastes to call your own.  I have yet to master the crumb topped cheescake which is the piece de'resistance of this cookbook.  It's close to the real thing, but I guess some things are just better left to the masters.  Enjoy this book as you too will be the talk of family parties and pot lucks. <br />
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Who are the kings of speed metal?  Metallica?  Don't make me laugh.  After listening to this album, the answer is clear - MEGADETH. <br />When Metallica were starting to make mainstream pussy metal, Megadeth were about to unleash a furious assault on the world.  That assault was called RUST IN PEACE.  Upon hearing the album, most metal fans were convinced - Megadeth had surpassed Selloutica.   <br />This album is just monstrous energy from beginning to end.  It's also the first album from the classic lineup of Mustaine, Friedman, Ellefson and Menza.  This remains perhaps the finest speed metal album ever made, definitely up there with any of Metallica's first three albums.   <br /> <br />\\"Holy Wars\\" is awesome, carrying on the tradition of anti-war metal songs like \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" and \\"2 Minutes To Midnight\\".  Likewise, \\"Hangar 18\\" is a solid slice of metal perfection, highlight by the mind-boggling shredding of Marty Friedman during the final solos.  Just listen to that and tell me that Kirk Hammett is better.  I dare you.  What Marty does here is friggin' unbelievable.  I don't know if anyone else can out-shred that guy. <br />And things get REALLY good with \\"Take No Prisoners\\".  A motherf---er of a song, with thunderous riffs, great lyrics and those awesome chants of \\"Infiltrate them!  Devastate them!...\\"  The lyrics to \\"Five Magics\\" owe a lot to Iron Maiden.  Great song.  \\"Poison Was The Cure\\" is vicious, but Mustaine snarls the lyrics so quickly that you can't understand one word he's saying.  \\"Lucretia\\" is the only average song on the album.  \\"Tornado Of Souls\\" is one of the best tunes they've ever done.  What a brilliant vocal melody!  \\"Dawn Patrol\\" is kind of puzzling.  It's sung with a British accent and only lasts about a minute and a half.  But then we have the title track.  Probably the best song on the album, and a heavy metal masterpiece.  Love the lyrics.   <br /> <br />The bonus demos are nothing special.  But the sound quality on this remaster is phenomenal.  I have the original edition of COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION and the sound is lifeless and flat.  If all the remasters sound like this, then I'm sure as hell gonna buy them all! <br /> <br />Long live Megadeth.  Long pity Metallica.
B00008LOS1|5.0|Actually, this set is worth the price alone for each of the songs Love Aint for Keeping, Pure & Easy, Getting in Tune, Naked Eye, & Water, which overpower just about everything from Live at Leeds.  On these five songs it seems like Roger Daltrey's voice rises to the level of the other 3 guys he was playing with making them sound really special.  The only song I didn't really care for was \\"Don't Get Fooled Again\\" which I think sounds much better on the \\"who's next\\" album and other live versions.  Keith Moon's drumming is unbelievable on  Young Man's Blues, and the entire concert for that matter.  I don't think \\"Live at Leeds\\" had any weak or average songs, and this only has one but I would still rate this live set higher  with Moon's extra-savage drumming tipping the scale.  That means you should buy the cd.
B0006284JQ|5.0|OK, first of all, I'm not a fan of Britney Spears.  I'm giving this CD five stars just to help raise the overall rating.   In fact, during her 1998-2002 heyday, I was annoyed by her popularity.  The only way to escape the hype about Britney Spears was to not listen to the radio or watch TV.  If it were still 2000, I'd have given this CD one star.  I used to think that no singer could ever be worse than Britney Spears.    However, Britney's music career has since been destroyed, and a slippery, oily, greasy dirtball, who rides a skateboard and dresses in oversized baggy clothing has taken her place.     Avril Lavigne is a \\"tomboy\\" from Napanee, Ontario who \\"plays the guitar and writes her own songs\\".  Whee!    The media, using every @ss-kissing compliment imaginable, praise and worship the hideous, oil-covered slob, and will try their damndest, through a long list of impressive facts and sales figures to explain why they have destroyed somebody else's music career, and let a whiney teenager who doesn't bathe take her place.    If you ever get a chance to attend an Avril Lavigne concert, please hiss and boo, and act as any musically concerned person would.  Avril is the worst thing that has EVER happened to popular music.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|My 16 yr old son asked me to buy him this movie, I thought it would suck!   But after watching it, I fell in love with all the nostalgia!  Awesome flick, it brought back some memories and was so stupid and hilarious at the same time!  Highly recommended! <br /> <br />
6305181810|4.0|I greatly enjoyed the Rainmaker and have seen it numerous times. I must say however, that one of the reasons I like it so much is that it is so similar to the Verdict starring Paul Newman from 1982, which I loved. I am honestly surprised that there were no lawsuits regarding the two films, as I see simply names changed, characters made older or younger, etc. Matt Damon plays young, naive Rudy Baylor, a lawyer with no experience. Newman plays Frank Galvin, burnt-out alcoholic lawyer. Danny Devito plays the Jack Warden role. One case focuses upon a boy stricken with leukemia in which the insurance company will not cover a bone marrow transplant. The other film's focus is upon a woman who enters a hospital to give birth and is given the wrong anesthetic. The surprise witnesses are similar too. And the verdict in both films is extremely similar with both juries asking to be allowed to increase the monies awarded. Mr. Grisham probably thought that no one would notice 15 years later. Most didn't notice. I did.
6305127697|3.0|Primal Fear is one of those movies you must see regardless whether or not you are a Richard Gere fan. Why? Simply because of Edward Norton's character. Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a big shot attorney who defends Norton for free just so he can get some big time public recognition even though he already has it. Laura Linney is the prosecutor who also happens to be Vail's ex-girlfriend. Despite the story being interesting from start to finish, there is a big twist in the end due to the talented acting by Edward Norton. Now onto the DVD... Though the film is presented in widescreen, the bottom portion of the picture is cropped. This is not a huge problem if you have a widescreen TV yet is still very noticable. Aside from that, there are no special features (I don't consider theatrical trailers to be a special feature). I would have very much liked to have seen interviews with Richard Gere, Laura Linney, and of course Edward Norton. If you have a VHS, don't bother replacing it with the DVD unless it is completely worn out.
B0000DBJDL|5.0|This is a great DVD of a great performance. Good sound, good picture, and nice new additions in the Director's Cut. It all adds up to a very Floydian experience. Sit back and enjoy the trip.<br />I've seen the original on the big screen at the theater and owned the VHS. I'm very happy with the Director's Cut DVD on my Sony Wega, very clear picture given the concert is thirty years old. The intro, though not original to the film, is clean and clear and is nicely done. The extra footage is a bonus.<br />If you are a Floyd fan (I've seen them live three times and own every album and many, many bootlegs), this is a must-own DVD. There are really no lowpoints on this DVD. The music and footage are wonderful!
B0000BYM3K|2.0|The album is boring and repetitive, with the exception of Dance of Death and The Journeyman.  For the last two albums, IM has used a writing style of repetition.  It's pretty annoying when they repeat the same line ten times in a row.  That's how they get their songs to eight minutes.  DoD and The Journeyman are excellent.  One is a pretty intricate piece that shows that Nicko can still drum.  The Journeyman is an acoustic affair and their best one since Drifter. <br /> <br />Buy the album, but it's not worth more than a discounted price or used.  Buy all the albums up to Fear of the Dark and you'll be happy.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I have been waiting for years to see Jamie Foxx take his rightful place in the pantheon of great American performers. He is a gifted actor, funny-man ( who can forget the I'm gonna rock your world lady from \\" In Living Color \\" ) and a very skilled musician. In \\" On Any Given Sunday \\" Foxx showed the movie viewing public that he could deliver a first rate, solid dramatic performance. I also have to admit to loving \\" Booty Call \\". <br /> <br />Cruise has always been a bit of a problem for me. I have disliked many of his films; particularly those projects where he has been a producer. I have found that there is a limit to how many shots of his hair, smile and steely gaze that I can stand. I include \\" The Last Samurai \\" as one of the worst big productions of all time. Still... he was wonderful in \\" Rain Man \\" and I thoroughly enjoyed his work in \\" Minority Report \\". However I have always believed that he has done his sincere best and is capable of great generosity with his fellow performers. <br /> <br />In \\" Collateral \\" Cruise intelligently takes a step back and lets Foxx shine. His performance as a professional killer is nuanced, and well developed. It would have been so easy to overplay his hand and start chewing scenery, but instead, he has shown an intense restraint that is very powerful, and creates the room that Foxx needs to leave his imprint on this film. <br /> <br />Foxx has established, once and for all, that he can hold the screen as a lead in a big time, big budget movie. He puts all of his wide range of dramatic and comedic to superb use. In numerous scenes he subtly uses his eyes alone to described shifts in his thinking and moods. He also has demonstrated that special ability to merge so thoroughly with his role. that it is easy to forget that it's Jamie Foxx on the screen. <br /> <br />The films plot move at a quick pace, but not so fast that there isn't time allowed for scenes and moods to be well established. The overall casting is perfect. The movie is beautifully filmed. The direction is first rate without being overbearing. <br /> <br />Jada Pinkett Smith also shines as a Federal prosecutor. I swear she grows lovelier with each passing year, and her screen presence and acting ability have followed a pace. <br /> <br />I would be remiss if I didn't mention the contribution to this film of Irma P. Hall. She came to acting late in life and brings her wisdom and life experience to every role she plays. She is an American treasure! <br /> <br />This is a first rate action thriller. Don't miss it!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I did not watch Napoleon Dynamite until it came out on DVD. The first words out of Napoleon's mouth in response to a question about what he's going to do that day were, \\"I'll do whatever I want to do. Gosh!\\" Then he proceeds to throw an action figure out the window of the school bus tied to a piece of string. My brothers-in-law who had already seen the movie repeated the line and then all started laughing hysterically when he threw the GI Joe out the window. I said to myself, \\"This is stupid.\\" My wife muttered to me, \\"I can't believe we're wasting out time watching this.\\"<br /><br />Then you start to realize that the stupider the movie got, the funnier everybody who had seen it thought it was. By about twenty minutes in, I started laughing out loud. By the end of the DVD, I started watching it again and found myself repeated the lines. Now, three weeks later, I find that Napoleon Dynamite's \\"dorky,\\" \\"geeky,\\" \\"nerdy,\\" and all the other adjectives that reviewers have used to describe him have become part of my vocabulary. My wife and I regularly find ourselves responding to each other like Pedro, \\"Yes,\\" \\"No,\\" \\"Build her a cake or something,\\" and \\"Is she hot?\\" We mutter, \\"Idiot,\\" \\"Freakin' idiot,\\" \\"Lucky,\\" Gosh,\\" \\"This is pretty much the worst video ever made,\\"  \\"What kind of gun did you use; A freakin' 12 gauge, what do you think?\\" \\"I already made like infinity of those,\\" \\"I see you're drinking 1%. Is that 'cause you think you're fat? Because you're not. You could be drinking whole if you wanted to,\\" \\"I'm so T.O. [ticked off]\\", \\"Sweet,\\" \\"Yessss...\\" \\"\\"Come get your dinner you fat lard,\\" \\"My lips hurt real bad,\\" and many others.<br /><br />This movie is great because it really is a waste of time and is a story about nothing and the producers acknowledge it. There is nothing amazing about the cinematography; the amateurishness of it adds to the humor. This has already become a cult classic for good reason. It's popularity will only grow. This is certainly one of my favorite movies I've ever seen, although I'm not sure I could ever describe to you the reason why.avorite movies I've ever seen, although I'm not sure I could ever describe to you the reason why.
0316172324|4.0|I often hear an interview with an author or read a review of a book that sounds terrific, only to learn when I read the book that I learned about all I need to know from the interview or review. Unfortunately BLINK fits that category although Mr. Gladwell does make some interesting observations that fall into the sad, the fascinating and the obvious.<br /><br /> It is sad, for instance, that in the year 2005 we are still programmed by racial stereotypes when we blink. The shooting of Amadou Diallo is an unfortunate example. Police officers see a small black man on the street after midnight in a bad neighborhood in the Bronx. When they drive by him he does not run. Then he finally runs, attempting to get into his apartment and reaches for somethig that turns out to be a billfold. We know how this incident ended. Mr. Gladwell goes into great detail to explain all the mistakes that the polices officers made. For instance, if they had paid attention to his face they would have seen that he was frightened rather than dangerous. It is incredibly sad that in an experiment where black college students, when given twenty questions taken from the GRE, the standardized test for admission to graduate school, if asked to state their race on a pretest questionnaire, the number of questions they would get correct is cut in half, they are so programmed by negative racial stereotypes. (Congressman John Lewis has spoken out recently on racial profiling at airports.)<br /><br /> Some of Mr. Gladwell's facts are fascinating. Shoppers will pay more for the same amount of ice cream if it is packaged in a round rather than a rectangular container, for instance. Then there is the Pepsi v. Coke taste test. Fanatics swear they can tell the difference, and many drinkers can. However, if you do the triangle test, where you put the same cola in two glasses and the other in the third glass and ask a thousand samplers to tell you which two colas are the same, only about a third of the testers gets it right. That, according to the author, is not much better than chance, so we might as well guess.<br /><br /> Many of the author's observations and conclusions are obvious: what he calls the Warren Harding error-- that we often vote for attractive political candidates regardless of their qualifications; and that tall white men get promoted over black men, white women, black women and short white men; and that blinking or \\"thin slicing\\" is more accurate if it involves something we care about and are good at, i.e., we have experience in the area. He gives example after example of this: the psychologist who through years of study can predict from a short interview with a young couple- even if they are just discussing a pet-- if they will get a divorce down the road; the art critic who spotted an expensive fake immediately because she had studied ancient sculptures, the seasoned tennis pro who can predict when tennis players will miss their second serve.<br /><br /> The Seventeenth Century philosopher Pascal is way ahead of Mr. Gladwell since he said something similar a long time ago: chance favors the prepared mind., according to the author, is not much better than chance, so we might as well guess.

0792164903|5.0|I usually hate thrillers but this one just caught my attention and i thought why not give it a try. <br /> it is just great!!! a great performance by johnny depp and christina ricci, a great story and all done by a great director.  <br /> i recommend this one to everyone!
B0006MT314|5.0|This is the best television soundtrack in a long time.  The best song is \\"When the Stars Go Blue\\" by Tyler Hilton and Bethany Joy Lenz.  With just that song, this CD is definitely a must buy!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is not meant to be a straight-up horror movie!  It's a combination of hypothetical disaster, social commentary, and action.  Yes, it's easy to take on the zombies in the middle of the movie.  It's MORE CRUEL to make you believe the characters can make it before pulling the rug back from under your expectations again (most movies are just low to high or vice versa; this one is low then high then back to low again).  The remake is scarier in the movie, but this one is much scarier after you think about it.  Unsympathetic characters?  Of course they are, it's after the Big One, the Apocalypse.  How many of us would be Good Samaritans in these circumstances?  I think most of those who don't like the movie aren't truly immersing themselves in the situation; there's nothing compassionate or glamorous about humanity after the fall.  And besides, wouldn't fast and able zombies not be caricatures of mallgoers?   <br />I could keep going on.  When I talk with people face to face, I've had good arguments about this movie.  But, so far, none of the bad reviews I've seen online have made any sense or at least show a profound ignorance of the circumstances surrounding the movie's production, the time period, and/or the complexities of the narrative.
B0002X314C|5.0|This is by far one of the most fresh CD's I've heard in awhile. This guy has TALENT people. He has a beautiful voice. R. Kelly has a nice voice too, but this guy outshines the pied piper in every way, in terms of voice and mostly production. <br /> <br />The songs are so catchy. 'Number One' will simply put you in a good mood just listening to it, and Kanye West makes the track even better.  <br /> <br />All of the other tracks are great too. Trust me. You will LOVE this CD.
B0006GAOCW|4.0|this was a fantastic movie too watch. and i could see that katie holmes really rocks from this movie.
B00029LNHS|3.0|I just had to throw something up to respond to the last post. I've been down with bep since 97 and your comment of Fergie having a great voice.... PLEAZ! See em live and you will realize it's all studio magic. She's a second place to Ashlee Simpson for worst female vocalist. Sorry kids, but this record is only hot because of the tracks the boys spit on. It's hard to love these guys now that they have gone so huge and record pop songs. From a producer standpoint....slickest record they have recorded. I'd like to get a copy that has all of her vocals removed!
0316172324|1.0|Perhaps it is simply ironic that so many pages are devoted to explaining something that happens instantaneously, yet still manages to miss the target. A disappointing book on a subject that should have been fasinating to write about and read. It is telling that that word \\"instinct\\" is nowhere to be found in the index of the book.
B000002UE9|1.0|Hairspray,Spandex,makeup and a goofy guitar player. Sounds like a recipe for disaster to me.  Take the worst parts of Alice Cooper,The Worst parts of Kiss add some average muscicians and trite song writing and you get Poison. God how I wish the 80's would just go away.......
630469878X|1.0|I FINALLY watched this to see why this movie caused so much commotion. Well, perhaps it was because it was the first time women were portrayed as being equally moronic as men in the cinema  but to call this a \\"feminist\\" movie should make the feminists complain even louder than they already do. Susan Sarandon (who somehow always remains brilliant in any role in spite of her radical anti-American politics) does her best to salvage this mess... and mental myopic Geena Davis (one of the world's worst actresses) mostly plays herself (a ditzy, chicken-brained, witless, woozy for sure). In addition to the heavy-handed, rampant, anti-male bashing throughout this film, these woman are also portrayed as poor, woe-is-me victims from the start.<br /><br />Who could have any sympathy for these imbecilic, confused, blundering women?  Life \\"happened\\" to them... in their foggy confused stupor of an existence... and suddenly they take charge and are alive and empowered only after crossing the line into being murderers, fugitives and gun-toting criminals?  Not even elementary good drama here, folks. They never grow, learn or transform... but just change from dumb victims to dumber outlaws.<br /><br />If this is what people consider a \\"cult classic,\\" I would be tempted to ask of which cult they are a member.<br /><br />The best moment of the film was the ending. Truthfully, I was deeply relieved and amused when it was finally over and couldn't wait for them to drive off the cliff and save the gene pool for future generations.
B0000508U6|5.0|I really love Coldplay. They are one of my favorite bands. And for those who rate this low, you need to listen and be open to different kinds of music!
B0002S94OS|5.0|With Ashes of the Wake, Lamb of God have managed to do the unthinkable, get better at what they do best.  Both As The Palaces Burn and New American Gospel solidified this band's reputation as one of the most talented and intricate metal bands ever, but Ashes just broke the bar they had set themselves anyways.  With Ashes they've focused the rhythm, and the singer has found his vocal equilibrium, without losing one shred of his trademarked growl.  Through 11 songs, they hold back nothing, and the guitar work is as finely detailed and complex as ever, along with every other instrument.  Standing at the top of a metaphorical mountain, Lamb of God still managed to step up their playing and overall performance.  Though I'd truly recommend the whole album, I personally love \\"Omerta\\", the single \\"Laid to Rest\\", and the instrumental guitar showcase \\"Ashes of the Wake\\", which featured a guest guitarist from testament.  Any guitarist could listen to \\"Ashes...\\" and drop their jaw for a solid 3 or 4 minutes.  Bottom line, I recommend this album to anyone that likes metal, period.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I really liked this album of Gren Day's. Some people say that it wasn't very good but I loved it. I liked it so much that I baught the guitar book for it and now I can play most of the songs on it. I don't think I have a favorite song because I like all of the songs really. Top three would be...  <br />1.)Minority: a catchy song that basicly talks about rebeling against the authority. It has lyrics just a few seconds after it starts. It has an interesting begining with the, I wanna say elavater music, in the begining, then it goes to the actual song w/ guitars and bass and drums etc. and billy joe starts to sing right off. I like how they put the chorus in the very begining too.  <br />2.)Misery: I liked this song. Some people said it sucked but I think it is different from all the other songs Green Day has made. It is basically talking about how all these people has crapy lives and some of them die and they are all connected to each other. But I like the whole greekish mannor about it. That is what it sounds like to me. I liked it enough to learn it anyway. <br />last but sertainly not least.... <br />3.) Hold on: This is a really good song, to me, and I like the harmonica right off in the begining. The end is good too. not much to say but I just really liked it!
B00011D1RC|2.0|I've seen this movie several times, and have always hated it. I don't know why - I love old movies, but I find this one impossible. Garbo is simply bad - incredible histrionics and inexplicable gyrations and shakes of the shoulders which I'm sure were meant to demonstrate her character as a ballerina, but which look only odd to the modern viewer. The whole film is stilted and shallow. The only other \\"classic film\\" I've ever come away from feeling shafted by was \\"Mrs. Miniver\\" for, I think, similar reasons. I think the modern viewer is simply incapable of viewing these movies in the spirit in which they were intended.
B00005JN4O|5.0|Finding Neverland is a movie that will warm your heart, bring a tear to your eye and leave you glad you went to see it.  I was sceptical when I went but left very satisfied.  Although I have yet to see every top movie nominated for GGs or AAs this year this one would rank as the best so far.
B00009Z574|5.0|If you are open to YES' music and have really loved their previous albums, this diverse album should appeal to you as well. There are no clowns on here song-wise, this is musical sustenance, not candyfloss! The band is drawing from the wide-ranging talents of the band (and in an impressive way) without trying to slay you with virtuosity. It is a song-oriented approach (like Fragile) meant to give all members a chance to shine.<br /><br />Read the lyrics as you listen to the songs. What a collection of compelling, heartfelt songs. They are all good. By the way, I for one think \\"Circus of Heaven\\" is one of the best songs on this release. Haunting and beautiful, the imagery is great and the melody and instrumentation are classic, soaring YES! Have you heard this played in concert? One of the favorites at the 'concert in the round' tour years. I saw them a few times then, that may be why this has a great impact on me. Jon is a little more \\"new age\\" and political than on some before, but I think that makes the album more interesting.<br /><br />Future Times, Rejoice, Arriving UFO, and Madrigal are great songs about our greater connection to the universe played brilliantly. Madrigal is one of the more beautiful songs I have ever heard - Wakeman channels an ancient vibe with the harpsichord, the storytelling and vocal presentation by Jon is inspiring, with harmony/bass pedals by Squire, White takes a subtle role with bells,crotales and cymbals ... and the guitar by Howe is masterful (I'm a guitar player - try working on these chops!). How many bands have been this creative in soundscaping a piece? Strong statements in every way of the interests and talents of the band members.<br /><br />And for the more rockin' songs: Don't Kill the Whale is a wonderful expression of humanities higher purpose with regard to the environment and stewardship of this planet, whales were getting some lousy treatment then. I am glad a band I love could speak out effectively; this was a top ten hit in England, I believe. Rock solid song if you ask me and Howe's guitar blazes a new trail for a pop song. Release, Release is a great rocker (one of their funnest songs) which highlights the energy and concert power of the band and furthers the band ethos as well (\\"no controllers\\"). The Steve Howe guitars sound really cool in this piece (using an old Broadcaster). I believe all lovers of YES in the seventies must get a thrill from the classic sound of On the Silent Wings of Freedom. Driving, melodic, classic Squire bass and trippy Howe power runs. Again, the message of the song is classic idealistic wonderful YES material.<br /><br />I don't know where the criticism comes from. This is YES at a high point in my opinion and those of you who can't stand it - well, you must not have the YES feelin' in your bones. Sorry for the rant but I have to defend this fantastic piece of music so other seekers of quality music don't pass this by. Give it a chance. Crank it up. Open up! Fun collection of extras as well that really enhance this package! Thanks for considering my thoughts. And thanks to YES for all of the memories. P.S. Not all YES has to imitate Relayer or Close to the edge, they were great in their own way and so is this!ieve. Rock solid song if you ask me and Howe's guitar blazes a new trail for a pop song. Release, Release is a great rocker (one of their funnest songs) which highlights the energy and concert power of the band and furthers the band ethos as well (\\"no controllers\\"). The Steve Howe guitars sound really cool in this piece (using an old Broadcaster). I believe all lovers of YES in the seventies must get a thrill from the classic sound of On the Silent Wings of Freedom. Driving, melodic, classic Squire bass and trippy Howe power runs. Again, the message of the song is classic idealistic wonderful YES material.     I don't know where the criticism comes from. This is YES at a high point in my opinion and those of you who can't stand it - well, you must not have the YES feelin' in your bones.

B0002Z0EYK|4.0|This impressive looking production is long on action, special effects and beautiful male bodies but is just plain awful when it comes to story.  The Gods are surely NOT smiling.  It's like the Aaron Spelling version of the Trojan War.  \\"The Silly-iad.\\"<br /><br />That said, TROY remains a heckuva fun way to spend a couple hours if you go in for epic matinee thrill rides.  It's just too bad Paris and Helen have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever...if they did, you could almost understand why a war was waged.  And Achilles's love interest directly feeds the warped notion that prisoners should fall in love with their captors.  Brad Pitt as Achilles is earnest and physically impressive, but he and the kid playing his lookalike cousin still seem like they walked onto the set straight from the Santa Monica pier.  Bana is much more in command of his role as warrior prince.  Poor Peter O'Toole as Priam turns in the second worst performance of his career (Did you ever see SUPERGIRL?).<br /><br />The DVD special features are lots of fun.  Too bad they couldn't have had some knowledgeable historian from the A&E Network do a commentary track to go along with it...would have been interesting to have that perspective.<br /><br />A feast for the eyes.  Just hit the mute button and enjoy.
B00005JNEW|2.0|This movie is the worst!!!  First of all, the plot is almost the exact same as Varsity Blues (a GREAT movie about Texas football, and it's funny instead of all weird and depressing): There's the fallen hero, the kid who never played but then stepped up to glory, the depressed player, and the kid who's just good and helps the team a lot.  I could also compare it to Bring It On, with the whole black team vs. \\"white\\" (even though their team was incredibly diverse, it was still the white team, don't ask me why) team thing here.  I swear whoever wrote this movie memorized Varsity Blues, but I guess they couldn't have if this is a \\"true\\" story.  After reading other posts about the inaccuracies about the movie, it's even worse; they didn't even make it to the championship!  Why did they even make a movie about this crappy team anyway?  Only one of them ever did anything with his life; the rest still live in that town (or closeby to be by his mommy).  Also, Billy Bob Thorton is cruddy in the movie, as the most uninspiring knuckleheaded coach EVER.  His speech about perfection at the end of the movie almost made me want to spew chunks, but I won't ruin the ending for anyone.  The best thing I liked about the movie was its production, because it was creative and original.  But besides that, I yawned a lot and ended up being mad at the end and went off on some rant about it.  Ugh.  There are other football movies that KILL this one, i.e. Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans...so go get those instead.  Also, if it's so \\"impacting\\" to make a movie about a team like this, then they should probably make a movie about every team that ever lost in the semifinal or state championship with an injured star player.  This movie is so weak.
B0000214F3|5.0|It really is a great pity this film didn't do better at the box office.  It honestly is a great movie - and I say that as a man not usually fond of films that might be considered \\"chick flicks\\".  Yes, it is long, but that just means it's not a movie for people with short attention spans.  The length of the movie really doesn't hurt, and in fact, is necessary to flesh out the characters properly.  The acting is superb; the characters seem like real people.  Any film with Anthony Hopkins is worth watching, just to see one of the most gifted actors since Olivier perform.  Brad Pitt manages to hold his own in such exalted company.  And Claire Forlani is simply radiant as the leading actress.<br /><br />Perhaps what I liked best about this movie though, is that despite its length, it evoked the films of the 1930s, which I love.  It's a beautifully filmed movie about high class, wealthy, elegant people of sophisticated tastes and sensibilities (and which shows them as decent people nonetheless, and with problems and issues most people can relate to) - the kind of film that was very popular fare during the years of the Great Depression, but unfortunately the kind of film that hasn't been made for decades.  For me, it was a nostalgic and wonderful throwback to an era of much greater elegance and refinement than today, when people liked to aspire to greater things, rather than being content to reduce things to the lowest common denominator.  I loved it.
B000286S8S|3.0|First off, this album has some pretty damn good material on it and the album cover and story book inside is great too. But its not the best of Van Halen. Stat-wise yes, but I mean come on where's some of the other great stuff like Hear About it Later, Romeo Delight, Mean Street, Drop Dead Legs, 5150, Source of Infection, Light Up the Sky, Dont Tell Me (What Love Can Do), Ice Cream Man, I'm the One, Humans Being, and etc. Thoses are some of the best and need to be on the album as well. Take off those love ballads like When It's Love, Not Enough, Love Walks Out, Can't Stop Loving You because Why Can't this be Love holds that title rightfully and you can take the three songs from Live Right Here, Right Now off and throw on some of the songs I mentioned. If your a newbie to Van Halen definitely buy this album because it covers the top of Van Halen and could get you into and all over them. Still, its a great album and i got it on the day it came out back in July waiting for Best Buy to open that morning. Lol! And I think it's time for some new material cuz Sammy is back and their tour is over! Van Halen rules!! <br /> <br />P.S: Whats up with the ending of Finish What Ya Started? It just cuts right off instead of fading away.

0312995423|3.0|If you aren't that technically savvy and just want a suspenseful plotline, this book might do it for you. In Digital Fortress an expensive code-breaking computer owned by the NSA is under threat of an outside attack. A group of NSA employees are trying to save it, but some have agendas which are less than straightforward.    Dan Brown's writing keeps the reader wondering--how will the heroine/hero escape this time? What will happen next?    Brown's mastery of suspense was not enough, however, to overcome huge plot flaws which made it unbelievable for me. I will try to elaborate on a few which don't give away too much plot:    1. Passwords were compromised when an employee took equipment home and doctored them. Reality: Employees at this high level of security don't get to take ANYTHING home, including work (in another part of the book Brown says one of the characters took work home, too). They line up at the end of the day and are searched before they leave the premises.    2. The main character has 5-character password to her computer station. Reality: Most security professionals recommend an 8- to 10-character password for us average folk. I don't know what the NSA minimum is, but it's certainly not 5.    The climax at the end...well, let's just say it could never happen.    These plot flaws plus some cliche ending events took a lot of the punch out of the book for me. If you have a strong power to suspend disbelief or aren't a geek like me, you might enjoy it.
0451527046|4.0|The book Treasure Island is an adventure book, and for good reasons. This action packed story takes place hundreds of years ago and the setting goes from a dangerous home, to the sea, and finally to an island. In the story Jim Hawkins finds a treasure map and he says in the book that he will try to get the treasure. The main characters are Jim Hawkins, the young lad pursuing treasure, Long John Silver, the experienced sailor who is the cook, and one of the bad guys blind Pew. This is a book that kids would like but is probably recommended for older people due to its reading difficulty. The sailors and Jim Hawkins try to find an island with buried treasure but first they must overcome many treacherous obstacles. The reason this book blows away the competition is because you will always wonder what will happen on the open seas were rules hardly apply. I cannot be sure of the way sailors used to talk but from what I know the author rights it exactly as it would have been said. The reviewers say, \\"masterfully crafted\\" which is only one of many phrases that can portray the excellence of the book. You have to read this slowly, page by page because it has a lot of information on each page and if you read it to quickly you won't understand what just happened. This is not a book you can read right before bed because it's hard to put it down and you might end up reading all night. This book is like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter because people are out to kill you and this book shows many scenes were the characters make narrow escapes, but sometimes they don't. When you read this book you wonder is like a mix of fiction, non- fiction, and science fiction because the adventures are so detailed you might think you are there but it has many surprising scenes that you wonder if that could happen. Although the author has a slow pace it shows every last repetitive thing you have to do at sea. The author also is good at making it feel real, like you are really there. In away thisbook is like Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate where at the very beginning the characters are pretty happy but then someone comes and ruins it then that person keeps going at the people for the money that is rightfully theirs. Basically what I have been saying about Treasure Island is that you should read it. <br /> <br />-Kyle Watson        <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|No matter what the negative reviews say, the fact that over 700 people have bothered to write one indicates to me that this band is perhaps the single most influential and significant pop culture entity on the planet today. <br /> <br />The fact that they can continue to collaborate, compose, perform and deliver under that kind of pressure is nothing short of miraculous, and I think that all the people out there who are pissed that their music doesn't sound teenage and angry anymore should start their own angry, teenage-sounding bands and stop beating up on this one. <br /> <br />Martin Luther King, M.K. Gandhi, Malcolm X, Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix, Keith Moon, Jerry Garcia, Woody Guthrie, Elvis Presley, John Lennon and Joey Ramone are all dead.  Muhammed Ali is alive, but almost silenced. U2 is very much alive and highly audible and for that we should all be deeply, deeply thankful.  The world would be a darker, sadder place without the music they make. <br /> <br />All I have to say about this album is:  It isn't quite as instantly accessible as their last one, just like sushi isn't as instantly accessible as steak.  But like fresh mahi-mahi washed down with warm saki and tempura shrimp, this album is a dish that grows on you, and grows and grows, until you can't believe how good it is.   <br /> <br />Listen to it three times over the course of a week before you make up your mind.  I was slightly unimpressed during my first listening a month ago, but now I just can't get enough of it.
1592400876|4.0|The problem with too many writers of humor (or \\"humour\\" for the Brits) is that they think they are much funnier than they really are.  Truss does not escape this reality.  But she is still funny, if not hilarious.   <br /> <br />Unlike most guides of grammar and punctuation, which are desert dry, Truss's book is easy to read.  And it will help everyone better appreciate the importance of proper punctuation.  Of course, it wouldn't have killed her to let us know what a \\"greengrocer\\" is.  But then, even if we were told, would we really care?
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|If you compare all of her Greatest Hits releases so far (many more will follow - you bethcha!) you must admit this one is the most complete and reasonable one. From her Munich days of 'Love to love you baby' to the present it shows her best trademarks.   <br />Well - it's up to you to choose which compilation is your favourite - this is mine.
B00005JLEU|1.0|Perhaps one has to be Japanese to understand this movie.  It is hardly worth reviewing, but after we rented it last night (having heard good things about it in the media - first mistake) I couldn't resist taking a look at what kind of reviews it received.  Imagine my astonishment to find that this highly forgettable movie received an overall rating of 4-1/2 stars.  Of course, the book Eragon also seems to be well-received by the on-line audience which reviews books and movies; perhaps there is a selection bias here as well. <br /> <br />Anyway, my husband and I watched with growing horror as a film with no recognizable plot and almost no stable characters unfolded before us.  I think it was morbid fascination that held us to the screen until the lame but anxiously awaited ending.  Granted, there were some lovely scenes that would make great stills, and a few chuckles here and there.  I will admit that I found the combination of sickly-sweet cuteness and frightening grotesqueness unique, if nothing else.  The \\"monster\\" spirits eating people (although they were regurgitated whole later), and the prominence of nightmarish chases and scary situations made me wonder that this was PG - the rating seemed too low.  Perhaps what disturbed me more (besides lack of plot) was that there were no characters who seemed to be consistent.  For example, the \\"witch,\\" although supposedly evil, congratulates the heroine (Chihiro)  at one point for a job well done and tells her other \\"employees\\" to try to be like Chihiro.  The character of \\"no-face\\" seems to be a helpful spirit, becomes a terrifying monster, and then returns to passivity for no real reason that is explained.  These are just two examples of many that pervade this movie.   <br /> <br />We did have fun afterwards imagining what the TV-guide blurb for this would be if it were shown on TV.  It was stranger than any strange movie I've seen (Escanaba in Da Moonlight, Dune, the Point, and Buckaroo Banzai for a few samples, although most of those had some semblance of plot), although I don't go in for weirdness as a rule, preferring to be entertained.  I can't say that this movie entertained me at all.  After I have written this review, I will forget all about Spirited Away, except to tell anyone who asks me about it not to waste his money or time on watching it.
B00005AAFS|1.0|IT SUCKS.  People get so fascinated by the smallest S***.  They think it sounds fascinating because of the german language and how the guy sounds, ok then lets break it down.  This singer couldn't hit a high note if his life depended on it and he is not singing he is just talking, wow what talent, then guitar player has no idea of melodic and/or musical theory thus making everything that is guitar sound so dull and boring, that is also why half of the bands today that claim to be hard rock or metal suck.  And the rest of the band speaks for themselfs.  Unlike everyone else i don't hear soemthing like a german voice in mainstream wanna be metal and think wow thats awesome sounding, instead i break all the musicians up and judge them on talent like it should be and you guys should try it sometime.
B000069AUI|1.0|This has got be the most annoying unoriginal album I have ever heard.  All the songs sound the same and it seems like they never end.  My husband owns this cd and everytime he listens to it in the car it makes me want to crash into something.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|You got to be kidding me? This confirms 2 things I have already known. <br /> <br />#1 Kirk has ZERO role or say in the band and the band is all James and Lars. Kirk is way overhyped as a guitar player compared to james who gets no hype considering he's one of the best player in the world. <br /> <br />#2 They need to leave bob rock and make music again. <br /> <br /> <br />Metallica is overkill. They are so overexposed it's not even funny.
B00005JNEW|1.0|Watched the movie over 14 years after reading the book. As I watched the movie, I kept on thinking, \\"This wasn't how I remembered it in the book.\\" I went back to the book and noticed the following inaccuracies:    1. In the movie it was stated that it was Coach Gaine's 2nd season. In the book/real life it was his 3rd season as head coach.    2. In the movie it was stated that Coach Gaine's salary was 60k. In the book/real life it was 48k. This is a prime example of how poor a job that the producers did with this movie that they couldn't even get straight how long the coach had been there and what his salary was. There's no logical explanation for it.    3. In the movie they showed the team practicing at Ratliff stadium. In the book/real life they practiced at the high school, as is the case with just about every high school in the nation- you don't practice on your game field.     4. In the movie the star running back Boobie Miles suffered a knee injury in the 1st game. In the book Friday Night Lights/real life he injured his knee in a scrimmage.    5. In the movie Permian was shown losing their 2nd game to Abilene Cooper 49-7. In the book/real life the Permian school district chartered a 737 jet to fly the team 530 miles east to play East Texas power Marshall. Permian lost the game by 1 point.     6. In the movie Permian is shown losing to rival Midland Lee by a touchdown. In the book/real life they lost to Midland Lee by 1 point.     7. In the movie Permian finished the regular season with 2 district losses and in a 3 way tie for the conference title with Midland Lee & Cooper Abilene. In the book/real life Permian finished the regular season with one district loss in a 3 way tie with Midland Lee and Midland.     8. In the movie a 5 round, 32 team playoff bracket was shown. In the book/real life there was a 6 round/64 team playoff bracket.    9. In the movie Permian was shown defeating Dallas Jesuit in the 1st round of the playoffs. In the book/real life they beatAmarillo Tascosa in the 1st round of the playoffs.    10. In the movie Permian was shown beating San Angelo in the second round of the playoffs. In the book/real life they beat San Angelo in the last game of the regular season, and beat the Andress Eagles in the second round of the playoffs.     11. In the movie Permian was shown beating Amarillo in the 4th round of the playoffs (again, they beat Amarillo in the 1st round in the book/real life). In the book/real life the beat the Lamar Vikings in the 4th round of the playoffs. The only playoff game that was portrayed accurately was the 3rd round win over the Irving Nimitz Vikings.    12. The movie showed Permian losing to Dallas Carter 34-26 in the 5th round of the playoffs, the state championship. In the book/real life Permian lost to Dallas Carter 14-9 in the 5th round of the playoffs, the state semifinals. The movie portrayed Permian being stopped on the 1 foot line with no time left. In the book/real life the game ended on an incomplete pass.     13. The movie showed Permian and Dallas Carter officials meeting in Midland deciding where to play the game, agreeing to play the game in the Houston Astrodome. In the book/real life they agreed to play the game at the Univ of Texas Stadium in Austin.     14. The movie showed the star running back who was hurt at the beginning of the movie, Boobie Miles, quitting the team and then rejoining the team for the trip to play Dallas Carter to cheer the team on, showing him forming a special bond with his teammates. In the book/real life, Miles quit the team, never rejoined it, and listened to the game on the radio back in Odessa.    15. The movie portrayed one team captain, Ivory Christian, as a defensive end. In the book/real life he was a linebacker.    16. The movie portrayed another team captain, Chavez, as a defensive back. In the book/real life he was a tight end.    There are numerous other examples of inaccuracies in the movie and erroneous portrayals of what actuallyoccurred in the book/real life. Some of the other posters have already commented on many of them. In addition the movie used a bunch of actors obviously in their mid 20s to portray the Permian players. The Dallas Carter players in the movie all appeared to be in their 20s and 30s. These high school players in real life were mostly 16-17 years old. It looks ridiculous to have actors in their 20s and 30s playing a bunch of 16-17 year olds. The movie portrays Odessa as a small town. Its not- its a city of 100,000. And anyone on here who refers to Odessa as a small town is completely ignorant to the fact its not. The movie also overly and negatively stereotyped the citizens of Odessa as a bunch of ignorant, racist rednecks. That's typical stereotyping by Hollywood liberals of small city folks and southerners. Some of the real people portrayed in the movie probably even have grounds for defamation of character lawsuits.     Its a joke that this movie was called based on a true story, and this is coming from someone who lived in small city Texas for several years and followed Texas high school football. It should have been called what it was-a mostly fictional movie. The movie was typical Hollywood garbage. As usual, whenever Hollywood tries to make a movie based on a true event, they always intentionally and unintentionally get their facts wrong, alter events, and make up stuff that didn't happen. Its not worth even paying $4-5 to rent from Blockbuster. The book, on the other hand, is worth the read.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|When I first got the Chariot cd I couldn't stop listening to it. It was one of the best cds I had ever listened to. Later I learned of the release of Chariot Stripped and since I had learned to love Chariot so much I knew I had to go out and get Chariot Stripped. At first I thought it was going to be just your regular run of the mill live performances, but instead the cd was so much more than that. It has such a raw and intimate vibe to it which makes it seem that Gavin himself is sitting right next to you singing his heart out.
B00005JLXE|1.0|Omfg! I absolutely hated this movie! It made no sense at all! Actually the only reason I picked up the movie (thankfully it was rented!) was because Evanescence music was in the movie and I was just curious.

B00001U0E1|4.0|Especially when it's a tongue in cheek movie such as this one. I've seen this quite a few times, as I had the *cough* video before this. And now I have the DVD! Very happy. This was never meant to be a serious look at Shakespeare's life, so if you're looking for a biographical movie about his life, don't choose this one unless you have a sense of humour.<br /><br />This is one of the movies I didn't need to switch my brain on for - not that I ever do - except to spot the obvious references to Hamlet, Twelfth Night, and just to be glaringly obvious, Romeo & Juliet. It's full of fun, and Gwyneth Paltrow repeatedly going topless. I bet she's got it written into her contracts now, that she won't be doing anymore of that now she's a mum. They're not that much to write home about anyway. And the lovely lovely (so much so it needs to be said twice) Joseph Fiennes. I don't like his brother however, but Joseph - he's got nice eyes.<br /><br />There's a whole host of great actors in this, including Geoffrey Rush (who got on my nerves), Judi Dench (utterly fabulous), Martin Clunes, Imelda Staunton, Colin Firth, Ben Affleck (woooooooooo!), Rupert Everett and also look out for one of the girls from EastEnders (UK show), Lucy Speed, who used to play Natalie, credited ever so nicely as \\"Second Whore\\". Some of the roles, however, could have been played by Kenneth Branagh, Winona Ryder, Julia Roberts, Daniel Day-Lewis, Jodie Foster and Meg Ryan.<br /><br />In the beginning of the movie, when Henslowe asks Will if he has been working on his play, and Will answers \\"Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move\\" he is quoting from Hamlet (Act II Scene 2). The lines are from a letter he wrote to Ophelia while pretending to have gone mad, and are followed by \\"Doubt truth to be a liar, but never doubt I love.\\" The scene that show a woman (presumably Viola) nearly drowning in a shipwreck is a direct homage to one of the opening scenes of Twelfth Night: Or What You Will, in which the character of Viola nearly drowns. The priest near the beginning yells \\"a plague on both your houses\\", a famous quote from Romeo and Juliet.<br /><br />There is no need to be afraid of a movie that has something to do with Shakespeare. This is one of the great films, along with 10 Things I Hate About You, that is based around Shakespeare plays - I still can't quite sit through Baz Luhrman's Romeo & Juliet however, it's just too Shakespeare sometimes. We used to do Shakespeare all the time in English at school, and every one of us girls used to have to read Juliet's lines, and every one of the guys had to read Romeo's. Boy, did we ever dread being paired up against a god-awful guy, and the endless immature teasing which came afterwards. This is a great movie, and well worth getting.

6305364648|4.0|I officially love this movie. It's my favourite Arnie film ever, plus it has a very young Eliza Dushku in one of her first starring roles. However, I am disappointed to discover, after getting the region 2 version, that it was cut for UK viewers, in order to make it a 15 certificate, and making it 135 minutes long. I could only spot one scene that had been cut, and that's because it was done so badly. (I can spot stuff that's been added in, but I'm hopeless at spotting stuff that's been taken out, unless I'm looking for it) The scene I spotted was just after Arnie gets given the truth drug.<br /><br />This movie is full of memorable and infamous scenes, including Jamie Lee Curtis' stripping scene, the beginning scenes, the finale (although heavily CGI-d by the looks of it!), Jamie & Tia Carrere (Juno Skinner) fighting in the limo and put it this way, Men In Black & the Matrix (heavily) ripped this movie off. A lot of this is what you see in the Matrix. Tom Arnold is terrific, especially when he's trying to get to Arnie in the van, and skidding about on the ice! (\\"It's called ice and it gets a little slick.\\") OK, you have to see it, but when he sees Dana (Eliza) with a motorbike helmet and says to her: \\"Yeah, I remember the first time I got shot out of a cannon.\\" Or: \\"You know what? I'm sick of being in the van. You guys are going to be in the van next time. I've been in the van for 15 years, Harry.\\"<br /><br />When Arnie rescues wife Jamie Lee Curtis from an airborne chopper, he grasps her by her arm just as the chopper heads out over the water. The woman you see dangling below the chopper skid is no body double, but Curtis doing her very own stunt work. At her insistence, director James Cameron agreed to let her perform this scary spectacle.<br /><br />I absolutely LOVE how Arnie can laugh at himself, bringing out his infamous lines (\\"You're fired\\"), and doing everything but winking at the camera. One of his best moments in this is when he's at the urinal and he starts whistling \\"Edelweiss\\" from The Sound of Music. He also learned how to land and take off a Harrier Jet for the climax of the film.<br /><br />The place where Helen meets Simon at night is the 6th street bridge, the location used in Terminator 2: Judgment Day when we are introduced to the T-1000.<br /><br />Bill Paxton is absolutely hilarious as the used car salesman, who's fantasy world quickly becomes reality. You can't help but laugh at this guy when he comes on screen.<br /><br />My only quibble about this movie? The finale. Although it's great, yadeyadeyada, it's so very much not real, and way too over the top! The only thing that tries to save it is Eliza Dushku, getting in some practice for Tru Calling.<br /><br />As one of my favourite Arnie movies, I command you to watch this. It's brilliant!!!

And I'm sure there's a few guys out there of a certain age, who discovered the, er, joys of older women while watching it.
B0002X314C|5.0|I give this album 5 starts is because this is a debut album. I am so bored today from the over synthesized beats, and the tasteless boring lyrical content. Thank God for Mr. Legend who finally understands that words can change song into a melody with a story. We are complex people, with complex lives and situations. And most of the lyrics I hear today don't reflect my life.  <br /> <br />Besides the Lyrical content Mr. Legend allows us to actually HEAR the piano. AHHHH remember instruments?? Not drum machines and samples. What a breath of fresh air. All in all this CD has a good feel to it. It is mature without being outdated, fresh without compromising the basic elements of music. Not sure about anyone else, but I am happy with the 14.00 I spent.. <br />
0763619612|5.0|This book was just so uplifting and inspiring.<br /><br />Every adult and child should read this wonderful story.<br /><br />I would give more stars if I could!
B0006IUDXA|3.0|As has been stated by other reviewers, this is a no frills package.  Since Season 1 isn't my favorite (the show hadn't found its stride, nor had the Phoenix Foundation come into existence), I wasn't expecting more than being able to fill in some back story. <br /> <br />For that, this set is terrific.  The episodes are full length, not the shortened for extra commercials episodes that you get on TV.  Anderson is good and conveys a real sense of delight and wonder without seeming either naive or stupid. <br /> <br />I like the character, and I like the way he thinks his way out of problems.  It's nice to see a good guy with a complex and personal morality.  Too often, we end up believing that a character is the good guy because we're told he is.  With MacGyver, seeing him in action is believing. <br /> <br />My problem is that these are three steps below bare basic.  There are no close captions or scene selection options which I thought were standard these days.  Worse, the first disc throws the viewer into commercials for Happy Days and its spinoffs.  The only thing those shows had in common with MacGyver is Henry Winkler.  They are impossible to get past, too.   <br /> <br />I haven't run into the color correction or compression issues that some other people have noted.  But I will say that the Avid is only a decade or so old.  These were not edited by computer and some of the older techniques and effects can look a little cheesy compared to the bare basics that can be done on a good computer today. <br /> <br />I'll be first in line for the season 2 episodes because I like MacGyver and the reruns are so chopped and washed out.  Here's hoping that Paramount will give us better quality and maybe an extra or two.
B000002UB6|1.0|Let it Be at one time was great.   <br /> <br />But grow up people, it is 2005, this album is a relic, not a classic.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|After several dissapointing albums from Maiden (X Factor, Virtual XI) where I was beginning to lose faith from them, finally Iron Maiden relased a really great album.  Not only does this album go back to classic Maiden, it adds in some new stuff as well that really goes well with Maiden's triple guitar attack.  Bruce Dickinson is back as well and despite the fact that he's around 50 or something, his vocals really shine.  Though not as good as in the Number of the Beast days, Dickinson back really revives what Iron Maiden was good at, making great classic heavy metal tracks.  Here's a rundown of the tracks.  1. Wicker Man (10/10) A great Maiden song first single and has good reason to be one.  2. Ghost of the Navigator (10/10) A much louder song than Wicker Man, but still a really great Maiden song.  3. Brave New World (9.5/10) The only reason that I don't give this a 10 is a repetitive chorus that doesn't really get you anywhere but is still a great listen.  4. Blood Brothers (9.6/10) A really great more softer piece.  5. Mercenary (9.2/10) Another heavier track though it gets pretty repetitive.  6. Dream of Mirrors (9.7/10) Some people complained bout this song but I really like it.  A 9 minute+ epic that really is a great Iron Maiden piece.  7. Fallen Angel (9.4/10) The shortest off the album but still 4 minutes long.  One of the highlights of the album.  8. Nomad (9.5/10) Another 9+ minute track.  Great instrumentals like that Middle Eastern theme to it.  9. Out of the Silent Planet (10/10) Another single this one has a great chorus a nice beginning intro.  10. Thin Line Between Love and Hate (9/10) This song is probably the worst but hey 9/10 isn't that bad.  Dickinson reveals a bit of an emotional side on this one and it's a good closer.  To conclude I think this is the 4th best Iron Maiden album.  (Number of the Beast first, Powerslave second, Piece of Mind third)  Definitely alot better than the other crap in the metal industry going on today and a great buyreally worth it.
B000002UAX|1.0|The White Album at one time was great.   <br /> <br />But grow up people, it is 2005, this album is a relic, not a classic.
B000002G87|5.0|You can read about the history behind this album in the other reviews, but I'll tell you why it's a five-star. <br />You can feel the intensity throughout this record. There's not one bad song in this collection, and even the covers fit in perfectly with Clapton's works. Anyone who covers Hendrix's \\"Little Wing\\" is either really stupid or really good. Clapton puts that song through a new pace and makes it his own.  <br />With the combination of Clapton's hurt, drugs, and the presence (or should I say pressure)of Duanne Allman next to him on guitar, Clapton was put into overdrive and put out a chunk of music that will never be matched, even by himself. Although his guitar playing is outstanding in Cream and BluesBreakers, on this album it sounds like he pushed his guitar and made it sound how he wanted it. You can hear how he makes it do what HE wants it to, like the energy he had just bled through it. <br />A perfect meld of blues and rock, and a piece of history.
B000069I1H|5.0|Lights. Camera. Aggrevation. <br />   <br />        This movie is awsome. It is one of the best buddy cop comedies I have ever seen. So if you like buddy cop movies I strongly reccomend this movie. The dvd has some cool features. The features on this 1-disc dvd are <br /> <br />1.CAST AND CREW <br /> <br />2.A COMMENTARY <br /> <br />3. ADDITIONAL SCENES <br /> <br />4.THE MAKING OF SHOWTIME <br /> <br />5.THEATRICAL TRAILER <br /> <br />          THERE IS OVER 28 MINUTES OF SPECIAL FEATURES ON THIS 1-DISC DVD! <br />
B00008NG5V|4.0|This is a really great album for relaxing, but it's not all slow and soft, there's some that are up beat and alot of fun. If you've been to or know anyone from New Zealand, it's their kind of music, if that helps. He's HUGE there, and he fits their lifestyle.
B00004SCX6|5.0|You did it again, Britney! Another fantastic album! Even before BABY ONE MORE TIME cooled down! <br />I think this album is like a \\"gateway\\": Britney's bubblegum (BABY ONE MORE TIME) and her dancier grooves (BRITNEY; IN THE ZONE). Sometimes, it feels like this album is \\"incomplete\\" without Baby One More Time. I have the Australian Edition (there are 3 more songs: Girl in the Mirror, You Got it All, and Heart). Oops! is a very good #1. Her cover of The Jets' You Got It All is better, its really bubblegum! Heart is a very beautiful ballad that Sarah Geronimo would fall in love with. <br />This album's great. Here, Britney's first-ever she-helped-write-it song, Dear Diary, is the finale. It's short though :( <br />My favorites are Oops, Heart and You Got it all. Again, she rocks, and I hope her 6th album is better!!!
B000006MS3|4.0|The most problematic album in Kate Bush's ouvre: I still can't figure out (after owning it in one form after another since its release), whether it's brilliant art, self-indulgent madness, or an undefinable combination of the two. It certainly bears little resemblance to either \\"Never Forever\\" or \\"Hounds Of Love\\", which bookend it, and as far as popular music is concerned, it's about as accessible as James Joyce's literary work referenced in the title of the review. That said, it's strangely compelling, deeply weird, and highly recommended. And if you ever figure out what it's all about, please tell me!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|one of the best albums indeed. Here my favorite Britney song (and second fav. overall) lies, Toxic. It is so cool & cute. The opening, Me Against the Music, brings our ol' faithful Madonna back to the spotlight. The included remix is better too! <br />Here lies Britney's quietest and slowest ballad, Everytime. It is about being haunted by the memory of a lost lover. It is also appropriate for a funeral song. <br />Outrageous is an R. Kelly song, but Britney sang it. He write and produce, she sing. Her outrageous qualities are listed in the chorus. <br />Breathe on me was released in US only. But its great. <br />Early Mornin' is a very nice song, and I love imitating it. <br />The Asian version has an added track: The Answer, a punkish song. It's another good song of this superstars'. <br /> <br />Britney is the only artist to have her first 4 albums reach #1. So if you want to listen to pop, take her albums! And, to all those Britney haters out there, (f-word) all of you.
B000069I1H|3.0|I know Murphy hasn't done anything good in along time, I figured a guy like De Niro and him doing a cop movie, it had to be good.<br /><br />Well, it was okay to say the least.<br /><br />If you guys are die-hard Murphy fans, go ahead and watch but, I too was once a big fan, and I'm not all that impressed at all. The last movie he made I enjoyed was probably 'The Distinguished Gentlemen'. Good movie...<br /><br />As for De Niro, he has and could do better than this.

B00014K5TQ|5.0|I think that Culkin was horrible in his role. Seth Green is the man who stole the show. There was just something about the story that makes you want to dig a little deeper. I liked this movie because it was different and was somewhat based on Michael Alig's life.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Has Britney gone too far? No. But then again, she might have. She has left her teen years behind and has also changed her music style.  <br />So there it is: a 20-year old woman with a third album and a movie where sev'ral songs of the album are put in.  <br />The titles say it all: <br />1. Britney - thats her <br />2. Overprotected - Britney is too protected and wants to be free <br />3. I'm Not a Girl Not Yet a Woman - She's not a little girl   anymore, but she also isn't a woman yet. Shes in between <br />4. What Its Like to Be Me - she shows us that <br />5. I Love Rock n Roll - she loves Rock Music <br />6. I'm a Slave 4 U - she is a slave to music <br />My favorite track is I'm a Slave 4 U. Those who hate it, I also hate you. It sounds funny and nice. <br />So, another piece of greatness! Britney shows us her talents. She has written more songs in this album. Her voice is so nice.
B000004286|5.0|Just kidding. This is the best soundtrack I have heard in a movie, and James Horner never ceases to amaze me. It adds so much to the Mel Gibson film \\"Braveheart\\" so much, which is partially why this is (in my opinion) the greatest movie ever made. <br /> <br />The best song from this score in my opinion was The Execution/Bannockburn mostly for the Bannockburn part of it where the armies are lined up at the end of the movie. The song just had so much emotional enthusiasm and it sends shivers up my spine everytime I hear it. It's just that good. <br /> <br />I don't suspect we'll see a soundtrack that surpasses this anytime soon. I was very impressed with this music.
B00000J7S8|2.0|Wow, am I disappointed after finally buying this CD. Other Amazon reviews and Grammy award nominations made me put my gut instinct aside and take the plunge. Not only is there virtually no passion in her voice, the clarity, inspiration and energy that so characterizes her personality on the Live In Paris CD, for example. is utterly lacking in this studio composition. <br /> <br />The arrangements are pleasant, for sure. Let's Face the Music and Dance and the title song try to create an atmosphere, that's why 2 stars instead of 1. I am contrasting Diana's work simply against her other CDs, not against other performers. <br /> <br />The lyrics are a joke, repetitive, simple, uninspiring. The voice is smooth, yet lacks any passion or interest even. Skip this one,  unless you just have to have every Diana Krall CD in your collection. Commercial interests won over artistic expression in this one, and it shows.
B00005K3NR|5.0|I read Stephen King's \\"Carrie\\" at a young age, when I was 13, and not surprisingly, it freaked me out. Now I saw the movie for the first time at 32. Brian De Palma's credit lies in being able to make the film as breathtakingly engrossing as I felt when i was reading the book. Tastes develop, and something i liked at 13 is not likely to impress much in my early 30s, but with \\"Carrie\\" the movie I felt like i was revisiting the book, and felt all the chills again. But the film, or the book for that matter, is not just about chill factor. Issues like teenage angst, upbringing, peer pressure and the need to fit in are touched upon in the process, without losing sight of the fact that this is a \\"horror movie\\". We are left thinking does Carrie White really deserve to burn in hell, as the graffiti on the vacant plot notice says? In my book she doesn't. Contrast the families of Carrie and Sue Snell. Carrie's mother is a fundamentalist freak who calls breasts 'dirty pillows' and thinks the natural processes of growing up are sinfull. No wonder then that her daughter is a social misfit. Sue Snell's family, by contrast, is happy American suburbia. Although Sue initially takes part in tormenting Carrie, she quickly makes amends and is redeemed. In the end, she is the only survivor in the horrible climax, which is somewhat cheesily done (by today's standards) in split screen (i am told that was a common technique in 70s movies). But memorable scenes abound, the opening shower sequence, the silenced bloodbath scene with just the sound of blood dripping from the bucket, Carrie's mother knifed to the walls in a crucifix form, but my favourite came pretty early in the movie, the scene in the classroom when Carrie says she finds Tommie Ross' poem \\"beautiful\\" - an over-the-shoulder cam shot in which both characters are facing us, we can see the expressions of Tommie and Carrie, he really likes her. Perhaps he didnt deserve to die. Fantastic performance by Sissy Spacek!
0790731452|4.0|As I noted in my review of \\"Night of the Comet\\" (NotC), there are movies that really impress you when you first see them, but disappoint on subsequent viewings. Like NotC, This is one of the few that flips that one its head. When I first saw it in the theater, I was mildly amused but generally underwhelmed. Then I saw it on video and it seemed better. Since then, I've watched it a number of times and each time, it seems to get better (except for some of the business with Tom Jones). <br /> <br />The sad thing is that I can still see why I didn't like it in the first place and so I feel guilty about enjoying it so much. I can live with that, though. <br /> <br />This film deftly skewers everyone and everything - politicians, the military, rednecks, lawyers, new agers, entertainers, scientists, journalists, the media, business people, seniors, you name it, they're all fair game. What's shocking is that as you watch it, you can identify each of the characters with someone in real life! <br /> <br />A guilty pleasure to be sure, but still a pleasure.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Somewhere in the year 1984, a cyborg killer ( Arnold Schwartzenger) has been sent back through time from the future to exterminate a young woman named \\"Sarah Conner\\" ( Linda Hamilton) whom will the mother of a future messiah, another person from the future is a soldier ( Michael Bien) on a mission to protect Sarah and defeat the unstoppable killing machine.<br /><br />An original Science Fiction/Action thriller that has became a runaway success back in 1984 and is now reguarded as a classic among the genre. What makes it a classic is it's original storyline, the infamous \\"I'll be Back\\" line, great acting, perfect direction by James Cameron ( which this is his debut film) and Arnold Schwartzenger was just perfect to play the title bad guy in this movie.<br /><br />The Special Edition DVD contains great extras like two featurettes, TV Spots, Trailers, Deleted scenes, an easter egg, still galleries, new interview with James Cameron and excellent picture quality with great sound.<br /><br />A must have DVD with it's sequel if your a sci-fi and action movie nut.
1400043662|4.0|the only reason kafka on the shore is not a 5 star rating is because of what it stands against in murakami's backlist. for most other authors this would have been a career highlight, a bizarre journey into the depths of the heart, about letting go, forgiving and discovering love. while kafka on the shore can be dismissed as oedipus on drugs, it is much moer than that. it is dirty nirvana, it is beat poetry, it is the echoes of the heart.     however when compared with norwegian wood, or wind up bird, murakami disappoints us. yet, this is new direction, the reader has to admit to let go. to not question what he doesnt get, to follow murakami as he takes us through his metaphysical world, where nothing is as it seems yet all is resonant with our soul.    murakami's protagonists the 15 year old kafka and the older nakata are contrasting characters unified in their search for something elusive, but their paths criss-cross in inexplicable ways. the beauty of the novel lies in its wonderful prose, the translation is supreme and as usual murakami brings unique powers of observation in this heartbreakingly beautiful, erotic and weird novel.
B000641Z90|5.0|&quot;Phil Inn&quot; was the &quot;nom de l'air&quot; of a local DJ in the seventies on Toronto's CHUM FM. When he wasn't &quot;filling in&quot;, Rick Moranis was often there.<BR>Ask my father about a movie that is 123 minutes long, and he'll take 124 minutes to tell you.<BR>I'll take a few words only.<BR>This &quot;final concert&quot; is over two hours of fine music. Phil is in great voice and at the drumset. He has wonderful backup, especially the great Leland Sklar, now looking a bit like the old man from the forest, but embarrassing bass players decades younger with his touch and tone.<BR>Phil filled in all the gaps, and, if he has stopped touring, there will be huge shoes to &quot;Phil.&quot;
B0002DRDBE|4.0|ok...how come there are no delted scenes on this dvd? and it says all this stuff is on disc 1 but i can't find it....please let me know
B00004XOWM|4.0|This album is not as bad as I remember it.  I think this is pretty good.  The ending songs start to go softer and the Rollin' (Urban Assault Vehicle) song sucks but the album is pretty good.  The only song that could have been better was the song \\"Hot Dog\\".  Instrumentally it was good the lyrics just sucked.  I didn't like that whole \\"F\\" word every two seconds thing that was going on there.  Other than that, go buy this album if you're into the rock/rap type of music.
0780626966|5.0|Hey all. I love 80's horror movies. I recieved this collection for my birthday last year. It is BY FAR one of the BEST collections I have seen. The only dissapointments are the 4th and 5th ones. (I never liked them anyways). The 3-D sequence in \\"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare\\" Totally makes it worth it.
B00005A46T|4.0|This is a really good album.  Probably their hardest album at this moment in time.  Now if you want to here Slipknot giving you really heavy muisc buy this album.  I'm not all that into super screaming, can't hear a damn word he just said if he even said a word, style of music but this album is really good.  It could be that has really good music behind the vocals.  Corey Taylor is also a good vocalist too because he'll the low notes when he wants to and the the more melodic notes he feels like it too.  Overall, I would recommend this album to people willing try this style of music.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Being born in the early 50's, I grew up with all the classic A and (sometimes better) B Sci-Fi movies i.e Earth vs The Flying Saucers. I also had and continue to have a wish that I could time travel back into the 30's and 40's to satisfy my intrigue of the imagery and life of those days that today are only black and white mementos in my parent's photo albums.  That's why Sky Captain was a treat for me.  <br />Let me simply suggest that if you are a BOOMER as I, you stand a pretty good chance of really enjoying this film.  Not to mention how the director's vision was achieved technologicaly.  Impressive stuff!  If nothing else, he should take pride in knowing that he accomplished what nobody else in Hollywood has done before.
B000001Y42|4.0|I got this album after \\"Chocolate St*rfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" came out and I'd have to say that this is probably their hardest album at this moment.  I was impressed with it.  I like Significant Other better but this was a really good album.  This a would be a good Limp Bizkit album to buy if you don't already have it.
B00063MBU8|2.0|ok, honestly, &quot;welcome to my life&quot; has got to be the CRAPPIEST SONG EVER!!! pierre's voice is 100% WHINEY and it's just HORRIBLE. however, a much better song would be &quot;shut up&quot; which is fun and not so disgusting. the only problem i have is, simple plan better get some new topics to sing about. i mean, all their songs are basically, &quot;my life sucks, nobody understands me&quot; i mean, it gets old.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This album is what made me like Limp Bizkit.  This album is so bad @$$ words can't describe.  From beginning to end this album is good.  \\"Break Stuff\\" is a really good song although I stopped liking it a lot as soon as it was overplayed.  This album shows a great mix of rap and rock.  I would recommend this album out of all Limp Bizkit's albums.  This one was just really good.
B00005JMAH|4.0|A murderous psychotic on the loose, packs of horrifically vindictive wraiths, omens of a horrible future and yet another new \\"Defense against the Dark Arts\\" professor - it must be the latest \\"Harry Potter\\" movie.  Though they've been churning out movies at quick speed (\\"Goblet of Fire\\", the fourth movie, is scheduled for a late 2005 release, about four years after \\"Sorceror's Stone\\"), this movie seems fresher than some stand-alone movies - knowing when to follow the grooves, and when to beat its own path. <br /> <br />The flick opens with Harry on his way to Hogwarts amid a crisis in the world of wizardry - rogue wizard Sirius Black - has become the first to escape the dreaded Azkaban prison, the Alcatraz of the magical world.  A reputed psychotic, Black had been consigned to the inescapable Azkaban for his role in the murder of Harry's parents (a fact not told to Harry immediately, even though we've seen it in trailers).  With Black at large, the magical authorities unleash \\"Dementors\\" to recover him.  Like a pack of grim reapers, the Dementors make little distinction between good and evil, concerning themselves only with those they seek, and those who would stand in their way.  Sure that Black will hunt Harry down at Hogwarts, the Dementors besiege the school.  Though professors try to keep life at the school as normal as could be (considering what we've seen of Quiditch and professors like Snape) a showdown is inevitable. <br /> <br />This is my fave of the three movies - it's still not as big enough leap over \\"Chamber\\" and \\"Stone\\", it doesn't really make the most of the characters, and the script relies on using dialog rather than nifty plot twists or deductive reasoning to explain the questions it raises, but it's still more original than the other two.  Hermione and Ron get less to do, but they've become a more cohesive group than before.  Michael Gambon, a great actor, takes over for the late Richard Harris, but the script doesn't give him much to do.  Rickman is back as the great Snape, but again, the script conserves the gleeful malice of his character.  There are some signs of brilliance cut short (a great yet abbreviated scene in which students are taught to confront a shape-shifting menace that mirrors their fears) but on the whole, it's satisfying.   <br /> <br />FOR PARENTS: This movie is darker than the other two.  Yet my 5 and 7 year olders were able to enjoy it from credits to credits.  Oh, and unless you're watching on a screen smaller than 21\\", this is not a movie you should be watching in \\"full screen\\".
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I'd have to say this is their best album from all three.  The self-titled album was OK.  Iowa was really good and now Vol.3:(The Subliminal Verses) is the best one they've come out with.  I'd say if it wasn't for this album I wouldn't like them as much as I do now.  Yes, it's different from their old stuff but people do change.  It is possible that they don't feel like screaming and growling every song they do. Overall, I say this is a very good album and can't wait for them to come out with a new one.
0316666343|5.0|This was amazing! The book starts with a horrible tragedy, but shows how something beautiful came from it. This novel affected me in a way no other novel has. At the top of my list!
B000003TAB|4.0|this is one of my favorite albums, but please guys don't start calling it hardcore or punk, cause its not. <br /> <br />though this album is not quite as grundge as other albums by nirvana, it has a style unlike other bands. kurt cobaine had balls to produce this album, and i admiire him because of his style and the way he is. as a huge nirvana fan, I would defenately say this album is good, except for songs like molly's lips and some other horribly punk wannabe song, which doesnt spoil the album <br /> <br />My favorite songs on the album <br />- hairspray queen- this is suck a wicked song, i hum it cause i still don't know the words. the vocals are awesome <br />- dive- its just a good song, very catchy <br />-turnaround- this is by far the song with the best lyrics that i have ever heard. its why i love nirvana so much, and to top it off the melody is good too. <br />-
B0000TB01Y|4.0|The story behind this musical has to be the most wonderful thing I have ever heard, it is complicated and touches things on so many levels.  It is great for children who enjoy the Wizard of Oz and even better for adults who can ponder the questions that this musical stirs up.  There are a few songs in this musical that are just stunning, like Defying Gravity, I'm Not That Girl, No Good Deed, but then there are some that seem unnecessary and seem like just frilling, Popular, Sentimental man.  However, the frills aren't many and Defying Gravity is one of the most empowering songs I have ever heard.  No Good Deed is also incredibly heartbreaking and leaves you with just such sympathy towards Elphaba.  This soundtrack is worth it, the few bad songs dont get in the way, thats why we have the skip button!
B000002BPS|5.0|Believe it or not, albums with less publicity are always the best. <br /> <br />I have a weird taste of music, with my 3 favorite bands being nirvana, no doubt, and the offspring, i look for a lot of things and in my music and im pretty picky. <br /> <br />this album is so good, and i dont understand why everyone hates the song i choose, that song is so great its the reason i wanted the album and the first song i listened to repeatedly. <br /> <br />the last song on the album is cool cause u hear the guitar part at theend of \\"smash\\" which i thought was cool. <br /> <br />i really can't decide which album is my favorite but this is pretty much on top, its unique and the skaish comical song \\"don't pick it up\\" is another reason why i adore this band. so pick up this album.
B00003CX8V|2.0|The video transfer is not that good, and no extras. This 5 star movie got a 1,5 star dvd. But deserves an AAA treatment instead. Too bad Jack Lemmon, Fred MacMurray and Billy Wilder are dead. But Shirley MacLaine is still there. I am sure we'll get the right DVD sooner or later.
0385336810|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The best way to find out what it's about is to read the summary the book gives, because if I say anything else about it, I'll give too much away. <br /> <br />However, it is really funny and appealing.  I really like the Shopaholic series, but I think this novel is even better.  There seems to be more slightly more emotional substance behind it, and the main character, Emma, seems a bit more realistic and doesn't have the outrageous flaws that Rebecca from Confessions couldn't conquer.  If you liked Bridget Jones and the Shopaholic series, you'll probably love this.
1594200106|3.0|Although Mr Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n has published many other books, this is his first one to become a favorite.  In many ways it seems like a first book.  Other reviewers have said that it is overlong.  I agree.  Dickens can write an 800 page book that yet is shorter than might have been.  This book suggests that this is not Ruiz-Zaf&oacute;n's case.<br /><br />The plot as such can't be faulted.  The book starts and ends with the same image: a boy and his father approaching an old building in old Barcelona, through the vanishing night fog.  Many of the characters are excellent, particularly the tortured Julian Carax, and his nemesis, the police inspector.  Fermin is also fun, but sometimes a bit too cute for an adult book.  Barcelona is nicely portrayed in this story.  Perhaps a map for non-Catalans would have been nice.  The architecture is well-portrayed, in this neo-Gothic tale.<br /><br />So what are the defficiencies?  Some characters (such as the blind pianist to whom Daniel, the protagonist reads, or Beatriz's brother, and even Daniel's father) don't really come together.  They appear to me quite underused given their potential.  In this sense, Ruiz is more an \\"atmosphere\\" type of author, rather than a \\"character\\" guy (like Dickens) or a \\"plot\\" guy (like Umberto Eco, to who he has been likened, somewhat spuriously).  Noting a likeness to Borges is a bit insulting to the Argentinian sage.  Not all books featuring enormous librabries are Borgesian.  The book has also several factual mistakes, the most jarring of which, to me, was that Bogota was in Venezuela.  Although Caracas was once a Colombian city, Bogota was never a Venezuelan one.  One would expect a Spaniard to know this (Ronald Reagan once confused Colombia with Bolivia, but such mistakes are more annoying when the guilty party belongs to the same culture).  I expect a Barcelonian would probably find many factual mistakes in the city's alleged architecture, but that's just a guess.  In the Spanish language version, the author employs many jarring anachronisms.  At one point he has Daniel saying to Fermin to \\"rebobine\\" (rewind, or repeat what he was saying), which I expect would not have been really used in the early fifties.  My issue of the Spanish Dictionary of the Royal Academy (the standard Spanish dictionary), which is the 1992 version, does not even include \\"rebobine\\" as a synonim to \\"repeat\\".  Of course these discussions may seem arcane to English readers, but a really good book does not make this sort of simple mistakes, which show that the book was dashed out without much care or editing.  Good atmosphere is not all.  Proper research, and care for language, are also important.<br /><br />This book, in fact, is not really very good, but it makes for amusing reading, perhaps in the context of a pool-side vacation.  I would have given it 3 1/2 stars if that were possible.  I don't think I'll re-read it, or give it as a present, but it was, all in all, a few hours of fun.many jarring anachronisms.

B0001EFTVA|5.0|Japanese animation director Satoshi Kon has done it again - making a film for adult sensibilities without resorting to excessive violence, profanity or pornography.  And like his previous films, Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers is hard to place on a shelf.  Is it anime?  It doesn't subscribe to the formulas that Americans have ascribed to anime: no robots, spaceships or superheroes.  Is it drama?  Though the story has elements of drama, it's also remarkably comic and filled with moments of fantasy.  Is it adventure?  Well, yes, but how many mainstream adventure films feature a teenage runaway, a deadbeat father and a homeless transsexual as protagonists? <br /> <br />Tokyo Godfathers is a real joy - another hit for Kon, who continues to reward viewers and befuddle the folks who try to shelve films according to genre.
0385510454|2.0|This book was incredibly boring.  Mr. Grisham needs to take a break before he writes his next book.
0375701427|5.0|Philip Roth is undoubtedly a genius.  The power of his intellect, the beauty of his language, the sheer relentless narrative of his novels is remarkable.  American Pastoral (the first in a trilogy followed by I Married an American Communist and The Human Stain) chronicles the Jewish American immigrant experience, the boom post-war years in which \\"The Swede\\" Levov inherits his father's self-made legacy and, whilst obeying all the rules, somehow finds his life unravelling.  The narrative covers 50 years and is stitched together like one of the Swede's Newark Maid gloves.  But there are no kid gloves for our hero, no easy answers to the big questions facing the ex-high school sports star with the ex-Miss New Jersey wife who together somehow produce a psychopathic daughter.  How could the 50s spawn the 60s, Vietnam, Watergate, Deep Throat?  The Swede has no idea and we are left to watch and ponder as his life cracks beneath him.  Along the way we are treated to Philip Roth's discourses - on baseball, beauty pageants, a father's loving description of his pre-adolescent daughter, even the process of glove manufacturing.  As always, they stud this book like literary diamonds.

Vertigo is reasonably catchy, but Bono sounds raw, and the song itself is silly.  <br /> <br />HTDAAB it's just so - commercial. So ordinary in it's commercial intent. They play it safe, everywhere.

0345345061|3.0|I love The Hobbit, the LOTR, and even Tolkien's translation of the Middle English poem \\"Sir Gawain and the Greene Knight.\\"  However, I was less than excited by the Tolkien Reader.  His play about the Battle of Maldon (his play from a story from a real old English poem) is rather boring.  This is a shame, because I've read the Battle of Maldon in Old English, and it's very interesting.  The essay on Fairy Stories is long-winded and cryptic if you haven't read all his references.  The Fairy Story itself, Leaf by Niggle, is not great.  The Adventures of Tom Bombadil are actually a collection of Tolkien's poems, and only a couple of them are actually about Tom Bombadil.  The rest seem to be poems that didn't fit anywhere else, so Tokien pretends that various hobbits from LOTR created them or wrote them down.  Farmer Giles of Ham is a pretty good story.  Instead of going to Old English for his background (as Tolkien did in The Hobbit and LOTR), he goes to Latin as the basis of the story.  It's the only story I actually enjoyed from this book.  Now the book itself is a cheap paperback.  The printing goes almost to the edge of every page, so there's almost no margin in which to put your fingers.  All in all, a disappointing read.

B0002SROSQ|4.0|A pleasing return to form by Nick Cave after the uneven \\"Nocturama\\". Though there are a few moments of weakness embodied in some uninspired '90s style rock songs, there are some great songs that keep Mr Cave relevent and certainly still show his amazing capacity to create brilliant music. Certainly worth a listening or more.

B00003CXB4|5.0|I bought the DVD collection for all the sequesls a few days ago and am not regretting it. The best animated movie among all animated movies displaying the beauty of the African animals and plains. The opening is just great and the sound tracks are so wonderful. Voices by the likes of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg and many more are just superb. I wonder whether any other movie will be able to beat this one and ten years later it is still very popular... Get a home copy.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Amazing experimentation, one of the strongest U2 album ever.  <br /> <br />For me, Pop is very addictive !!. It's a stunning change in mood and especially sound. With Pop U2 once again have achieved something interesting, deep and create that thing so missing in a lot of today's new bands, art !!. Industrial drumming, hypnotic guitars, dark melodies and lyrics, incredible melodies, electronic landscapes, strange sounds, urban production, etc, etc. <br /> <br />AMAZING, SURREAL AND HYPNOTIC. Exquisitely unique, get it now and Throw both ATYCLB and HTDAAB Through a Window !!. <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Sadly, its not a 5 star movie, although why that is comes more from the edits and need for a deeper understanding of situations within the film.  A few of the cuts might have been helpful, but time is always an issue. <br /> <br />The film from a technical standpoint has some very memorable scenes, well executed in many ways.  The acting isnt flat, but the characters are very socially awkward (extremely so) and I believe that, mixed with the setting of the Main Character's home and \\"style\\" makes this movie difficult for some.  I know some of my students couldnt figure out a time frame, thinking it was in the early 80's, but its a matter of missing the setting and character traits.  Pay attention. <br /> <br />Plot:  Teen movie of loner who doesnt fit in, finds a friend, finds romance, wins the day.  The interesting dynamic is that he stills stays within himself, transforming himself within the confines.  Instead of stepping into new territories and new identity, he retains who he is and gains \\"skills.\\"  Its the misconception of the acquiring of skills that's funny.  Look at the culture and the role models. <br /> <br />Laugh out loud moments you've seen, but there are better ones in it not seen.  Some lines are obviously going to be picked up by HS crowd and repeated and repeated, and frankly, that's sad because it turns people away. <br /> <br />Would I recommend it: YES  Should you Buy it: that's a tough one.  I own a copy, my film students demanded a copy in their private library, and if you are willing to actually not be spoon fed, then maybe its the movie for you.
B000002JSP|3.0|Other reviewers have pointed out the growth exhibited by Led Zeppelin on this album. It is true that their style has changed dramatically, and that isn't necessarily a good thing. <br /> <br />The band is clearly experimenting with different styles here, and some attempts work well - the reggae-influenced Fool in the Rain is a classic Zeppelin song, and All of My Love and In the Evening are good tracks as well. <br /> <br />However, songs such as Hot Dog and Carouselambra are so far out in left field that they don't fit in with the Zeppelin style. Not a good introduction to the band; I'd recommend it mostly to those looking to complete their Zep collection.
B00005JNEW|1.0|I have to agree with D. Kirby <br />I had just finished reading the book and thought what a great movie this would be; I don't know why hollywood changed all the facts. Besides getting the players name correct, they did not have to change who they beat and lost to. They only had Permian playing one correct team in the playoffs. Permian was not even in the state championship game that year. Also check out, during the Midland Lee game, the scoreboard shows a Bank Of America logo and then at the end of the game, they show the scoreboard again and it says NTNB.  <br /> <br />You will like the movie IF you did not read the book.

630514415X|5.0|Spike Lee scores a game winner with \\"He Got Game.\\" He portrays a high school basketball player going through the recruitment process.  Ray Allen plays the lead role as Jesus Shuttlesworth and does a great job.  Denzel Washington plays his incarcirated dad who also has a say on where he wants his son to go to school.   <br />  Spike Lee does a great job going into the details of how money, sex, drugs, and women can influence a young mas decision on where to go school. I give this movie five stars and would recommend it to any sports fan especially one that loves basketball. Other movies compared to this one would be \\"Above the Rim\\" which you could purchase as a set from Amazon.com. <br />
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Right up front let me say that I have never been a big Ray Charles fan.  There is something about his style of singing that I just don't care for.  In spite of that, the man had a huge influence on the music world and was a tremendous performer.  This album is a little odd because of the assortment of people with such varied styles, as well as a somewhat strange choice of songs.  The interesting thing is that in most cases it succeeds.  In reading the other reviews, it was apparent that not everyone always agreed on which duets were the best.  That indicates to me that it depends a lot on your own preferences which songs you'll like.  There is something here for everyone.  Ray does sound a little weak and shaky at times, but at his worst he still sounds better than some so-called artists at their best.  I think this is worth having just because it is his last album and due to the uniqueness.  I think that any last effort by Ray Charles would have been disappointing.  After all, when a legend has done it all, it's not easy to top yourself.  Given that Ray was soon to die and knew it, there is still a lot of \\"juice\\" left that comes across here.  Most of us are willing to cut him some slack.  No, this is not the spunky Ray Charles of earlier years, but I don't think anyone should or would expect that.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|Live Aid occured over two decades ago. It older then I am. TThe music it contians is timeless. There is some thing for everybody, no matter what your taste in music. The musicians had amazing preformances, because they were playing for something they truly believed in. They were helping raise money to help feed Africans.       The DVD set is a great value. The four DVDs in the set contains over ten hours of footage. Best of all roylaties from the concert go to helping hunger relief operations in Africa.
B0007GBBVO|5.0|Finally, a real 3-D feature film on DVD in field sequential format!  <br /> <br />Throw out those old flat 2-D versions, here is an excellent stereoscopic transfer. Charles Band's third 3-D movie (PARASITE and METALSTORM were the earlier ones) is low budget fun and recommended viewing for Full Moon, 3D, and monster movie fans. You've never seen THE CREEPS if you haven't seen it 3-D, and now you can watch it in all its full color stereoscopic glory in your own living room!  <br /> <br />Mr. Band, I'd love to see more 3-D movies from you in the future, and 3-D DVDs to follow.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I had never heard of director Michael Mann before watching \\"Collateral,\\" but I confess now I'm watching.  In the early going's of the movie, I grew leery as short MTV-like shots were fused together in the artsy style that leaves people saying, \\"that sure is artsy,\\" but mumbling under their breath, \\"\\"that sure is annoying.\\"  You know the spliced scenes in which no one or nothing truly comes into focus, voices talk but their separated bodies are off-camera somewhere.  Don't worry it's only the first minutes of introduction.  When you get down to the meat of the story \\"collateral,\\" is an engaging more unique than most ride.  Hold on to your seats.<br /><br />The screenplay is a gem and the movies real strength is the sense of characterization you get from Jamie Foxx (playing cab driver Max) and Tom Cruise (ruthless and smooth hit man Vincent).  These are multi-layered people that you get to know on a more intimate basis and oddly enough especially in the case of Cruise care about.  The first part of the movie leaves you wondering what is it all going to be about until Vincent/Cruise truly checks in on the time clock and goes to work as the assassin he is.<br /><br />There are moments that leave you laughing as the screenwriter shoots for irony and humor amidst the chaos and violence.  For that it reminded me a little of Pulp Fiction meets Die Hard.  Certainly not a brilliant movie or a best of category but well worth the watching and well worth the ride.  Cruise turns over a new leaf as evil killer and Jamie Foxx is just beginning to reveal his true talent.  Jada Pinkett-Smith, as prosecuting lawyer, is extremely easy on the eyes as always.<br /><br />--MMW
0553213105|5.0|I have read many, many novels including all of Jane Austen's; and still there is nothing to compare to \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" It is unquestionably my favorite novel of all time, and what I consider to be the 'perfect novel.'and I've decided to break down the aspects that I think make it so.<br /><br />The Characters:Elizabeth Bennet is my favorite literary heroine of all time, for the simple reasons that she is probably the most consistent, well-rounded character that I have ever come across. Not to mention that she is extremely likable. Mr. Darcy, though not a very intricate character compared to Elizabeth, is undeniably well thought out, and perfectly drawn. But, for anyone who has read this(I think I can speak for just about everyone)there are three particular characters that are memorable, and even lovable, just for their perfectly delightful absurdity; Namely Mrs. Bennet whose \\"sole object in life was to get her daughters married; and it's solace was visiting and news.\\" Then there is Mr. bennet's pompous cousin Mr. Collins, whose proposal to Elizabeth is one of the best scenes in the book. Finally, there is Lady Catherine, Mr. Darcy's haughty Aunt, whose class consciousness, and condescending airs are wonderful!<br /><br />The Plot:A simple love story, and a Cinderella story at that. Though there is no really important issues covered, no intellectual depth to fathom, it remains one of my favorite plots, becuase it flows so easily, there is no awkwardness, is tied together so well in the end; there is nothing I would ever dream of changing.<br /><br />The Diolouge:This is it's absolutely flawless point; the diolouge is perfect; perfect and consistent with each character, it moves the story along, and charms the reader non-stop.<br /><br />Language:Who can resist a novel that makes frequent use of the words:folly, felicity, ductility, oddity, and every other charming \\"ity\\" Austen uses.<br /><br />I really can say nothing else. I have read this book so many timesI have so many different perspectives, so many opinions on it, have so much to say that I could not possibly say it all, so I decided to take the literary view, and build on that. All I can say in conclusion is go out, buy this book, and read it!

B000003JA7|5.0|I can't emphasize the importance of this album enough! Its ambitious concept, thoughtful lyrics, flawless execution and plenty of nice little touches assure that up until now \\"Thick As A Brick\\" has been a template for epic monumental rock compositions. Spanning across 44 minutes, this album has only one song. But that must be boring, you might think. Wrong! Instrumentally, the band plays a mixture of hard-rock, English folk, with jazzy influence, and does it in a prog-rock manner. But that is not the calculated soulless prog-rock that is being released today. On the contrary, the music and lyrics here have so much passion, that you feel it in every note. As usual, Ian Anderson does most of the work here, playing guitars, flute and singing (as well as writing controversial lyrics and designing a booklet, that is styled as a local dayly newspaper). For once his voice lost its quirky touch and expresses sad contemplation instead. And this is about the first time that Ian's passionate singing fits the music excellently! His trademark flute exchanges melodic lines with John Evans' keyboards, and both instruments are given a lot of time here. This, together with Martin Barre's guitar, make this album's very recognizable, soft yet dynamic sound. The music changes direction so much that it keeps your interest for the entire album. Yet the changes are so skillfully arranged that this ultra long song never breaks into separate parts, but always sounds as a whole composition. <br /> <br />Such a unique combination of perfect elements blended together is very rare. No wonder Jethro Tull couldn't top the success and perfection of this album, neither before, nor after it. Moreover, I think that if there's only one album to choose of the entire 70s prog-rock movement, it must be \\"Thick As A Brick\\", with only a few albums coming somewhat close to it (Tull's \\"Aqualung\\" or Genesis' \\"Selling England\\" spring to mind). So do I think you should buy \\"Thick As A Brick\\"? Yes, most certainlyI do. Its place in music history has been reserved, and by ignoring it, you only hurt your own development as a listener. <br /> <br />P.S. At times I wish that, whenever modern bands decide to make an epic album/composition, they are taken to a mandatory listen to \\"Thick As A Brick\\". That way the world could be saved from a flood of mediocrity disguised in stylish clothes.
B0006A9FKA|2.0|For a British black comedy this one is barely adequete with some good laughs and good zombie makeup. Shaun is a computer salesman who is dumped by his girlfriend and lives with a slacker pal and a mean owner of his apartment, when zombies attack Shaun and slacker Ed with a few other people battle and then get trapped in the local pub. The funny part is when Shaun and Ed are in the backyard and think the zombie is a drunk woman and then start throwing records at two zombies. What really makes the movie so-so is because the scene where the man is ripped apart by zombies that looked so fake and of course copied Day of the Dead and the acting is tepid. Please rent but do not buy. At least watch once or twice.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I think this album made me a bigger beatles fan than i already was simply because it's such a great collection of songs from them.  the fact that there are soooo many more great songs that aren't even on this album makes you realize what a great group they really are.  this cd actually prompted me to go out and find as many other beatles albums as i could get my hands on (or afford) and the more i listen to it and my others, the more i love them. <br />i would recommend this cd for anyone - especially someone who isn't a fan already.  the collection ranges through all the decades that they were together, so you can get a really good sense of how their music changed and didn't change as time went by.   <br />it's true that some of the sound quality on some of the songs could be a little bit better, but overall the cd does what it tries to do - share what some of the best beatles songs are - even though that is really a matter of opinion.  this is really a great album to start loving the beatles, just don't stop your collection there.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Even though filmmaker Billy Wilder has made a number of masterpieces in different genres in a long career (e.g., \\"Double Indemnity\\", \\"Sunset Boulevard\\", \\"Some Like It Hot\\"), 1960's \\"The Apartment\\" still ranks as one of my favorites in his canon. The film has his trademark cynical humor (Wilder co-scripted with his longtime partner, I.A.L. Diamond), but it seems to have a deeper conscience and a more open heart than many of his other films. Even as a period piece, it is brimming with subtle observations about social mores and corporate culture in the early sixties. Very little has changed since then, which is why the movie doesn't seem as dated as others. In fact, the film seems to resonate even more today as a social commentary than the intended comedy it was supposed to be at the time. A very young and energetic Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, an ambitious insurance company desk jockey looking for his rung on the ladder. Toward that end, Baxter loans his apartment to sleazy, married executives at his office in need of a place to frolic with their mistresses. His novel way of networking does yield a promotion from the head of the company, J.D. Sheldrake (initials were big as \\"first\\" names back then), played to smarmy, hypocritical perfection by none other than Fred MacMurray, who was then mired in wholesome Disney films and soon \\"My Three Sons\\". He was a last-minute replacement for the great curmudgeon of a character actor, Paul Douglas, who died suddenly before production. Wilder wisely hired MacMurray, who had not tapped into his dark side since being duped by Barbara Stanwyck in \\"Double Indemnity\\".<br /><br />The complicating factor in Baxter's upward mobility is that Sheldrake's mistress is Fran Kubelik, the office elevator girl with whom Baxter is already smitten. Since Shirley MacLaine is still quite active in movies today, it's often hard to remember what a charming, effervescent gamine she was before she starred in her own elephantine movies in the sixties. As MacLaine still is, she can be a wonderful actress, and she plays Fran effectively as a beaten victim of unwise love with a palpable depth of self-loathing. It's a lovely, unassuming performance, and the first conversation between Baxter and Fran in the elevator is quite sweet. But it is Lemmon, who dominates the picture with his affable demeanor and ironic sincerity. In anybody else's hands, Baxter would have been a put-upon schnook who deserves being punished for facilitating extramarital affairs in his apartment. Instead, Lemmon injects so much of his innate humanism into Baxter that the slow recovery of his conscience in the face of Fran's suicide attempt makes you happy with the inevitable ending.  He also gives the first indication of the fine dramatic actor he was to become in his subsequent heavier films, \\"Days of Wine and Roses\\" and \\"Save the Tiger\\". Comparatively speaking, it's a modest addition to the Wilder filmography but one that does pierce the heart unexpectedly while making you laugh.ine still is, she can be a wonderful actress, and she plays Fran effectively as a beaten victim of unwise love with a palpable depth of self-loathing.

B0000027RL|5.0|yeah. i said it. Pearl jam's ten is, in my mind, without a doubt, the greatest piece of music released (in the last 75 years). And that shouldn't be a big shocker to anyone who has heard the album. I have never heard anything that simply gels and comes together like this. pearl jam's members collectively created grunge/alternative (through green river and Mother love bone), and it was only fitting that they released it's supreme masterpiece. <br /> <br />oh yes....i've heard all of the classic rock that people argue with me about being the best. sure, i own all the beatles albums and all led zeppelin's and the stone's albums, etc, etc, etc. i'm a huge fan of the who and of jimi hendrix. i worship at the feet of ac/dc, van halen, and guns n' roses. still, i feel that, all in all, this is the best. sure, pj didn't quite live up to the potential that they had when this album was released. but VS. was nearly this good, and the rest of their albums are good, not great. Still, this is just beyond words... <br /> <br />the musicians in pearl jam are some of the most underrated artists ever. Eddie Vedder's performance here is no less that spectacular- in fact, i consider myself to not to be a wimpy guy, but i shed a tear or two while listening to eddie's better croons. no, he isn't as monotonous as the millions of poseurs out there today...he can hit varying notes along with his lower-pitched soul-cleansing growls. Mike mcready and stone gossard aren't exactly eddie van halen and jimi hendrix- they're different, but don't let it stop any classic rock marks from picking this album up. yes, i'm talking to that classic rock mark i know from kirkwood, mo (sean..listen up). they run a lesser gambit than they do on VS, but still, what guitarist would almost hit a funky/disco-y riff on a hard, driving, emotional masterpiece like the opener once? Jeff ament is a damn good bassist and jack irons is a pretty good drummer. however, track by track is the best gauge of this album's greatness. <br /> <br />1. Once- how can you not love this? the calm, soothing intro leads to a blistering riff to some of the most catarthic wails of all time...god, the end of this song will haunt you (in a good way) for a while after you hear it. nice solo, too. PERFECT. 10/10 <br />2. Evenflow- hmm...still perfect. it's the kinda song that'd make you want to headbang (to a lesser degree), jump around wildy, and maybe even cry to (the chorus) all in the matter of 5 minutes. This song can burn you out after a while, tho. btw, it's about a homeless person. 10/10 <br />3. Alive- let's see, what's this song? *sarcasm* the first of pearl jam's best quality-the ability to create a great ballad. again, the big moment- the minute-plus solo at the end. man, could it get any better? 10/10 <br />4. Why Go- why do people hate this song? it's awesome! Driving and heavy as hell, you'll prize this song from the moment you hear it. Buddy, THIS is hard-rockin' grunge. sweet solo, don't forget, and my second-favorite chorus on the album. 10/10. transitions perfectly to... <br />5. black- you'll cry. the only way you won't like this song (or the album, in the same sense) is a) you're ignorant b) you're stupid or, most likely, c) you HAVE NO SOUL. man, is it about abortion, because i have a hint it does... 10/10 <br />6. Jeremy- what more do you want to know? listen to the damn song! it's as good as the album gets. flawless. 10/10 <br />7. oceans- meh. yeah, it couldn't stay perfect forever. the real reason i'm not giving it a perfect score is because either of the songs on the jeremy single should've been here. nice and calming, tho. 9/10 <br />8. porch- ignore the obscenity at the beginning. this song rocks. it hits ya hard, tapers off into what i call the 'anti-solo', and then comes back again and knocks you off your feet. i would have liked a fast and crazy solo after the comeback, tho. 9/10 <br />9. garden- man, another 9/10? ^_^. it has a great chorus, and one of eddie's greatestvocal performances. another haunting one. 9/10 <br />10. Deep- wow. maybe the only song pj ever did about the rock n' roll lifestyle...unlike some band my best friend obsesses over *cough*AC/DC*cough*....^_- still, it's a great song, heavy...and i especially enjoy the...umm...slower part of the song. 10/10 <br />11. Release- whoa. this is it. eddie's call to his dad, to reconcile and remember. This song is, in my mind, the greatest song on the album, and a fitting, catarthic exorcism of all of eddie's demons in about 5  minutes. it starts slow, but soon becomes too much to contemplate...in fact, i've spent much of my time trying to determine if this song is like an ending to the mama's son trilogy...well, to figure this album out, you'll be second-guessing yourself all the way through. 10/10. <br /> <br />so, be it whatever you want to call it- desert island disc, whatever- buy it. you will never, ever, ever in your life regret it. LONG LIVE GRUNGE.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|Having bought her 1st and second albums,i can honestly say that Pink is getting better as she goes on. While the 1st album was mainly RnB,the second pop,this one has a much broader appeal. She's obviously feeling a lot more comfortable with her style of music and is unafraid to try some pretty 60's-70's type tracks akin to Janis Joplin.No wonder then that she's been likened to Janis on a number of occasions. At this rate I see no good reason why Pink won't be around for years to come. If you enjoy one type of music only,you may not find this to your tastes. If you enjoy RnB,Pop,Rock,Soft Metal and Dance, you WILL enjoy this album's varied music styles.
6305428352|5.0|<br />This movie is an all time classic. Have you ever been inspired by a teacher throughout your time? If so, you will understand and feel like you know how the students are feeling in the movie. Mr. Holland struggles with his students, having no money, trying to compose his first sympony, and the later having a deaf child shows how much strength a person has and what good can come from different situations. I wasn't a big fan of classical music until I saw this movie. It truely changes my perspective one music.  <br /> <br />I really enjoy the part in the movie with the red-head girl that can't play the clarinet. She practices everyday and always stays after school to get extra help. Just when she wanted to quit because she couldn't play, Mr. Holland made her try one last thing and it worked. I know that Mr. Holland was a great teacher because a good teacher would stay after to help and maybe change a person life without even knowing it. I also went out and bought the soundtrack for the movie afterwards because the songs that are played are great. I listen to it all the time and just enjoy every song.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00012FXAE|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already?... Oh wait, here's something: <br /> <br />Remember that scene near the end where Ripley is shooting away at all the eggs in the Queen's hive, and she's like launching grenades from her pulse rifle and everything?  Well she should have launched on at that damn Queen.   <br /> <br />Focker out
6304068441|5.0|This movie is about the death penalty (against it but presenting balance on both sides of the issue) and a search for what happened on that terrible day when two young people were murdered. Susan Sarandon plays Sister Helen and was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the movie. Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet on death row for murder. The film and the roles are intense, brilliant, powerful and strong.<br /><br />The movie was a box office sensation in 1995-1996. The acting in the movie is excellent for the entire cast. It shows the harrowing experience of the State putting one its citizens to death. It shows the horror of Poncelet being involved in a brutal murder of two people, and the horror of the State putting him to death.<br /><br />George MacPherson Reid (Woodbridge)
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Diane Keaton is Marvelous, Nicholson is Entertaining, The Movie is so Good, Rent it at least, but you have to watch it. It's a movie that will make you feel, no matter how young you are.
B00069A5GY|5.0|This format (DVD-A + standard cd) is very comfortable to me. <br />I listen the cd at my car and DVD-A in my audiophile's room. <br />The record from Knopffler is just great. Delicate melodies, beautiful arrangements and his guitar's sound...like the old times but with the new tech. <br />Te sound of the DVD-A is just perfect, using the 5.1 ways as everybody should.  <br />This format is too expensive yet, but don't hesitate to invest money in this great record.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|To start off, Memento is a weird movie. For the attention deficit or the casual movie watcher, they will not enjoy this movie, but for those who love a psychological twist to their movies and the textbook format thrown out the window, Memento may be for you. Guy Pearce does an incredible job of getting over the affliction that is in this character's heart over his condition and the loss of his wife. As he rummages through his fractured life, he runs into a slew of characters who make this movie even more amazing and thought-provoking. The ending, which is really the beginning (watch the movie) will also make you choke on your food if you are eating as it is riveting in it's conclusion. Amazing concept, amazing movie, and an amazing first outing for director Christopher Nolan.
B0007IPBD6|5.0|I'm not a fan of Damien Rice.  I first noticed him on MTV, when I saw his Volcano video.  I initially thought it was overproduced.  Then I bought this album out of curiosity.  Listening to Damien Rice live was impressive.  This version of Volcano came off much more natural sounding.  Even more impressive is listening to Lisa Hannigan.  I had the same reaction to her vocals on these songs as I had with Lisa Gerard with Dead Can Dance.  Damien and Lisa compliment eachother a lot like Brendan with Lisa Gerard. Lastly, the cello in Volcano sounds a lot like Yo Yo Ma in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or is that my imagination?
B00005JM1F|5.0|What would you do if the house that you are living in is part of a college campus and you will be booted from your place? Well everyones knows you go out and try to find a loophole so you could keep your house. Luke Wilson and his friends decide to make a legitimate fraternity so they can keep the house. The movie starts off humorous and ends humorous. Old School is one of those comedies that makes you laugh until you cant laugh anymore while sticking to an interesting plot line.  <br /> <br />Old School will keep your eyes glued to the screen through all the parties, nudity, streakings, and outrageous behavior. For a little taste of the humor, imagine Will Ferrel being shot with a tranquilizar gun in the jugular and watching him trip out. Who would of thought that a man with a tranquilizar dart in his neck would be able to survive after knocking over numerous tables, pushing a few kids out of the way, and finally falling into a pool, only to be rescued by the donkey trainer. <br /> <br />Whenever I need a good laugh, or just need to relax, I pop in my Old School: Unrated and Out of Control dvd. Let the \\"godfather\\" live on.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is an amazing album that caught me off guard.  I'm a big fan of the British alt rock like Radiohead and doves and these guys fit in very nicely.  If you like Radiohead or doves, I guarantee that you will really like this album.
B00003CWTI|5.0|OK, yesterday I sat down to watch \\"Magnolia.\\" I'd heard a little bit about it: Critics generally loved it, and one friend of mine whose opinion I respect said I absolutely HAD to see it. But there was something about this film that dissuaded me for a long time. Maybe it was the packaging: A single magnolia blossom. What does that tell me? Nothing. I'd seen a music video that Aimee Mann had done for the movie, and it gave me the impression that \\"Magnolia\\" must just be horribly depressing. Then there were hints about a bunch of interconnected stories and something about frogs falling from the sky. \\"Too esoteric,\\" I said to myself.<br /><br />So here I am at the video rental store, and none of the current crop of new releases is really speaking to me, and then I stumble across \\"Magnolia,\\" and I think to myself, \\"Oh, what the hell.\\" So I take it home and start watching ... and suddenly I'm completely swept up by one of the most remarkable and sublime movies I've seen in a long time. And I don't use the word \\"sublime\\" lightly.<br /><br />There are some astonishing performances here by Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, and William H. Macy. Philip Seymour Hoffman is IMMENSELY likeable as a sensitive hospice care worker. The direction, by \\"Boogie Nights'\\" Paul Thomas Anderson, is inspired if occasionally frenetic.<br /><br />What is this movie about? Well, it's about a lot of things including pain, forgiveness, regret, redemption, coincidence, and cancer. Does that scare you off? Please don't let it. Please give this movie a chance, because once you start watching, you will be sucked into it, and your jaw may occasionally drop, and you may occasionally laugh, and you will most definitely reach for the Kleenex. Overall this movie packs a SEVERE emotional wallop, and personally it seems I watched it at exactly the right time in my life. Be advised that at 188 minutes this is a LONG movie, yet it's paced in such a way that it never becomes tedious.<br /><br />This is one of those epic little films that too many people overlook, thinking it will be too arty or pretentious for their tastes. All I can suggest is that if you can pick a gloomy, rainy Sunday afternoon to curl up on the couch and immerse yourself in \\"Magnolia,\\" I'm quite confident you'll be glad you did.those epic little films that too many people overlook, thinking it will be too arty or pretentious for their tastes.

B000035P7X|2.0|I might've expected too much .I'd seen Monterey Pop  , which is by the same director and liked the energy of that .I'd heard a lot about this 'legendary' film . Too much of it is too slow .   We already know Bob is hip - luckily there's some different aspects to the film , when the promoter is talking with TV stations negotiating a fee for Bob's appearance .      There is interrupted music making and it is made obvious Bob is a celebrity , but he spends most of the film behaving like an idiot . In a way , I suppose this is a 'puff piece' , something to make Bob seem hip to all the kids .    Bob is acting in this , so why not just watch something where we're sure he's acting in character ? Hang out for the DVD release of Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid .    Subtitles would have helped - a bargain basement release almost redeemed by the commentary .    A disappointment . Let the buyer aware - rent it first .
1592400876|5.0|I was surprised when this book hit the bestsellers list.  Do that many people appreciate good grammar?  Or is it maybe that they have trouble with grammar and bought this just as a reference guide?  Either way, it's a good thing if it helps improve writing skills in this country.  I bought this book not only as a reference, but to read for fun.  I think the author's clever title greatly helped in getting the word out about this book.  It's mysterious enough to draw people in to see just what the heck it means.  And I must say, I whole-heartedly agree with Truss about people putting an apostrophe in a possessive 'its'-as in \\"the dog chewed it's bone.\\"  That's probably my biggest pet peeve on Earth!  You see it everywhere.  If you like this book, you might also enjoy \\"Woe Is I\\" by Patricia T. O'Conner.
B0006B2A2E|4.0|I wish I could have half stars, truly I do... <br /> <br />  I went to the theatre that day with friends in hope of seeing something brainless and gory, but everything but this was sold out. Was it fate?  <br />  Already having a cult following of indie kids, I was the only one out of my \\"entourage\\" that was happy about this. And I was the only  one who, after seeing this, felt happy and introspective.  <br /> <br />Jim Carrey, formerly Mr. Annoying, stars brilliantly as a very normal and lonely man intrigued by the bright orange sweatshirt of a girl at a beach. The sweatshirt being a very dyed Kate Winslet, he immediately feels a connection. They soon develop a relationship, as all lonely men and orange sweatshirted girls seem to do. It thrives for quite a long while, with his artistic temperment and her crazy humor, but then, as all movie romances (and normal ones) do, it begins to deteriorate. And she gets him erased from her memory.  <br />  Carrey decides to get his erased as well. It was a very Twilight Zone-y form of events, but the hard logic was ignored often in this movie. And it made it all the better.  <br />  Whilst getting the memory erased, Carrey realizes that memories are useful and need to be clung to. So a montage of Kate Winslets in different ages and times happens, with very interesting camera work and effects. The four erasers, the most famous being Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood, try so hard to get Carrey's memory erased against his will that they begin to discover themselves through it.  <br /> <br />So rent or buy this movie. I am not a critic so much as a lover, and I believe that this \\"romantic comedy\\" (gah) is worth a whole lot more than the gory filth I intended to see.
B0000062S0|4.0|First, imagine this has nothing to do with led Zeppelin. Imagine this is a new band, you pop in the CD what do you think? You KNOW there is nothing else coming out right now that sounds at all like this. That alone makes it stand out in the cookie cutter music world of today but wait, there's more.  <br /> <br />In bringing the thought of Zep back into this review let me use the Zep sound not as a direct comparison but as 1 part of what I think is an interesting mix that is descriptive of this release: <br />Stir in one part Zep, some atmosphere from a Mazzy Star Album (Among my Swan?) and something darker....like the mood of a Sisters of Mercy album with edges of influence from Lenard Cohen. <br />Strange mix? You bet! <br /> <br />This is an album about mood and atmosphere. Page has an amazing guitar tone, my favorite of his so far, very rich and THICK but the playing is subtle compared to a bunch of out-front blues/rock leads that you might expect. This album has a darker aged feel to it. It's simple but with layers. This has the effect of having more to give on each additional listen. <br /> <br />I would think of myself as a casual Zep fan with Houses of the Holy being my favorite album but I am very impressed with this CD> Anyone like Roger Waters \\"Amused to Death\\"? The voice here has that kind of weathered feel to it, very dramatic.  <br /> <br />Now, none of my comparisons are of the sound but the feel, atmosphere and mood of the CD which is where I think this is a very different listen than what you might expect. <br />This CD is grey it's rain, but in a beautiful way. It's excellent. Take a listen.
B00028HBKM|3.0|As I watched this movie, I couldn't help but think: \\"Where are the dinosaurs?\\" Gibson didn't even include the one key moment in which Jesus, when dared by Simon, melts down 30 sticks of butter with his heat vision.     Nonetheless, this movie still held plenty of laughs, but not enough to compare to the original book.    I'd like to see Kevin Costner star in the sequel.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|How did this mistake become such a hit? People will laugh at anything today only because other people laugh at it and they laugh  at it because you laugh at it.  The damn movie had no purpose at all and the thing that gets me angry is that people who have no interest in independent movies talk about it like they always knew about it.   I remember seeing a preview of it on IFC last year thinking it would go nowhere, but, some twisted genius at a film festival saw how terrible it was and knew it would be a hit amongst idiot teens.   I'm 19 and I hate it, no matter where I go if I here someone talk about it I speak my mind, I can't let people go through life thinking this movie is good.  Think about, if Ms.Swan from Mad tv had a movie 80-something minutes long would you wanna sit through it?  HELL NAW! That's how this movie should be viewed as a sketch comedy character.  Pat from SNL had a movie that went nowhere, Wayne's World wasn't (...), Coneheads was cool but still think about. Try to look at from that point of view.
1400034205|5.0|The Razor's Edge is an unusual amalgam -- three-quarters witty social commentary about American and European society, one-quarter Eastern philosophy -- bound together by Maugham's impeccable prose -- almost as though Henry James and Hermann Hesse had collaborated.  The book contrasts the adventures of Larry, a seeker who travels widely in search of life's meaning, with that of his former fiancee, Isabelle, who sacrifices her love for Larry in favor of wealth and social standing.  While the book is an odd literary chimera, the result is supremely satisfying.  One gets to luxuriate in Maugham's biting descriptions of the social milieu in Paris, the Riviera, and London, while simultaneously being exposed to some much bigger issues presented in the context of Larry's intriguing quest for enlightenment.  Along the way there is beauty, degradation, betrayal, forgiveness, art, fashion, turgid fascination with France's demimonde, and lots of other juicy material.  A great read -- fun yet substantive -- like eating a fluffy eclair that actually has nutritional value!
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|The packaging, video and sound quality are far from perfect, but there was never any question that I needed to own Live Aid on DVD, particularly at this price. ($24 and change at Sam's Club) It's not as though I was moved to tears (the post-mortem concert for Freddie Mercury does that), but it's worth it to see the best of the 80s unfurled at two stadium shows. It is also instructive to see the dramatic difference in American and British audiences. Elvis Costello once dissed the US fans, claiming that pop music is the only culture that they have; obviously he had never seen the way Brits react to *their* pop heroes. Witness Queen taking a throwaway song like \\"Radio Gaga\\" and turning it into an anthem that seemed to unify every pair of hands in Wembley Stadium into a single living organism. That, by the way, is the dramatic highlight of the four-disc set. Here are some others: <br /> <br />- Bryan Ferry (of Roxy Music) never gained more than a cult following in the U.S. but across the pond, he drew as much applause as Sting. Here he plays \\"Slave to Love\\" which probably was his most famous hit in the U.S. because it was featured in the steamy Kim Basinger movie \\"9-1/2 Weeks\\" <br /> <br />- Beach Boys -- if only because I don't recall Brian Wilson ever performing with the rest of the band, ever. <br /> <br />- David Bowie -- I somehow missed his set during the original broadcast, and here the band was pieced together quickly from musicians such as Thomas Dolby and his friends, including the drummer from Prefab Sprout. In any case, Bowie played a high-caffeine set that rocked. <br /> <br />- Elton John and George Michael -- if nothing else, this is an essential snapshot of Michael on the way up and Elton before he was deeply affected by the deaths of Princess Diana and Versace. <br /> <br />- Eric Clapton -- because most British artists kept their popularity only in the U.K., but Clapton is transcendent; to see the Philly crowd erupt at the opening notes of \\"Layla\\" is aslice of rock heaven. <br /> <br />- Crosby Stills and Nash -- Look at the way they amble onstage, obviously unrehearsed, still apparently bickering over the vocal arrangement, but still, the crowd ends up in a massive sing-along on \\"Teach Your Children\\" <br /> <br />- Hall and Oates - for those wondering why they went on near the end, do try to recall that at the time, they were the top-selling recording artists in the U.S., and also, Philadelphia was a hometown venue for them, and their band became the house band backing up the real headliners, Mick Jagger and Tina Turner, at the end. <br /> <br />One last note: I've never been surprised at anything in the Extras section, but if you are any kind of INXS fan, and what fan of 80s music isn't, the Extras features two songs live from INXS, \\"What You Need\\" and \\"Don't Change\\" which were their traditional finale/encore numbers from the pre-Kick days.
1878424319|1.0|Personally, I didn't enjoy this book.  I didn't like the writing style of the author.  He repeated himself A LOT - over and over the same message only written slighly differently.  The inside flap has a blurb about the 4 agreements (and they \\"do\\" make sense and are things we should incorporate into our lives).  However, after reading the flap, I knew all I needed to know about the 4 agreements and didn't need to read the book.  It was a waste of time for me. <br /> <br />
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Sadly many people put down this film becuase it lacks all the basic elements of a cookie-cutter popcorn flick. The idea of simply taking a moment in two peoples lives and exploring it is more than many people can apparently comprehend. To all of you, I say, enjoy the next Vin Deisel flick, or if you hurry, the Blade film may still be running, somewhere...<br /><br />Bill Murray portrays an aging actor who, needing the easy money, goes to Japan for a week to endorse a brand of whiskey. Johanson is the nearly forgotten young wife of a pasty-faced, stuttering celeb photographer who is left constantly alone while he works.<br /><br />The two lonely's, are each at different points in life, he just going over the hill, her still down in the valley taking her first steps. He lives through her youth and optomism, she through his age and experience. Together they teeter on the edge of sexual tension as well as burgeoning friendship.<br /><br />The movie has no big pay off. Many feel both are unhappy in there lives and maybe should leave them for each other, others feel that the age thing is just creepy, and yet others just don't get it.<br /><br />This is a study in basic human emotion and reaction to situation. It's a film about the short time two people knew each other.

B000002OX5|5.0|When I listened this album for the first time, I did not know that it is a concept album and I am totally amazed by the brilliance of the concept, the songs, the jingles, the lyrics and the playing. I am certain that there isn't another Who album with this many melodic hooks and I am more than surprised when I see this album was not a commercial success it should have been. The original album so good and in the remastered version you not only get the whole album remastered but also almost an equal number of bonus tracks and which are almost equally good as the tracks from the original album. This is most certainly my favorite Who album along with \\"Tommy\\". I would not be able to mention any specific track as my favorite as I have always treated the album like a 1 hour+ radio show. The concept of inserting 30 seconds plus jingles between two listed tracks is something I have never seen in any other album. In case you think \\"I can see for miles\\" can be a reason to pick up the CD, you are damn right but there are other reasons to pick this up. Simply one of the most innovative concept album of all time and which is equally fun all the time and can be tagged as \\"One of the most entertaining albums of all time\\". <br /> <br />A classic, a must have for everybody who care for rock n' roll and 10 times more so if you are Who fan. It is sheer injustice if you still without this album. Get it and choose your favorite jingle and song. Listen to the show.  <br /> <br />
B00066J1RG|4.0|Many people here in Canada didn't hear anything from the dirty-disco-dancefloor-diva before her 2001 hit 'Can't get you out of my head', and they might be kinda disapointed.<BR>Most of the songs on this album are kitch, but in general I like it. The drastic change between disc 1 &amp; 2 really feels good though. She gained maturity, but still sounds naive but oh so cute. I love her.<BR>Whenever you feel sad or depressed, my diagnosis is a good dose of Kylie Minogue !
B000003S0D|4.0|Many King Crimson fans think \\"Lizard\\" is absolutely the best of their albums.   The non-fans generally trash it without consideration.   Robert Fripp does not think highly of this album.    I think it is unique in the band's cannon but severely lacks polishing and there is serious lack in production, otherwise it is a good album. The CD I own is one of the poorest sounding album I have, the volume is mostly low in all the places, so initially I tended to increase the volume while listening with headphones, but in one place suddenly drum explodes so heavily that I was shocked. I would blame that to mastering.    The whole album demonstrates a bit of avante garde style jazz-rock but \\"Happy Family\\" & \\"Lady of the dancing water\\" are almost proper tracks.  The later is accompanied by flute and it sounds really great. The concluding track is another multi-part track where Yes's John Anderson lends his voice and his voice sounds better than his performances for Yes. I am not a great fan of John Anderson's voice but he does a great job here.    Lizard is good album but it is not among by top 5 favorites by them. Not a great place to start with King Crimson unless you are comfortable with jazz, avante garde music (say Frank Zappa). In my opinion there are two ways you can start listening to King Crimson...  1) Start with \\"In the court of crimson king\\" and move forward skipping a few.  2) Start with \\"Discipline\\", then get \\"Red\\", \\"Lark's tongue...\\", \\"Starless & bible black...\\" then move on to 60's & 90's.     But anyway there is no hard & first rule, if you stick to this band for some time, you will realize their greatness eventually.
B0002X314C|5.0|Thank God that there is finally an R&B artist out there that GETS IT! I've gotten so tired of this POP MUSIC that artists are making and then trying to pass it of as R&B or Soul like we are some simple-minded dummies. If you like REAL R&B/Soul then this is a must buy album. I promise that you will not be disappointed!
B00005QW5X|5.0|I was recommended this movie mainly due to my liking of Velvet Goldmine (the two are very different and should never be compared), and I must say that I was far from disappointed. It is a beautiful story about love, trying to find your \\"other half\\", trying to find yourself, & and finally having the courage to be yourself. This is not just a story that transexuals or sexually \\"confused\\" people will be able to relate to, contrary to what another individual said. The visuals are wonderful, as is the acting, and the soundtrack alone will make you fall in love with the film. The comic bits in the movie are hilarious as well.<br /><br />The story is about a young man living in East Berlin pre-wall collapse. He falls in love with an American soldier, and desparate to leave his communist side of the country, decides to have a sex change so that he may marry the soldier and come to America. Unfortunately, the operation was botched and he was left with a \\"one-inch mound of flesh.\\" Not too long after coming to America he is dumped in a trailer park in Kansas, his husband leaving him. He begins to write songs and perform them near and around the army base, catching the attention of a young Christian by the name of Tommy. The two become involved, but when the relationship turns sour Tommy steals Hedwig's songs, shooting to Christian Rock superstardom with the name Hedwig gave him: Tommy Gnosis. Hedwig follows Tommy around the country with his own band as Tommy tours, trying to gain the respect and recognition he deserves, not only from Tommy, but from the world. All of this is gradually told through Hedwig speaking to his various audiences around the country about he came to be the \\"slip of a girly-boy barely standing before you\\", with the occasional aid of child-like cartoons and drawings. The very end scene leaves something to be desired, within me at least, but it doesn't take much away from my love of the film.<br /><br />This is truly a fantastic film that can be enjoyed by anyone though a slightly more open-mind to people of different sexualities and men in makeup is recommended, though will probably be obtained after viewing.<br /><br />Enjoy!ed by anyone though a slightly more open-mind to people of different sexualities and men in makeup is recommended, though will probably be obtained after viewing.  <br /> <br />Enjoy!
0385504209|3.0|The Da Vinci Code, an exciting, thought-provoking tapestry of intrigue is a surprisingly easy read given the rather lofty subjects, art and religious history.<br /><br />To his credit, Dan Brown has woven an indelible tapestry of murder, art, and religion.  An added bonus would be the exotic locales of the story enshrined in the history of the Church as well as some enthralling connections to art.  It was indeed a wise decision to structure the book in short chapters to give the reader a chance, in many cases, to absorb some the more captivating historical tidbits that play a pivotal role in moving this fast-paced story along.<br /><br />If you have a problem considering alternative points of view, especially in the religious arena, you may probably want to steer clear.  But for those of you secure enough in your own ideas that you are hardly threatened by another point of view, I heartily recommend the book.  It should stimulate equally interesting dialogue.
0062502182|5.0|Our 27 year old daughter gave her 23 year old little brother this book in hopes it will help him along his path with heart. The same daughter & I have adopted finding our own \\"personal legend\\" as one of our new year's resolutions for 2005. We're having fun looking for signs/omens along the way. You, too, can find your own personal legend- simply open the pages & begin to read this simple, easy to read book.

0679428895|3.0|I was very impressed with Harris account of the last days of Pompeii. The details described, not only of the volcanic eruption, but of way of life in that period of the Roman empire were great. <br /> <br />I have read a number of books regarding the Roman empire and all though I am not an expert, thought that part of the story was well researched and written. <br /> <br />However, I had more issues regarding the romantic interests of our hero. I didn't think this really added much to the story. I was intrigued by the disappearance and mystery surrounding the old aquarius. Unfortunately, the story lines regarding the new aquarius's wife and the romantic portions were not to my liking. This got to be a little tiresome and in my opinion not neccessary. <br /> <br />I did ienjoy the Pliny the Elder's character. This chracter comes more into play towards the end of the book. After finishing the story, I was left wanting more about Pliny. <br /> <br />All in all this book was still enjoyable to read, and I would recommend it to the fans of history, as well as those looking for some adventure around a volcanoe.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|This is definitely one to watch. Tom Cruise has never looked sexier than he does as Vincent. At first I was not sure about the silvery-gray hair, but boy oh boy, after watching Vincent \\"on the job\\", I was speechless. He plays one smooooooth contract killer. The interactions between Vin and Max the cab driver were very amusing and interesting, to say the least. The one point in the movie that I did not care for, and what kept it from 5 stars, was the ending which kind of left me hanging. It would have been much better if Vincent was just faking his death, perhaps to make it look as though he died to Max and Annie, and as the train pulled away from the couple, he lifts his head and grins or something to that effect. I was sad to see such a cool, suave character as Vincent biting it like he did. I mean, if he was supposed to be such a great man-for-hire, he should have been smart enough to be wearing some Kevlar under his crisp, tailored white shirt. Besides the slight disappointing ending, the movie still rocked and BRAVO TOM, if that is how you are going to age, you will still be HOT, HOT, HOT!!!
0385720920|4.0|Choke is basically about Victor mancini and the ways he gets by in life. He lives with one of his friends, Denny. He used to go to school but he figured it wasn't for him besides that he didn't have enough money to pay for it, so he dropped out instead. He doesn't have enough money to pay for his mother's medical bills, she's in the hospital for Alzheimer's disease so she cant even remember her own son, and because he has a very low paying job, he works as a servant in an old fashioned theme park, so he doesn't have enough money he goes to restaurants orders meals and makes himself choke on the meal until some stranger can come up to him and \\"rescue\\" him having them pay for the meal feeling sorry for victor, then through out the years they send him checks because they feel that they are victor's saviors. He has tons of people sending him checks even people he cant even remember at all, some come up to him in the streets and start talking to him knowing him but he just has a blank look because he cant remember them, when victor isn't at work he is attending meetings for people who are addicted to sex just for the fun of it, even though he is one of those people. There he meets women who are just like him. One day when he went to visit his mom he found a young woman by the name of Paige. She introduced herself as a worker and later on she and victor start to spend more time together. She seems like the perfect girl for him until she starts talking nonsense to him and he later finds out that she's a patient there, she's crazy, and that she just has on the same wardrobe as the workers so she can feel like she works there. Later on victor starts to build a church and has all these news reporters around him and he tells the truth about everything and there are people with rocks and he's there with Denny then Paige comes and eventually everyone leaves and that's the end of the book. I thought this was a very interesting book although I didn't quite understand the beginningbut I later understood what everything meant and it turns out that it starts talking about his childhood. This was a really great book, although some people have their own opinions, because it explained every point of victor's life. I really recommend this book to people who like someone's \\"action\\" life because it has everything in it.
0767817729|5.0|To me this is one of the greatest movies ever. Its on my top 10 list. It is a film that you cant watch one time and decide. It is a film that grows on you. I think its one of the greatest love stories ever. Kevin Costner's performance was very underrated and I think this is one of his better movies. Anthony Quinn's \\"I want you to see what happens to whores\\" line is classic. This is a must own for anyone who is tired of the same old romantic movies.
0060207051|5.0|Goodnight Moon by Margaret Wise Brown was my favorite bedtime story as a child.  There are many reasons why this book is loved by so many.  Brown's simplistic poetry in this book is easily understood by children because she writes how a child would see something  The illustrations are excellent in this book as well. The colors and shapes are all very soft and the colors seem to dim as the story comes to an end.  <br />Although I had not read the book in years, I soon remembered how well I liked the book when I read it to my neice the other night.  The story itself is about a little bunny telling all the familar things around him goodnight. The little bunny even remembers a goodnight for the \\"old lady whispering hush\\".  It is an extremely adorable book and suitable for all children who just need a little something to help them fall asleep.  I know it will cause a few yawns among even the oldest of children.
B00002E224|5.0|I was rendered speechless after viewing this movie, if you can call it that. This film hardly seems like a movie, the characters are that real. Celine and Jesse spend one night together in Vienna and make a connection that is surreal to them and to the audience. Both actors (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) pull off amazing performances in that it is difficult to believe they are acting. The entire film is several sets of long dialogue, unbroken by separate camera shots so much had to be done in one take. The vision of director Richard Linklighter is daring and courageous, as he lets moments of silence, awkward spaces in between conversations, happen between these two just as they would in any real conversation. The movie is not programmed for your attention span, it is simply set out for you as it really happened, or would happen.  <br />At the end of this film, you feel for these people so strongly not because of sweeping background music or witty banter, but because they are so real to you.  <br />By looking at the cover photo of this DVD, one would instantly write it off as a chick flick, but this romance is one that men and women can enjoy.  <br />Go into it knowing that it will be slow paced, and appreciate that fact.  <br />Its unlike any movie you have ever seen.
B00079ZACM|5.0|Absolutely the BEST of the 3 movie made with the same title....shot on location using actual \\"fuzzy-wuzzy\\" tribesmen.....great story and cast....don't miss this one....a true classic!!
0743201140|3.0|The main concept of the book, based on lots of research, is that it it a waste of time to work on your weaknesses; instead, focus on your strnegths--if you know them.  The test you take on the computer gives you your five strength; however the terminology left me cold and wondering what to do with them and how such strenghs work together in my profession.  Most of the web site and the book is aimed at management and HR people and not individuals seeking personal answers.  As it goes the book is a decent start but for folks to capitalize on it, they will need another book that is more specific and with more examples than the petty few in this work.
078681859X|5.0|This book was very good. It created a whole new way of percieving magic. Also, it brings this magic to modern-day London. Stroud did not have to create another world or time. It was an amazing tale of how even the greatest government can be undirmined by those in power. A good read. I highly recommend it.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|I got this album for free from a friend. That was pretty cool, considering \\"Take Me Out\\" had been my favorite song for a couple months. Excited, I listened to it and fell in love. The music is very unique and I liked the album because it didn't really seem to follow a formula. But, now, I'm extremely tired of the album. There are a few songs that I just love, like \\"Micheal\\" which is awesome and hilarious, but I never pop in this CD. My point is, Franz is good, but not great. I would consider it download-worthy and definately worth getting if it's on sale.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I've been waiting for MacGyver to come out on DVD for years... and now I'm SO happy it has!  <br />I'm sure everyone know more or less what MacGyver is all about... Swiss Army knife, duck tape, brain, and no guns... but it's more. It's about friendship, and helping people you don't even know and always trying to do the right thing. <br />Buy it people, and show it to your kids/younger siblings/babysitting charges/grandchildren...
0679721037|5.0|This book is of enormous importance. It give the most accurate and powerful literary recording of what happens to the survivors of a nuclear attack. As a nuclear war is the most horrifying of all prospects facing humanity this book should serve as kind of cautionary lesson to us all. The lesson should be that ' Nuclear War must never happen- that no part of Mankind should ever be subject again to these horrors- and that it is the moral duty of every human being on earth and most especially of all political leaders to see that such weapons are never used again.<br /><br />Hershey's book is an effective document precisely because it is not ' fiction' but rather a journalistic account of what happened to real people. Let us pray to God and do everything possible that mankind will never know such horror again
044024157X|2.0|This was a simplistic novel.  The characters lacked credibility and their personalities were stereotypical.  The plot was unwielding and unsatisfying.  It was difficult to figure out who the ultimate killer was because it was totally unrealistic.  Grisham's novels always have a feel good aspect to them (i.e. lawyer finds his way; justice prevails) and I think that is what hooks the reader.  The quality of the book is secondary.  There are so many better writers out there ( Elizabeth George, Laura Lippman, Peter Robinson).  I suggest readers give these authors a chance.  You won't be sorry.

B0006B29Z2|5.0|I'm really enjoying Iron Maiden again. I never thought they'd be around as long as they have, but there you go.  You have to give them credit for staying power, even when their type of music was out of favor.  I picked up their new \\"Early Years\\" DVD, a documentary covering the band from 1974 up to 1983. They interview almost everyone that ever played in the band up to that point, the notables being Dennis Stratton, Paul Di'Anno, and Clive Burr.  But there were others -- guitarists or drummers that were in for a year, maybe less.  All in all, very interesting.  The point that really comes across in the DVD is that Iron Maiden is Steve Harris. The guy had a dream and he was focused. It's due to his perseverance we have this great band and a great catalog of albums. It's truly amazing to see the band's career from kids with a part-time hobby, to the pinnacle of the heavy metal heap. All of this accomplished through hard work, and without sacrificing a bit of their integrity.<br /><br />The only problem that I saw was that they really didn't go into too much detail as to why key players left the band. There was a little bit of information from Rod Smallwood (Iron Maiden's manager) as to why Paul Di'Anno was asked to leave -- drinking, smoking, substance abuse, all began to take its toll on his voice. Even worse, he began to lose interest in the band. That being the case, he was sacked. Clive Burr's dismissal was barely delved into -- he basically said, \\"And then I was out of the band...\\"  That's it.  Was it exhaustion? undependability? Personality clashes? Drugs? Musical differences? I always viewed Clive as a key component of the band -- one of my all time favorite drummers -- who's really never received adequate recognition for his contributions. But I understand you can't include everything -- otherwise this thing would be four hours long. Barring that, this is truly an enjoyable documentary to watch.<br /><br />You'll also get three concerts on the bonus disc: a '79 show at the Rainbow, '82's Beast over Hammersmith, and an 83 concert from Dortmund.  All excellent shows.  And you can see with each album they got better and better.<br /><br />I've hear that there's going to be a part 2 and 3. If they're as good as this first one.

B000002VC5|4.0|A musical meditation of the \\"Rise Of Machine and The Decline Of Man,\\" the second Alan Parsons Project album hit all the notes that \\"Tales Of Mystery and Imagination\\" missed. For starters, this was a straight forward rock album, without the debut's classical pretensions. It was also where Parsons perfected his atmospheric instrumentals, opening the album with the (precursor to electronica) title track and then ending with the moody \\"Genesis Ch 1 V 32.\\" You do get the jarring soundtrack climax of \\"Total Eclipse,\\" which I always guessed was where man got terminated from the scene.<br /><br />For an album that dealt with the fall of the human race, \\"I Robot\\" is a surprisingly human affair. The slow beat disco of \\"I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You\\" and the dance floor paranoia of \\"The Voice\\" are anything but mechanical. The ballads of loss, \\"Don't Let It Show\\" and \\"Day After Day (The Show Must Go On)\\" could be about any typical heartbreak. Even Pat Benatar could spot the drama inherent to \\"Don't Let It Show,\\" including it on her debut.<br /><br />It wasn't just the drama and the sci-fi that made \\"I Robot\\" so interesting. It was the musicianship. Not as pretentious as ELP and bringing the acrobatics of Yes down to bite size nuggets, Parsons had no difficulty in constructing pop that was progressive, meticulously produced and built up like the studio architect that he is. The Alan Parsons Project recording an album in the period of the seventies this pristine when disco's big boom was steamrollering everything in its path was a pretty bold statement then. Because of Parsons' attention to detail overriding any urge to make music of the moment, \\"I Robot\\" still holds up almost 25 years later.<br /><br />So hey Arista, how about remastering Parsons' catalog?
B00004ZAV3|5.0|..and among the top 2 Pop Performers of all time! Sure, the record people are out to get every dime out of the #1 Rock Band of all time! So what's wrong with that!! This CD is all it claims to be: all the Beatle's #1 hits! Now, I was a huge Beatles  fan way back in 1964, and now I'm over 50, and still enjoy playing their huge variety of great songs. How can you not love \\"She Loves You\\"? Just listen to the vocal harmonies and lyrics, and it will knock you out! For pure versatility, fun, and exuberance these guys cannot be beat. Plus, some top ballads (\\"Yesterday\\"etc)., and even children's tunes (\\"Yellow Sub\\")! What a song catalogue! Interesting that this band had some great tunes that were \\"B\\" side that only diehards, like me, know today..(like \\"I'll Get You\\",\\"B\\" side of  \\"She Loves You\\".. So if you're a youthful fan sick of rap, grunge, etc, you can't miss this one! Oh, and the other of the top 2 Pop Performers of all time, with a recording oevre that matches the Beatles!?  Easy... Frank Sinatra!
038572179X|5.0|This is an amazing read by a masterful writer. You get the sense that every line was crafted to perfection. It is poetry to the eyes and imagination.
B000065B2A|5.0|As a 14 Year Old watching this film for the first time, I was mesmerized. <br /> <br />Looking back 25 years later, it holds the same appeal. <br /> <br />Dennis Christopher, who was incredible in the film, never became a big-time movie star, but should have. Upon further review, his performance in this little movie that could will stand the test of time. <br /> <br />Its a shame the writer, Steve Tesich, passed away before he could leave his mark and record a commentary for this film. The fact that the dvd has little extras is one of the bigger disapointments for me in the dvd era. This should not affect your decision to see this film. It's my all-time favorite, and remains so, 25 years later. <br /> <br />
B00005U122|4.0|The song selection, sound and video quality is really good.  I recommend the cd release, also.  Amazing how it sounds too close to perfect for being a live show, wish I saw the tour.  Backed by some of the best, Roger puts on one hell of a show.  Some extras including back stage footage, and the rehearsal at a small theater in West Hampton.
1400082773|4.0|I first heard Barack Obama's command of the English language in his address before the Democratic National Convention.  His speech brought to mind leaders of the past who had the eloquence and passion to light a fire in people with words alone.  When I saw his book, I bought it to read more of his firey, inspirational leadership.  What I got instead is an insightful, sometimes painfully honest apprisal of the beginnings of that leader's life, and it surprised me.  This book was written when Sen. Obama was just out of Law School.  He was offered a publishing deal after being elected the first black President of the Harvard Law Review.  What he wrote is a memoir that is very obviously written by a brilliant young man.  I say brilliant because his observations and examinations on racial constructs and communications in America is astute and deeply personal.  As a bi-racial man growing up in both white and black America, his viewpoint is unique and his eyes were wide open.  I say young because unlike most memoirs written after great accomplishments and long careers, the voice of this story is at the beginning of what may be greatness, not the end.  Obama gets a chance to look back and examine his formation, and in doing so gives a beautiful and wonderfully full 'state-of-the-union' as regarding race.  It's not the same old stuff, and it is. It felt like my favorite college professors who could make you stop in the middle of a class and realize that you just saw something you thought you knew in a whole new light, and you could never see it the old way again.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I'm a big music fan and especially a fan of great songwriting. Folks, songwriting doesn't get any better than this. At one point in my life I didn't think songmanship could get any better than, \\"Got my mind set on you\\" by George Harrison. He managed to take about 23 words and make an entire song out it that made you tap you toes until they fell off. Well, smack me in the butt with a boat oar Jet has topped Sir George with \\"Are you going to be my girl\\". I think they use 15 words and sing the same verse over and over, but you know what? I'm absolutely sold, do want to know why? Bands that don't use up all of their vocabulary early on are destined to put out a ton of albums because words like cautionary and boondoggle can be used on album number 8. Jet is a mangy looking bunch of simpeltons and that is what we should love about them. I formed a Jet cover band last week called Cessna. We don't shower at all and wear faded clothes. We sing all of Jet's songs and even wrote a couple Jet inspired songs of our own. Here's one of them: <br /> <br />\\"I like your food\\" <br /> <br />I said 1,2,3 come on and go with me cuz' that sesame chicken looks so fine and I really want to make it mine. <br />I say it looks so fine and I really want to make it mine <br />White, white rice <br />Good, good sauce <br />Are you going to eat it? <br /> <br />That my friends is top shelf.

It captivated all of us!<br /><br />Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) learns that he is the son of 2 wizards and has powers of his own.  Harry sets off for Hogwart's, a school where young witches and wizards learn witchcraft and wizardry.  There he meets and befriends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson).  The three of them are great together!  We watch their adventures as the 3 of them learn different spells and how to use their wands and broomsticks.  Some of the rest of the cast; Alan Rickman as Snape, the Potions Master, the late Richard Harris as Dumbledoor, the Dean of the school, Maggie Smith as Macgonagall, and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, the friendly, giant like, lover of strange animals who also befriends the kids.<br /><br />Harry learns how his parents died and then faces the very evil Valdemort, who tried to kill Harry when he was a baby, leaving a scar on his forehead.

B000060MMI|4.0|The world knows all about the pop-tastic Enyas and Cranberries and U2s on the Irish music scene. Each act is Irish in origin and influence, but each act isn't necessarily purveying a style tied to the folk tradition of the Emerald Isle. The uber band that's Bono and Co. snipped that bit of twine eons ago.<br /><br />So Flogging Molly will be many people's first encounter with four-leaf-clovered rock, and the band's second album, Drunken Lullabies, is a gilded gateway. Once through the door, it's only moments until a listener tries some of the harder, more punk-leaning cultivators of the shamrock sound. Think Boston's beloved Dropkick Murphys and Chicago's Tossers for starters.<br /><br />It makes sense, because Drunken Lullabies is potent stuff. The mish-moshing of traditional Irish folk music with old-school punk may read like a novelty act on paper, but it's a natural pairing.<br /><br />The blighted history of the Irish people -- so-called \\"Europe's blacks\\" -- might as well write front man Dave King's forlorn and fist-pumping lyrics. Meanwhile, razor-edged guitars, a pulsing rhythm section and a brilliant cacophony of traditional, folky instruments lend appealing aggression to what are essentially jig-worthy melodies. It's the favorite Celtic punk cocktail, and Drunken Lullabies mixes a stiff drink that goes down easy.<br /><br />Each song is a call. The most effective appeals include the effervescent, self-deprecating title track, the wistful dirge that opens the otherwise vibrant \\"What's Left of the Flag\\" and the  Near Eastern-tinged menace dripping from \\"Bag of Bricks.\\"<br /><br />Flogging Molly never strays far from what sounds like a singular source vibe, but the end result is an album that's more tight and cohesive than repetitive and boring. It's full of anthemic rallies that incite swaying or pogoing, Guinness or Jameson cocktail in-hand. That's the point of Flogging Molly, after all.<br /><br />If Joe Strummer had been a lad, his band might've sound a bit like this ... when it wasn't the Pogues, of course. ;)
B000002MP2|3.0|Yeah, Dookie is the Green Day album everybody talks about, the one that sold something like 14 million pancakes.  And it unquestionably contains plenty of great songs.  But there are a few songs which are kinda forgettable.  That aside, it's still a great purchase. <br /> <br />Burnout is a fine tune, as is Chump.  But the album really hits its stride with \\"Longview\\", a song that perfectly illustrates the boredom that is suburban teenage life.  That's one of the things I love about Green Day; they write songs that you can relate to.  \\"Welcome to Paradise\\" isn't quite as good, but is still catchy.  \\"Pulling Teeth\\" is AWESOME; you can't help but sing along when you hear that insanely catchy, poppy chorus about a guy getting beat up by his girlfriend.  \\"Basket Case\\": a classic.  'Nuff said.  \\"She\\" boasts another classic punk-pop melody, \\"Sassafras Roots\\" makes me think of summer days, and \\"When I Come Around\\" is the highlight of the album.  It's a cool semi-ballad that still sounds fantastic 11 years later. <br /> <br />After that, the album deteriorates into bland filler for the last 4 songs.  I almost never get past \\"When I Come Around\\".  These songs hurt the album quite a bit, but the strength of the songs before it compensates. <br /> <br />So in the end, what do we have?  2 or 3 okay songs, 7 incredible songs, and 5 filler.  That means that half the album isn't great, which drags the rating down to a 3.  It's still a fine album.  But personally, I believe that Green Day really hit their peak with 2000's \\"Warning\\", a much more eclectic album with absolutely zero filler.  \\"American Idiot\\" was even better. <br /> <br />This CD is more than worth your money.  Some of it is filler, but half the album contains the killer tunes that laid the foundations for punk-pop.  You decide if you want to shell out the cash for the whole album or download those off the net.
B00005JLSE|1.0|This picture is obnoxious and unbearable to watch on the screen.  Show tunes do not translate well to the screen if you're dealing with subpar actors who are not veteran Theater performers.  Watching \\"Singin' In The Rain\\" or any old musical where people are actually singing and dancing with such talent and prestige, no cut-away shots to mask the fact that there is no way in heck the leads could do what they're trying to manipulate, is what I miss.  Gere and Zeta-Jones and Zelleweger couldn't sing or dance to save their lives, but thanks to modern technology we can edit a movie so much to make this bombastic mess, which helps them appear to know how to perform in a play-sorry, no thanks.  The fact that this picture somehow stole the Best Picture from Lord of the Rings (a true masterpiece) is beyond me and makes the Oscars a joke in my opinion.  I couldn't stand this hyper-anxious-cynical take on our world and I don't know why others can.  Remember, that's just my two cents.
B0002EXH4K|3.0|People will often tell you that Countdown To Extinction is Megadeth's best album - Dave Mustaine's very own Black Album, if you will.  In my opinion, they would be incorrect.  Countdown to Extinction is a pleasant enough album, but it ultimately pales in comparision to the band's other albums. <br /> <br />The main problem with the album is that a lot of the songs seem to lack bite.  Yes, the songs are shorter and more concise, but generally they're not the best that Megadeth has to offer (that would be seen on the follow-up, 1994's Youthanasia).  Of course, \\"Symphony For Destruction\\" is the incredible exception to this rule; it's one of the all-time greatest Megadeth tunes, with a simple slamming riff, intelligently political lyrics, a kickass solo and Dave's whiny sneer riding on top of it.  A lot of people don't like Dave's vocals, but I love them, because they're so unique and there's so much attitude in them, yet in a cooler way than James Hetfield's growls, which have become a cliche.  Mustaine's trademark sneer is also put to great use on \\"Sweating Bullets\\". <br /> <br />These two songs are my particular choices for highlights.  \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" is also a pretty great tune.  But the rest of the album sort of seems a little average.  I mean, the tunes are well-constructed, played great, have good lyrics, and show a desire to experiment a little.  So what's the problem?  Well...they just seem to lack a certain something that made Megadeth's other records so powerful.  The imagery on the album looks pretty dark, but there's a real sense of humour here, and while I like that in Megadeth's other records, here it often tends to make the metal noise here seem a little too light and unconsidered.  The music is heavy, but it seems strangely unemotional.  It feels less epic than other Megadeth albums. <br /> <br />I don't know, a lot of people like this album, but I thought it was just okay.  Personally, I like Megadeth both when they did hardcore thrash and when they started to experiment with shorter, catchier songs.  If you're looking for a great Megadeth album of the latter type, I would suggest that you go for YOUTHANASIA instead.  It's a record filled with great metallic hooks (far catchier than on Countdown to Extinction) that pack a real emotional pench.  And unlike countdown, there's almost no filler, just hard catchy song after hard catchy song.
044024157X|4.0|Set in Clanton, Mississippi in 1970, \\"The Last Juror\\" has the characteristic southern flavor of a John Grisham novel. The plot is centered on Willie Traynor, who moves to Clanton for a journalism internship at the county's only newspaper and seizes an opportunity to buy it when the owner dies. While Willie is adjusting to his new surroundings and profession, a heinous rape and murder occurs putting Willie in the spotlight due to his newspaper's juicy expose of the crime. During the trial, Willie's reports earn him a lot of friends, as well as enemies, for revealing facts about the accused killer's guilt. Near the end of the trial, the accused threatens to kill the jurors if they convict him, but he is still convicted and sentenced to life in prison. The plot shifts away from the murder and into the changes Willie makes at the newspaper, around town and in himself. Then the man convicted of the rape and murder gets out on parole after only nine years in prison, and suspense begins as someone starts murdering the jurors from the trial.  The novel has many divisions in its plot. There is the crime and the killer's rich and powerful family whose interaction with the rest of the town reveals elements of southern culture. There is also Willie's newspaper that he transforms from a small daily with low readership to a top-quality and lucrative paper worth $1.5 million. Then, there is Willie's coming of age story involving his development from an immature 23-year-old college dropout to a successful and prominent businessman. While researching for an article, Willie befriends a black woman, who is the juror named in the title. The friendship between a white man and a black woman is taboo for a southern town at the time and is one of the many quirks that makes Willie stand out in Clanton.   Aside from an interesting plot, there is a lull in the reading after the killer is sent to prison. It got so slow that I began to wonder if the rest of the book would be a play-by-play of Willie's life in Clanton, from the new bowtie he buys in town to how he feels about all 88 churches in Ford County. While the details of the everyday life in Clanton are fascinating for a while, it loses steam and is a drag until the murder mystery action resumes towards the end of the novel.  \\"Grisham deserves a winning verdict for [his] latest literary thriller.\\" - Boston Globe  With all due respect to the Boston Globe, the only thrilling feature of this novel is that it has random thrilling surges because the movement of the murder mystery is often paused for multiple short stories of life in Clanton. These epic pauses away from the active plot prevented it from sucking me in from cover to cover as many of his other novels have. If you are looking for a story about southern Mississippi culture sustained by a murder-revenge plot, then you won't be disappointed. However, I think that the portrayal of everyday life in Clanton out-weighs any possibility of labeling this novel an exciting thriller. While this book has the southern roots of any great John Grisham novel, it lacks his usual twisting, can't-put-it-down drama like \\"A Time to Kill\\", \\"The Client,\\" and others.
B000002IGP|3.0|Being a total hair metal fanatic, I had high hopes for this album.  But it turned out to be very...average.  It boasts four AMAZING songs in Round and Round, Lack of Communication, Back for More, and Scene of the Crime.  Each of these tunes boasts hooks that drill inside your head and keep you rockin'.  But the rest of the album is made up largely of bland filler that all sounds pretty much the same and doesn't really stick in your head all that long.  It's pleasant hard rock, but not much else.  The above four tunes are all you really need.
0694013889|5.0|Simply put, before this book we had difficulty potty training my 2.5 year old daughter.  After a few reading of this book, we had a potty breakthrough!  My daughter become more comfortable about the potty and all the bodily function associated with it.   <br /> <br />Knowledge is power, even for a 2 year old.  They have to know what's what on their body and what goes where.  This book is extemely helpful in broaching those subject with your toddlers.   <br /> <br />If you think this book is too explicit, then God help you when it comes time to talk about sex when your kids get older.
0385510454|4.0|John Grisham has slowly drifted over the years from the top notch thriller such as Pelican Brief, Runaway Jury and Rainmaker to this type of novel.  The Broker has interesting characters and Grisham tells a good story, but in the end you realize the book and the characters are easily forgotten.<br /><br />Joel Bachman is a ruthless man who earned a lot of money and could play hardball in Washington like no other yet his family mostly hated him and he had no true friends.  In the Broker, we never meet the ruthless Bachman.  We meet him when he is pardoned by a comically inept outgoing president at the urging of the CIA.  The CIA wants to release the \\"broker\\" and then see who kills him to help them get to the bottom of a spy satellite mystery.<br /><br />Grisham details Bachman's extended stay in Italy while tutors try to teach him the language and Bachman, now called Marco, tries to learn the language and figure out what was happening to him.  The story isn't as boring as some other reviewers say.  Along with Marco in Italy, Grisham keeps the story moving with the CIA working to follow Marco, other spies preparing to kill him, and presidential pardon scandals erupting in the US.<br /><br />The Broker seems mightily similar to the \\"Partner\\" and to some extent the King of Torts.  As a main character, whe only glimpse one side of Bachman although he does get some redemption at the end and tries to do right for a change.  Also, I've noticed that for being such a good writer, Grisham never really includes a romantic angle in his novels.  That's unfortunate because I think that is a key missing ingrediant in his later novels that are primarily character driven instead of plot driven.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The combination of style, Meaningful and powerful lyrics, and some of the best musicians ever assembled into one CD. I guess you could say I'm a little to into this CD but thats what it does it sucks you right in. I guess when you listnen to a song (The Noose) about 13 times in a row you kind of get that feeling. I guarantee that there isn't one person that if given a few listens of the CD wouldn't like every song on this album. It's the definition of a unskipable album.
079073382X|1.0|Now that Before Sunset is out, there's renewed interest in Before Sunrise.  This movie is so shallow, tedious and boring that it should be allowed to die in peace.  Unless you are predisposed to fall in love with Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy, you would be well advised to avoid it.  As an infomercial by the Vienna Tourist Office, this is far more successful than as a movie.  I can only suppose that those who like this movie have never spent a whole night just talking to and being with someone.  Those who have will know how much more interesting that was than sitting through this is.

0385510454|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  I'm a big fan of Grisham's earlier books and had hoped The Broker would be as exciting.  I kept reading and reading and reading, waiting for something to happen.  I thought, surely the ending will bring it all together - wrong!  What ending???  Read this book if you want a vivid description of Bolonga, Italy and Italian language lessons.
B0006399FS|3.0|This is the three starest album of the year, from the three starest band of all time!  If you need to calibrate your CD rating system, get this CD and know what the sound of three stars sounds like.
0385336810|5.0|The beginning of the book was a bit slow for me.  After 30 or 40 pages, I could not put the book down.  Emma is a character that is easy to relate to.  I laughed out loud many times while reading Can You Keep A Secret.  Great read!
014028009X|1.0|Wow. I'll admit I'm not a voracious chick-lit reader and I may be biased that way. I pick up a chick-lit only every now and then after I tire of reading thought-provoking books. The first chick-lit I read was by Meg Cabot and I enjoyed it because it is funny, the character is only semi-shallow, and she at least KNOWS she is semi-shallow. I also enjoyed The Nanny Diaries. <br /> <br />Bridget Jones's Diary, however, has convinced me never to touch a chick-lit again in my life. Bridget has a lot in common with the character from the Shopaholic Trilogy: 1) She is shallow, 2) She is oblivious/stupid 3) Her obsession in her life is very useless and... shallow. <br /> <br />Bridget says in the beginning (I think), that a career woman doesn't need a husband. Yet she contradicts herself by constantly wishing to have sex with her co-worker. It's especially sickening that she doesn't respect herself and lets him sleep with her after only, uh, one date? It's even worse because earlier she refuses to do something just \\"for fun.\\" It only shows that she's becoming that desperate. <br /> <br />Her mother is no better. I find it annoying that all of a sudden she tells her husband that she's tired of being his slave and that she wants to do something better with her life, and that something turns out to be sleeping with other men. Ugh. <br /> <br />To sum up, this book just annoys the hell out of me.
0440178002|5.0|Shogun, written by James Clavell is a great Japanese historical fiction. The book is filled with much information about how the past might have been. How Japan was hostile to foreigners, any kind of foreigner, since they wished to remain isolated from the world, how they thought mostly about honor, loyalty and death, just really how samurai thought back then. I liked the book because I love anime and manga. And since the book was based on Japanese culture, I decided to read it. The theme was quite mature, yet I ignored the inappropriate parts. The book went beyong my expectations and I was quite happy with the ending. How the war was solved and how I predicted it should have been.
0451529308|2.0|I really dont know what the hype is over this book.  Its considered a classic, yet, it is boring reading.  I didn't find any of the characters of any interest and the pace is slow.
B000002WPI|5.0|this cd is just as amazing today as it was when it came out in 1993.  Wu tang is a group of the hardest MC's on the planet and this CD shows us all how insanly good they are.  This has been my favorite CD sence it came out.  I demand all of you buy this CD now
B000065U1N|1.0|Why are the facts of \\"Blackhawk Down\\" viewed as un-American or incorrect?<br /><br />Here's what isn't shown in the movie:  US forces, using incorrect intelligence, raided the UN Development Programme HQ, the Charity World Concern, and the offices of Medcins sans Frontieres (AKA Doctors Without Borders).  They captured multiple _innocent_ civilians alongside the chief of the UN's police force!  When members of the Aideed clan gathered in a building to talk about a peace agreement with the UN the US forces blew them up killing 54 people.  In response the Somalis went nuts with rage and attacked US forces  as our troops began firing missiles into residential areas.<br /><br />The events that occurred are clear. It perhaps be argued that US intentions were good. But the fact remains that the result was bad - for all sides.<br /><br />The soldiers walked into this hellfire of chaos with competing warlords adding fuel to the fire on all sides. Yes, they were brave. They were doing the job they were ordered to do.  And they were placed there by others (Clinton & the Pentagon) who were clueless.  The Somalis reacted with (understandable) rage and contempt. US soldiers were caught in the middle.<br /><br />Not only does \\"Blackhawk Down\\" ignore these facts, it also depicts the Somalis in a specific way. Is there one rioter who is depicted as having human qualities? Isn't it obvious that the movie makers were not interested in any other perspective other than the soldiers?<br /><br />Many reviewers compared \\"Blackhawk\\" to the racism of the 1964 flick \\"Zulu\\" in which thousands of Africans, depicted as mere ants, advanced on a small (and humanized) out numbered British force.<br /><br />None of this has anything to do with being anti-war, pacifism or being \\"anti-American.\\"  This is about propaganda being passed off as \\"truth.\\"
B00005JMK0|5.0|Electric Dreams is a favourite of mine. This is an all time favourite from the 80's. Virginia Madsen was awesome as always and the soundtrack was rad. There is something really enjoyable about this film. It should definitely get a DVD release.
B000268QB2|4.0|They remind me big time of the band Travis (whom I LOVE) but I really enjoyed this record.  If you like music where you can just sit back and get into these cool and relaxed tunes then you'll dig this CD.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I have to give it to Miss E. Badu for she has done it again. I love her in every aspect. So what if the lyrics on this piece wasn't that deep. If you listen with all that you have, maybe you can get more out of the CD than what is surfaced for the everyday ear. Take her advice and PUFF. All of her recordings were great in my soundbook. This is right up there with them because she pays tribute to the first three releases. Yes three. Woo pays tributes to two projects at once. The Song is a jam session (wich goes to the live cd) in wich she goes back to \\"Sometimes... Mix#9\\" (from Baduizm). It gets put behind glass with the rest of the greats.
0201634988|4.0|This is, of course, one of the cornerstones of OOP. This book definitely influenced programmers at all levels and richly deserves the acclaim that it enjoys. <br />However, this book is not for everyone, especially beginners. To be able to get the best out of this book, you need some solid experience in object oriented programming. This book is ideal for people who have been developers and are moving up to designers/architects. The foundation of real world experience makes a very good base for absorbing the experience captured in this book.  <br />This book is not theoretical by any means. In fact, it captures the experience gained by many people in the course of their careers and offers practical solutions to typical problems encountered in software engineering, specifically object oriented  programming.  <br />The material in the book is authoritative and terse and would be daunting to a newbie. Most of the explantions and examples are offered without much ado, and expect a certain level of not just knowledge from the reader but also awareness about practical applications and typical scenarios encountered in practice.  <br />I would say that this book is suitable for full time object oriented programmers (whatever the language) with at least a couple of years of experience looking to further strengthen their knowledge of OOP systems and looking to gain an insight into the practical aspects of how to solve typical situations in real world projects.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|There is a marked difference between Pat Metheny Trio recordings and the larger Pat Metheny Group (PMG), especially in recent years when the group's work has gotton overly ornate and baroque. This release, however, marks a refreshing change. You won't find a lot of straight ahead Metheny solos (as found in the trio recordings), but the sound is less dense, less pop, and more interesting.<br /><br />Gone are the annoying, extended vocalizings that marred the last PMG outing (which I didn't purchase). The recording is, in a sense, orchestral without being pretentious or overbearing. One wished for more Metheny soloing, but we are treated to several classic solos by the master. The music develop over the 68 minutes and seems to incorporate some ideas from previous PMG pieces without repeating the actual songs. Several melodic and themes develop through the work, as well as a kind of percussive pulsation that serves appears in various forms. It is very intriguing. This may be the influence of Steve Reich, who is thanked in the minimal liner notes.<br /><br />Pat might almost be too humble with the PMG. His solos are not mixed very brightly, although they are distinguishable from the other instruments. His playing doesn't exactly explode with new ideas, but is solid and satisfying, nevertheless. The trio formats find him exploring more passionately.<br /><br />Vu provides a refreshing other solo voice on trumphet. Little is heard from the new harmonical player, though, apart from background voicings, and one long melancholic and beautiful solo, I'm curious to hear more. Jazz harmonica is rare.<br /><br />All in all, this is a rich and fascinating piece of music. Thus far, I hear new and interesting things every time I listen to it. There won't be any smooth jazz stations hankering after anything on this CD. For that, I am thankful.
6304698526|1.0|This film won an Oscar for Best Editing! Wow, it must have been a really bad year for editing. This movie wastes so much time it's hard to stay awake at times. There are too many shots that have nothing to do with the movie or develop the plot in any way. There are extended shots of Bullitt ordering at a restaurant, Bullitt buying TV dinners at a grocery store, Bullitt getting breakfast at the hospital, Bullitt talking to his girlfriend about pipe, ahhhh! There are also too many shots of people doing nothing but walking, walking down the hallway, walking down the street, walking through the door, walking to church, walking up the stairs walking walking walking! It is amazing. It takes an hour for the movie to do what should take only 15 minutes.   <br />Probably the cheesiest scene in the whole movie is when Bullitt's girlfriend gets upset after she follows the police into a hotel room and finds him in there with a dead body. (Don't ask me why she does, or why the police just let people on the street follow them into a crime scene.) Well anyway she gets all upset and says \\"I thought I knew you, but I am not so sure anymore. Do you let anything reach you? I mean really reach you? Or are you so used to it by now that nothing really touches you.\\" And goes on and on about how callous he is and doesn't want to be reminded of the world he lives in. <br />Please, give me a break; he is a police officer for heaven sake. They see dead people all the time, and what did she expect, him to break down and cry every time he sees a dead body?  <br />It was a pathetic attempt at sentimentality. <br />The only redeeming qualities of this movie are Steve McQueen's cool acting, the car chase scene and seeing some nice sports cars from the 1960's. <br />But, the plot is so thin if all of the walking, eating and conversations about pipe were left out this movie could have been half as long. This movie reminded me of a bad TV show. <br />I considered giving it two stars just for Steve, the chase scene the nice cars and the film does at times has a nice stylized feel to it. But two stars is just slightly below average and this film is way below average, Perhaps a 1.5.
B0002WZTOI|3.0|I agree with many that TOP GUN is quite dated, has 1986 written all over it but is worth seeing for the fantastic stunts and sky scenes.  This film was made before CGI took over (the good old days).  On its release back in 1986, the film was popular because of the big stars at the time (Cruise, Kilmer and McGillis), the awesome soundtrack and the special stunts.  The plot however was disappointing as well as the poor character development.   <br /> <br />The original DVD release was in the wrong widescreen aspect ratio (2:00), but has been fixed for this new Special Edition by reinstating the correct 2:40 aspect ratio.  In addition, the print has been restored to a degree and it looks fantastic!  The special features are a godsend, including video clips for the key songs, a making of documentary and vintage footage of Tom Cruise speaking about the film in 1986.   <br /> <br />Despite it's downsides, the film is worth seeing.  The new DVD is worth purchasing for it's restoration and impressive special features.  At last, Paramount are starting to do DVD's properly.
B00005JKED|4.0|I generally liked this movie. Good to great performances overall, but hey, look at the car as Denzel is about to get blown away at the end. Funny that not shortly before both the front and rear ends were totalled in the fight scene between him and Ethan. What happened, did he find a body shop in the middle of the night that did perfect work in five minutes? The damn car looks brand spankin new. This is what's always bothered me about \\"Training Day.\\" If you're gonna spend so much time and energy making things realistic, why not cover all the bases?
B0006A9FKA|4.0|With the recent rash of zombie movies popping up recently, it seems only fitting that someone come up with a zombie spoof.  And Shaun of the Dead hits the bullseye.  The situations that the characters find themselves in are very real-world.  You'll find yourself saying \\"That looks like something stupid I would have done\\".  Being trapped inside a car with a zombie because the locks are child-proof is a great scenario.  You and your friends will be talking about the different scenes for weeks.  If the emotional parts were cut out and the movie were a little more \\"spoofier\\" I would give it 5 stars.  But regardless, this is a great movie.  I can't wait to watch it again.
B0006Z2LCE|2.0|Well, these greatest hits albums just don't get it right.  This one unlike the awesome 1993 Anthology seems to favor her 80's work over her (best) work, her work from the 1970's. <br /> <br />I do have to say that having the 6 minute version of MacArthur Park is one plus to this collection, since the single version feels disconnected, missing Part 2 of the song.  But still, for this, go to the 1993 Anthology.  At least that one includes Rumour Has It and Once Upon a Time. <br /> <br />I guess, for those who like her non-disco stuff better, this is for you, so, I guess there's two sides to it.  Personally, though, this one lacks compared to the Anthology.
B0006IIKS0|2.0|I think i could have gotten more into this if the editing had not been so godawful. I spent so much time thinking \\"Oh, Lars's hair is blond and short...wait-it's long and dark....now it's short again!!!\\" that it was distracting. It also made me wonder what else in the movie was taken out of context and why this was done. Too Bad.<br /><br />ALSO, Bob Rock made me sick with every disparaging comment regarding Jason Newsted. He acted as though Jason was a \\"hired hand\\" when he was a member of this band for almost 15 years! I got the impression Bob was sad and jealous that they didn't ask HIM to be the new member. Shame on him.
B000001F9N|5.0|I have to say each and every one of these songs are fantastic.  I can listen to Try Me, I Know We Can Make It over and over, thus in my opinion is the best track on the album.

B00064MW6A|1.0|The only superhero film I have seen that was worse than this was the original Fantastic Four movie. and they had the good sense never to release it. Yes, I'm including Wonder Woman with Cathy Lee.<br /><br />Besides the costume and the walk (hey! I'm a guy, I can appreciate inappropriate sexiness), the single redeeming quality is what is probably an unintentional pun. Sharon Stone with skin as hard as Granite <smirk>.<br /><br />For the record, the Live Action Catwomen are: Julie Newman, Lee Meriwether (the first movie, everyone forgets her), Eartha Kitt, Michelle Pfeiffer, and alas, Halle Berry.<br /><br />I don't fault Halle. The story was weak and ill conceived, the fight sequences were choppy and difficult to watch, and the CGI was pretty poor.<br /><br />Save you money.
B000059TEP|4.0|\\"Titanic\\" was a chick flick. But remember the moment when the stern of the ship is sticking up, and some poor man loses his grip on the stern rail? He falls and falls, spinning, until he smacks into the giant propeller and falls into the icy ocean. Women in the audience say, \\"Oo, the poor man\\"; men in the audience pump their fists and go \\"Yeah!\\" Also, 90 percent of men enjoy the scene where Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio) is sketching a naked Young Rose (Kate Winslet). <br /> <br />Well, in a similar fashion, \\"Ghost\\" is perfect for women, but has some stuff put in just for the men. For guys, there's a shot from behind of a half-dressed Demi; and of course, there's some deliciously nasty violence to the bad guys. <br /> <br />For both men and women, there is the great comedy supplied by Whoopi Goldberg. Pause the movie when they show Oda Mae's mugshot photos -- her hairstyles are a scream! <br /> <br />\\"Ghost\\" came out 15 years ago. Now in 2005, some of the special effects look a little cheesy, and the bank computers -- monochrome screens and a text-based operating system? Sheesh! <br /> <br />I'm still trying to figure out how they did the \\"ghost sits up from his own corpse\\" special effect...
B0006IIPIK|2.0|I was somewhat disappointed with Sky Captain. The plot was confusing, the dialogue seemed like it was written by a dropout student from screenwriting school, the acting was below average, but the atmosphere and style of the movie were original.    The story takes place in the mid 30s in NYC, but has a futuristic feel to it, with rather original robots attacking the world. The special effects are obvious but amazing and very star warsish. I do wish i had seen this picture on a big screen to really get the full effect that was intended. The colors are a dull brownish, as if the look of the film had been inspired by a sepia picture from the time. The picture is not sharp all the time and slightly burry on the edges which gives a warm look to the film.    The beginning of the movie was decent, the middle hour was appallingly bad and boring, the end was pretty suspenseful. Sky Captain is worth seeing but only for pulp comic or science fiction fans that are looking for some originality. I think the movie could have been a lot better had the script been more elaborated and the characters more developed.
B0002858YS|3.0|This CD is very hit or miss.  You either like it, or love it.  The songs are very different from track to track, but eventually blur to sound very similar and get irritating after a while.  Its obvious that this CD is good for two songs; Mr. Brightside and Somebody Told Me, both are great songs, but sound very much like they were covers for 80s songs.  They essentially sound like some of the similar European bands, even though I don't think they are European, like Franz Ferdinand.  They are great to listen to in the car, but not great for working out or doing other types of activities.  This CD adds many different genres together, including Alternative, Rock, Gospel, Indie, and Pop to make a very different sound that most are hearing.  Like I said before, you either like this sound, or you don't, but either way, this is a great CD to get if you find it in the bargain bin.
0679735909|5.0|This book is beautifully and artistically written, it's mentally stimulating and a page turner.  It may be the first time I have found all three in a book.  Get it, read it, love it. <br /> <br />I also bought the reader's guide.  I have to say I didn't find it necessary to enjoy the novel.  However, I did enjoy the background on the author and the additional insight into the book.   <br /> <br />This novel is truly an inspiring work of art.
0792838068|5.0|\\"Leaving Las Vegas\\", starring Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue, is a great hardcore dram-packed film released in 1995.  It received four Oscar nominations, including Best Director (Mike Figgis).  This film follows the lives of Ben and Sera.  Ben's wife and son left him because of his severe drinking habit.  He recently was fired from his job, and now he relocates to Las Vegas to \\"drink himself to death\\".  Meanwhile, he meets Sera, a prostitute equally emotionally dying.  The moment they begin dating, their relationship moves faster than the average couple.  Their chemistry and mutual acceptance proves that they are destined for each other. <br /> <br />Its plot contains heavy depth that keeps the emotional stance intact.  The unique storyline of two people on the verge of death who fall in love makes this film like no other.  This love affair combines passion and darkness that few have made fit together so well.  As the characters fall deeper into their suicidal spiral, the drama continually builds leading to a powerful climax.  The characters' painful pasts gives the film events a more powerful theme.  Such themes offer a more new meaning to Las Vegas. <br /> <br />Nicolas Cage (Ben) and Elisabeth Shue (Sera) are the top performers of this film.  Neither actor had performed in a dark-themed film before.  However, their chemistry between one another and the film proves great.  This would propel their careers to greater levels.  Cage, in his Oscar-winning performance, gives new meaning to the term alcoholic.  His character's witty, charming, and aggressive personality combine well.  His performance proved highly difficult considering Ben was drunk through 99% of the film.  Shue's powerful Oscar-nominated performance (which she should have won) is the breakthrough performance of the year and of her career.  Sera's emotional stance offers new depth territory to the film.  Her deep emotional pain, loneliness, and hardships express themselves in great levels.  Shue mastered acting out many difficult issues and events (rape, assault, harassment, endangerment, and more), which makes this much more amazing. <br /> <br />\\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" is a great film for any hardcore drama fan.  This will surely keep audiences interested for a long time.  Those interested in this film must watch it a few times to fully understand the deep crutial details.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|\\"Collateral\\" delivers an interesting story with a tight pace, with some intense action sequences. It has good acting but does not delve too deep into its characters. And we wouldn't expect it too, because the whole story takes place in the course of one night. However, the cast of characters does make enough interesting revelations about themselves as the movie progresses to keep the plot moving along. <br /> <br />The best part I thought was the action. Tom Cruise plays \\"Vincent\\", a contract assassin who has the good looks of a GQ male model, the suave intellectual capacity of a business negotiator (at one point he dishes out an impromptu jazz trivia about where Miles Davis went to school to learn music), and the deft killing skills of a Navy Seal. There's a really cool scene where he takes out a battalion of bodyguards, cops and hitman in a dance club to finally execute his target. Jamie Foxx is convincing at playing a cabbie going about his daily doldrums, and is gradually pushed past the border of sanity by his involuntary role in a killing spree. He eventually reacts to it in the most heroic and unthinkable way. Foxx is good in this movie, but I'm not sure if he's Oscar-good. <br /> <br />This movie gave me a vibe like \\"Training Day\\", where characters are forced into a situation together, and people begin to reveal themselves bit by bit, as they are not really whom they seem to be. Eventually you know someone is going to be pushed to act totally beyond their normal behavior. The action is intense and tight here too, and definitely kept me at the edge of my seat.  3 & 1/2 Stars.
B0002I831S|5.0|I got this set as a Christmas gift and I hesitated before deciding to write this review.  After all, there's been so much coverage of the Star Trek franchise over the years; why bother?  Two answers come to mind.  I felt it was necessary to pay my respects to the original Star Trek series in the face of 40 years of advancing TV technology.  Also, I think the DVD package itself is noteworthy. <br /> <br />Many critics and even some fans and cast members can find numerous reasons to pan this classic television series.  From the low-budget special affects to Shatner's ego and the sometimes-shoddy camera work, this series is definitely outdated, especially when you compare it to later incarnations in the Trek universe.  Still, any Trekker who knows their history knows that Star Trek was a pioneer in the television universe and overcame many obstacles, including network apathy, cast changes and a tiny budget, before making it to the small screen. <br /> <br />The premise was really a simple one.  A starship crew lead by Captain James Kirk (William Shatner) encountered aliens and various science fiction phenomena each week as they explored the galaxy.  Kirk was a hero in the classic sense; the adventurous, womanizing and sometimes impetuous figure who cut his way into the final frontier.  But this hero was backed up by an unusual figure who actually overshadowed his popularity in TV fandom, Mr. Spock.  Leonard Nimoy plays the alien Vulcan to perfection and provides the perfect logical counterpoint to Kirk's passion.  We also have Dr. Bones McCoy (DeForest Kelley) who acts as Kirk's heart when necessary, and who wasn't always comfortable with the science around him.  Throw in a gruff Scottish engineer, an Asian helmsman and an African-American woman communications officer, and you have a diverse cast that was unheard of in that day and age.  Star Trek wasn't simply a \\"ray gun alien series,\\" as was some of it's contemporaries.  The aliens were often threatening, but weren'toften evil.  The violence wasn't always necessary and the heroes weren't always right. <br /> <br />Star Trek was also revolutionary in some of the science fiction concepts it used in it's TV scripts.  \\"A Taste of Armageddon,\\" focuses on a society that wages a civilized war based on computer calculations.  \\"Devil in the Dark,\\" features an encounter with a life form based on silicon.  \\"City on the Edge of Forever,\\" and \\"Tomorrow is Yesterday,\\" explore the always-popular sci-fi premise of time travel.  But while concepts were always a big part of Star Trek, character was never lacking as evidenced by such episodes as, \\"The Naked Time,\\" \\"The Conscience of the King,\\" \\"The Enemy Within,\\" and \\"The Galileo Seven.\\"  We are also treated to several first encounters.  We meet the sinister Romulans for the first time in, \\"Balance of Terror,\\" the ruthless Klingons in, \\"Errand of Mercy,\\" and Kirk has his first encounter with the genetically engineered Khan in \\"Space Seed,\\" which would be the genesis of the popular 1982 Trek feature film.  All and all, the first season of Star Trek is it's best with the perfect blend of action, character and story. <br /> <br />The DVD package is more creative than most.  I like the hard plastic shuttlecraft case.  The extras rival those of many current day series, featuring interviews with Shatner, Nimoy and many other writers and producers of the show.  I also found it fascinating that the picture is so high quality and the audio is presented in surround sound.  I didn't care for the pop-up text commentary.  I prefer audio commentary as it adds more depth to what the contributor has to say. <br /> <br />I doubt that anyone who didn't have an affinity for the series in the past would be interested in it now.  It's probably up to those of us who are already fans of the series to keep it alive on DVD.  Still, I suspect that, when history makes it's judgment, Captain Kirk and the crew of the original U.S.S. Enterprise will be remembered more vividly than will many of their successors. <br />
B00001OH7O|5.0|This album was and still is a very personal favorite of mine. I'm glad to report that it has stood the test of time. <br /> <br />Many of the reviews here appear to have been written by youngsters who were not around or able to appreciate this masterpiece when it was released. While I'm glad that they are listening, I'm sorry they did not experience Bowie when he first burst on the scene. It's very difficult to convey the brilliance of his string of albums from \\"Space Oddity\\" to \\"Diamond Dogs\\" if you did not hear them first-hand back then. I can only hope that the truly special young listeners who have not been tarnished by rap crap and big-business corporate B.S. nowadays can truly enjoy the stuff when real musicians talented performers actually had a voice. <br /> <br />Needless to say, NO ONE makes music like this anymore. This is when the MUSIC truly mattered. 'Nuff said. <br /> <br />Dave <br /> <br />
B000002U82|5.0|The first time I heard Dark Side of the Moon, I had boughten the vinyl from a kid in my high school art class. I went home and played it, instantly I was floored. The mellow sounds of songs like Us and Them, the funky sound of Money, the incredible vocal solo on Great Gig in the Sky. Never before or after have I heard an album quite like it. Intense yet at the same time soft. Roger Waters' lyrical genius plays out at its best, with myriad questions of life and the world around imbedded in this musical masterpiece. I you dont own Dark Side of the Moon, I highly reccomend buying it. It will change your life.
0385513755|4.0|If you are deciding between the illustrated and normal versions of this book I would recommend the illustrated.  My only complaint about the illustrations is that the \\"last supper\\" is spread out on two pages with the crease in a critical location.<br /><br />The book itself is a fun, fast, interesting read.  I would highly recommend it.  I did like Angels and Deamons slightly better because I felt the \\"bad guy\\" was better developed.  I felt a lot of sympathy for the \\"Bad Guys\\" in this book, which is not necessarily a bad thing.
6305077630|5.0|I just recently saw this movie after hearing a lot about it. I tend to stick with the classics, which include \\"The Breakfast Club,\\" \\"Pretty in Pink,\\" and \\"Sixteen Candles,\\" but thought it would be nice to try another John Hughes movie. I was not disappointed. You can clearly tell it's from the mid-80's, as in one scene of the movie, you see David Lee Roth doing his show DAVE TV, plus the hair and fashions are totally 80's as well. <br /> <br />Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell Smith) are two high school students who feel rejected from the popular crowd, not that they were ever a part of it. They desperately want to fit in and have difficulty doing so. On one weekend, Gary is spending the night at Wyatt's house and gets the idea to create the ideal woman after watching a Frankenstein movie. Wyatt is apprehensive, but it isn't long before they are typing away at their computer, designing the dimensions for their ideal woman, and feed different body parts into the computer. After some major explosions in Wyatt's room, Kelly LeBrock emerges as the ultimate woman. Essentially, in a nutshell, what she does is to show them that standing up for themselves is good, and gives them self-confidence in the process. They really needed this. In certain scenes, Wyatt is quite a looker, but he just needs self-confidence. <br /> <br />I found Bill Paxton's character, Chet, to be utterly hilarious in his delivery and his military-like persona. He is such a bully, but he serves his role well. Robert Downey Jr. is one of the popular punks who helps in dumping a slurpee on Gary in one scene. Love his yellow socks. He has a guy friend who likes to pick on Gary and Wyatt as well, and they have a couple of beautiful girlfriends who actually seem very approachable. They are getting tired of their boyfriends' immaturity and come close to dumping them after the slurpee incident. But in the end, at the party, Wyatt and Gary finally get these girls as a result of their newfound confidence. They actually make pretty cute couples. Love the scene when Chet hits them in the morning with the butt of his rifle.  <br /> <br />This was a great movie, and I am pleased to add it to my favorites of John Hughes movies.
0812550706|5.0|Hands down - this book takes one of the most creative and insightful approaches to decision making that I have ever read and somewhow Card wraps a great sci-fi plot around it.  The author exposes the inner thought process we as individuals in a society experience day to day in making simple decisions. Yet, Card surpasses expectations by creating an environment where childhood innocence is juxtaposed against the psychology of influence we exert on others in making the more challenging moral/ethical decisions required in times of survival.   <br /> <br />Enders Game is one of those rare books I can read 4 or 5 times and still be excited to see what happens each time around. I've heard that various directors are considering turning the screenplay into a movie. I'd love to see it, but can't imagine it would ever be as good as the original book.  BTW, Ender's Shadow is a great follow on read if you're intersted in the same story told from a different perspective.
0684833395|5.0|I just read some of the reviews which give this book only one star, and it amazes me how people can give up on a story just because its not structured like a normal story, and it dares critcize war and the military.  Most people complain that the story had too many characters and no order.  That's the point of the book.  The point was to give the reader a story so adsurd and crazy that in reading it you gain insight into what it may have been like to be serving in the military in WWII or any war for that matter.  I have never served for my country and respect all the soliders present and past who have fought either for America or against it.  Stories like this and Slaughter House 5 really represent how pointless and absurd war really is.  One reviewer said this book was \\"replete with needless descriptions, and depraved immortality.\\"  Funny, I always that war was the best example of depraved immortality.
B000001GRE|4.0|Leave it to enfant terrible Pierre Boulez to come up with the single most radical reading of the Mahler 7th.<br /><br />This is, in every way, as radical a performance as his Parsifal was, and  there may be parallels to be drawn there.<br /><br />Most appropriately (since this IS, along with DLVDE, Mahler's most progressive,finished work and is certainly his most surreal),Boulez approaches this sometimes unapproachable composition as a majestically structured abstract landscape.<br /><br />Many years ago,he gave us a much needed,similar approach to Wagner's valedictory work.<br /><br />It was a no nonsense recording.<br /><br />Atheist Boulez would have none of the psuedo spirituality<br />usually afforded this work and looked it straight in the eye as a modernist musical drama.<br /><br />Boulez has expressed doubts about the Wagnerian texts(just as he has expressed doubts about the vocal works of his one time teacher Messiaen),but not the musical structure and Boulez's Wagner seems to have paved the way for Boulez's Mahler.<br /><br />The two night music movements may lack mystery in the traditional sense, but they do have a Pierrot-like lyricism that suits this performance well.<br /><br />The cowbells in the first night music are merely submerged splashes of color and, likewise, the kitsch elements of the infamous scherzo are  muted, transformed into cool toned brush strokes, bringing a painterly like coherence to the whole (so too with the rondo finale).<br /><br />Of course, we have long had Mahler cycles from Horenstein, Bernstein, Solti, etc that have given us the 'romantic' Mahler.<br />To be frank, the market is saturated with THAT type of Mahler cycle.<br /><br />For me, this is one of THE vital 7ths,along with Scherchen,Barenboim and Klemperer.<br /><br />The completion of Boulez's 'progressive only' Mahler is eagerly awaited, if for no other reason, than as an opposing viewpoint and, as an opposing viewpoint, Boulez's Mahler isn't just a desirable one for the shelf space, it's a damned necessary one.

B0001CNRS4|1.0|Honey is a sickly sweet teen-orientated dance-drama, drawn from the same cheesy mould as Glitter, Showgirls, and Staying Alive. There is absolutely nothing original about this clich-soaked movie, which tells the story of a dancing bartender who dreams of the bright lights.  <br /> <br />Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba) works as a bartender at night. During the day, she also works in a record store, and in the afternoons, volunteers, teaching dance classes to underprivileged urban kids. When not helping to keep street kids off drugs and comforting old ladies, Honey dreams of becoming a dancing superstar.  <br /> <br />After being 'discovered' while dancing in the club that she works at, Honey enjoys a meteoric rise to become the premier hip hop music video choreographer (within a week or two). But alas, the sinister Music Video Director Michael Ellis (David Moscow) begins to drool over the supple and lithe Honey. When the sweet and innocent Honey rejects his advances from her high moral horse, maintaining the movie's kid-friendly rating, Ellis tries to have her black-listed in the industry. Meanwhile, the community centre where Honey volunteers at is being closed. Oh oh, the poor homeless kids will have to put on a show to raise money to keep the centre open . . .  <br /> <br />Gee, I wonder if it will all work out in the end?  <br />
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is commonly said to be one of the greatest movies ever made!  It did horrible at the box-office but in 1995 the VHS stormed the charts as one of the best selling VHS videos of all time.  The classic film is finally on DVD.<br /><br />Andy Dufrense (played by Tim Robbins) is sentenced to life in prison for two murders he didn't commit in 1947.  Of course there's not a soul who believes he's innocent.  Soon Andy meets Red (Morgan Freeman) who is a man who knows how to get things.  There's only one thing Andy really wants, Rita Hayworth.  Andy is a smart man, and when people figure out what it is he's doing with Rita Haywroth, it's far too late for them to do anything about it.<br /><br />You'll notice that The Shawshank Redemption has no choppy, cheesy special effects and you'll notice it doesn't have a lot of humor.  But what you will notice is it has fine performances, a story and the most uplifting message a movie has ever given before.  By Andy not giving up hope, he was able to survive Shawshank, the prison ruled by a sadistic warden.<br /><br />A good story makes a good movie.  Sure it didn't have a lot of special effects, but it had a story to tell, and that story was an uplifting story showing you how far hope can get you.  With a tear jerking ending and stunning revolution, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" really is one of the greatest movies ever made.
0385508417|5.0|Skipping Christmas is a comedy written by John Grisham.  It is set back east in the cold winter holiday month of December.  This story begins when Nora Krank and her husband Luther drop their daughter, Blair, off at the airport.  Blair has joined the Peace Corps and is on her way to Peru to spend her first Christmas away from home.  Nora is a housewife and mother who will miss her daughter very much and cannot stop worrying about Blair's safety.  This exert from the book on page 4 shows Nora and Luther's different personalities:<br /><br />\\"I guess we'd better go,\\" Luther said to his daughter, his only child.  Nora, her mother, bit her lip and nodded and kissed her once more.  \\"Please be careful,\\" she said because she couldn't stop saying it.  They released her and watched helplessly as she joined a long line and inched away, away from them, away from home and security and everything she'd ever known.  As she handed over her boarding pass, Blair turned and smiled at them one last time.  \\"Oh well, \\" Luther said.  \\" Enough of this.  She's going to be fine.\\"<br /><br />  With Blair away, Luther, an accountant, adds up all the money they spent on the previous Christmas.  The total comes to $6,100.00!  The fun begins when Luther decides that he and Nora should skip Christmas altogether this year and instead, take a ten-day Caribbean cruise.  But, skipping the whole holiday season is a little more difficult than they had imagined.  Every other year, all the neighbors decorated their homes and won 1st prize from the city for the best decorated block. This year with one dark house, the prize would be lost.  The Kranks find themselves in one comical situation after another when their neighbors, friends, and co-workers have difficulty understanding how anyone can just skip Christmas.<br /><br />The author's style of writing keeps this book moving at a very fast pace with many delightful twists and turns along the way.  I found it difficult to stop reading and the pages seemed to turn themselves.  Skipping Christmas is a lighthearted easy to read comedy that will be enjoyed by the young and old, alike.  Although this book is set in modern day America, in time, it is sure to be ranked among other classic Christmas stories such as A Christmas Story, A Christmas Carol, and How the Grinch Stole Christmas.  Anyone who has ever faced a crowded mall at Christmastime or has completely drained their finances and energy preparing for this festive season, will understand Luther and Nora's desire to escape it all.  But, as with many of Grisham's other novels, the end of the book holds the heart of the story.ed to turn themselves.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Admittedly this is a strange film about a strange teenager living a strange life in a strange version of Idaho.  But if you just let it be what it is, you will enjoy it.  There are a couple of peaks in the \\"non-action\\" that I think are just riotious fun--and not because I feel \\"superior\\" to Napoleon.  A nice change to movies as usual in my opinion.
B00005JN0T|5.0|Based on a book writtten by the master, Isaac Asimov way way back in the 1940's it would be easy to level some cheap shot criticism at this movie for not being tru to the book... Give me a break ... one should rather be amazed at the absolute genious of the author to forsee our world of the future ...  <br /> <br /> <br />OK so there are some gaping holes in the writing and for the sci-fi analysts this must drive them absolutely NUTS ... good ... for the rest of us we can just sit back and spend an easy going afternoon watching Will Smith in a stupendour 'eye candy' type of action flick. Will Smith playing the paranoid detective Spooner is fabulous .. I truly believe that Smiths artistic work is certainly not appreciateed today ....  <br /> <br /> <br />What a great film and truly enjoyable which is more than I can say for a lot of the fare in the movies today where directors CONTINULLY try to push some political or religious agendy down my throat .... this is what movies are all about .. entertainment ....
B00005JMAH|5.0|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third, and in my view, the best Harry Potter film yet. With a new director at the helm of the series, this is both the scariest and funniest Harry Potter film. Not content to churn out a mediocre sequel in a well-established franchise (which very easily could have happened - just ask George Lucas), we have been treated to a film which pays as much attention to the characters and plot, as it does to its awesome sound and visual effects. \\"Something wicked this way comes\\". <br /> <br />As with its predecessors, The Prisoner of Azkaban is based on the Harry Potter children's fantasy book by J.K.Rowling. I personally think that both the Harry Potter books and movies have been exceptionally successful. For example, it is estimated that there are over 20 million Harry Potter books in print, in 40 languages. Furthermore, all three Harry Potter films sit comfortably in the Top 40 list of the Top Box Office films of all-time. <br /> <br />With The Prisoner of Azkaban, Steve Kloves returns as the screenwriter, adapting Rowling's work. Kloves understandably dispenses with a few of the book's subplots and rather focusses on the action, suspense, and mystery elements of the books. Film, after all, is a visual medium, and while The Prisoner of Azkaban is the least faithful adaptation of the three, it is easily the best. Kloves has chosen to focus on the themes and characters of the book, rather than just the events of the book. <br /> <br />With Chris Columbus' departure, and with Mexican, Alfonso Cuarn climbing into the director's chair, it would have been easy for Cuarn to take a safer path, and churn out a mediocre sequel in a well-established franchise. Cuarn, best known for his sexy, R-Rated, threesome road-movie, Y Tu Mam Tambin, steps out on his own, however, and provides a much darker and grittier film. Consider for example, Cuarn's presentation of Hogwarts School, and its aging, creaking, and creepy buildings, comparedto Columbus' vision. Cuarn has an impressive visual style, and yet he directs with subtly when required. <br /> <br />Interestingly, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire began filming in March this year, with Kloves returning as the screenwriter, and Mike Newell taking over the directing reigns. Newell is best known for Four Weddings and a Funeral and Mona Lisa Smile. <br /> <br />As for the plot of The Prisoner of Azkaban: Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and the students of Hogwarts are horrified to hear that the infamous murderer, Sirius Black (Gary Oldham), has managed to escape from the formidable Azkaban Prison for Wizards and Witches. Guarded by the fear-inducing Dementors, no one has ever previously managed to escape from the prison. Black is implicated in the murder of Harry's parents, and he also holds Harry responsible for the death of his evil Master. Many believe that the truly awful Black is intent on killing our young Harry.  <br /> <br />While on the surface, The Prisoner of Azkaban is about the devilish Black's hunt for Harry, Kloves' well-written script, under Cuarn's direction, allows the film to explore the book's themes of growth, maturity, and teenage angst. The film never forgets how crap it can be to be a teenager at times.  <br />
B000002KB8|5.0|This is truly the best of the best. The start of heavy Metal that would determine many new things to come. Once you hear the title track you know your in for a wild ride. Ozzy Osbourne's vocals are the best in this album. The stepping stone that would lead to Paranoid. I have heard many metal and rock bands, old and new, ex. Judas Priest, AC/DC,S.O.A.D., Metallica etc. and this album shows that its the foundation for most of these bands. I own the black box which features all eight Ozzy-era Sabbath albums and this one is truly the best. <br /> <br />By the way, to the guy that reviewed this album from compton, Korn looks up to Ozzy and Sabbath. I am a huge korn fan myself, but if you bother to know the band better, you would know that they are planning to do a cover from Ozzy Osbourne's solo career, (Diary of A Madman). Don't disrespect the classics.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|I'm an Eric Clapton fan and have been for a (very) long time, so it was with great anticipation I waited for this DVD to wing its way to me.  I wasn't disappointed... I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br />Unfortunately when you live in Oz the odds of an event like this ever happening downunder are very long indeed, so I'm happy someone recorded it.  <br /> <br />Some other reviewers were lucky enough to be there, and it was through them I realised Jeff Beck had not been included on the DVD.  That was disappointing. <br /> <br />I s'pose you can only review a disk for what's there, so I can tell you the DTS sound is great and the talent is excellent.  I did find the out of sequence performances irksome though. <br /> <br />I'm happy that my dollars may have helped the Crossroads cause, and if another DVD turns up with the stuff that got left on the cutting room floor, I'll gladly pay my money again.
0060516402|5.0|This book reminds me of the hero in the classic Greek tragedy.  The hero is always magnificent, but has a tragic flaw.  This is a magnificent book with a tragic flaw.<br /><br />Porras and Collins set out to write a book about visionary companies, and they did just that.  They chose the companies they would study based on specific, detailed criteria.<br /><br />They wanted to study companies that had been premier institutions in their industries and widely admired while they made an imprint on the world around them.  They wanted their companies to have multiple generations of chief executives and to have gone through multiple product or service lifecycles. And they wanted the companies to have been around for a long time - founded before 1950.<br /><br />They compared each of their visionary companies with another company that was not a premier visionary company.  Many of the comparison companies were solid performers.  They were good companies, but not great companies.  That's one of the great things about the book.  You can see the distinction between good performance and great performance.<br /><br />Another thing that makes the book great is the extensive research.  The project took six years, and the authors and their research team dug into critical issues and came up with fascinating insights and comparisons.<br /><br />Read this book and you will learn about the characteristics of great companies that have an impact on the world around them.  The discussions will enrich your understanding of what makes a great company.  This will be especially valuable to you if you're in the process of building a company that you want to be great.<br /><br />That's the great part, the hero part.  What about the flaws?<br /><br />The first flaw is that essentially performance for each of these companies is equated with market performance.  There are lots of things the authors could have used, such as return on assets, for example.  But share price is easy to track over time and is used as a surrogate for greatness.  I'm not sure that that's the best criterion.<br /><br />What you are actually reading about is a selection of excellent, visionary companies that were perceived as good investments by the market.  This \\"perception\\" issue is not addressed in the book.<br /><br />The second flaw is more important.  While this book tells you marvelous things about companies that are admittedly great and about some of the things that make for greatness in companies, and while it mixes statistical data with telling anecdotes, it falls short in one critical area.  The book doesn't tell you anything about how to achieve greatness.<br /><br />In other words, it describes what greatness might be and it gives you some examples of companies who have achieved it, but the book ultimately left me with the nagging desire that the authors would have given me some \\"how to.\\"  As far as you can tell from reading the book, these companies were always great.<br /><br />That may not be a problem for you if you're just starting a company.  You've got a clean slate to start from.  But if you're guiding an already-established company, or a part of it, I think you'll wish for a few examples of companies that became great after performing at some lesser level.<br /><br />That's the bottom line in my recommendation.  If you're looking for a book that describes greatness and where you'll pick up a wealth of ideas and good historical knowledge about great companies, buy this book.  If, on the other hand, what you want is a book that describes in some detail how to achieve that greatness, this may not be the book for you.asy to track over time and is used as a surrogate for greatness.

B000683VI4|4.0|I must stress to you my belief in that the 'romantic comedy' is pretty much the worst creation of mankind. Some may argue that religion or the atom bomb are more destructive but the romcom (ugh!) is consistent proof that the public are idiots willing to fork over cash multiple times for the same old, same old crap. We very rarely get a sincere romance film, they kinda died out in the forties and have struggled for breath since.<br /><br />I liked A Walk to Remember a lot and felt obliged to check this out (because it's from a book by the same writer). That obligation turned out to be quite rewarding as this sober, mature film was everything zillion dollar attempts to make us cry (I'm subtly referencing Pearl Harbor) were not. It's all about character and the guts and imagination to tell a good story.<br /><br />Noah is a simple 17-year-old lumberyard worker. He's cocky, arrogant but very good-natured and he quickly attaches himself to Allie, a girl from the city, from Old Money and a fussy family who condemn her relationship with Noah. This is all told in flashback as old Noah (James Garner) reads from his book of youthful memories. Yes, this part is nothing original but the conviction by the cast make it astonishingly real and believable. The performances all round (but especially from Gosling and Rachel McAdams) give The Notebook a strong edge over most attempts at romance. You can literally feel their urge for each other and are involved with them all the way. 'Will she or won't she' plot lines have been done to agonising death so credit must be given Nick Cassavetes (who you'll probably best remember as Castor Troy's bald pal from Face/Off) for pulling it off so eloquently.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that you give The Notebook a try. Even if your a hardened 300-pound muscle-man who's afraid to love it's still worth it. But I must warn you, if your the kind of person who breaks down in uncontrollable crying at the end of Bicentennial Man (err...) you must know that The Notebook ends very similarly. So if your lip quivers easily, watch it alone.<br /><br />The DVD is in gorgeous-looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen that perfectly shows off the wonderful cinematography and warm color pallete of the film. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is most unsophisticated but considering the nature of the film, that is to be expected. Extras include, 2 Commentaries by director Nick Cassavetes and writer Nicholas Sparks, 12 Deleted Scenes, featurettes on Cassavetes and Sparks, 'Locating The Notebook' Featurette, Casting Noah and Allie Featurette, Rachel McAdams Screen Test and the Trailer.ust know that The Notebook ends very similarly.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I love Christina's voice. Period. I loved first seeing her on the Reflections video and have liked all her singles. I bought Stripped when I heard Dirty. I liked the song and wondered if Xtina was going R&B but she wasn't. That didn't mean I didn't like the CD. While the heavy rock stuff wasn't my thing, Christina's voice is like Mariah's where anything is good.   At this time I am listening to the CD and it gets better with every listen. Christina is going to be a LEGEND in time... watch! She will be compared to Whitney, Mariah, Ckaka, Aretha, Patti, Celine, and Barbara as the greatest female singers of all time!  What makes this CD so fabulous is the suprisingly deep and personal lyrics for a pop artists! She really is reinvinting herself whereas Brittney just does shock value. Christina is truly talented!   My favorites tracks are: Voice within(awesome vocals), Loving me for me, Hold us down, Dirty,Walk away, Impossible, and Get mine get yours.  Christina Aguilera I can't wait to cop your third album which is supposed to be more soul/blues!
B00004U2G4|5.0|This is a brilliant album!    What's more my wife hated it... all the better.    Jeff Beck's guitar work is excellent, with the charismatic Ron Wood on bass and Rod Stewart (version 1),  vocals, Micky Waller drums.    Sometimes I think Jeff Beck has been a forgotten guitar hero not really receiving the accolades he deserved.     If you enjoy the stuff by the Faces and early Rod Stewart, then you'll like this.
0066620996|5.0|There aren't many authors who have written two great business books.  Jim Collins can make that claim.<br /><br />The first one, co-authored with Jerry Porras was Built to Last:  Successful Habits of Visionary Companies.  In that book, the authors took a look at companies who'd had long-term success , drew some conclusions about what they had in common and compared them with other companies who were good, but not great.<br /><br />That was good.  It just wasn't enough.  Built to Last didn't tell us how companies moved from mediocrity to greatness.  That's what Collins chose to study and to write about in his second book, Good to Great.<br /><br />In both books, Collins' research follows a strict regimen, using the public record, to identify companies that meet specific criteria.  For this book, those criteria help Collins identify eleven companies made that switch from mediocrity to greatness.<br /><br />The ultimate measure of mediocrity and stunning success is stock price.  Each company that Collins studied went along for years with ho-hum stock performance.  Then, all of a sudden, the curve shot upward.  The question Collins asks for us is: \\"What did they do that made such a dramatic and long term difference in the stock price?\\"<br /><br />With the list of companies established, Collins and his research team start looking at the histories of the companies, searching for clues about what the companies did to generate the change in their performance.  The major tool here is coverage in the business press.<br /><br />This gives us two very different kinds of research.  The first phase, where companies are identified based on specific criteria that are solid and easy to verify.  Stock price is the measure.  The price was this and then it shot up to that.  You might join me in wishing another measure of success had been used, but there it is.<br /><br />The second phase is informed interpretation.  The research involved reading everything the team could find about the key companies and then talking about what they found.  Patterns began to emerge.  Those patterns turned into \\"findings.\\"  Most of them make sense to me.<br /><br />For example,  \\"A Culture of Discipline\\" and  \\"The Hedgehog Concept\\" make sense based on  his team's analysis but they also makes sense to me based on my experience, working with companies for over thirty years.<br /><br />A couple of the findings seem to owe as much to the fads of the day as they do to research.  The material on technology accelerators, for example, probably wouldn't have been in the book if the book had been written in 1981.  Today, though, if you write a book about business, technology is one of the lenses you look through.<br /><br />Then there is Collins' material on Level Five Leadership.  This seems like the part of the book where the consultant comes up with some \\"system\\" upon which to base workshops, licensed training and other such profit builders. This material is mostly solid, but nothing radically different from most of writing about good leadership.  The one exception is also the part I have a problem with.<br /><br />Collins identifies \\"humility\\" as a characteristic of a Level Five Leader.  I don't think his data support that.  The people he describes seem no more or less humble than any other group of high achievers.  Where they differ from many of today's most celebrated CEOs is that they clearly are more concerned with how their company does, than they are with how they look on the cover of Business Week.  I would have been more comfortable if he'd described the CEOs of his eleven companies as \\"results-focused\\" or \\"company-focused\\" and then compared them to star-type CEOs.<br /><br />These are small nits to pick on an excellent work.

B00064ADR0|5.0|I must agree with other reviewers Second Winter was Johnny at the top of his Columbia (pre Blue Sky) era and my personal favorite from this his rock/blues period.  This Legacy Edition is a must buy for anyone/everyone considering/loving Johnny - \\"You Know It's True\\"  The added live CD is PRICELESS.  BUY THIS CD, You will not be dissapointed, even if you already own a previous release of Second Winter.    The live CD features a young Johnny ALL OVER the fret board.    Johnny Winter IS THE ALL TIME BEST ROCK BLUES GUITAR PLAYER/SINGER BAR NONE.  Jimi Hendrix is his only rival and if Jimi had survived he could have possibly had the catalog of recordings that Johnny has produced.  I have listened to Johnny for going on four decades now.  I saw him perform in the seventies and I saw him perform two months ago.  What makes Johnny a living legend, besides his gifted talent, is his ability to consistently produce recording after recording that remain fresh, vibrant and of course full of guitar playing that absolutely no one can match.  If you want to test my statement purchase any Johnny Winter recording that he had any say in releasing and listen to it.  They are ALL excellent.  You will never get tired of his guitar and his voice can not be matched by anyone, not even Edgar.    I have read comments that Johnny's rock stuff is generic.  I beg to differ here.  The Second Winter lp is proof of this.  Johnny Winter was playing guitar at rocks beginnings.  He played/jammed with Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, played Woodstock, with Bloomfield, Rick Derringer and a host of others.  Lennon and the Stones wrote songs for him.  He survived his drug addictions of the 60/70's that claimed the lives of so many greats and lived to play and sing about it.  Listen to the LP, Still Alive and Well.  Those are not just lyrics in songs that sound good like the music of today, that is Johnny singing about his reality.  If you see Johnny only as a blues man you are right, but no one rocks or rocks the blues like Johnny.    Second Winter contains the definitive studio version of Johnny B. Goode.  Memory Pain is the difinitve power blues number.  If you have not heard Johnny's version of Bob Dylan's, \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", well, you have not heard slide guitar yet.  The guitar work on \\"I Hate Everybody\\" one of my personal Winter favorites is so smooth it still sends shivers down my spine.  Johnny may not get credit for starting the power blues movement, but the band of Second Winter certainly defined power blues and set the bar for everyone then and since.    Remember Muddy...  \\"The Blues Had A Baby And They Named It Rock And Roll\\"  ... in my book they named him Johnny Winter.    Don't get me wrong, Johnny's element is the blues.  Heck, just ask Johnny.    Johnny is the king of the white bluesmen.  If you understand that blues is more than playing certain cord progressions and licks you will realize that Johnny Winter is the only true white (and I mean really white) bluesman.  Truly a living legend.    If you love the blues and like to rock, buy Johnny's CDs you will love them all.  If you want more blues than rock buy, The Progressive Blues Experiment, his first Columbia recording, \\"Johnny Winter\\", and everything that is still available that Johnny had a say in releasing after the Blue Sky release, \\"Captured Live\\".  You will miss some good blues stuff but you will avoid Johnny's anything but generic \\"ROCK N' ROLL\\"    An obvious fan.
B000099T2L|5.0|I am a Destiny's Child fan but I know talent when I see it. Beyonce is a star no doubt. She has Grammy's and #1 hits to prove it. Her voice is a unique gift and she uses great control. However, it does take a few listens to grow on you. When i downloaded this cd (shame on me) I thought it was awful. I guess I was thinking it was DC part 2 since she basically sang all the leads on their albums. The album is soulful and energetic, even the ballads shine! Standouts are: Be with you, Yes, Closer I get to you, and the erotic Speechless! <br /> The only spots that were bad were Hip Hop Star and all the 'zodiac signs' songs were skipped but thats just me. I hope to hear more from her and shame on Destiny's Child for only releasing a cd with only 11 songs.
031286504X|5.0|This story is the most brillant book ever written about vampires , but it is not really about vampires. It's about being an outcast in a society. The book is difficult to categorize, it is not really horror, not really suspense but it has many aspects of each type of story.<br />It very easy to see how Matheson inspired many of the horror we like today like King.
0142000663|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath is a powerful, heart-wrenching story of a migrant family's struggle to find a better life in the \\"Promised Land.\\" It begins with Tom Joad getting out of jail on parole, and coming home to find that his family was moving west to get out of the Dust Bowl.<br /><br />Believing that California would be the land of opportunity, they left Oklahoma in search of a better life. The journey was difficult, and the difficulty they faced did not end as they entered California. Rather than finding themselves in the land of opportunity, they had to endure horrible living conditions and low wages.<br /><br />Throughout all of this, Tom Joad is running from the law because he violated his parole by leaving California. Although he has broken the law, he dedicates his life to doing good. The lives of the Joad family are filled with overwhelming disappointment and anguish, but there is a small spark of hope for the future and for humankind which transcends this sorrow.<br /><br />The story will captivate you, but to appreciate this masterpiece you must read his words, not only his ideas. The Grapes Of Wrath is not just a novel; it is a flawless piece of artwork filled with figurative language, brilliant characterization, illustrative description and euphonic, melodious words. The structure of the story is very interesting as well. There are interchapters, short stories giving some background about this time period, woven throughout the entire story, and they are reflected in the later chapters.<br /><br />This was the most interesting and most beautifully written story that I've read in a long time. Buy it.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I absolutely loved this film. It's so raw, yet it feels like a velvet dream. I've watched my copy twice so far, and each time I couldn't stop thinking about it for days afterwards. When I showed it to my dormmates, you can probably guess what happened...ZZZZZZZZZ. I guess some people just want that prepackaged, high-strung drama, or the gut-busting comedy. \\"Bill Murray is in it? Cool!\\" Ten minutes later... \\"What the hell is this?\\"    On that note, Bill Murray's deadpan portrayal of a burned-out actor looking for a few quick bucks is dead on. The commercial and photo shoot scenes are hilarious, and it's very entertaining to watch \\"Bob Harris\\" cope with jet lag.    This is a bedtime/relaxation movie, no doubt. It's so soft and surreal that it fades from your memory, no matter how hard you try to hang on to it, like some wonderful dream...
B000088E6D|5.0|Who would have thought that suddenly there would be a rush of new-age lounge music? Buble brings the rat-pack alive again with the self-entitled album \\"Michael Buble\\". Maybe it's the lack of originality (being that all the songs are covers) or maybe it's the way Buble sings them that makes a girl swoon and want to listen to him over and over again. \\"Moondance\\" is my personal favorite, and \\"A Little Thing Called Love\\" makes me wish I joined swing choir back in high school! This album delivers, and I cannot wait for \\"It's Time\\" to come out!
B0007GBBVO|3.0|Well, the previous review here covers all the main points that need to be made.  This DVD looks better than any of the other 3-D DVD's I've seen, partly due to the fact that it's not a bootleg burned from a VHS or VHD source.  On my copy the frames flipped into reverse location a couple of times, but only momentarily.  Lil' Dracula was a high point to a goofy little movie.  If this is the first in a series of Charles Band product, bring on Metalstorm and Parasite.  And do 'em right because I've got decent DVD-R's of those two.
0385513755|4.0|I was glad that Dan Brown decided to come out with a \\"Special Edition\\" with pictures. It made the reading a bit easier (Easier to picture the place/views in my head). I really enjoyed this book. And would highly recommed it. I can't wait till the sequel comes out!
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise make a surprisingly electrical pair. They make a typical Hollywood action/drama fairly liveable. Michael Mann's shots make it  watchable. Unfortunately the screenplay sometimes takes a turn for the HIGHLY predictable. You will surely know what the final showdown will be before it happens. And when you can tell that the movie wants you to be all like, NO WAY, and you're all like, SAW THAT COMING BEFORE I FINISHED MY HOT DOG, that is a bit of a cinematic failure.  <br /> <br />Other than that it is a beautifully shot, well acted, concentrated study in tension.
B0002VL0KQ|1.0|Lets get this straight.  Many have called Celine a great 'vocalist\\" - to be a vocalist you have to stretch your range and song selection - two things that Celine does not do.  This album is Celine's attempt at doing just that - with failure.  Back in 1997 Barbra Streisand released \\"Higher Ground\\" - like many times in her career she took a chance.  One of the most brilliant cuts from that album was \\"If I Could\\" - perfect rendition.  Along comes Celine and once again tries to compete - not possible.  Celine's version is forced and nothing short of insincere.  Please, I am not anti-Celine - but I am sick and tired of her being compared to this Diva or that Diva - she is a Diva in her own right. But compare her properly to Whitney and Mariah - POP DIVAS - she is not (and never will be if she continues to market herself commercially) a vocalist.  I say let her next foray into her career present Celine with a challenge to her vocal ability - she is still very young and allowed a few crappy albums - Lord knows even the best (ie. Streisand, Rondstadt, and Lena Horn) have had their flops.  This is definately one of Celine's.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|After reading so many comments and reviews about The Way Up on Amazon, Blogs or music sites I wanted to share something that has not been discussed very often in the reviews about The Way Up and that is the work involved in learning to listen to this and in appreciating it's complexity and ultimately its incredulous and undeniable beauty; you've got to take it apart and listen carefully to pieces of the whole as some moments and phrases come easier than others.  Some are subtle and others grow in increasing buildup or decline and then segue into a larger idea. This kind of work is really no different than dissecting a symphony with all its nuances, moments, rises and falls, solos, recording and mixing elements. This does take time to learn!  It is with this kind of personal work that you do that The Way Up earns its rightful place inside the history of music.  This is an impeccable dialogue of expression but you've got to do some work to understand its speak!   <br /> <br />And come on -- is there any artist alive today  - pop or jazz or rock or in any other idium that even hints at this kind of work to revel the pleasure of the compositon and of the artist?  I think not!  And there is excellence in music today as well as crap. <br /> <br />Certainly not everyone has an interest or need to do this kind of work.  But I do want to really hear this thing.  And I can promise any listener whether new to this sound or well acquainted with Pat Metheny is such an enjoyable journey if you attempt this.   <br /> <br />And the negative critics of which there are a few; let's be honest here- can at least be satisfied that they tried.  Others for whom this work represents something more personal to them will truly enjoy this listening and learning process.  In my view this is a necessary endeavor if one truly wants to hear this.  Other wise you could be missing out on the greatest of all possibilities - a greater appreciation of these men's minds and the creativity that they themselves worked so hard to create.    <br /> <br />Take, for instance (and this is just one example that I personally like) around the 20 minute mark in part one it begins with a light guitar solo somewhat similar to Bright Size Life or even kinda September 15th then moves into this incredible collage of sounds and hooks and phrases that even contain, I think, a phrase from a previous piece tho I cannot identify from where (but I will).  How this segment earns its place inside The Way Up and how to appreciate what comes before and what follows has been such a fun experience for me.  You listen to a segment then back up and learn how this fits in and then what comes after and how that moment or phrase or section fits inside the whole so far.  Then listen to the `Part' you're in and listen again and again and then move on.  And then return.  I mean, do the work and you'll then begin to appreciate exactly how masterful this really is.  Then when you have the time to listen to the whole 68 minutes and 13 seconds you will feel the pulse and see the colors and feel a kinship with the composition. <br /> <br />Can you imagine if you like this record now how much more you will get it once you take it apart?  That's what is required here.  And this will never come to all who listen - only to those to whom this means something - It's just not meant to be a pallette that everyone is invited to, well yes invited to, but not all will hear the call.  And that is ok! <br /> <br />This is a piece with many, many, many elements that combine to make the whole.  And if you happen to be sitting in a concert hall over the next few months and are watching this Live as this is unveiled to you as a whole work those moments that you have so enjoyed discovering because of your work you will have a personal attachment to its joy?  I know I want that kind of exhilarating experience. <br /> <br />Take this apart!  Ironically, the separations in the CD make the job easier than it could have beenif it really were all one uninterrupted 70 minutes.  And there are 'songs' and it does have purpose and there is a point to it and it is unique and it is not `derivative' (whatever that means) and it is just an amazing pleasure.  It does not have to be listened to in its entirety every time you want to listen to it!  Why?  Let the thing earn your mind.  Let it resonate inside and add a moment or two and let it settle.  What else do you have to do?  As long as you profess being a Pat Metheny fan or appreciator of this sound and there are many other adjectives that describe; you know them all -- just do the work and in its time The Way Up will be revealed to you.   <br /> <br />What a marvelous way to listen to music that makes this kind of demand.   Me thinks that the `secret' that enduring fans have been keeping to themselves about Pat Metheny just may be over - I cannot remember any time during the Groups' career of nearly 30 years (and I've been with them since 1978) that so much has been written about one single record of The Pat Metheny Group and therefore more attention, more critique, more praise, new fans and as such a larger base of pleasure seekers. <br /> <br />Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.... <br />
B00005JMJ4|1.0|\\"In America\\" should have won.That movie is far superior than this one.But enough about that.This is how \\"Lost in Translation\\" goes.Two Americans saw each other in an elevator and smiled at each other.Then they met again,this time they talked.Then they decided to meet each other again.During those meetings,Scarlett's character seem to always flirt with Bill's character (maybe if he's not a \\"celebrity\\" she would'nt even do that).Until one day,its time for Bill to go,Scarlett is sad,before separating he whispered to her,the end.That's it!You think this movie is smart?That's funny,I didnt know a lot of you have the intelligence of a 13 year old.I'm a fan of \\"lost souls looking for purpose\\" movies since im going through that and I was expecting to get and learn something from it and I did'nt.I thought the highlight of the film is when theyre lying on the bed and finally they get to tell each other their issues but of course they didnt really do that (I guess they just quit since they can't really tell each other what's bugging them anyway) and its quite unsatisfying. Yeah there are some happenings in the movie but they dont really help.No character development,it just goes on and on.This is a real dissapointment.I expected a lot from this because im a Bill Murray fan (and im aware that this is not your typical Bill Murray flick) and I wished that he won the Oscar because he may never be nominated again,but that was before watching this movie,now,Im glad Sean Penn won.This movie is not \\"deep\\",smart nor very artistic and those people who thinks that, probably didnt see a lot of really good,deep,intelligent and artsy films.This movie isnt one of the worst films ever though it didnt live up to its promise.       I dont think its a matter of getting the movie,sure I got it.But as I said,this movie is not deep or smart or incomprehensible,its just that,I never felt anything for these characters nor the movie itself.I really couldnt care less about these people.Sorry!
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|Painful to watch, poorly done, you'll keep looking at your watch - could have been awesome. I made the mistake of buying this dvd before seeing it. Do NOT buy this movie unless you have seen it, trust me on this.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Apparently about 80 percent of Americans look at a clown and think, \\"he has crazy hair, a wacky suit, oh and those shoes, oh boy, look at him dance... this is the most HILARIOUS thing I have ever experienced.\\" The other 20 percent of us look at a clown and think \\"a guy in a clown suit... this is lame.\\" <br />
B00005JLXE|2.0|I'm not a big fan of comic books to begin with, though I can appreciate the artform, and I find this recent trend of taking old Marvel serials and transposing them onto the big screen to be uninspired and annoyingly unoriginal. In this pic, the Daredevil is a mild-mannered attorney by day, crimefighter by night, who leaps and soars and pirouettes with the greatest of ease despite the fact that he's blind. In this film, our hero decides to pick a fight with the local crime syndicate's kingpin, and the ensuing battle of good v. evil plays out to it's predictable conclusion, with lots of leaping about rooftops and breaking of glass [and you have to have the obligatory sharp cocktail party along the way, where all the characters, good and evil, dress up and insult each other while maintaining good manners]. The visuals relating to the way in which the Daredevil \\"sees\\" the world around him [using his acute, overly attuned other senses to create images in his mind] are really fabulously done. That's the high point of the film. The low point is Affleck, who is stiff as a board and inexcusably hollow. His co-stars are a little more useful - Jennifer Garner certainly is nice to look at, and Colin Farrell seems to be having more fun than anyone as the weasly assassin Bullseye - but they can't make up for Affleck's non-compelling lead. Whereas the original comic books deal with complex, paradoxical characters - superhuman on the outside, fragile on the inside - directors of these big-budget flics seem to be way, way, WAY too interested in special effects and style, and almost any film where style trumps substance is bound to be mediocre, at best. The Daredevil keeps insisting \\"I'm not the bad guy,\\" and Daredevil is not a bad movie. But it's close.
0140544518|5.0|I believe that everyone has at least one favorite children's book.  It may be one that brings back a good memory of being read to, or it may be one that can still put a smile on your face and make you laugh.  For me, one of those books is The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs! written by Jon Scieszka and illustrated by Lane Smith.  I first read this book about thirteen years ago when my mom bought it for me.  Nothing at that time could have made me happier than this book.  The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!  is a hilarious retelling of the classic The Three Little Pigs.  Only this time, the story is told from the perspective of the \\"Big Bad Wolf\\", named A. Wolf in this story.  A. Wolf's version tells all about his side of the story.  At the beginning of this book, A. Wolf explains, \\"I don't know how this whole Big Bad Wolf thing got started, but it's all wrong\\".  A. Wolf says that all he was trying to do was borrow a cup of sugar from the pigs so that he could bake his dear old granny a birthday cake.  It was all a big misunderstanding, at least according to A. Wolf.   <br />     Not only is this one of the best written children's stories I have seen, it is also one of the best illustrated.  The author Jon Scieszka is known for his off-beat children's books, and I think they are an excellent way to get children to read, because he makes his stories so much fun for all ages.  I am now twenty-one years old and just re-read this book and it still made me laugh out loud.  As a child, I could not get enough of this book.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a good laugh, and who doesn't want that? <br />
0767834739|1.0|The first movie was very good although it did not have the same impact as the game did. This sequal however was the worst piece of storytelling I have seen on screen. <br /> <br />Don't waste your money...
055357342X|5.0|This is the best fantasy series I've come across. A plot that inspires vivid imagery, characters that amaze you with their depth, and a writing style so complex and artful, it pulls the reader effectively into the story. In a word...gripping. <br /> <br />The only downside is the waiting for the last 3 books. Martin apparently finishes one book in the epic every 3-4 years. After reading his first three, I can understand why. Still...more please!

B0006IIPIK|2.0|I have no idea how a movie with such a large budget like \\"Sky Captain\\" gets the green light to go forward.  The movie takes you on a whirl-wind trip from New York to Nepal to a hidden island in the Atlantic with the purpose of saving the world from a mad scientist.  Setting aside the fact that this is a tired plot, there is no convincing motivation for the scientist's actions.  Supposedly he is building a space ship to function as a Noah's Ark in order to start a new world, but he is going to blow up the Earth just for spite?  The movie does capture that 1930's Buck Rogers feel quite well-perhaps a bit too well with bad acting and cheesy special effects brought along as well.  Jude Law is poorly cast as the lead hero.  He is completely unconvincing as an action star. Of course, his character bumbles through the movie and needs saving several times.  I've never seen a lead action hero accomplish so little in a story.  Gwenneth Paltrow plays an annoying career-driven reporter and her acting is surprisingly bad.  Angelina Jolie is competent is a very minor role.  Not only was I disappointed with this movie, but also bored as well despite all the action.  This one is not even worth renting.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|Some friends of mine rented this movie and supersize me and brought it over to watch, choosing the lesser of two evils (we had just eaten dinner) we opted for this flick.  While I will admit there were a couple parts where I was forced to laugh at the sheer stupidity of the characters, this ranks right up there with Blair Witch Project where I kept expecting it to get better.  My problem with this movie is that I felt like I wasted my time watching it when I could have done something way more interesting.  Maybe I just don't get it or can't empathize with the characters, I thought the little romance was cute and the grandma was cool, but overall I think I just found the main character to be really dumb.  sorry to all you guys who really liked it, maybe you're better than me too.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|From all the film reviews I'd expected something more intelligent than the retreaded humor about how Japanese roll their r's, their short stature (actually they're getting quite tall these days, must be eating more McBurgers), and cultural differences played for laughs. Murray's character is a snotty bore, angry and frustrated for being there, and dimissive of a culture that he never really tries to understand. The ugly American in a foreign land who is angry because the natives don't speak English correctly; the nerve! <br /> <br />I'd have more sympathy for Murray's character if he'd actually tried to reach out to anyone, got off his sorry duff and tried to reach out the Japanese for a change, use a few lines of broken Japanese perhaps, but he never does and that's the shame of this film. Coppola seems talented and the cinematography was beautiful, but this film still read like a spoiled, jaded rich girl's vision of Japan. It was all about the beautiful surface.
0385510454|1.0|Grisham has written some great books. But this one is very very boring. I am surprised at some of the positive reviews and said to myself .. it could not be true.

B000002NJS|4.0|One has the tendency to wax Madonna's extraordinary CD \\"Ray of Light\\" as her foray into electonica, but no one should limit its provocativeness into such a narrow hold. This collection does, indeed, encompass electronica's aesthetic, but it's a compendium of such raw emotion, mixed with melodies so fluid as to melt right into, that it takes the cold technicality of electronica and gives it life. While treading such ground in the past [Marvin Gaye's 'I Want You\\" cover, and the track \\"Bedtime Stories\\"], here she coheres full throttle, breathing new existence into drum and bass, rock and house and ambient and even an Asian mantra, while resurrecting a personal diary not seen since her masterpiece, \\"Like A Prayer\\" almost a decade before. Consider it the Mother of Re-Invention's 'Sgt. Pepper'.  My grade:  A-
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I think Clarissa Garcia's review was spot-on. <br />While everybody has a different sense of humor, I simply do not understand how this movie is considered \\"funny.\\" Most of the characters appear bored in their roles, reciting their apathetic lines in emotionless monotone. This can be funny if done well, but only when well-written. If just about any conversation in the movie were removed, it wouldn't significantly effect the (alleged) flow of the movie.  <br />An example of a conversation (paraphrased since I don't recall the exact lines--they weren't very memorable).: <br />Napoleon to Pedro: What will you do when you ask her out. <br />Pedro: I don't know, maybe make her a cake or something. <br />Napoleon: Oh, okay. <br /> <br />In general, the rest of the dialogue is similar--eventless and mostly pointless. Some movies are intentionally funny (American Pie and similar pure comedy movies), some are not meant to be funny but end up being so due to clever writers, and some try to be funny and fail miserably due to mindless stupidity (Big Mama's House, Undercover Brother). Napoleon Dynamite is none of those--it doesn't seem to try to be funny and doesn't succeed in being funny--it just exists <br /> <br />While nobody watches this kind of movie expecting a deep plot or insightful dialog, most people at least expect more than a string of unrelated events that have no tie-in due to the lack of some measure of plot, point, or reason for existance. This film seems to me little more than a documentary on a few weeks of the lives of a few boring people. I'd compare it to Blair Witch in some ways, mostly in the \\"waste of time\\" department. <br />I recommend renting or borrowing it before buying because it is definitely a \\"like it or hate it\\" movie.

B00006CXXU|1.0|When ya got nothing, steal from everyone.  And get naked.  That's the seeming credo from this latest toilet offering from the grimy wannabe diva.  It is not within my memory when I've witnessed such a wretched attempt at attention and identity apparently lost at birth.  A little J.Lo here, a little Britney there, a whole lotta Mariah everywhere, and violating Pink's makeover artist, Linda Perry - all juxtaposed in a cacophony of despair resulting in a slimy sonic & superficial makeover that makes dogs commit suicide.<br /><br />The intentional virgin/whore complex is an intriguing concept, but not if you don't have the musical balls to back it up with something resembling coherence.  But we do not.  Forget the video to \\"Dirrty\\", which is so D.O.A. that you wind up counting her pubic hairs than actually listening to the song...what we get is track after track of faux R&B, and the endless shrilling of a canon so confused with conflicting emotions and distorted language, our sympathy level only rises until we realize that not only does this hack need a flea bath, she needs a full time therapist. Upped a grade for 'Beautiful' - one could only fantasize how Pink could've/would've handled that.  My grade: D

0783225482|3.0|Although the theatrical aspect ratio of this movie was 1.85:1, while the DVD aspect ratio is 4:3, this is not a \\"Pan&Scan\\" DVD.  In other words, almost none of the original theatrical image has been removed for exhibition on a 4:3 television screen.  The film negative aspect ratio was 1.37:1 (almost 4:3), and for theatrical exhibition, the image was \\"matted\\" (partially covered from the top down and bottom up) to produce a 1.85:1 image.  For exhibition on a 4:3 television screen, the \\"mattes\\" have simply been removed.  So the DVD exhibition actually shows 27.9 percent more image than the theatrical exhibition.  The movie was likely filmed this way so that the theatrical image wouldn't be butchered on television by the \\"Pan&Scan\\" process, and because the filmmakers didn't foresee the current state of the home video market, where consumers prefer movies presented in their theatrical aspect ratio, rather than in a ratio in which the image will fill up their 4:3 television screen (if there is a difference).  This DVD presents the movie in the aspect ratio in which the filmmakers wanted people to see it on a 4:3 television, but it does not present the movie in the aspect ratio in which the filmmakers wanted people to see it in a movie theater (for that, the DVD would have to present the movie in a \\"matted widescreen\\" format).  If you're okay with that, enjoy!
B0006399FS|2.0|If you were to take a pair of oversized sunglasses, the Holy Bible/Koran/holy text of your choice, and a sack of potatoes and put them into a pot and cook the mix for 49 minutes, you'd end up with U2's latest effort, \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\".  The album is spearheaded by the head spinning \\"Vertigo\\" and backed up by the powerful \\"All Because of You\\".  After that, the album starts to lose some of its charm.  Allow me to explain. <br /> <br /> Did you notice the religious references I made early on?  If you plan to check out this album, get ready for a whole lot more of them.  U2 either found God or checked their almighty answering machine before heading into the studio for this one.  With lines like Your love is teaching me how to kneel, Lay down your guns / All your daughters of Zion / All you Abraham sons, and many more, the omni-present is ever-present in song.  It also seems to reflect on the absence of God with lyrical licenses such as I've been trying to feel complete again / But you're gone and so is God and Take this soul / And make it sing...Yahweh, Yahweh / Still I'm waiting for the dawn.   <br /> <br />  A personal favorite amidst the musing of the Messiah has to be \\"City of Blinding Lights\\".  A song full of hope, yet uninspired by Him, my favorite line in the whole album can be found in here.  Time...time / Won't leave me as I am / But time won't take the boy out of this man.  Although some of the surrounding lyrics do contain some holy hints, \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" has enough of an intersting guitar riff and excellent lyrics to be my official favorite song off the album.  Radio friendly?  Probably not, but that's the way it works sometimes. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I've ragged on the overly religious tonations of the album, there's something about \\"All Because of You\\".  It's strange for me to not be able to put my finger on the exact compelling aspects, but the tune is enjoyable nevertheless. <br /> <br /> The album ranks low purely on its subject matter.  If you're a religious person, I'm sorry.  I'm just one of those people that thinks that everything has its place, and religion in song belongs at mass/temple/place of worship of your choice or the Switchfoot album (yes, they are a Christian rock band).  Any other set of lyrics would score higher in my book, provided they kept the same guitar, bass and drum lines.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I have never been so captivated by the combination of guitar work and vocals as when I heard \\"Sultans of Swing\\" for the first time. It is truly among the greatest songs ever produced. Even with such a great song as \\"Sultans,\\" the other tracks on this album do not suffer. Upbeat, catchy songs like \\"Setting Me Up\\" and \\"Southbound Again\\" have great guitar hooks and strong basslines. Slower, bluesy songs like \\"In The Gallery\\" and \\"Six Blade Knife\\" display Mark Knopfler's range as a guitar player. \\"Down to the Waterline\\" and \\"Lions\\" are beyond classification as either rock or blues.     BEST SONGS: \\"Sultans of Swing,\\" \\"Southbound Again,\\" \\"Down to the Waterline\\"    SONGS TO SKIP: None    Overall, Dire Straits' first album is a classic compilation of laid-back, blues rock masterpieces that hold up better than most songs of a similar genre. This album is by far their best, and is a must have for anybody who appreciates electric guitar and a unique sound.
B00009RAJH|5.0|Here is a remastered version of Fleetwood Mac's 1975 s/t album. It features bonus tracks, which are mostly single edits of the full-length album versions.<br /><br />Fleetwood Mac (possibly taken from the names of two of it's founding members, drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie) started out as a psychedelic/blues band in the late-'60s. Things began to change for the band, as co-founding members Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer slowly began to lose ground to drug abuse and mental illness. Come some years later, Lindsey Buckingham was asked to join the band on guitar, but Lindsey said he would join the band only under the condition that they would accept Stevie Nicks in as well, since Lindsey and Stevie were a \\"duo\\" act (which never went anywhere) and something of a couple. With this, the new -- and more commercially successful -- Fleetwood Mac was born.<br /><br />Fleetwood Mac's self-titled 1975 release is loaded wih tracks exhibiting the somewhat slick, but tasteful, emotive pop rock that the Mac would eventually become famous with. Lindsey's tasteful, country-tinged guitar licks, Christine McVie's sensual, husky vocals, and Stevie Nicks' mystical, introspective leanings are all noticeable here. These three are the dominating songwriters and personalities of the band, but that's not to say that Mick Fleetwood and John McVie aren't worth mentioning: Fleetwood's drumming is simple for the most part, but just as tasteful and enjoyable, and McVie provides impressive and tasteful backing basslines, which are readily noticeable.<br /><br />\\"Monday Morning\\" is catchy, melodic and infectious, regardless of the slick production. Lindsey's vocals and guitar playing here are highly enjoyable. The vocal harmonies are great too. \\"Warm Ways\\" is a sensual, seductive, silky-smooth romantic ballad written and sung by keyboardist Christine McVie. Romantic souls (like myself) will eat this sweet thing up. \\"Blue Letter\\" is a short, fast-paced country-tinged rocker sung by Lindsey. Catchy, hummable verses give way to the infectious \\"I ain't waitin'\\" close-out. Next up is Stevie's \\"Rhiannon,\\" which became a hit for the band. Christine McVie dazzles and seduces again with \\"Over My Head,\\" a subtly wispy number with McVie's emotive lyrical and vocal delivery. In regards to the ladies of the band, I find Christine McVie's songs -- and vocals -- to be more seductive and enjoyable than Stevie Nicks' on the whole, if anyone reading this review hasn't figured that out by now. This isn't to shortchange Stevie Nicks' contributions at all, as I enjoy those too. Speaking of Stevie, she writes the next song \\"Crystal,\\" which is a slow-groover with an airy atmosphere.<br /><br />Next, it's Christine McVie again, with the charming, romantic, and hummable \\"Say You Love Me.\\" This one can be heard on radio stations, even today. Stevie Nicks' shining moment on this disc is \\"Landslide,\\" an introspective number featuring arpeggios from Lindsey Buckingham, which paint something of a somber, reflective atmosphere to match that of the song's nature. The Christine McVie/Buckingham-written \\"World Turning\\" bears a slight resemblance to disco, but not too much as to ruin your appetite (assuming the majority of reviewers/Mac fans who read this review are as put off by most disco as I am.) Christine McVie charms once again with \\"Sugar Daddy,\\" but this one isn't as charming as the other McVie numbers that appeared earlier on the disc. The closing track, \\"I'm So Afraid\\" (written and sung by Buckingham) is a minor-key, melancholic number with a haunting, semi-chilling atmosphere brought on by the minor chords that dominate the track. The lyrics are quite melancholic and pained as well. The solo near the end of the track can be described as devastating.<br /><br />Things would get a bit heavier in atmosphere next time around on 1977's _Rumours_, due to the drama surrounding the band, but this drama helped to inspire what would become Fleetwood Mac's biggest album. While things weren't too heavy during this release, the album still came out excellent. Make sure you pick up both for some tasteful, moving, sensuous (and sometimes fun) pop music.lbum.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is quirky, weird and slow and I absolutely loved it!  It is one of those movies that is still making me laugh months after seeing it.  But it is not for everyone.  If David Letterman annoys you, or you didn't get the Holy Grail, you'll hate it.  Vote for Pedro!
B00062ZE3U|5.0|Within Temptation is a talented band from Holland or Netherlands if you prefer who's lead singer is Sharon den Adel and she's as pretty as her voice is. There's a video of one of the songs on the album and she's a knockout. The music is symphonic metal with orchestral and choir backing. It is highly melodic and enchanting. If you know and like the band Nightwish then this is for you.<br /><br />Some of the best songs are \\"See Who I Am\\", which starts with a huge sound then smartly slows down only to come back with the big catchy chorus, \\"Jillian (I'd give my Heart)\\" is just great with it's gigantic intro followed by the choir and Sharon's impeccable voice on the choruses and Stand my Ground\\" is slick the way it starts out sedately then explodes into a \\"don't mess with me\\" warrior mentality with the orchestra and choir. \\"Angels\\" is kind of appropriate with a heavenly Angelic sound and what can you say about \\"Pale\\"? Has there ever been a prettier melody in a song?<br /><br />Taken as a whole there isn't much variety since each song does resemble the others but that homogenous sound doesn't bother me. In some ways it reminds me of a fine musical score where a change of style could be jolting.<br /><br />I am really amazed that there are people that gave this album less than four stars. From beginning to end it's a great album. Is it better than their previous blockbuster, Mother Earth? It's close, I'd say probably not but only by the slimest of margins.<br /><br />Similar Bands<br />Nightwish, Edenbridge, Visions of Atlantis, Dreams of Sanity, Enya, Loreena McKinnett
B0006SLDW0|5.0|Kamelot  <br />\\"The Black Halo\\" <br /> <br />Their bio says Kamelot is a band you can rely on. That could be taken to mean that the band stays with the same formulas time after time. With Kamelot you can rely on the fact that they will not copy old formulas and will challenge themselves plus the listener, time after time. Enter \\"The Black Halo\\"!  <br /> <br />The Black Halo is the continuation of the Epica saga, loosely based on German writer Wolfgang Goethe's Faust masterpiece. Much like Faust Part II, The Black Halo touches the darker side of the main character Ariel. The devil (Mephisto) is ever present in this modern day conceptual masterpiece. Masterpiece I said...  <br /> <br />The album starts off with what I imagine is a huge rally that Mephisto is leading to drum up the troops of the dark side. The voice of Mephisto is none other than Shagrath of the very popular black metal band Dimmu Borgir. His voice fits the atmosphere perfectly and I must say it was a stroke of genius to mix these two genres in the classy way that Kamelot has a knack for. This leads into the heart of \\"March of Mephisto\\", maybe Kamelot's heaviest but still very melodic song. I was expecting the usual double bass fast song that so many melodic bands do these days. March of Mephisto is a mid tempo power song that finally breaks the cookie cutter trend. (A great and refreshing move in my opinion) The keyboard solo features Jens Johansson of Stratovarius fame and ex-Malmsteen. He does a fantastic job as what seems like the devil stroking a violin from hell! <br /> <br />The second song \\"When the lights are Down\\" kicks in with a very fast double bass tune that is classic Kamelot mixed with some modern elements. The chorus is a winner that will stick in your brain immediately. There is an incredible solo tradeoff this time with guitarist Thomas Youngblood and Jens Johansson.  <br /> <br />\\"The Haunting\\" follows with a fresh and beautiful approach that in my ears could bring Kamelot a much larger audience. The song has all the Kamelot sound with a more concise and \\"commercial\\" approach. They manage to do this without sounding like anyone else. Mezzo Soprano vocalist Simone Simons from Holland is also on the track and brings and gorgeous element to the song. The band is shooting a video for this track which makes total sense to me since it will have some appeal to broader audiences.  <br /> <br />The title track \\"The Black Halo\\" is one of Kamelot trademark 5/4 songs that incorporates some progressive influences that Kamelot has a keen sense to use subtlety under their power/melodic metal skin. It follows an incredibly beautiful Italian piece that is sung by Cinzia Rizzo. Cinzia also appeared on Kamelot's Fourth Legacy album. <br /> <br />The 8 minute journey \\"Memento Mori\\" is Kamelot's longest and maybe most epic song to date. A mixture of many styles and speeds that will be a classic for the fans. It is the climax to the storyline of the three main characters in the saga. <br /> <br />These are only five of 14 tracks that have absolutely no fillers. It would take me hours to finish this review if I commented on every incredible song. I must leave the rest to you to discover, explore and ponder the lyrical meanings within this gem. This album is a must buy for all fans of any music! <br />My only criticism is that Kamelot didn't release this album earlier, but I understand the wait considering the amount of work that must have gone into writing and producing 2005's equivalent of Mindcrime!  <br />Production from Sascha Paeth and Miro is once again great and in my mind a little heavier than previous productions from the Wolfsburg duo. Something I missed on the Epica release.  <br />
0887307280|3.0|Maybe my view is tainted because I read fast food nation at the same time which had at its helm a number of businesses who adopted this systems process business model. <br /> <br />Most of the entrepreneurs I know who have actually started and sold on their businesses would suggest that a good business has a good balance of systems and people processes.  <br /> <br />One of the things that worry me about the book is that most entrepreneurs are great at attracting and motivating staff who can carry their vision and passion for the business. The over emphasis on systems takes away this real world business experience and in many ways destorys the soul of business present in many of the larger corporations. <br /> <br />That said he does have some very good points about the marketing and management of the business. One of the points I agree with him totally on is that not all people are cut out for business and thus apply this title of entrepreneur. Not a bad book, but could have been shorter. But then I dont like Jack welches style of management. Each to their own
B000002UAO|5.0|As a 24 year old who is a casual Beatles fan, my friends look at me like I'm crazy when I bring their music up.  But the Beatles deserve all the respect they get as they are truly legends and one of a kind.   <br /> <br />\\"Rubber Soul\\" is a brilliant pop rock record and displays music at it's best.  When it comes down to music it's really about your opinion, but here is a review from someone from the younger generation who had no exposure to the Beatles.  Nope, my folks were Stones fans. <br /> <br />1.  Drive My Car= Great opener for the record, very catchy and i love the opening guitar riff.  Could do without the \\"beep beep beep\\" vocals but what a tune (A-). <br /> <br />2.  Norwegian Wood= Was never a fan of Harrison's sitar but it doesn't overshadow the brilliant melody and lyrics of this classic (A-) <br /> <br />3.  You Won't See Me= Had never heard it until I picked up the CD.  It's become one of my favorites because it's so addictive.  Paul has always been my favorite Beatle, and he dominates the song, although the background vocals are a perfect touch to a perfect song.  (A+)   <br /> <br />4.  Nowhere Man= Put it like this, they could have taken Lennon's line \\"Nowhere Man, please listen...\\" and just by the way he sings that line, they could loop it over and over for the whole song, and it would still be great.  Perfect (A) <br /> <br />5.  Think for Yourself= Great song but it never really hit me much, lyrically and vocally.  It might have been graded lower if the music, especially the spectacular bass work, wasn't so strong (B). <br /> <br />6.  The Word= For me, one of the weaker songs on the record.  Doesn't do much to me, it's really too simple and although it's not a bad song, it doesn't stand shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the album (C). <br /> <br />7.  Michelle= My man Paul at it again.  Vocals, lyrics, music...all done to perfection.  Legendary hit and one the record's strongest highlights (A). <br /> <br />8.  What Goes On= Probably the weakest track in my opinion.  Don't like the country feel to it and I'd rather the drummer do just that.  Not much here (C-). <br /> <br />9.  Girl= Really Like this song.  Took awhile to grow on me but it has and if I re-wrote this review in six months, it might be one of my favorites.  Good work John (B+). <br /> <br />10.  I'm Looking through You= Another good tune, it's pretty good because it flows well and has some good guitar work (B-). <br /> <br />11.  In My Life=  Ladies and Gentleman, my favorite Beatles song of all time.  Perfect, perfect, perfect.  First heard this song when Bono of u2 covered it at a u2 concert I was at in 2001.  It made me go out and buy the record.  Beautiful guitar to begin the song and it just gets better and better.  Untouchable lyrics and vocals on this one (A+). <br /> <br />12. Wait= Along with track 8, probably the weakest of the record (C). <br /> <br />13.  If I Needed Someone= Brilliant performance by Lennon on this track, very solid (B-). <br /> <br />14.  Run for Your Lfe= Not the strongest, but I think it's just a fun tune that has a great chorus.  I Like it (C+). <br /> <br />It seems \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Revolver\\" sometime get most of the praise as the Beatles best album, but this one is right up there.  I love it and am trying to expand my collection as time goes on.  No matter what age you are, truly great music stays just that...great.
B000002UDB|5.0|The Magical Mystery is not loved by all Beatles fans, as some like to stick to their early 60s sound. However, this album best displays the brilliance of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, especially in terms of the lyrical quality of these tracks. This album was released in the time of psychedelia and it offers some interesting quirks to follow that style of music.<br /><br />Song by Song:<br /><br />1. Magical Mystery Tour: A very catchy, energetic tune that carries a lovely harmony. 9/10<br /><br />2. Fool on the hill: This track is brilliant. A slow, soothing track sung in a very mellow, dramatic tone by Paul. One of the Beatles best. 9.5/10<br /><br />3. Flying: A brilliant, instrumental track composed by the whole crew. It has a wonderful guitar intro which leads into delightful  trumpeting. A wonderful song. 9/10<br /><br />4. Blue Jay Way: Probably the weakest Beatles track on this album and it still carries a tune to it. 7.5/10<br /><br />5. Your Mother Should Know: A beautifully composed ballad. It is a little weak in the lyrical standpoint, but the catchy chorus drifts away from that flaw. 9/10<br /><br />6. I am the walrus: A truly remarkable track composed with sheer brilliance. A captivating intro leads into a bizarre, yet brilliant song. 10/10<br /><br />7. Hello Goodbye: A favourite for many Beatles fans, this simple and catchy track will have you singing along in no time. 9.5/10<br /><br />8. Strawberry Fields Forever: A powerful song and the psychedelia can be noted withing the track. A wonderful chorus featuring many quirky sounds. 9/10<br /><br />9. Penny Lane: A wonderfully catchy tune. Its hard to describe this one. Great. 9/10<br /><br />10. Baby You're a Rich Man: I don't really like this one. It's not for me. 6.5/10<br /><br />11. All you need is love: An immediate hit with a powerful meaning. It carries a lovely melody to it. Its the one song that can always cheer me up. 9.5/10<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the many fantastic Beatles albums that  belongs in any rock collection. It brilliantly exemplifies The Beatles outstanding song writing abilities.he many fantastic Beatles albums that   belongs in any rock collection.

B0006IIKS0|5.0|This is one of the most in depth and interesting documentaries I've ever seen. Its very entertaining to watch but also contains some very important themes and values that many people will identify with. This documentary should be the 101 course in how to maintain a good working relationship once the initial fire has dimmed. Metallica fans and non-metallca fans alike will take alot away from this movie.<br /><br />The DVD extras are also top notch providing hours and hours of bonus footage on DVD 2. You'll get everything from rare live performances, music videos and new 'in the studio' scenes in this bonus footage. Ever wanted to see the extended cut of the Dave Mustaine interview, the Swizz Beats recording session (ughh) or the first time Frantic was performed live? Its all here. Great purchase!<br /><br />By the way, any 1 star reviews are just the typical Metallica bashing fare. Nothing new, just ignore them and they'll go away.
0679428895|3.0|As a fan of historical fiction, this was good, educational and entertaining.  I wanted the story to go further, but it sort of just ended.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|For people like Roger Ebert who pan this movie... you just don't get it.<br /><br />I'm not claiming any intellectual superiority or great film taste... it's just that I get it.<br /><br />Perhaps because I see elements of Napoleon Dynamite in me.  For instance... his response on the bus \\"whatever I feel like.  Gosh!\\" When I was in 4th grade I moved from a northern town in Illinois (Geneseo) to a small town called Lousville (pronounced Lewis-ville) in very southern Illinois where the culture was very different and people had Alabama-like accents.  When I was riding on the schoolbus, my first day in mid-semester, I was petrified.  Everyone stared at me as they stopped at my delapidated trailer to pick me up.  A little girl turned around and asked \\"What's your naaaaame?\\" To which I replied \\"shuuuuuuuuuuuut uuuuuup!\\" And from that day on was greeted by everyone in unison shouting \\"HI SHUUUUUTUUUP\\" as I walked on the bus.  My reply was out of a vain effort at self-defense... not mean-ness.. and so was Napoleons.<br /><br />Napoleon's journey was a remarkable, willful transformation, as was that of Deb and Pedro.  Kip was amusingly transformed, but not so much with self-awareness.  Uncle Rico was the only static character, which made it all the more funny because he had not changed since 1982.<br /><br />Of all the lines, the one where Napleon told Deb to get her stuff  because there wasn't enough room for his nunchucks made me laugh the most hysterically.<br /><br />Almost all the humor, other than \\"the dance\\" was rooted in hilarious subtlety and satire.  I mean, how could I not be floored by someone bragging about chatting with hot babes online.... ALL DAY!<br /><br />The bizarre time-period (An elegant collage of the 70's, 80's, and 90's) gives this film a wide audience and uses silly things from all decades to make it more hilarious.<br /><br />My conclusion is that people who don't like this movie are either  1) TOO nerdy to realize they are only the one side of thenerdy characters  2) They ARE Summer Wheatley 3) People like Roger Ebert who are absolutely clueless about the level of subtle humor in this film.<br /><br />To the people comparing this to laughing at clowns... their reviews had me laughing as much as the movie... it's a total comedy in itself.  ND is not a clown, he's flippin Superman in moonboots with a fro!<br /><br />The ONLY other DVD I own is Monty Python's the Holy Grail... which also has incredibly intelligent subtle humor woven into the surface silliness.<br /><br />For the intellect and the funny bone, I give ND a 5/5 stars.  As far as those complaining about the \\"terrible\\" soundtrack, I wish I could give it 6/5 stars for having \\"Forever Young\\" by Alphaville and \\"The Promise\\" by When In Rome as too of the main songs in the soundtrack.<br /><br />This thing just gets funnier the more I watch it.<br /><br />P.S.  Dear Roger Ebert... please watch this film again, then watch the piece of junk that \\"Garfield\\" is, and look at yourself in the mirror and cry.
B00005JMXX|4.0|Dennis Quaid leads a large cast in this disaster thriller about extreme climate changes bringing about a new ice age. This movie delivers exactly what it promises to: a broad story, cool special effects and terrible dialog. Are there holes in the story? You bet, but it's still a fun movie to watch.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|All I have to say is...if you have not seen this show...how can you say things about it based on this CD??  To the person saying that the show is only for kids and not for adults, you have obviously not seen the show.  It is full of \\"adult themes\\".  Seeing how people freak about what children are watching nowadays...I'm not sure some of the subject matter would be for children.  Please stick to reviewing the performances and songs on the CD and stop bashing the show.  This CD leaves out alot of the show and it's message.  I saw it in January of 2004, and the CD is purely for the purpose of reliving moments from the show...not to take the place of it. Idina and Kristen are wonderful performers...Stephen Schwartz writes beautiful melodies (Defying Gravity and For Good)...Just leave it at that!!
B0000029AP|5.0|In the Aerosmith catalog this album is second only to the masterpiece that is Rocks. Toys in the Attic contains the classic Sweet Emotion and Walk This Way but there isn't a bad song. Some of the more obscure songs that didn't get radio play are favorites of mine like No More No More, You See Me Crying and Round and Round. Combined with Rocks which was released a year after Toys, you have a band at its creative peak.
B0006B2A42|5.0|cold-war saga, starring Rock Hudson, Patrick MacGoohan, Ernest Borgnine & Jim Brown. The suspense begins when Hudson as the captain of a US nuclear submarine is given a mission to a north pole research station manned by British and American scientists... <br />As a side note, one wonders if this was the reason that the 'Drake' character from Secret Agent finally resigned from being a spy and ended up being taken to 'The Village' as The Prisoner?
B0002IRXT6|5.0|este cd esta muy suave esta mejor que el que trae un dvd gran cantante alicia keys
B00008NG5V|4.0|This album isn't the masterpiece that Jack's first was, but its still worth owning. His lyrics are smooth and his rhythm guitar is as good as ever. This one might even sound better on first listen, but Brushfire Fairytales is still my fav.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|While I adore this movie and its stylish 1939 look and feel, I can't help being profoundly angry that the DVD forces you to watch no less than four previews for other movies before you're allowed to get to the menu to start the film. It disables the \\"menu\\" button so you can't skip past them. I paid for the DVD, why should I be forced to watch advertising every time I want to see the movie?
B000099T2L|5.0|I think that this is still the best cd although it's old. this cd has shown a lot of beyonces talent with singing nad her whole stage presence. I really believe that she will continue to be successful. One song that i can really relate to is the song that she made for her father. we share some of the same things, and although this is my step-father, this song reallyy expresses him to the \\"t\\". I have said that this song will be played at my wedding reception when i dance with my step-father. still, this cd has brought many accomplishments her way, and i hope for many more. i think she could remain a single artist from here on out. also this is a cd that you can listen to from 1-15, and can start your day off right. she is the most successful one yet out of the group of destiny's child. this albulm goes a long way in my book. thanks beyonce, good luck in all your future endeavors!!!!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|If the jokes and sight gags came just a bit more rapid paced you'd swear this film would have been made by the Zucker Brothers.  As Airplane skewered Aircraft disaster films and Naked Gun skewered cop dramas, Shaun of the dead is a rousing parody, and yet glorious tribute to zombie films, particularly those of George Romero.<br /><br />This is one of those films that requires 100% attention as there are just as many things going on in the backgound as there are in the foreground and if you don't pay attention, you'll miss some of the very ingenious tips of the hat that director Edgar Wright gives to those movies that he pays tribute to.  Listen to those radio and TV broadcasts playing in the background, keep your eyes on what those zombies are doing way down the street...it's all clever stuff.  I particularly love the radio report blaming an American Spacecrafts return descent as a possible explanation of the zombie phenomena.<br /><br />Shaun takes it's cue mainly from DAwn of the Dead.  Shaun is played by Simon Pegg.  He's a 29 year old electronics store loser.  He's just lost his girlfriend Liz, he's regretting a trip the following day to his mother's house and dealing with his stepfather.  He shares a flat with Ed, a lazy, overweight, crude couch potato whose even a bigger loser than Shaun.  While out to get some goods from the convenience store, Shaun is completely oblivious to the dead bodies and shambling zombies in his neighborhood.  Quite a wonderful skewering of middle America...err...England, just as Romero did in Dawn.<br /><br />Soon Shaun and Ed encounter the first zombies in their back yard and eventually discover you can take them out in similar Romero fashion by destroying the brain.  Thus the pair begins a plan of rescuing Shauns 'mum', his ex Liz, and her friends Dianne and David and taking refuge not in a mall, but in hilarious English style, the local pub!  Along the way the little group of survivors dodges zombies through suburban back yards, arguing amongst themselve and even encounters another group of survivors who match them almost identically as if from Bizarro world.<br /><br />Shaun of the Dead is the best Zombie movie in many years.  Better than both \\"28 Days Later\\" and the \\"Dawn\\" remake because of its style, and also because it follows the number one rule of Zombies: Zombies are SLOW and shambling.  They are not sprinters!  Shaun's amusing digs of these two films will certainly not be lost on anyone who's seen them.  Kudos again for Mr. Wright for calling them out.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, it's that the last 3rd of the film is played mostly as a straight zombie horror film and the comedy takes a bit of a back seat.  But the ending does save it as Director right gives one last bow to George Romero by tipping his hat to \\"Day of the Dead\\"<br /><br />The great DVD is loaded with extras including commentary and deleted scenes.  I cannot recommend this one any higher!yards, arguing amongst themselve and even encounters another group of survivors who match them almost identically as if from Bizarro world. <br /> <br />Shaun of the Dead is the best Zombie movie in many years.

B00030590I|5.0|A movie of this complexity really cannot be described without the reviewer sounding like they think they are the next world famous movie critic.  Plus, a movie of this calibur is tough to review without becoming too verbose.  That being said, I do not fashion myself a movie critic by any means, and I will try to keep my review concise.    Summary? This movie is nothing less than a masterpiece.    I stumbled upon this movie quite accidentially.  However, I am certainly glad I did.  It is a simple story which is masterfully and flawlessly told.  It unfolds before you like a carefully crafted series of chess moves, is very entertaining and engaging, and has a few twists along the way.      A point that must be made is that this is not a \\"kung-fu\\" movie.  It has action scenes that will please any martial arts fan, but this movie is so much more.    Although I preferred the musical score of Crouching Tiger to Hero (it seemed as if Hero's music was heavily influenced by Crouching Tiger), the score is very enjoyable and perfectly suited to the movie.    What can I say about the other major components?  Set design and shooting locations were almost flawless and in most cases absolutely stunning.  It struck me that maybe Crouching Tiger's (ok, so I'm a big fan) outdoor lighting (effective use of time of day) may have been more dramatic than Hero, but Hero is still far and away better than virtually any other movie you are likely to have seen.    One of the main things this movie does more than any other movie I can recall was the effective use of color in costume and sets.  Whoever thought of this and chose the actual color pallet (sp?) is no less than brilliant.  It really is a visually beautiful movie.    This is one of the best movies I've ever seen at any and all levels.  It's really not surprising that it's not a Hollywood original.  I don't think they make them like this anymore.    Is this Communist propaganda like some have summized?  I believe you need to view thisfilm in it's historical perspective.  Come on people!  What was the set of ideals driving this part of the world during the era of the film?  I believe it was one of self-sacrific and honor to the greater good.  You don't necessarily have to agree with these principles to enjoy this movie!  As a matter of fact, there are a couple of scenes (won't reveal them here) that on a personal level I certainly objected to.  However, the characters actions were much like I would assume given their philosophies displayed.    Conclusion?  You won't know what you're missing until you watch it.  After you watch it, you will be forever glad you did.
1400043662|4.0|The title alone, KAFKA ON THE SHORE, signals that what's inside is out of the ordinary, and it most certainly is. Haruki Murakami has filled this 436-page novel with a mysterious object in the sky, talking cats and an alter-ego black crow, an old man who sleeps for forty hours at a stretch, a hemophiliac hermaphrodite librarian, \\"concepts\\" who appear in the form of Johnny Walker and Colonel Sanders, ghosts, leeches raining from the sky, a giant slug that inhabits human bodies, and a magical stone portal to an earthly Limbo deep in the forest. Toss in some Beethoven and Haydn, Adolph Eichmann, Napoleon's invasion of Russia, Oedipus Rex, the Trojan princess Cassandra, The Tale of Genji, the Arabian Nights, and American jazz and rock music, and the result is a cultural rollercoaster ride through a sort of secular, pop mysticism.  <br /> <br />The story line alternates between two distinct threads. The odd-numbered chapters trace the coming of age escapades of Kafka Tamura, a fifteen-year-old high school dropout and runaway. Kafka is preternaturally mature and unusually self-disciplined for a dropout, but his childhood has been marked by the sudden departure of his mother and sister and the upbringing of a cold and distant father. He encounters a series of sexual adventures on his sojourns, complicated by a bizarre connection to his father's stabbing death and his apparent completion of the Oedipal triangle by sleeping with an older woman who might be his mother.  <br /> <br />The second story line involves Satoru Nakata, an aging man-child who collapsed as a youth into a sudden sleep along with fifteen of his classmates while they were in the forest on a mushroom-picking excursion. Unlike the other children who woke up shortly after, Nakata remained in a coma for several weeks. When he finally awoke, he could no longer read or write and had lost his memory. However, he had a newfound ability to speak with cats. We follow Nakata on a grail quest that even he cannot understand, aided by a truck driver named Hoshino whose life is changed by his experiences with the old man he calls \\"Gramps.\\"  <br /> <br />Ultimately, Nakata's and Kafka's stories merge in Shikoku, a small Japanese island, where Kafka has been simultaneously hiding from his father and from the police. Nakata unknowingly opens a door that enables Kafka to confront the truth about himself and his feelings toward his mother, a truth that allows the boy to proceed with life on his own terms, to sit at the metaphorical shore and contemplate both his past and his future.  <br /> <br />Fans of Murakami will likely enjoy KAFKA ON THE SHORE for its offbeat brazenness and its kinky ride through modern culture, while those new to the author may find this book uncomfortably strange. Either way, Murakami's is a unique voice in modern literature, full of humor and intriguing speculations, offering a fascinating perspectives on the meaning of life and how we each find our own way to live it.  <br /> <br />KAFKA ON THE SHORE is a literary three-ring circus, but as everyone knows, the circus is always fun. And it's also a magical place we sometimes dream of running away to join, a place where we, like Kafka Tamura, can escape the burdens of real life.  <br /> <br />
B000092Q8M|2.0|The US album is awesome but I was very disappointed in this SACD version mixed in Stereo only. Having already purchased the Remastered version there is nothing with this edition to consider it an upgrade. I had already decided to avoid stereo only SACD but I didn't study the packaging before I grabbed \\"US\\" along with \\"Shaking The Tree\\". My SACD player creats a \\"virtual\\" surround mix from the standard stereo edition which sounds much better then this Mutilchannel stereo mix. <br />Pick up the \\"Play\\" DVD for the 5.1 Surround mixes and turn the picture off. ( or not )
B0006IIPIK|4.0|4.5/5 - This film was well crafted on all accounts.  Conran did a superb job in creating a fantastic vision of New York and the comic book world.  Everything in the movie reeks of comics, heroes, the fight for justice and so on.  Even Sky Captain takes on the role of standard hero when he says such lines as, \\"I'm going to make Tontenkopf pay for what he's done.\\"  A rip roaring, perfectly assembled score to play up the hero in Sky Captain is much fun to listen to.   <br /> <br />I rather not dwell too much on the positives, as there are many here who have posted on that already...one of the faults of the movie lies in the character of Sky Captain himself.  He is not the dynamic hero that Indiana Jones is, or even a hero that has much character to him.  He is solid, but not much more.  He says the hero lines, but even his chemistry with Polly is bland.  She is drooling over him with her eyes in scenes, but we get nothing from him.  Only when he comes foward with a past affair after lying about it, does he seem to have a unique personality, but it is a little late in the film.  I wish Sky Captain had been a little bit more creative in his dialogue and style.  In the comics, one had to create a unique hero so the fans would be interested in following the hero's journey each 'episode.'  So while, Sky Captain comes off as bland and heroic, one could have asked for a bit more personality in their hero.   <br /> <br />Overall, this film is enjoyable.  One should view this movie if only for the artistic vision alone (one exception is Polly running from the robots - looked ridiculously fake that one wonders if it was done with the intention of recreating a King Kong-esque(1930s) low brow special effects tribute there.)   <br /> <br />So, grab the popcorn and prepare for the adventures of Sky Captain. <br />
B00008EY65|5.0|This is a really great movie, because it takes so many things from various HELLBOY stories(and not just of Seed of Destruction) and captures the look and feel of the comics. Thoroughly recommended for any fan of a good action movie, superheroe movie, and specially for any HELLBOY or Mike Mignola fan. The best comic inspired movie yet (I even liked it better than Spider-Man 2 and X2, even though I was a fan of those properties YEARS before I was a fan of Hellboy). A trully great film and a must buy DVD (tons of extras). A++
0375703764|5.0|Mark Z. Danielewski's novel (if you wish to label it so) is a work of utter genius. His account is steeped in academia, horror and gritty street life, with each feature perfectly realized. Nothing falls by the wayside in this book, and it is never difficult to keep up with the dual narrative. Many of Danielewski's conventions are as old as literature itself (colored text, interesting placement on the page, the false manuscript) but they have never been used as effectively before now. The claustrophobia that danielewski induces in his writing is matched with the increasingly shrinking text on the page. <br />In the beginning of this book his street-kid-cum-editor, Johnny Truant warns that \\"This book is not for you.\\" <br />One suspects that Truant airs his warning not becuase this book has ruined his life, more becuase it is his personal find, a thing of beauty unseen by the masses. And, like some guy who listened to Radiohead long before they were lauded as the best band ever, he is reluctant to share his secret love with the rest of the world.
B00005JMYI|5.0|I loved this movie. I have seen the movie many times as well as own it.  If you like the movie Dodgeball or Old School then this movie is right up your ally.  I quote the movie often with my friends.  There never seems to be a situation that can not be related to the movie.  This movie also has many hilarious scenes in it.  Will Farrell does a great job in his part of acting as Ron Burgundy.  I've been watching this movie for some time now and in no way is that depressing.  Anchorman is a must see movie and I strongly suggest that you go out and see the movie.
B00008NRI8|5.0|I love this movie.  It has great chemistry between Sandra and Hugh.  The script is witty, with talented actors (especially Hugh) to make it believable.  I laughed through the entire movie.  I highly recommend this movie if you have never seen it.  It's refreshing and fun.
B0000035E7|4.0|4.5 stars, to be exact.  The counter doesn't allow decimals, but it would be a sin punishable by the Hammurabai penal code to give this a score less than a 4.5. <br />This is possibly one of my favourite Nirvana CDs, it's also their first album, produced by Sub-Pop.  I enjoy this CD because it embodies the darker side of Nirvana: the highly cynical, mutually indifferent aspects.  Although the lyrics are somewhat difficult to comprehend, it's not difficult to relate to the raw energy that the three-piece rock group radiates.  If you are an artist, I guarantee you'll like this CD. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006M4SO6|5.0|This is the best ever Metheny-PMG compilation from a standpoint of pure composition and integrity from start to finish.  Having listened to at least 20 times i can say it just gets better and better.  May i dare say it vies for the best jazz masterpiece ever produced by anyone !!  Bravo, Pat and PMG!

B0000062S0|4.0|The subjectivity of music appreciation makes it almost impossible for a review to be influential on me, but after reading some reviews for this album I feel I have to comment on this.  This album was not and can not be viewed as a Zeppelin reunion, it must be viewed as a re-joining of two brilliant musicians.  Everybody has reviewed this album comparing it to Led Zeppelin, when these two artists where in there prime.  To truely grasps this album, listeners have to displace Led Zeppelin and think of Page/Plant as artists rather then 1/2 of the greatest rock band. <br />   This album has some really great tunes, \\"Most High\\", \\"When the World was Young\\", and \\"Upon a Golden Horse.\\" Are real stand outs musically, with \\"Most High\\" fusing heavy Morroaccan beats with vintage rock.  \\"When the World was Young\\" harkens back to the days of blues infused rock, and \\"Upon a Golden Horse\\" is just an all out rocker. <br />  Plant shows a lot of wear in his voice, but again it has to be taken for what it is.  He sings strongly in the middle ranges but his voice weakens when he attempts the high notes.  Page plays strongly on this album.  He seems to focus more on the riffs then any real standout solo. <br />  All in all this album is great, musically diverse, and a good showing from these artists.
0786915749|5.0|This book was THE best fantasy I have ever read! It was just so intrieging. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it right from the moment I read 1 page in the book store. Very nice adjectives too.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|Where did this come from?  Man...  I've been deprived since the release of this album.  I just got it a couple weeks ago, and I feel like I am in high school again, listening to bands that actually know how to convey EMOTION (unlike 99% of modern music today).  Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam, Live...  Muse could've been popular right alongside them.  I'm not saying they sound like them, they are just along the same vein (90's alternative).  I didn't think people made music like this anymore!!!  Even the slow songs have emotional payoffs at the choruses and bridges (an artform I thought was lost along with the feeling associated with 90's alternative).  Do they sound a bit like early Radiohead?  Sure...  are they better than early Radiohead?  (Don't shoot me) YES!  I never liked Radiohead much...  Muse has all of the emotion that Radiohead was missing (for me anyway).  And they aren't a blatant rip-off.  I think the main reason people are saying that is Matthew's voice.  Well, get over it, because this album kicks ass.
B00005QXDD|5.0|No band is like them.  they are a one of a kind superband.  their lyrics, pure guenius.  if you have a brain stem and can hear i suggest that you buy this now.  nothing will ever come close to this, this is pure magic.  as AC/DC would say it,\\"for those about to rock, we solute you\\"
068987474X|5.0|Why i love this book...because it is brutally honest. Now I can understand thebacklash with negative responses, I understand that women who have either been left with children or tired of women whining are annoyed with the seemingly trite \\"He's just not that into you.\\" HOWEVER, the truth is: men biologically are the pursuers for the most part. I found this out the very very tortuorous way, about 18 solid years of pursuing men, some responding, but eventually, even with dating some,  the relationship dwindling to an agonizing decay! I watched \\"Sex and The City\\" and loved its liberating tone. I think the authors are right on the money with this book as well. This book will save women a lot of heart ache. It does not mean women have to give up their choices, or feel that their sense of empowerment in relationships with men must be forfeited. However, if you pursue a man, if you try and rationalize the milion and one reasons why the man of your affections is not pursuing you, you are in serious denial. The end result in dating does not have to be marriage. Absolutely not. However, why set yourself up even in the daying arena by existing in a state of denial, by wasting precious days, weeks, years wondering why some guy has not called, written, proposed, or sent those twelve dozen roses on your birthday? He is just not that into you!!! Oh if only I had this book ten years ago when I tried to analyze every bit of conversation, every bit of evidence that perhaps suggested that the man I so pined for was just having a tough time, was commitophobic, had been abused as a child, was busy at work so he couldn't call...blah blah blah ad infinitum. I spent trillions of dollars in therapy, billions of dollars consulting psychic mediums, millions of dollars on Kleenex sobbing when no messages had been left when I got home. And my friends meant well, they cheered me on...not to give up, that \\"he would come around!\\" oh please! I was pathetic. Ladies, this book requires no adherence to rules of engagement, nor does it blow sunshine where the sun doesn;t shine. It quite simply states the truth. Some people cannot handle the truth, so they create imaginary scenerios with imaginary men and remain stuck and miserable. Respect yourself, you are worth it! Read this book, it is well worth the money.
B000002JSN|5.0|no band has, and never ever will reach the point of zeppelin.  zeppelin has changed the world as it is.  the gods of rock aka Led Zeppelin will change your life, like it has changed mine.  i used to listen to rap.  i was retarted, then my friend gave me this cd, it changed my whole outlook on life.  Zeppelin if you don't like it, go kill yourself.
B000008GEF|3.0|i revisted this record recently--i had it on eight track at prep school and wore it out, as i recall.  it doesn't really hold up, sadly enough.  sorta like \\"all things must pass\\" (the only george record you REALLY need to own) mach 2, three years on.  the arrangements are kinda desultory, the melodies maudlin.  the sweet lord is really f-ed up on Krishna.  \\"don't let me wait too long\\" is a great poppy piece, but--however unfair it is to hold a writer to his own very hightest standards--it's no \\"here comes the sun.\\"  i wanted to love this again.  couldn't.  but i like it  as there are some pleasant songs surely.  find it on vinyl--used. egads i almost bought \\"dark horse\\" (for the cover and the title track).  good thing i stayed my hand.
B000069KGM|5.0|Chicago use to be cool and what exactly happened to the band after this disc is anybodys guess.....I suspect they ended up drowning in a vat of syrup listening to Debbie Boone records....but we still have this heavy record to remind us of what once was......
B000002LE6|5.0|This album is right up there among his best.  Its biggest flaw, though, is technical; the CD is one single track.  Otherwise it's a great album if you are a Prince fan.  If you have skipped it in the past because of the cover, boy, you really are missing on some good music.  For the casual fan, the rating is probably 3 stars.  The best songs are Dance On and I Wish U Heaven.  Positivity is somewhat dull and Eye No is average.  Everything else is superb, including the Top 40 single Alphabet St.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Sure they sound a bit like Joy Division but who cares...they could've sounded like The Pet Shop Boys.....this is good stuff in a world dominated with 4th generation Pearl Jam and American Idol. It's about time that somebody updated the Joy Division sound anyhow.
B0000648WZ|1.0|This film is a classic Hollywood-adaptation abomination from start to finish. Not one shred of Heinlein's message is left unsmeared or  uncorrupted: substituting Nazi-esque Fascism for warrior honor and defense of humanity, wimpy Star Wars-infantry helmets for high-tech full battle armor, sleazy sex scenes and cheap shots for ... well, I don't recall any in the book.<br /><br />There is surely an eighth circle of hell reserved for directors like Verhoeven, who harks from the Netherlands, noted for its Leftist sociopolitics. Ah, but see where it got them; just ask Theo Van Gogh.<br /><br />Forget it and read the original novel. It should never have been touched by Hollywierd.
B000000OQF|5.0|Finally a band comes along and kicks the you know what out of all those lousy hair bands.  Sure Axl wore spandex and hairspray(at least in the beginning)but Slash looked like a madman and played guitar like one as well.  Just do the wise thing and get rid of your Poison,Ciderella and Great White CDs and load up on GnR,Metallica and Iron Maiden.....
B00000IIXH|3.0|If you're a Bruce fan you're buying this for three songs: \\"The Fever,\\" \\"The Promise,\\" \\"Trouble River.\\" They're good tunes, but Southside does a better \\"Fever,\\" and the other two are fine, but the bottom line is this is not even a very good sampler of TRACKS, as there are much better songs on the box set. (\\"Roulette\\" anyone?)Casual fans stay away; I wouldn't buy it until it hit the discount bin.
B000002I55|5.0|It's amazing how many poeple despise free jazz with no understanding of the music whatsoever.  My advice to them, stick with your Kenny G.
B00005J73X|5.0|It's funny that I wasn't into this band when everyone else was, but now I can't listen to or watch them enough! I guess I like their sound better now; the music is more than beating drums and screaming fans! I love how the fans actually sing a long now; that has got to make Jon and the guys feel so proud! Jon hung in there a long time, and now I think he's hotter than ever (and I don't mean only the music)!! Like a fine wine gets better with age.. that's you, Jon! The shorter hair and gorgeous smile melts me... but that's not why I gave this CD 5 stars, I did because it deserves 5 stars in my book. Great job! There is not one song that I don't like on this CD; it's a great mixture of their work. [I have a question for everyone else out there... I've been trying to purchase \\"VH1 presents Bon Jovi: One Last Wild Night\\" that aired 10/6/02 - 90 minute concert. Of course I started with VH1, but as I went through all their channels, I came to a dead end. Apparently, either it won't ever be for sale on DVD or I haven't found it yet. If anyone knows where I can purchase this DVD (or VHS), [...]
B0001Z363W|5.0|I HAD to write this review after seeing Brad's comments that this was the only disappointing album Zak had made.  I have only recently become aware of BLS (from Boneyard Satellite Radio), and this CD is GREAT!  3 Bona Fide metal hits, plus another 4-6 that are just good listening.  Remember the title - this is hangover music, so ALL headbanging wouldn't fit this CD.  Best BLS CD I have heard to date!
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|okay, for all you children who love DADA and GANG OF FOUR hooks all in one neat little package, here's another bruiser. NOW FOR THE REST OF US WHO UNDERSTAND GOOD MUSIC AND COULD AGREE, HERE\\"S A SHORT LIST OF MUSICAL COMPARISONS THAT NEED TO STOP: <br />joy division (oo'hh a big one), the cure, duran duran,PIL, and so on. PLEASE, let these bands have their legacy, and stop using them as a crunch. Franz Firepantz is totally pissing in the well in which they drink from.
B00006LJ72|2.0|This is an \\"Enhanced\\" CD - WATCH OUT! <br />These do not play on: <br />a. Older CD players <br />b. Computers <br />Why? Because the publisher has blessed us with all sorts of Software that automatically loads itself on to your computer. One reviewer noted only 3 hours of music on a 4 disk set.  <br />Why? Because they loaded Quicktime, screensavers and even a short cutsy \\"movie\\" of Enya.  <br />Because the CD is a few years old, it trys to load an older version of Quick time on your computer. While free updates are available, watch out. Unless you are a MacIntosh user, Quicktime is definately NOT good software. It wants to take over your Computer's media associations, etc.  <br />Also, these CD's will not play on some older CD players due to the presence of software. <br />Do yoursellf a favor - Skip this Set. There are other sets available for less.  <br />Also, never buy \\"enhanced\\" CD's as they contain extra junk.  <br />
1881273156|4.0|I noticed many people snactched up the book: He's Not that Into You, yet it caused problems for many who had been happily married because they measured 'love' by the amount of emotional attention their mate demonstrated (per the book)...when it is good to know some people have a different love style...some use primarily words and you can't get them to take out the trash...yet others always do things for their mates--yet they seldom say 'I love You'...if you read this book along with the others...a person will get a pretty balanced view of their partner's level of love for them (or lack therof)...but most importantly, it helps assess love 'style'...will save a lot of misunderstandings. This is probably a good gift for young newlyweds...and old ones too (smile)
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I think this movie is fun to watch. i mean it was surely refreshing to see mr. Dynamite and his brother and his uncle and his grandma> I can totally reccomend this movie there should be more movies like this one.  <br />so not to be mean but if you don't like this maybe your just and Idiot Gosh.
0385510454|5.0|The Broker, a great novel that I have really enjoyed reading I am a person who does not really like to read at all. The only things I would read were computer related stuff and short horror stories, because I could get in and out vary fast. I am on a businesses trip and decided to get a book to help pass the time. I found the Broker read the inside cover and thought it sounded good, well after 4 or 5 days now of having the book I have finished it. Now just to let you know I have not read a novel in over ten years and now I am vary happy to say that this will change now. If you get the chance read this book take it. Thank you for the time and enjoy. Pete
B0000AM6IY|5.0|The dancing in this movie take my breath away. This is a fantastic movie and deserves all the praise it recieves. This dvd is a well packaged DVD, but the downside is no extra features. If you want more extra features than you should buy the special edition but this one IS still great.
B000065Q5V|4.0|First half of ten I rate are high then it slips by the end.  This is worth getting before the indie touch gets killed on their disgustipated next album (self-loathe) Long Road.  The State would be a good place to start then this is a keeper.  The songs don't sound as forced and I think How You Remind Me has a hook that they should've taken to heart but that (I hope) is what they're looking for and working on for their next album sans Ryan &quot;Nik&quot; Vikedal.  His drumming was at its peak with this gem.  Good luck with their latest drummer and good luck with your next well-produced album, Chad Kroeger.  I'm praying for the newest Theory of a Deadman album, Gasoline.  No Surpise sounds refreshing than their last creation ever was.  Keep working harder, too, Default!!!!!  Keep rocking Nickelback!!!!!  Long live Albertans!!!!!
B000059QYB|4.0|When I listened to Billy Idol's music, the immediate word that came to my mind was intensity. I know when I put a Billy Idol album on, I would be prepared for a hard-rocking intense experience.   This has been a trademark behind Billy's music career.     I found \\"Billy Idol - Greatest Hits\\" a great place that captured Billy's greatest hits on one single CD.   For the most part, this CD is the way a Greatest Hits Collection should be constructed.   If it weren't for a few minor quirks, this collection would be near perfect. <br /> <br />\\"Billy Idol - Greatest Hits\\" takes the bulk of its music from between 1983 and 1993.  There are 16 tracks and 14 of the tracks come from the albums released in this period.   This includes 5 studio albums, 1 EP, and one Live Album.   In order the releases are: \\"Don't Stop\\" (EP from 1981), \\"Billy Idol\\" (1982), \\"Rebel Yell\\" (1984), \\"Whiplash Smile\\" (1986), \\"Vital Idol\\" (Live Album from 1987), \\"Charmed Life\\" (1990), and \\"Cyberpunk\\" (1993).  On \\"Billy Idol - Greatest Hits\\", for the most part each album is represented pretty well.   There are no singles included from \\"Vital Idol\\".   \\"Cyberpunk\\", which is generally considered one of Billy's weaker albums has only one song.  At the same time, \\"Rebel Yell\\", which is generally considered one of Billy's strongest albums leads the pack with four songs.   The collection also features two new songs:  There is a 1993 live version of \\"Rebel Yell\\" that is done with an acoustic slant.  There also is a 2001 remake of Simple Minds' \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\". <br /> <br />With Greatest Hits collections, I find that the best \\"Greatest Hits\\" collections are ones that arrange the songs in chronological order. This allows me to see how an artist progresses over time.  The nice thing about \\"Billy Idol - Greatest Hits\\" is that it does do this.   It might seem like \\"Mony Mony\\" is out of chronological order.  This is because it is the second song on the collection, but it did go number one in 1987.   \\"Mony Mony\\" was actually included on the \\"Don't Stop\\" EP and was never released as a single.  In 1987, a live version of \\"Mony Mony\\" went Number One from the \\"Vital Idol\\" album, but it actually was the \\"Don't Stop\\" EP version that got most of the airplay.  I never was a big fan of \\"Mony Mony\\", but to me - the live version is far superior to the studio version.   They should have included the live version on this collection - this would have given \\"Vital Idol\\" some representation and it would have included the better version of the song. <br /> <br />Historically, Billy Idol has done covers of many songs.  This provided Billy a way to pay homage to the artists that he grew up listening to.  Billy's popular covers are all included on this collection.  This includes the remake of Tommy James' \\"Mony Mony\\", the terrific 1986 remake of William Bell's \\"To Be a Lover\\", the 1990 cover of The Doors' \\"L.A. Woman\\", and the 2001 remake of Simple Minds' \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\".  If you listen to Billy's covers - most of the covers sound very different than the original version - especially 1986's \\"To Be a Lover\\".  I didn't think Billy's cover of \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\" was very good.   This cover goes back to Billy's connection with Keith Forsey.   Forsey happened to be the co-writer of that song and also did producing for Simple Minds.  I felt this song just wasn't very well suited to Billy's style.  There are some good guitar rifts by Billy and Steve Stevens, but that is about the extent of it.   I also think this version lacks a lot of the trademark intensity that has become a staple of Billy's career. <br /> <br />The other \\"new\\" song is the live version of Billy's \\"Rebel Yell\\" song.  This song is listed as \\"Live and Acoustic\\".   This is about as acoustic as it is going to get for Billy Idol.    In other words, don't expect an \\"Billy Idol Unplugged\\" - you still are going to hear a touch of electric guitar included on this song.   I actually enjoyed what Billy did with this version of the song. <br /> <br />It is also worth noting that \\"Dancing With Myself\\" is included.  This technically is a song from Billy's days when he was a member of the punk band, \\"Generation X\\".  However this song was also released on the \\"Don't Stop\\" EP, so it is included on this collection. <br /> <br />Another quirk is that there are single edits of two songs - \\"Don't Need a Gun\\" and \\"L.A. Woman\\".   Single edits are usually done for the purposes of putting the song on the radio.   This is something I am very much opposed to.  If I want to hear an edited version of the song, I'll listen to the radio.  For me, I always prefer to have the full version of the song.   While I do realize that there is 72+ minutes of music on \\"Billy Idol - Greatest Hits\\", I would have easily sacrificed one of the 2 new songs to hear the full versions of these songs.  In particular, \\"Don't Need a Gun\\" is one of Billy's best songs and they chop nearly a minute off in the radio edit. <br /> <br />One thing that I do like about this Greatest Hits collection is the liner notes.   Ben Edmunds writes up a terrific 3 page piece that basically covers Billy's career from his beginnings in Generation X through his motorcycle crash and beyond.  Each of the songs is listed - along with the album it was released on, the songwriting credits, its debut date, and where it ultimately wound up on the Billboard chart.  If it weren't for the the quirks (namely the radio edits and the omission of the live version of \\"Mony Mony\\"), this would have been given 5 stars.  However, it's still a great place to get a cross-section of Billy's work.
B000003N7Y|5.0|This is the place to learn all you need to know, if all you need to know is whether or not to become a Mingus fan. This is the album that hooked me, and I still consider it his best. The compisitions are old, but these revamped versions are definatley the ones to own. With renewed vitality, Mingus turns his standards into a new revelation! <br /> <br />Once you're hooked you'll find a wealth of great albums waiting for you, but this is the place to start, it almost seems made to order for an introduction to his genius. <br /> <br />And for anyone interested \\"2BS\\", a reworked version of \\"Hatian Fight Song\\" IS the version heard on those commercials and Oliver Stone's film \\"U-turn\\". <br />  <br />This is NOT easy listening music, if you're a fan of Kenny G you will probably hate this album, and I'm sure Charles Mingus wouldn't have it any other way. <br /> <br />I couldn't hold this album in higher esteem, get it, treasure it, make it a sandwitch before it whips you with a car antenna!
B0002S947K|5.0|this ia a tremdous debut. what a stunning and powerful voice this man has. he is soulful and completely authentic, gentle and fierce.  <br /> <br />listen to this record.  <br /> <br />watch this artist.
0596007124|5.0|I have skimmed through a lot of books related to design patterns, and this is the best beginner book I have found so far. It is fun to read, and easy to understand, More importantly, unlike many other design pattern books which use the same examples over and over again ('mimic' Gang of Four classic Design Pattern book's examples), this book uses different examples that give you a better understanding about how each design pattern can be used. Of course, as described in the book, this is not a reference book or book for guru, because it focuses on more popular patterns, but it does touch on the rest of patterns that are less used, which gives you a good head start. Another good thing about this book is, it also describes the \\"relationship\\" between one pattern and another, and how they can be used together (although more would be nice). Anyhow, if you want to learn Design Pattern, this will be a good start!!!!
0345452585|2.0|When I first read the Amazon review of this novel, I was intrigued.  Never a fan of Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels, I thought I might give this a try since it \\"re-invigorates a number of tried-and-true mystery conventions,\\" was \\"gripping\\" and \\"intricately plotted.\\"  I found this novel to be neither gripping nor intricately plotted; in fact, I found it tedious and quite boring.  The main character of Dr. Jeremy Carrier is neither appealing nor likeable.  He came off has whiny and little self-involved for my taste.  Yeah, yeah, I know he's just been tough a terrible ordeal, but please!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I have seen this film 11 times. Eight times in theatres, and the DVD 3 times. This movie is spectacular. If you have not seen this film, please make it a priority to do so as soon as possible. Yes, it has no plot; but that is the beauty of it all. It is a movie with NO VIOLENCE, NO SEX, and NO FOUL LANGUAGE. It is not corny like \\"family movies.\\" My young sister loved it as much as my father. It really can bring generations together without either getting bored. Some people hate this movie, and I have met them. But I have noticed something about each person that doesnt care for it. The people that do not like this movie are those are RELATE TO NAPOLEON as being a nerd. Perhaps this great film triggers innermost memories of thier personal dorky childhood and it hurts them. The other people who dont like it are just boring and uptight souls anyways. And the third group that doesnt appreciate this film are the types of people that just like to go against the crowd to get attention. You and I know at least one person like that. The ones that crave love and attention so bad, they will turn against thier own conscience to do so.  <br />In any case, please see this movie. I hope you love as much as I have.
1591391105|1.0|If I could give this book no stars, I would. This book is horrible. It contains everything William Zinsser warned us about in his classic book &quot;On Writing Well.&quot; As a new manager I was keen to learn the &quot;how's&quot; of doing the job well. On the outside, this book appeared to be what I needed to help me. I should have read further than the first few pages. &quot;A-Item&quot; action lists, imminently notable ways of expediting your acceleration through your transition, persuading your &quot;convincibles&quot; to &quot;acculturate&quot; themselves to the company's mode of operation....? Huh? (I studied English in university, by the way.) I made it to about page 175 before I collapsed from the fatigue induced by my attempts to decipher what it was Watkins was trying to tell me. Buried among the euphemisms, coined jargon, and plain bad writing, I'm sure, are some valuable lessons for new managers. But untangling the language makes this read less enjoyable and more like a chore. Save your time and money.  My advice: read Marcinko.  He's brash, he's crude, and he writes much better.  He's what I needed.
B000089CJI|4.0|This album is sweet. It is a new sound and great to relax to. I recomend the band Pinback to anyone who likes this CD.
0792164903|5.0|<br />this is definately one of johnny depps best films even thought the blood looks kinda fake like nailpolish its still one of the best films ever
B0002XDODU|5.0|there has been a recent post by \\"Patrick\\" . While referring to the song \\"Amerika\\" , he asks whether it would have been better if there was \\"nazis and hitler\\" instead of \\" coke and america\\" <br /> <br />there is a fatal mistake in asking this question and making this comparison because the alternative to the claims made in the song  \\"amerika\\"   is NOT nazizm or hitler.  <br /> <br />Rammstein never had and will never have anything to do with nazizm or hitler.  <br /> <br />so first lets fix the mislabeling. <br /> <br />second, the criticism of US in the song amerika is valid and is portrayed in a very artistic way.  <br /> <br />you might be offended by the humorous criticism and therefore not like it. <br />but if anybody wishes to criticize the song , they must do it in a valid approach, not by throwing mud at the band or by making false claims about the band which is very creative lyrically. <br /> <br />and above all, americans should stop this self righteousness, whenever they receive criticism. <br /> <br />other than that, this album is a MUST , like the rest of Rammstein albums.  <br /> <br />Regards <br /> <br />P.S : check out the DVD lichtspielhaus too. <br />
B0006IIPIK|5.0|I did not know what was I in for when I got this movie except that it was sci-fi (the trailer of which did not get me to pay for a ticket at the theater) and rated PG, a plus for a family afternoon. <br />Little did I know that Sky Captain was going to throw me back decades into my childhood years. <br />I grew up a big serials fan as in my formative years, my country's local TV channels found it cheaper to rerun old 40s serials than to bring us the current american shows.  Lucky for us, kids from the 70s, the station's thriftness helped us develop a dear affection and appreciation for the Perils of Pauline, Superman, Flash Gordon and the like. <br />This movie comes straight out of those pages.  The seemingly impossible feats, and close calls are straight out of the cliffhanger book. When in one scene all is lost, the next scene recaps to a detail \\"left out\\" that manages to save our heroes.  Awesome! <br />Kids and parents will love that there is no need for gore, nudity, profanity or extra love scenes to satisfy special demographics.  It's just plain old action movie where a lot of the details and story are left out to your imagination making it so much more engaging.  When you are actually discussing with a 6-year old how Dex had managed to hide the map, you are clearly in another world. <br />The movie left me wanting for more so I had to do some research on this website only to find that it was all CGI animation. No wonder the stunning settings!  Like a comic book on film with nothing of the annoying extras found in Spiderman or other adaptations currently on the market. <br />This movie, with all its CGI technology, manages to take you back to an era long-gone. <br />
0679745653|5.0|After watching the movie and really enjoying it, I had to read Breakfast at Tiffany's. The book was a quick but wonderful read. I enjoyed every minute of it and wished it had been a longer.<br /><br />Holly Golightly is the girl everyone admires, she's spontaneous and all about just having fun. She's goes to Tiffany's because it makes her feel good; it's her safe haven when the world is crazy. Holly's escapades are hilarious, she unknowingly aids drug lord, Sally Tomato by visiting him in prison and getting the \\"weather report\\". The movie and Audrey Hepburn did an amazing job portraying Holly Golightly as the reader envisions her, so if you enjoy the movie you will enjoy the book, although the movie had more of a Hollywood ending than Truman Capote's version, Capote's ending remains true to the real Holly Golightly.
B00005RIKI|5.0|This is the best Rock band ever to come out of the South.      Ever.     Better than the Allman's and Marshall Tucker.      Better than bands like the Eagles, Stones and old Aerosmith  with their quasi-southern rock type songs and don't get me wrong those are great bands.  No, original Skynyrd was true classic Southern rock with blues, gospel, country and Zeppelin style guitar blended into one.    The original Skynyrd was the real deal and the best was the first.  \\"Freebird\\" is a classic rock masterpiece and \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" is also great.  Check out also \\"Mississippi Kid\\", very Southern outlaw in your face stuff.      My favorite though  is \\"Simple Man\\" and although slow the words and song stand out as being larger than life.      That song, in my opinion, is greatness.
B00000CQJZ|5.0|Hitchcock can be a magician and predict in 1936 the date when the war with Germany will start : 1939. This spy movie is simple in plot but well dealt with on the screen to look fast and very active. The events are following one another with no pause. A man gets entangled with the death of some free-lance spy, tries to fulfill what he knows of her « mission » and at the same time to escape the police and the spies. The film shows the English are quite ready for a difficult period because they are on the alert all the time and they are ready to report anything that looks strange. Some of course are more complex. The Scot that could have helped the escapee, sells him for a handful of pounds. Not very clear. Another Scot is in fact the head of the spying network. Another, a publican's wife, is helpful because she sees love where there is only fear and forced loyalty. But the woman in that case, who is English, has her eyes wide open and her ears fully active and she finds out the truth and changes sides. And she and the escapee will finally expose and capture the spy and at the same time prove the man's innocence. Hitchcock is telling Europe and the world that there is a serious danger coming up, a war in fact, and that everyone is supposed to be ready to sacrifice even their freedom and peaceful lives to fight back. It is not innocent if the film starts with a music-hall show and ends with another music-hall show in which the main attraction of the first one is appearing again : we are living in a world of fanciful distractions and entertainments that may make us blind to real dangers : wake up Britons, wake up fast. As for the film, it is very interesting that it has not been remasterized and gives us the feel of what it was in those 1930s. That gives a lot more value to the DVD than an artificially colorized version would have.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
1591396190|5.0|This is an especially thought-provoking book which, as have so many others, evolved from an article published in the Harvard Business Review. According to Kim and Mauborgne, \\"[in italics] Blue ocean strategy [end italics] challenges companies to break out of the red ocean of bloody competition by creating uncontested market space that makes the competition irrelevant...This book not only challenges companies but also shows them how to achieve this. We first introduce a set of analytical tools and frameworks that show you how to systematically act on this challenge, and, second, we elaborate the principles that define and separate blue ocean strategy from competition-based strategic thought.\\" There are six principles which are introduced and then discussed on pages 49, 82, 102, 117, 143, and 172, respectively.<br /><br />Frankly, I was somewhat skeptical that this book could deliver on the promises made in its subtitle. In fact, the material provided by Kim and Mauborgne is essentially worthless unless and until decision-makers in a given organization accept the challenge,  are guided and informed by the six principles, and effectively use the tools within appropriate frameworks. The responsibility is theirs, not Kim and Mauborgne's. To assist their efforts, Kim and Mauborgne focus on several exemplary companies which have dominated (if not rendered irrelevant) their competition by penetrating previously neglected market space. They include the Body Shop, Callaway Golf, Cirque du Soleil, Dell, NetJets, the SONY Walkman, Southwest Airlines, Starbucks, the Swatch watch, and Yellow Tail wine.<br /><br />Of greatest interest to me is Kim and Mauborgne's assertion that the innovations which enabled these companies to succeed with a Blue Ocean strategy did NOT depend upon a new technology. Rather, each company pursued a strategy which enabled it to free itself from industry boundaries. For Dell, that meant mass production of computers sold directly to consumers per each customer's specifications. Quite literally, each sale is \\"customized.\\" For Callaway, creating an enlarged sweet spot to increase the frequency of solid contact for new or infrequent golfers just as, years ago, the enlarged Head racquet did so for new or infrequent tennis players. For Starbucks, creating a congenial environment within which to socialize, go online, or read while consuming coffee. All of these Blue Ocean strategies created new or much greater value for customers. Their emphasis is on the quality of experience, not on the benefits of a new technology.<br /><br />According to Kim and Mauborgne, their research indicates that \\"the strategic move, and not the company or the industry, is the right unit of analysis for explaining the creation of blue oceans and sustained high performance. A strategic move is the set of managerial actions and decisions involved in making a major market-creating business offering.\\" The cornerstone of a Blue Ocean strategy is value innovation which occurs \\"only when companies align innovation with utility, price, and cost positions. If they fail to anchor innovation with value in this way, technology innovators and market pioneers often lay the eggs that other companies hatch.\\"  For Kim and Mauborgne, value innovation is about strategy that embraces the entire system of a company's activities. It requires companies to orient the whole system toward achieving a \\"leap\\" in value for both buyers and themselves. Kim and Mauborgne explain HOW to create uncontested market space wherein competition is essentially irrelevant.<br /><br />To paraphrase Henry Ford, whether decision-makers think they can or think they can't do that, they're right.ach customer's specifications.

B00008EY65|4.0|First of all, I'm not a SCI-FI fan and have never read a single comic book in my life so this review is not based on my previous love/hate of this character or the comic book it is based on.<br /><br />The one thing I really like in the movie is the lead character of HellBoy and the actor Ron Perlman who played it to near perfection. This was the first time I even knew there's a comic-book character called HellBoy but watching Ron Perlman playing him felt like I know the character for a long time. The plot of the movie in reasonably interesting and you won't feel bored by different twists and turns. The director could've done more on the character development of the other characters except the lead role but the lead character's interestingly funny performance compensates that to quite an extent. This could be because I don't know other characters (as I've never read the comics it is based upon) but many other characters are just like two-dimensional pictures filling the scenery. A little more effort could've brought this movie at par with Spiderman2 where every character is alive and fitting in the movie.<br /><br />I played this movie for my 4-year old son but both my wife and I ended up watching it and we actually enjoyed this as a family movie. There's no blood and guts flying all over the horizon, there's no vulgarity in the dialogs even when they're spoken by the villains and there're no super-sexy barely dressed female heroes/villains so you can practically sit with your kids and watch this movie ... and enjoy it.
B00005JN4O|5.0|WONDERFUL! thats the word that comes to mind when i think of this movie. i'm not going to give anything away-watch and find out! but by the end there wasn't a dry eye in the cinerma, kate winslet and the boy who played peter did a fantastic job.

0671004611|3.0|Did it ever occur to anyone (perhaps any fellow R.V.'s, Metaphysicalites or Quadriviates), that the Roswell, New Mexico FCTRM (Foreign Craft Technology Recovery Mission) was implemented by our scientists and government officials was considered then ordered to be classified as top secret for a reason? <br /> <br />Perhaps, the little grey \\"celestial occupants\\" that were recovered (and described as rather \\"clinical\\" with emotionally cold, large  \\"matter-of-fact\\" eyes) were high-tech cyborg-like Oslo's developed by the Honda Corporation and sent by someone or some \\"thing\\" that resembles us from our future...perhaps, maybe from the year 2340 or 2540? Maybe the future of mankind looked extremely grim to our leading scientists and U.S. Government officials from the late 1940's as they slowly uncovered and played the craft's memory bank micro-chips.  Perhaps all of our U.S. Officials and Physicists from the 1940's wished they uncovered a craft from \\"another world\\" as opposed to discovering and learning some grim and disheartening news about man's destiny and eventual demise?

Absolution shows off Muse's wide range of musical ability- from pounding piano keys to the ingenious Stockholm Syndrome- it's got it all! I look forward to their new music, it just keeps getting better!  The only track that is relatively 'weaker' (not really, considering it still got a 5/5 rating) would be 'Sing for Absolution': it's a bit cheesy I suppose.  But overall, BRILLIANT!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This one started with a semi-retarded teen and I groaned because there has been a spate of retarded comedy characters of late.  I'm thinking of What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Punch Drunk Love.  In the last twenty years, you can throw in fifty or sixty teen outcast comedies with interchangeable casts. The pariah could be an ugly duckling teen girl as in She's All That or a whole cast of teen misfits of both sex's as in Things I like About You.  Napoleon Dynamite takes these concepts to their logical conclusion thereby closing out any possibility that future teen saga's could be original.    Are there mentally challenged adolescents in modern civilization like Napoleon or his dim internet-dating brother?  I always asked that question about the Three Stooges.  I need to get over my desire for sophisticated, reality based comedy, and I must accept the quirky world of Indie farce.  Once over this hurdle, I settle down into the underdog theatre of teen losers and enjoy their ultimate triumph. I recommend Napoleon Dynamite and give it four stars.
B00065JTBA|5.0|I have to admit, when i heard that bon jovi was releasing songs that did not make it onto any albums, i was slightly worried about the quality of the box set. But let me say this, it took me 5 days to even get past the first CD. The whole box set is absolutely wonderful. I even added pumped up tracks like taking it back, why arent you dead, billy and sympathy to my gym workout soundtrack. These guys are extremely talented. In total there two songs on the whole album that i dont like (outlaws of love and the song tico sings  - which is quite comical to me- sorry)Their ballads are moving and their rock tunes definitely rock. Not only that but by listening to these songs you get a better understanding of the band, no matter how long you've been a fan. You can see where some of the melodies, guitar riffs and lyrics/phrases on songs that were released could have come from (ie \\"I'm going down down down down down: - on \\"out of bounds\\" is the same phrase as in \\"two story town\\" off of crush.- there are many more similarities in the set that can be found as well) Its a great insight. Similarily, there is jon's love of the phrase \\"Open all night\\" which he used in two songs on this box set, plus on the bounce album. Furthermore there are also may catchy phrases in some of the tunes \\"keep your sugar punk, hip hop, pop-rock junk and your digital downloads\\" comes to mind - no matter how cheesy it may sound, its so awesome to sing along to!!. Everyday i wake up with a new song off the box set stuck in my head and everyday i need my bon jovi box set fix. The ballads like \\"last chance train\\" and \\"kidnap an angel\\" are just beauiful and i must say that all of the songs have such catchy lovable verses just as they do choruses, which grab your attention right way at the beginning of each song. Their lyrics are real, raw and maybe sometimes overly dramatic/cheesy, (leave a flower at the station, i know my destination - love bring me home again\\"), yet absolutely breathtaking and will haveyou singing along and feeling the song for sure. Richie's song is incredibly moving and david bryan's song is very heart felt. Tico..hmmm...what to say about tico...kind of hard on my ears to listen to..not really my type, but i will never say anything bad because i respect him and i guess the band had to include a solo song for each member, because 3 out of 4 would probably have been hard to sell..i would not have wanted to be around for that meeting..anyway, my conclusion is this - run, now, go out and buy it, i give you my personal guarantee that you will not be disappointed.
B00005JN4O|5.0|MOVIE: The story of the real Peter Pan, James Mathew Barrie.  The movie opens with Barrie impatiently waiting for reaction on his latest play, he is off to the side watching people's reactions.  At the end it  turns out to be a failure, and his producer who is played by Dustin Hoffman is beginning to become impatient with him.  As Barrie spends one of his afternoons at the park he meets a widowed mother and her four sons. He becomes inspired by the children's soaring minds and imagination and befriends them. However one of the boys, Peter, looks at everything at a literal level.  He still is hanging over the fact that his father died, and playing pretend doesn't seem to cover up reality. The audience sees that Barrie himself is still a child as he teaches the boys to open their minds through various adventures. He ends up spending day after day with the family and becomes close to the mother, played by Kate Winslet.  The grandmother of the family does not approve of Barrie spending all this time with them, and neither does Barrie's wife or the rest of the city.  Sexuality is played around as one of the themes.  Most of the folk feel that  spending time with these children is showing sexual intrest. His wife feels that he is doing this just for Mrs. Davies (Winslet). The audience sees this separation between Barrie and his wife, and she comes across more as his mother than his companion.  They even sleep in seperate rooms.  That is just a small theme addressed, but the major idea of the film is holding on to what you cherish.  Barrie, while although very smart, grows up with these children in a sense.  He is placed into a new role, and as he meets the children he could fit as their sibling, but as time progresses he fits a more fatherly role to them.  The ending will tug at your heart, and while it is tragic it sends the message that no matter what life delivers you, everything you hold dear will stay in Neverland.  All you have to do is close your eyes and you can revisit everything you cherish at anytime.<br /><br />ACTING/DIRECTING: This year's Best Actor category is tough, and Johnny Depp has a very good chance of taking it.  This is truly the best work he has ever done.  His portrayal of Barrie is poignant and heartfelt.  Marc Foster's visual style of Barrie's imagination is truly vivid and wonderful.  The audience takes a step through the doorway into the mind of a fascinating writer.  The cinematography was also some of the most captivating I've seen in a while.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Touching, funny, tragic, and heartfelt.  Finding Neverland is an amazing story of finding one's self and finding the things that make us happy and complete.  While sometimes in our lives we may lose the things that complete us, mentally we will always be attached, never letting them escape our thoughts.  Take the opportunity to see Finding Neverland in theaters before the big night.  Most of the major nominees are being re-released due to Oscar publicity, and this one shouldn't be missed.evisit everything you cherish at anytime. <br /> <br />ACTING/DIRECTING: This year's Best Actor category is tough, and Johnny Depp has a very good chance of taking it.

0671027344|5.0|What a good book!  The author must have been a \\"wallflower\\" himself, because I just cant see him hitting some thoughts and events so perfectly without him having firsthand experience.  With use of great writing and short sections he keeps you turning pages and wanting more.  I must say though this book is not for everybody.  It's one of those you will either love it or hate it.  But in order to like the book I think you might have to be able to put yourself in Charlie's shoes.  The thing I liked most about this book was probably hearing from someone else about the same things I think about.  But it's definently a great book and would recomend it to anyone who thinks outside the box a little bit.
B00006JI8V|5.0|Sonata Arctica's debut album not only launched them into success and reknown, but it showed the world that power metal can be about other things than dragons and middle earth.  The melodic qualities as well as Tony's voice makes each and every song its own.  Kingdom for a heart, Destruction preventor, Unopened, and Replica stand out as well-thought tracks.  Sonata Arctica is coming to Atlanta in April, and no way will I miss it.
0618526412|3.0|McCullers certainly has a way with words; the writing is beautiful.  The story is more driven by characters than by plot and there is no doubt that it is a sad, slow story where race, politics, and poverty converge.   <br /> <br />My disappointment is not with the book itself, but with its placement on the The Publishing Triangle's list of 100 best lesbian and gay novels.  Modern readers expecting gay/lesbian content will be disappointed.  It is possible to construe Singer's behavior as motivated by same-sex affection, but that is the only portion of the story with a gay subtext; many readers may not even read Singer as gay.  Granted, at the time the novel was written, gay content was often coded, but there are other novels from the same period with much clearer gay/lesbian content.  While it appears McCullers had feelings for another woman that does not qualify her works as gay/lesbian \\"novels\\"; perhaps a list of gay/lesbian novelists is a more appropriate place for McCullers works <br />

There are also many quiter songs, Interstate Love Song, Big Empty. <br />Their isn't one song that I dislike on this CD <br /> <br />Meatplow- 9.5/10 Good opener <br />Vasoline- 10/10 First Single, very catchy <br />Lounge Fly- 9/10  <br />Interstate Love Song- 10/10 Quiet Song, very good <br />Still Remains- 9/10  <br />Pretty Penny- 8/10 A little strange, but very good <br />Silvergun Superman- 9/10 Hard, very good <br />Big Empty- 10/10 another quiet song, one of the best on the CD <br />Unglued- 10/10 Probably my favorite on CD, harder rock <br />Army Ants- 9/10  <br />Kitchenware & Candybars- 9/10 kinda depressing but overall good song <br />Bonus Track- 6/10 really wierd and not so great, but i guess why its a bonus track.  <br />
B0006M4SO6|5.0|The Way up is PMG's most ambitious album in years, maybe ever. Which is saying a lot, considering the compositional density of Letter From Home, Still Life Talking or First Circle. This release harkens back to various periods of the group's evolution, and while borrowing styles and melodic fragments from previous compositions (something classical composers have been doing for centuries,) it is by no means merely a rehashed stew of past phases, but a marvelously constructed piece that stands on its own, a synthesis of where of the group has been, infused with hints of where they're heading.<br /><br />Impossible to absorb in one sitting, The Way Up, like any large work, has to be listened to a number of times to appreciate the sweep of its compositional arc. Apparent on the first go round are short phrases that weave through the piece and a returning Reichian minimalism that surfaces now and again. Occasionally, tight unison hard bop lines come into focus, only to be absorbed as a new texture takes its place in a kaleidoscopic tapestry of sound.  There are plenty of through composed sections, as meaty as anything Pat and Lyle have ever come up with, yet there's enough blowing time to satisfy hardcore jazz fans as well.<br /><br />In short, this album gives a Metheny group lover everything they have come to expect from the Group, with perhaps one exception. Lyle Mays seems to play a lesser role in this project than I would've like to see. If I remember correctly, there's only one extended piano solo, although as consolation to May's fans, it is a burning one. Besides that one featured solo, there are a couple of short Lyle piano moments, but for the most part Metheny's varied guitar textures seem to dominate the foreground of the aural landscape with Mays attending to the coloristic detail in the background. Due to Metheny's predominant presence, this CD sometimes reminds me of Metheny's solo project, \\"Secret Story\\", the primary difference being this is more of a coherent whole and doesn't have added orchestral arrangements. While Lyle's playing may take a subordinate role in the proceedings, his talent for arranging and development can be felt throughout. Pat and Lyle are a great writing team, and over time,  this album may very well rank with their best work.rent whole and doesn't have added orchestral arrangements.

B00003CX96|3.0|I must admit I'm at a loss to understand why this has been such a popular small film.  It's listed on the NY Times \\"1000 Best Movies of All Time,\\" published in 2004, has always had good word of mouth, and other Amazon users obviously think highly of it as well.  Personally I don't get it. <br /> <br />OK, it's not a clunker.  The four friends who are the heart of this film, local kids in a college town who are looked down on by the college students as being inferior, are definitely well-drawn characters.  By the end of the movie we know them as if they were kids who have lived down the street from us for years.  That's a rare enough thing that it warrants a 3-star rating in itself. <br /> <br />However, the result of a climactic bike race (and everything that happens during the race) is totally obvious from the start.  Furthermore, the baddest \\"villain\\" college guy in the film is about as intimidating as a cold bowl of soup, and about as interesting, which completely destroys any attempt at dramatic tension between the two sides. <br /> <br />The phony Italian accent and \\"exchange student\\" act put on by the main character is unconvincing in the extreme; any college girl who'd fall for that would be a complete idiot, but Robyn Douglass's character is never represented as anything but sympathetic, certainly not an idiot; this just does not work.  And I'm amazed to see that Paul Dooley, who plays the phony exchange student's father, got such praise for his work in this role; to me his acting is on the level of a skit on SNL. <br /> <br />Beyond those problems, the only other positive I can think of is that the film maintains an authentic feel by filming on location and, by working within a small budget, so it isn't overproduced and overdirected like a \\"bigger\\" project would've been. <br /> <br />The comparison to \\"Rocky\\" is obvious, and with this film having come out about three years after that Stallone breakthrough, I have to think its reputation comes from critics and moviegoers of that era longing for a similar film.  So many truly dreadful copycats came out in that time that this, by comparison, must have seemed golden at the time.  But it simply doesn't hold up a quarter-century later.  Maybe part of my problem here is that this kind of underdog sports has been done to death by now, but this won an Oscar for best screenplay and was nominated for others?  Puh-leeze...
B00005JMK0|5.0|With all of the bad movies that have come out on DVD....this is a classic that needs to be released.
B000069HK2|5.0|This album is great.  I got it when it first came out from recommendation of a friend, and I thought, \\"This album is pretty good.\\"  It's one of those albums that 'grow' on you.  It's not an immediate love.  You may really like it when you first get it, but as you listen to it more, your appreaciation for it grows.  The lyrics and the meaning behind it are thought provoking.  There's a perfect mixture of harder and softer songs.  The acoustic of \\"On My Own\\" is beautiful.  Bert's voice is beautiful in \\"Blue and Yellow\\".  \\"Taste Of Ink\\" and \\"A Box Full of Sharp Objects\\" are the two greatest songs.  It has emo quality, but I wouldn't consider it emo since emo can't have choruses.  I wouldn't call it punk, since it's not the 'head-bopping' type.  I wouldn't call it metal, well because it's definitely not.  I would consider it a mix of rock genres. <br /> <br />I have noticed several (or maybe just few) commenting on Bert's vomitting.  It's not like he tries to throw up...he has an illness.  Oh, and also, they aren't played on MTV (maybe MTV2), because if they were, my respect for them would go way down.  I don't buy into any of of that pop or TRL sh*t, even though I do sometimes watch it for the guest stars or there's nothing else on. <br /> <br />Don't buy this album if you are all into the \\"screamo\\" fad, which I absolutely loathe.  Buy it for the music.  Appreciate it, and respect the band.  Don't comment for the sake of slamming on the band members.  Express your opinions on the music, not the people in it.  After all, this review is here in order to help the comsumer decide on a CD, not a DVD or concert ticket. <br />
B000002LIR|4.0|Having been listening to this collection again recently I felt compelled to review it, and can't believe no-one else has yet, well here goes!  Up to date at the time of its' release it stands as a pretty good testament to Rods' work, starting with the Rod The Mod era, through early classics like \\"Handbags and Gladrags\\" and \\"Gasoline Alley\\", it moves through his really hot period of the mid to late seventies, on to his fling with the disco era \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy\\" (ouch!!) and finally to a return to form with \\"Downtown Train\\".  The early material shows his true raw talent, particularly with \\"I A'int Supersticious\\" performed with the Jeff Beck Group and \\"Stay With Me\\", easily the best thing the Faces ever recorded.  Those unfamiliar with his back catalogue can discover gems such as \\"Cut Across Shorty\\" and \\"Every Picture Tells A Story\\".  There are some throw away tracks within the package, (otherwise would be 5 stars), but it includes all his major hits.  As a box set it is a very good compilation and definitely shows why Rod Stewart is amongst the most talented performers the UK (sorry Scotland) has ever produced.
0385513755|5.0|I'd been wanting to read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" for a while.  When my fiance surprised me with the illustrated edition, I was happy that I'd finally get a chance to read the book, but I also didn't understand why there was an illustrated edition available.  Once I started reading, however, I was very grateful to have the illustrated edition in hand.<br /><br />Revealing too much of the plot of this book will take away from the pleasure of reading it, so I'm not going to say too much.  Basically, the story begins when someone is murdered at the Louvre museum, setting into motion a cryptic chain of events that lead to a religious secret which has been kept under wraps for thousands of years.  This is a fast-paced, intriguing novel that elaborates on actual conspiracy theories that have been talked about for centuries.  (Now I understand why certain religious circles are all up in arms about the content of this book!)  I think that anyone who has even a remote interest in theology will love this book, and anyone else just looking for a good thriller to read will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Dan Brown references many historical landmarks and objects in his book, which is why this illustrated edition is so convenient.  Unless you have a very strong background in art and religious history and know Paris and London like the back of your hand, chances are that you'll get a little lost in some places, which is where the illustrations come in.  Photographs of historical landmarks and images of famous works of art act as key reference points throughout the book that will make reading it even more enjoyable.<br /><br />If you haven't read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" yet, I highly suggest you do it soon and not wait for Hollywood to butcher the story with the movie version.  I also recommend shelling out the extra few bucks needed to purchase the illustrated edition: you'll be glad you did.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|The movie, first of all, was a romantic's classic.  It explored all aspects of love, from the good the bad...this may actually be one for the permanent DVD collection.   <br /> <br />But the soundtrack was equally great.  songs from when i was 5 years old to now that i'm 24 were spread throughout.  But if no one will comment on this, then i will: Hugh Grant's scene as the Prime Minister when he starts dancing to The Pointer Sisters' \\"JUMP\\" is priceless.  Especially the ending parts of that scene when he is caught dancing around.  Its so funny I think because we all perform around the house, and with sincerity and intention to act and sound like the artist(s) we are mimicking...it was a hilarious scene that I rewound too many times. <br /> <br />Also, at the end of the movie the repetition of \\"God only knows what i'd be without you\\" line from the song by The Beach Boys was one of those songs that allows you to drive home to central point of the movie through imagery and sound: while watching all of these forms of love and hearing those lyrics over and over was just a very peaceful feeling to know that, as the movie stated, love actually is all around. <br /> <br />hope this helped someone decide on the movie or the soundtrack...i say go for both. <br />thanks
B000059Z8J|5.0|Christopher Reeve was very well known because he was in this film.Christopher Reeve did not have to act in this movie.He was a hero in life.Even though he was paralyzed he still cared,thinked,and loved other people.I was very sad when Christopher  Reeve died .He almost died in 1995,but he was a Superman and he survived now he died for good.  <br />                                              In Memoriam, <br />                           Christopher Reeve(Superman)
B000002GVO|5.0|I used to borrow my Dad's cassette tape of this album, and play it all the time when I was little...along with other bands such as Tom Petty and Rush.<br /><br />I can't say enough about this album. Tipped as one of the best rock albums of all time and one of the top selling albums of all times, this has to be the peak LP for The Eagles. I believe that 5 of the tracks from this album were put into \\"Hell Freezes Over\\". he only album from The Eagles to have more than one No. 1 song, this is definitely the pioneer of all classic rock albums. From \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\", \\"The Last Resort\\" to \\"Hotel California\\" and \\"Wasted Time\\", this adds color to my life.
B000000YG5|5.0|I hear everybody been talkin' 'bout this album. 'Cuz it changed the history of jazz music. As to say Sonny Rollins is such a powerful Genius when he's plays his saxophone real well. The best signature song to date from him is \\"St. Thomas\\" which I seen from the documentary JAZZ by Ken Burns. I recommend this along with Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, the movie Bird, and the classic album from Outkast, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below.
1592400876|2.0|Although I did get some good information from Ms Truss' book, I have to agree with what another reviewer here, Olly Buxton, wrote; particularly his reference to her \\"hectoring.\\"  I think the tone of this book is the very essence of pedantry but hey, I'm an American.<br /><br />She goes on about \\"sticklers\\" like herself staring hang-jawed and dumbfounded at the utterly shocking grammatical errors she finds on hand-written signs in grocers' as if it's a personal insult, but she fails to see how insulting and snobbish her own melodramatic reactions are.  If I ever see her poised over some sign of mine with a permanent marker, I'll turn a hose on her.<br /><br />I also think she may be exaggerating a bit when she points out the kinds of errors she spots including plurals expressed with a comma (apple,s).  I've never seen that error in all my life.  That sort of gratuitous piling-on undermines her arguments.<br /><br />I also agree with Mr Buxton about the author's clumsiness with humor.  I first heard the Panda joke well told on one of Garrison Keillor's  \\"Prairie Home Companion\\" annual \\"Joke Shows\\" on the radio and when I read Truss' version incorporating a \\"poorly punctuated wildlife manual,\\" I winced (but very briefly and without making a big pretentious show of it).<br /><br />Although it's not really a grammar book, Robert Bringhurst's excellent \\"The Elements of Typographic Style\\" covers some of the same topics albeit with more engrossing history and a far drier wit.  I'd strongly recommend it over this for an informative and entertaining read.
0385507755|2.0|Being an alcoholic/addict myself, i found this book to be a huge disservice to recovering people or people who'd like recover. Why? Because its filled with the typical egocentric, self-important, pseudointellectual ramblings of an addict. There is no humility in it which is essential to recovery, in my opionion.  <br /> <br />I wonder what the point was in publishing it. Who is it supposed to help? Who benefits? I didn't need another depressing story. <br /> <br />Despite his claimed horrific alcoholic/drug experiences, Frey proposes a recovery plan of self-will/knowledge; not believing in God or AA for some odd reason. Eventhough, it is evident that AA principles are working for him while in treatment, he choses instead to look for answers in his own messed up thoughts. Thoughts which he even admits are defective (the Fury). - Good plan, James.   <br /> <br />Frey, not able to see that the essential help he receives in his recovery is from simple people with a simple belief system must look to the Tao for answers. I am sure he is sincere, though, and it makes perfect sense in his own mind. <br /> <br />I really wish him the best of luck in his recovery or revelation, whatever the case may be, but I wonder of the effectiveness of his plan when I see in the final analysis that the people in his life that were so important to him die or are incarcerated. If your insight was so profound why not share with those who are supposedly your 'friends'.  <br /> <br />No, this book should be avoided at ALL costs by the addict/alcoholic. It is a troubling, pernicious work of literature. Instead pick up the AA related literature if you want knowledge and/or real help with this disease. It is not something to be reasoned out of as proposed in 'A million little pieces\\".  <br /> <br />
0385510454|5.0|on't understand all the negative reviews; this is a gripping story with non-stop suspense.  Plus, the descriptions if life in Bologna were interesting; also the Italian lessons; I learned a little bit of it.  And, while Joel is a rascal he really is sort of appealing and you keep rooting for him.  Lighten up, people, this is just a GOOD story, not the Great American Novel!!
B00005JG6Q|4.0|When I first watched this movie, I knew nothing about anime whatsoever, and I'd never seen any Japanese films at all.  I didn't know anything about Akira either, I was just bored one saturday night, and my roommate had a copy of it.  I'd heard of it, so I figure maybe I ought to watch it to kill some time till  later on.  I was really blown away, from the first bits of the film on--the opening chase scene is a brilliant hook.  About halfway through, some of my friends went to a bar, but I was way too enthralled to leave.  The animation is very good, way better than I expected, and some of the dream-like visuals are stunning and use the medium very well.  There are some scenes that just couldn't be done without being animated.  The story's pretty interesting, and I don't know if I understand it completely, but it certainly isn't something where you stop watching and have no idea what happened.  It generally makes sense.  I've gotten lots of people who \\"hate\\" anime to watch this film, and they've all really liked it.  If you're thinking of tiny people with huge heads and HUGE eyes, really small mouths, with a lot of screaming and lazy animation--this movie is nothing like that at all.  Good for anybody.  The only thing that bugs me is the dubbing isn't great (never is), and some of the script is kinda dumb/irritating (like a lot of anime), but that's more a function of the way the young characters are at times portrayed than bad writing I think.  It's definitely a very minor issue.  Oh yeah, and the music rules!!!  Another good thing to try if you don't necessarily like big-eyed japanimation is the animatrix dvd--some of the shorts are really weird and cool.
B00006IUOZ|5.0|While I did not see the original Norwegian version of this film, I intend to do so after reading about it amongst these many great reviews.    L.A. Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) travels to Alaska with his partner to investigate the murder of a local girl. Not only must Dormer face the daunting task of finding the killer, but he must also cope with the never setting sun, which eventually deprives him from much needed sleep. He also kills his partner by accident, and must also construct a way out of that as well. The movie's location in the beauty and lushness of Alaska make you want to pack up the camper and head there for a month. It really added to the depth of the film, as opposed to it taking place in the \\"lower 48\\".    Once Pacino and his partner arrive at their destination, they are greeted by Detective Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank), who idolizes Dormer. While I felt that this was kind of annoying at first,  it was interesting to see the pivitol point where she transitions from trusting and admiring Dormer to suspecting him of killing his partner. While the chief of police seemed grateful for Dormer's assistance, I  sensed resentment from the other local cops at his presence. It seemed as though they were subconciously saying \\"Why bring in an outsider when we are just as capable?\\" Nevertheless, the local officers eventually warm up to him and begin to trust and depend on his experience and expertise to catch the killer, played by Robin Williams. While Williams' performance as a villan was not on par with his phenomenal work in \\"One Hour Photo\\", he still plays his character well. He is the only witness to Dormer's shooting of his partner, and he uses this as psychological leverage throughout the second half of the film.     The movie climaxes with Dormer chasing Williams through an old fishing cabin. A must see!
0312995423|5.0|The novel had me by the neck.<br /><br />Technical quibbles from nitpicking critics notwithstanding, it's spectacular high-speed thriller material: fast pace, punchy dialogue, very believable plot with clever twists, and, as typical of Brown's work, a delectably global setting.<br /><br />Sure the descriptions of NSA may fall short of pitch perfection but they're made up for the most part by some sparkling wit, e.g., NSA being so cloak-and-dagger as to define itself as No Such Agency. Do NSA agents use password-free screensavers or a five digit password for a supercomputer? Who knows. May be they put a lot of trust in their hardware infrastructural security. No trivialities of this sort make the story any less thrilling.<br /><br />The crypto theme and the lengths to which a national security organization is willing to go is thought-provoking if nothing else. Had me wondering if all this loss of privacy and violation of human rights is justified by the number of all the devious terrorist plots foiled and lives spared daily. An intriguing dilemma.<br /><br />Above all else I'm beginning to have a great deal of respect for Brown's research caliber. Some technological sections sound so frighteningly plausible it's hard to believe they came from a small town English teacher. He makes sure he adds some ribbing academic humour into his lead character, surely a reflection of his own real life.<br /><br />Sure a lot of things fall in place for the global espionage angle to work, but if a bit of technology doesn't intimidate you (all well explained anyway) I recommend this enthralling thriller in a blink.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix works because it repackages themes from older movies, and, indeed, older literature and mythology, in a cutting edge, sci-fi cinematic wrapping. It's more than just a wrapping actually. In reworking the old ideas it adds nuances that may or may not have existed (or at least explicitly expressed) earlier.<br /><br />Cinematically, there's a strong thread going back to Kubrick's 2001. HAL 9000 (each letter of HAL is one away from IBM) turns on his human companions to murder them.<br /><br />A decade later, Darth Vader appeared on the screen, a lethal, murderous monster, \\"more machine than man.\\" Again, the creation (machine) turns on creator. (At the same time, there are nice, even heroic machines: C3PO and R2-D2).<br /><br />In the next decade we were introduced to The Terminator. Governor Arnold (when he was just a mega-star, millionnaire plebian like the rest of us) comes from the future, where Machines have almost wiped out the human race, to kill the mother of the future leader. Once more, inhuman machine turned murderous against its creator.<br /><br />The Matrix takes this to a whole new level. The Machines have already won. There's just a few stragglers who have not succumbed. The new, ingenious twist is that they are controlled not so much by physical force but by mind: the Matrix software that feeds directly into the brain and leads humans to believe they live normal lives when \\"in reality\\" they sit in life support pods providing electrical power for the machines. It truly is the grand illusion.<br /><br />This theme goes back, cinematically, to classic silent film, Metropolis, as well (in a different way) to Frankenstein.<br /><br />Before the advent of movies -- indeed, before technology and the Industrial Revolution -- this idea was found in ancient lore and mythology. The Golem of Jewish lore or Beowulf, for instance.<br /><br />The bottom line of all these themes, though, is the internal struggle that goes on for each human being. The part of us that is human, feeling and has a heart vs. the part of us that is inhuman, unfeeling and cold-blooded. (Jurassic Park also explores the reemergence of cold-blooded human nature; not so much the dinosaurs and T-Rex, which nowadays is assumed was probably warm-blooded, but corporate greed that puts making money above human life.)<br /><br />In the end, these movies, and other expressions, persist in human culture, because the hero discovers his humanity, and, with it, an appreciation of his humanity.<br /><br />HAL 9000 is dismantled; David Bowman, a Messiah-figure (\\"David\\") survives and is reborn.<br /><br />Darth Vader, starting with Episode V and climaxing in Episode VI, teaches us that even someone so far gone that he's \\"more machine than man,\\" can regain his humanity.<br /><br />Arnold returns in T-2 to be the good guy, the father figure, humanity's savior. He's really all of us who have struggled with our dark side, our unfeeling side, our addicted side (the addict turns monster in pursuit of his fix) -- our tendency toward inhumanity.<br /><br />The Matrix works for many reasons, and has many facets, but its main one, in my opinion, is this age-old theme. We are not machines. We are not strapped into our fate. We can change. We can escape. We can overcome addiction -- be it to alcohol, some illegal substance, nicotine, porn, greed, food, TV, etc. We can rediscover our humanity, even in a very insane, often inhumane world, whose technological influence is all-pervasive and -- almost -- All-Powerful.g.

B000087F6M|3.0|It doesn't stink as much as some reviewers have foisted off on this site, but don't go expecting a tight plot.<br /><br />Somewhere along the way the scriptwriters seem to have gone berserk with expensive attempts to be all things to all people -- goofball romantic comedy, courtroom melodrama, high-octane thriller with flaming pyrotechnics. The overloaded plot revolves around an assistant D.A. who gets involved with a defense lawyer to solve a convoluted case that includes arson, art robbery, insurance fraud, even murder.<br /><br />It's almost as if the plot was not the point. The 22-carat charisma of Robert Redford and the starry-eyed charm of Debra Winger is what keeps the film afloat with some delicious chemistry. Daryl Hannah is very effective as the spaced-out daughter, who spends most of the movie seeming sexy and/or guilty.<br /><br />The whole mishmash ends up significantly less than the sum of its parts, which is sad because with only slightly better editing it stood on the brink of being an excellent film. That, it isn't.
078624495X|5.0|This book was outstanding it took a very large ordeal and shrunk it to the story of the 1st battalion, 7th cavalry. And the personal accounts that these people had in the Ia Drang valley in Vietnam.  This was one of the most significant events in America's history.  There were some 450 men in this battalion; they were immediately surrounded by some 2000 Vietnamese soldiers that would only stop fighting when they were all dead. It told the story of the unselfishness that our American soldiers have for each other; probably one of the most touching events through out the book.  These soldiers cared for each other all the way through the battle. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to people who like attention grabbing books because this was definitely one of them.  Also if you like learning about Americas history this is the book for you it hits many points and makes you question what we did and why did we do it.  I personally don't like to read but this book was well worth it and I did not want to put it down once I started reading it.  So I do highly recommend this to everyone it's a great read full of action and now I want to go rent the movie to see all the action that I visualized while reading. So don't sit there and read anymore of this and go get the book what are you waiting for? Go get it now... <br />
B00008PC2O|5.0|Set 10 years after the events of the first movie, two terminators are sent back through time in the year 1991. One is a good guy ( Arnold Schwartzenger) whom has to protect young John Conner ( Edward Furlough)from the deadly shapeshifting T-1000 ( Robert Patrick) because one day John will be a future leader. With the help of the heroine Sarah Conner ( Linda Hamilton) from the original movie, she with John & The Terminator have to prevent an upcoming war that will lead to the future and must outdo the T-1000.<br /><br />A sequel that works higher than the original movie which was a classic by the way. James Cameron with Arnold have returned in this highly expensive sequel that was probably the costliest movie in Carolco's history, however when it opened on July 2 1991 it has became one of the highest grossing movies of time with critical acclaim and academy awards for best make-up, best special effects, and best editing. What truly made it a new action/sci-fi classic is that the film contained unbelivable special effects by ILM for it's time like no one has ever seen before, great acting, flawless direction & writing by James Cameron, non-stop action and heart to go with the movie.<br /><br />The Extreme Edition DVD has some very good extras like Commentary by James Cameron and co-writer William Wisher, Extreme Interactive mode with graphic commentary and behind the scenes footage, superior sound & picture quality by THX. Two featurettes and a few PC-DVD.Rom features as well, this is truly a must have DVD for those who loves movies either action, Science Fiction, the original Terminator or just plain movies.
B0006IIPJ4|4.0|That is all you need to know about this movie.  The story is the usual fare about a hero saving the world from the monsters.  It is beautiful to look at and the retro look is perfect for this type of movie.  Both Jude Law and Gweneth Paltrow are average as the leads, altough there is chemistry between them.  As I said, there is nothing new here but that doesn't matter.  It is very cool to look at.  The film is based on the old serials of the late forties and early fifties.  Think of the fun of \\"Raiders of the Lost Arc\\" and the darkness of \\"Batman\\" and you catch the feel of \\"Sky Captain\\".  There are ray guns and metal monsters along with evil bad guys.  There is a villianess that is down right creepy becasue she is never explained.  This is eye candy, nothing more but that is OK because it is such pleasing eye candy.  Highly Reccomended.
B00006EXL5|4.0|I've read a lot of reviews that accuse this band of taking themselves too seriously. After all, Gerard sings about blood and exploding brains and skull fragments falling like pixie dust. You can't get more goth-wannabe than that. But wait! Just read the front of their cd: \\"unauthorized duplication is a violation of applicable laws and will result in Gerard coming to your house and sucking your blood.\\" Oh yeah, you can just hear the oozing sincerity and pompousness and graveness there. I'm being sarcastic, by the way. <br /> <br />Sure, the band sings about some serious stuff. But just listen to the WAY Gerard sings it. The lyrics of the songs are dark and brooding for sure; but the tone of the songs take on a more exaggerated and humorous tone, much like the way the ever present and overly serious do-not-make-illegal-copies warning is twisted into something humorous on this album. <br /> <br />The pace of the songs flirts with frantic most of the time.  Many of them--Demolition Lovers, Vampires will Never Hurt You, Headfirst for Halos-- start out melodic and pretty sane. Then they quickly build up into something that verges on chaotic, only barely managing to retain just the right bit of harmony at their loudest and most chaotic points, leaving a favorable impression.   <br /> <br />As much as I liked the songs, I didn't give this cd a five star rating because its production just sucked. Gerard's voice, while refreshingly raw, sounded too muffled. The sound could have been crisper, and Gerard's voice should have been turned up a bit more.  <br /> <br />Overall, though, this is a very enjoyable cd if you don't take yourself too seriously =P. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B00030590I|5.0|You have to see this movie.  It is utterly fantastic.  it works on many levels, not just as a kung fu movie. There is plenty of action , enough for the most die hard action fan.  But the movie is incredibly well acted and the story is perfect as it is.  if there was no action, it still would be an incredible movie.  if you like \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", then you will love this film.  It is every bit as good as \\"Crouching Tiger\\".  The scenery is beautiful and is shot on location in China.  Yimou Zhang has done a remarkable job with both the colors and the choreography for the fight scenes.  The film is just plain beautiful to look at not to mention the action.  The action is actually better than \\"Crouching Tiger\\".  This is just a remarkable film. <br /> <br />The story is about a Hero called \\"nameless\\" protecting the Emperor of China from a band of assasins.  Jet Li plays the Hero and he tells the story of the duels with the assasins.  To tell any more that this will ruin the movie for you.  Just let it be said that there is much more than just what I told you here.  There is also the usual extras with the DVD and it is a mini documentary on the film and what the crew tried to do.  That is whorth the price alone.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This cd is great.  Some of you that lived through the 60's complain of Jet sounding like the bands you grew up listening to. Well, at 26, I am grateful that I now have the opportunity to live that great era of music for myself.  Yes, Jet does take their sound from the greatest rock bands that ever existed. That is not a bad thing.  The greatest thing about Jet is that they could care less how we review their debut album. They only care about the music. If that isn't true rock I don't know what is. And as a personal sidenote, anyone that can make you feel as though John Lennon and George Harrison came back to reunite with Paul and Ringo for one last great song is doing something very right. 'Look What You've Done' does just that.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Well, I own every single album Pat Metheny has ever put out. How does this one compare? It's definitely better than his last effort, \\"Speaking of Now\\" (2002), although not as ground-breaking as \\"Imaginary Day\\" (1997) (the other before that) or \\"We Live Here\\" (1995). However, it is a fresh sound and while no PMG album sounds exactly like any other, this is a worthy addition to your collection.
B000003TA4|5.0|What's there to say about \\"Nevermind\\"? It's the landmark album of the 90's; the album that changed music; etc. You know the drill. <br /> <br />Indeed, \\"Nevermind\\" is a stellar album. The best of the 90's? Not in my opinion. Most important? Yes. Overrated? No. Overplayed? Oh yeah. \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"Lithium\\", \\"Come As You Are\\", and \\"In Bloom\\" are all 90's rock anthems that still get heavy rotation today. <br /> <br />Even after you've heard 'em 100 times, you can still appreciate that they're incredibly well written songs. Butch Vig's production is very polished (which some people resent), giving nearly every song a radio-friendly sheen (as opposed to the lo-fi \\"Bleach\\"). Even \\"Breed\\" is so damn catchy that it overshadows how heavy it is.. <br /> <br />Other great songs that aren't played as much (if at all) include the accoustic \\"Polly\\", the artsier rock of \\"Drain You\\", the intense \\"Territorial Pissings\\" (which sounds like a precursor to their abrasive, anti-produced follow-up \\"In Utero\\"), the melodic pop of \\"On a Plain\\", the smooth-yet-jagged \\"Lounge Act\\", and the eerie closer \\"Something In the Way\\". <br /> <br />So yes, it's overplayed. Yes, it's not the most groundbreaking album (the soft/loud formula was done by The Pixies years before). But Kurt Cobain could write a the most rocking, coolest pop songs..and you gotta give him credit for that.  <br /> <br />If there's a downside to \\"Nevermind\\", it's that it influenced a lot of sub-par copycats who dominate the airwaves today. Still, it's an essential album. <br /> <br />Best Songs: Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You Are, Lithium, Drain You, Something In the Way, Lounge Act.  <br /> <br />
B00007LTIA|5.0|Chicks never like this album or \\"Relayer\\", both of which are my two favorites (in addition to CTtE of course). Not that most chicks like Yes anyways, but these two albums always seem to leave women just looking at us guys & wondering what we see that they don't. I think that \\"Relayer\\"'s Sci-Fi undertone explains some of the differences between the sexes preferences but I can't begin to explain why women always dis Tales? No answers here, just some observations...
B000003TAR|5.0|Not that \\"Nevermind\\" was quiet, but on \\"In Utero\\", Nirvana enlisted producer Steve Albini to give themselves a rough, more abrasive sound. Upon first listen, many of these songs border on unlistenable, and I think that was the point. I'm sure many of the casual fans tossed this noisy mess of an album aside whereas the more open minded fans listened again and again, only to discover that \\"In Utero\\" is even superior to its predecessor! <br /> <br />\\"Serve the Servants\\" (whose brilliant opening line is quoted in my title) starts things off pretty melodically, but then \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" kicks in, and you know this is a different animal from \\"Nevermind\\". Pounding drums, droning guitar feedback, blood curdling screams from Kurt, no hooks. \\"Milk It\\", \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\", and \\"Tourettes\\" follow a similar path. They're really incredible songs (well, \\"Tourettes\\" is kind of a throwaway), just not at first. <br /> <br />Not everything is like that. The omnious \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" contains one of Nirvana's most amazing hooks. It's so heavy..yet, so friggin catchy. \\"Rape Me\\" is soft/loud perfection, as is \\"Frances Farmer..\\" <br /> <br />The accoustic \\"Dumb\\" is as delicate and beautiful as any Nirvana song. Just heartbreakingly gorgeous. \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" is more soft/loud pop perfection. And of course, \\"All Apologies\\", Kurt's finest lyrical composition. This version is heavier, obviously, than the \\"MTV Unplugged\\" one (the latter of which is the more well-known, oft-heard version).  <br /> <br />It'll turn you off at first, but reward you later. Another landmark album from Nirvana. Unfortunately, their last. <br /> <br />Best Songs: Scentless Apprentice, All Apologies, Dumb, Milk It, Heart-Shaped Box, Rape Me.

B000148KK2|5.0|Brilliant!   <br /> <br />What more can you ask from Ms Krall.  After all these years of improvising on standards, she came up with this gem of an album.  The 12 songs starting from \\"Stop the World\\" and ending with \\"Departure Bay\\" is so varied in each of its texture and style.  This is the first of Diana's album where the word generic is absent from the description of her delivery. <br /> <br />One just need to listen to her rendition of Joni Mitchell's \\"Black Crow\\" to get a feeling of where the rest of \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\" is leading you to.  Her bluesy trademark is well represented on track number 6 \\"Love Me Like a Man\\".  These 2 selections are fine examples of Diana's diversity in style here. <br /> <br />\\"The Girl in the Other Room\\" is delightful and as stated by one of the reviewers this could really be Ms Krall's \\"Kind of Blue\\"!
B000056NX5|3.0|For what it was it was a pretty good remake of the 1973 classic. This movie was ment to show Jesus Christ Superstar would be like on the stage. It wasn't epic but it was still pretty enjoyable, until Jerome Pardon as Judas is on. Then its unlistonable. Don't get me wrong he acted really well. But he can't sing at all. He was god awful. I love JCS. But this updated remake is okay at best. Buy it if you are a diehard Superstar fan.
B0000508U6|4.0|Cold play is probably the best band out today, This band is better than maybe some of its influences such as radio head, the songs are all meaning full and are easliy related to, Martin singing style is outstanding and if anything gives and eiry resembles to rodger waters on the final cut and some of more haunting pink floyd songs, its to me the only music that honest and real today, this album is outstanding and is good to relax to definatly anyone who likes music and or is looking for something differnt or is interested in cold play but not sure about them should definatly consider this album and rush of blood to the head, cold play isn't a band thats generaly on the tv or on the radio as far as i know, but to me that means one thing, that means that there FREAKIN awsome.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Certainly, best Album of NW. Specially, \\" creek mary blood \\" wonderful song. All songs very beatiful and melodic. The Sound very clean  and this time more beat gitar riffs
B00008J4P5|4.0|This cd is an amazing expression of guitar abilities. Though the drumming is a little sketchy it goes good with the music. This cd is dark(7th nation army, the hardest button to button) and light(You've got her in your pocket) and the childish, it's true that we love one another. It's good, hopefully the white stripes keep making music.
B00008RH3L|4.0|After the phenomenal critical success of the Coen brothers creation \\"Barton Fink\\" a lot of their fans were intrigued by the story that the script for \\"Barton Fink\\" was based on the Coen's experiences making the film \\"Miller's Crossing.\\"  In \\"Barton Fink\\" a writer is lured to Hollywood to make a wrestling picture (an obvious parallel to the gangster genre).  He decides to write a unique wrestling picture with more intelligence and emotion and style than action sequences in the ring.   As with that scenario, \\"Miller's Crossing\\" is anything like typical gangster film noir.  It is loaded with memorable, quirky characters and finely tuned dialogue.   The cinematography is \\"handsome\\" and the acting is first rate.  The cast is exceptional.  Albert Finney, Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, and John Turturro lead the way with excellent performances but the rest of the cast frequently shine as well.  In \\"Barton Fink\\" the lead character struggles with writer's block, and there is a particular scene in \\"Miller's Crossing\\" that screams \\"Where does the script go from here?\\"  The final resolution to the dilema is original and highly intelligent.  The biggest problem with \\"Miller's Crossing\\" is that this style of filmmaking really isn't for everyone.  The Coen brothers are known for their eccentric perspective and for introducing a wide variety of personas into their often bizarre tales.  Other films of note that brought about equal parts praise and bewilderment are \\"Raising Arizona\\" and \\"Fargo.\\"  For what it's worth, anything original coming out of Hollywood is worth checking out.  \\"Miller's Crossing\\" is a well-made, cerebral gangster film filled with a carnival of characters and driven by a thoughtfully crafted screenplay.  It is hard to believe that both \\"Miller's Crossing\\" and Martin Scorsese's \\"Goodfellas\\" came out in the same year.  Both are gangster films, but both are completely different.  The special features on this DVD include an interesting featurette with Director ofPhotography Barry Sonnenfeld, and a short list of cast interviews that lasts about five minutes collectively.  If you happen to see \\"Barton Fink\\" and want to see where that story originated, then \\"Miller's Crossing\\" has most of the answers.  There is even an apartment building in \\"Miller's Crossing\\" called \\"The Barton Arms.\\"  \\"Miller's Crossing\\" is a good film that may be too unorthodox for some viewers, but is nonetheless one of the most unique gangster films ever made.  Recommended.
B00005ASHM|5.0|This album was originally released on and is still distributed by Capitol Records. Capitol's original catalog number is DT 2458 for the stereo LP and T 2458 for the mono LP. The stereo copies were \\"duophonic\\",meaning they could only be played on stereo phonographs for maximum sound quality. But then again,you'd get good quality sound if you played a duophonic copy on a monaural phonograph. Stereo LP copies of THE BEST OF THE BEACH BOYS were \\"duophonic\\" also. Hits from this album include SLOOP JOHN B.,GOD ONLY KNOWS and WOULDN'T IT BE NICE?. This album was a best-seller when it was released in 1966. The Beach Boys were still in their teen idol phase then as was their Capitol labelmates,The Beatles and Peter & Gordon. Also then,Brian Wilson began to have problems with drugs. He'd remain with the band in the studio but turned his duties on the stage to Bruce Johnston. All the other songs are good.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I bought this CD for the two Neil Young songs that get the most air time &quot;Hey Hey My My&quot; and &quot;Rockin' In the Free World&quot;.  I had not been exposed to any of the other material until I put this CD in my player.  What I discovered was a mixture of meaningful lyrics and unbelievable creativity that are no longer found on modern albums. The first two tracks blew me away because modern artists are incapable of writing songs that are longer than 4 minutes and 45 seconds. It has inspired me to look into other music of the 1960's and 1970's.  I am sure the long time fans of Neil Young will know of some tracks that should be here, they may be right as I do not know.  For people who don't know if they should buy this CD - Buy it.  People who download music suck.
B00006J3T4|5.0|I love this album, this is ofically one of Mark's best albums. <br />'COYOTE' rocks the hardest I can listen to overnover overnover <br />agian. GREAT for others like SHANGRI, and SAILING TO PHILADELPHIA. GREAT song. <br /> <br />
1586638491|5.0|This is a very simple review to write.  The book does what it promises.  Left hand page is the text of the play, to the right what each character says is given the literary equivalent of subtitles in colloquial english.<br /><br />For example, a character says about men in a shipwreck: \\"Not a hair perished.  On their sustaining garments not a blemish, but fresher than before.\\"<br /><br />Confused? Look to the translation on the opposing page: \\"Nobody was hurt in the slightest.  Even their clothes were unstained, and look fresher than before the storm.\\"<br /><br />Works better than a mere glossary because it puts the meaning of the characters' statements into 21st century English.  And Shakespeare is much more enjoyable and comprehensible when you know what is going on.
B00005JNEW|4.0|The overall message of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, that the most important drive in a person's life is to be 'perfect' - meaning true to one's self, always doing the best you can, being able to look your loved ones in the eye knowing you have done your best - is worth saying repeatedly.  When it comes from the mouth of Billy Bob Thornton playing the coach of a West Texas high school football team, it is eloquent.<br /><br />There is an honesty to this recreation of a true story as adapted by Peter Berg that rings true. Though the film is apparently about a football team's obsession with winning the Texas State Championship, it is more concerned with showing us the extremes such obsession drives small towns, parents, townsfolk, and even teammates into a variation of road rage.  Each of the teammates is examined and found to be the victim of too high expectations and distorted values.  It is the heart of the coach that ultimately puts winning and losing into perspective, and that moment in the locker room of the final game is superb.<br /><br />The cast is good, especially Billy Bob Thornton as the coach, but also his players Derek Luke, Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund, Jay Hernandez, Lee Jackson,  and Lee Thompson Young.  The direction is fine except for the ever-present level of noise from the sport and from the intrusive music, jerky editing, and jumbled views of the games in action.  Not a great movie, but a fine message delivered by some very fine actors.  Grady Harp, February 2005
B00063F8B2|4.0|I must say Polar Express was indeed a most wondrous movie. After watching the movie, I went to get the soundtrack the next day because the music was absolutely breathtaking. What especially stands out is \\"When Christmas Comes To Town\\", featuring a wonderful duet by 2 kids with voices that are very sweet. This song captures the mood of the movie and is simply incredible. \\"Believe\\" sung by Josh Groban is another marvellous song and I simply love it.<br /><br />My complaint though, is that on this cd, there are only 8 tracks which were composed for this movie. The other tracks are all from long ago and just doesn't make the cd worth it. The score by Alan Silvestri is wonderful but with the other half of the cd being old songs, I'm not sure if it is worth the price. But if you like Christmas music and like to have the feeling of Christmas, this is certainly the cd for you
B00003XACV|3.0|First off, I'll say that this is an excellent soundtrack with excellent music in it.  As a stand alone album, I would rate Thomas Newman's score with a 5/5 score.  However, as a movie score, it falls to an average rating.  Movie scores generally are supposed to have a bonding tone, theme and recognizable features to distinct the movie as it's own.  It has to give the movie identity.  However, American Beauty only consists of an array of almost completely unrelated cues which appear throughout, but don't connect with each other at all.  The point is that if you seperated some of these cues, then listened to them, you really wouldn't be able to tell that they are from the same score, except for the few duplicates. <br /> <br />However, this is an excellent music soundtrack.  Newman's use of percussion brings a bright feel to the music, especially when he brings out his mallet instruments.  And boy, there are a lot.  Although the constant use of the Vibraphone does get repetitive, it never really stops sounding good.  The first track \\"Dead Already\\", brings us a compilation of guitar, marimba/vibraphone and a slow piano interjection every now and then.  While it's one of the best tracks, it gets repetitive for long listening.  Lunch With The King is so good yet disappointing.  A comical and bright introduction is what starts it, before fading into a piano line repeated over and over with minor variations and repetition.   <br /> <br />The best track on the album, in my opinion, is \\"Weirdest Home Videos\\".  This may confuse some.  The track is neither a sad or happy track, those of which usually sound the best, instead it's a dark, unpleasant, and used to describe creepy ideas or actions.  After a short string-vibraphone introduction, the track plunges into it's hidden sinister section.  In fact, after the brief intro, all it really is a single line of vibraphone played over and over.  However, unlike Lunch With The King, the various instrumental interjections stand out,adding a texture to the vibraphone and adding a new layer each time, and a new sound.  Even though this track may sound like a repetition-bomb, I can surprisingly listen to this over and over and it always gets better. <br /> <br />The final noticeable tracks are \\"Any other name\\" and \\"American Beauty\\".  They both consist of generally the same thing, Newman's piano harmonics with strings and other textures overlapping and intricating within them.  The theme he creates for the tracks does sound good, and Any Other name has a seperate piano interjection at the end.  One more note should go to his tracks \\"Mental Boy\\" and \\"Angela Undress\\".  They hold a nice, gentle theme, but they are used so sparingly and with no variation that they don't matter much at all. <br /> <br />So while Newman does make some good music and themes for each track, they never bond or come together.  Instead of a common tone to identify the  movie with, he instead presents us with 19 bits of random underscore.  They all sound very good, but it fails as a movie score.  If this was a music compilation album, I would have given it 5 stars.
1591840562|4.0|Always been a big fan of Guy and his books.  He definitely \\"creates like a god,\\" \\"commands like a king,\\" and \\"works like a slave.\\" Readers who enjoyed this book will also enjoy a new book that came out after Guy's book, called \\"It's not about the technology\\" by Raj Karamchedu.  Karamchedu's book talks about the what happens after you indeed do start and how startup companies degenerate.  The book's entire focus is on the dysfunction that sets when marketers and engineers don't interact well.  I\\"ve read the book and can't stop recommending it to this group of readers.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Simpliy put WOW. To start with Gimme Shelter sends chills. Dark and intellegent one of their best
B0002EXH4A|5.0|This album first came out in 1988.  Back then, I couldn't wait until 1999, the year Dave Mustaine predicted in the 2nd song that 'distorted figures' would be walking the streets.  Back then, I thought that would be hella cool. What I didn't know was that Mustaine was X-tremely high at the time. Anyways 1999 rolled around and nothing happened. When 1999 finally ended and Y2K hit, still nothing happened.  Oh well, aside from my childhood dreams being shattered, this album is still very cool. This album is my 2nd fave., behind Rust in Peace (3rd is Peace Sells). So this review may apply more to those who like classic Mustaine. <br /> <br />This album has it all. Crushing riffs (Set the World Afire, Hook in Mouth), killer intro (Lungs of Hell), excellent lyrics (Liar), tons o emotion (MJ, Darkest Hour), who cares album title, etc.. Although nobody cares today, this album was so \\"in your face\\" at the time, you had to listen to it 10 hrs a day, even though the album was less than 30 minutes long.  Some miscellaneous comments: <br /> <br />\\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\", although punk purists may not enjoy, is a great metal version of the song. It's definitely better than the Motley Crue version. F'in destroyyyyyy. <br /> <br />I think \\"502\\" is outdated (in addition to the '1999'reference), at least it is in California. The song should be titled \\"23152 (a) and (b)\\" here instead. Nevertheless, this song 'makes you feel good' while driving fast (only drink if it 100% safe). The best lyrics on the album are on this song ..\\"Pull over s.h... this is the coppppssss!!!\\" <br /> <br />Some negligible setbacks:  The remastered album does not provide too much in special features (sorry this ain't no dvd).  Some production notes. A coupla sound effects here and there. The 4 remixes sound almost exactly the same as the originals. No ones going to say one version was more awesome than the other. Who cares though? You get 12 songs!!!
B000000W5L|5.0|Exile is one of those albums (yes I said albums) that carries the test of time. From start to finish it carries it self with out help from other Stones albums. If you never heard of the Stones (yeah right) This is one I would pull out to let you listen to to get the feel of Shine a Light, Tumbling Dice, Sweet Black Angel and more.
0767834739|5.0|It's not like you won't have a clue if you don't see the first movie but if your a major movie buff and and need to know the in's and out's then watch it! <br /> <br />This movie was a great second to the first. It continued where the first movie left off and kept Milla Jovavich in it which was an added bonus. <br /> <br />It may be somewhat different than the video games but the storyline in the movie was put together very nicely. Definitely a change in pace from the first movie whereas almost everybody dies and now most of them survive. Yet, don't get me wrong. Not everyone makes it out alive or is able to resist the T-virus mutation. <br /> <br />The zombies in this movie were excellant as well. They had a eerieness to them being shot in slow motion (in the beginning) and looked very realistic. As realistic as one would imagine a zombie to be. And, beeing a fan of die hard Horror movies, I have to say that these zombies get 2 thumbs up from me! The director didn't focus too much on them so as not to make this appear as another \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" movie. He kept up with them and the story line which was great. <br /> <br />I admit, when I first seen Nemisis I was a bit taken back. I couldn't help but thinking the whole movie had just gone down the toilet with an oversize monster. But, having faith in the first Resident Evil and watching on I was quite surprised to see how well they integrated him into the sequel. It was better than to be expected. <br /> <br />If you love science fiction, horror, and the unknown testing of viral weaponry (or however you spell it) and all of those hidden government labs which claim to not be doing what they are doing, then you will love this move and the first one as well. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps your interest up the very last minute, leaving you hungry for more! <br />
B00005JN4O|5.0|this was a very very good movie. the wife and i went yesterday afternoon to see this great movie. i have always liked johnny depp in what ever he played in. this is a great story of friendship one of the most touching i have ever seen. the little boys in this movie were all great but freddie highmore is one the best little actors i have ever seen. this movie will touch your heart  and break it. i was setting 3 or 4 times with a tear rolling down my face but this show had such a ending the wife and i both had a river of tears flowing down our faces. this is a great date movie guys dont be afraid to take wife or girlfriend to see it and open up your heart and mind when you do you will have a great time of crying and laughing together like the wife and i did.

B000089CJI|3.0|Well I received this CD as a present and I was greatly excited. I had heard some really great things about it and had known the song \\"Such great heights\\" for some time. Well I wasn't too disappointed. I think musically this is really strong. Great loops and beats, etc, etc. The lyrics have that nice nostalgic teenage romance thing going for them, but not in an overly cheesy way. The one thing that really grates me about this album though, is the vocals. Something about Gibbard's voice, to me, is like someone scratching their nails on a blackboard. Other than that...pretty decent pop album.
B0002OERI0|1.0|green day has stopped playing their music and has sold out to what is \\"popular\\" and what the music industry wants them to play. this album is very poppy and trendy which is not what green day used to be. if you want to listen to their good music listen to dookie or warning, but please, not this. they used to be one of my favorite bands but after i saw them with eye makeup, black clothing attire, and playing some of the most cheesy music i've heard, i changed my mind. the last thing we need is another pop/rock band wearing eye make-up polluting the airwaves. long live the old green day
1400034205|4.0|This book could have done with some more discussion of Larry's time in India.  In fact, very little of the book has to do with that.  Most of it has to do with a character being snubbed or accepted to parties.  But it's still a good book and worth reading if you like the subject matter.
B0000047EC|5.0|Not much to say. The harmonies, the playing, the mood, the music. All good and beautiful. way 5 stars!
B00009RAJJ|5.0|Wow!! This is an awesome, beautiful album. The second disc is worth twice the price. I remember all the criticism about this album when it came out. Everyone compared it Rumors which had been the number one album in the country for 52 weeks. No other album before or since has been number one for as long a time, so can you really compare anything to Rumors? I don't think so.    In my opinion, Tusk was a landmark album, one that only comes about every once in a while. It had the power to change the way we listen to music. Like many people, when it came out, I did not like any of the songs. Well, that's not exactly true since I was one of the members of the USC Trojan Marching Band that recorded Tusk with the band. I even got to play five nights at the Forum in LA on the Tusk Tour. But even though I was that into the album, I still didn't like the music. It was difficult to listen to. It wasn't what I was used to listening to.    On top of all that, it was an expensive album with two twelve inch discs, yes, before CDs. It was competing with the past success of Rumors and with the Eagles Hotel California which was just a single album. Lots of people considered Tusk to be a failure.    Because I was on the album, I played it from beginning to end over and over. It took me about three months before I realized that I was beginning to like the songs, then I started to really love the songs. That's the first time I understood the concept of \\"ground breaking\\" music. Fleetwood Mac had not just given us more of the same, which they could have done and we all would have loved it. They had given us something that had never existed before, which is why it was difficult to listen to at first. We'd never heard anything like it before. It was different. We couldn't instantly like it. We had to grow. Our ears had to change. It evolved us, and there was no going back.    If you've never listened to Tusk, I hope you give it a try. If you're a fan of Tusk, I hope you buy this new versionand listen to the second disc which contains new versions of the old songs. It's hard to believe that this album is 26 years old. I've definitely crossed over to being an old timer, because it seems like yesterday that I was first listening to these songs. Thank you Fleetwood Mac.
B0006M4SO6|2.0|What can I say. I'm a big fan of Metheny's guitar...But this album really shows who he is musically. He's a master guitar player, with beautiful phrases, tone, experiments, etc... But here is a question to Pat: Where is the music? The music that touches people's hearts? Why changing keys with no point to it? Or why using harmonies filled with holes and emptiness? Is it just fun with the math? If so, this is not about music, this is about research and science. But to add to it, it's not even interesting... It's a boring math, nothing that sparks an excitement. Music is the truth, you either reach it or you don't. It exists regardless how and what methods we're trying to research it with. So, unfortunately this album did not any touch with the real. It's probably the most artificial of his career, in the full meaning of \\"art\\" as not natural...I'm giving 2 stars because it's Metheny, but that's it... <br /> <br />I know he can do much better, connect through your heart, Pat!
B000002GFC|5.0|as a rule, most compilations are not all that great. usually one or maybe two songs get left off. or they just don't fill up a whole disc. but for the most part, this compilation has just about all of what you could want in a best of collection. now me, being a drummer, i would have also included.. yep, you guessed it.. TOAD. but, that's just a minor infracture to this great collection. cream only put out 4 studio albums and 2 vol's of live albums so really, by buying this instead of the actual albums, you're not really missing out on a whole lot. unless you're a completeist and just want the actual albums. the thing with this collection is, you get the songs that we're released as singles only like, anyone for tennis and wrapping paper which are not on the regular albums. all in all, for someone who just wants a single disc collection only, this is truly the way to go. you may not be one to put cream in your coffee, but be sure too put some cream in your music collection, great music from a great rock 'n roll band, get creamed today.
0375758992|4.0|This novel shows Alexandra Fuller's power to realistically and in a child-like way unveil her childhood. She was brought up impoverished in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Africa. The family has moved there because of the beginning of war in the early 1970's. Alexandra's family lived in fear of the war and due to that they slept, feeling protected, with gun under their pillows. The families tragedies occur when three out of the five children die at young ages. All of her troubles as a child lead to her confusions in adolescence. Living during that time we see the struggles that white Africans and black Africans encountered. Fuller shows her life, struggle, and compassion for her country like no other.  <br /> I would definitely recommend this book because it shows the essential root and authenticity of life. There is violence, there is corruption, there is racism, but there also is consideration and breakthrough. True evidence of growth emotionally and spiritually. I believe this book will appeal to anyone willing to pick it up. Anyone who is eager to go deep inside the heart of a child and woman in extremely difficult times her life will undoubtedly be able to expeience that with this novel. There are not many books that can open someone's eyes, but if truth is what the reader seeks, then this is the book to lay it out.

B00003CXC7|5.0|\\"Here lie the broken bones of L.B. Jeffries.\\"  That's what's been written on the plaster cast on the aforementioned Jeffries, an ace photographer who's been in a wheelchair for seven weeks because he got too close during a race car match.<br /><br />Jeffries is bored and listless, but at least his days in limbo gives him a view of life's passing parade through his binoculars, namely the other tenants whom he can see through his window.  The show's starring attraction is Miss Torso, a blonde buxom ballet dancer who can be seen shaking her thing and wearing nice pink bikinis-Jeffries expression on seeing her is priceless.  (Yes, she is nice, isn't she?) The songwriter who's lost his muse, a pair of newlyweds, a couple with a dog who fight the hot summer heat by sleeping on their balcony, and Miss Lonelyheart, a single woman who undergoes the being single blues.  However, during a particularly sleepless night, he notices how Mr. Thorvald, a jewelry salesman with an invalid wife, goes in and out of his apartment three times during the late hours, returning once with a large saw.  Why hasn't he been in his wife's bedroom all day?  \\"Something's terribly wrong,\\" he surmises.<br /><br />Jeffries is also going through a bit of a crisis with his girlfriend Lisa Freemont, and they are quite a pair.  He's more a rough action-type of guy, having served in the war, going on tough assignments on one suitcase, entering tough situations, while she's \\"too perfect,\\" having that chic, ultrasophisticated, rarified Park Avenue ambience, never wearing the same dress twice.  Jeffries is thinking that he wants someone too ordinary, someone who can bear up to his way of life if she wants to come along.  He's the old-fashioned type who thinks that \\"nothing has caused the world more trouble than intelligence,\\" and goes on to discuss how psychoanalysis and interpretation of different emotional levels as examples.<br /><br />It takes the goings-on of the Thorwald apartment to draw the strained couple together, as Lisa uses her feminine intuition to realize that indeed a woman wouldn't leave such an expensive handbag, jewelry, and her wedding ring behind if she was going to leave on a long trip.  However, feminine intuition and Jeffries' speculations don't convince his war buddy and now detective Tom Doyle, who does some digging around to humor Jeffries and finds out the wife isn't dead.

B00004XQJX|5.0|I'm sure this recording will serve as another document in the Great Pollini Debate (one of the greatest pianists of all time or \\"mere mechanicus,\\" as Mozart put it?).  As one who's been on the \\"anti-Pollini\\" side, let me say at once that this is one of the greatest performances of the Diabelli Variations I've ever heard.  What impresses first of all is the clarity and power of Pollini's playing--for example the left hand in 16 and the right hand in 17, the miraculous articulation of the right hand triplets in 7 and the left hand runs in 25.  But Pollini is also capable of great tenderness--the flowing simplicity of the fughetta (24) and the beautiful balancing of chords in 20 and 29.  Best of all are the last three variations: the dignity of 31, the bracing and energetic (but not hectic) fugue, and the delicacy of 33 (Maurizio, you ol' charmer!).  Recorded sound is not exactly sensuous, but it fits Pollini's playing to a T.  The only down side is Pollini's singing, which is becoming more intrusive with time.  The odd thing about his singing is that it's most intrusive in loud passages (6, 9, the loud chords in 17).  I imagine he thinks we can't hear him when the music's loud.  Perhaps some producer ought to say, \\"MAURIZIO, WILL YOU JUST SHUT THE HELL UP!\\"  But honestly this is a minor porblem in just a few variations.  All told, this great performance belongs in the collection of every Diabelli lover.
B0001LYH9S|2.0|Why did he release it? I know some people who say \\"it's great\\", but I prefer his songs with a bit of a tune instead of just creating a racket. I don't want to sound like an idiot who doesn't know what he's talking about, but listen to his other albums. They are so much better than this! The best thing Bowie did for this album was to give 'Hallo Spaceboy' to the Pet Shop Boys, have them remix it, and give himself a Top 20 hit. <br />The little segments of dialogue he has created are useless. They don't seem to get anywhere. Besides 'Hallo Spaceboy', the only other decent track is 'Stranger When We Meet'. <br />If you are wondering whether or not to buy it.... don't waste your money! I chose this over 'Black Tie White Noise' and I've regretted it ever since!
0385510454|1.0|A copy of a guidebook to Bologna and first year Italian lessons.  Then directions on how to escape Bologna by bus, cab, train, plane.  And if you didn't get the directions the first time, it's repeated.  I'm not sure the pace ever picked up.  Not up to expectations for a good Grisham read.  If you must read it, borrow it from the library or some pathetic friend who shelled out the full price at local bookstore.
B0002234LS|5.0|I loved this movie. Watch the Making part on the dvd after you watch it and then watch it a secod time. It is cool the effects they used to show reality.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|I enjoyed the movie when it came out in theaters and its not so bad like everyone seems to think. <br />I think its a good sit down and have fun type of film to watch. <br />One error mind you, it's only a 1 disc special edition, not 2 disc as listed. <br />Anyhow........enjoy it!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I have never seen a love story that was the inspiring story the way this is. From being so happy to being so sad this movie has it all and is like magic life.
B00004RF9B|5.0|My favorite sci-fi movie period is the 1950's and this movie is at the top my list. In fact the first dvd I bought was this movie. I have seen it 20-25 times over my life and still it rocks. Considering it came out in 1956 the special effects are top notch and with an excellant plot this movie is defintely a sci-fi classic. Sure it has a few weak spots but seeing that invisible id monster suddenly appearing in the force field and grabbing crewman like ragdolls is the real highlight of the movie. Sometimes I wonder why they didn't make a sequel, backtracking when the original expedition first landed on the planet and what developed into an ultimate survivor match. \\"Monsters John...monsters from the id!\\".
B00000IOSU|4.0|Who said that it was live? Is it written somewhere? No! I'va bought this cd and i listen to the first song and said maybe other songs are not live but THE WHOLE CD IS LIVE! I am lucky that i love A LOT sarah mclachlan's music because i would be disapointed... but even if its live, sarah mclachlan music is soooooooo good that we forget the fans behind. but i think that she should do a greatest hits album but not live. it would be so amazing!
B000002U82|5.0|After \\"finding their sound\\" in a way with \\"Echoes\\", the greatest song of all time, and taking a few dry runs at the songs on this album on the great \\"Obscured By Clouds\\"(Childhood's End - Time, Mudmen - Any Colour You Like,), Pink Floyd was finally ready to craft their greatest album.    1. Speak To Me/Breathe - (10/10) A great opener to a phenomenal album. Outstanding lyrics and singing. This is not counting \\"Speak To Me\\" which is basically some clips from the other songs on the album and a few other things.    2. On The Run - (8.5/10) An interesting organ driven instrumental.    3. Time - (10/10) One of Floyd's most well-known songs and most-liked songs. I'm not sure what I like better: Gilmour's awesome vocals(one of his best performances), Gilmour's awesome guitar solo(one of the greatest in rock history), or the awesome lyrics....I'll go with the guitar solo.    4. The Great Gig In The Sky - (4.5/10) \\"...\\" is all I have to say. It's essentially what sounds like a fat african-american woman screaming for 4 and a half minutes.     5. Money - (10/10) Another one of Floyd's most famous, though it's not all that well-liked by most fans. I'm not sure why, because this song is excellent. Great intro, great lyrics, great vocals, great jazzi-ness, and great guitar and sax solos.    6. Us & Them - (10/10) An often overlooked gem, and one of the highlights of this album. Very \\"powerful\\" song with great singing and lyrics.    7. Any Colour You Like - (10/10) A nice little psychedelic instrumental.    8. Brain Damage - (10/10) Some of Water's greatest lyrics, and that's saying a lot.    9. Eclipse - (10/10) An excellent closer...not much more to say.    Pink Floyd's best album and one of the best of all time.
B00028HBKM|3.0|Ok, so supposedly the Anti-Defamation League has its panties in a bunch because of this film. True, the Pharisees were portrayed as being pretty ruthless in their insistence that Jesus be crucified. And their cruelty seemed to stem from superstition and fear; which is not particularly flattering. Jesus' buddy Peter, also Jewish, turned his back on him when he needed him most. Jesus' Jewish mom and other male friend (some apostle) just stood around and shook their heads as he was tortured for an inordinate amount of screen time. And we all know about Judas. So yeah, the Jews (except Jesus) in the film aren't portrayed in the kindest of lights.<br /><br />But it's not Fiddler on the Roof. It's a story of a man (divine or otherwise) put to an excruciating and drawn out death because of intolerance and fear. Seems like something the ADL could relate to. But from their reaction one would think that no Jew is allowed to be portrayed as anybody but a lovable comic or respectable holocaust survivor.<br /><br />Besides, the Romans in this movie were far FAR worse. The degree of sadism by which the soldiers carry out their orders is stomach turning beyond anything that could be deemed \\"unfavorable.\\" It's the Italians who should be up in arms.<br /><br />All this, I suppose, is beside the point of a review. The movie is inspiring. It is very emotional. It is excessively violent. And it is drawn out. The story is essentially the slow agonizing demise of Jesus.  One would have to be a bit of a sadist to purchase the DVD for multiple viewings. The film dwells more on the gore than the triumphs or teachings of Jesus. I'm sure Mel \\"Mad Max\\" Gibson thought that by making it really graphic and disgusting he could play up the sacrifice that JC made for all of us sinners. But after a while it falls flat and Jesus becomes somewhat of a punching bag.<br /><br />Also, should Jesus and Mary have been white?  One would have to believe they'd be a least little tan. I mean, if the tearing of the flesh is going to be ultra-realistic, shouldn't the flesh itself be as well?<br /><br />Christian or not, it's an interesting take on a story that has had an monumental effect on the world today. But I believe the film's message becomes obscured by the violence used to convey it. I don't say this because I can't watch violence. I'm a huge \\"Road Warrior\\" fan. But come on.<br /><br />PS: The creepy hooded pastey-faced guy with the munchkins...I think that's the devil.g to be ultra-realistic, shouldn't the flesh itself be as well? <br />Christian or not, it's an interesting take on a story that has had an monumental effect on the world today.

0345446798|5.0|If you ask 100 dog trainers to agree on something, they will agree on one thing: that it is always more difficult to train the dog's owner than to train the dog! <br /> <br />I just finished reading \\"The Other End Of The Leash\\" and I have to say this is one of the best dog training books every written. Why? Because it is a book that trains the *reader*!  <br /> <br />The purpose of \\"The Other End Of The Leash\\" is to facilitate communication between humans and their best friends. Patricia has studied animal communication for years and in this book you will find her personal experiences paired with lots of helpful advice. We are taken on a journey, and we study both primates and canines. At the end, we are left with a much clearer picture of how our dogs see us. By becoming aware of the different habits of primates and canines, we realise lots of things: For example, it's not the dogs fault if he runs away from a human that is walking head-on towards him. For a primate this is a perfectly normal way to greet someone, but for a dog a head-on approach means attack. This is the most simple example of what you will find in this book.  <br />Patricia McConnell's way of writing is simply magnificent as well. By the end of the book I felt like I had personally met her  three Border Collies and Tulip. More than once I had to stop reading for a few minutes because I had tears in my eyes.   <br /> <br />Patricia helps us become better dog owners. By making us more aware of our moves, she helps us realise how to bridge the gaps between the human world and the canine world. After reading this book you will understand so much more about how your dog behaves, that it feels like taking a blindfold off!  <br /> <br />In conclusion: this is a book that should be in every dog-lover's library!
B0006Z2LCE|4.0|I'm still trying to figure out what it means \\"single version\\" of aome of theses songs, because my single versions were much shorter and are not available on any CD in the world. You can find these single versions on any and all Donna Summer CD collections. So THAT marketing technique failed for me. The only thing different on here was the Edit version of last years hit You're So Beautiful which was otherwise available in a very long 11 minute version. While there is NO Donna Summer collection that actually has all of her single versions included, this one has 2 volumes of hits in chronlogical order.<br /><br />  The first disc includes her most popular 70's classics, excluding Winter Melody, Summer Fever, I Remember Yesterday, Theme From The Deep, Once Upon A Time, Rumour Has It, With Your Love (B-side for Last Dance), Walk Away, Our Love, On My Honour and My Baby Understands. The second disc spans from 1980-2004. The Wanderer was her first recording for the Geffen label and change in musical direction. Her recordings were sparadicallly successfull partially because of acusations that she was anti-gay and her new found Christianity. Donna always loved her gay following and STILL does.<br /><br />  Other highlights from the 80's on missing here are Who Do You Think You're Foolin', Cold Love, Romeo (from Flashdance), The Woman In Me, Sometimes Like Butterflies (B-side Love Is In Control), Love Has a Mind Of It's Own, Face The Music (B-side There Goes My Baby), Only The Fool Survive, Tearin' Down The Walls (B-side Dinner With Gershwin), Breakaway and Ordinary Miracle. did I also forget tomention Love Is A Healer And The Power Of One?  OK I think I made my point, ie you can't fool a DS fan with repacked stuff when there is so much unavailable!<br /><br />At least shorten the single versions by using the short original 45 versions so you can put the little hits too! I'll buy it!
0375703764|3.0|This book is quite good. I don't want to attack it because i applaud the fact that the writer has tried to break away from the conservative and conventional novel structure that most writers still employ. It is ambitious and unusual and makes a nice change from run of the mill novels. On the other hand the characters are a little chliched and undeveloped and the prose is a little clumsy. Sometimes writers get so caught up in textual experimentation that they forget, or don't have the energy to take care with the prose. If you enjoy the textual experiments and the parody of academia in this novel, you might also enjoy reading 'The Third Policeman' by Flann O'brien. He was pushing the limits of postmodernism even before Borges. He is also a master of prose and a comic genius.
B00005JNEI|1.0|For those of you not too informed about politics, let me start by saying this movie is one big fabrication.  Michael Moore is a liar.  Plain and simple.  There is no other way to describe him.  Please do not be fooled by his blatently ignorant misrepresentation of our great country.  I cant think of one part of the film that was actually true.  His mocking of 9/11 and our men and women in uniform is disgusting and disrespectful.  I urge anyone not enlightened into the whole political scene to not watch this movie, as it will give you the absolute wrong idea about our soldiers, our country, and our great leader George W Bush.  If you are in the know about politics, and can sit through 2 hours of BS, go for it.  You wont be impressed.

B000268QB2|5.0|When I first heard the band Keane, my ears welcomed the smooth flow of piano and unbelieveable vocals.  If you like Coldplay, you'll definately love this band.  From the sound of them, they will be around for more than one album.  They made a awesome entrance to the music world with the appearence of HOPES & FEARS.  Their music calms the soul, and relaxes the mind, and they did it in an undepressing manner.  5 Stars all the way and im already excited for what else they have to come.
0156027321|1.0|A otherwise small and eventually engaging little tale that is contaminated by the grimy sludge of smug spirtuality.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|After watching this it gave me a sense why the last album, ST. Anger, can't seem to get past 3 stars. Their worst album to date.  I liked the idea that Lars at least talks to Dave Mustane about the break up, i've had alot of resentment for Metallica over Napster and the way Dave was treated!! I hope they can get it together and put  together  a break through album next time around! I don't see what they saw in the bassist the hired from Ozzy's band, and a strange looking addition the way he plays the base.
B00013F35I|5.0|I don't know what all this is about the sound quality being poor on this DVD, but this is the best concert DVD I have, from Bruce or any other artist, and the reason, beyond the fact that Bruce is one of the best, if not the best, performers still showin' us how it's done, is the awesome sound quality.  It is so good I burned a audio CD and listen to it all the time.  For my money Bruce's songs generally sound better live than in the studio recordings - they benefit so much from having that live energy -so having a great setlist like this to listen to is like a dream come true.       It's over a year later and I still pop this in just to listen to it.  And then I'll peek in at the picture and I'm trapped!  Whatever I'm doing I stop and watch this thing I've seen a hundred times and still pulls me in!  I love this concert!    So how can some reviewers here say the sound is great and others say its so bad that its not worth having?  I have two theories:  There are some lower quality prints circulating and/or some people have burned copies of this - not the real thing. The only other thing I can think of is that these people so down on this haven't actually seen this DVD.  If I'm wrong about that than the only explination I can fathom is my first suspicion that there are some crap copies out there, because mine rocks!  Maybe its time for a new TV and some surround sound.    My other beef with some of the reviews I'm seeing here are coments like Bruce looks old, tired, fat and sounds that way too.  Again, I don't know what concert you guys are watching!  As with the sound quality issue, I had the exact opposite reaction.  The first time I watched this all I could think was how fit the Boss is for his age, how much energy he poured out for over 2 and a half straight hours and how I hope I look that good in 25-30 years!  So again, did you people actually see this?!?!?!    People have watched this with me - even non-Bruce fans - and have been blown away; mezmerized by theperformance!  So this is not just me wanting to like this DVD.    I have to give props to three other critics who reviewed this DVD here at Amazon; one who says this is what it is like to be at a Bruce stadium show, and like being right there in Barcelona for this one, another calls it, \\"absolutly incredible,\\" saying her 13-monh-old is addicted to it (I'm telling you, no one can tear their eyes away from this performance once they start watching it; it's great to hear Bruce can and will touch a whole new generation of fans - I hope when I have a kid they will feel the same), and lastly, the writer who calls this DVD \\"Simly the Best... 5 stars and more.\\"  I couldn't agree with all of you more.  Interestingly, all of these reviewers testify the DVD has incredible sound and production values.  Why others don't is a mystery, but it is a shame they are making posible buyers wary of this product.  All I can say is make sure you buy the real thing and check the sound options on your TV and/or surround sound.    As for the highlights:  \\"Mary's Place\\" is a high-energy kick.  \\"Dancin' In the Dark's\\" live treatment bests the synthed-up album version, as does the throbbing, more guitar driven \\"Born In the USA\\" (I don't know how anyone can watch him blaze though this tune and say he looks anywhere near old or tired), \\"Ramrod\\" here becomes a classic because the whole band infuses a goofy energy and Bruce's piano spots work on a whole other emotional level.  Also, this is the only place to see a full, uncut concert (it comes close to the performance I saw last year at Miller Park, but closer to the arena show I saw a year earlier; either way, its like being back there again), get great live performances from \\"The Rising,\\" and see hits not included on the New York DVD, like \\"The Promised Land,\\" She's the One,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Dancin' In the Dark\\" and full-on-electric \\"U.S.A.,\\" all of which are incredible!  I can not say enough abouth this DVD!    I feel sorry for those whocouldn't enjoy this because of their goofy hang-ups.  Get your eyes and ears checked! Everyone else, get this DVD!
B000066744|4.0|A gem!  Enchanting.  Loved the story, acting & the MUSIC. Well worth watching more than once. Close to 5 stars. The demolition scene will ROCK your subwoofer!  Tim Roth's performance is top knotch.  Buy the CD soundtrack & DVD for added enjoyment.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|I could go on and on about Springsteen for pages, but this collection is fairly easy to review.  \\"Essential' does everything right that \\"Greatest Hits\\" did wrong, while still managing to miss a few necessities.  I had been smacking my head in disbelief for a long time at how Columbia can keep releasing Essential collections from even their most minimalist artists and we still didn't a definative Bruce collection, so when I heard they were finally releasing this - and it would be three discs long - I was salivating.      So, here it is at last!     We all knew it would put the sloppy and under-nurished \\"Greatest Hits\\" to shame  but what I didn't count on was that disc 3 would be all rarities.  DON'T GET ME WRONG, I like that disc and I'm all for having most of Bruce's rarities on a nicely mastered recording, but I'm more for having the definative hits/fan favorites set.  If we are still going to be left without \\"Growin' Up,\\" \\"Hard to Be A Saint...,\\" \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,\\" \\"Backstreets,\\" \\"Kitty's Back,\\" \\"She's the One,\\" \\"Prove It All Night,\\" \\"Racing In the Street,\\" \\"Out In the Street,\\" \\"Cadillac Ranch,\\" \\"I'm A Rocker,\\" \\"Cover Me,\\" \\"I'm On Fire,\\" \\"I'm Goin' Down,\\" \\"Bobby Jean,\\" \\"Tougher Than the Rest,\\" \\"One Step Up,\\" \\"Better Days,\\" and at least three other deserving tracks from \\"The Rising,\\" then it is something of a slap in the face to have a third cd that could have eassily accomidated those songs and made this collection perhaps everything we were all hoping for, consumed by the least essential thing to any artist - rarities.  RARITIES - That very name deems them UNESSENTIAL.      So its not three discs of hits, but the two discs do a pretty decent job of sellecting, I guess what you'd call, the major-most highlights of Springsteens career, but it is shy of being essential.    (Two of the biggest wrongs from \\"Greatest Hits\\" are corrected, at least in terms of tracks that should never be left off any Springsteen hits compilation and songs even non-Bruce fans haveprobably heard umpteen times blasting from the radio:  \\"Rosalita\\" and \\"The Promissed Land,\\" but by those same standards they still miss two others, again that even the uninitiated might be asking where they are:  \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\\" and \\"I'm On Fire.\\"  Even if you disagree as to wether these are classic Springsteen songs, they are recognizable enough that it would seem a no brainer that they be included among his \\"hits.\\" Again, if we were talking about personal and die-hard fan favorites I'd be mentioning \\"Backstreets,\\" \\"Prove It All Night,\\" \\"Adam Raised A Cain,\\" etc. again; but in terms of pure essentials, radio hits, what-have-you; those two songs should have made the cut.)    What is also a little disapointing is there isn't much imagination in the selections.  How about including some of the tracks that Springsteen made hits for other artists like \\"Fire,\\" and \\"Because the Night.\\"  The Springsteen versions are seldom heard on radio, but are fan favorites and Bruce plays them often on tour.  To that degree it might have been fun to include (live, or any version of) \\"Red Headed Woman;\\" and how about the piano-and-Bruce-only version of \\"Spirit In the Night\\" from Barcelona, which turned up as a B-Side on the \\"Lonesome Day\\" single? This performance completely reinvents that song, the audience participation (\\"ALL NIGHT!\\") drives the whole thing home, and even though Bruce flubs a line in the last verse, that only makes the whole thing more endearing. \\"Pink Cadillac\\" was a hit but homeless until it finaly showed up on \\"Tracks;\\" but putting it on this collection would have made a lot of people happy.  All of these tracks would be appropriate on the rarities disc, if not mixed in with the true essentials.  Personaly I love \\"Worlds Apart,\\" but if you just want to be technical about it, \\"The Rising\\" had two other singles (\\"Waiting On a Suny Day\\" and \\"My City of Ruins\\" - or how about the 9/11 tribute version for variety - again something that would be nice for fans who didn't pony up for that compilation but would like to have this one song),although Bruce does address in the liner notes there will be songs that probably should have made the cut, but couldn't.  Perfectly understandable given the amount of great material, but agian, if a whole disc is going to be contributed to rarities instead genuine classics... well, you know...    Well, shoulda, woulda, coulda... It's possible hardcore fans of any artist can never be satisfied when it comes to things like this, so for the uninitiated this will probably do the trick (while their hardcore fan friend stands around telling them that they also need this song and that song and this other song too).  I would be 100 times more comfortable giving this to someone I wanted to introduce to the Boss than \\"Greatest Hits,\\" but I wouldn't feel the intro. was complete.    All that said, I love the songs that are here, love the remastered sound.  I just wish there were more of them.  I'm still giving this collection 5 stars because the material that is here is 5-star quality and because of the Springsteen collections available it is far and away the best.
B0002234LS|5.0|This is probably the best Johnny Depp performance since Edward Scissorhands. I admit he's been stuck with some weird characters, nothing changes for this performance. This movie is well worth the time watching it. I don't see how anyone don't like this movie. I rented it first, when I carried it back I immediatley bought it for 20$ WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!
B00000JLWW|1.0|alright, let's get the basics outta the way. While the special effects and disaster scenes deserved all the credit it got, this movie sucks.  it's supposed to be a great love story, yet it's about a future wife committing adultry with a bum.  plus it had a bad script.  hell, i believed Total Recall had better acting and a better script than this.  if you want a good and/or historically correct movie, consider watching these: Saving Private Ryan, The Shawshank Redemption, The Untouchables, hell, watch Superman. that's probably more likely to happen than in this crap that evidentally deserves 11 academy awards.  If you want a real movie worthy of that much oscars, watch one of the best movies ever: Ben-Hur
0375703861|5.0|Archie Jones and the rest of the crazy cast of this madcap novel are REAL, which is to say so idiosyncratic, so weird, so messed up, that it sometimes seems impossible that they were imagined by any writer, much less a writer still young enough to be in college.  True, that college happened to be Oxford, and that writer happened to be (become?) Zadie Smith, brilliant, wunderkind, lovely.  The sheer scope of this novel, its breadth, its ambition, takes us from the undignified battlefront of WWII reminiscent of Catch-22, to a revolution in Bangladesh, to the grimy, rough and tough streets of working class London in the Seventies like something in the backgound of a music video for The Clash, to the present... and beyond, to that rare place: literary transcendence.  Smith accomplishes all that with a disarming confidence and grace; she seems all-knowing and all-powerful where her characters are blind and clumsy; it is this potent mix, the beauty drawn out of the ugly, the brutality of life distilled into haunting, melodic, and ultimately warming prose, that will leave Smith's reader intoxicated by her genius. <br /> <br />White Teeth is not perfect, and the ending is lacking the confidence of the other parts, but it is so brilliant most of the way that when you come to an imperfection your eyes are blinded enough so as not to notice.  It is, in the end, a perfect reading experience, one I'd gladly dive into again.
B00005JLXE|5.0|Daredevil struck me as an ejoyable movie that got chopped down so they could get in more showings over it's opening weekend and make it a PG-13. I didn't mind and found it to still be entertaining if not completely what I wanted. The Kingpin seemed far less impressive than I had hoped for and that was that...or so it seemed. While watching the theatrical cut on DVD I was struck by the director's comments which made it sound as if the director's cut would be more to my liking. I wished it was available and you have no idea how excited I was to see the director's cut released! The Kingpin is far better now and really rocks! Other reviews have covered the benefits of the director's cut. I'll just say I'm glad I have both cuts on DVD and that the director's cut is sweet!
B0006B2A2E|5.0|Meet Joel Barish, a \\"nice,\\" shy, unassuming man, played by a much understated Jim Carrey. Meet Clementine Kruczynski, a wacky, spontaneous, uninhibited woman who colors her hair as often as she brushes her teeth. Kate Winslet is brilliant here. She bounces with energy as the vibrant Clem. And Carrey gives one of his most mature, deeply felt performances as Barish. Joel and Clementine meet each other. Sparks fly. It's love. The conventional and the eccentric collide. More sparks - a veritable conflagration. And then the inevitable. Kaput! Abruptly. Painfully. Clementine wants to \\"wash that man right outta her hair,\\" so she literally has him removed from her mind. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, (Tom Wilkinson), invented a procedure to erase isolated, unwanted memories. He provides this process through his company, Lacuna. Ever unpredictable, Clementine decides this is for her. The next time the ex-couple meets, Clementine acts as if she has never seen Joel before. Joel is astounded, confused. A friend, (the very funny David Cross), finally tells Joel that he has been erased. Devastated and depressed, Joel decides to have the same procedure performed.<br /><br />Most of the film's action takes place inside Joel's head. Hooked up to the memory-erasing apparatus, which pinpoints each Clementine-related memory in his brain and zaps it, he relives every moment before it's wiped-out. The emotional sense of loss is magnified, as one memory after another is visually annihilated. Unconscious, Joel realizes these moments are far too precious to destroy. Is it too late to save them?<br /><br />\\"Why remember a destructive love affair?\\"  So asks, Dr. Mierzwiak, who presides over a hearty-partying Lacuna staff, which includes: Patrick, the unethical technician, (Elijah Wood), who uses ill-gained information to court Clementine; Mary, the ditzy receptionist, (Kirsten Dunst), who fools around with senior technician, Stan, (Mark Ruffalo), while her heart lies elsewhere. This off-beat gang of unprofessionals is responsible for the comic relief. They bring unlooked for depth to their roles also.<br /><br />Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman takes us on a roller-coaster ride through the remarkable landscape of Joel Barish's mind. This unbelievable visual collage of memories, and shifted, twisted realities, is absolutely brilliant and most memorable. The cinematography, (Ellen Kuras), is amazing! Dreams morph into reality then fade back to fantasy, while people disappear in mid-stride, as Joel's brain cells are destroyed. There are no boundaries here.<br /><br />WOW! What a whimsical, delightful, poignant, refreshing gem of a film! I laughed out loud at times, and my eyes teared-up at others. Jim Carrey and Ms. Winslet really shine and emphasize, with their performances, our very human need for love. Eternal Sunshine's premise is that we need each other, even during those periods when being together interferes with being happy. As someone once said, \\"love is hard.\\" And \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" is, above all else, an original love story. The movie's title is a quotation from Alexander Pope's poem \\"Eloisa to Abelard:\\" \\"How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot! / The world forgetting, by the world forgot / Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind/ Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.\\"<br /><br />Kudos to director Michel Gondry, and Charlie Kaufman.

B00008BXJG|5.0|The five stars is for this classic album, whose quality is not in question. As far as the Epic remaster goes, I would probably give it three stars. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have pointed out that Epic's reissue of this album is not an improvement over the 1994 remaster (which was the second CD issue of this album). IMO not only is it not an improvement, but I don't think it even sounds as good as the 1994 version; although it is a definite improvment over the original CD issue, which was not very good. <br /> <br />The Epic remaster has a crisper, fuller, bass than the 1994 remaster, but unfortunately the bass tends to saturate the guitars in many places. Among a large collection of metal CD's, I have a handful of metal albums in which the digital remasterings just do not measure up to the sound of the original \\"records\\" or tapes, and this is one of them. <br /> <br />One of the things that made this album special--and helped to define the AC/DC sound of the period--was the \\"ringing\\" resonance of the Seymour Duncan Invader guitar pickups that was vividly captured by the original engineering. This quality has never been fully captured by any of the CD issues, but it was hinted at most clearly on the 1994 remaster (the original CD issue was just flat out dull-sounding, like the original CD issue of Back in Black). I don't know if this is because this is one of those intangibles that digital technology just can't capture; or if the problem has been engineers who, 25 years removed from Highway to Hell's original release date, just didn't quite \\"get\\" that this full, ringing, guitar sound is one of the things that made this album special. For example, the goal of the Epic engineer's remastering seemed to be to focus on the bass, perhaps based on the oversimplification that metal albums should always be \\"bass heavy.\\" You can almost hear the \\"ringing\\" resonance of the guitars in places where the they are not accompanied by the bass, such as the power chords at the beginning of \\"Walk All Over You\\" and \\"Love Hungry Man,\\" but when the guitars are fully backed by bass and drums, esp. in faster passages, the sound tends to become two-dimensional and the resonance of the guitars becomes swamped in bass.  <br /> <br />Knowing how CBS/Sony companies have handled the remastering of many albums in the past (they are my least favorite major label, for all genres), I had my doubts about how well that they would handle this reissue, and the result is about as I had expected: as usual, their emphasis is too much on marketing and packaging, and not enough on sound quality. I think it's unfortunate that AC/DC chose to sign with them, and that the rights to their back catalog reverted to Epic. If you are buying this issue because you need to have the \\"original album art,\\" that's fine; but don't get it if you are expecting improved sound quality; I only picked it up because I exchanged a gift for it. Although the sound quality of my 25 year old cassette of this album has dulled some, it still \\"rings\\" truer than the Epic deluxe reissue.
0060934913|5.0|Great book and a fun read.<br /><br />So what?  Everyone knows that there are few kitchens around that are truly sanitary.  Everyone knows that most kitchens take shortcuts in their work.  Don't you in your job?<br /><br />Thought so.<br /><br />This is simply a fun book to read.  Full of adventure in the world of cooking.  I really enjoyed every page.  Anyone who likes food will like this book.  A must read.
0425129608|4.0|Set at an English seaside summer resort, EVIL UNDER THE SUN is one of several Hercule Poirot mysteries involving a \\"love triangle\\" that is not quite what it appears to be (DEATH ON THE NILE is another and the most famous).  In EVIL UNDER THE SUN, beautiful but brainless Arlena Marshall is strangled on a beach, and the most obvious suspect appears to be Captain Marshall, her husband, who was jealous of her relationship with young, handsome Patrick Redfern.  While the police are eager to convict Marshall, Poirot (as usual) concerns himself with the case's psychological aspect, asking himself who at the resort is the true focus of evil:  Arlena (as everyone else assumes) or somebody else?  When Poirot finds the answer to this question, then he will have found Arlena's killer.  As always, Poirot's logic is brilliant; in fact, the dialogue contains a very funny line about Poirot's eternal competition with the dim-witted \\"local police.\\"  Agatha Christie's one flaw is neglecting to explain the drug-smuggling thread of the mystery in tying up the loose ends of the plot in the novel's final pages.  Two bits of trivia:  EVIL UNDER THE SUN was filmed in 1982, with Peter Ustinov as Poirot, and the more recent TV adaptation of \\"Triangle at Rhodes\\" - another \\"love triangle\\" story - starring David Suchet as Poirot, borrows some dialogue from EVIL UNDER THE SUN. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00014TJ7K|5.0|Till now I have listened 3 Harrison albums and all tof them are great. You should not be surprised because t he albums are \\"All things must pass\\", \\"Brainwashed\\" & \\"Cloud nine\\", three albums that are considered the best by him after four Beatles went their own way. \\"Cloud nine\\" contains some of the best tunes he has written supported by Eric Clapton's strings, two things that goes well together. <br /> <br />The original album had 11 tracks, out of which \\"Just For Today\\", \\"Someplace Else\\", \\"Breath Away From Heaven\\" are a little slow and not so rhythmic but  they are good songs on their own. The rest of the are very very tuneful, rhythmic and they are the reason this album deserves a full rating of 5 stars. \\"When we was Fab\\" sounded so much like Beatles, offcourse he intended to do the song like, more Beatles than Harrison, and it ends with Harrison playing sitar...it was good. Also I need to mention the funny \\"Gossip...Gossip...\\" chorus in \\"Devil Radio\\", very well done.  <br />But the best songs of the album are  <br />\\"That's What It Takes\\", (Just listen to the song  & solo at the end)  <br />\\"Fish On The Sand\\", (I guess Harrison wanted to describe himself in this song, he often wondered that he is out of place)  <br />\\"This Is Love\\", (Wonderful guitar, rhythm and vocal, very touching)  <br />\\"Got My Mind Set On You\\" (the hit from the album which has a video Harisson playing & singing the song and all the object of his room are shaking with the rhythm, superb) <br /> <br />Among the bonus tracks \\"Shanghai Surprise\\" from the movie of the same is quite good but \\"Zig zag\\" is the only let down of the album.  <br /> <br />A good introduction to the genious who is no more with us. His last two studio albums (Cloud nine & Brainwashed) were two of the best of his career but wish they were some unreleased material to follow them up. Highly recommended.

B000002LGW|5.0|Memories still vivid in my mind. June 1988. A gloomy, hot, humid night..perfect setting for a DM concert. We get the pleasure of other acts: Wired, Thomas Dolby,OMD..they finish..but we want the MODE. and around 7;30pm...the crowd awaiting for the quartet to take the stage start getting impatient. What happens? The biggest FOOD FIGHT in concert history errupts. Hot dogs, buns, shoes and an assortment of snack bar goodies flying through the air. It subsides and.. Whats that? The lights are dimmed and PIMPF plays in the air. Ther intro finishes..then with 2 loud bangs.. a recognizable bass is heard.. 'Behind the Wheel' starts this night of black celebration. Then as the song plays we hear Dave with the first verse. He sings but where is he? We cant see the band as they are behind a massive curtain. Then swiftly the curtain drops! There they were. DM. Right in front of our waiting eyeballs. The 65000+, black clad, new wave crowd goes nuts. We lost it. Couple of the most most memorable highlights were when they performed 'Blaspehmous Rumours'. Anyone that was also there remembers. During the performance a dark clowd formed above the Rose Bowl, then a loud bang of thunder, and it rained on that hot June night..heres the eerie part..only for that song! Freaked the hell out of our crowd man. Then when they performed 'Never Let me DOwn\\", Dave had all 65000 pairs of arms moving side to side. I cant really describe what it was like. THe energy and the vibe was outrageous. Dave was feeding of the crowd. At one point he held his face and started crying. So much emotion for the band and us. Never again have I expereinced such a concert. In my mind and many others..one of the best in concert history. DM FOREVER.
B00008J2R1|5.0|I read some of the reviews before I bought the SACD version of this album, and I trusted them. Most of the reviews were bad so I held off on buying it.  I thought the sound quality was outstanding and I can tell a huge improvement from the CD and SACD. Definately worth the buy.  I hope Oasis does the rest of their albums in SACD form.
B0006399FS|2.0|In fairness, I don't think this is a terrible album.  The melodies are catchy, the themes and lyrics are acceptable and occasionally compelling (although they do dip into cliche or circular logic at times).  What really spoils it for me is the feeling that U2 have tried to reproduce all their different \\"trademark\\" sounds with this album.   <br /> <br />I think this album tries to be all things to all people. <br /> <br />Track-by-track, this becomes very apparent: <br /> <br />1. Vertigo.  Sounds very close musically and thematically to \\"Discotheque\\".  \\"Hello hello\\" vs. \\"let go let go\\", plus both are fluffy ear-candy.  Not unpleasant, but not much substance.  Lyrics are incomprehensible and are kind of a pick 'n mix of previous U2 imagery.  Bono has been quoted as saying that the song is about a night club (discotheque?) called Vertigo.  Also, the bassline sounds suspiciously close to the opening of \\"Around the World\\" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Not the most original-sounding song, and forgettable. <br /> <br />2. Miracle Drug.  Lifts the bass-line straight from With Or Without You (probably U2's most memorable bass-line).  Edge's guitar solo is very reminiscent of Walk On, Kite, and the live version of Mysterious Ways.  Again, pleasant but feels like we've heard this song a million times before from U2.  Has a sing-along \\"yeah yeah\\" section which sounds like it has been lifted by the producers from \\"Until The End of the World\\". <br /> <br />3. Sometimes...  Seems to have been conceived as a blend of \\"One\\" and \\"Kite\\", with that falsetto-tinged chorus like \\"Stuck In A Moment\\".  The problem is that it sounds like a cut and paste -- instrumentation (including boom-boom drums) from \\"One\\", themes from \\"Kite\\".  Bono's vocals carry energy, but the emotion doesn't really connect, partly because his voice is raw and unwieldy.  I feel he oversings it a lot.  Stuff to listen to in the car. <br /> <br />4. Love and Peace or Else.  Sounds like they've been trying to remake \\"Zoo Station\\", complete with distorted intro, \\"trainwhistle\\" effects, and the overall aural feel of the song.  However, the lyrics are baffling \\"lay down your guns, daughters of Zion, Abraham's sons\\".  No clue is given to what the \\"Or Else\\" is in the title.  This song sounds like it's been improvised.  Again, relatively catchy, but not moving. <br /> <br />5. City of Blinding Lights.  This one strikes me as a mix between \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\" (building climax, keyboards and guitars jangling everywhere, rousing chorus, no doubt enormous light show in concert) and \\"New York\\".  Lyrics are lifted off \\"Last Night On Earth\\" from Pop (\\"the more you [this], the less you [that]\\", etc.).  Very satisfying Pop, but can't help feeling this is a bit formulaic.  Leaves me lukewarm. <br /> <br />6. All Because of You.  Sounds like an outtake from their rendition of \\"All Along The Watchtower\\" on Rattle & Hum. Same drums, near-identical guitar.  Lyrics seem a bit confused to me.  Big \\"hey hey\\" shouts from Bono also distinctly like a Rattle & Hum U2. <br /> <br />7. Man and a Woman.  Sonically, sounds a lot like \\"Wild Honey\\".  Lyrics here are interesting, I find this one of the more stimulating songs on the album.  It's understated and subtle.  Some references to Bono's wife make this sound a bit too self-serving for my taste.  Also, the opening \\"Little Sister\\" sounds exactly like George Michael's \\"Killer\\".  Not a bad song at all, but it still echoes too many other references to feel really fresh. <br /> <br />8. Crumbs From Your Table.  This is the big-themed song of the album, clearly referecing Bono's AIDS campaigning.  It's a catchy mid-tempo pop ballad, and could be straight out of their previous album.  The feel and timing feel remarkably close to \\"Walk On\\".  Sadly, feels recycled again. <br /> <br />9. One Step Closer.  This is the quiet two-chord verse and three-chord chorus little number on the album.  Think \\"Running To Stand Still\\" (Joshua Tree), think \\"The First Time\\" (Zooropa), think \\"Velvet Dress\\" (Pop).  We have heard this sooo many times before.  The instrumentation is a copycat of previous work (with some electro-white noise similar to \\"Slug\\" on the Passengers album), and the vocal performance is a bit weak.  Some nice imagery, but meandering and not wholly convincing.  One step closer to what?  To death, it seems, but the angst or relief hinted at in the song gets lost in a number of platitudes.  Ultimately, there's no real conclusion to the song. <br /> <br />10. Original of the Species.  This one sounds more original (no pun) than the rest, but sadly feels stuck in the late 1970s.  Opening piano chords, father talking to his teenage child, and chorus with Edge's ringing guitars.  I think this could be a very strong piece, but the lyrics lose me every time (\\"I'll give you everything you want, except the thing that you want, you are the first one of your kind\\").  Not sure what Bono's saying here.  A pity, doesn't reach the heights that it could. <br /> <br />11. Yahweh.  I can't take this song seriously.  First the lyrics: \\"Take these shoes [...] take this shirt\\".  Let's hark back to \\"Do You Feel Loved?\\" on Pop, and oh surprise: \\"Take these boots [...] take my shirt\\".  The instrumentation and chord progression are the radio-friendliest you can imagine.  Singing \\"Yahweh\\" as a chorus?  Sounds a bit messianic, and just like a Christian rock song.  I know U2 have always had their side to them, but in the past at least it was couched a bit more ambiguously.  Basically, I think if you're not religious, this song is a bit difficult to understand.  Interestingly, \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" on Pop also explored a dialogue with God, but tied it to our daily lives.  This is Bono trying to find religious ecstasy.  He's fairly convincing, but it's a pity that the rest of the band is on radio-pop autopilot. <br /> <br />In summary, there's nothing very new or stimulating on this album.  It's not bad - you could do a lot worse than to purchase this.  However, this is not good U2.  Rather, this is U2 re-hashing everything they've done before.  If you're unfamiliar with U2, this is probably as good an introduction as any.  If you're a long-time fan, I'd say don't bother buying it - you're better off listening to their previous work. <br />
B000056K04|5.0|This is the first DMB album I bought and I got it the first week it came out. I had listened to the other albums through friends and had also attended DMB concerts with those friends so I was familiar with the usual DMB sound. <br />Although this album is different, it does not cease to be great. The soul of DMB is intact. <br />Bands have to divert styles in order to grow. Otherwise they can get stuck recycling the same crap in every album. We can say that DMB is very far from recycling any material.  <br />Now I own every DMB album and it's \\"Everyday\\" that made me want to get the others and appreciate them on my own.  <br />One of my favorites in this album is \\"Angel,\\" comparing love to a game of poker? I'm in! <br />\\"If I Had it All\\" with the voice of a desperate Dave is just amazing, and \\"Mother, Father\\" is classic DMB.  <br />No complains from me. Made DMB my favorite band. <br />
B0000TB050|3.0|Overall: <br /> <br />By and large, this is a good concert and a good recording of it.  However, at every viewing, it gives me the feeling that U2 are self-centered during the show (well, more than usual) and basking in the (huge) crowd's adoration.  OK, this is arguably normal for a rock band, but U2 concerts are such great events because the band tend to take nothing for granted, and give it as much as they can (see the 1994 Zoo TV or 1998 PopMart videos).  This is not the case here, so it comes across as a bit lacklustre. <br /> <br />The setlist: <br /> <br />There are a number of classics here, but noticeably their more experimental (and interesting) work from the 1990s is completely under-represented.  Instead, we get a revival of oldies (\\"Out of Control\\", \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\"), plus songs from their 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind (which the tour was promoting).  The new songs sound and feel very much like the old ones.  That in itself is nothing to frown at, but it does make the entire setlist feel very nostalgic.  It's like listening to an endless \\"Best Of\\" of songs that sound more or less the same.  This is like U2 saying \\"aaah, what a great career we've had\\".  The setlist lacks balance, it lacks an arc.  There's no real sense of a beginning, middle, and end to the show (see Zoo TV for a much better structured setlist). <br /> <br />The Show Itself: <br /> <br />The Elevation Tour was hailed as the band's best, most successful, etc.  I disagree, and this DVD highlights why. <br />Despite being performed in front of 80,000 people, there is nothing that really draws in the crowd, or tries to wow them.  Mostly it's the four band members performing with a few colored lights thrown in (and tons of close-ups of Bono's ever-wrinklier face).  I suppose this is mainly because the tour centered on smaller venues, but still, the spectacle doesn't really look like anything special on DVD.  Also, sadly, the band seems a bit uninterested in what they're doing.  Edge is po-faced the entire time, Adam is invisible, and Larry just looks bored behind his drum-kit.  Bono jiggles around and prances, but the parts where he really gets going are identical to what he did on Zoo TV and PopMart, so no points for originality.  Actually a bit boring. <br /> <br />Bono's voice is really not what it used to be.  He stretches and screeches through the concert, and seems to have no volume control -- everything is either whispered or howled.  The rest of the band plays very well, but lacks passion.  Edge's better solos (\\"Until The End of the World\\", \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\") used to sound wild and fierce, but now are so precise and clean that they feel like they belong in some suburban TV ad.  Otherwise, Bono tries to reach out and speak to the crowd, but when he says \\"by now each of you has probably given us five hundred pounds\\", it sounds grossly out of place.  This is a concert, it's for the audience, not an opportunity to remind everyone how wealthy the band are. <br /> <br />The DVD package: <br /> <br />Underwhelming.  \\"Mysterious Ways\\" is a bonus track, which is performed badly (Bono just can't sing it anymore), and features his laughable attempts at dancing.  To add insult to injury, Bono brings his 10-year old daughter on stage, and they just wiggle around together for what feels like five hours while the band plays on.  Did I mention self-centered earlier? <br /> <br />\\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" documentary is also included, which I find very uninteresting.  Good footage of the band trying to fight its awkwardness to record some good songs, but again self-serving promo with some artsy camera work.  Snore-inducing. <br /> <br />Conclusion: <br /> <br />So what are we left with?   <br />- A generally good concert, but flawed in ways that make it unbalanced.   <br />- An average show/set design with nothing that makes you crave to be at the concert.   <br />- A still-OK-but-aging band, with weakening vocals and a tendency to be self-referential and self-centered.   <br />- A HUGE crowd which is the only real reason why this concert looks epic. <br />- DVD extras that you'll probably never watch twice. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a decent concert DVD, by all means get this.  If you're looking for a great concert DVD, or for the seminal U2 concert video, get Zoo TV Live From Sydney or PopMart from Mexico instead.
0385510454|2.0|Not an entirely bad read, it just wasn't very exciting for me. I think the book is interesting during the first few chapters; however, the story is more and more and more of the same. This story could have been wrapped up in 5 chapters; however, by dragging it though 36 slow-boil chapters, the only thing hunted and assassinated is suspense.
0316172324|4.0|The first chapter was the hook, but as it went on it began to get a little repetitive.  It wasn't really adding anything new and the topics began to feel scattered.  It was as if the author had a bunch of really cool stories and facts that kinda-sorta all fit together, so he slapped them in.<br /><br />That said, I found most of it very interesting.  It was also pretty easy to read - despite feeling scattered.  If you're interested in a collection of psychological research in a fun, easy to read and understand format, pick up a copy of Blink.  I enjoyed reading it.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I've enjoyed James Denton's performance as Mike Delfino, both the humor and laughs (finding Susan au natural in the bush) and his darker side that we are just starting to see.  I got lucky and my cable provider picked up the HDTV version of ABC the week before Desperate Housewives started--this show is perfect for high definition, with all the work they go to with landscaping, etc.  It's been my favorite show this year.  I like how it's a drama with the suspense stories, but also, for me, the forty minutes of show each week seems to pack in the amount of laughs you'd expect from a two hour comedy movie.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a wonderful, nostalgic romp through old movie serials.  And it probably heralds a new paradyme in movie-making, making it well worth a look. <br /> <br />But Sky Captain is not worth more than a look.  It lacks much of the warmth, humor, and plot twists that made Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark so delightful.  It concentrates too much on art and not enough on making the viewer care about the characters and about their various predicaments.  As a result, the action sequences seem a bit cold and rote, as if they were included just because it they were expected to be there. <br /> <br />In the end, Sky Captain remains a remarkable effort.  And I eagerly await its makers' next movie.  But as it is, Sky Captain is best seen as an example of what is to come and as yet another reminder that dazzling technology is not enough; a movie also needs a good plot, realistic humor, and characters that we can care about if it is to become a classic in its own right.
044024157X|2.0|The Last Juror was a sad disappointment.  I had heard great things about John Grisham but had never read any of his books.  I chose to read this for a book club, and had it not been my responsibility to finish it, I probably would have never finished it.  It was moderately suspenseful in the beginning, and then it just died off.  Danny went to jail, and that was it.  All of a sudden I was smothered with meaningless details about Willie's life and acceptance in Mississippi.  At that point, I didn't care if Danny was guilty or not.  I didn't care how the story ended.  But as I said, I had to read it, so I skipped through a few pages of blabber, and made my way through the painfully boring ending.  It was a sad excuse for a suspense novel.

There were too many things given to the viewers in Karate Kid (part one) that they could make fun of - so people can't keep a straight face when mentioning the films.  It's too bad in my opinion:  Wax on, wax off;  the crane kick;  jacka--es even love to make fun of the character Mr. Miagi. <br /> <br />The first one was a good teen movie.  About a new kid in town, fresh in from Jersey, who develops a crush on a girl - but then the ex-boyfriend and his friends try to ruin the kid's life.  Not only do they ride motorcycles, but they also know karate. <br /> <br />Now, I liked part two better than part one.  I think it was the Okanowa setting (I hope I didn't spell that wrong), I really loved it.   <br /> <br />Part three and four I did not enjoy.  Part three was made to look like more of a sequel to the original - than part two was.  It was a revenge story for the leader of the Cobra Kai (the bad guys in part one), it was very dishonorable, and a disgrace.  I did not enjoy it one bit.  It also made the character of Daniel look like he didn't learn anything in the first two films.   <br /> <br />After part three's cash-in - it was silly to exploit the films any further, but then came \\"The Next Karate Kid\\".  Another story of a loner student.  I think part of the story was about nursing pigeons on a rooftop.  The movie was nothing but a marketing scheme.  <br /> <br />Anyways, I wish that they sold the first two by themselves - in these new versions, for fans like myself who felt that parts three and four were trash.  But many people liked part three.  Sure, I like to root for the villian in movies - but that program's story was distasteful in my opinion.
B0000669JL|4.0|this is a great classic to own....but its reggae....not latin ?...why is it the top seller in the latin section....did i miss something?

B00064ADR0|5.0|Growing up in Ft Worth, Texas in the 60s and 70s I would here Johnny Winter on the local stations. These were the same radio stations SRV listened to over in Dallas. Second Winter is a great collection of late 60's vintage Texas Blues with Johnny's unique licks. You'll hear what definately inspired Stevie Ray to become the legend he is.
B00006AG5N|3.0|Sure some ballads like I CANT HELP FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU,LOVE ME TENDER still sound fresh, even if mainly for a teenage listener. But do JAILHOUSE ROCK, and DONT BE CRUEL really belong among the best pop song recordings ever? I don't think so! Frankly, there is a lot of mediocrity in this over-rated songster's catalogue! Yes, he died at age 42, very sad, but that's no reason for the near de-ification this fellow has since received. Among his contemporaries who died even younger, there is one with a far better song catalogue..yes, that's right..Bobby Darin, now getting some very deserved,renewed attention! Is Elvis the #1 songster of them all? Hardly! Mr. Sinatra, and his incredible recording catalogue (over 50 years, longer than Elvis's entire life) completely blows away Elvis! Not to mention the Beatles, creators and performers of some of the best songs ever!
B0006IIPIK|5.0|With it's nostalgic opening credits to it's eye-rolling sound-effects of yesteryear, Sky Captain is a trip back in time to when a script didn't need to make perfect sense, it just had to be fun. Sky Captain is a PERFECT example of this, as the movie has the same feel as an old 1940's B movie.(For those who don't know, a B movie was the \\"other\\" movie, the one right below the years big blockbuster)      Don't see this movie with high acting expectations or a brilliant plot in mind. The movie is intended to be veiwed with a light heart. If you do watch it with the above expectations you'll be unimpressed and disapointed. BUT! Watch it knowing it's meant to be a little lame and you'll have a great movie thats worth buying and having for years to come. If you've read the other reviews you already know the plot. Your probably reading mine to know WHY you should see it. See it for nostalgia if your old enough, see it for the cool retro-ness of it if your young enough and just see it to have fun. Thats what movies are made for, right? if you don't have fun watching movies, then why are you wasting your time watching them at all?     P.S. The movie is BEST viewed in Black and White. Although there is no option on the movie to play it as such(it was going to be black and white but you know movie studios, they don't like to take chances) so in order to watch it in black and white go down to your Menu on your TV and select COLOR. Adjust it til it's the bar is gone or at 0 and viola! B and W Sky Captian! Watching it in B and W is a real treat and must be watched to fully enjoy the uniqueness of this fun and enduring film. I hope you enjoy it!
B00005JMEW|4.0|Tarantino is without no doubt the master of violence movies!<br /><br /> Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are classics. He can also write interesting stories and create terrific characters.<br /><br />You don't need many words to descripe Tarantino's new movie.<br /><br />Blood, violence, battles and revenge are good ones. Uma Thurman is an excelent choice for main role because she can play very killer and revenger roles. If you like terrific fighting acts and don't fear to see ultimate violence then I recommand Kill Bill vol.1 for you. The most intering part of this movie is bloody animation in the middle of the film. It looks like Japanes manga cartoon! Lucy Liu makes a fine and short visit on Kill Bill vol. 1 before her time has come...<br /><br /> Tarantino almost made a classic movie but not enough because there is too much fight and too less plot
0446530891|2.0|Split Second was a perfect example of a time passer.  You won't be blown away by the plot, you won't care about the characters one second after you close it, and you won't recommend it to anyone you know, but the simplistic writing style he chose for this book somehow keeps you turning the pages.  Books like these are the quicksand of all book stores.  It's displayed every which way you turn, the first 10 pages are as a razor sharp hook, and as with most pop fiction written in the past few years, the ending is so underwhelming you can't help but picture the author realizing that he had waded in way over his head and had no idea how to bring the story home.  You imagine him standing in front of a bulletin board filled with the names of all 150 character/suspects he used as page filler and throwing a dart to see who's gonna take the rap in the end. <br />     BUT, like I said, the pages do turn with ease, which is a small treasure in itself compared with all the long winded, snowflake describing, Steinbeck wannabe's that are constantly shoveled into our face by the media these days.   <br />    If you like Pop Fiction, this book is more than readable, but you'd be better off omitting the last 30 pages and imagining your own ending.  You couldn't do much worse. <br />
B000002KKS|3.0|I often think of Black Sabbath's \\"Heaven and Hell\\" as somewhat of an experiment for producer Martin Birch.  Meaning, I don't think he really captured the sound of the Sabs.  Don't get me wrong, the album does not stink by any means, but my 3 star score is based on how the album sounds.  Black Sabbath have always been known for being one of the heaviest bands ever, as I'm sure most people would agree, but this record seemed to lack the heavy guitar and thundering bass and drums that long time fans have come to love and expect from Sabbath.  For starters, Tony Iommi's guitar sounds a bit muffled in the mix and does not come across as a scaithing, 10 ton wall of sound as we've heard on previous Sabbath albums.  Geezer Butler's bass is at times a bit too loud for the Sabs in my opinion and Bill Ward's percussionary efforts do show signs of growth but at the same time it just seems too polished.  That is my problem with \\"Heaven and Hell.\\"  It is just too clean and crisp for me.  If you, as a fan of heavy metal, are familiar with producer Martin Birch, then you must know of him from the great band, Iron Maiden.  Birch propelled Maiden into the stratosphere producing albums like \\"Killers, The Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind and Powerslave.\\"  Martin was perfect for Iron Maiden because they were a more precise and spot on band.  But, back to Black Sabbath.  This is Ronnie James Dio and his big debut with the Sabs and at the time, most everyone agreed that he had some mighty big shoes to fill.  Replacing Ozzy Osbourne must have seemed like a daunting task indeed, but I feel he handled it rather well.  I would'nt say it was better than Ozzy and I would'nt say it was worse, but it was different.  Ronnie James really shines on Sabbath's 9th album.  If you are a Dio fan, there are some really great tunes on this album that suit his personality.  Such as the upbeat \\"Neon Knights\\" and the classic \\"Children of the Sea.\\"  The title track has come to be known as one of Sabbath's live favorites with Dio behind the mic and \\"Die Young\\" is a scorcher.  Dio is definetly the star of this record and he shines.  I will give Martin Birch credit for making Ronnie sound so good on this album.  \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is a good, tight and clean album, but a little too clean for my tastes as far as Black Sabbath is concerned.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Ever since Aerosmith and Run-D.M.C. collaborated on \\"Walk This Way\\", many rock and rap artists have given it their all to combine the two genres. But even the best ones, like Cypress Hill and the Beastie Boys, have always had a slight line to seperate the music; it never fully blended. That all changed when Limp Bizkit entered the music scene though. Their 1999 LP, \\"Significant Other\\", is a pure masterpiece that crosses over to be one of the greatest hip-hop AND hard rock albums in recent years. That is because the album works so well in the two genres, making it almost impossible to classify. Lead singer, Fred Durst worked with his own life experiences to create the remarkable writing throughout the disc. The album also contains three hardcore hit songs:  - \\"Nookie\\" A+. The song is hardcore and rough, but underneath the surface lies true depth and emotion. Connection's to the listener are found because the content is something that can be seen in daily life. Wheras most singles use material like this to create tragic songs, Limp Bizkit shows the side of rage; which seems in the realms of reality. Surprisingly, this is THE best song of 1999.  - \\"Break Stuff\\" A-. Not filled with much depth, and it makes has no desire to be. It is an unapologetic, heavily explicit track filled with rage and anger. At that it is a sucsess because it captures so much emotion in it's brief running time. Every person has felt like this, no matter how much we try to deny it. It's refreshing to hear true rage venilated.  - \\"N 2 Gether Now\\" (feat. Method Man) B. With this song, more than any other one, the group really shows how rap they can be. Of course Method Man's raps are of his usual Wu-Tang quality, but the song really transcends to rap because Fred Durst seems like a natrual rapper. While D.J. Premier's production is top notch and very fited for Limp and Meth; the song doesn't really break any new ground subject wise.  In addition, there are four other songs that could have become hit sinlges as well: \\"Re-Arranged\\" is a terrific walk in Everlast territory; filled with piercing lyrics, a striking beat and a showcase for Fred Durst as a vocalist. \\"I'm Broke\\" functions as a tough, entertaining song about money, and the anger that come with the lack of it. An anthem for the group can be found in \\"9 teen 90 nine\\", which is a catchy, clever song designed to connect with the fans and listeners. And \\"No Sex\\" is a regretful, heartfelt track about a relationship turned sour; not what the title suggests. The only track that doesn't fully work is \\"A Lesson Learned\\", because the vocals are not allowed to fully shine thruogh the eerie beats. It's still listenable though.  Bottom Line: ****. Terry Date's production, combined with Limp Bizkit's vocals and insturmentals, make this an excellent album for both hard rock and hip-hop. It's a masterpiece that is often over looked, despite that fact that it shows Limp Bizkit at the top of the rock and hip-hop game. What a great album.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Personally I think this is not only jack johnson's best album, but the best album of all time. If you have heard one of his songs and like it, then buy this cd because if you like one then you'll like them all. This is probably the only cd i have ever had that i love every single song on the cd. If you are considering buying this cd, just get i promise you won't regret it. If you like this cd, i recommend checking out Joe Sneva.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|i think i went into buying this album with too much of a high expectation. devils night was amazingly bizarre. when i first got the album i was a bit angry because it seemed to be full of club tracks and they were rapping about stuff that just wasnt them.but then i listened to it a few more times and once i listen to the lyrics its a pretty funny album and they havent totally lost it. bizarre is a random mofo  and he gets his moments on some tracks which is always good. the rest are sort of relegated to standard fare but amusing nonetheless.in my opinion, eminem is quite annoying on this album but hes just so freakin clever/cocky  it doesnt even matter. bugz rocks his track we need to hear more from that guy. they got him interrupting american psycho 2 -amazing. good die young is pretty sad and kanyes production was annoying at first but it grew on me with its carnivally/ classical jig. just like u would be perfect if it wasn't cut so much..even thought we get the idea of the cut words it just ruins the flow of this supersized comedic genius. i think if d12's next album is any better than this then they will be on par with eminem on his solo work... cos even eminem has his rough spots..not that this is a rough spot just isnt a 'rampant bunny rabbit sex' spot.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|The car chase is one of the most inexplicable scenes I have seen on film. What is going on? Is it exciting? Darned if I know. It was just a lot of quick cuts. The director needed to sit and watch Ronin again---driving against traffic is impressive visually, but only if you can actually see what's going on!<br /><br />Okay, rant over. The Bourne Identity is one of the best, intelligent action movies of recent years. This sequel is watchable, Matt Damon does a quite reasonable job, but a pale shadow of the original.
B00002SWEM|5.0|Maybe i am a bit biased because i absolutely adore cuban music and especially Buena Vista Social Club cd. However this DVD gives you a perspective of the singers' and players' life. This makes the DVD very intersting and the amazing music also makes it even better.  <br />
B0002234LS|3.0|Secret Window, is listed as suspense rather than the usual horror label, an adaptation of a Stephen King story, \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\". But with a cast featuring Johnny Depp, John Tuturro and Charles Dutton, I thought this movie would be worth the effort. And it is, as far as the acting concerned, but the acting seriously outweighs the quality of the screenplay, which begins promisingly enough, but fails to deliver much in the way of ongoing suspense. However, there is an uneven tension that recurs in various scenes.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Johnny Depp comes through on screen, as the confused writer suddenly accosted on his front porch by a menacing John Shooter (Tuturro), who claims: \\"You stole my story.\\" Shooter gives Mort Rainey (Depp) a time limit to prove him wrong, before taking action for the injustice. That he does, with a vengeance and when playing menacing, Tuturro is the man. As the story unfolds and the writer drifts in and out of an alcoholic haze, a picture emerges of his broken marriage, unfaithful wife, Maria Bello, and her lover, Timothy Hutton. Mort Rainey slowly unravels as Shooter's deadline approaches, his actions ever more chaotic as bodies mount up around him, proof of authorship slipping through his fingers to the ultimate denouement.<br /><br />As Mort Rainey, Depp captures the screen with his quirky take on the befuddled writer and Tuturro's role is all to brief as the threatening John Shooter. Charles Dutton plays a short but memorable role as a private security guard hired by Rainey and Maria Bello is believable as the faithless wife. Timothy Hutton seems particularly uncomfortable in his role as Bello's lover, anxious to take over Depp's place in her life, but without much depth or interest. In all, Secret Garden is worth watching for those moments of interaction between Depp and Tuturro, not to mention Depp's ongoing dialog with himself, as his character comes to terms with his own subconscious frustration and anger about his broken marriage. Beset by a spiraling mental claustrophobia and moral confusion, Depp skillfully maneuvers through the story, eventually surfacing as a new man entirely. Luan Gaines/2005.is broken marriage.

B00009XITP|5.0|I LOVE \\"What a Girl Wants.\\" It's funny, uplifting, has a brilliant cast, and is utterly enjoyable. Okay, so it's not the most original story ever, (girl wants to find dad, girl discovers that being herself is better than pretending to be someone else, etc.) but it still felt lightweight and fresh. I've seen this movie several times and I enjoy it every time I see it. The basic premise of the story is sweet and relatively well written (especially compared to other sloppily made 'teen' movies), and the characters are enjoyable. I especially like Daphne's (the very watchable and perky Amanda Bynes) relationship with her father (the brilliant, to say the least, Colin Firth), which the story mostly revolves around. The setting in London is fun and sets up a bit of British humour (got to love the Brits). Overall it's a fun movie, appropriate for all ages, and a great choice if you're looking for something that's lightweight yet still has a bit of substance.
B000003TA4|5.0|this is one of the best cds ive ever heard, nirvana is a huge influence on me...dont listen to people like \\"MNB\\". If your only 20 now then you were 10 years old in 1995, OBVIOUSLY YOUR MEMORY WAS BLURRY! and you claim you didnt hear about nirvana untill 96, well buddy, you were 11 then, no wonder you didnt, that doesnt mean that everyone else didnt know who they were before kurt died, that could be the most stupid post ive ever read on amazon.com...or anywhere. on to the cd, a lot of nirvana fans say your a poser if you like this cd the best, or smells like teen spirit the most, well i dont think thats true....i think thats stupid. the best songs on this cd, in my oppinion, are in bloom, territorial pissings, smells like teen spirit, lounge act, on a plain and many others. stay away is a good song also, but probally the worst on this album. I recomend picking up the box set if you like this, its all of nirvanas unreleased stuff.<br /><br />another thing....is that the person \\"Corky \\"glranttalo\\"\\" said that they are the most overated and worst bands ever....how old are you?! you have a pokemon game in your wish list! your probally 9 years old and dont know what talent is. anyways...someone said that dave grohl doesnt know how to drum...wrong...dave grohl in my oppinion is probally the most talented at playing an instrument in this band, or any others...he is one of the greatest drummers ever, he doesnt drum in foo fighters which gets me mad....but he is still very good. Yes kurt cobain wansnt the greatest guitar player...but he was a very good song writer...He was amazing,....if your a fan, or even if your not a fan, get this album, it changed music forever.

B00005Q4CS|4.0|When a film has a repuation like that of Requiem For A Dream, its fair to say that there will be plenty of naysayers in the crowd. And while I'm not one of them, I can't say I'm in a rush to join the hardcore fans either. Ultimately, I'd say that RFAD succeeds in what it is trying to do. Set around Harry Goldfarb, his mother Sarah, girlfriend Marion and best friend Tyrone, the film is a exciting yet simplistic look at drug addiction.<br /><br />There's really no denying the power of this film. Though many will say that the arty directing techniques have been done before and the characters are poorly developed (both fair criticisms, mind) this film completely blew me away the first time I saw it. Its intense, fast moving and ultimately depressing. So why am I refering to it as entertainment? Because really, that's all it is. Visually its incredibly impressive but the storyline and the themes in the film are weak and simplistic. The whole 'don't do drugs' thing makes this film come across as a piece of government propaganda at times. You'll end up in jail! You'll poison yourself! You'll become a prostitute! You'll go mad! All in all its far too politically correct for its own good and so busy shoving its own agenda down your throat that you're left with no room to breathe. I'm not looking for a film that attempts to justify heroin use or deny its dangers but I don't need to be reminded of its dangers 24/7.<br /><br />RFAD will impress and depress you with its powerful imagery and fast moving pace (not to mention Ellen Burstyn's stunning performance as a lonely widow) but after two or three viewings (by which time the shock value will have fallen) it comes across as little more than entertaiment for the mentally masochistic. If you want a film about drugs, Trainspotting is the one you want. If you want a film that plays with your emotions, then Irreversible is superior to this. Requiem For A Dream is in some respects a must-see, but it doesn't make you think nor does it present any ideas or themes that you've never seen before. It still gets 4 stars because if I said I didn't like it or that I wasn't very impressed when I first saw it, I'd be lying. But then I'd also be lying if I said it was anywhere near as good as the likes of Fight Club, Mulholland Drive or Memento.eas or themes that you've never seen before.

B0006A9FMI|5.0|While other reviewers feel the need to flame the DVD, I'd rather discuss the movie.  I hope you'll find that helpful.<br /><br />No, there is no English language option.  Nor should there be.  The tanslators and voice actors would only mess it up.<br /><br />No, there aren't a lot of special features.  Maybe those inclined to fifteen hours of featurettes should sell the DVD player and watch E! all day.<br /><br />Now, to discuss the movie.  If you don't know Shirow, you should.  He is a prolific writer and artist with a keen mind.  His work has always focused on the problems we humans have with each other.  The cyborgs (and mecha etc. etc.) are merely tools to point this out.  You're out of luck if you're looking for some kind of cyborg movie.  It's not about cyborgs.  Not really.<br /><br />Shirow has a skill for shining light into the darkness of this terchnological jungle we're creating, and everything, from design to engineering, idea to technique, must be as original as it is realistic.<br /><br />:Innocence is a fabulous ride, with glorious effects and an immortal story.  Do not miss it.
B0000013GT|5.0|I don't quite know where to start or where to end when it comes to an album that has established its status as a classic as firmly as this one has. Here's  a sampling of the lyrics: <br /> <br />True I got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me <br />To the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check <br />If you don't move yo' foot then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck <br />Yes we done come a long way like them slim ass cigarettes <br />From virginia, this ain't gon stop so we just gonna continue. <br /> <br />Damn. <br /> <br />To say that there just aren't rhymers out there that have the depth and flow that Outkast had 9 years ago would hardly be an overstatement. This album is what happened when two young rappers from Atlanta set foot in the studio, focused as all hell, and cranked out a masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and cop this album. But if other rap starts sounding like crap, don't say I didn't warn you!
B0001Z53CY|2.0|Can this be the same D-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner? Well, I guess this really does prove they are only a side-show. Eminem has different production, so the group will have different production. Eminem went more serious, now the group is more serious.  <br /> <br />Besides that, Shady himself (or what is left of what he use to be) is basically a no-show. In any track Eminem's in, it's usually the strongest, and that is the case here; However, that doesn't mean he was great. That means the CD itself is misconfusion, contradiction, and a side-show for Eminem's next CD (\\"Encore\\", which was better then this, but not that great overall, as well).  <br /> <br />D-12 is the commercials to the Eminem Show, everyone's just waiting to get in between them. That's the case here.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie after the hype, and found Cruise and Foxx to be both believable and talented in their  respective roles. A brief synopsis finds hard working and \\"nice\\" cab driver Max (Foxx) being unwittingly hired for the evening by ice cold mystery man Vincent (Cruise), and then dropped knee deep into an assassination spree, from which he is inextricably trapped. After a moderately slow start, the story builds nicely, with some intelligent plot work, good action sequences, and promises much in suspense, action, and the ability to hold your attention. Somewhere in the middle of the movie this gets lost, and even the most innatentive of viewers will see what's coming next from a mile away, and that's a real shame. Cruise and Foxx play off each other nicely, and there's a strange attraction to Cruises meticulous character, despite his sociopathic tendencies, and ice cold indifference to his victims. This is not a bad movie, but let's itself down with some avoidable mistakes, the main one being to revert to unlikely and implausible outcomes, just to reach the desired ending it self telegraphed earlier. Questions you may find yourself asking are: (DANGER SPOILER AHEAD)<br /><br />1. The US Attorney general building is guarded by one solitary guard, and otherwise uninhabited?<br />2. Despite numerous security features in the building, Max is able to gain entry by simply walking through a side door?<br />3. Max can run, jump and arrive to save the day from half a mile away on a parking lot roof, before Vincent can go from the 14th to the 16th floor in the same building?<br />4. Three armed FBI units, a night club security team, LAPD, and a South American Druglords hit squad ALL in the same building with weapons drawn, ALL miss the target?<br /><br />These are just a few discrepancies, in an otherwise tight and pacy thriller, but given that a multitude of better directions with the story could have been taken, the one chosen is a disappointment. Good movie, but NOT great. Enjoynjoy
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I imagine a lot of Amazon shoppers will be confused about the various reviews claiming that this DVD of Lonesome Dove is cut down and is not the full length, original version. Sadly, a lot of this is Amazon's fault, for erroneously listing the running time as 240 minutes (4 hours). This is absolutely incorrect. Having just ordered this and watched it, I can say that it is the original 6 hours-and-change version (the extra 2 hours from the original 8 miniseries coming from commercials). <br /> <br />As far as the quality of this movie, I don't believe I can add anything else that hasn't been said. I can sum it up with: you can't go wrong with this DVD. For $11 and change, it has got to be one of the greatest bangs for your buck in entertainment value you can buy on this website.
0671015206|3.0|It was interesting to learn that the people with high net worth were not generally those who look that way -- according to the surveys the authors conducted, wealthy people were most often those who didn't appear wealthy. The secret of their high net worth, the authors contend, is that they are PAWs (\\"Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth\\"), or in other words frugal, those who save or invest a much higher percentage of their income compared to the rate they consume. The authors even go ahead to redefine what it is to be wealthy. Congruent to the results of their study, \\"wealthy\\" people are exactly those who continue to accumulate no matter what their income, and are not those who currently possess much but do not accumulate. Though simple at first sight, I found their new definition to be useful, and this much I can say that I have gained from the book.    However the lesson I mentioned I learnt is just about everything the book offers. There is no so to say royal way to make money other than being frugal, evading tax as much as one can, and allocating as much time and energy to financial planning as possible, the authors claim. Perhaps this is the reason why the second chapters on appear redundant. The car example the authors quote repeatedly throughout the book is typical in this regard. It was indeed interesting to learn that the Ford pickup model was the most popular (and not some conspicuous foreign made high performance car) among the millionaires surveyed, but calculating the cost per pound of a good fraction of the cars currently available in the market? The very first time the authors wrote about \\"you aren't what you drive,\\" I got the message. It would have been much more educational if the authors instead included a study on the distribution of the industries those millionaires worked in (there is a such list at the end of the book, but no distribution statistics).    Speaking of examples, I found some statistical results curious. For instance, in a early chapter of the book where the authors present a study on the ancestry groups of the millionaires surveyed (to ultimately claim that millionaires are mostly self-made) I could not find data for Afro Americans, Hispanics, or Asians. It is plausible that these ethnic groups (representing 28%+ of US population as of 2000) were not included because they did not have high percentage of millionaires per ethnic household and the table presented contained only the top ten in this measure. But recent studies of net worth stratified by ethnicity (for e.g. studies by L. Hao of Johns Hopkins Univ.) indicate Asian immigrants having higher median net worth compared to other US immigrant ethnic groups including Whites. Could it be that the majority of Asians are UAWs (the opposite of PAWs -- \\"Under Accumulators of Wealth\\")? As for a glaring omission. The authors assert that an overwhelming majority of millionaires they surveyed were self-employed. This much I am able to believe in good faith. But what exactly is the ratio between self-employed and not (for e.g. physicians, lawyers, engineers etc)? Wouldn't this ratio be more meaningful than including the types of credit cards those millionaires hold?    The strength of this book compared to others in the same category is in that the authors conducted real field work. Some results were revealing, but as noted earlier, many of them were redundant. It would be interesting to read a volume on the same subject that does not try too hard to appeal to the general public.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I can't say I have ever laughed at anything so hard since.  Neil Simon's parody of the 1930's and 1940's detective stories is superbly cast:  Peter Falk plays Sam Spade, James Coco is Hercule Poirot, Peter Sellers is Charlie Chan, David Niven and Maggie Smith are reflections of Nick and Nora Charles. They're all summoned to Truman Capote's home to try and find out who is trying to kill them all. It's Simon intermixed with Clue and neither suffers for the blending.  ENDORE!  ENDORE!
0765301598|2.0|(This is basically a review of the entire 2nd trilogy.) <br /> <br />I didn't like this 2nd trilogy nearly as much as the first trilogy these 2 guys wrote. It wasn't just that the subject matter, now being displaced 1000 of years before the original Dune book, isn't connected nearly as intimately to the original books (there are none of the characters from the original books in these), but I also think the 2 writers just laxed up on the writing: parts of this seem more amateurish and stylized than the first trilogy, and some of the writing is just not good. <br />     There are a lot of other problems, too, both big and small: 1)Just some things that were hard to buy, or didn't make sense, like: Why didn't the machines use atomics (they do give some non-persuasive reasons for this at one point)? Was it really possible that the machine could never get around their \\"gelcircuitry\\" -- was there no way else for them to construct an artificial brain? What exactly happened to Rayna in the 3rd book, or Raquella for that matter? Why did the Sorceresses have the powers that they did -- the Reverend Mothers of the later books didn't even have those powers? Omnius couldn't come up with a way to kill the humans better than an old fashioned plague with just a 40+% kill rate? 2) Some things were just stupid, and seemed to be put in just to add a \\"neat\\" factor (the little pirahna mites, for ex, are just silly). 3) The whole series was just too long, with too many characters and threads that didn't have to be followed at all, because they lead to nothing, or that were just followed in too much detail. These 1900 pages probably could have been cut to 1000 or so. It's suppose to be an epic, yes, but you don't make a good epic just by bloading it with boring and unnecessary content (the thread with the long-lost Titan Hecate could have been so good, but it led to almost nothing and was dull; and did we have to follow the sword fighters in the 3rd book at all?) 4) It didn't keep the same human characters thru the 3 books, and so it didn't have as strong of a thread as the first series. <br /> <br />     The first book in this trilogy (The Butlerian Jihad) was enjoyable, but then everything just got old, and the 2nd and 3rd books got boring, and I even skimmed some story lines. But... you do get to see if how Mentats, the Guild navigators, the Bene Gesserit, the Atreides/Harkonnen fued, etc., all got started, even if a couple of their beginnings seem contrived.  <br />
B00005JMK0|5.0|Anything with the Jeff Lynne influence does it for me... I have this film on VHS but the sound quality isn't all it might be. Considering this film came out around 1984, the computer featured isn't a lot different to todays machines... Great story, Great music, Great film!
B00006CXXU|4.0|Miss. Christina Aguilera has came along since her \\"Genie In The Bottle\\" days. She shows the world that she is not that person anymore that she is someone new. The other thing that she proved that her and Miss. Britney Spears is 2 different people. This is very different than her debut album. This is all about emotion and how she feels. The songs on this album ranges from a song that has a message to all the males \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" to the most heartfelt ballad that Christina has ever done \\"Beautiful.\\" What more could you ask for in this album. It talks about every topic that you could think of from abuse to loving yourself. There is some give and takes on this album but there is alot more takes than gives. The only thing that she could have done without was with the intro's. If there is one or two than fine but with 4 that is going overboard.  <br /> <br />1.) Stripped Intro 5/5 This one is alright to introduce the album. <br />2.) Can't Hold Us Down 5/5 <br />3.) Walk Away 3/5 <br />4.) Fighter 5/5 <br />5.) Primer Amer Interlude 1/5 Pointless <br />6.) Infatution 2/5 <br />7.) Loves Embrace Interlude 1/5 Another one that is pointless <br />8.) Loving Me 4 Me 4/5 <br />9.) Impossible 5/5 <br />10.) Underappreciated 5/5 <br />11.) Beautiful 5/5 <br />12.) Makeover 2/5 <br />13.) Cruz 4/5 <br />14.) Soar 3/5 <br />15.) Get Mine Get Yours 5/5 <br />16.) Dirrty 5/5 <br />17.)

B0006GVJEE|5.0|Fresh from the international success of La Femme Nikita, Luc Besson attempted to conquer America with Leon. Trimmed of a few minutes for a potentially uncomfortable scene involving a little girl proclaiming her love for a hitman and renamed The Professional, it became a bonafide hit that would pave the way for his magnum opus, The Fifth Element. Eventually, the European cut of the movie was released in North America with all of the excised footage intact. Now, Sony/Columbia has released it on a DVD for the third time with a few new extras.<br /><br />Sony/Columbia has released several copies of The Professional on DVD. This latest incarnation includes the Superbit version of the movie with optimum sound and picture quality and a whole new selection of extras celebrating its 10th anniversary. Also of note, this is Besson's European cut a.k.a. \\"version integrale.\\"<br /><br />On the first disc is a fact track, which allows one to watch the movie with running subtitles that display all sorts of factoids and interesting bits of trivia about the movie and the people that worked on it.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with a \\"10 Year Retrospective\\" featurette. There are new interviews with Portman and Reno who talk about how they got involved with the movie and their experiences working on it. The most glaring omission with this doc is the lack of involvement from the director or Gary Oldman.<br /><br />\\"Jean Reno: The Road to Leon\\" briefly examines the life and career of this talented actor. Reno speaks very eloquently about his character.<br /><br />\\"Natalie Portman: Starting Young\\" is a good interview with the young actress. There is footage of her audition that clearly shows how talented she was so early in life. Portman is as charming as ever and fans of hers will enjoy this extra.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|First of all, the Amazon.com review was really just something else. Why praise one great band by insulting others, like Interpol, the Rapture, and the Strokes? That aside, this album is another great addition to the new stream of dance friendly rock coming into the mainstream. 2004 was a good year commercially for indie music (an oxymoron?) as bands like Franz Ferdinand and The Killers increased their fanbase. But don't let bitter old-school fans dissuade you from picking up this album. The post-punk guitars blend well with the dance beats, as do the often pained crooning. Overall pretty good. A major flaw with it, however, is the lack of originality. Despite it merits, it doesnt really break any frontiers musically, although this isnt necessarily a bad thing.  <br /> <br />Buy it, or burn it, or steal it, or something. Cuz its good. <br /> <br />But don't go too crazy. <br /> <br />What a mixed message.

B00009UW0N|3.0|Ok, I have to give this a 3 based on the original film alone. I bought it(though not from amazon), as well as the previous DVD release of Halloween. However, this version of it loses points because of the travesty that has befallen this excitingly frightening film. In an attempt to \\"improve\\" the video quality, they have simultaneously drained the film of it's mistique. No longer does Michael Myers seem to materilize out of the darkness, now he simply steps out from behind the corner. Essentially, this version of the film falls prey to the idea that every nighttime scene should have a blue hint. The Shape (as Myers is also known) is no longer that, he is now just a guy in a blue-lit room. I recommend you buy the previous version, if you can still find it.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I think that Gavin Degraw's album titled Chariot is absouletly amazing. His lyrics are brillant and really make you listen to the meaning of \\"his story.\\" I can honestly say that I listen to the cd constantly and each time I leave with something new; a new emotion or outlook on life. I really like how you can relate to his lyrics which makes the experience much more personal. His ability to sing and write music amazes me and makes me really appreciate the beauty of music.
B00005JN0T|4.0|When I first heard they were going to make a movie based on Asimov's robot stories, I cringed. My fears proved partly justified. The robots in this movie seem to have an additional law that requires them to provide an excuse for a chase scene and/or special effects every five minutes, regardless of how it affects their obedience to the other laws. And the attempt by the hero to explain what is wrong with the Three Laws of Robotics is pretty dumb.<br /><br />But if you look past those kind of flaws, there is much that the movie does well. The questions it raises about the dangers of artificial intelligence are as thoughtful as Asimov's. The fears of job insecurity and many related aspects of human-robot relationships seem fairly realistic.<br /><br />The movie makes it clear why we ought to be suspicious of the Three Laws. They virtually require that the robots, if they become smarter than humans, take over and do whatever is needed to prevent humans from suffering harm. Given a sufficiently good definition of \\"harm\\", that might be good. But given the difficulty that humans have agreeing on what constitutes harm (e.g. whether inequality is worse than poverty or job insecurity) and the frequency with which software has bugs, I would assume the robots have a poor definition of harm until proven otherwise. It's probably safer to simply make artificial intelligences obedient instead.
0767817729|5.0|I was recently in a staff meeting where we had to share our all-time favorite movie. I am a movie-aholic and this is among my top five. Why? Not because most people drool over Kevin Costner (he doesn't do much for me, actually). It's because it is the only movie I've seen 30 or more times that can STILL make me cry as hard as I did the first time I saw it. Anthony Quinn is a film god and always will be, 'nuff said. As for Madeline Stowe, I just wish she would make more movies for she is truly an underrated (and undercast) gem. I don't buy into what critics and some other reviewers here apparently dislike. It is what it is ... violence and spousal abuse notwithstanding ... that's just part of the movie and I suppose, part of that culture. But as for a TRUE love story with a final scene that will make you boo hoo out loud, this one cannot be beat! Grab the Kleenex ...
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I bought this cd for my father as a Christmas present, but after watching Ray I borrowed it for myself. I am a sold Ray Charles fan and this cd did a great job covering his music.

0385510438|3.0|Before I started reading, The Last Juror sounded exciting. However, once I picked it up it was disappointing. The beginning of the book was good, but after the first 50 pages it was just frustrating. Grisham spends 60 pages telling us how Willie visits every church in his county, and how everyone is mad that Bargain City is coming to town. Almost half of the book was wasted on useless information, so I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a slow, uneventful read.
1400032717|3.0|Most of the reviews of this book concentrate on how empathetic the author is, and how he uses humor, and how he \\"gets it\\" about autism.  You could say as much about a very fine book report on autism; as a novel this work falls a bit short.<br /><br />The plotting involves a long sequence of initiatives from the main character, Christopher.  His family troubles are sad, his struggles are alternatively funny and intense.  You want to like this boy, you want him to succeed.  The reader also wishes to feel they have learned something about autism, such is the sadness of the struggle.  But then... I hesitate to be critical of a book so owned by the readers, but then you stop believing the story.<br /><br />Maybe the energy and relentless drive of Christopher stops being at all believable.  Perhaps the inevitable pathos of a lad caught between parents struggling with each other, with love... The book tries to create an irritation with Christopher that mirrors the irritation often felt when dealing with an autistic person.  But the irritation on my part came from the somewhat manipulative story telling of the author, and the sense that this story was a string of pearls, each smaller than the last, each vignette less believable.<br /><br />So I am less than totally enthused, and I predict that this book will fade over time, even though I feel for Christopher and for autistic persons.  It is the feeling that you are supposed to want to love this story that perhaps in the end drives one off the band wagon, a feeling that the author has positioned the reader too carefully, the story too artful... Maybe next time out for Mr. Haddon?  A story without a built in heart tug?
0897500482|5.0|One thing that struck me right away about Lee's approach in this book (as well as most of his others) is how he spends as much or maybe even more time discussing strategy and other advanced principles rather than specific techniques. This is because Lee expected those who read his books to at least have mastered the basics of blocking, punching, and kicking before trying to learn the more advanced technical and strategy principles.<br /><br />For example, although the chapter on \\"Tools,\\" in which he discusses the techniques, is 40 pages long, the chapter on \\"Qualities\\" is 38 pages, in which he discusses various principles like speed, power, timing, and so on, and the \\"Attack\\" chapter is 36 pages, which is 74 pages right there, and doesn't include the other similar chapters in the book.<br /><br />There is so much material here that it's hard to summarize, but I enjoyed many things about it, such as the little technical tips like, \\"The essence of any hook is that the striker raises his elbow at the last possible moment when swinging, to attack strategies, such as \\"Do not hurl yourself at your oponent, but gain and maintain distance in a calm and precise manner.\\" And also \\"Nothing bothers an adversary more than variety in both attack and defense.\\"<br /><br />The cover says that the book has sold over 750,000 copies in 9 languages, an interesting statistic. (I'm surprised it's not over a million). In addition to Lee's thoughts and notes on technique and advanced strategy, there is even an extensive illustration of grappling and ground techniques and holds and locks, an interesting technique area by itself that has gotten more attention in recent years. Bruce shows that he was ahead of his time in integrating this with JDK decades ago.<br /><br />Lee also makes the important point that in JKD there is almost no, if any, direct attack--they are all indirect after a feint or as a counter-punch or technique--but that requires the ability to draw out an opponent, out-maneuver him, and a scientific approach.<br /><br />Another nice technical point he makes is, \\"In all hand techniques, the hand moves first, proceding the foot. Keep this in mind--hand before foot--always.\\"<br /><br />I find this interesting in that in tai chi and some kung fu, the foot is expected to be just as fast as the hand and to move in synchrony with it--as difficult or as impossible as that may seem.<br /><br />Bruce Lee only wrote six books, but if there's a bible of JDK this is it, and is probably essential reading for any JKD or any other martial artist interested in Lee and his ideas and what made him so great.ch.

B000022TSY|2.0|Can somebody please explain to me how this awful movie became one of the signature movies of a generation?  Did this movie come out during a lull in full-length film productions?  Were there no other movies that had a decent story or camera work?  The cameraman appears to have seveal seizures during the filming, and apparently, Dennis Hopper was too strung out on coke to realize this during the editing process.  Also there appears to be a huge gap in the plot line--a lack of decent ideas and dialogue that doesn't make me laugh at it's pathetic attempt to be hip and/or serious.  There are only two things good about this movie: the soundtrack and the fact that this movie propelled Jack Nickolson's career.  Other than that, this movie should be burnt, or at least end up like the main characters do.    Hippie Pete
B0006399FS|4.0|If you're a huge U2 fan, buy the album.  Otherwise I'd recommend picking a few new good songs for your iPod. <br /> <br />I've been a U2 fan for 20 years, seen the band twice in concert and I own just about every DVD and CD they've come out with.  It took listening to the album 4 times end to end for me to grow an application for it. This isn't an album of concert classics like Rattle & Hum or The Joshua Tree.  You won't find Edge rocking out like he did in Achung baby and I'm sure the videos won't be as crazy as they were in Zooropa.  You'll find a few great riffs by the Edge and Bono's signature voice albeit much silenced from his days of singing One and Sunday Bloody Sunday. <br /> <br />Bono put it best when the band was interviewed in themid 1980's for their DVD - the Making of Joshua Tree. At that time he said The Joshua Tree expresses a melancholy pain which is uniquely Irish and that this is where the band's unique sound comes from.  The same melancholy mood is clear in Atomic Bomb, yet here over 70% of the songs revolve around themes of relationships and loves that have been lost.  As an evolution of the same emotional experience it will likely be popular with longtime fans.  Although its a hit for me, new listeners may find the pace of the album a bit boring - not to mention the current media blitz surrounding Vertigo making the headline song a bit overplayed. <br /> <br />I'd definitely recommend both of the DVD's the Making of Joshua Tree and Rattle & Hum to fans who'd like to see some of the behind the scenes action and great concert footage from the band during their rise to success!   <br /> <br />Its purely a testament to the Band's ingenuity and their marketing creativity that both Amazon.com and Apple reported that Atomic Bomb was the #1 selling album both in CD form and the #1 album downloaded from iTunes.com over the 2004/05 holiday season.  I'd venture to estimate that most of these sales were to longtime fans and were related to the new U2 iPODas opposed to conversions of new listeners to the fans base.  I'd anticipate that sales will taper off substantially domestically in 2005 even with the joint US and European tour kicking off soon.
B000641Z90|5.0|I own about 10 concert DVD's and this one is by far the best! I pre-ordered this one a month ago and received it 2 days after the release last week (great service amazon!). I have always liked Phil's music but I never realized how talented a vocalist and a musician he was until I watched this concert.  Phil, the band, the backup singers and the horn section all have great showmanship--you can see they had a great time playing this concert.  Showmanship + musicianship + great music = awesome concert. I have not yet found another DVD that includes 24 top 20 hits performed live plus the MTV videos to go with most of the hits.  All for $20! Plus a documentary about the tour that is well done.  That's alot of bang for your buck.  ONLY ONE BIT OF CRITICISM: for some reason I cannot get the DVD to pause on my Sony DVD player.  I've never had this problem with any other DVD. Has anybody else had this problem?
0767836324|3.0|Contrary to popular misconception, this is not another Peter Pan film. This is very much a \\"what if\\" film, based upon the premise of what would happen to a Peter Pan, so heavily dependent upon \\"never growing old\\", if he were to grow old and forget his past. It makes an interesting contrast to the oft-repeated Peter Pan story.  <br /> <br />Peter Banning (Robin Williams) is an obviously successful businessman, specializing in corporate hit and run raids it seems. In a depressingly common situation, he is slowly alienating his lovely wife Moira (Caroline Goodall) and children, due to his increasing obsession with his work. He also seems to be slowly forgetting his roots as an orphan, saved by Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith), the grandmother of his wife. So when he returns to England with his family to attend the dedication of a new wing at a children's hospital in Wendy's honour, he seems to be less focused on family than he should be. But he is shocked out of his monomania by the kidnapping of his children, by none other than Captain James Hook (Dustin Hoffman), and even more shocked when Wendy forces him to understand that he is actually the Peter Pan and that he has to go after the children. Slowly getting pickled on some alcoholic sustenance, he is further forced to confront his past when Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) arrives to drag him off to Never Neverland. No mean task for a guy who has forgotten everything about how he used to fly and why he did it anyway. Suffice it to say, he heads off to Never Neverland where the inevitable (less than successful) rekindling of relationships with Captain Hook and The Lost Boys takes place, with Tinkerbell and The Lost Boys taking on the task of trying to get Peter to remember everything about his past so that we can have the climatic battle between good and bad.  <br /> <br />As long as one approaches the film not expecting a retelling of the classic Peter Pan story, then I have always felt that this was a decent piece of familyfun, mixed with a decent dollop of good old family values. To return to it on DVD in all its widescreen glory is a delight after years of surviving on a rather mediocre VHS tape. There is obvious enthusiasm for the project from all concerned here, as the film moves along at a quite decent pace, despite its two hour plus length. The story could perhaps have been aided by a little judicious pruning here and there, but the cast have done a commendable job with what they were given to work with. Robin Williams is his usual sterlingly reliable self in the lead role, without going over the top - which would have been quite easy to do methinks. I have always found this a rather refreshingly different performance from Dustin Hoffman (he copped a Golden Globe nomination for it) and for some reason find him completely convincing as the Hook trying to recapture something that has long gone. The less said about Julia Roberts here the better, although it must have been difficult in a role where basically you would have been doing everything solo for insertion later into a shot. The highlight for me though is Bob Hoskins. Obviously the film is heavily based upon effects work at times, and to be honest the work is showing up its age a little now. However, it remains a rather decent piece of effects work overall. <br />
0156029065|4.0|First, let me say I enjoyed this book.  Anyone interested in the Byzantine era would enjoy some of the details woven through the narrative. <br />However, as I encountered in Foucault's Pendululm, there were sections that were a bit over the top for me. <br />Nevertheless, it was a good page turner, and the character of Baudolino was well thought out in my opinion.  Just his tale of how he got to be involved in the whole saga was well thought out...the elusive search for Prester John (and the associated twists and turns) was also very well done. <br />
0688170528|5.0|I probably would not have read this book if I'd really known what it was about as we had recently lost a child to suicide.  However, I am glad that I read it.  It was enormously healing to read about other families facing the same sort of loss.  The story was also well done.  I could completely understand why the main characters acted as they did and also see how tragically unnecessary it was.  Great book.  Nicely written, believeable characters.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|There are basically two ways, in my opinion, to divide up the quality of the enormous and expansive musical output of Eric Clapton.  If he is staying close to his blues-rock base, expanding on it while honoring its traditions or covering those traditions outright, the result is likely to be an excellent album and worthwhile addition to your collection.  If he decides to hire some hot-shot current producer and go modern pop, adding on multi-layered keyboards and arrangements that follow current market trends instead of instincts, the result is likely to be forgettable or embarassing.  It's always been that way for Eric...going all the way back to the Bluesbreakers' debut CD.  But these marvellous songs from Robert Johnson are the heart and soul of Eric's music...hell, they're the heart and soul of rock music, period.      Eric sounds revitalized and challenged, positively leaping into this music with unabandoned faith.  His vocals and guitar playing are top-notch throughout, and the whole band sounds as if they're having a boys-night-out.  Don't let terms like 'bloozak' fool you --- this stuff will consume you, and it's amazing if these songs haven't reached you already in one form of another.  For example, \\"Love In Vain\\" has reached a lot of rock listeners many times over by the Rolling Stones cover, but here, Eric makes the song his own with stinging slide guitar and assured vocals.  It's just one of many great moments on this CD.  Kudos to the guys in the band as well, that decorate this album with some of the nastiest ensemble playing heard to man for twenty years.  This is an all-around triumphant work, and millions of miles better than stuff like 'Pilgrim', 'Reptile', 'Unplugged', or some of the other dogs in Eric's catalog.  You'll hear the roots of Elvis' 'Sun Sessions', the Stones' 'Exile on Main Street', even Aerosmith's 'Rocks' with the songwriting of Robert Johnson.  And Eric isn't shy about acknowledging, in so many words in the liner notes, that when hegets a little too full of himself, this music and songwriting from the father of the blues is what brings him back to Earth and keeps him honest.    Now, c'mon Eric, it's time to make that follow-up to 'Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs' !  Perhaps you and Buddy Guy this time since Duane A., God rest his soul, is no longer with us.
B000002IKR|5.0|This is one of the greatest Thrash albums ever!! if your into early Metallica like Kill em All, this is the album for you. it starts off with Over the Wall, which i liked right away. all the songs were actually good. Burnt Offerings is a chilling song. But my favorite would have to be Alone in the Dark. and no this band is not a rip off Metallica as others like to call it. if your into 80,s Thrash, you MUST buy this!! and check out their 88 album. let Thrash live on!! id put Testament up there as one of my favorite Thrash bands!! METAL MILITIA!! \\"Slaughter of the innocent\\"
1878424319|1.0|A friend suggested this book. It did nothing for me at all and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The four things (agreements) mentioned do lead to personal freedom and wisdom I suppose, but so do things like \\"Never worry\\" or \\"Don't be embarrassed\\". I could make up more things that would be great if we didn't do it, and would lead to being happier. I'll call them agreements and publish them.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|You must have this for your collection, even if you only like the first one - the price is amazing. Part 3 is a movie you can watch over and over again, because it is so damn funny. Part 2 has a couple good parts, part 4 is garbage. They need to make a part 5 with Daniel back in it. Remember, Cobra Kai never dies!!!!!!!
B00031TXBI|5.0|this album is awesome!!! john is at the top of his game with this one, there's great lyrics, great guitar solos, distortion, his voice is excellent, every song is just amazing!

0679879269|5.0|Though of these three books I do love the first the most, this book is still amoung my favourites in the whole world. It is just as beautifully written, beautifully created and beautifully different as the other two. When I finished the last chapter I cried for nights before I could recover from not being able to read about Lyra any more.  <br /> <br />I know there are a lot of religeous people who find this book offensive but, as I said in my review on the Golden Compass-IT'S JUST A BOOK! The auther has his own views and you don't have to agree with them. These are my favourite books and I'm a Christian. It doesn't matter. People who hate this book also hate the Harry Potter books for the same reasons. Why is this? I do not know. I am also a huge fan of the Harry Potter books. Peole have to understand that just because something published states an opinion that they don't agree with doesn't mean they have to burn it or detest it because they are not being forced to share those opinions. Sure, if you are Christian, be warned before you read these, but I think there really is a message in these books if you block out the anti-religeon.  <br /> <br />The only flaws of the Amber Spyglass are that some of the parts with Mary are a bit boring, though that is only because the parts with Lyra and Will are so interesting, and that the auther maybe went a tiny bit overboard with the anti-religeon. The rest is perfect.  <br /> <br />I have read this book two or three times (I can't remember which) and gotten at least five friends hooked on the series. I think everyone should read these books. They are true litterature at its best.
B0002X314C|5.0|Dang, dang, dang!!!! <br /> <br />Talk about a good CD.  I am loving this to the point of forgetting what my darn name be, yall. <br /> <br />Git YALLS a copy right away, cuz this cut is the BADDDEST mack in a long OLDIE-inspired time. <br /> <br />Getdown/Getdown <br /> <br />GET IT! <br />
158799190X|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read about human behavior and probability.  This book crystallizes many of the reasons behind why we humans behave the way we do despite knowing the odds intellectually and offers some very pragmatic ideas for minimizing our irrational behavior. <br /> <br />In addition to his insights on probability, Dr. Taleb seems to have a firm understanding of how to teach.  I'll never forget the  visceral images his book left me with, such as Odysseus and the sirens or the experiences of his friend Nero.  I know little about the markets, but I can see what a powerful training ground in probability they must be.  The descriptions of traders \\"blowing up\\" are good allegories even though I find myself in a less random environment (I think).
B0006IUDXA|1.0|I've waited, as have other Macgyver fans, for so long for the first season (my favorite season by the way) to come out on DVD. Yes, I finally have my favorite episodes together, but it's sad that Paramount released it like this. Looking at the box art, you feel that some college student produced it from his dorm room. I can even look past the fact that there are no special features. What I can't look past is that there are no original air dates. Every television show I have on DVD has at least the original air dates. The navigation menus offer no motion or music, something I've never seen done to any DVD. Again, Macgyver will always be one of my favorite all time shows. Too bad, it gets such poor DVD treatment.
0385510438|5.0|Not the expected legal thriller with yet another lawyer as the protagonist, THE LAST JUROR is instead a beautifully-written bird's eye view of life in a small Southern town during the 1970's.  Instead of a lawyer, the leading character is a young man named Willie Traynor who buys the town's failing newspaper shortly before a brutal rape-murder takes place, forever changing life in Clanton, Mississippi (where Grisham's first novel, A TIME TO KILL, took place).  Willie surprises even himself when he becomes a crusading journalist determined to do everything humanly possible to see a brutal murderer convicted and locked up for life.<br /><br />This story not only taught me a lot about life in the South, but also described the ideal journalist, someone willing to put truth and integrity before his own personal safety.  Not exactly a \\"thriller\\" like so many of Grisham's earlier books, but a fascinating and thought-provoking story.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|Sky Captain was really a disapointing movie, the visuals were cool, the demurred color scheme, the captured streamlined look of the 1930's was superbly captured, and Gweneth P. was particularly hot in this movie, but that was about it. I lack the ability to see airplanes that double as submarines, and ray guns that fire metal melting smoke rings. Nothing special about this movie other than its ability to be overly disapointing.
B00062IDCO|5.0|This is it.  The final season of Star Trek: Voyager.  With Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and The Next Generation, the later seasons suffered a little bit in the writing areas due to the writers moving to a new show.  Voyager did not have this problem since \\"Enterprise\\" didn't premiere until the fall AFTER Voyager ended.  The Seventh season employs some of the best writing and storytelling of the entire series.  The finale is a great episode, but not perfect.  There are two multi-part stories in this season that are absolutely superb.  Voyager couldn't go out without bringing back the saboteur Seska for a final hurrah.  Dwight Schultz reprises his role as Barclay again, and Marina Sirtis makes an appearance.  The Doctor makes a controvertial holonovel.  Harry Kim takes his first command and Q returns again.  Another great season.  Highly recommend it to Star Trek fans and others alike. <br /> <br />Best Episodes: <br /> <br />Unimatrix Zero: Part II, Imperfection, Drive, Repression, Critical Care, Inside Man, Nightingale, Flesh and Blood, Shattered, Workforce: Parts I and II, Human Error, Q2, Author Author, Homestead, Renaissance Man, Engame
B00003CX5P|1.0|this is just another ploy by george lucas to make money off of a failed movie, don't get me wrong i love star wars, but i'm not the biggest fan of the new ones, ESPICALLY episode 1, the hype was so big for this movie and i believe that lucas defiantly failed to deliever. Now he's trying re-release this movie, what's new about it, widescreen format and a few new documentaries with the same footage used in other documentaries about the movie that you could probably see on cable tv. <br /> <br />In my opinion just another attempt to make money, is this really worth another $20 dollars to you?
B00005JXY3|1.0|The year was 1986, two years after the megasmash \\"Karate Kid\\".  Millions were waiting for the continuing exploits of Daniel and Mr. Miyagi, and filmmakers were only too happy to oblige with a sequel that continued many of the themes of the first movie, while introducing many more.  What they created was a beautiful film, rich in character and nuance, with tears, laughs, and classic lines galore.  They created something special that would stand the test of time. <br />  <br />Then they did the motion picture equivalent of wadding up the sheet of paper and throwing it in the garbage. <br />  <br />I'm speaking, as you've no doubt guessed by now, of their decision to add the Traitor Cetera ballad \\"Glory of Love\\" as the movie's theme song.  Why the filmmakers chose to go this route instead of asking the still-powerful Chicago to contribute is a question that I have spent many hours puzzling over; I'm sure many of the series' fans have as well.  Either way, Cetera's song stands as a blatant attempt to recall his earlier, better, iconic work with Chicago.  It's as if he spends the entire song apologizing for making the worst decision in rock music hstory.  Frankly, the tune's grandstanding mediocreness casts such a pall over the movie that it never sufficiently recovers.  I've only watched it once since I saw it in the theater. <br />  <br />Anyway, what might have been a classic became a footnote in the grand history of the \\"Karate Kid\\" series.  I'll always mourn what might have been with \\"Karate Kid II\\" - but I'll never let Cetera ruin the grand rush of joy I get from the original film, part III, and \\"Next\\". <br />  <br />Hey, Columbia/Tristar!  Isn't the time right for a Cetera-less special edition!  I know I'd buy it!
158799190X|5.0|This is a very good book for the right target audience - traders who successfully speculate with their own funds.  There aren't many of them, estimates rarely go above 10,000 worldwide.  Small wonder then, that the publisher chooses to market the book on a larger scale, and that's where it gets misunderstood. <br /> <br />Not that that's difficult.  Taleb has a rare clarity of thought, but not of expression.  There are a few brilliant insights almost lost in the wordy mix of bitterness and triumphalism that makes up most of the book.  These insights are well worth the price and the time spent extracting them, but they will be lost on most people who buy this book.  Unless one is able to filter Taleb's text through the prism of one's own experience it won't make sense. <br /> <br />If you are not a trader, don't bother with this book - there are better texts on epistemology as well as statistics. <br /> <br />If you are a trader who is still learning, buy this book, read it once, keep it on the shelf, and read it again in a few years. <br /> <br />If you are a consistently profitable trader with someone else's money, buy this book and read it to better understand your own decisionmaking process before you consider becoming self-employed. <br /> <br />If you are a consistently profitable trader with your own money, buy the book and read it - it won't improve your trading but it will improve your execution, and it's worth the money for that.
B000003TAR|5.0|Close to every single review I have read.. they're all senseless and stupid. If some of you truly wrote that.. go back to school.. I mean how in the hell do you manage to walk? breathe or even eat? You are all retarded. In Utero may possibly be one of the greats.. of all time. Sure there are some others.. but you guys are all asses because you're so retarded. In Utero was indeed Grunge.. some of the bands I've seen listed make me hurl. Go back to school.. and take some serious music lessons because you all suck.
B00005JKHP|4.0|Some may consider it just as easy (or difficult) a task to talk about one particular ingredient of a recipe while simultaneously trying to avoid talking about at least one of the others. \\"Star Trek - The Motion Picture (The Director's Edition)\\" is a 2000 version of the Robert Wise-directed 1979 movie of what would become Paramount Pictures' extremely lucrative \\"Star Trek\\" franchise.  <br /> <br />Ten years after the cancellation of the original Desilu-made 1966-69 NBC television series of the same name, which had seen 79 episodes of Gene Roddenberry's \\"Wagon Train to the Stars\\" (not a title, just the idea), the original cast of the series assembles to take their space vessel, the USS \\"Enterprise\\", out of a space dock orbiting Earth  to intercept and deal with the greatest threat the home planet of the United Federation of Planets is facing - an alien entity which has already destroyed three Klingon cruisers and the space station, Epsilon IX, which first made the Federation aware of the \\"cloud\\". <br /> <br />Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) makes his presence known in a way that contrasts with his demeanor during the series. He effectively usurps the \\"untried captain\\", Will Decker (Stephen Collins), in a scene in the engineering section that looks as if it might have become a fistfight if this had been in the Old West in the 1880s. Kirk stamps his authority, thus creating the possibility of conflict, yet Decker acts the professional at all times, realizing that Kirk is the right man for the job. That, however, is totally lost on the captain, who says to him: \\"Stop ... competing with me, Decker!\\" The executive officer, however, retains his composure and lays it on the line regarding his captain's total lack of recent experience of starship command. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), the ship's surgeon, also effectively condemns his captain and old friend's irrational behavior, yet the man does have a job to do and he is determined to carry it through. <br /> <br/>Conflict is no stranger to \\"Star Trek\\", though, as far as \\"ST-TMP\\" goes, this brief interaction is the only instance of conflict, a far cry from when McCoy and Science Officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy) used to be verbal sparring partners in the TV series. Spock himself comes to the ship even more lacking in emotion than he used to be after undergoing the harsh discipline of \\"Kolinahr\\" on his home planet of Vulcan, and almost alienates (no pun intended) his fellow crew-members. Yet it seems that the \\"cloud\\", referred to as \\"V'Ger\\" by a probe sent to the ship in the form of the (former) navigator Ilia (the late Persis Khambatta, who died in 1998 aged only 49), has one thing in common with the Vulcan: a feeling of being incomplete and wanting to find answers to unanswered questions of existence and being. <br /> <br />The Director's Edition includes commentary by director Robert Wise, special effects director Doug Trumbull, legendary composer Jerry Goldsmith (whose theme to this movie became that for the \\"Next Generation\\" TV series from 1987 to 1994) and actor Stephen Collins. Their commentary focuses purely on the technical aspects of the making of the movie, which included some new, albeit brief scenes (such as a fireball just vanishing in front of the \\"Enterprise\\" after Spock sends the friendship message to V'Ger) and excluded some others (such as Ilia's reference to homo sapiens as \\"a sexually immature species\\", a deletion that I personally disagree with, since it just about summed up what Deltans like Ilia think of humans). <br /> <br />I would have liked Collins to have talked (or at least have had the opportunity to talk) about the chemistry between the members of the cast, both old and new, yet he, like the other three, confines himself largely to the technical side of things. He does, however, make references to Khambatta when talking about the penultimate scene when Kirk, Decker, Spock, McCoy and the Ilia-probe make contact with what V'Ger actually is. <br /> <br />Wise admits that the action of the original 1979 offering, which was finished in rather a hurry before the Christmas box office release in the USA, was too long in places, yet, as Nimoy pointed out in his (second) autobiography, \\"I Am Spock\\" (1995), the feeling was that Paramount \\"was doing something historic and important\\". As a result of what was perceived to be an over-reliance on the importance of the original TV series, 400 of whose fans were gathered in uniform in the scene where Kirk tells them about the danger, only to be horrified at what the alien entity then does to the Epsilon IX station, there was a tendency to sacrifice action and pace in favor of something resembling Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" (1968). <br /> <br />Fortunately for Paramount, the movie did quite well at the box-office if only because of the significance of \\"Star Trek\\". Had the movie been a one-off, just as \\"Alien\\" was when it was released the same year, it would undoubtedly have bombed and been consigned to sci-fi history. As it so happened, \\"the human adventure [was] just beginning\\". The movie is not \\"where no man has gone before\\", but, like \\"Alien\\" and \\"2001\\", it is still a worthy piece of cinematic sci-fi that has endured. <br />
B0001ADAVK|5.0|mona lisa smile was a pretty good movie. that has alot of great actresses.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|The opening music to this film would not be out of place in any American Saturday morning serial, which were very popular in movie theaters in the 1930s, since this most famous of propaganda films was made contemporaneously. Like those serials, words only appear for about a minute after the opening title, words which \\"remind\\" the German-speaking audience of events which were only too familiar to them at the time: that the Great War had begun only 20 years before, that Germany's \\"suffering\\" had begun 16 years before and that Germany's \\"rebirth\\" had begun a mere 19 months before. <br /> <br />The \\"rebirth\\" alluded to the coming of power of the film's main attraction, Hitler, who presided over the Sixth Congress of the National Socialist German Workers' Party which took place in the historic city of Nuremberg between September 4 and 10, 1934. Though Hitler had been in supreme power for only a few weeks after the death of former army chief of staff, President von Hindenburg (1847-1934), it is made abundantly clear just what affection most people seen in the film had for this man. The scenes of cheering civilians lining the streets as the Fuhrer was driven to his hotel are quite thought-provoking, given that it is all too easy to remember what Hitler really intended for the German people in spite of his very public orations, in which he emphasized strength and unity of \\"all\\", even if certain minorities were, of course, never meant to be included. <br /> <br />Seven decades have now passed since Riefenstahl and her staff captured this propaganda event on film, and the film has served as a testament to how a people was collectively ready to embrace an ideology and its leader, since both it and he had brought them to a stage in their nation's history where they could show the world just how strong Germany had become just 16 years after the end of the Great War, after which the victorious Allies had extracted an extremely high price for Germany's aggressive foreign policies.<br /> <br />Now that Hitler was the supreme ruler, he meant to take Germany forward in a way that would mean that all Germans would be made responsible for their part. An indication of just how many people were supposed to be involved in all this can be gained from the scenes involving the Hitler Youth and other youth organizations (see the thousands of tents lined up in hundreds of rows, as seen from the air), the Reich Labor Service men bearing their spades and stating where in Germany they hailed from, and, of course, the thousands of storm-troopers and army soldiers, who filled the stadium to hear Hitler's speeches. <br /> <br />Even here, Hitler's power as an orator is clear. He shines over everybody else, as he makes his impassioned speeches, reminding his audience of where they have been, where they are now, what they must do to continue to make Germany strong, and where Germany is heading. At one point, deputy Fuhrer Rudolf Hess proclaims that Hitler is the \\"guarantor of peace\\", yet that seems utterly incongruous when he immediately leads the assemblage into shouting \\"Sieg Heil!\\" no less than three times before Hitler steps onto the podium. Once Hitler has finished and Hess steps back on, it is clear that the audience is rapt and that, for a moment, Hess himself is speechless and hesitant, conveying the idea that, as a speaker, nobody could remotely touch Hitler. <br /> <br />Even in 1934, Hitler's society is very much a military-industrial machine, although agrarian society is represented in the film, as men, women and children from the countryside are seen in traditional rural costumes, some of whom are presented to Hitler himself. However, the brevity of the screen time on their part indicates just how minor agriculture played in the scheme of things in Nazi Germany. If anything, the uniformed storm-troopers, SS men and army soldiers marching past Hitler's staff car in front of the Church of Our Lady in the centre of the historic city of Nuremberg serveto remind the audience of just how military-oriented Germany was even at that time. <br /> <br />Whatever people may think of Riefenstahl as a film-maker, the fact was that she had a brief to cover as many aspects of the congress and its participants as possible, including aspects not immediately relevant, such as Nuremberg's historic architecture. The power of her finished product indicates that she was successful in doing what she had been briefed to do, and this is all the more remarkable, considering that women in Nazi society were largely encouraged to be homemakers and mothers, whereas Riefenstahl, a woman, had been given such a high responsibility to document the most important political event in Germany in 1934. <br /> <br />Whether she was a fervent Nazi or a dispassionate observer, depending on one's point of view, Riefenstahl produced a film that can hardly fail to make people open their eyes to just how much influence the Nazi Party had in a country which could boast Beethoven, Brahms, Bach, Goethe, Schiller, Gutenberg, Kant, the brothers Grimm and Wagner amongst its most distinguished cultural and literary figures. Whether those images, which have endured seven decades and will continue to do so as long as Nazi Germany, as an entity, continues to remain within the public consciousness, can be seen as glorifying Nazism or, at the very least, as \\"showing the highlights\\" of the Congress, will also be subject to one's own viewpoint.  <br /> <br />Riefenstahl, who died in September 2003 aged 101, would always claim that she was \\"mesmerized\\" by Hitler and the Nazis, but that she was always a film-maker who made esthetics, rather than purely content, a primary concern. (She even released a film about underwater photography when she was 100 years old.) Nevertheless, \\"Triumph of the Will\\" (for which Riefenstahl won the gold medal at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1937, although the film itself is allegedly still banned in Germany even today) should serve as alesson as to what happens when a people follows one person in what appears to be blind faith. <br />
B000001GQB|4.0|These are probably the best examples of \\"big-band\\" Mozart.  The tempos are slow, but Boehm's rhythms are sprightly, so they maintain their forward flow.  The \\"Linz\\" symphony comes off especially well -- easily the best recording of this symphony I've ever heard.  My biggest complaint is that Boehm consistently ignores repeats -- a common practice at that time -- which hurts the \\"Jupiter\\" symphony especially.  To the reviewer below, it's not quite right to say these aren't complete performances, but I withheld the fifth star mainly because of the skipped repeats.  (Taking them would have forced this set to spill onto three discs, but it would have been worth the additional cost.  Since the CD had yet to be invented when these recordings were made, of course, this obviously wasn't a consideration.)  Overall, this set is well worth having, especially if you already have period or period-style recordings.      Also try the Double Decca set of Benjamin Britten conducting 25, 29, 38, and 40, along with the Serenata Notturna.
B0002X314C|5.0|Wow. This album is great. End of discussion. There are obviously parts of it that vary a little, but that variation is so forgivable when presented with this piece as a whole. John Legend's (John Stephens) lyrics are great and mostly concern relationships, although sometimes lean toward things more spiritual (i.e. God). But what's more spiritual than a relationship? Legend's voice is excellent - his pitch is accurate and has little flaws vocally.  His pseudonym might have been adopted to lend to a 'legendary' status pun - one which I won't give him.  That being said, he's a great artist.  <BR>For a debut album, 'Get Lifted' is tight and produced well, mostly by Kanye West, but doesn't sound too 'Kanye West-ish', apart from one track.  <BR>Overall, a great album and certainly one that should hopefully get the recognition it deserves.  Though only a month into the year, it's safe to say this will end up on my top cds of 2005.
0671015206|4.0|Much of what is said in this book should be fairly intuitive to most.  <br /> <br />The authors explain that millionaires tend to be first generation wealthy, very frugal, and self-employed. The book also goes on to describe where they live, what they drive, how much they spend on various consumer goods, whether they're married or not, the number of children they have, etc. <br /> <br />Although the data presented is interesting, it does not paint an entirely convincing picture of the factors that make a millionaire. The fact that millionaires are usually self-employed, or married, or drive chevys does not explain the millions of self-employed or married individuals, or those that drive chevys that are NOT millionaires.  <br /> <br />It would have been interesting if the authors had gone into the data in more depth. That being said, I do think it's a worthwhile read, and do recommend it.
B00005JNEW|2.0|I have to say I was very disappointed by this movie. I felt the character development of the players was poor. I was thinking to myself \\"do I care if these guys win or not?\\"...who are they? Secondly, the shaky video cam movement gets rather annoying. There were some nice football play-shots, but does not overcome the shortcomings of this movie.
0385510454|4.0|I suspect that Grisham had numerous pleasurable experiences researching this book, which largely takes place in Italy.  He writes his story describing many fine Italian restaurants and must have spent many days in the Italian countryside.  The story line is interesting, but could have been \\"juiced up\\" a bit more.  With professional killers looking to do \\"Marco\\" harm, he avoided even a glancing bullet to his body.  I appreciated the fact that he developed an interesting work of fiction without using vulgarity. I wasn't real keen on all the Italian sentences he used, but he followed up with the meaning of each sentence.  Grisham left the door open for a follow up, should he want to go back to Italy, for a sequal.  All in all, The Broker was an easy book to read, and well worth the hours it takes to get through its pages.
B000003TA4|5.0|The person who wrote that bad review about Kurt Cobain is a clown with a capital C. That is why his name is Corcky. By the way, I read your other reviews. As much as I like Pearl Jam Binaural is not a five star album. Also I would take Nirvana over Pearl Jam anyday. Pearl Jam haven't exactly made ground breaking albums since 1994. I think If Kurt Cobain was alive he would have made many more incredible albums. I would take Nevermind and In Utero anyday over any Pearl Jam albums. Again I am a huge Pearl Jam fan, but I think Nirvana was much better when they were around. I am bored of all Nirvana albums because I have listened to them so many times since 1995. But, for a new music fan these albums are essential for the 90's. When I first listened to these albums I was blown away. I can't really say that about many other albums. Artists today can take a lesson or two from a band like Nirvana. They were original and that is what made them so great. Love them or hate them their is no denying the talent of a lead singer like Kurt Cobain. I feel bad for the kids today cause most of the music sucks. I do like bands like Linkin Park, but most bands today don't have the emotion and heart like a band like Nirvana. I really feel Kurt Cobain was like our Lennon of the 90's. I also love the Beatles too. Kurt Cobain never got the chance to put out a huge body of work to prove himself. Check out a band called Bright Eyes. I saw them in concert a few days ago. I can't believe how much heart and talent this 24 year old lead singer has(Conor Oberst). At the end of the show he smashed his equipment. He also sang an anti-Bush song with so much passion I thought it was the early 90's. My friends think it's sad, but I like bands like Good Charlotte and New Found Glory, but they truly lack that rock star passion. If you disagree with me you simply  weren't old enough in the early 90's to experience the music. Like I said go to a Bright Eyes concert and you will see pure talent, heart, andpassion. Something that most bands today don't display.
B00063EMJ6|4.0|Listening to this overview just whets my appetite for the long awaited Neil Young boxed set. Although all of the songs are classic Neil songs, they are the ones that are the most popular and not necessarily the very best (although Cinnamon Girl and Like a Hurricane are definitely among the very best NY tunes ever recorded). <br /> <br />I love the cover. It made me want to pull out an old pair of patched jeans and the most baggy, faded flannel shirt that I can find.  <br /> <br />Part of Neil's genius is that he can effortlessly glide from grungy energetic rock to acoustic simplicity and the cd shows this (it's quite a juxtaposition going from \\"Comes a Time\\" to \\"Hey Hey My My\\" on a cd track). Alot of my favorite NY tunes are <br />missing (Human Highway, Albuquerque, Roll Another Number, Tell Me Why, acoustic My My Hey Hey, Mansion on the Hill,etc.) and I consider these songs <br />to be better songs then some of the ones that are included in the package (Harvest Moon, Southern Man, for example). <br /> <br />I would prefer to see a Very Best of collection based on artistic merit and not necessarily popularity (although the 2 <br />aren't necessarily mutually exclusive as I mentioned with Cinnamon Girl, for instance). Hopefully more selections would be included from \\"Tonights the Night\\", \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\", \\"Ragged Glory\\", \\"Harvest Moon\\" (I don't think \\"Harvest Moon\\" is the best tune on that cd).  <br /> <br />You can't really go wrong buying this cd, but a majority of the songs are already on \\"Decade\\" if you already own that one.  <br />I agree with the fact that none of the mid 80s experimental  <br />Geffen cds are represented here as that represented a desultory phase of Neil's career.
B000000W5L|1.0|I do not understand the enthusiasm for this collection of crappy tunes. This is The Stones at their worst. Skip it.
B00008FROE|5.0|This cd is a sludge filled masterpiece. It has a ragged, raw, almost \\"outtake\\" quality and it is unpolished inspiration in the vein of Neil Young's \\"Tonight the Night\\". This is the pinnacle of the Stones' run of 3 incredible albums (Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main St) from 1969 to 1972. <br /> <br />I remember vividly the Stones' 1972 Tour when they played alot of tunes from this double album set (Keith Richards sitting on a stool picking the opening acoustic guitar lines to \\"Sweet Virginia\\"). <br /> <br />The unpolished sludgy blend of black Gospel, blues, and rock is far superior to the bloated commercialism that would mar their later albums. The music comes off as inspired, loose, and free as if they were just letting themselves just go. The music is also enhanced by a great use of piano, organ, and saxophone by sidemen Nicky Hopkins, Billy Preston, and Bobby Keyes. \\"Rip This Joint\\" and \\"Rocks Off\\" are 2 of the most energetic rock songs ever recorded.    <br />
1592400876|4.0|Listen, if you need help with punctuation, you probably need a big text book and several hours of serious study. No small, large print book will do the trick. However, if you want to brush up on a few things and smooth some rough edges, this book helps. The author is quite energetic and over-zealous about punctation (commas, colons, etc.) and its proper use; don't let that scare you off. It is filled with several quick lessons and facts that bring the whole puntuation picture together, piece by piece. It is a quick read and a fun one too. It is not the Bible of english grammar or punctuation, but what is? (i.e. everyone is in disagreement, everywhere)     If you want to quickly brush-up and move on, read it. If you want to be over-zealous yourself, write your own book.
B000002UAX|5.0|The \\"masterpiece\\" label, trite and overdone as it is for this album, does apply to this effort. I love this cd because it chronicles the evolution of the <br />Beatles (that started with Revolver and Rubber Soul) from a lively mop top pop group into a group with a compelling creative force and vision. There are hits and misses here, but all great artistic efforts are characterized by leaps forward and some miscues.  <br /> <br />A fundamental rock and folk-rock sound underlies this album, and it was a shift from the more surreal, psychedelic effort of <br />Sgt. Pepper. The Beatles were forging past a more pretentious, bloated sound a la Iron Butterfly and were going in a more  <br />straightforward folk-rock-pop direction. They were leaving their peers behind (once again) with this effort. <br /> <br />It's definitely the most eclectic and interesting Beatles album. <br />The eclectism is represented by a wide variety of styles as <br />evidenced by Julia, Helter Skelter, Rocky Raccoon, Yer Blues, Sexie Sadie, etc. There are some pretentious experimental moments such as \\"Revolution Number 9\\" and \\"Good Night\\", but <br />they are still interesting songs. Again, it is a nice signpost <br />of the Beatles' musical evolution and how they were pushing creative boundaries past the peers of thier day.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I heard Luhrman say that \\"All I Want is You\\" (Carly Simon) was going to have a major role before they discovered \\"Come What May\\". I don't know why I find that so interesting.  <br /> <br />Anyway, this is lovely movie.
6303402348|5.0|Once in a great while, a movie comes along that captures your heart and imagination.  Forrest Gump is one of those rare movies.  Led by an all-star cast including Tom Hanks (Forrest), Robin Wright Penn (Jenny), Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan), and Sally Field (Mrs. Gump), the viewer is treated to a view of Americana through the eyes of a simple young country boy. <br /> <br />Through three turbulent decades, the movie describes events that were capturing headlines throughout the United States, as told through Forrest's eyes.  The viewer gets a unique look at such events as racial segregation, physical disability, war protests, and the onset of AIDS.  Through Forrest's unique perspective, the viewer is shown each of these controversial topics. <br /> <br />The viewer also gets to see the ups and downs of Forrest's relationship with Jenny over the years.  From young children riding a school bus together to facing the uncertainty of AIDS, a lifelong bond is shared between them. Although leading very different lives, Forrest's love for Jenny never waivers, and in the end, Jenny finally realizes that she is ment to be with Forrest. <br /> <br />The scenes in Vietnam are some of my favorites.  Gary Sinese's portrayal of Lt. Dan Taylor is simply perfect.  A by-the-book soldier who teaches Forrest how to stay alive, it is ultimately Forrest who saves Lt. Dan's life (over his protests) during an enemy ambush.  Forced to have both legs amputated, Lt. Dan slips into a life of alcohol and self-doubt, but Forrest remains his true friend, and after buying a shrimping boat, Lt. Dan joins Forrest as his \\"first mate\\".  It is here that Lt. Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life. <br /> <br />The most touching scene of the movie is near the end where Forrest is speaking to Jenny at her gravesite.  Forrest tells Jenny how much he loves and misses her, all the while gently crying.  He also explains to her how proud he is of their son Forrest Jr.  In the end, Forrest and Forrest Jr. are waiting for the school bus, just like Forrest and his mother used to. <br /> <br />I would give this movie six stars if I could.  Tom Hanks won an academy award for his portrayal of Forrest, while Robert Zemeckis also won for best director.  Simply put, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The acting is impeccable, and the viewer gets an interesting history lesson about life in the United States during the 60s, 70s, and early 80s.  I give this film my highest recommendation.  I guarantee that you won't have a dry eye after watching it.
0312995423|4.0|If the NSA has a guardian to prevent malicious code from getting into their vaunted multiprocessing code breaking computer, wouldn't they also have guardian block whatever might get out to other NSA systems? Especially, if a manager can bypass the guardian and allow the code to get in! Wouldn't this be a safeguard needed on a computer system that cost billions of dollars to build? This is one example of minor things that nagged at me after reading this novel. <br /> <br />That being said, while I was reading \\"Digital Fortress\\", I didn't take the time to ponder these questions because I was on a wonderful roller coaster ride of a story. The reader will find it very, very hard to put down this novel. I read \\"Digital Fortress\\" in one evening, finally going to bed at 2am. <br /> <br />Some of the characters needed to be fleshed out in this novel. Like the Langdon novels, Susan Fletcher, Dave Becker and the NSA Crypto team need to be revisited in future novels. And, the author needs to drop the mysterious assassin with one name that appear frequently in his novels (Hulahot in \\"Digital Fortress\\", Hassassin in \\"Angels & Demons\\" and Silas in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\") -- it's been repeated too much.
0764574124|5.0|I bought this book because of good reviews, and was quite pleased. I have some of a background in programming (decent at PERL, a tiny bit of visual basic), but had never done it in excel.<br /><br />I wanted to learn VBA for excel to automate my data analysis for a psychology experiment I am running. I knew that the actual program I would need to write would be fairly simple (just some contingent branching that averages response times for like responses together), but I needed to know the way to reference everything for excel and excel objects. In under two days (and 150 pages of this book), I was able to write the necessary code.<br /><br />Dummies books are usually good, and this one is great for ease of reading and clarity and organization.
B000001Y5X|5.0|This is Marilyns best all around album. <br />It's not as new and clean as recent albums. <br />If this isn't his best all around I'd vote for Golden Age.
B000002G7E|5.0|What can one say? Its the VU. I love this album, I throw it on for background when Im feeling creative. Making a rubber stamp, painting, scribbling, writing, whatever. Armed w/ coffee. cigarettes and this record you can do no wrong. Short songs in-between longer experiments that are still varied enough to keep interest.  There's lots of talk bout the greatness of \\"Sister Ray\\" and its all true, but lots not forget the fervor of the shorties. \\"White Light/White Heat\\" and \\"Here she comes now\\" rank as two of my favorite VU songs. The explosivity of the album from the beginning puts a smile on my face til its conclusion.
B00000I8UK|5.0|Well, I'm afraid there aren't just enough stars for this one. It is my favourite right alongside Contrane's spiritual experience (A love supreme). 1964 was an excelent year for new discoveries. A turning point.  <br />What can I say about \\"Out to lunch\\"?. It is about feeling, passion, rage, love, hatred... When I listen to it, I rediscover the wonder of life. It's not just music - It is a journey into knowledge. <br />Although I don't like to label music in any type - specially this craft work - I tend to agree with some of the reviews on this site. <br />It looks as free jazz, but it's not. I mean, I still don't really get the Ornette Coleman thing. It's got something powerful but something's missing. I thought it lacked something logical, but it wasn't that. After listening a couple of times \\"Out to Lunch\\" (just to mention the name and I feel ... wow!) I understood it lacked some kind of spiritual power that binded the players together. Dolphy and friends bridged that problem with some sort of magic approach. And the result is overwhelming. <br />I like specially Hutcherson (vibes) and Williams (drums) here. I just can't believe that Tony was just 18. My world!. And what about Dolphy?. He's just out of reach. Truly awesome!. <br />You can surely note Mingus influence on this CD, specially on the beautiful \\"Something sweet, something tender\\". Of course, he also recalls Monk on the first track and I can see some Coltrane approach on \\"Gazelloni\\" (good choice with the flute there). <br />I don't know why the bass clarinet is an instrument so neglected in modern jazz. On the first two tracks you can't conceive how an instrument could pass on so much. Specially if is played by a music genius called Eric Dolphy. <br />Only after having \\"Out to lunch\\" in your CD changer, you can start talking about music. So if you miss it, then I blame you!.
0385247125|4.0|For about a month now, I have been reading a book called Moonwalk. This is an autobiography written by the moonwalker himself, Michael Jackson. This book is about his rise to fame. It starts out about him as a little kid just trying to be in the Jackson five. This it ventures to the Jackson five before they made it big trying to do as may gigs as they can. Later on it goes on to his teenager years when Michael was going through a tough time of puberty and bad acne. And later it goes on about Michael's music and his struggle to make the perfect album. Did he make the perfect album you ask? And if he did, how many great albums did he make? Well if you want to know that, I suggest you read this terrific book and find out yourself <br /> I have a so-so opinion on this book. It was a cool book being that it was Michael Jackson and that I love him (not in a gay way of course). And in being that I read this book not because it was written well, but because it was about my idol Michael Jackson. Now don't get me wrong. This was not a horribly written book. It was ok for a first time writer. Maybe if he was a real writer, maybe it would have been written better because, he could probably explain himself better and put sentences better together. But because of this he doesn't explain situations as well as he could. But there are some positives from all this work. This book does some good for me because it talks from a first person experience. This means it's his experiences so he has the best knowledge of it and can explain exactly how he felt. So, all in all, this was an ok book and I would recommend this to anyone who loves Michael Jackson like me (again of course not in a gay way <br />
0790729369|2.0|This is a nice DVD, if you don't mind that 27.9 percent of the original theatrical image has been removed for the DVD exhibition, so that the DVD image fills your entire 4:3 television screen (theatrical aspect ratio - 1.85:1; DVD aspect ratio - 4:3).  If you're okay with that, enjoy!
B0002X314C|5.0|I knew that John Legend had talent when I first heard his voice and this CD proves it!  He's not just singing about one thing (sex) and that's refreshing within itself!  He has an old-school flava to him and that's what most of these new-school singers are lacking these days!  It's nice to know that there are some good singers out there who aren't singing just about sex, sex and more sex!! Thank you John Legend for giving me a CD I can be proud that I bought!
B00004TJKI|2.0|This movie had a theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1, while the DVD aspect ratio is 4:3.  This means that one of the following two things is likely to be fact about this DVD: (1) the movie is presented in an \\"Unmatted Full-Screen\\" format, or (2) the movie is presented in a \\"Pan&Scan\\" format.  If the movie is presented in an \\"Unmatted Full-Screen\\" format, then the film negative aspect ratio was probably 1.37:1 (almost 4:3), and almost none of the original theatrical image has been removed for exhibition on a 4:3 television screen.  For theatrical exhibition, the image would have been \\"matted\\" (partially covered from the top down and bottom up) to produce a 1.85:1 image.  For exhibition on a 4:3 television screen, the \\"mattes\\" would simply be removed.  So the DVD exhibition would actually show 25.9 percent more image than the theatrical exhibition.  The movie may have been filmed this way so that the theatrical image wouldn't be butchered on television by the \\"Pan&Scan\\" process, and because the filmmakers didn't foresee the current state of the home video market (which didn't really exist in 1959), where consumers prefer movies presented in their theatrical aspect ratio, rather than in a ratio in which the image will fill up their 4:3 television screen (if there is a difference).  Or, it may be that the filmmakers didn't want to work with anamorphic lenses.  As an \\"Unmatted Full-Screen\\" formatted DVD, this DVD would present the movie in the aspect ratio in which the filmmakers wanted people to see it on a 4:3 television, but it would not present the movie in the aspect ratio in which the filmmakers wanted people to see it in a movie theater (for that, the DVD would have to present the movie in a \\"matted widescreen\\" format).  On the other hand, if this movie was shot in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, then 27.9 percent of the original theatrical image has been removed for the DVD exhibition, so that the DVD image fills your entire 4:3 television screen (theatrical aspect ratio- 1.85:1; DVD aspect ratio - 4:3).  If you're okay with either scenario, enjoy!
1592400876|4.0|This book is such fun! You can actually hear the British sense of humor as you read. Major problem: to whom to lend it now that I'm finished. Most people don't read ANY books let alone non-fiction books like this. Perhaps the English teacher at school?
0792163710|3.0|Although the theatrical aspect ratio of this movie was 1.66:1, while the DVD aspect ratio is 4:3, this is not a \\"Pan&Scan\\" DVD.  In other words, almost none of the original theatrical image has been removed for exhibition on a 4:3 television screen.  The film negative aspect ratio was 1.37:1 (almost 4:3), and for theatrical exhibition, the image was \\"matted\\" (partially covered from the top down and bottom up) to produce a 1.66:1 image.  For exhibition on a 4:3 television screen, the \\"mattes\\" have simply been removed.  So the DVD exhibition actually shows 17.5 percent more image than the theatrical exhibition.  For a movie made in this fashion within the last 15 to 20 years, I would guess that the movie was likely filmed this way so that the theatrical image wouldn't be butchered on television by the \\"Pan&Scan\\" process, and because the filmmakers didn't foresee the current state of the home video market, where consumers prefer movies presented in their theatrical aspect ratio, rather than in a ratio in which the image will fill up their 4:3 television screen (if there is a difference).  However, with \\"Shane\\", I recall an article in a DVD magazine which stated that the film was originally intended to be shown in theaters in the 1.37:1 ratio, but the 1.66:1 ratio was substituted after the film was shot, so that the film could have the added draw of being a \\"widescreen\\" movie, which was a relatively new thing in 1953, but which was becoming a major audience drawing point.  This DVD presents the movie in the aspect ratio in which the filmmakers shot the movie and originally intended it to be shown in theaters, but it does not present the movie in the aspect ratio in which it was finally seen upon original release in a movie theater (for that, the DVD would have to present the movie in a \\"matted widescreen\\" format).  If you're okay with that, enjoy! <br />
0446677450|5.0|This is an excellent book for those who will remove their head from the sand long enough to read it. And it will make you think about HOW you were raised (in terms of financial thinking) and how you WANT to raise your kids. I think this book is so good that even if you don't buy it, you should borrow it from a friend or the library. *NOTE: If you do not like parables, then you will probably not like this book.

0440211727|4.0|John Grisham is at his best in this novel.  His works have defined the modern legal thriller.  In this novel, Carl Lee Hailey's ten-year-old daughter, Tonya, was brutally raped and beaten by two young, drunk red-necks by the names of Billy Ray Cobb and his slightly dim sidekick Pete Willard.  Things head south in a hurry when Carl Lee decides to procure an M16 from an old buddy of his from Vietnam.  All of a sudden the sleepy little town of Clanton, Mississippi, becomes the media hot-spot of the nation when, in a carefully planned out and calculated act of vengence, the girls incensed father takes justice into his own hands.  The entire country wacthes and waits to see what will happen next as defense attorney Jake Brigance attempts to pull off the mother of all acquitals.  For the next week-and-a-half, the young lawyer battles against the judges, the jury, and the Ku Klux Klan, to win his clients freedom, and keep him from the gas chamber. <br /> <br />          This novel ia a master piece, definitely one of his better works.  Recently I have also read The Client and The Chamber, but this book blows them away.  His mastery of dialogue certainly ranks up there with the all time greats.  His settings and use of vivid sensory details enable you to mentally transport yourself dead into the heart of Ford County.   I think what impressed me the most was that John Grisham got the idea for this book from actual events.  He is an excellant fiction writer, but some how stories that are based on true events have such a deeper and more personal feel to them.  I would highly recommend this book, but consider yourself warned when i tell you that it is not for everyone.  I believe that a limited understanding of the legal system is a necessity to fully comprehend these novels, other wise some parts, such as the appeals process or a writ of Habeus Corpus, will fall upon deaf ears. <br />
0316172324|3.0|Whereas 'The Tipping Point' seemed to lose me in how the total arguement was strung together, 'Blink' got a little tedious in that it spoon-feeds the storytelling yet never seemed to go anywhere.  I consider it a quick, easy read and therefor worth the time and money invested.  On the other hand, I want to say that it lacked depth even though I can't logically explain why that is.  Certainly there are enough examples presented throughout and each was thoroughly over-explained. (Ugh.)  Still, I finished the book wanting more...a stronger connection or something.  The entire book felt like the build-up to a grand denouement that never arrived.  It doesn't live up to the hype so just read it with realistic expectations.  It *is* entertaining, let's leave it at that.  ('The Tipping Point' was a much more satisfying read.)
B0001CNRS4|5.0|I dont know what all of you are talking about, it must have been guys reviewing it...i loved this movie. it had awsome music just like save the last dance and a cool story line but without having to watch julia stiles's crappy acting. i realy liked it, its a movie that you can watch repedtedly untill your boyfriend goes insane and throws it out the window. GREAT MOVIE!!!
B000002H70|5.0|The greatest rock album ever made. No exceptions. Each song is a masterwork in the deepest emotion from the opening until the end and once it ends it doesn't really end this album has a magic that stays with you for the rest of your life and never lets go.
0553381407|5.0|I have picked this book up time and again to read the same words and still depict new and insightful meaning from them. The reading is swift, easy, and a direct hit to the mind. Many of the concepts I read in this book have put my actual feelings into words and gave my agitation true focus, pinpointing it...finally! What relief!<br /><br />Though I have been out of therapy for many moons, I've been missing those single hours of air and breath and honesty. This book helps me find those moments again, within myself. A most cherished gift to mankind indeed. I do not think you will be disappointed.
B000002KP3|5.0|Let me start by saying this, if you do not own this album, purchase it right away. If you do, nice job, on owning a fantastic album. <br /> <br />Now, what stops us from classifying this album with the greatest of all time, like Dark Side, Blonde On Blonde, Sgt Peppers, and Pet Sounds. Was it because people don't think of Marc Bolan/T.Rex as a great musician/musicians. But, as clearly shown in this album, they could be. I think the only thing that lacks in this album, which ultimately makes it less of a great album than, say Beggars Banquet, is variety. It does not contain many styles and genres of music, unlike some of the greatest artists, greatest albums. But, look at the tracks: <br /> <br />1. Mambo Sun  <br />2. Cosmic Dancer  <br />3. Jeepster  <br />4. Monolith  <br />5. Lean Woman Blues  <br />6. Bang A Gong (Get It On)  <br />7. Planet Queen  <br />8. Girl  <br />9. The Motivator  <br />10. Life's A Gas  <br />11. Rip off  <br /> <br />Are these 11 songs not great enough to be classified with the best. I'm sorry, they are. And T.Rex's \\"reckless\\" style of RockNRoll, as they called it, sure managed to make a great great album, that should be in everyone's collection. <br />Starting you off with the nice, upbeat mambo sun. Then comes the dreamy and lovely Cosmic Dancer. <br /> <br />The fast paced Jeepster. My personal favorite, Lean Woman Blues is the 5th track. #6, has an amazing beat, which caused it to be their most famous song. The nice song, Girl, and the great Life's A Gas. Then, ending with another great song, Rip Off, a song just listing, crazy bad things happening. But, still with great guitar riffs in the backround.  <br /> <br />You can't tell me every song on here is not great, because I will disagree. This is one of those rare albums, like Rubebr Soul, in which every song is superb. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|What this little trio from Berkley have created is none other then the soundtrack for post-9/11, post-generation X, and post-suburban young adults who are pissed off but don't know why.  This is the album that defines a generation...a generation who was fed on Prozac, Ritilin, and Marijuana.  We listened to Nirvana; it changed our lives, and now here we are.  So where do we go from here?  Green Day doesn't provide the answers, only a prayer that gives comfort to some, and more than likely will outrage most.  American Idiot is, as the cover suggests, a pounding, pulsing hand-grenade of punk pastiche that doesn't for once disaknowledge its roots.  The Clash, 80's punk, the Beatles, Pink Floyd; all can be heard in some variety here.  But what really makes the album so powerful is the depth of its music that reaches beyond what this band has done prior to now.  The first half of the album, with such rollicking-rockers as \\"Holiday\\", \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", and \\"St. Jimmy\\" is a tour de force, and will engulf you in all of its sonic glory.  The second half is what many critics have complained about, but the beauty of American Idiot is that it really begins to reveal itself to you after repeated listening.  Once you embrace this album in its entire context you begin to enter rock opera heaven.  It may not seem so at first, but I promise you it's there.  And when the music stops, you'll say \\"hey, that was cool; I want to do it again.\\"  And you will.
B000002JS6|4.0|Releasing a gem of an album after the death of Ben Scott wasn't going to be easy. And AC/DC would not be able to release such a classic in the same year, right? Well, the first part is right, it must not have been easy. But after replacing him with Brian Johnson, the vocals seemed to not be a problem anymore, and many who hadn't listened to much AC/DC, could faintly tell the difference. The band hadn't changed much musically, and they stayed on course with amazing hits such as the title track.  <br /> <br />I have always thought of some of the guitar riffs on this album as some of the best in all of music. Just think of \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" or again the title track. You can't tell me, you don't want to play air guitar after hearing the beginning of \\"Back In Black.\\" Or at least get up and do something. <br /> <br />So, what made this album so great? The number of classic songs on it, sure helped. \\"RockNRoll Aint Noise Pollution\\" is a good battle cry type song.  <br /> <br />Rock anthems such as \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" and \\"Hells Bells\\" are clearly present. These would obviously become favorite. But this album also had a sense of immaturity that people liked a lot. \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\" grooves along nicely after two great ones, \\"Hells Bells\\" and \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" <br /> <br />The lesser known tracks, \\"Shake A Leg\\" and \\"Have A Drink On Me\\" do not cease to impress. I love this album, but never really got into \\"Given The Dog A Bone.\\" It is the only one I can say that about. These songs, put onto any other album, would make it 2 times greater. AC/DC certainly passed the test, with this album. <br /> <br />
0671027344|5.0|I strongly reccomend this book to any high school teenager out there.  This is without a doubt the best book i have ever read.  It is based on a teenager named Charlie, who is a very big outcast in High School, but during Freshman year he made friends, and he also made some bad choices.  Through the whole book you will laugh with Charlie, and you will also cry with him.  After you read this book, your views on how you treat people will be corrupted.  It lets you see High School life through an outcast's percpective.  I strongly recommend this book and think that every high school teenager should read it.
B000002KON|5.0|I discovered this album while systematically going through my dad's LP collection.  And it's just so perfect. <br /> <br />They don't make 'em like this anymore.  They hardly even made 'em like this back then.  I mean, I'm a diehard Beatles fan and I still find a song I don't care for on each and every album.  This one I play straight. <br /> <br />So, having just typed the most blasphemic statement of my life (better than the Beatles?  Christ!), I say to you: five stars!  Five of the biggest stars.
0385510454|1.0|Grisham phoned this one in and evidently was sleep walking when he did so.  Reverting to the style of one of his earliest novels, The Pelican Brief, the hyperbole negates any credibility in the story.  No president of the United States could be this inept and incompetent.  No chief of staff could be such a boob.  After this totally unbelievable set up, what follows is many (too many) pages of a repetitious lesson in Italian vocabulary.  Then there is the general sloppiness.  (Don't they have any editors at Doubleday?)  Delta does not fly from New York to Cairo and Lufthansa does not fly from Washington to Amsterdam.  Why would the two-term governor of Delaware, newly elected president of the U.S -- a job that includes government housing -- own a house in Georgetown?  Maybe his long-time chief of staff, also from Delaware, happens to be a life-long Washington Redskins fan, but not likely.  And, finally, when did Oklahoma move into the same time zone as Washington, D.C.?  Grisham has earned a comfortable living from his readers.  They deserve better than this.

I've always had an interest in money, but this book really got me thinking about how to go about my goal of becoming wealthy.  In a sense, it has opened up my eyes because now I know getting a safe job and working hard isn't enough.  The things I've learned most from this book are to continue learning and that there is a difference between your job and your business.  Although I was skeptical of Kiyosaki and his ideas the first 30 to 40 pages in, it ended up being very beneficial to me.  I am currently reading his book, Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens and plan to continue reading his books.  I strongly recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad for anyone interested in making money and that is willing to learn.
0887307280|4.0|Gerber's book E-Myth Revisited is an extremely valuable book that should be read by every small business owner. Here's why: In my work as a consultant and mentor for small business owners, I see first hand, every day, the cost of trying to run a business without understanding the fundamentals. I see one business owner after another who is stressed out, overwhelmed, and working for less than minimum wage.<br /><br />Gerber's whole point is that you have to look at each piece of your business to find ways to make it work, developing systems so you're not constantly putting out fires and reinventing the wheel. It's about recognizing that your business will grow and preparing for that ahead of time, anticipating the changes. That enables you to grow the business the way YOU want it to grow as opposed to having it spiral out of control.<br /><br />Gerber's premise is that by building value in your business, you create a saleable entity. In his opinion that is the reason to have a business--build it, then sell it. I think that's a matter of personal choice. However, it certainly makes more sense to build a healthy, flourishing business than to struggle along with a pale, sickly business, regardless of what you do with it in the future.<br /><br />E-myth changed the way I look at my own business and has definitely helped me when I'm stepping into a new client's business to quickly figure out where the problems are. The quicker I can find the problems, the quicker I can provide the solutions.<br /><br />Gerber's book oversimplifies. It has to. He has to break through all the swirling chaos of day to day small business ownership and get down to the underlying causes. Read the book, think about it, see how it applies to your own business, then apply it in the ways you think will be most helpful to you. This is not a quick fix, it's a \\"here are the problems, some solutions, now apply it to your own situation\\" fix. The most powerful part is that by making the more mundane things in your business simple, you have time for the really important functions like marketing, strategy, and business development.ndane things in your business simple, you have time for the really important functions like marketing, strategy, and business development.
0316172324|4.0|I wasn't sure exactly what I was in for with this book but because I enjoyed Gladwell's the Tipping Point so much I thought I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did.  Here is a book which focuses on thinking without thinking...in other words the point being that using intuition, hunches, or just plain old gut feelings is often better than using logical, deliberate thinking.  Interesting concept...going with your gut feeling, right?<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell shares the results of recent research in psychology and related disciplines, such as neuroscience, which not only confirm the importance of intuitive cognition in human beings but also offer a qualified vindication of it. He argues that intuition is often superior to articulate thinking.<br /><br />Gladwell shares a number of anecdotal examples of where intuition both triumphed and failed, leading him to the conclusion that while both intuitive thinking and cognitive thinking both have their benefits and pratfalls, going with one's gut feeling is often going to be the better choice of the two as long as one is aware of any lurking bear traps, so to speak.<br /><br />The problem with the book is that for all its pseudo-technical terminology of using phrases like \\"mind-blindness\\" and \\"thin-slicing\\", the bottom line is that there really is no concrete scientific evidence to support his beliefs.  In essence, he is using his own gut feelings and beliefs to support his theories.  And how's that for logic!  Still, whether you believe Gladwell or not, the fact remains that the book is a very entertaining read.  The many examples Gladwell submits will put a smile on your face at least until you start shooting holes in them.
B00008A7QK|5.0|I bought this album because I heard one song on the radio a few times and really liked it :) I think it was the \\"hot love\\" song... and now im finding out that this is a rock \\"classic\\" with lots of pretentious ponderings surrounding it... well I like the rest of the album and want to get another one too... What someone said earlier that its just really fun music is true, I like the beat and the guitars and even the lyrics are cool, it makes me want to dance! if this is what the 70s were like then I guess I missed out :) sounds like a great time for music.... I guess this means I like glam-rock music :) anyways Im happy I bought this and I listen to it alot, even if I am \\"new\\" to T-Rex :)
B0006399FS|4.0|I think we all have to face that U2 is growing and maturing, and have being going through a Pet Sounds phase with the past few albums.  After the Josh Tree, and being on the cover of Time, you become an icon and are no longer human.<br /><br />There is no way that U2 could meet peoples expectations, since people and there expectations re so contradictory.  So they just make their albums, come what may.<br /><br />You can play the album yourself, so let suggest my favorite songs:<br /><br />Vertigo.  This is the hard-riff songs like \\"Bullet The Blue Sky,\\" or \\"Elevation,\\" to remind us that long ago U2 was a Christian Punk band.  It is a song, unlike U2's sound, almost as if they are parodying rock music.<br /><br />Miracle Drug. Essentially a crescendo, but it does have a catchy tune.  I wonder how the \\"baby's head\\" lyrics went through the censors.<br /><br />Love And Peace Or Else.  Back to politics.  How do you reason with someone who believes that God reward suicide bombers?  The lyric about \\"Zion's Daughters and Abraham's sons\\" does underscore the idiocy of the Mid East conflicts, though.<br /><br />City Of Blinding Lights.  This is the best commercial track on the CD, purple eyes and all  Great intro and outro, and catchy lyric.  But it's the words that get you.<br /><br />All Because Of You. This track has to be a hold-over from the pre-Boy days of U2.  Bono sounds amateurish, but sings with passion.<br /><br />Man And A Woman.  This is their nightclub track that is almost a samba.  Bono does speak to us with his lyrics, that there is this gender gap, that on a certain level we do not understand each other.  If we recognize the problem, maybe we can advance to a solution.<br /><br />Crumbs From Your Table:  Clearly a reference to the Canaanite (Syrophencian) woman mentioned in Matthew 15.  She mentioned that even the lap-dogs get to eat the crumbs under Christ's table.  A message of inclusion. Please, people, read your Bible if you want to understand U2!<br /><br />One Step Closer.  Bono said that U2 is about the impossible, and is essential an optimistic bad, even with ragged doubts (\\"When I Look At The Word,\\" \\"Wake Up, Dead Man\\").  Key lyrics<br />are:<br /><br />I'm hanging out to dry<br />With my old clothes<br />Finger still red with the prick of an old rose<br />Well the heart that hurts<br />Is a heart that beats<br />Can you hear the drummer slowing<br /><br />Introspective, and passionate.  You get the image that Bono is peaking to you over a cigarette and a pint.<br /><br />This album is unusual, since it had two songs about Jesus, both back to back, and both at the end of the song.<br /><br />\\"Original Of The Species\\" encapsulates the idea expressed by C.S. Lewis, that Christ was a new type of human being-the first of His species, if you will-to give men a \\"good infection.  In other words, \\"The Son of God became a man to enable men to become sons of God.\\" (Mere Christianity), The connection to C. S. Lewis is obvious, if you look closely near the end of the \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\\" video, Bono is shown reading a copy of \\"The Screwtape Letters.\\"<br /><br />Yahweh rounds out the Old Testament imagery in the album-Daughters of Zion/Abraham's Sons.  The lyrics reminded me of \\"Do You Feel Loved,\\" but in this song, Bono takes the idea to the next step-total transformation by focusing on the individual parts of a person.  We change the specifics to change the whole.<br /><br />This is a fun album-but you cannot jump into U2 mid-stream.  There is an evolution, much like the Beatles.  I suggest starting with the Best Of albums to get a feel of how they have evolved, their favorite themes and their soul.

B0000CFW87|5.0|I love all of his cds and finally got a chance to see him in concert.  He sounds just like he does on the cd as he does live.  He also adds a sinse of humor and realism to his preformance.  His preformance was so moving and really got emotions going.  I think that there were only a few dry eyes in the stadium. Josh is awsome.
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|<br />Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez <br /> <br />Ok that's most of it. <br /> <br />But this film does have the best feel of a movie adapted from a video game. The framing of the story as it progresses using 3D computer animations to show where the various characters are in \\"The Hive\\", plus the point-of-view (a la \\"Preditor\\") shots that the central computer \\"Red Queen\\" sees, give a real gaming \\"techno\\" gloss to the proceedings. <br /> <br />The music score by Marylin Manson works great. I detest that guy's personna, but I am forced to give him credit here. He did make me laugh once when he said in an interview that at a multi-artist gig he felt he had succeeded if at least he made a few Alannis Morriset fans throw up. <br /> <br />Anyway, Resident Evil is a great techno-thriller-zombie combo. <br /> <br />Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez <br /> <br />Oh, I said that already. Ok, you get it. <br />
B000002AE3|5.0|Wow, I initially didn't expect a whole lot from this album but, boy, was I wrong. <br /> <br />I've had this CD for about a year, but have only recently begun listening to it on a regular basis. The band is as talented and as tight as ever and Steve Lukather does a fantastic job at the helm on this release. I'm not going to belabor this review with a lot of text/hype. Not wanting to be redundant, but if you want blow-by-blow song info, then please feel free to read some of the other well-detailed reviews. <br /> <br />This is a fantastic Toto album. It is musically diverse, but totally Toto. It's probably one of their best! If you are a fan of Toto (or have ever been one), and if you can find a copy of this CD, get it!!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Like many others, Dawn of the Dead was the film that really got me into zombie flicks. I fell in love with this movie so hard that once I had seen it, I immediately sought for a copy of the movie. I went through harsh extremes to get a sweedish dvd of it that had the Argento cut. I watched it all the time, but the quality of the dvd was wretched. Anchor Bay had 2 dvds of it, but I decided to wait it out for a better version. Out of the blue, this definitive package came out, and I grabbed it in a heartbeat. The package contains 3 versions of the movie (u.s. theatrical, extended, and european) plus a dvd of documentaries, a booklet, and a comic book. For anyone who is a die-hard fan and wants to get the full package, I highly reccomend getting this.

B000268QB2|5.0|I fell in love with this album last spring. I figure it would wear out and all the songs would sound bubble gummy and I would be wondering how I ever liked this stuff. This album has stood the test of time for me which places it in my all time top 20 (what would I bring if I were stranded on an island). I have probably listened to it 200 times. <br /> <br />One song has worn on me, \\"somewhere only we know\\" but the rest have not. Sometimes I have to put it away for a month but it's always has sounded great when I bring it back out. This is such a great album to listen to from start to finish. Also for some reason I enjoy this music more while listening at night than in the day. Not sure why. <br /> <br />Any way I have read a bunch of reviews here and I agree with so many of the positive ones. Of course there will always be critics but even if your a skeptic it's worth a try. If it's not your thing, then it's not your thing. I wanted to share my long term experience with this album. Can't wait for the next one.
B00006JKOL|5.0|I will add to the list of Tull skulls who adore this album!  It is a bit quieter than some of my other favorites, but the intricacy and sublime contemplation on this one beguiles my brain.  One of the most psychedelic albums of the whole period in my opinion.  Maniacal, world weary, cynical, well yes...brilliant, musical, perceptive, well-crafted?  Most definitely!  Just don't expect radio hit central.  Title cut and Valhalla most well-known probably and up there with the great Tull songs (and pretty rockin'), but the rest of the album is stellar as well!  Black Satin Dancer, Requiem and One White Duck are very trippy, atmospheric songs and Baker St. Muse is on par with other Tull Rock \\"operas\\".  Is there a better ending to an album than the appreciative Grace?  The remastered version is excellent with some nice additions, especially Summerday Sands, March the Mad Scientist and Pan Dance.  No finer way to pass an hour!!
B000009EAD|4.0|I like the darkness of the album as a whole.  The ending trilogy is a great heavy listen.  The whole Anti-Christ thing is very creepy, excellent guitar riffs fill the track with haunting rhythms. <br />The second track \\"Holy Martyr\\" is actually a very sad song, filled with despair and hopelessness, but the music makes up for it.  <br />A great CD for headbanging.

Extremely helpful in accomplishing real work on real web sites, much more than Flanagan's Javascript reference guide, especially since Flanagans guide has very few examples.   <br /> <br />The second Goodman book is a condensed tutorial on DHTML concepts (Javascript, style sheets, the browser object model, and HTML) combined with reference sections on these subjects.  Javascript is just a piece of the web page puzzle.  The Goodman books put all the pieces together while Flanagan just covers Javascript.   <br /> <br />If all you need is Javascript get Flanagan.

B0006IIPIK|4.0|Computer generated special effects have been around for quite some time now, and often questionably so, but they come into their own with Kerry Conran's SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW--an innovative film that failed in theatrical release but which now makes a big splash in the home market.  And whether you love it or hate it, SKY CAPTAIN is likely to cast a very long shadow indeed.<br /><br />As a concept, the film seems to be based on the popular serials of the 1930s and 1940s.  This is not limited to the use of an improbable plot fueled by special effects and cliffhanger action sequences, but it extends to the dialogue and characters as well, all of which are typical of such celebrated serials as BUCK ROGERS, CAPTAIN MARVEL, SPY SMASHER, and THE CRIMSON GHOST. The film also draws specific plot elements from such diverse sources as KING KONG, LOST HORIZON, THE WIZARD OF OZ, and WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE, to name but a few.<br /><br />The story is typical of serials.  \\"Girl Reporter\\" Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) is doing a story on missing scientists--and when giant metal robots attack New York she unexpectedly holds a clue to their origin.  She and Sky Captain (Jude Law) form an uneasy alliance to get to the bottom of things. With an assist from Sky Captain's faithful sidekick Dex (Giovanni Ribisi) and the disconcertingly military Frankie (Angelina Jolie), the two search the world--and finally track the wicked Dr. Totenkopf (Laurence Olivier, resurrected via CGI) to his secret lair.<br /><br />The look of the film follows suit.  The live cast worked on a blue screen set, and with the exception of a single set, the costumes, and items the live actors had to handle, everything you see on the screen was created in the computer and added after the fact.  A great many people have described the look of the film as \\"deco,\\" an arts movement associated with the 1920s; this is misleading.  It would be more accurate to describe it as a mixture of pre-WWII arts movements filtered through a 1950s sensibility, and the result is like nothing so much as a pulp science fiction magazine cover unexpectedly come to life.<br /><br />Now, how much you like this will depend to a great extent on how clearly you recognize the film styles and specific films that have clearly influenced it.  If you know nothing about serials, for example, you are likely to be appalled by the flatness of the script and Paltrow's one-note performance; on the other hand, if you are a serial fan, you'll immediately recognize that the script is reflective of such serials as SPY SMASHER and that Paltrow echoes Linda Sterling, famous for such serials as THE CRIMSON GHOST.  It wouldn't be too much to say that in many respects SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW is akin to an inside joke.<br /><br />But most particularly, your liking for this film will depend on how you react to the visuals.  I am not a great fan of CGI when it is used to bolster live action films such as GLADIATOR or TITANIC; I can usually spot the CGI and I find it distracting.  But I have to come down in favor of SKY CAPTAIN: this isn't an effort to \\"make it look real;\\" this is an effort to make a totally artificial world, and whether it be giant robots, Shangri-La, or Radio City Music Hall the designs are stunning and remarkably well executed.  Whatever other shortcomings it may have, SKY CAPTAIN has incredible visual \\"WOW!\\"<br /><br />The DVD release is visually handsome with superior sound, and the package contains a fair number of bonuses.  Unfortunately, the two commentary tracks are less interesting than you might expect, but two short documentaries (\\"Brave New World\\" and \\"The Art of the World of Tomorrow\\") are quite good--and the original six minute short that inspired the film is fascinating.  Not every one will get it, so I recommend you rent before you buy, but on the whole this is a show truly worth the money.

B0002X314C|5.0|I've pretty much been a full time hip-hop listener now for a couple of years since R&B / Soul went under. The majority of Male R&B acts these days just look good & don't necessarily sound so good. You've also got the R&B singers who think they can rap (R.Kelly & Nelly). John Legend however, is the best thing to hit R&B since K-Ci & Jo Jo. (Sorry Anthony Hamilton fans, but I'm jumping on the 'Legend' band wagon) <br /> <br />He captivated me last year when I first heard 'Around My Way' off Talib Kweli's 'Beautiful Struggle' album (Really is an incredible song). In fact I got goose bumps the first time I heard John Legend sing that hook. He also sings a really good hook on 'And You Say' off Consequences mixtape 'Take Em to the Cleaners'.  <br /> <br />Anyway, the album is pretty much flawless. The first half seems to be pretty much produced by Kanye West. With his usual infectious beats on songs like Used to Love You & Number One. The second half however, has a bit more of John Legend on the Piano (Like the awesome Ordinary People). <br /> <br />My Fave songs were, <br /> <br />1. Ordinary People <br />2. Used to Love You  <br />3. I don't have to change <br />4. Number One <br />5. So High <br /> <br />Snoop Dogg & K.West's verses on their songs aren't that tight & Snoop carries on a bit too much for me on his song... Blah, blah, blah... Shut up Snoop, can't you see the Legend is putting it down! That was the only thing that disappointed me on the album! <br />

There is no poetic meaning. This is filth and proves complete trash can be marketed to mindless drones who love nothing better to accept utter garbage as an art form. Why don't I just record loud static and give it a new age poetic name such as When The Skies Begin To Bleed. You'd probably buy it wouldn't you. Pathetic imbeciles. I hope your little hardcore scene dies an early death. It is molesting music by encouraging noise as an art form when it is just as listed: noise.

1573226521|5.0|Life changing? Yeah, right.  I probably wouldn't read any further into a review that started like this.  Especially in regards to a Gen X novel.  I'm not saying that reading it is going to make you quit your day job and go find your own paradise (would that be so bad).  Read with an open mind and it could change the way you think.  The story is a little far-fetched, but close enough to reality to make it possible.  The plot is simple, the discovery of a paradise, physical and mental.  Garland's descriptions bring the island to life.  It feels almost as if it were worth the journey just to be sure it doesn't exist.  Garlands views on the Westernization of the world are not hidden in any metaphors.  It's evident where he stands on the matter, but the book does not get bogged down in a social commentary.  The message is clear, but if you disagree, you won't find yourself frustrated.  I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and 48 uninterrupted hours.  It might just change the way you look at the world.  It did for me.

0385510454|3.0|I just finished Grisham's latest.  He did surprise  me with his ending but overall the story was pretty far fetched.  Oh well, I did line his pockets a little because I purchased the book, but the story was not as outstanding as some of his others.  <br />I wonder, sometimes, if an author, after a spate of early success and record earnings, becomes an automaton turning out book after book because that is the way they are now programmed, regardless of the quality of the story.  Grisham definitely has a talent for storytelling.  He just needs to focus on it again.  I sometimes think that Tom Clancy suffers from the same malady.
B00068IOWM|1.0|<br />This is really nothing that will go down as even close to memorable but rather a forgettable record with flat songs, raspy vocals and (characteristically for Bono 2000) empty lyrics. The music in particular sounds maybe apt for car or silly MTV commercials but hardly anything more ambitional than that. Boring as hell, self-indulgent, self-important piece of irritating drivel that I have ever heard. Each song was more horrendous and shrill than the one that preceded it. These ones are repetitive, drawn out and lack any great melody.  <br /> <br />It might be (as can be the case with any artist) that the inspiration tank has run empty. It might also be (as is again often the case) that this is just a \\"professional fulfilment\\" (contracts etc) but, whichever the case, this is really a very mediocre album.  <br /> <br />U2 keep selling albums based on the momentum of former brilliance but they're also losing fans in hordes, especially the older ones who've heard them in way better times than his current ones. I'm starting to feel certain that those better times are not likely to return....  <br /> <br />Bono needs to focus on his music for albums instead of music for iPod commercials. U2 need to retire. They're just spoiling their former glory with such crappy albums as this one. Enough said.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000066NW0|2.0|The trouble with Avril Lavigne is she is'nt what she appears, meaning that this ain't punk whether or not she considers herself a skate punk or not is besides the point.  JFA were skate punks and they did'nt sound like this.  The image however sells.  The mainstream has it's own definition of what punk is and since to some degree punk has mutated at some levels into a highly marketable commodity (thanks to Nirvana)we are left with this.  It wasn't that long ago that punks were'nt excepted by anyone except other punks and certainly not by mainstream America, when's the last time your heard Jello Biafra on the radio?  The flipside to all of this is that it ain't bad pop music.  Whether or not she writes her own songs is really immaterial though I tend to believe based on some of the trite teenage angst that she probably at the very least contibuted the lyrics(Paid studio writers would have written better lyrics).  The bottom line is this, it's better than most of the corporate bubblegum that litters the airwaves and if pop music is your bag then give it go.  Me I'll take JFA and the Dead Kennedys.......
B000001EAQ|5.0|<br />This is a criminally under-rated album by mainstream media whom love crappy LP's as All That You Can't Leave Behind. Vastly underrated and underappreciated, this is their most consistent album they've ever made. Great textures, dark guitars and completely innovative sound. Easily the most original in U2's career, this is what I call MUSIC. When U2 were genius.
B00005JKGO|4.0|Yes, La Dolce Vita is Fellini's crown jewel, his overindulgent masterpiece. Yet it's definitely not his best work. I'm sure, viewed in the context of the time of its release, it was shocking with its unblinking eye towards high society or \\"the sweet life\\" debauchery. It definitely was THE film that really made Fellini's name known worldwide but viewed amongst his oeuvre, La Strada or Amarcord are better. Although it is touted as being his best, and rightfully so even if it is slightly misogynistic, it's not one of my favorites.  Running at three hours long it becomes a bit self indulgent and tedious at points.  Some segments are really entertaining while others could have been edited for length. There's definitely a lot to dissect here. It truly is a stunning film but I can only watch it in segments instead of straight through.    What makes La Dolce Vita, and 8 , so noteworthy is its combination of Fellini's neo-realist roots, which he would soon abandon, with his surrealist dreamscapes that he would eventually and wholeheartedly embrace. We have the surreal nightclub scene where Marcello meets Maddalena juxtaposed against Steiner's neo-realist double murder/suicide (if you haven't seen this by now then shame on you!). We have Sylvia's romp in Tivoli fountain paired against Marcello`s neurotic wife's suicide attempts.     The theme of paparazzi (that phrase as fans of Fellini know was coined from a character in the film) and the fascination with high society culture is even more relevant today than ever before.  However, if taken simply for its entertainment value, La Dolce Vita is as visually amazing as most of Fellini's films. Anouk Aimee, as bored aristocrat Maddalena, is breathtaking in a Jackie-O meets Sophia Loren kind of way and Anita Ekberg, as buxom blonde starlet Sylvia, is so very Anna Nicole down to her innocently aware child-like antics. Even 60s rock/Warhol icon Nico is in this too. It's a great starting point for those new to the visually poetic world of Fellini but I can't say it's his best. City of Women, And The Ship Sails On and Ginger & Fred are still my favorites with Juliet of the Spirits holding a close place in my heart, but to each his own I guess.
B00068IOWC|1.0|<br />This is really nothing that will go down as even close to memorable but rather a forgettable record with flat songs, raspy vocals and (characteristically for Bono 2000) empty lyrics. The music in particular sounds maybe apt for car or silly MTV commercials but hardly anything more ambitional than that. Boring as hell, self-indulgent, self-important piece of irritating drivel that I have ever heard. Each song was more horrendous and shrill than the one that preceded it. These ones are repetitive, drawn out and lack any great melody.  <br /> <br />It might be (as can be the case with any artist) that the inspiration tank has run empty. It might also be (as is again often the case) that this is just a \\"professional fulfilment\\" (contracts etc) but, whichever the case, this is really a very mediocre album.  <br /> <br />U2 keep selling albums based on the momentum of former brilliance but they're also losing fans in hordes, especially the older ones who've heard them in way better times than his current ones. I'm starting to feel certain that those better times are not likely to return....  <br /> <br />Bono needs to focus on his music for albums instead of music for iPod commercials. U2 need to retire. They're just spoiling their former glory with such crappy albums as this one. Enough said.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004BZ16|2.0|This is about as far off from punk rock as you can get.  Around this time, the Clash adopted the moniker: \\"The only band that matters.\\"  When they started out, they became wildly popular among disaffected young men and women for scabrous anthems like, \\"Garageland\\" and \\"White Riot.\\"  Their songs, in classic punk style, were short and to the point.  Sandinista, released three years after their debut, is a sprawling, grandiose statement to all music fans: \\"We are the only band that matters.\\" <br />There were already hints that the Clash's popularity was going to their heads.  Their initial title for London Calling was to be The New Testament.  Punk was about taking down the sell-out acts who packed the stadiums.  With London Calling's success, the Clash DID pack the stadiums.  They didn't remain humble.  It is near-second hand news that there is one great album buried in this mess.  I disagree.  The only fun you're going to have listening to Sandinista are the songs Washington Bullets and the Street Parade.  Other than that, you will have to wade through disco, mediocre dub attempts, \\"Revolution 9\\"-style pretentiousness (nearly unthinkable from this band a few years earlier), and all other manner of affectation. <br /> <br />They were just making an album.  The Clash must have thought they were introducing a bill into the American justice system or some endeavor of  comparable importance.  Did they really think a bunch of social activists would be squatting by their record players, trying to make out every word of the Magnficent Seven? I think the Clash forgot what their role was as a band.  Some of you may think that they, as a band, have only one allegiance: THEMSELVES.  Because they are the artists, they can do whatever they want and we're all supposed to think it's great if we liked their last album.  I disagree with those people.  I think a band, such as the Clash, has its greatest allegiance to its FANS, who made the band what it is.  To me, the inclusion of theseven or eight \\"experimental\\" songs at the end of this album is a big F*** YOU to anyone listening.  It was either filler to make it all a triple album or those sorry Brits actually believed they were making great art and we devoted fans deserved to hear whatever crappy ideas they had. Less is more, a wise man once said.  Thankfully the Clash recovered from this stumble with their next album (in my opinion) which is political, social and fun to listen to. <br /> <br />Sandinista, while powerful, is the sloppy, self-important equivalent of that \\"cool\\" lecturer from college, drunk off his ass, reading from his novel, which nonetheless contains some brilliant passages, but goes on and on, completely misguided, out of tune, out of step with anything the students want to hear, until he's spent, sober, and bloody well done.

B0002IVN9W|1.0|There are only two ways I could explain the poplularity of this album. <br /> <br />1.  People trust critics far too much.  For some reason every lame Indie critic masturbates to this album. <br /> <br />2.  People are actually so far gone from reality that they actually consider this album \\"quality.\\" <br /> <br />I picked this album up (luckily not buying it) after a friend told me \\"he couldn't stop listening to it.\\"  I never really thought my friend's taste in music was that valid, but now I think he may actually have a hearing problem. <br /> <br />This is more garbage, \\"retro\\", \\"post-rock,\\" \\"post-punk,\\" whatever you want to call it.  Fear any band that people call \\"post-anything.\\"  It probably means the band is a bunch of pretentious clowns who have lost all sense of reality.  This music has no innovation, no passion, nothing.  They sound like a really bad rehashing of something that wasn't that great to begin with.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|There's no accounting for taste.  I'm guessing that's why bitter naysayers love to put down this album.  Some of the people who gave this album poor reviews are the same kind of people who can hate pizza because everyone else likes pizza.  The rest are those weened on Top 40 or Alternative radio who feel they have a grasp of what is \\"hip\\" and are waiting for the 4/4, 3-chord pop chorus, complete with hook and completely literal lyrics that they feel good reviews entitle them too.  They need to be told what is good rather than figure it out for themselves and are completely suprised when this album doesn't sound like the 3 Doors Down.  No wonder they hate this.  'Cause instead you'll get three or so chords throughout a song with 7 or so people playing/ singing/ beating random objects to slight variations on a theme over that with honest to god emotions sans slick, rock posturing and cliched stage moves.  But in the end it comes across as a song with lyrics that are deceptively simple, yet, beautiful.  And rhythm is a big, big part of this album.  They have two great drummers, where as most states in our Union do not have one decent drummer.  (This is also the case in their EP as evidenced in \\"No Cars Go\\" and \\"Sleeping in a Submarine.\\")  Comparisons musically, as this point are moot.  But as far as how their music seems to be made based on simple ideas that are followed through masterfully and the way they engage their audience they remind me of the Talking Heads. <br />To me it just seems like they're playing music because it's fun, creative, and life affirming; and the reason they've been so successful is because that generally tends to to strike a chord with people.   <br />So for all you fomerly mentioned naysayers there will always be something like Velvet Revolver and your old STP albums.  And if you're in serious need of really, really literal lyrics Toby Keith has been making some fine albums you'd probably enjoy. <br />So popularity be damned, buy this album.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I'm not the type that you'd expect to listen to Avril Lavigne.. My favorite bands include names like the Offspring, AFI, Pennywise, Bad Religion, Fuel, Taking Back Sunday, and so on.. Although I got Avril's first album for a birthday gift a couple years ago and thought \\"Let Go\\" was decent.. She was extremely uneven on the down side, throwing out sugar pop like \\"Complicated\\" and then a strange attempt at punk with \\"Unwanted\\".. I was a little reluctant to pick up \\"Under My Skin\\", but don't regret it one bit now that I have it.. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Tell Me\\", \\"My Happy Ending\\", and \\"Nobody's Home\\" are the obvious singles.. You've probably heard them on MTV or the radio at some point.. They're above average songs with more of an edge than in the first album.. Avril's new album has much more of an alternative feel to it.. The first two songs, \\"Take Me Away\\" and \\"Together\\" really set the tone of the album.. The guitars are much harder and Avril's vocals are much stronger than I've heard her in the past..  <br />\\"He Wasn't\\" is probably going to be Avril's 4th single.. It's a pop punk type of song, but rather catchy and has an \\"MTV sound\\" to it.. That's the only song of its kind on the album.. \\"Forgotten\\" is my personal favorite.. It's strong, powerful, angry, and hardcore.. I never would expect something like that after hearing \\"Let Go\\".. But this is a much more mature and less \\"teen pop\\" of an album..  <br />\\"Who Knows\\", \\"Fall To Pieces\\", and \\"Freak Out\\" are also catchy songs in my opinion.. There isn't one track that I'd skip, as a matter of fact.. This isn't a matter of \\"is Avril punk?\\" or \\"is she a poser?\\" Punk has nothing to do with this album.. She's an alternative rock artist.. Yeah.. I don't like some of the things she says to magazines or on live television either.. But what if she was shy and quiet? \\"Under My Skin\\" definitely would not be as strong, catchy, or edgy as it is.. So instead of judging her by what she says or does, listen a little closer.. Give it a chance.. She's an excellent artist.. <br />And as far as \\"lack of talent\\" goes.. At least Avril doesn't lip-synch (Ashlee Simpson).. At least she can play an instrument (Britney Spears).. At least she doesn't try to be someone she's not (Christina Aguilera).. Avril Lavigne is talented.. And anyone who thinks she isn't might as well consider all these other \\"pop\\" or \\"poser\\" artists garbage as well.. I give her 5 stars for pure heart and effort.. Pick up the album.. <br /> <br /> <br />

B00003CXXJ|5.0|The cheaper version of this film doesn't include the widescreen version of the film, but the 2-disc special edition does. If you want to watch this beautifully-animated movie in all its glory, a cropped version just won't do. <br /> <br />And this is a beautifully-animated movie. I watched it again after enjoying it in the theatre twice when it came out and was pleased to discover that it not only looks remarkably clear but remains as funny today as the first time. Amid the layered humor and references to various fairy tales, \\"Shrek\\" has a message about judging people based on their hearts rather than their appearances that works for kids and adults alike. If you've been living in a cave and somehow missed this movie, see it now. If you haven't seen it in a while, see it again. You'll laugh just as hard the second (or third) time around.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|Miracle is certainly an outstanding musical experience for people of all ages.  As a single father of two chldren the lyrics of many of the songs help me express my emotions and feelings that are sometimes so very difficult to put into words.  My daughter will soon be graduating high school and leaving home for college.  The song \\"Come to Me\\" helps me tell her that I will always be here for her and she is always in my heart.  Sometimes these are tough things for a father to express to his children.  As always, Celine Dion has a voice superior to all other vocalists. <br /> <br />Finally, I certainly hope that the reviewers on this site have actually purchased the CD.  It is my belief that Amazon should require a \\"proof of purchase\\" before someone is allowed to submit a review.  Some of the reviews are rude and offensive. I hope those individuals at least made the purchase prior to posting a review. Not everyone has to like the music of Celine Dion but all individuals should be respectful and comment with intelligence. Amazon, please check on the validity of your reviewers. <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Don't expect much on your first viewing. But as the week goes by, you'll find yourself thinking about the lines and cracking up. By your 2nd or 3rd time, you should fairly be hysterical at some of the scenes. I recommend watching it with close friends. I'm amazed at how much this movie resonates in the funny bone.
0385510438|3.0|Starting out, the book was pretty good. It caught you right away with the murder scene. I was hooked for a while... The book lost me, though, somewhere in the endless pages describing every different church imaginable. I felt like I knew all the characters pretty well, but I think a lot of it was unneccesary and just made the book kind of dry and boring in spots. Overall I think the book was pretty good. It could have been better though. Throughout the entire book it seems like you're getting set up for some huge dramatic ending. That dramatic ending never comes.
B00005Q66T|5.0|There, of course, isn't the infectious bubblegum fluff that filled `The Immaculate Collection,' but `GHV2' is a sturdy contender of the former. It well-displays Madonna's reinventions, moods, behaviors and of course music over the past 10 years or so-the fact that it lacks \\"American Pie\\" and \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" doesn't bother me at all, because I'm not a big fan of either one of those songs.  <br /> <br />DEEPER AND DEEPER- This is an excellent club song, and, yes, it is about a man coming to terms with his homosexuality. The lyrics shouldn't bother anyone, however, because the beat is so darn hooky. (5/5)  <br /> <br />EROTICA- I love this song, I have no clue why it is so shunned. I guess like Britney Spears, excellent music is discarded because of the image or lyrics, but when you compare \\"Erotica\\" to today's filth, it's downright tame. This song is a great tune to dance to, and it just makes you feel sexy. Though it's more speaking than singing, the chorus is quite catchy. And for those of you who can't handle the dirtiness, listen to Janet Jackson's \\"Would You Mind\\" or \\"Warmth\\" or Lil' Kim's \\"How Many Licks?\\" and watch your jaw drop through the floor. (5/5)  <br /> <br />HUMAN NATURE- This is one of my favorite Madonna songs-it was the reason why I bought `Bedtime Stories'-its saucy sassiness and funky backing track are addictive. Unfortunately, this edited version strips the song of one of my favorite lines, so I basically never listen to this version. It's still a good song, but I recommend the album version. (3/5)  <br /> <br />SECRET- Very hooky, but it feels dull at times. It's still an excellent song; one of the biggest triumphs off `Bedtime Stories.' (5/5)  <br /> <br />DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA- Absolutely atrocious, the worst song here. (0/5)  <br /> <br />BEDTIME STORY- A lot of people hate this song, but I find it.....interesting. It was co-written by superfreak Bjork, so if you've heard her music, you might know what to expect. I can'teven describe this song, it's such a trip. You have to listen to it to understand its appeal. Its dreamy qualities are alright when you're in the right mood, but it isn't fantastic. (3/5)  <br /> <br />THE POWER OF GOOD-BYE- This might be Madonna's best ballad ever, it's truly beautiful. I love it. (5/5)  <br /> <br />BEAUTIFUL STRANGER- I absolutely adored this song when it first came out. I don't find it quite as impressive now, but I still like it a lot. A very infectious `60s-influenced dance track, it's a must-listen. (5/5)  <br /> <br />FROZEN- This is up there with \\"The Power Of Goodbye,\\" competing for Madonna's best ballad. It's very haunting, and I just love the ending. It remains quite hooky, though it is a ballad. (5/5)  <br /> <br />TAKE A BOW- So many people were awestruck by this dreary ballad, but I just can't get into it. It's okay, but kind of boring and it lacks the hook her ballads usually have. I just don't like this that much. (3/5)  <br /> <br />RAY OF LIGHT- Possibly Madonna's most club-friendly song. Its feverish hook and undeniable fun should satisfy any dance-happy listener. The lyrics are cool. (5/5)  <br /> <br />DON'T TELL ME- It can get repetitive if listened to a lot, but it's still so much fun. Very catchy hook, and the synthesizer effects towards the end are beautiful. One of the best songs off her `Music' album. (5/5)  <br /> <br />WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL- This song is so beautiful-its lyrics and dreamy background effects. I don't know why they made so many remixes of it and basically drowned out the original, it's wonderful on its own. The lyrics are true but girls aren't the only ones who experience the angst she's describing. (5/5)  <br /> <br />DROWNED WORLD/SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE- A beautiful ballad, but not her best. It isn't very hooky and is kind of boring. (3/5)  <br /> <br />MUSIC- Ah, the undeniable dance anthem featured in the album of the same name. It's so much fun you just gotta dance to it. I have a remix of it that might actually be better than the original, but this is great on its own. (5/5)  <br /> <br />OVERALL SCORE: 57/75  <br /> <br />All in all, some non-album hits are missing, but all of her truly excellent hits are here, and there isn't a single truly bad song here (with the exception of the horrendous \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\"). A must-have for the casual Madge fan.    <br />
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|Based loosely on Homer's Iliad, this film recreates the Trojan war in telescoped form, compressing a decade and more of momentous events into a few weeks of political maneuvering and a few days of outright fighting. It succeeds in a variety of ways.<br /><br />It creates an authentic seeming eastern Mediterranean bronze age world, not infected by the latter day Greece of classical times (which is more familiar to us), and thereby establishes a convincing cultural backdrop for the decisions which may actually have driven the events recorded by Homer. The war, itself, is shown for what it most probably was, a power-driven effort by one group to dominate another, and not a massive effort to reclaim a wayward woman.<br /><br />The characters, though drastically shrunk in number from those who people the Iliad, come convincingly to life through the efforts of screenwriter and actors. Though Helen herself is rather stiffly portrayed, Brad Pitt, despite complaints by some, gives us a very convincing and human Achilles. He does seem a little wooden at times though, particularly when confronting Peter O'Toole's Priam. That scene was the powerful denouement of the Iliad and called for more vitality from Achilles, as the man is at last awakened from his self-absorbed bronze age heroic persona, than Pitt managed to provide. But Pitt is excellent as the warrior par excellence and makes real the myth of an invincible Achilles as he practices and teaches and kills those around him.<br /><br />License was taken with the story as characters are knocked off who supposedly lived through the Trojan war and much has necessarily been left out. Still, that is to be expected in a film treatment of such a huge tale and, all in all, most of it was well done. True, Orlando Bloom's Paris is a little hard to take but then so was the original character who is basically a sneak and a bit of a coward in the original. The priestess, Briseis, who is captured by Achilles and becomes the cause of his rift with his fellow Achaeans when Agamemnon claims her for his own, is nicely portrayed in this film. Her part has been enhanced here from the original in which she was little more than a prop whose possession triggers the anger of Achilles against his leader and thereby sets the entire Achaean enterprise at risk.<br /><br />Eric Bana's Hector seemed wooden and a bit too much of a goody-two-shoes to have been the great champion of Troy he is supposed to have been and it was a little hard to imagine him standing up for long against Achilles as, of course, he ultimately must do. Of course, even in the original Iliad he doesn't really stand his ground before that fierce warrior but, rather, breaks and flees before Achilles who chases him around the walls of Troy before finally killing him with a spear thrust. Still, that is not quite how the great duel between the champions is portrayed here though it is handled well enough.<br /><br />The actors, director and choreographers seem to have captured the manner in which the ancient Acheaeans might really have moved in battle, as seen in the pictures on pottery shards that have come down to us from that era. In a stylish blending of ancient acrobatics, modern martial arts and, perhaps, not a little dance, Pitt's Achilles demonstrates why he is the unchallenged master of war and individual combat for which the legends seem to remember him.<br /><br />Alas, the episode of the Trojan Horse is a bit of a letdown and seems almost an afterthought in the narrative. It's particularly disappointing when the Trojans foolishly disregard the obvious (to us) threat the wooden statue poses and heedlessly drag it into their city, giving the Greeks the opening they've long sought. But then I don't suppose there was any better way to present this. How do you create suspense when something like this is so much a part of our historical background?<br /><br />This tale is dramatically tighter than its literary antecedent but, in the end, it does not quite rise to the power of its predecessor. Still, it's finely done despite that and worth seeing.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]ll, it's finely done despite that and worth seeing.

B0001ZMWQO|1.0|This is some of the worst, most destructive garbage that I've ever had the displeasure to hear. Don't buy this cd. You would be further ahead if you would just flush your money in the toilet. The \\"music\\" is loud, the lyrics are stupid. If you have any peace of mind, this crap will destroy it. Franz Ferdinand may have some appeal to angry young boys with an IQ below 80, but if you don't fit that description, buy something else.
B000002KIK|5.0|I don't know why so many people put this record down.  I think this is a great sabbath record.  Ozzys last record with Sabbath but I like it better than ecstasy.  No it's not as heavy as their earlier works and it is more experimental.  Other than the 2 songs that the drummer sings the rest of the record is awesome.  I love all of the Ozzy era Sabbath and this is up there with sabotage and master of reality. Fav tracks: Never say die, Juniors eyes, Hard road, Over to you.
0783226063|5.0|I grew up in a little town in Indiana.  If you wanted to see a movie you had to drive 20 miles to Muncie which had a classic theater downtown with a balcony and a huge red curtain in front of a movie screen that was set over what looked like a narrow but long stage.  They haven't shown movies there for years, but this is one of two movies that I can still remember seeing there (the other was Terry Gilliam's _Time Bandits_).  The reason I can remember this one?  Even though I was eight and my brother was four, we must have seen it at least three times. <br /> <br />I remember at the second or third viewing they were handing out a glossary of terms and definitions to explain things.  I've never seen such a thing for any movie before or since.  I remember later getting the movie on betamax and late nights watching it with my dad. <br /> <br />Anyway, my whole family loved this movie and we still do.  It's weird, it's complex (yet simple once you unravel everyone's motives), it's stunning and thouroughly entertaining.  One of my all time favorites.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Wow.  Way too many bad reviews that do not explain why they did not like this movie.  Like or dis-like, if you are to review a film you need to explain why.  Most of the poor reviews simply say boring or something along that sweet line of reasoning.   <br /> <br />This is a good (borderline great) movie about a fantastic comic book character.  Ang Lee does his best to go into the main character Dr. Banner's psyche and give us some excitement as well.  Just because stuff isn't blowing up every two minutes does not make this movie a failure.  The split screens...genius, a tribute to the comic books that made The Hulk what he is.  This film is complex, fun, and in the end a well done adaptation of a comic book character.  If your looking for dumbed down action, with 2 dimensional characters, this is not the movie for you.  A truly entertaining and fun movie to watch. <br /> <br />Bring on the sequel!!
B00005JLF5|3.0|DS9's writing in this first season was a little poor--it lacked development and explanation.  It is always disappointing when something interesting develops, then is entirely ignored and unexplained.  Characters also often acted, well, out of character.  They would do things entirely unlike themselves and completely below their capabilities because the writers found it more convenient to write it that way. <br /> <br />However, it is entertaining.  Some of the characters are very interesting.  Although this season is often far too topical and offers far less for discovery than it should, it is still fun to watch. <br /> <br />The DVD setup was remarkably poorly designed.  The format for the episode selections is terrible.  We had to look at the box to figure out what sequence they aired in.  The extras on the last disk  are even worse.  They are randomly scattered around the screen, usually without even a description of what they are.  And they're FULL of spoilers about the rest of the entire series!!  Instead of just a perspective about the particular season, they talked about the entire series and gave away a lot of info as to what happens in later seasons.  It's like they gave no thought at all to the format and setup of the DVD's. <br /> <br />I gave it three stars, because there's a balance between enjoying the episodes and having to deal with the poorly-conceived presentation of them.
B000003489|5.0|Since its release in early 1960, much has been written on \\"Giant Steps\\", the first album from the legendary John Coltrane to be released on Atlantic Records. Although Coltrane had been honing his chops during the previous five years with Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk and on his own recordings as a leader for the Prestige and Blue Note labels, \\"Giant Steps\\" is where the pieces all fell together for Coltrane and marks the beginning of a classic phase which would continue until his death in 1967.<br /><br />This is Coltrane at his most lyrical and most upbeat. Classics such as the title track, \\"Cousin Mary\\", \\"Mr. P.C\\" and the sentimental ballad \\"Naima\\" are full of fresh musical ideas and still sound like new pieces today. In addition, the deluxe edition doubles the original album in length by including many alternate takes and early versions of several tracks. The disc is also packaged in a reproduction of its original album cover and features a separate booklet offering a historical insight to this timeless classic. Finally, it should be noted that the remastered sound quality of this edition is amazing displaying the original 1959 recordings in a manner that fits perfectly alongside anything current.<br /><br />Simply put, no music collection is complete without \\"Giant Steps\\" (and Coltrane's immortal 1964 classic \\"A Love Supreme\\"). This is simply some of the best Jazz music ever made by one its groundbreaking pioneers. A Giant Step Indeed.
B00005JNEW|5.0|I don't know any better than others that have written why this film does not hew closer to the facts.  The underlying story does not seem to me to need any embellishment or changes for change sake. <br /> <br />The acting is outstanding.  Billy Bob is highly nuanced and convincing without overplaying anything.  To me this is the way top coaches are, not the way they are usually portrayed.  These are people that know when to talk and when to hold their thoughts to themselves.  The coach's wife is convincing.  All of the players are excellent, although they seem a bit old.  Tim McGraw is great.  Perhaps in real life the father was never physical with the kid, but the relationship seems well-drawn to me.   <br /> <br />The action footage was great. <br /> <br />I liked \\"Remember the Titans,\\" too, but that movie was offensively inaccurate to someone, like me, that lived though that time in Northern Virginia.  I guess I cannot say whether \\"Friday Night\\" captured the way Odesssa, Texas really was in 1988, but I can vouch for the fact that Alexandria, VA, was nothing like what it was portrayed as in \\"Remember the Titans.\\"  If they wanted to set a movie in rural Mississippi in the mid '60s, don't call it non-fiction and pretend it is Alexandria, VA, years later.   <br /> <br />The cinematography, the soundtrack, the sound, the lighting, the camerawork (well-done documentary style) were all first rate in \\"Friday Night.\\"  Skilled storytelling.  Never a dull moment.  Heck of a movie in my book.  I think you will like it.
B000002JS6|4.0|I got this CD for Christmas and absolutely love it! This is their best CD without a doubt. Their most legendary hits came off of this album and this album definitley has it all. Great riffs provided by our crazy Angus Young, and great vocals by Brian Johnson. Their best hits that came out on this album are definitley \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"Back In Black\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long.\\" Buy this album and you will become an AC/DC fanatic. This CD is definitely a masterpiece!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|i haven't reviewed an album on amazon.com in years. every now and then you come across something special, something bursting with life, with spirit, with moments of genius. this is one of those albums. top 40 people will probably not like this, it's very different, challenging and non-formulaic. however, if you enjoy stuff like the pixies, neutral milk hotel, cat power, built to spill, you'll LOVE arcade fire.  <br /> <br />they employ walls of swirling sound, intelligent wordplay, and guttural emotion. wow, is all i can say after listening to it through 4 times over these first few days i've had it. its music like this that reminds you why you love music, feel music, so much deep inside you. bravo. encore.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Sorry, I just got the sudden urge to quote one of the show's best songs \\"Defying Gravity\\", which really says it all. This is a fantastic musical, with superb songs (mostly) and even better vocals. Joel Grey, Broadway vet and Tony winner (not for this role), has quite a fun solo (Wonderful) which reminds one of the old vaudeville days. Norbert Leo Butz is an excellent Fiyero, and you'll be dancing along with him in, of course, \\"Dancing Through Life\\". Now, on to the leading ladies! Kristin Chenowith as Galinda (not a typo, read the book to see) is excellent with her trademark song \\"Popular\\", and Idina Menzel as lead role of Elphaba, Oz's more notorious witch, BLOWS YOUR MIND!!! If you think she's good from what you've heard in the clips, you haven't heard anything yet. She won her Tony for this role. One minor reason to back away is the two poorly done songs, \\"Something Bad\\" and \\"Sentimental Man\\" but those can be skipped. A major reason to get this is that almost all of the Original Cast have left the show, so now you won't be able to hear them anywhere else. GET IT NOW WHILE IT'S STILL IN STOCK!!

630460288X|3.0|Hi... I don't know if you already fuund a solutions about this issue. I just found out why! <br /> <br />This DVD was probably made from the international edition which was digitally modified to remove Taco Bell and insert Pizza Hut. The reason is the following: to keep the effectiveness of the product placement operation.  <br />In simple words, Taco bell was not very famous abroad and was replaced in the international edition with Pizza Hut in video and audio presence too. <br />Of course they are brands of the same gruop (Pepsi): it was something coordinated with the producer and the corporate involved. <br />I hope this will help you... <br /> <br />Sorry about my english language...

6301966562|5.0|I live in Hong Kong where this movie is available on VCD, on two discs, where the quality is very good but not to DVD standards. I first saw the film on tape in the 90's when I lived in Greece and have been a big fan of it ever since. I watched it yet again the other afternoon. I keep on checking with IMDB to see if the studios have come to their senses and released it on DVD but no luck so far.
B000002KOO|3.0|I know the Mac blues purists, along with the megafans who think anything FM ever hacked into a microphone is golden, will target this review as \\"unhelpful\\". However, holding the party line would be the truly unhelpful act on my part toward my fellow consumers.<br /><br />I love pop...and I love blues...so I can appreciate both extremes of the Fleetwood Mac style. But this is not a 5 star blues album in the sense that it can proudly stand alongside classic blues from Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy and the like. Even taken as a blues-influenced rock album, it can't hold a candle to Clapton's best efforts. This however is probably the best effort turned out by the Peter Green era Mac, containing nearly all of their best early material.<br /><br />\\"Oh Well (Pt.1)\\" is a straight up classic, wisely included on \\"The Chain\\" boxset. Here you get the entire 8:56 version and you see why it wasn't a hit as is...it's simply too long. It flags after several minutes of tasteful acoustic guitar and what sounds like recorder. Masturbation ode \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" also is a great Peter Green rocker. Green adds one more highlight with moody blues number \\"Before the Beginning\\".<br /><br />Guitarist/lyricist Danny Kirwan manages to be responsible for several disc highlights (\\"Although the Sun is Shining\\" is gorgeous although lyrically slight and \\"Like Crying\\" is a nice blues) and pitfalls (the lyric for \\"When You Say\\" is abysmal,\\"My Dream\\" is a dull instrumental) at the same time.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Don't expect it to supplant a giant hole in your musical education, but if all you know of Mac is the Buckingham/Nicks era, you're missing out on some good early music. This is worth having for any Mac fan and most rock appreciators will find it a worthy addition to their collections.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars.
0385513755|5.0|Preview Your Review<br /><br />Your Title:<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code: Special Illustrated Edition<br /><br />Here is how your review will appear on the title page:<br /><br />Fred (darkjaidin187@cs.com), a student doing a book report, February 1, 2005,<br /><br />the da vinci code is masterful<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is an awesome, off your seat historical thriller that will keep you guessing until the end and when you think you know what is going on, it will flip upside down. The book is about a symbologist named Robert Langdon, who is strangely invited to have drinks with the famous curator, Jacques Sauniere, after Langdon's lecture. Saniere never showed up. When Langdon was back at his hotel in France, he is called by the judicial police and is taken to where Sauniere's body was found, murdered. The captain of the judicial police thinks he might have had something to do with it. After investigating for any clues at the crime scene, a woman named Sophie, who actually is the granddaughter of Sauniere. Secretly Sophie tells Langdon he is in danger and they escape from the police because of how suspicious they are. For most of the rest of the book, they follow the clues left by Sauniere, leading to what they think could be the Holy Grail or the location of the forbidden Lady Magdalene. Throughout the book they are helped and betrayed at the same time, and there are times where they are helpless or in complete control. The book has so many twist and turns, that you sometime have to read parts over again to understand it, but in the end, everything makes sense. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone looking for a good book involving history, art, corruption, secret symbols, secret organizations, murder, and one hell of a treasure hunt. This book is only one of the few books that is over 400 pages and at the same time a major page-turner. There was no part of this book that made me bored. It gave me a new respect for art and such people as Leonardo Da Vinci, who in many ways was a huge influence on the way we live now. Me being a picky reader can tell you this is a book worth buying and is so enlightening and crammed with information, that it truly is among the greats.nci, who in many ways was a huge influence on the way we live now.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Several years go, I saw the first few episodes of this when it first hit HBO.  Though I loved it, I took up a night job and couldn't see the last 7 episodes on TV when they first aired.  Fast forward to the spring of 2004.  I was in college then and my friends decided that instead of pissing our nights away playing videogames and watching anime (ugh, the horror!  What an utter fool I used to be!), we'd watch Band of Brothers, one episode a night for a week.  Having only seen a few episodes I was enthusiastic to finish the series.  The plan to watch one episode a night tanked right away, we ended up watching two a night.  We only refrained from watching three or four because honestly, what hardworking college student has four hours to put aside for watching TV on a Wednesday night?   <br /> <br />     There were differences right away between what I'd seen on TV a few years ago and what I was watching now.  At least, I thought it was different - I remembered seeing something \\"good\\", but what I watched that spring was simply incredible.  I had no concept of what I had been watching when I saw the first episodes during high school.  This series is moving, highly emotional, and quite honestly, the best thing I have ever seen on a screen.  I will say again for clarity - it is my humble opinion that this is the best thing ever put to film.  People write this off as \\"GI Joe\\" action and mindless Nazi-killing.  I really wonder if they saw the same series I did.  If reviewers say that this is only about the action, they've missed the point.  The heart of this series is really the men and how they react to combat.  I was deeply moved by the characters (especially Dick Winters and Lewis Nixon, played by Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston, respectively), got a sense of the horrors of war (particularly the Normandy jump and the hellish artillery barrage outside Foy), and was brought to the brink of tears multiple times - Bastogne and the aforementioned Foy among others.  I am not a man that cries easily, either.  My girlfriend (what a gal!) got me the boxed set for Christmas, and after watching the series a second and third time through I can honestly say that if anything, I was more profoundly affected on successive viewings.   <br /> <br />     As a side note, a friend and I saw Dick Winters speak a couple of weeks after I finished watching Band of Brothers in spring 2004 - anybody who says the characters are unbelievable or unrealistic is absolutely and irrevocably wrong.  Winters, the man, was EXACTLY the same as Winters, the character.  Standing outside that high school auditorium I'd driven out to (it was filled past capacity), I felt I'd already seen him before -  ten hours' worth!.  Damian Lewis did one hell of a job portraying his character.  Watch the special features (\\"We Stand Alone Together\\" particularly) and it's obvious that the rest of the characters are more or less dead-on as well.  It's easy to say guys like Bull Randleman and John Martin were cliche or stereotypical, but I suspect that what we see on-screen is closer to reality than we can know.  Watching Babe Heffron being interviewed on the special features disc is a good example - in the series, Heffron is a smart-alecky kid from Philadelphia.  In interviews, he comes across as an old, smart-alecky guy from Philadelphia.  Ditto on Bill Guarnere.  In \\"We Stand Lone Together\\", Martin comes across as being like his character, Popeye comes across as being like his character, Shifty Powers comes across as being like his character -  you get where I'm going with this?  I came away thinking that the characters were extraodinarily true to the real men.  That's quite a feat in Hollywood these days. <br /> <br />5/5 stars.  The series isn't just recommended - it's imperative you see this.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|This is really a five stars album, the last of the five albums Simon & Garfunkel recorded for Columbia. The album is a pleasure to listen from beginning to end. I don't care at all about Grammy, but at least, if this album received a lot of them, maybe at those times the Grammy gave their prizes to real artists like Simon & Garfunkel, instead of Beyonce, Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna and such... <br /> <br />
B00005IC2H|5.0|Sitting down and offering a review of this band seems almost futile, and nearly worthless. What they have produced here and on ( ) is art that is absolutely amazing, and is as different from popular music as chopin is from good charlotte. What they are doing feels almost as important, and as REAL, as those high, symphonic constructions. There is little I can say that hasn't already been said. The \\"lyrics\\" aren't really lyrics; they are sung in Hopelandic, a made up language, and really they feel more like spontaneous emissions of sound than anything else. but they are still able to, and perhaps are even more effective at triggering emotion in the listener because of this. we are not able to try and analyze the individual words, and to even look for the meaning of what is being conveyed is hard and perhaps even pointless. It's almost like looking at the myths of other cultures, where you haven't been conditioned to see them as fact instead of metaphor. they speak with new significance, they are electric. just let it enfold you. close your eyes and be swept away by the rolling waves of gorgeous sound. and smile, that we as humans can produce something this beautiful. To call this work and band pretentious, as many have, does not make sense. I can't even attack the position because i fail to comprehend it. It is terribly far from it. Many people will not enjoy this album, and that is a sad state of affairs that we find ourselves in...but for those intrepid few who are willing to actually get something out of their music, and are willing to perhaps challenge themselves somewhat, buy this album and support this amazing band!<br /><br />BK

I applaud Seabold for daring to write a book with a heaven that doesn't have angels with wings and clouds and god. It leaves you open to decide what kind of heaven you would go to if this is what happens when we die!

0671027387|4.0|From the start of \\"Deception Point\\", the suspense builds quickly as we meet our protagonist Rachel Sexton, a government intelligence analyst and a cohort of supporting characters including the President--an ardent supporter of NASA and the United States stature as leader in the exploration of space, members of the delta forces and a handful of other colorful persons who all play into this intricately weaved story.<br /><br />In short, \\"Deception Point\\" revolves around the discovery of a suspected meteor encased in ice, two-hundred feet below the Milne Ice Shelf. The stakes rise when NASA scientists find fossils in the meteor which do not resemble any known terrestrial life form. Quickly a team of independent researchers is rushed to the Arctic Circle to verify the findings and announce the astonishing discovery to the world, Rachel is hand picked by the Commander-In-Chief to be one of these experts based on her past work with reporting intelligence to the White House. Once the team of unbiased experts is amassed in the frigid north, the situation begins to deteriorate as additional prodding pokes holes in the validity of the \\"alien\\" finding, deception and trickery are amidst and whoever is behind the hoax has called in some favors to the military and Special Forces in order to silence any naysayers.<br /><br />Until the recent success of Dan Brown's other work, namely \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", \\"Deception Point\\" was overlooked by many readers including myself. However, it is clear after reading this story that Brown is no overnight success and that his writing prowess extends over many topics. As with all of Brown's books, \\"Deception Point\\" makes ardent strides to provide factual starting points for everything presented in the text, which enables the reader to learn while being entertained--an excellent accomplishment for any writer.

B00005JMAH|2.0|Ok, I am a very avid reader of the harry Potter books. i agree that anyone that has read the book was disappointed in the movie. The first two were great, however in this one, there was so much they left out. At the end, I was expecting there to be at least another half an hour of film because of how much they missed. I am looking forward to the fourth movie but I cant help but think that it is going to be the same outcome. Since they keep changing directors, the set of the school and everywhere else is going to continue to change. I hope not, but it is inevidible.

0465043550|5.0|Re the reviewer who wants to judge Mandelbroit by the number of yachts he has. To analyze the man's work by his overt material wealth is to completely ignore a) the intellectual desire to solve problems that drives a great mathematician b) the fact that Mandelbroit is an old man whose material needs are already well taken care of. More money buys him nothing. Solving significant problems buys him everything he needs. OTOH, we have no evidence that the detractor has either a) yachts or b) math skills.
B00004Y6OA|3.0|From the classic Van Halen albums, this is the least satisfying. Lots of blues based songs, some fans consider it their 'blues' album, I dont think the songwritting is very good overall. Apart from 'and the cradle will rock' not other song is really outstanding. Eddie is not famous either for being a strong blues player, I dont think there are as many good solos here as in other records. If you are a Van Halen fan, you need to have the full 'six  pack', just make this your last purchase after you have gotten the other five albums.
B0006399FS|1.0|3/4 of the album is filled with songs as bad as 'Grace'. 'Vertigo' for example, was a hit single, and a terrible one. Cheesy, terrible song with dumb as hell chorus and pseudo hard-rock guitar. What else need the band of the guys who have lost their talent years ago to get some attention these days?. <br /> <br />This soup is whole dull and has the most horrible lyrics in Bono's life. When the announcement of a new U2 album rang through media outlets, a question emerged as to whether this was going to be their best album. Unfortunately, it's sad to say that this very well may be their worst effort. <br /> <br />The only thing missing from this album, with the exception of some actual rocking from what used to be a pretty decent rock band, is a label on the cover saying 'Buy an iPod.' Give it another video before little iPods are dancing around as Bono cries for world peace. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002X314C|4.0|John Legend - Get Lifted (Columbia, 2004)    \\"I know you're gettin' tired of the same ol' thing/Well, I'ma break the rules/Gonna change the game/You'll be screaming my name,\\" says John Legend in the title track of this album, Get Lifted. That line is very accurate because he does bring it to us in ways we haven't heard before. Take \\"Number One\\" for example. A familiar story about cheating turns into one with clever wordplay (\\"You know that I love you/There's no one above you/I said it the last time/But this is the last time\\"). And Kanye West takes an otherwise played-out Staples Singers sample, \\"Let's Do It Again\\", and slices it up the only way he knows how to make it sound original. The song could have done without his rap though; he should have stayed behind the boards.    As for the rest of the album, Legend sings his heart out while playing his piano. Some people say he sounds like Carl Thomas; I can't see it. I think he sounds like Bilal, but less erratic.    I would give this album a five but I can't. That's because I bought his live album, Solo Sessions Vol. 1--Live at the Knitting Factory, early last year and have been listening to it nonstop. Some of the songs from that album are on here as studio versions, but they don't compare to the live versions. One example is his best song, \\"So High\\". On the live version, it's just Legend and his piano; that's all he needed to take that song to the next level (plus the spoken word by J. Ivy was the icing on the cake). The studio version, with the orchestra, percussion, and background singers, is good also but that stripped-down live version is better. That \\"less is more\\" approach also goes for \\"Stay With You\\" and \\"Refuge\\": their studio versions can't beat the live versions.    I would still pick up this album because it's been so long since I heard from him. I remember him back when he went by his real last name Stephens (he played the piano for Lauryn Hill's 1999 hit, \\"Everything is Everything\\"). It seems like there's at least one awesome soul album per year: 2003 had Anthony Hamilton's, 2004 had Van Hunt's, and this could be John Legend's year. -EJR

American Idiot is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time.   <br /> <br />In it's entirety from beginning to end, I've fallen in love with this album, and have not been able to stop listening to it.  Its definetly far more mature than Green Day's past work, and I now do not doubt their musical talent.   <br /> <br />Wether you are a Green Day fan or not, get this album as it will surely never leave your disc player.

0783226063|3.0|Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" is to Science Fiction, what Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is to Fantasy Fiction.  While I grew tired quickly of the \\"Dune\\" series, the first book (and to a lesser degree, the second, \\"Children of Dune,\\") is outstanding: an absolute heavyweight of the science fiction genre which serves as the benchmark against which other works are judged. <br /> <br />That being said, while we finally been treated to what most would agree is THE definitive interpretation of Tolkien's works in Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy, there is much disagreement and dissatisfaction over movie efforts to make Herbert's novel come to life.  Those being, David Lynch's much-maligned movie and the Sci-Fi Channel's Television production. <br /> <br />Having seen both versions as well as heaving read the \\"Dune\\" novel several times, I can say the Lynch version is superior, if for no other reason than Lynch's vision is truer to the spirit and character of the Dune novel.  It is in fact, so bizaare and otherworldly, David Lynch actually hits the amazing, surreal world Herbert creates in his stories dead on the mark.  <br /> <br />Its true the Sci-Fi version simply has more time to flesh out characters and develop the plot details and intricacies, but juxtaposed to Lynch's version, the costumes, characters, sets, and the like are quite stale and unimaginative.  The horrors of Dune - the cruelty of the Harkonnens - the fascinating wonders - like the Guild, the Navigators, and space travel - the mystery of the Bene Gesserit, etc., are all far more authentically portrayed in Lynch's movie. <br /> <br />Lynch's only limitation was the time frame (and editing that he was forced to do to meet that time frame), in order to tell the story.  Imagine Peter Jackson trying to do LOTR in one or two movies and you would come up with a similar result. <br /> <br />Ideally, we would have a movie that took the best elements of both productions - the vision, mood, and feel of the Lynch version that takes the time to further develop the plot and flesh out characters like the Sci-Fi version.  Its a shame that a four hour \\"Director's Cut\\" of the movie was never released by Lynch - however, the continuity or sense of the film isn't really an issue with those familiar with the book. <br /> <br />In any event, if you want something that truly has the flavor of the Herbert novel, Lynch gets it right - concessions for brevity of the theatrical release notwithstanding.

B0007CNXUK|4.0|Haven't there been enough movies on Peter Pan? Geeze! That's exactly what i thought when this first came out, and though i didn't want to admit it, it still looked good.What's so special about this is the beauty about this film. IT's simple and moving, yet still necessary to see. It's necessary because haven't you ever wondered the mind behind the classic book, and inspired movie. I can't even remember a book having so many movies made about it, with the exception of Frankenstein.<br /><br />  Anyways this movie is lovely. It is sad, and real, and a biography we should all see. The young actors, especially 'Peter' acts quite well, and as always Depp makes another amazing performance, this time in a quiet way. I love Depp, and the roles he picks. They are always creative, and original.
B000001EAQ|5.0|This is the last fascinating U2 album. Whereas both ATYCLB and HTDAAB sound older and colder with each listen, Pop remains as incredible gem. Unlike HTDAAB, with Pop we have a lot of different colors to choose from, giving Pop an almost documentary feel. <br /> <br />Pop is just something never been heared before. Nobody could say the same about HTDAAB. Truly recomended.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Well I've had this CD for AGES, but decided to write a review now! I've recently been listening and I'm a new member to Amazon, so here goes! <br />Well basically, it's one of the best CD's EVER!! I recommend everyone to get it, apart from the rap/r'n'b/heavy metal lovers. This song has got Pop, Dance, Rock in it, and elements of Ballads. <br />1) Affirmation - The first song in the CD about the meanings of life - \\"I believe that junk food tastes so good because it's bad for you\\" - basically about what Darren and Daniel think about life. A great upbeat song but gets slightly repetitive 9/10 <br />2) Hold me - A mid-tempo song, about holding someone tonight, a nice slow Pop-ish song, with lovely guitars 8/10 <br />3) I knew I loved you - A really sweet slow song, which can make you cry pretty easily. It's got a slow rhythm, and gentle guitars. However, it's pretty old now but still great 8/10 <br />4) The Best thing - Awww, this one's a really sweet upbeat lively song. It starts off quite pop-ish then goes into a heavy, almost seductive bass line. The verse is pretty different as well, in the same seductive tone, and the chorus goes into a great dance tune 9/10 <br />5) Crash and burn - Another pretty lively song. It starts off slowly then goes into a sweet/fast chorus. \\"Let me be the one you call, if you jump I'll break your fall, lift you up and fly away with you unto the night.\\" Such sweet lyrics!! 9/10 <br />6) Chained to you - OMG I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!! It's my favourite song on the ENTIRE CD and sorry about the exclamation marks and capital letters, but I am TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH THIS SONG!!!!  I can't stop playing it!! It's got the best heavy bass at the beginning and moves onto guitars and bass, into a rock tune. The reason I like this song? The power of: Seduction. Yeah, I know, pretty stupid, but I love the words, and music - \\"passion, desire intense, urgency\\" - *wink wink* The whole song (to put it bluntly) is about making love (or even more bluntly: sex) talking about magic, and um...getting carried away. The music is soo captivating and I'm totally in love with this song. As my best friend said: \\"This song leaves you with the feeling of satisfaction and feeling dirty.\\" (not that I disagree with her!! *winks some more*) 11/10! <br />7) The Animal Song - This song is about how animals are more human-like than humans. How animals are free etc. Quite an upbeat song, with bongo drums to create a \\"jungle\\" feel. 9/10 <br />8) The lover after me - I wouldn't quite call this pop, it's more Soft rock. A gentle beat and synthesisers heard softly in the background. It's pretty cute, like Hold Me. 8/10 <br />9) Two beds and a coffee machine - Ok, yeah weird title I know.  But it's about relationships and quite slow. It can easily make you cry, or completely cheer you up. This is more of a ballad song. 8/10 <br />10) You can still be free - Slow and sad, and another ballad, only it's more of a power ballad. I love the lyrics and drums, but Darren's falsetto is slightly irksome 8/10 <br />11) Gunning down romance - OoWhat more can I say but this? The most heaviest bass line in the CD, very slow and powerful, but very sad. It's got an extremely sad, moody feel to it, and it can easily make you cry. Very different, but long, which is good. Warning: Don't listen to it if you've broken up with someone, it is tres tres muy muy depressing!! 10/10 <br />12) I don't know you anymore - A pretty good song, but quite slow. Sad, and a piano take up most of the music, accompanied with strings in the background. Could do with more instruments, but the simplicity is what keeps it so mellow, I guess 7/10 <br />Basically a must buy, you have to get it, unless you're a Rap/R'n'b/Heavy Metal lover. But who knows? You people might like it! Expand your horizons!! A song to fit every mood, whether it's sad, happy/bouncy, seduced (cough), crazy or romantic. <br />
B000001FS6|4.0|<br />This is really good, but it lacks something. I've Rattle & Hum bootleg version, a double CD including the full soundtrack from the motion picture. So I've some highlights missed on this release, as Bad, Sunday Bloody Sunday, Running To Stand Still, With Or Without You, etc. All live tracks from the movie. A good adition anyway. Also Van Diemend's Land from the movie is better.
0451196716|4.0|I think that The long walk by Steven King is a great story, and anyone who reads this book will love it. It is suspenful, it keeps you on the edge of your seat never wanting to put it down so you can find out what happens next. It also has great imagery and structure. Another plus to this book is that it has a lesson. Never take life for granted, one day you can be having a good time and the next you could be dead. Like in this book.
B000001E18|5.0|Truly amazing and different. I just love it. <br />Standouts tracks: <br /> <br />Zooropa - Numb - Lemon - Stay - The First Time - Dirty Day - The Wanderer.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The best album i have heard in a long time. The Mars Volta is so innovative and amazing. There talent has no limits. Omar (the guitarist) is one of the greatest ever.  BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!
B00012FXB8|4.0|There are so many reviews for this movie that I almost didn't take the time to do one, but I felt I should throw in another positive review for balance.  As a huge fan of the films since I snuck a forbidden peek at \\"Alien\\" on HBO back in 1980 when I was 11, like other fans of the series I wasn't sure what to do with this one as I left the theater in 1992.  Like it's alien, the film moved differently and felt different.  But I enjoyed it and still do.  I agree with all the comments in other reviews about this being a film much more concerned with mood, lighting, style, and the ideas behind the story, than with the visual splendor of what's on screen.  It's thought provoking.  So, to me, it's an art film.  Perhaps a lot of \\"Alien\\" fans didn't think the subject matter should be subjected to an art-film approach, but I think in the end it's a movie worth four stars out of five.  Dialogue is a little lame (\\"They think we're...crud!\\"), but the melancholy, dark beauty of the film, the characters, it's ever-increasing pace, the religious ideas, and a unique alien physiology make it a great ride. <br /> <br />As noted elsewhere, the ideas behind this story have to do with sin, redemption, sacrifice, and right and wrong moral choices. Director Fincher has dealt with these ideas elsewhere (Seven, Panic Room), and here they inhabit a horror story.  Roger Ebert has said that the aliens in these films, though primordially savage, are really just neutral; a force of nature, which take on whatever purpose the director wants them to. This may have been alluded to in one of the other 280 reviews I missed, but I recall an interview in which Sigourney Weaver suggested that the creature in Alien 3 can be seen as a metaphor for AIDS.  For all those inclined to misinterpret people, I'm not saying the movie is meant to take any stance on the issue other than to evoke emotions and thoughtfulness about the disease, and more importantly, disease and death in general.   <br /> <br />Here we have a closed, paranoid, sexually repressed, rigidly dogmatic society into which a fatal \\"contagion\\" of inexplicable origin is introduced. They happen to be all male, but could have been all female, or whatever.  They are actually androgynous (as Ripley becomes) in the bald heads and baggy clothes.  The male gender just works because Ripley, as female, is a grave threat to the male \\"good thing going here\\" of which Dutton's character speaks.  All the nice explanations about the queen from \\"Aliens\\" laying another egg on the Sulaco, etc., kill the whole point:  the source of the \\"alien/contagion/disease\\" is a mystery.  Where did that alien/disease come from?  Bishop's enigmatic response:  \\"it was with us all the way.\\"  Ripley, Dr. Clemmons, and Mr. Andrews lie to and evade one another about the reality of it, as they do with their pasts.  Ripley suddenly after two films becomes sexual, and acts sexually in an almost uninhibited fashion.  The deceipt still continues.  And the price of their deceipt, well-intentioned as it may be, is the high cost of human lives.  The alien/disease has taken on a new form, mutated, to adapt to its environment, as all effective diseases do.  And it will take the whole community banding together to defeat the killer force; even then, it exacts a high toll.  So in the end we're meant to ponder, I think, how the taboos of disease, sexuality, and death, impact our society.  We can interpret for ourselves who \\"The Company,\\" caring only about using the disease for profit, is supposed to symbolize. <br /> <br />Other thoughts are that this film is stylistically gorgeous--an appropriately dark, earth-toned, and creepy horror film.  Not having seen the special edition, I was fascinated to learn that the host for the soldier alien in the original screenplay was an ox.  One wonders about the religious imagery of the ox as a sacrificial animal, and as a beast of burden.  Parting thought:  if this film had been released as the only Alien film without baggage from or references to the first two, we all would have thought it was an amazing horror film.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Picture this: I'm a teenager and I'm in to the electric guitar. I own a black copy Les Paul and a fairly nice amplifier. I am up in my bedroom and trying to learn all the cool guitar licks. I know of all the rock guitar Gods--Clapton, Beck, Page, Hendrix, Nugent,Derringer, the list goes on and on. I'm putting my guitar away for the night and switch on the radio on my stereo. The FM DJ announces that he's about to play a new band that just released a debut album.  Half-curious, I kind of listen to hear what this new band sounds like... <br /> <br />Then the song \\"Eruption\\" blasts through my stereo speakers. I stand, slack-jawed, in the middle of my bedroom. The hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I had never heard anything like it! Then the song goes right into the power chords of the Kinks clasic \\"You Really Got Me\\", only this version is louder and grittier. Then this kind of raspy, cocky, in-your-face voice starts belting out the lyrics. I AM SPELLBOUND!! <br /> <br />  For the next two weeks, kids in school are talking about this new band called \\"Van Halen.\\"  <br /> <br />I wish I could describe what a buzz and rush it was when this band came on the scene. IT WAS AWESOME!! <br /> <br />  Side-note: Yes, Eddie is a guitar God and I love Sammy Hagar, but I believe during the Van Halen years, David lee Roth was the greatest frontman in rock-n-roll. (notice I didn't say he was the greatest SINGER in rock-n-roll, I said he was the greatest FRONTMAN)  <br /> <br />   Now that it is remastered, it is great to hear these classics. I can almost see David Lee Roth high-jumping, doing in- the- air splits and kicks, I can see Eddie playing the guitar like it was in his hands the day he was born,Michael and Alex keeping the pulsing beat. <br /> <br />WOW! Sometimes I wish we were all back there!
B00005JNEW|3.0|I watched this movie after hearing a review saying it was one of the top five sports movies of all time.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, because it's hard to imagine how fresh a story a football movie could have, but this one poured on the cliches on top of each other.  <br />The ending with the abusive father was completely unbelievable (in the literal way, not the blown-away way) and the rest of the movie just fizzled out at the end.  There was very little character development, and I didn't get a sense that this was a real 'team'.  Billy Bob's performance was mediocre for most of the movie.  He turned this around completely for his &quot;perfect&quot; speech, which, in my opinion, is one of the most motivating speeches I've ever heard, and which I think might justfity watching this otherwise completely unremarkable movie.
B00005R1N3|5.0|I can only second many of the sentiments already expressed by others - this is one of the scariest movies ever made. I'm 29, I haven't been scared by a movie since I was a kid, but BC STILL freaks me the hell out. Maybe it's the thought of lying in bed in the dark and suddenly hearing a voice whispering \\"Hello Agnes, its me Billy\\". BRRRRRRRRRRRRR! <br />This is one scary movie, and ludicrously underrated and unfairly forgotten.
B000002H4Q|4.0|The Cure's \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\\" (originally a double LP), is their version of the \\"The White Album\\". A lengthy, adventurous album with no underlying theme.  <br /> <br />Thus, intense songs like \\"The Kiss\\" (a towering, nihlistic epic reminscent of  their \\"Pornography\\"-era) sit side by side with  dreamy songs like \\"Catch\\" (bittersweet pop fluff). Similarily, clamorous songs like \\"The Snakepit\\" (an acid sweep drenched in droning layers of guitar feedback) sit next to breezy songs like \\"Just Like Heaven\\" (blissful, lovestruck pop at its best).  <br /> <br />Like \\"The White Album\\", the 'random' dynamic works. You never know what's coming around the corner. There's tons of moods on here. <br /> <br />The atmospheric \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\" is a chilling, eastern-tinged soundscape with a sitar and everything. \\"One More Time\\" is delicate and heartbreaking.  \\"The Perfect Girl\\" is carefree and bouncy (and extremely catchy). \\"Like Cockatoos\\" is just bizarre. \\"Hot Hot Hot!!!\\" takes a stab at funk (think Blood Sugar-era Red Hot Chili Peppers). And \\"Fight\\" is a powerful, anthematic closer. <br /> <br />Other highlights include the dark, tense pop of \\"How Beautiful You Are\\" and \\"All I Want\\", the lush ballad \\"A Thousand Hours\\" (a gorgeous song with piano, strings, etc.), the horn-driven \\"Why Can't I Be You?\\" (a fun, albeit dated sounding pop song), and \\"Icing Sugar' (which sounds like a \\"Pornography\\" outtake with a saxophone played over top). <br /> <br />Although it's not perfect, \\"Kiss Me\\" is The Cure's most diverse, sprawling album. It takes many listens to uncover everything; songs that seem dull at first may slowly become your favorites. Enjoy the adventure. <br /> <br />Best Songs: The Kiss, If Only Tonight, Fight, The Snakepit, All I Want, A Thousand Hours, Just Like Heaven, Catch.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|I bought this DVD for my boyfriend and I to watch.  When I got it home, and saw that it was rated PG I figured it might be OK to let my two sons, ages 9 and 7, watch too.   <br /> <br />OK - I'll be honest - my seven-year-old was sound asleep within 15 minutes of the movie starting.  But, my older son stayed totally into it though the end.  The visual effects were terrific!  I won't get into the plot - you can read that above.  I thought it was a great movie with a satisfying ending.  VERY unique in the way it looked! <br /> <br />Two thumbs up!  It's rare to find movies that are actually OK to watch with your kids, and this one is a winner!
B0001HAHXW|2.0|I agree with many fellow reviewers that say that this is one of EC's better releases in a while, but let's not confuse this with real blues. This CD lacks soul and depth. It is worth casual listening, but after the fourth or fifth playing it feels stale and mediocre. After listening to John Lee Hooker, Son House & Elmore James continuously for the past month, you'll find this recording as bland as I did. I just didn't feel the music. If Buddy Guy is your flavor, this might work. Otherwise, stay away and spend your money on any John Lee Hooker. You'll be glad you did.
B00009V7T2|5.0|absolutely amazing talent accross the board that produces a sound unique, and something that was needed to save us from all the crap on the radio these days.  Phenomenal guitar playing from Omar Rodriguez, who will soon be spoken of as one of the best in a long time.  Cedric Bixler-Zevalva has amazing range and is really one of the few singers in bands today with real talent...definitly has a great voice...flea of the red hot chili peppers plays bass on most of the album, and john frusciante of rhcp plays a 100 in cicatriz esp.  There really is some excellent drumming as well...there really is no weakness in this band... <br /> <br />there is only 1 song that is really 100%  mellow or softer and that's televators which is another great song.  if your a fan of any kind of rock or alternative music...this is the band for you...let me tell you, when i first got this album i got it for roulette dares  because i loved the song...that was 3 months ago and i havnt been able to stop listenin to it ...these guys definitly have somethin amazing going on and this album is absolutely a  must have for any good cd collection. <br /> <br />to give u an idea of other bands im interested in if it helps ur decision in buying this album, i love the red hot chili peppers, and i like muse, led zeppelin, hendrix, audioslave/rage,  foo fighters, franz ferdinand, pink floyd, nirvana, the police, smashing pumpkins and zwan, stone temple pilots, wilco, and weezer to name a few...just to give u an idea of what kind of music i like, if u like a couple of the bands i just listed, there is no reason for you to even think about hesitating to buy this album
0790731479|4.0|How can you ignore a movie with Michael Keaton as a exorcist demon ghost and Winona Ryder as a gothgirl? Great music, great fun, great effects with one criticism.....the ending sucks with all it's joy and happiness? What's with that? <br />If you like scary, funny films with an all star cast that actually perform to their abilities, then Beetlejuice will deliver to the max!
B000001F3N|5.0|This is a mailbox album,if you know what I mean. I said the same thing for Julio Iglesias' 1100 BEL AIR PLACE. The only things missing are the geographical location and zip code. The cover photo looks like it could have been taken in Florida because of the palm trees. This is Eric Clapton's debut on the defunct RSO(Robert Stigwood Organization) label. Clapton got the contract with the label through the Bee Gees,whose manager was Stigwood and who would be Clapton's new labelmates. The album's biggest hit is I SHOT THE SHERIFF,a reggae piece by the late Bob Marley. LET IT GROW was also a hit. Both songs appeared on the compilation THE CREAM OF CLAPTON. All the other songs are good.
B0002234LS|3.0|Adapting Stephen King into movies has been a risky thing. It's a hit and miss affair, with plenty more misses than hits here lately with the last few film adaptions of his stories and novels. They are still never less than interesting. And so, we have another film adaption of a short story by King, this one from \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\". Writer David Koepp writes the story into a pretty good screenplay, emphasizing on subtle tricks and pacing. Johnny Depp stars in the film as Mort Rainey, A grungy, near divorced author with wild hair who keeps to himself in his rustic old cabin in the woods near a beautiful lake. The opening of the film immediatley fills you in on why Mort has gotten to this stage, and why he is living in this secluded cabin. Trying to knock out another story, Mort is quickly confronted by a Mississippi man named John Shooter(eerily played by John Turturro), who claims that Mort plaigarised his \\"Secret Window\\" story, and is now out to seek that wrongs be turned into rights. It is quickly obvious that Mr. Shooter is not a well man, and his demeanor quickly turns psychotic and dangerous. Mort swears he wrote his story first, and sets out to prove this fact to Shooter before this strange man causes him, or anyone else, more harm. All at the same time that Mort is going thru an unhappy divorce with his wife Amy(Maria Bello), and her current boyfriend Ted(Timothy Hutton)is sticking his nose in. Charles S. Dutton is along for the ride as a lawyer friend of Mort's who is out to help him with Shooter. Len Cairou also co-stars as the local town sheriff. Isn't there always a local town sheriff in stories like these?. The movie hangs on Depp's every move. Every word. Every action. It's a small cast and it is all basically up to him, because he is in every scene, and a lot of the time it's just him alone. But this is Johnny Depp. It can be garbage, and he will still own every scene. Fortunatley for us, Mort Rainey is an interesting character. Another eccentric in Johnny's long catalogue of eccentric characters that he is a master at. It may not be as big or splashy or memorable as most of his other roles, but Depp infuses enough distinct personality, presence, and tics into Mort, that he is a full fleshed character that carries the entire film from start to finish. Not sure if I liked the hair yet or not. Turturro has always been a great actor, and his portrayal of Shooter is one of immense unease. With this southern drawl, big hat, and laid back ease, his John Shooter is a strange and memorable man. He brings the right balance of meance and humor, without overdoing it. Any time I see Turturro now, I will be seeing and hearing John Shooter. The rest do with what they have. Hutton, who starred in the King film \\"The Dark Half\\", is pretty much stuck in the \\"new boyfriend is a jerk and how can I get rid of him?\\" role. He's just fine, but it's a role with little in the way of a rewarding outcome. Maria Bello pretty much has the same fate. She does well with the material, but her role pretty much becomes nothing more than the ex turned damsel in distress. Dutton, who is always a likeable and strong presence, doesn't fare much better, but his being there alone elevates the movie. The film moves along at a pretty slow pace. It's not a slam bang type of a rush thriller. It plays it slowly, and lets it all seep in and build. Some may see the ending coming. Some may not. Some may think it's a disappointing cop out, while others see it as a fitting and interesting end. Whichever way you see it, it pretty much works. I was not necessarily shocked with the outcome, but I definitley didn't expect some of the events that did happen in the finale. It's not a really great movie, just a pretty good one. Not the best Stephen King adaption either, but better than a lot of his movie adaptions of late. But this is Johnny's movie, and he does another fine job that makes the movie better than what it is.
B000002G8H|5.0|Here is the album that would earn Eric Clapton the nickname \\"Slowhand\\". The same thing would eventually happen to Madonna with her hit song MATERIAL GIRL. Hit songs from this album include LAY DOWN SALLY,COCAINE and WONDERFUL TONIGHT. Only the latter two would be recycled for the compilation THE CREAM OF CLAPTON. The other songs are good.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|I understand how people can be upset about the closed captions.  Yet I have found out that Dreamworks(Go fishing?) is doing something about it.  They have released a newer version of the DVD that has the proper subtitles on it(will apparently say V4 on the spine of the DVD case) Also for those who are unstaisfied with their copy please go to the official ghost in the shell 2 website.  select the DVD and click on \\"questions about my dvd?\\" this will give you all the information you need inorder to obtain a replacement DVD.  I hope this is something more people will be satisfied with
B000002G8N|5.0|This album would be Eric Clapton's last on the RSO(Robert Stigwood Organization) label,at least in the non-compilation category. This album only spawned one hit,I CAN'T STAND IT. It also appeared on the compilation THE CREAM OF CLAPTON. The other songs are good. In 1983,two years after the release of this album,Clapton signed with Warner Bros. and put out his WB debut,MONEY AND CIGARETTES. As for RSO,it wouldn't last much longer,and would be sold to its sister label,Polydor. Both labels are a division of PolyGram.
B0006M4SO6|3.0|Pat Metheny has enjoyed so much commercial success because he is one of the few jazz musicians who really forms a bond with his audience.  Sometimes he gives fans the kind of record they want with few surprises (The Road to You, Letter from Home, etc); other times he tries to bring his audience to a new place and say, \\"hey, this is different, but I think you'll like this.\\"  Though it treads over some familiar terrain, The Way Up falls into the latter category.  It is a bold move in the sense that the \\"smooth jazz\\" stations (and even the hardcore jazz stations) can't readily play a 68 minute song on the radio, so the only people who hear it are going to be the people who buy it. <br /> <br />I really like this lineup; the brass and harmonica bring a fresh face to the signature PMG ensemble sound.  I would have loved to hear this band tackle a portfolio of originals, standards and maybe a few Metheny \\"classics\\" (a reworking of Are You Going With Me or James or something.)  Instead, we get ... a single 68 minute song.  It's still a worthwhile listen, but I don't think the format plays to the strengths of this group.  If your favorite PMG album is Secret Story, you'll probably love this; otherwise it's just another good Pat Metheny album.
B00063EMJ6|4.0|More \\"greatest hits\\" by established artists are putting 2 CD sets out. Pearl Jam and John Mellencamp put out a nice sized collection of songs that needed the 2 discs. Same with the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac. <br /> <br />As Geffen is now under Interscope, maybe future releases can include some of the 80s era material as well.  <br /> <br />This is a good intro to Neil for the people who have no idea what he did before teaming up with Pearl Jam but by no means is it a retrospective covering all the bases. He's been working on THAT for ages.  <br /> <br />The good part are that all the songs on here are classics, although ending on a mellow \\"Harvest Moon\\". I would have loved to have seen \\"Hank To Hendrix\\", \\"Mansion On the Hill\\", and \\"Downtown\\" on the collection or \\"Change Your Mind\\".  <br /> <br />But overall the songs here are great:starting off with 2 dark classics into \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" all through to the end it's a joy to hear them. \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\" isn't on Decade but it's on here.  <br /> <br />It ends before you realize it, but is a great one to listen to on a road trip, but if you already have \\"Decade\\" and could care less about hearing \\"Rockin in the Free World\\" or \\"Hey Hey My My\\", it might be worth passing on this. If not, it's an essential until a decent retrospective comes out.
B00000IP3S|5.0|I find myself drawn to this album again and again, knowing full well that with each spin I will discover something new.  This album is loaded with Progressive Power Metal that is both impressive instrumentally and emotionally evocative with its bombastic all male choir vocalizations and mythically charged lyrical depth.  The opening title track is not only the longest song here (a gutsy move) but the most lyrically nostalgic.  But the second track, \\"I'm Alive,\\" is where this album reaches the stratosphere with an intense chorus that makes all within earshot want to join in the choir.  The rest of the album is a roller coaster ride filled with some of the finest Power Metal ever recorded.  The musical arrangements throughout suggest nothing less than thoughtfully crafted, intelligent songwriting.  The production is superb and grandiose, highlighting each musician's skill but never at the cost of the song itself.  Power Metal done right is a wholly remarkable experience, and Blind Guardian are masters of the genre.  Highly recommended.
B000050HTO|4.0|It's an all too brief journey through 4 decades worth of music, but everything on here has something to offer from all the different eras. The collection is balanced out, which also means sacrificing a lot of great songs. For most people, the goldmine is on the first disc, whether their preference was the folk or the electric guitar driven songs, although those who love \\"Time Out of Mind\\" and \\"Oh Mercy\\" (but the mid 70s era is adequate although there's a few songs here and there that would've been nice additions) are going to feel the later material was cut short, but ends in the Grammy winning song \\"Things Have Changed\\".  <br /> <br />Who this is ideal for: people who still have Dylan on vinyl that just want to hear \\"Rainy Day Women\\", \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", \\"Lay Lady Lay\\" and \\"Blowin in the Wind\\" or people who want to get an idea of what his music is about. Listening to it while reading \\"Chronicles\\". Road trips.  <br />  <br />Because he has hundreds of songs if not more, including outtakes, live cuts, covers, and collaborations, I think that it would be great if they had a series of CDs similar to \\"Zappa's Picks\\" and The Beach Boys \\"Classics: Selections by Brian Wilson\\" where Dylan and some artists willing to take part would choose their favorite cuts and describe what each song means to them. I guarantee that each compilation would be radically different from the other and by far more interesting to see what they'd pick. In my opinion, it's something better left in the hands of musicians who truly appreciate his music and songwriting from the heart than a record label that has a knee-jerk reaction to picking whatever is going to sell around the holidays.  <br /> <br />
B00074CBMY|4.0|If you have an ear for the world-weary, this one's for you. Joe has selected a variety of old standards which reflect the perspective of someone who has lived a life filled with love, loss and laughter. The spareness of the vocals, combined with the lushness of the musical arrangements, evoke memories for those of us who have some of life's experiences under our belts. <br />If you don't feel on the verge of tears when listening to his heart-wrenching version of U2's \\"One\\", you still have some living to do. Well worth the investment in both time and money.
1400032717|4.0|Curious Incident is a nice book, a quick and frothy read that I thoroughly enjoyed. My mind boggles a bit at the adulation heaped upon it, a sort of uncritical fervor last seen hyping the much less worthy Da Vinci Code. <br /> <br />Breezily written, this book borrows some writing tricks from more substantial work. Notably, of course, is the use of a first person narrator who is \\"impaired\\" (in this case by autism) in a manner similar to, say, Flowers for Algernon. The use of unusual chapter numbering (prime numbers in this case), statistics problems, diagrams, and so forth is amusing in a observational kind of way. These are all tricks, though, that make you sit back a bit from the book. Oooh! Isn't that clever? <br /> <br />In any case, the back half of the book seemed to telegraph much of the plot and I surely hope we don't get a sequel. But it is so amusing and a nice diversion from much of the drivel available today that I recommend this novel as a good, enjoyable read.
0553208845|5.0|This novel by Hermann Hesse is great.  I borrowed from a friend and was sucked in by its philosophical discussion.  The story follow Siddhartha, an Indian in search of enlightenment.  He tries a few routes, lives life as a wealthy merchant, loses hope, and... well, you can find out.  It is short, not many big events, but the dialogue more than makes up for it.  Anyone who enjoys novels carried by philosophical dialogue/monlogue will love this.
0385510454|4.0|Frankly, I don't understand the negative reviews--the author himself said it best, \\"It's Fiction\\".  I enjoyed this book and found it to be a welcome return to Mr. Grisham's tried and true portrayal of a lawyer in trouble who manages to frustrate the bad guys and save his own skin.  Some may quibble with the attempt to tread upon Tom Clancy's hallowed ground but in today's post-Clinton world you just can't blame Mr. Grisham for going after the Vernon Jordan set.<br /><br />Mr. Grisham writes escape stories and he writes them well.  His most successful stories place a flawed but sympathetic character who is at the mercy of the ethically challenged (i.e. bad guys) into a situation initially of their own making from which they safely extricate themselves by making decisions as smart as their previous decisions were stupid.  Therein lies the trick--Grisham balances the dilemmas perfectly.  The character bears a measured amount of blame for his circumstances; not so much that he is unsympathetic, but enough so that there is room for the character to remake themselves--thereby encouraging the reader to cheer the character's efforts.<br /><br />In addition to Mr. Grisham's skill with characters and plot, I enjoyed the Italian setting.  This is not a book to read if you are hungry--the descriptions of food cannot be endured on an empty stomach.  This is, however, a perfect book for those times when you don't need a challenging read, just great entertainment.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|im going to keep this simple. this movie is completely awsome. if you don't already have the VHS version, buy it. if u already do, dont bother. if this film was really digitally remastered, they did a crap job, as the picture quality doesn't look any better than the VHS version at all. as for the 5.1 surround sound, all it really is is the volume turned up alittle. <br /> <br />4 stars for the movie <br />2 stars for the dvd (at least the menu is cool)
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Michael Mann returns with this edgy masterwork of a movie about an ordinary taxi driver who gets caught into the world of a contract killer. It was like any other day and night for taxi driver Max, a superb Jamie Foxx (RAY, Held Up) Foxx picks up a grey haired mysterious man named Vincent, played with ferocious intensity by Tom Cruise (the upcoming War Of The Worlds, The Last Samurai), and after he picks him up things start to turn a little weird. Cruise is a hitman, who needs to kill 5 people he was hired to kill, so Cruise takes Foxx hostage. A nicely done character study with the two stars giving one of their best and believe me Foxx gives it all his best and when is Cruise ever dull as a villain?. Lots of action and excitment especially the scenes when Cruise shoots someone. Mark Ruffalo (In The Cut, 13 Going On 30) and Peter Berg (The Last Seduction, Aspen Extreme) play cops on the case. Ruffalo looks in good form and Berg looks tired. Also starring along for the ride is Jada Pinkett Smith (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions) who is the 5th mark on Cruise's list, Bruce Mc Gill (Animal House, Rosewood), Debi Mazar (Space Truckers, Nowhere), Bodhi Pine Elfman (Mercury Rising, Enemy Of The State), Javier Bardem (The Dancer Upstairs) and a quick and unbilled cameo by Jason Statham (The Transporter, Cellular) at the beginning. A fast ride worth taking. One of the best movies of the year.

B000696PWC|4.0|Kylie Minogue is a dance and pop icon like no other. From bubble-gum pop to electronica and techno-dance, she has compiled an immaculate catalog of brilliant music. Now in its third decade (!) her career has provided dance and pop classics such as \\"Loco-motion,\\" \\"Spinning Around\\" and \\"In Your Eyes.\\" Recent offerings such as \\"Love at First Sight\\" and \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" and new material including a collaboration with the equally brilliant Scissor Sisters only add to the strength of this hits record. But it is a single track that is worth the entire price of this CD. That song is \\"Confide in Me.\\" Shiver-inciting and timeless, this is one of the most deserving classics of 90's pop, and makes us grateful for the talent of this brilliant performer.  <br /> <br /> <br />

B00062ZE3U|3.0|Being a fan of Within Temptation soon after their album \\"Mother Earth\\" came out, I anxiously anticipated another release by this stunning band.  I am disappointed to say, however, that the long-awaited arrival of \\"The Silent Force\\" greets me with a sound which sounds a little too borrowed from other currently *cough popular (and usually for the reason of marketing rather than raw talent) bands.  It's rather a pain to say that too many of their songs have lost that ineffable quality which made Within Temptation something different than any other band out there.  Now, they sound too much like other bands I shall not mention... <br /> <br />That is not to say this isn't a quality album.  The recording is well done, vocals and instrumentation well-performed, but the whole album feels as if the band is coasting, having accelerated to a marked success with their former fans, and now only trying to maintain speed with the successor to \\"Mother Earth\\". <br /> <br />It is a sad day for this one fan of Within Temptation.
1400031567|5.0|Inspector Kurt Wallander of the Ystad police force in south Sweden has to solve his most challenging murder case yet: somebody is killing off elderly men using an axe to split their skulls and scalping them afterwards. It is clear that the killer is meticulously preparing his killings, staking out the victims and making sure nobody sees him. The team of policemen and -women seems to be always one step behind and even the profiler that has come to help them has problems coming up with a good profile of the killer. <br /> <br />What makes this book special is that the reader also gets the perspective of the killer: it soon becomes clear who he is and why he does what he is doing. This could be a major handicap as the book may loose most of its excitement of the \\"whodunnit\\", but here this is not the case. This is mainly due to the fact that Kurt Wallander is a full-fetched character with good and bad traits, doubts, hypochondric moments and moments of sudden,clear insight, making it a pleasure to follow how, in the end, he solves the case.
B000000OY9|1.0|Neil Young is a great song writer and I'm a huge fan of his.  <br /> <br />But the only reason you would ever buy this album is so that you can brag to your firends and family that you own the worst album ever made.  <br /> <br />The irony in all of this is that I actually have far more respect for Young after listening to this garbage. It amazes me that he can do something so awful and then come right back and release albums like Harvest Moon and Ragged Glory.  <br /> <br />If you are just getting into Young's music then do not buy this album until you have most (if not all) of the other albums he has done.
1558908382|5.0|I like to pretend that this is the unofficial sequel to Say Anything.  I mean John coulda run off and joined the military and become a hitman and all that.  It would be cool, and it's obvious he still knows kick boxing. <br />Also, one of the other reviewers said that Dan Akroyd was just playing himself.  I seriously doubt that Dan Akroyd is a homocidal maniac, control freak hitman in real life, but who knows?  I always thought he was a little shifty in Driving Ms. Daisy.
B000002OX7|5.0|If you are any kind of rock music fan at all then you must have this album in your collection. This album can be considered one of the greatest rock albums ever created. It is in the same category with anything The Beatles, Led Zep, Pink Floyd or The Stones have done. The fact that this entire album is basically scrapped tracks that were to be used for another rock opera just adds to it's greatness. Townshend is basically saying, \\"Here's a bunch of stuff we were working on that just didn't pan out the way I envisioned.\\" Boom! You have one of the greatest albums ever. <br /> <br />Another amazing thing about this album is that it is a re-re-lease. The original was much shorter and it was still one of the greatest albums ever without the extra stuff. Then they added the extra tracks. And then they added more. Brillant!
B00018D44U|5.0|See- I'm not a jazz snob; I'm a jazz pragmatist.  The more Norah Jones sells, the more Blue Note will be able to fund such great musicians as Don Byron and Jason Moran.  So please feel free to pick up Norah's latest album.  Even better get the new version that has bonus songs and a DVD.  Fine.  Norah isn't jazz, but she is the closest thing we have to a country-ish Dusty Springfield.  Who doesn't want a country-ish Dusty Springfield?  No one.  You probably love her.  Your partner surely does.  So does your mom.  Norah.  She's great.  Thanks to her, I was able to pick up the new Jason Moran album today- and it's great too.  It's just not your thing.  Thanks in advance for buying this instead!
B00063EMJ6|4.0|There is no way you can make a one CD greatest hits for Neil Young. Not even Decade, which is two CD, comes close. Two CD's doesn't even cover a quarter of the work he has done. You would have to have about 5-6 CD's to even come close to doing it justice (but leaving out anything from 'Landing on Water' would be a good thing). <br /> <br />This CD though has a good set of songs and if you are new to Young's music then it's a good start. I would also recommend 'Decade' but it's a bit dated and it really needs to be remastered for better quality. I would either start with those albums or just go buy 'Harvest' and 'After the Gold Rush.' Those were my first two Neil Young albums and I was not disappointed at all.
0060254920|5.0|I read this book as a child, and I remember being fascinated by its vivid illustrations and accompanying storyline. This book will awaken every child's imagination!
0385510454|3.0|\\"The Broker,\\" by John Grisham, NY, Doubleday, 2005  ISBN  0-385-51045-4 (hc), 357 p., author of 17 prior novels, herein concocts a fantasy story of a Washington DC lobbyist, lawyer and power broker Joel Backman who was Federally imprisioned for looting his company and clients of millions but, unexpectedly, after several years receives a pardon by an out-going US President but with provisio he's watched over in a foreign country (Italy); thus and so, he must learn their language and culture, etc.<br /><br />Unfortunately Joel had become both privy to and alone possessed high-level data files on a super secret satellite surveillance system that was a threat to Russia, China, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the US so he is targeted to be \\"taken out.\\"  The plot revolves around his ability to stay alive which requires he assimilate into the cultural ways and places of Italy and Switzerland, etc. using different identities.  To accomplish this he's assigned several teachers to tutor him in Italian 101, and thusly the reader is made familiar with terms as \\"Buon giorno\\" and \\"Grazie,\\" etc.<br /><br />This is an endowment for those readers who are either fully immersed in spy and counter-spy novels or who want to have the intimate savor of a foreign city, especially well-researched Bologna.  I found the book contrived, events predictable and not especially challenging so it was easy reading.  I found only one mispelled word on page 81.  And yes, there is no sex in this novel.  I think an inveiglement as photos and illustrations of the magnificent cities of Italy, particularly Bologna would have helped.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Remember \\"Animal House\\" and John Belushi's stupid character  Bluto? Remember what few lines of dialogue he uttered, but how his insanity made the movie? Remember the paper-thin plot, and how some scenes (shooting the horse?!) didn't make all that much sense? Here's your Animal House for the new century--Napoleon Dynamite.<br /><br />  Perhaps you have to have grown up with a certain type of \\"boy\\" (a stupid-acting brother, a joking dad, an annoying next door neighbor kid) in your household to really get the humor in this movie...and it helps to have grown up in a small rural town like Preston where absolutely NOTHING happens for months on end.  This is Napoleon's life, and while his life isn't as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be (where DID these people grow up? obviously, somewhere more exciting than I did), it's certainly one filled with everyday annoyances: dumb older brother still living at home, weird uncle, sexually suspect grandma, and an arrogant llama. He escapes via his imagination: he draws unreal animals and visualizes himself as a numchuck-swingin' stud.<br /><br />  The performances make this movie, as its plot is the visual equivalent of a to-do list. Jon Heder's brilliance as Napoleon, the nerd in search of imaginative life, complements perfectly  the rest of the cast's offbeat, but  very real, performances of everyday people doing everyday things.<br /><br />  Only someone  young could make this--Jared Hess is 24-- but I've met several middle-aged folks who said it was priceless, and one of the funniest films they've ever seen.<br /><br />  I think \\"Animal House\\" and \\"Napoleon D.\\" are the only two movies I could watch over and over again, and still laugh every time. In a world filled with sham and war and plastic things like Paris Hilton, a film like ND is a treasure.
B00005JKES|1.0|I absolutely agree with all the reviewers who have put it so well...WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE SERIES SET WITHOUT THE 2 HOUR PILOT MOVIE?!?!?

Enough said.
B000002LEU|5.0|Anything Joy Division gets at least the 4 star rating, in my book. This early retrospective was released shortly after Curtis's legendary suicide- it pulled tracks from all over the place. You get some earlier Warsaw material (No Love Lost, possibly their best early track), some Unknown Pleasures stuff, some Closer stuff, some singles (yes that one hit that everyone knows and loves...) So- If you're pressed for cash but want to delve into the visceral music of Joy Division... this is probably the best starting point, much better than 'Still,' which is recommended only for hard-core purists who want the live stuff on CD.<br /><br />I'd much, much, much, much, much, MUCH rather you pick up the 4 CD Heart and Soul box set (and some glue to keep it together) and just dive in (you will not regret it!), but I understand if you ain't got the almost 60 $s just lyin around, especially in the ice-age economic climate our generation has inherited.<br /><br />But this is good. Over fifteen songs for 11 bucks. Some not-so-great stuff on here- Glass and Novelty are as much duds as Curtis and Co. ever got... and some of my personal faves are ommitted- most notably Day of the Lords, Shadowplay (heresy! it was a show staple, great song, lyrically stark- maybe their definitive tune!) and Disorder (my first JD song), but then, in such cases you can't have everything... Take a chance!
B000777J2S|3.0|Antony and the Johnson's second release features more of Antony's graceful and passionate singing, which truly must be heard to be believed. This album is a collection of gentle, pleasing songs, most of which seem to drift along and then fade away. Antony's voice is perfectly matched to the accompanying strings and piano. At times, this arrangement might enter campy melodrama if Antony's delicate vibrato wasn't so intriguing. A very worthwhile album.
B00022LRXA|5.0|Largely considered to be one of the most talented (& Prolific) composers/producers of the last 20 years.  Brian Eno has helped shape the musical landspace not only through his incredible<br /><br />production skills for the likes of: Roxy Music, David Bowie, Harold Budd...etc, but his solo work, in particular his pearless \\"Ambient\\" albums & here....his Art-Rock, Experimental-pop albums, that were so far removed as anything else back when this was first released in 1977.<br /><br />\\"No One Receiving\\" is the sort of catchy Art-Rock/ White funk that \\"Talking Heads\\" would work similar magic on some 10 years later.  Energetic, bouncy guitar leading angular rhythms, that both musically and lyrically are probably more in debt to Avant-Garde than to conventional Pop music, abstract and fractured bass and tight funky guitar, mix wonderfully with skewed keyboards, with Eno's Vocals echoed & slightly distorted, that makes this track arguably one of the most innovative tracks on the album.<br /><br />\\"Backwater\\" without doubt is my favourite track, think a song based on a nautical theme, with warping horns, and insistent delay bass that is so simple in it construction, that its instantly memorable (in the same way \\"The White Stripes - Seven Nation Army\\" is a catchy simple bass).  With lyrical wordplay that seems to focus on being stranded, with Eno's singing \\"Black water,  There were six of us but now we are five.....We're all talking To keep the conversation alive\\", it's experimental-pop, like nothing else out there, Intelligent, funny, a fantastic sense of offbeat rhythm, and more incredible that this was made in the late-70's.<br /><br />\\"Kurt's rejoinder\\"  is a seductively melodic piece of work, again staying in the field of insular theatrical mood swinging rhythms, yet still remaining accessible enough for general public consumption, and despite Eno's penchant for electronic instrumentation, & eclecticism, across a range of disparate styles , it all connects brilliantly.And even though I'm still not sure what the lyrics are referring to: \\"Celebrate the loss of one and all, all, all And separate the torso from the spine Burger Bender bouncing like a ball, ball, ball So Burger Bender bargain blender shine\\".  (I have a feeling that it may refer to some poetic writing), it sits perfectly with the music.<br /><br />\\"Energy Fools the Magician\\" is one of a couple of instrumentals that make up the 10 tracks album.  And with Eno's being no stranger to instrumental music, you'd expect him to delivery the goods, and the moody late night 'Film noir' styled piece that invokes memory's of classic late-night black-and-white thrillers.  Although it is at odds with the pulsating, driving previous tracks. Auch, is it's mood and composition & elegance, that irrespective of it's complete change of pace, it remains sublimely crafted soundtrack music.<br /><br />\\"King's Lead Hat\\"...moves back into the experimental side of things with the Prog-rock/Art-Rock, that ups the tempo considerably and has an almost 'Punk' energy to it....brash & Confident, and a concise & tempered Rock-out moment on the album....such is Eno's mastery of structure, It remains Literate and Eno's urgent post -post punk style vocals yelling : \\"King's lead hat put the innocence inside her, it will come, it will come, it will surely come\\", turning the song into a soaring, anthemic chorus, as vibrant and ear-catching as anything else on the album.<br /><br />Rounding out the rest of the album is a collection of subtle, immaculately composed pop/instrumental songs.  For instance the gorgeous mood-evoking instrumental serenity of \\"By the River\\", or the detached pastoral emotional intensity of \\"Spider And I\\", that recalls some of the fine elegant moments of his \\"Another Green World Album\\", insofar as they both contain an amalgamation of truly beautiful music<br /><br />For anyone that is a Eno fan (casual or otherwise), this is an absolutely essential purchase, This was the period aroundthe mid-70's - early 80's when he was at his creative peak, making albums across genres, that would (in a lot of cases) go on to denfie them.  This would be his Experimental Pop / Art-Rock album, and although he wouldn't revisit this album, and produce similarly styled albums, this is without question, one of the finest Eno albums in his prolific career.  Absolutely essential....!!!
B000002UZ6|5.0|I do not understand why the reviewer below claimed Tina Turner is a Whitney Houston wannabe when Tina Turner's career started before Whitney was even born. And most of the hits on this compilation were released before Whitney Houston even hit it big. The review was ignorance in its purest form and it is the most pointless and ill-advised review I've ever seen. Its not good to make blanket statements about things you don't knmow.  :) <br /> <br />I am a huge fan of both Tina and Whitney and it is clear to anyone who knowsanything about them that they are totally different and do not try to copy each other in any way shape or form. They are two different types of superstars. Tina Turner has sold almost 70 million albums since the 80s, she has also sold more concert tickets than any other female artist in rock history (yes even more than Madonna - and that only includes the concert sales since the 80s.). Tina Turner also made history in 1988 by having the largest paying concert attendance (182,000 people in Rio Di Janerio) for a SINGLE PERFORMER (not just female) and was also put in the 1989 Guiness Book of Records for it. when Tina Turner did her final cocnert tour in 2000 she was the highest grossing tour act in America, grossing over $80 million and beating out even NSync, Britney and other very popular acts. <br /> <br />I can go on and on about Tina Turner's achievements that CLEARLY set her apart from Whitney Houston. Tina Turner came before Whitney, and Tina (as well as Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder and more) is one of the artists that helped pave the way for artists like Whitney to have the incredible success that she has had. Whitney has had an amazing career including  album sales of 120 million and 4 smash Silver Screen hits.  The older artists helped pave the way to help her be able to carve her niche in the world of popular music.  <br /> <br />This is a fantastic album. The new 4 tracks on this album at the time were very refreshing and added something new to the album. She does leave off a lot of hits such as \\"One of The Living\\". The DVD component to this is fantastic. For a more complete collection of her hits you are better off getting her new \\"All The Best\\" collection released in February 2005.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I can't believe I didn't get this sooner! I would see the promotions for it on television when I was eleven when it first came out, and I could kick myself for not getting before I became a teenager. A lot of my imagination has deteriorated within that time, but I'm really glad I ended up buying. Being a fan of \\"My Neighbor Tortoro\\" and \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" as a kid (which both inspired me majorly) I was wondering if Hayao Mayazaki was same one who created \\"Sprited Away\\". Doing a little research, I found out it was the same man, so I got the DVD expecting a fantasy, and got something out of my own imagination that got me back to remembering how I used to have so much fun with my own imagination back then. <br /> <br />Chihiro (american voiced by Daveigh Chase from The Ring) isn't too thrilled moving away to another town. New school, new friends, and a new house. It's not easy for someone who's just entering into her pre-teens. But when her parents accidentally take a wrong turn, the three find themselves in a seemingly abandoned amusement park. Her parents find some food left out in a restaurant, and when you see food you know someone has to be there. But when Chihiro comes back, she finds her parents have undergone a transformation, and strange shadows going up and down the sidewalks of the once abandoned place. Yet now that darkness has fallen, Chihiro knows something about the place is different, and if she wants to save her parents and herself, the only way out of the place is going straight through it. <br /> <br />I don't want to give away too much because if you give away something, you give it all away. Hayao Mayazaki must take these own ideas from his own childhood imagination, because his artwork, and where the plot goes is too amazing to be anywhere else. Being a wannabe author, Mayazaki's work has inspired, and I'm sure for any child who sees Spirited Away or any of his other breathtaking movies will be swept out of the world, and back into their own imagination. <br /> <br />Sprited Away is one of the more detailed and well thought out movies of his. Some of them are very easy to figure out, and some of them take a little while, but they deliver just as they always have. This one brings in a little bit of everything, and doesn't really need all explained, but as the story goes on, things fall together, and as a fantasy, you shouldn't think logical. When something comes out of the imagination, nothing is ever logical again. <br /> <br />The voice talents are amazing. I was surprised to find out that the highly acclaimed horror remake of a japanese thriller The Ring would have the same voice of Samara (for those of you who have seen it) in another remake. Coincidental? Daveigh Chase did good as little Chihiro, but of course the original is always better. I didn't listen to the japanese voice, but just in case I didn't like the new american voices, it's always good to switch on the subtitles, and change to the original japanese voices. That's what I really like about DVD's. <br /> <br />Spirited Away definitely has a good many laughs, but for kids who don't understand them it may be good, but for the adults, they'll be laughing until they can't breathe with the inside jokes all throughout the movie. The DVD also has a good variety of things to choose from unlike the sad DVD for my neighbor Totoro. I hope Mayazaki comes out with more like this, though. He's so highly underrated it's not even funny. At least there's a good number of us who appreciate him.
B00009V7T2|5.0|While much has been written about The Mars Volta, the weakness they are often ascribed is a prog-like overambitiousness both in sound and lyric. <br /> <br />The Mars Volta should be approached the same way as \\"Stairway to Heaven\\"-whether you want to read in the themes of the record or not is entirely up to you and what you want from a rock record. It is one badass collection of sounds, so if you just want a rock record, it is there for the taking. For those who want meaning, it is also there, hidden under admittedly dense, sometimes nonsensical prose; but it is there. While \\"In ritual contrition, the AM trinity fell upon asphyxia\\" perhaps qualifies as pretentious language, the meaning is pretty simple: some dudes found their friend had suffocated himself one morning, and they are hella sad about it and kinda blame themselves. There are a lot of \\"extra\\" words floating around, like the chorus of \\"Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed\\" (whoa!), but the meaning is pretty clear even if one only keeps an ear out for key phrases like \\"open wrist,\\" \\"nooses,\\" and \\"cadavers,\\" or adds the word \\"Russian\\" to song title \\"Roulette Dares.\\" Compare that with \\"If there's a bustle in your hedgerow,\\" and ooh, it makes me wonder if maybe The Mars Volta's excess verbiage isn't an improvement over the prototype, even if it is overambitious.  <br /> <br />Sonically, The Mars Volta does an admirable job of bringing the stoner rock of Led Zeppelin into the present. Like Zeppelin, De-Loused in the Comatorium is a hard rock album of considerable complexity and depth that uses the (now) standard cinematic bag of tricks: the gradual build, the droning riff repetition, the explosion from an extended daddle, the polyrhythmic mindmeld, etc. Even Plant's tight-pant-testicle-clamp of a falsetto is emulated by singer Cedric Bixler Zavala. While these are all retro styles and ideas, the sound is still decidedly modern, as the studio is used to its fullest extent. And, bottomline, it just rocks.<br /> <br />-Marc
B0002MB7QW|5.0|From the start, I have always loved this film. I only heard about it three days before it was supposed to come out on a preview, or else I would've never seen it. It seemed pretty neat to see the worlds weather go crazy, and also fairly original, but what one of the things I liked most about the film is that it gives an explanation of what was happening, and what could very well be happening in our near future.  <br /> <br />When Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) and his two partners are in the artic taking ice samples from Shelf B of the great ice glaciers, the whole shelf, the size of Rhode Island, suddenly breaks off. Not just because of this one shelf, but because of thousands of other glaciers melting and disrupting the flow of the nothern current, which depends on a balance of salt water and fresh water, these glaciers have caused an imbalance of fresh water, sending the earth into a weatherful and deadly apocalypse.  <br /> <br />Wtih tornadoes plowing through LA, baseball sized hail crashing through Tokyo, huge hurricane-like storms that freeze instead of rain, and below 100 degree temperatures, Jack must save his 17 year old son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is caught in New York with his friends, from the eye of the storm before he and Sam fall victim to the day after tomorrow.  <br /> <br />The fact that Shelf B in Antartica really did break off while they were writing the script, and wrote it into the movie was pretty scary. The fact that everything was pretty believable in the story made it good also. It doesn't get confusing, and nothing is ever left unexplained, except maybe why the ice storms which looked a lot like hurricanes were the most dangerous in the eye of the storm instead of safe, but it's easy to figure out. It gets so intensely cold in the eye of the storm for those types of storms that not even clouds can form there, and that also made a lot of sense.  <br /> <br />Before I saw it, I figured it would be like every other single apocalypse film, likeArmageddon, or The Core, is that they would eventually correct the problem in the end. This made it all the better that they didn't, and of course, in hollywood, they can do anything, but it's better that they didn't, or else I wouldn't have given this film even 3 stars. It's always better when you know the danger is still there, and it hasn't ended.  <br /> <br />I think what drew people to The day after tomorrow more than to other apocalyptic films mentioned above is that the events in the other movies aren't caused by us, they just happen somewhere along the line in the movies in a random place. The Day After Tomorrow was caused by us with the pollution we cause everyday by just driving to work or school, and might actually happen any time soon. Where I used to live in Arizona was around 96 degrees high in the summer when I was three and the pollution was moderate. Now that I'm fourteen and we've moved out of Arizona the pollution is so bad you can't even see the buildings, and now the high is up to 120 degrees!  <br /> <br />To the quality of the movie, the acting was okay by the major actors, but seriously, the best acting came from the co-stars, or the ones that aren't exactly known yet like Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok, and Tamlyn Tomita. Jake Gyllenhaal was good, but Dennis Quaid just didn't do as well as anticipated. The visuals are awesome, though. For anyone who didn't like the storyline or the movie itself cannot deny how good the action is when the storms get ready for their destruction. The freezing scenes are great, and everything is just amazing about this film in my opinion. You'll never look at the weather the same way again.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I am not joking when i say that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. I was laughing my ass off from start to end. The intro to this movie is perfect, AT A BAR. With Shaun his jackass of a friend Ed his girlfriend Liz, and David and Dye.

0789310627|4.0|Originally, I read about this series in National Geographic Travel.  I bought the London book as a gift for a seven year old who is a certified Harry Potter fan and, as a result, becoming quite the junior anglophile.  While this may not be an up-to-date trip to London (some of the landmarks mentioned are no longer there), it sparks the imagination and whets the young traveler's appetite.  The illustrations are fun and it doesn't stay on the shelf long at our house.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Thank u Slayer and thank u satan for this unholy masterpiece of metal. If u think that slayer is to loud or dont make sence and just make random noise ur kinda right but that makes them all the more great. Random screaming and loud noises sounds like a perfect slayer album which is what Reign in Blood is. This is there best album end of discusion. Its not like im saying Hell Awaits or Seasons in the Abyss are bad, im saying they dont compare with this album. When u first here the intro to angel of death u know that ur going for mind blowing trip, of speed metal. Kerry King who is one of the greatest METAL guitarists will literaly kill anyone who says this album is just nonscence with fast guitar playing. Tom Araya isn't the best vocalist but no one else could pull off the job on this album. I hate people that say Tom just yells and sings about satan, thats Slayer, you couldn;t put him in Led Zeppelin or &lt;a href=\\"ac%20dc\\" onmouseover=\\"window.status='AC DC'; return true;\\" onmouseout=\\"window.status=''; return true;\\">AC DC&lt;/a> because Tom Araya doesnt fit into that category of rock. which is why i get mad when people say Slayer sucks because of the voclas, there god dam SLAYER
B00005JMCW|4.0|As far as teenage movies go, this one did it for me. It's funny, the acting is good (hats off to Lohan to pull that off so convincingly), great bits of music.<br /><br />C.M. Murray seduced me and I'm 38!<br /><br />A light, uncomplicated, entertaining and enjoyable film that leaves you feeling good. For those nights when that's just what you need.
B000002KO1|5.0|Those prophetic words come from the breakthrough single \\"Brass In Pocket,\\" and they completely sum up the debut album from The Pretenders. This band of English scruffs backed up ex-pat Chrissie Hynde and made one of rock's all time great debut albums. At a time when female singers either had to be disco wailers or blues chicks (the sole exception being Heart), Chrissie completely smashed all the old stereotypes and marked a new era in female singers. She, along with vocalists like Pat Benatar and Patti Smith, made it cool for independent women to make music that was sexy because it wasn't sexual. Remember Pat Benatar's classic quote of \\"you break my heart and I'll kick your a**\\"? Chrissie was that to the n'th degree.<br /><br />\\"The Pretenders\\" mixed hard rock and pop sense so flawlessly that the band never again came close to matching it. From the sweet longing of \\"Brass In Pocket\\" to the cool dismissiveness of \\"Up The Neck\\" (\\"it was all very...run of the mill\\"), Chrissie delivered tough and tender in equal doses with full credibility. Having James Honeyman Scott throwing inventive riffs behind almost every song certainly helped, as did the undeniable power of Martin Chambers and Pete Farndon -- listen to his bass work on \\"The Wait\\" -- as a rhythm team. (And dammit, why did James and Pete have to OD themselves? When will we ever learn?)<br /><br />All the chemistry was in perfect coordination here. Even the one moment when Nick Lowe steps in for producer, a cover of The Kinks' \\"Stop Your Sobbing,\\" can't break the synergy of this album. It remains a timeless debut, standing tall alongside of first efforts of the period from Tom Petty, Elvis Costello, Joe Jackson and The Cars.<br /><br />And I join in the masses that beg the remaster gods for a decent reissue of this and the rest of The Pretenders' catalog.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I was never a fan of Brad Pitt but he made this movie. He was superb as a fearless warrior. Can't say the same about Orlando Bloom as a Paris. He came across as too effeminine and the thought of him as a fighter just doesn't fly. Yes, this movie is hardly historicly accurate but still, very enjoyable to watch.

0716703440|4.0|This book is known as the 'bible' of General Relativity or 'MTW'.    People with different preparation will perceive MTW in different ways:    The beginners in GR very often will feel that the book is a good reference and shows 'properties' of the defined objects instead of explaining the logical necessity of demanding such properties. My first course in GR was based on that book and although I learned some 'index gymnastics' from it, very often I had questions of the type 'where does this come from, why is it defined this way'. Often I would read about something like 'affine parameter' and I would not understand its importance at all.     For beginners I recommend the books from J.Hartle, B. Schutz, D'Inverno, W. Rindler, S. Carroll and R. Wald in order of increasing abstraction (and decreasing usefullness for beginners). I am currently in the middle of course based on the Carroll's book and I understand things I have never ever been able to understand from the 'bible' like the fact that we may define different connections but only one of them is metric compatible and we CHOOSE to work with it, or that we CHOOSE to work with a torsion free connection, or that reparametrizing a geodesic may not give you back a geodesic (in relation to the affine parameter remark above) ... Such facts are either not clearly spelled in the 'bible' or they are digged in somewhere 300 pages away ...    Once you are past your first (or better second) course in GR, that book will be an invaluable reference for you with plenty of examples how to apply different computational and theoretical techniques in GR.    The reviewers that give it high rating are obviously either experienced in the field or are begginners that value a book only because of the well-known authours.     The book is really a titanic effort to compile all relevant pieces of info into one thick volume   BUT PLEASE PLEASE think carefully before you recommend it for INTRODUCTION to General Relativity !!!

0790729628|5.0|This is a great movie. It stands well by itself, of course, but it also taps into a lot of movie-making history and brings it up to date.<br /><br />The plot is about a manhunter whose job is to take down escaped slaves, the factory made \\"replicants\\". A replicant is human in just about all ways except the serial number and a built-in expiration date of just a few years. This makes for lots of good chasing and shooting in the movie's bleak cityscape. The Tyrell Corporation, maker of the replicants, keeps improving their product line, up to experimental model Rachel. She, of course, is the romantic interest and puts the last edge on the moral issue at hand: how human is human enough?<br /><br />The setting is updated noir, with all the standard fixtures. Harrison Ford is the hard-boiled detective (or close enough), Rachel tends towards 40s fashions, and the vastly wealthy tycoon is at the center, above the law but not above justice. Ridley Scott has captured the real noir atmostphere, where everything is dirty. The extortionist police chief, with the bottle in his desk drawer, is dirty. The city is dirty. The slaving business is dirty, especially the \\"entertainment\\" slaves stocked like any other commodity at the military outposts. The air is dirty, always smoke or grey rain. Even the information environment is polluted. No matter where you go, ads, propaganda, automated voices, and flashing lights pound pointlessly into your awareness, following you indoors through the windows. Even more than in the \\"Alien\\" movies, Scott got the mood right this time.<br /><br />Most of all, there's the question: how human does a being have to be? \\"Do you ever make a mistake? Have you taken the test yourself?\\" Would an autistic child pass the test, or any other person on the edge of the bell curve? The situation, human bodies and minds built on a factory floor, is fiction. The fact, however, is that we really do have levels of technical control over life that were incomprehensible even ten or twenty years ago, and growing.

B0002EXH40|5.0|Although many of the reviews on this site for \\"Youthanasia\\" are good, many critics and fans saw this as a letdown. Even though it went all the way to #4 on the charts, many fans left after this album hit the shelves. I think that Megadeth's best lineup is featured here with Mustaine (rhythm guitar, soloist), Marty Friedman (lead guitar, soloist), Dave Ellefson (bass), and Nick Menza (drums), and they sound as good as ever.<br /><br />1. Reckoning Day 9/10- Heavy, with a memorable riff. A great starter, but could have used a longer solo.<br />2. Train of Consequences 10/10- One of the biggest hits off \\"Youthanasia\\" is also one of the most memorable with a driving beat and decent vocals.<br />3. Addicted to Chaos 10/10- Another good song with great soloing by Mustaine and Friedman as well as a memorable chorus.<br />4. A Tout Le Monde 10/10- The ballad off of the album was a major MTV hit. Has excellent lyrics and a memorable, melodic solo by Friedman.<br />5. Elysian Fields 8/10- Has a memorable chorus, but needed a better guitar solo.<br />6. The Killing Road 9/10- A heavier track that once again has great soloing by the guitarists.<br />7. Blood of Heroes 8/10- This one is shows a darker side of Megadeth, not that the other songs were happy or anything.<br />8. Family Tree 8/10- Decent enough song, but poor verses keep this from \\"10.\\"<br />9. Youthanasia 7/10- The title track is surprisingly dull, at least compared to the rest of the songs on this album.<br />10. I Thought I Knew It All 8/10- Good song, but the chorus is somewhat repetitive and it gets annoying.<br />11. Black Curtains 10/10- Awesome riffs and great solos make this song one of the album's best. It's a shame that it was so overlooked.<br />12. Victory 6/10- Probably the only song on the album that can be classified as \\"filler.\\" The lyrics are just a cheap way to include a bunch of Megadeth's past song titles in the verses. To their credit they do include a four-part guitar solo at the end.<br /><br />As for the bonus tracks, they are actually worthwhile for a change, (as opposed to pointlesss demos). \\"Absolution\\" is a great instrumental (I wish Megadeth would do more of those) which eventually evolved into the excellent \\"Trust\\" off of \\"Cryptic Warnings.\\" \\"New World Order\\" is also great and it would have been nice if they had used it on \\"Cryptic Warnings\\" to replace any song, except maybe \\"Trust.\\" The remaster changed very little though, so it's not worth getting the remaster unless you want some extra Megadeth songs. There was very little activity in the metal world at this time with Dream Theater and Pantera being the only ones to release decent metal albums in this time period (alterna-metal ruled at this time and does not count as true metal because alterna-metal sucks). It was unfair that so many fans left Megadeth after this because this was a strong release, with it's only problem being a lack of standout tracks.a change, (as opposed to pointlesss demos). \\"Absolution\\" is a great instrumental (I wish Megadeth would do more of those) which eventually evolved into the excellent \\"Trust\\" off of \\"Cryptic Warnings.\\" \\"New World Order\\" is also great and it would have been nice if they had used it on \\"Cryptic Warnings\\" to replace any song, except maybe \\"Trust.\\" The remaster changed very little though, so it's not worth getting the remaster unless you want some extra Megadeth songs.

I found it very empowering that we can break \\"old agreements\\" we have with ourselves and learn and apply these new ones. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the thought provoking wording and imagery in this book.  I found the authors perspective very inspiring.     <br /> <br />This is a wonderful book that I return to often. <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|The flagship song for this CD is Jesus of Suburbia, imo.  It is by far one of the best 9+ minute songs I've ever heard. <br /> <br />The entire album goes together perfectly.  In some ways it reminds me of Pink Floyd The Wall, not in the style of the music, but in how the entire album flows together like a large music opera/movie.  The entire album could be a soundtrack for a movie. <br /> <br />This is one of the best overall albums I have heard in a long long time.  The only shame is that since Jesus of Suburbia so long, that it probably won't be released on the radio in its entirety.
B000083E79|4.0|You gotta get this collection, because there is just so much here...the early \\"Sonny\\" material, the \\"story\\" songs like \\"Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves\\", the \\"movie music\\", as well as the dance club-themed modern pieces.  For many of her fans, Cher has been dispensing wisdom, solace and fun for over thirty years, and although some reviewers insist on calling her a \\"diva\\", I think she's more like an eccentric aunt who has really wacky clothes and hangs with even wackier friends.  This may be her \\"farewell\\" tour, but the music will endure forever.
B0000041LA|5.0|I have this recording of all five Prokofiev concertos. The rapport between soloist and conductor is first rate. The fact that Andre Previn is an excellent pianist helps mould a great understanding and the fact that both soloist and conductor got on so well helps so much. <br />  Vladimir Ashkenazy played all the concertos very brilliantly.He doesn't overcook the interpretation and it sounds better for it.His recording of the second concerto is amazing. Remember he used that with his New York debut in the fifties with Bernstein. I find this collection to be such an achievement. I thoroughly recommend this CD.
0783227434|5.0|The undisputed king of corny horror goes to sam raimis horribly brilliant flick. While evild dead (1, and 2) seem almost like the tone is saposed to be horror( but really is just funny) aod is geared more or less to a more spoofish kind of schlock film that lets the bruce cambell i have come to love make his appearnce. His script in itself could create a brand new die hard movie its got so many bad one-liners. The special affects are not too special and the plot isn't  exactly oscar award winning stuff. So whats so great about it? IT'S F***#@ING HILLARIOUS. The true definition of a cult classic  <br />..this movie has stood the test of time  <br />..very very low budget  <br />...and yet it doesnt matter because its brilliant in its own way. go ahead and check it out if you havent already.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Fans of At The Drive-In were heartened when two of its members teamed up to form the even further forward thinking The Mars Volta. Produced by Rick Rubin, A&R'd by Nirvana A&R guy Gary Gersh, and helped out by Flea and John Frusciante of the Chilli Peppers, De-Loused in the Comatorium should have been a \\"hit\\" record in the alternative rock world. Instead, those in the know get to enjoy the psychedelic, choppy riffs while trying to figure out the concept behind this conceptual album.

B000002UAC|4.0|This was the Beatles' 2nd album in the UK.  Like the debut, Please Please Me, most of this album was recorded in one session.  The cover was inspired by the works of Astrid Kirschnerr, whom the Beatles became friends with while in Hamburg.  I heard a few takes of \\"Hold Me Tight\\" where Paul's voice cracks slightly on take 23, \\"Let me go on... ohbloodyhell!\\" (he was even the perfectionist back in 1963).  Of course, the engineer (running out of patience) screams \\"24!\\" as the Beatles seem to get it right on the take used.  On With the Beatles, the Beatles give a nod to Motown with their readings of \\"Please Mr. Postman,\\" \\"Devil in Her Heart\\" sung by George), \\"Money (That's What I Want\\" and \\"You Really Got a Hold on Me\\" (I recall the latter being on the Beatles' animated series, produced by Al Brodax, where a snake is tightly coiled around Ringo).  The Motown influence would be realized on original songs like \\"Not a Second Time\\" (part of a trilogy of \\"no 2nd chance if you blow it the 1st time\\" songs, including \\"You Can't Do That\\" and \\"Run For Your Life\\" on later albums; John sang lead on each of the 3) and \\"All I've Got to Do\\" (with jazz progressions on the intro).  This album also features George's writing debut \\"Don't Bother Me,\\" a slightly bitter lament over unrequited love, which if he didn't get back, he certainly wasn't going to give any other girl a piece of his affections.  \\"Little Child\\" is a simple song which recalls the influence of skiffle (folk and blues) with a harmonica played by John.  \\"All My Loving\\" became famous as the 1st song the Beatles sang on Ed Sullivan.  Paul croons sweetly \\"Till There Was You\\" from the 1950's show The Music Man.  Ringo sings \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" which, though written by John and Paul wrote this, was 1st recorded by the Rolling Stones as their 2nd single.  George sings lead on Chuck Berry's \\"Roll Over Beethoven.\\"  Finally, opening the album, John sings lead on the catchy and exquisite \\"It Won't Be Long\\" with an impressive closing chord progression.  In the USA and Canada, most of these songs would make their way onto Meet the Beatles (which used the same cover photo) and others would find their way onto The Beatles' 2nd Album, both released the following year.
B00005YXZH|4.0|LOOOOVE WILCO! COMLETE MUSIC FREAK HERE! This cd is good... But it doesn't hit me like the 1st 3 cd's. \\"Being There\\" is the ultimate. I would compare it to The White Album, Sgt. Pepper, Born to Run, Blood on the Tracks, etc. Everytime you listen you hear something different. Top 5 favorite cd's. <br /> <br />Of course the critics loved Yankee, so it propelled Wilco to the national spotlight. And I couldn't be more happy for Tweedy and crew. I think Tweedy could can stand next to Springsteen, Dylan, & Lennon any day. He is solid. Soooo creative. He deserves so much recognition. <br /> <br />Yankee is good.... Pot Kettle Black moves me the most. This tune is super cool. I've heard live versions and I kind of wish they didn't fade out on the cd. Tweedy really puts himself into the song towards the end. I could listen to the last minute of the song a million times. It rocks.... <br /> <br />Jesus, Etc and Heavy Metal Drummer are great, too. The other songs I can take or leave.  <br /> <br />I'm sooo happy it put Wilco on the map. I just like the 1st 3 cd's so much more. But who am I....? I'm just a fan......

B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta is my new favorite band.  They are the best thing I have heard in a very long time.  Do yourself a favor and check this cd out.  Hopefully their new cd lives up to this one.  I don't doubt it will though.
0385486804|5.0|In August 1992, a lone, unidentified man was found starved to death inside an abandoned bus, miles from the nearest road, deep in the Alaskan bush.  This spawned a small media blitz that eventually identified the man as Christopher McCandless.  However this left a bigger mystery of who Christopher McCandless was. <br /> <br />For those who are familiar with Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air, this is a different book from the start.  Into Thin Air was a white-knuckled ride with Krakauer as he attempts to survive Everest.  This book is more of a subtle mystery as Krakauer tries to piece together the evidence of the months that led up to the discovery of McCandless' body.  The tragedy of his death is established but the suspense is in discovering who Christopher was. <br /> <br />What Krakauer does in this book is fill in the picture by talking to the people who encountered Christopher in his last months.  The image that comes out is not a genius or a messiah, but an intelligent young man who is at odds with the society he was raised in.  And at the same time Krakauer describes a tribe of men who just don't seem to fit into our society and look for life on the fringes and beyond. The book is brilliant in capturing this spirit, I'm sure in large part because this spirit is shared by the author. <br /> <br />It's not an action adventure like Into Thin Air, but it is just as hard to put down.  If you haven't read this one, do yourself and favor and get a copy.  Mine is well dog-eared from being passed around. <br />

6305736650|5.0|I went on Amazon.com the other day looking for the movie \\"Casablanca\\".  I thought it would be interesting to take a look first at the lowest rated reviews for the movie.  I mean, I thought \\"Who could possibly give it 1-star and why?\\"  I was at first miffed to see several 1-star reviews stating that the movie was painfully boring and some even stated that they had to fast forward through it to get to the more \\"exciting\\" parts.  But then on second thought, I'm not surprised at all.    First let me say first that \\"Casablanca\\" is without doubt one of the great classics in American film making.  It's a movie that has stood the test of time and one that I can watch any day of the week and know I'm going to enjoy it all over again.  It is without question one of the top 20 Hollywood movies of the 20th century.  But for some folks, it fails to please.    You see the \\"problem\\" with Casablanca is it lacks all of the features that makes today's modern movies \\"great\\".  Let me elaborate.  Perhaps it would have been better to have Bogie swear like a trooper throughout the movie, because, I mean, that's how people really talk isn't it?  And folks want realism.  Or perhaps if the director had only included a torrid bedroom scene between Bogie and Bergman with frontal nudity to kinda' spice things up a bit.  That sure would have made it \\"exciting\\". Or perhaps they should have actually shown Capt. Renault (Claude Raines) having his way with a few of the local women in order to get their exit visas out of Casablanca.  I mean to just loosely imply it is to miss out on a great bit of moviemaking.  Or instead of just showing some feeble scuffle between the Peter Lorre character and the local police before he's arrested, why not have them chase him though the streets of Casablanca in some break-neck car chase scene, only to have his car catapult through the air and be killed in a deafening explosion and fireball.  That surely would have made the movie 5-stars! And finally, at the end of the film, instead of having Bogie just shoot Major Strasser in some bloodless, antiseptic scene, they could have spiced it up a bit with lots of blood and splatter!!    My point in all of this sarcasm is that unlike today's films, \\"Casablanca\\" couldn't have shown any of those things nor did it need to.  It relied on great acting, tight direction and a plot that actually made you think.  And it did that extremely well.  Unfortunately for some folks today to have to sit through two hours of actual meaningful dialogue without the ubiquitous chase scene, nudity, profanity and violence is too much for them to bear.  That's boorrring, they say.  In conclusion, I say \\"Casablanca\\" is one of greatest movies put on film for all the right reasons.  It is a movie that Hollywood would never make today.  Sadly, I think they have forgotten how.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is one of the best musicals I have ever listened to.  I have to warn you though that it is addicting.  I am listening to it right as I write the review and learned ALL (19) songs the first day I got the cd.  I am going to give each song a rating out of 10 so you know what to expect.    1. No One Mourns the Wicked-8/10 because after hearing them sing No One Mourns the Wicked like 10 times you get a little annoyed but when Kristin Chenoweth (G(a)linda) sings it is Fabulous.    2. Dear Old Shiz-5/10 because it is not very important but I still listen to it.  You do have a skip button :)    3.The Wizard and I-10/10 because Idina Menzel (Elphaba) rocks this song.  Carole Shelley's (Madame Morrible) part is boring but Idina starts singing and you forget about Carole's part.    4.What Is This Feeling-10/10 because Kristin and Idina are both fabulous in this duet.  It is very funny and they both are very talented.    5.Something Bad-6/10 because it can get very annoying but it is funny as well.  I don't feel that people give William Youmans (Dr. Dillamond) a chance because he plays a goat in Wicked and only sings this song.  Idina sings a little at the end and she is so great.    6. Dancing Through Life-10/10 because Norbert Leo Butz (Fiyero) is so great.  His voice is sexy and he makes you want to dance to this marvelous song.  This is the longest song but gets most of the cast singing.  Michelle Federer (Nessarose), Christopher Fitzgerald (Boq), Norbert and Kristin are all wonderful in this.  While Idina doesn't sing much in this it is still wonderful.    7.Popular-10/10 because Kristin is great in this solo song.  She is just great.  This part was written for her (I'm not kidding because they wrote it around her) and she shines in it.    8. I'm not that Girl- Idina outshines herself in this slow balled.  She is incredible beyond words.  Bravo Idina.    9.One Short Day-8/10 because it is more of an ensemble song and kinda corny.  I love it though.  Yet again Kristinand Idina are great.    10.A Sentimental Man-7/10 because it is kind of boring.  Joel Grey (The Wizard)is not given a chance to really make it better.  He is good for what he has to work with.    11.Defying Gravity-100/10 because it is the best song on the whole cd.  Yet again Kristin and Idina are great.  Idina shows off her range and blows you away.  She deserved her Tony that she won for the portrayl of Elphaba.  Just GREAT AND AWESOME.  Great before the intermission.    12.Thank Goodness- this song opens act 2 and I give it 9/10 because Kristin again is amazing.  The beginning is a little slow but when Kristin starts singing you forget about that.    13.Wonderful-8/10 because Joel Grey yet again is great for what he is working with.  Idina sings a little and she is amazing.     14.I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)- 9/10 Although Idina sang the first Kristin sings this very good.  It is only :50 long that's why I gave it a 9/10    15.As Long As You're Mine-10/10 because Idina and Norbert are wonderful.  This is a love song and they sound as though they are in love with one another.  It is a great song.    16. No Good Deed-10/10 because Idina blows you away in this song as well.  She is incredible and shows us her beautiful range again.    17. March Of The Witch Hunters-8/10 because I like the one liners that some people have in this song.  I also like the Tin Man and Lion connection.  It is an ok song but most people don't like it as much as I do.    18.For Good-100/10 because Kristin and Idina make this a big 'ole cry fest.  It is an amazing duet that will make you cry every time you hear it.  They are both wonderful in this song.    19.Finale-7/10 because it is almost like No One Mourns the Wicked combinened with For Good and isn't very long.    I encourage you to listen to the part of the tracks you can listen to up top and then buy this cd.  The whole family will enjoy this from your youngster who is 8 to your elderly family member who is 80.  It is an incredible cd.  It can also help girls who's self esteem is low because Elphaba is someone they can relate to.  I can not believe that Avenue Q beat out this wonderful musical at the Tony's.  Although Idina won best actress in a musical and deserves it.  Go out and buy the cd, you won't regret it.
0316172324|4.0|Gladwell without doubt understands the workings of the subject he explores in this monograph. From the moment I read its introduction, which described the curious case of some art experts identifying a fake kouroi (type of ancient Greek statue) at first glance, I \\"knew\\" (or \\"thin-sliced,\\" as Gladwell puts it) the book would be fascinating. <br /> <br />As is well publicized, the book is a collection of stories of how first impressions knowingly or not dictates our decision-making. Each chapter consists of a major case study, adorned with smaller cases that support the major one. In its insightfulness in pointing out details of everyday behaviors that easily go neglected the book resembles Atul Gawande's recent Complications (a reflection on everyday practices of surgeons). In its structure and in its roundabout way in implicating the human condition the book is reminiscent of Oliver Sacks' clinical tales. <br /> <br />Such similarity notwithstanding there is a difference between Blink and Gawande's or Sacks' books that shouldn't be overlooked. The subjects for each chapter of the essays of latter two were more or less independent; for Blink, the entire book is about rapid cognition. As such readers are subject to ask for more than a compendium of interesting tales. Examples of questions one might ask are: What percentage of our everyday decisions is based on rapid cognition? Are there particular fields/professions in which decisions are more prone to be dictated by first impressions? If so, why? What is a good criterion that can be used in determining whether to make the most of our brain's thin-slicing capability or to be wary of it? <br /> <br />It was indeed interesting to learn about our brain's capabilities and the advances in psychological science that studies this capability. But it was Gladwell's mastery in story telling that was the most impressive.
0061015725|3.0|Prey is a novel about the possible consequences of nanotechnology going wrong. Crichton very cleverly describes how nanotechnology, molecular biology and computer technology (AI) will fuse in the nanotech world. He does careful research and the arguments are presented by the protagonist who is a project manager in the nanotech world.  <br /> <br />The book describes how one application of nanotech will be based on a Predator-Prey system, which will be modeled upon animals in the real world (like a colony of ants). Such systems may not have a central intelligence (like humans or a company) but instead have collective intelligence based on simple rules. It is a largely a tightly written book, quite well paced and the characters are real. The appendix at the end provides references to seeming interesting material on nanotech - both technical and social from scientists working in the field. Every book I have read written by Crichton has been interesting and I have learned something from it. But then it is just my bias towards someone who is a Dr from Harvard and very well travelled? In any case, I enjoyed it and look forward to the next one!  <br />
B000002OX7|5.0|Hey I'm here, I'm here to tell you that my name is listed in <br />the cd. Cool, I get 2 screams durring the run. Have you heard <br />that this is the who's best album yet?
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is, by far, the most prefect work of cinematic excellence ever created. I submit that there is nothing in this movie that could be taken out and have the film remain as impeccable in quality. It is endearing, universal, and the best movie I've ever had the pleasure of watching 100 times and counting.
B00001OH7P|4.0|I have all but two of David Bowie albums (I'm in the process of finding the out of print versions of those).  Too many so called Bowie fans overlook his huge catalog of amazing albums because they are stuck in this \\"ziggy is his best\\" mindset.  I love all of Bowie's albums, about half of them I like more than Ziggy.  Have you ever heard Ashes To Ashes on the Scary Monsters album?  Well trendy ziggy fans, I think he's talking to you.  Ziggy is dead!  Yeah it's a classic, but so are most of his albums including his most recent album Reality, which I prefer over Ziggy any day.  I don't need to do a track by track review of the album because it has been done by many others and there is nothing I could say to add to what's been said.  Give all of Bowie's music a fair chance before you settle for just Ziggy as your top pick.  Bowie has always been and continues to be an inovator of new sounds and styles.  Ziggy has been dead for over 30 years and will never come back from the grave.  Get over it trendy fans, time to move past june of 1972 when Ziggy was released now, it's 2005.
0684859106|4.0|This cookbook is excellent if you're looking to make some classic, old-fashioned desserts, and caters to a variety of sweet-teeth.  <br />Unfortunately, there is no nutritional information in the book, which was the primary drawback for me.  While it is easy to conclude the many of the recipe's are high on sugar and fat, it would be nice to have a clear idea of exactly what I'm serving to my guests. <br />My other criticism is in the binding of the book - it's bound more like a novel, and won't lay flat unless you weigh it down.  This makes it difficult when you're making an unfamiliar dish, and need to consult the book often.  <br />Overall, this book is good for more advanced bakers with a taste for sweet, old-style desserts.  The lack of nutritional information is a problem, but these dishes are probably best classified as infrequent treats rather than regular after-dinner rotations.
B000002JOH|5.0|This might as well have been the best of pantera album.  every song on the CD deserved to be on it.  I guess you cant put all of them on it though, because if you did you would have to put all the songs off \\"cowboys from hell\\" and \\"far beyond driven\\" on it too.  Thats about all i have to say besides R.I.P Dimebag you will be missed.
B000005RS0|5.0|Tina Turner's 1984 album Private Dancer was such a fabulous effort from her!  Every song she just tears it up! She can do rock songs so very well, especially on I Might Have Been Queen, Show Some Respect, 1984, and Steel Claw.  Let's Stay Together sounds like she could have recorded it in Memphis with Al Green watching her sing it in the studio. It's true respect to Al and his '70s soul.  Tina has said in countless interviews that she didn't like What's Love Got to Do With It at first, but the whole world does and especially the Grammys when they gave her a best song award for it! A No. 1 hit and a very addictive reggae sounding rhythmic song it is!  I still love the dramatic closing song, Private Dancer and its sexy, jazzy feel.  It is still one of her best performances.  One of the '80s best albums that fully expressed the vibes and excesses of that decade.  And Tina's finest and best effort to date!!!
B0000AC8N4|5.0|Dexter is in great form here and rate the record as highly as his sentational \\"Go\\" album. Buy it and and you will enjoy this great music.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Though I own both of the other Buffy soundtracks, I'm always a bit let down by them. Sure, the music can be very cool, and I like listening to the album, but I would rather hear songs sung by the characters; that would be more relevant and personal for me. So I imagine that they are singing the soundtrack songs; see my review for the 1999 album. <br /> <br />I may not be the only one who feels that way, because here is the Buffy musical I've been craving. Fans of the show know what a great episode this one was. But fans of musicals should also tune in, even if they've never seen the show. While the CD is not as good as watching and getting the whole experience, it is satisfying. <br /> <br />As a musical, \\"Once More With Feeling\\" has decent songs from first-time songwriter Joss Whedon. The music is varied (I hate homogenous muscials.Yes, Lloyd Webber, I'm looking at you!) and the lyrics are surprisingly clever and mostly devoid of lame, clunky rhymes. And the songs actually advance the plot! Wow! The musical numbers are funny, pensive, dramatic and sad when they need to be. I guess it's so perfect because the show's creator wrote it for the show. <br /> <br />The extra tracks, mostly score, are nice but mostly padding. It doesn't matter because the musical is so good. <br /> <br />In short, fans of Buffy should have this album, if for no other reason, to hear their favorite characters sing their hearts out in a touching way. Fans of musicals will not be disappointed. This is a good bet, and I highly recommend it.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|Devils Night is 10X better then this album. It does have a couple of good tracks but it is no where near as good. Pethetic cd 2 come out of aftermath. Pick it up guys
068987474X|1.0|While making some good points about some men in this world (and that these few are not honest enough) this book fails to explain that not all men- in fact most men- are not like this.  They can be afraid to ask you out and to call- just as woman can be.  Every man out there is not like this.  'The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys' seems to be a book to tell woman to just stop after the first try, or \\"If at first you don't succeed, don't try again\\"!  This is giving woman the wrong impression, and possibly making some feel like the supressed gender. Sure, there are other men out there if he is not into you...but this does not mean that every situation woman run into will be like this. <br /> <br />This book is not about woman being in denial if they do not find the reading amusing and enlightening.  Some woman are in denial, and sometimes there is a reason to pursue.  What do you have to lose?  There is always someone else.  This does not mean be desperate, or be in denial that he doesn't like you, or give up right away.  If you are so confused, ask how they feel.  Do not give up is you want something, you may never know- but do not push someone when they do not want it, and push them farther away. <br /> <br />It is impoper that a man basically says 'all men' are like this and 'do not try', when it is a smaller group.  What kind of advice is that?  Who has the right to say what an individual man is thinking?  Every person is different.  Men do not have to make the first move.  It is nice when men do, but it is also great when woman do.  Woman who belive every myth about the men they have met who have not asked them out at the moment they expected to, and believe in this sort of karma- this is the book for you.  Not every man wants to have sex right away, or call you every minutes- some men have vaules and respect.  My advice: there are much better men out there who know about all the differnt kinds of guys, not one who knows of just small percentage.  Guys might be feeling the same way the ladies are- asking all these same questions.  No one can read minds.  You never know until you try. <br />
0385510454|1.0|Early works kept me on the edge of my seat.  This tale is dry and predictable.  Where is the suspense, the drama.  I miss the \\"I can't put this down\\" feeling that I used to get from this author. Grisham may need to take a break.  We deserve better.
B00005JMYI|1.0|I was sooo excited watching the previews for this movie.  I thought that the anchorman character and Will Ferrell fit like a glove...Instead it fit like OJ's glove. <br /> <br />This movie stinks.  The humor was left out along with, plot, style and basic entertainment.  I cannot remember being so bored during a comedy movie, and especially during a movie with Will Ferrell.  Usually all this guy has to do is talk and I'm smiling.  Not the case in this movie.   <br /> <br />I'm not going to get into the plot of this movie, because I don't think it would persuade anyone to watch the movie.  That is also not my intent in writing this review.  I want people to lower their expectations of this movie.  Maybe that will give it a chance.  I will admit, I had high expectations and I fell on my face with this one.   <br /> <br />Ferrell fans..regardless of what I say, you will watch this movie.   <br /> <br />Anyone else...rent \\"Elf\\" instead.  At least that movie is good.
B000084T18|4.0|After a unsuccessful stint with columbia records 50 Cent signed with eminem's shady aftermath and dropped a decent album. It wasn't as good as other debuts like &quot;2pacalpyse Now&quot; or &quot;Ready to Die&quot; but it was good.

B0001CLGFK|2.0|There is no question that David Lynch has a \\"vision\\". As his first film, Eraserhead demonstrates that he had the ability and skill to deliver this nightmarish vision to the screen very early on. He is a master at manipulating viewers through minimal mise-en-scene, slow pacing and haunting sound design. What can be questioned is whether or not this nightmare is a trip you want to take. What every other review fails to mention is that this movie is really gross! Not that I have a weak stomach, I actually make it a point to find strange and disturbing flicks (David Cronenberg, Takashi Miike, etc).But I do have limits, and, any type of gore involving babies usually is beyond my limit. That being said, this movie is not for those in planned parenthood. Eraserhead and other films like The Omen, Thirteen, Children Of The Corn and Rosmary's Baby are like contraceptive cinema; Movies that will make you never want to have a kid. Regardless, I have no plans of having children anytime soon but the movie did disturb me and even made me a little queasy. The film's technical achievements are exceptional and if you like weird movies like myself, than this is one of the crown jewels. But I can't say i would recommend the film simply because, although it is strange, i wouldn't call this nightmare an enjoyable experience.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|I love this movie.  In fact, it was the first movie I ever purchased (VHS) many moons ago.  I first saw it in a theater with a hard-bitten financial-analyst friend of mine (male, straight).  I'm an engineer (male, straight).  We are not weepy types.  We were both moved very much by this movie.  I don't agree at all that this is a chick-flick.<br /><br />This is a movie aimed at adults.  If you want:  constant action, simplistic plot, black-and-white relationships, car crashes, shoot outs (OK, it does have some crashes and shooting), then you probably want to look elsewhere.  Casablanca, to which this movie has been contrasted, (though a good movie) could fall into the category of propaganda:  produced during WWII, everyone conformed to the main line.  Real people had real lives going on during WWII.<br /><br />I find that the negative reviews of this movie fall into two categories:  1) those who are (terribly) morally offended by extra-marital affairs, and 2) those that can't follow a complex plot and set of characters.  If you can see beyond those issues, and you like a good, complex tragedy, you should enjoy this movie.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie.  The cinematography is gorgeous, music is fantastic, story is complex and compelling, the characters diverse and engaging.  Everyone I know liked this movie a lot.  Two love stories, plenty of tragedy and twists.  Great actors and acting.  The story is revealed slowly through flashbacks, it's a great dramatic device and works very well.  I am a voracious reader and I have read the book as well:  I prefer the movie (I can only say this about one other novel/movie:  Dr. Zhivago).  Like I said, everyone I know liked it very much.  Enjoy.ovel/movie:  Dr. Zhivago).   Like I said, everyone I know liked it very much.  Enjoy.
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />One word says is all: MAINSTREAM. This renewed used formula has no artistic value whatsoever. How To Dismantle... is just something we've been hearing since 2000. More of the same cocktail. This is just a crass and embarrassing ATYCLB re-issue.  <br /> <br />For worse, most of the album is filled with typical U2 softer moments in 'Miracle Drug', 'Sometimes You Can't...', 'A Man And A Woman', 'Crumbs For Your Table', 'One Step Closer', 'Original Of The Species' and 'Yahweh'... wait a minute ? did you notice it ?... the whole B-side is just filler !!. is that \\"The best since Achtung Baby, or whatever\\" ? By no means. Both Zooropa and Pop are so much stronger than this weak and safe effort. WE ARE SICK OF ATYCLB STYLE !!.  <br /> <br />It's so familiar, so predictable, so boring and so commercial !!. The production is often over the top with Edge's trademarked guitars, keyboards or string sections plonked onto the barest of song structures. Obvious song structures. Bono sounds as awful as he could, screaming from five hundred yards away at a trash can, trying to show he still has a rich range. The whole album is just too obvious, too lacking in subtly and so commercial in intent it just hurts. Songs are nothing new, ripped off and arent refreshing. <br /> <br />U2 are purely for the satisfaction of people who do not dare venture into real true music. Its a sad state of affairs when someone as talentless as they are can get where they've got. They holds no musical value at all, its just cheap, commercial crap.
0316172324|3.0|There are a number of writers and reporters out there who never fail to impress me with their skill in gathering and presenting information and at the same time never fail to stun me with foolish conclusions. Malcom Gladwell, whose writing graces the pages of the New Yorker, is one such writer. He is such an excellent reporter and writes such beautiful prose that his readers seem to swallow even his most dubious and unjustified conclusions.<br /><br />Perhaps it's simply a consequence of his narrow education, but Gladwell manages to present the grossly obvious as if it were a brilliant insight while at the same time making inferences that are just this side of nonsensical. In this he reminds me of William Greider, whose \\"Secrets of the Temple\\", although the best history and description of the US Federal Reserve system ever written, in full of nonsensical conclusions, i.e., that inflation helps fuel economic recoveries. Tell that to Jimmy Carter.<br /><br />Gladwell's earlier book, \\"The Tipping Point\\", postulated that various phenomena take off once a critical point has been reached. Now put that way, it sounds profoundly obvious, and it is. Ice freezes at a critical temperature. Water boils at 100C. And so on. But Gladwell also accepts, at face value, a number of sociological theories that are without theoretical base, or even data, other than some casual observations. He doesn't, for example, touch on graph theory, which &lt;em>does&lt;/em> have some bearing on the spread of phenomena.<br /><br />In this book, his insight is that sometimes snap judgements are better than well-thought out ones. Again I'm reminded of Samuael Johnson's comment to a writer that \\"Your manuscript is both good and original. But the part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not good.\\" There is a good deal of recent research that looks at the processing between pereception and cognitive awareness, but when Gladwell touches on this he gets both his anatomy and his function wrong. Much of his discussion- like the fact that voters often choose attractive political candidates regardless of their qualifications- has more  to do with factors other than the immediate perceptions he's trying to make a case for.<br /><br />I still often enjoy reading Gladwell in the New Yorker- his recent piece on drug prices was a fine bit of reporting, even if his conclusions were not of the same caliber. But his books don't  seem to be in the same category.unction wrong.

Along with the regular music videos, there are also few live performances. You are definitely getting your money's worth with this purchase. If you grew up in the 80's, then you must add this dvd to your collection. It's just perfect. Good old fashioned artistic videos, with clean positive themes. And without a bunch of huchy mamas giggling around, like what there is nowadays in current music videos.

0393035158|5.0|The End of Faith is one great book very much needed in our times when the ignorance and cruelty of religion are the basis of so much evil continuing to be played out around the world, including George W. Bush's war in Iraq and the hinted claims of more of the same in Iran.  One religion or another, they all fight each other with the claim their book, or their interpretation of their book, is the only true one.  That thinking, as too, too often throughout history, bleeds into politics and government.  That is the very reason why James Madison led the other Founders in building a strict wall of separation between church and state into our Constitution.  That wall has been breached again by this administration.  Harris, in his solid observations and his mastery of English--to say nothing of his powerful and appropriate humor--helps to see the need to become informed about religious faith, to match it with all growing knowledge about our world, and to keep religion in its place, if not allow it to die a decent death.  A first step in that direction is to quit paying attention to politicians who so readily make themselves whores of religion. <br /> <br />Gil Cantlin

1401200605|5.0|Reading Hush from Beginning to End, I am deeply impressed. It borrows heavily from Frank Miller, even situations and dialogues are often so similar that one familiar with both can light up and go \\"A-HA!\\". This is in no way a bad thing. It makes Hush better because it borrows elements from the best Dark Knight comic ever(Dark Knight Returns), but it gives him a less rebellious and brutal attitude, and it showcases Batman from his best side.  <br /> <br />The writing is sharp, although not as brilliant as Miller`s, and the drawing is masterfully done. Each page is a stunning piece of art, and while the proportions are a bit overdone, one have to admit that Batman and Catwoman have never looked so good before. Her feline grace and sensuality is present in her every move, and Batman`s experience, strength and skills are shown in every frame.  <br /> <br />The story is one of the best I`ve read ever since DKR, The Killing Joke and Year One. I will not spoil the story, because it keeps you guessing and gasping at the surprises each chapter holds. This is really great stuff, and no wonder why it sold so well. True, its no Miller, but then again, what is? <br /> <br />Recommended to every fan of Batman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />***A Slight spoiler*** <br /> <br />Maybe in a nod to Miller, one of the later chapters of Hush pits the Dark Knight against the Man of Steel. Notice what Batman thinks to himself just as he understands who just arrived, and compare it to an almost identical situation in DKR. I say no more, but it was awesome and showed the respect these guys show for the master. <br /> <br />***Spoiler End*** <br />

B0006N2EZ0|4.0|But this IS NOT a 2 disc set.  I enjoyed this movie so much, but always wanted to see it in widescreen.  Now, after many, many years Warner has graced us with one.  Kevin Costner is the bodyguard, a role I would like to see him do again.  There is a good sequel in there somewhere, but we don't really need Whitney.  She's OK, well, she's playing herself really.  The musical numbers are great, the soundtrack is superb!  (Even that over, over, overplayed song \\"I'll Always Love You.\\"  I had the first edition on DVD, and this new one has better sound and higher picture quality.  If you watch this film often, treat yourself and upgrade to this special edition.  Also features a new documentary on the making of the film.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Big Fish is a wonderful film that quietly makes a great point-- sometimes you just must accept your loved ones the way they are and not the way you wish them to be. Amazingly once you allow yourself to accept them warts and all, they become all the more human.  <br /> <br />This film is wonderfully done, and Tim Burton (as director) is at his most restrained and sure handed. The fantasy scenes are beautifully filmed, with a slight surreal quality that makes them all the more dreamlike. Yet Burton manages never hitting you over the head with the fantasy element and keeps the story grounded in life, even when soaring in imagination.  <br /> <br />Burton urges effective and wonderful performances out of all of his actors. Ewan McGregor is wonderful as the optimistic, cocksure, and innocently trusting young Edward Bloom. His earnest believe in himself and his causes never rings false. The large cast of characters he meets in his journeys remind us of character traits we've seen in all our lives. Each contributes something to the person of Edward Bloom. <br /> <br />Yet as wonderful as these sequences are,  for me the movie is stolen by the pairing of Albert Finney and Jessica Lange as the older modern day Blooms, facing a difficult illness. Their relationship and love resonates very true and offers a clarity that their \\"troubled\\" son, who has lost patience with his father's tales,  simply cannot grasp. The pleasure of the film is watching him slowly come to understand his father's true legacy, as we see the real impact of his youthful tales come to fruition.  <br /> <br />Though not aimed at children, nor appropriate for the youngest, this film does stand as a fine story about the conflict of father and son, the depth of true love, and the search for what is truly a man's legacy. In the end, Big Fish leaves you with a smile and the satisfaction of knowing that the time watching this film was indeed time well spent.
B00002E224|5.0|The Before Sunrise/Sunset movies offer the very definition of romance.  Short-lived meetings and life-long memories.  Most of all they allow the viewer to determine the outcome.  These two separate meetings have had more influence on the lives of Jesse and Celine than any other event in their lives, with the possible exception of the death of Celine's grandmother.  Had Celine's grandmother not died the two may have been reunited and attempted to live out their one romantic night into a lifetime affair.         The question is will these two survive if they have the chance to let their love grow, or will their passion burn out and extinguish all that they remember from that night in Vienna, and that evening in Paris.  While Sunset is far less concerned with passion and more devoted to the idea of memory it is perhaps the more moving of the two films.  After Sunrise you could easily blow off the night they had as two people that didn't really know each other connecting on some level because the possibility of meeting again was so slim.  Sunset has them meet again, without the passion, or the sexual drive, but with the pshyes of two adults trying to understand why they can't get over that one night when they were essentially still kids.       As they meet again, and talk again, they fit neatly with one another, even though talk is a bit uncomfortable at first, and the weight of the situation bears down on them.  They realize that they are two people that will never be satisfied elsewhere if they haven't given each other a try in a realistic setting.         The song that Celine sings to Jesse is beautiful, romantic and heartbreaking, and the actors are impeccable both in the acting and the writing of their parts, and the result is the perfect follow up the defining film on young passionate love.  Here's to hoping that Jesse and Celine get together and stay together forever, and let us watch the whole of the way.
B0002VK66U|5.0|Yeah - another item I can cross off my \\"great album not on CD\\" list!  I got this shortly after it was released on vinyl many years ago, and I'm glad to see it out on disc. <br /> <br />Since you're reading this particular review, you're certainly familiar with the two Rainbow hits \\"Stone Cold\\" and \\"Street Of Dreams\\".  You also know that Joe Lynn Turner was the lead vocalist on those two songs.  This CD has a very similar sound compared to those tunes.  I never was a big enough Rainbow fan to buy any of their albums, so I can't compare this to any other Rainbow, nor can I compare it to any other JLT efforts.  But I can tell you that this CD is a great representation of the great 80's melodic hard rock genre.  It has great vocals, stabbing keyboards, crunchy guitar riffs, and a solid rhythm section.  All ten songs are mid- to up-tempo tunes - the closest thing to a ballad would be \\"Endlessly\\", and it moves at a decent tempo.  \\"Endlessly\\" did get played some on MTV when this album was originally released.  There's nothing on here I would classify as overly hard rock or heavy metal, just good solid melodic hard rock.  No over-the-top guitar heroics either, but good tasty solos.  Good songwriting, no silly lyrics. <br /> <br />If you like the following, I definitely recommend this CD: Rainbow (at least the two songs mentioned above), Foreigner, Night Ranger, Bon Jovi, Survivor, Sammy Hagar, Eddie Money, Michael Bolton (his first three albums), (and here's some more obscure stuff) Spys, John Parr, Van Stephenson, Van Zant. <br />
0688145078|5.0|We got this book for my two year-old son several months before his baby sister was born. We read it to him often enough that he had it memorized. Recently we told him a friend of his was also going to have a baby sister and asked if he had any advice to give. He thought a moment, being a three-month veteran at the big brother role at the time, and said \\"Someone needs to get him the Big Brother book. It helped me a lot.\\"  <br /> <br />I don't think I could have said it better myself.
B00008DDXC|5.0|HP & the COS is an instant Classic Fantasy Movie!! <br /> <br />this is great entertainment!!
B00002E23E|5.0|Nice stuff.  I would have given 4 satrs becouse the new Led Zep DVD has much more footage and doesnt break away from the satge as much.  I just can't rate Zep anything less then the highest allowed.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|To say that Shania Twain invented pop-rock crossover, or even to say that she is most responsible for popularising the trend, is probably an exaggeration.  Garth Brooks, Steve Earle, and the Judds might have something to say about that!  But to say that she has perfected the cross-over genre is not an exaggeration.  Shania, she of humble roots in a small Ontario town, of (quite frankly) mundane lyrics, and simple tunes, has become the best selling new country artist of all time, and her tunes, the tunes on this self-same Greatest Hits album, are often topping the pop charts as well. <br /> <br />An album like this is a no-brainer.  Her songs are radio-friendly.  She does not record albums so much as groups of songs.  Therefore, this album is not jarring to the ear - it's one toe-tapping tune after another.  Having said that, people familiar with Twain's music will know there are usually several versions of each song (at one point, Up! was supposed to be a triple album with 3 versions of each song).  This album only has one version of each song (except \\"Party for Two,\\" which has two versions with different partners singing the male part).  The version that appears is generally the \\"country\\" version.  This is good - her tunes are the best when you can hear the sincerity of her voice without a lot of overdubbed dance effects.  Tunes like \\"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\\" and \\"Up!\\" have been released in over-produced forms that are not nearly as enjoyable as the versions that appear here. <br /> <br />There is probably not a lot here for hard-core Shania fans.  For the casual fan that always wanted copies of these songs after having heard them on the radio, this is a good compilation to pick up.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|The Arcade Fire is a band that is unlike any other I've been exposed to [and that's countless bands...].  Their songwriting is un-paralleled.  The flow and transition is alluring, their use of instruments in creative, and they just know how to write songs that are beautiful as well as energizing.  How they do it?  I don't know.  All I can say is that once you see them perform live [which I have twice] you will want to be their faithful followers for the remainder of your life.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|This outstanding film has three current existing versions:  <br /> <br />1. The United States Theatrical Version (2 hrs. 25 mins) <br />2. The European Theatrical Version (Also known as the re-released Director's Cut) (3 hrs. 31 mins) <br />3. The Original Uncut German Television Version (4 hrs. 53 mins)  <br /> <br />I have seen and own all 3 versions of Das Boot, I have the United States version on two tapes, one in German with English subtitles and the other dubbed in English. I also have the Director's Cut and the Orginial Uncut Version on DVD.  <br /> <br />The United States Theatrical Version is the worst version to watch, yet still very good and still worth watching. The Director's Cut is more worth watching than the USA Theatrical Version, but not as worth it than the Uncut Version. The Uncut Version is definitely the best version to watch, but it's oppressive length will piss off some viewers. This version is more than twice as long as the USA Version (!) So that means, more than half of the existing footage of Das Boot was removed for the USA Version! So, Das Boot gets 3 1/2 stars for the theatrical version, 4 for the Director's Cut and 4 1/2 for the Uncut Version.
B0000028RR|5.0|It's been many years since \\"Rage Against the Machine\\" has come out with anything new. Since their split up in 2001, hard rock has taken a dramatic turn downward because one of the new warriors of rock moved on. The debut album of Rage, back in 1992, showed the world a new, powerful band in hard rock, and the album is firmly placed in the top 15 best hard rock albums of all time, up there with bands like Led Zepplin, Aerosmith, Jimi Hendrix, and Nirvana. <br /> <br />From the beginning, you sense the no-holds barred attitude of the band, particularily in the vocals of Zach de la Roach. The band stands up for what they believe in, and they don't take crap from anyone or anything. They sing what they believe in, and they do it with hard pounding, fierce rock. This isn't the Foo Fighters or System of a Down my friend, this is sung with vigor and heart. You'll find yourself jumping up and down, rocking out to tunes like \\"Killing in the Name Of\\".  <br /> <br />In the early 90's, rock looked to be in good hands once again with bands such as Nirvana, Metallica, and Rage Against the Machine taking over the airwaves. However, bad luck went down with Cobin's suicide, Metallica never quite getting to the place they once had in rock music, and Rage breaking up. Today, with the lack of good hard rock available, pulling this CD out and playing it can help you remember just how promising the new generation of rock once was. De la Roach is now working on a solo album, and the other boys have formed \\"Audioslave\\" with the former lead singer of \\"Soundgarden\\". Still, they will never get to the position and the potential they showed with their \\"Rage\\" debut. They won't even be close.
B000006045|5.0|What can I say.  This album blows my mind.  It glides along so damn smoothly with a menacing sound that mixes hip-hop, electronica, punk, R & B and just about everything other cool style under the sun, yet somehow works.  This is great electronic music for people who don't necessarily like electronic music.  This is by far their best and most alternative CD.
B000005RYQ|5.0|If you are looking for a way to get all the hits from The Police and nothing more, this is by far your best option. \\"The Classics\\" misses some songs and remakes others. This collection has the hits in their original untainted forms. That means the original \\"Roxanne\\", \\"Every Breath You Take\\", \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\", \\"King of Pain\\", and many more. This is your best bet to hear The Police when they were on top of the world.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|The Wachowski brothers didn't write a movie in the series, But I thought that movie was Revolutions. Low and behold it was the original. The evidence is unmistakable. 2 and 3 don't even sound like the original. <br />   <br />This movie tries so hard to be highly intelligent that it obliterates itself and the whole mythology of the original, with all of this overuse of philosophy, and special effects and nonsense. Take the subway station scene for example, How did he seperate his mind from his body. The Wachowski brothers have ideas how it is possible but they don't have a clear answer, and beside the story their direction needs serious help. Although after this movie I doubt anyone will be flocking to see a Wachowski Brother film. So they should probally spend their future doing something else.   <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />What has happened to this band? A years ago ( until 90's ) they were doubtlessly the best contemporary rock band and then suddenly they've became a sellout corporation. Bono's voice is  getting worse all the time, as well songwriting. Songs are miserable and lame, monotonous and annoying. Sterile production makes this album even worse. That production is very one-sided, with every song designed as a simple, catchy, mid-tempo rocker or ballad. Rotten simplistic crap as ATYCLB. As marketable as that previous soup. <br /> <br />This is essentially only a dull plodder, forgettable filler. A sea of mediocrity. Here we have U2 making a bunch of songs sound like trademarked U2. Plus, the vocal assault doesn't help take away the impression of U2 becoming dumbed down cartoon caricatures of themselves. <br /> <br />Achtung Baby and Pop now seemed a million miles away
0385510438|5.0|I really enjoy John Grisham books. It seems that whenever I get into a rut reading all I have to do is go back to reading something he wrote. This is only the third one I read (I've also read the Client and Runaway Jury and loved both of them) but I do plan on reading several others.  <br /> <br />This book had everything you could want from a book. It was easy to read, it had colorful characters, a very detailed story that moved at an appropriate pace, and a thrilling suspense factor where you had to keep reading to see what was going to happen. It also had a truely appropriate ending that summarized everything perfectly. I could not put this book down.  <br /> <br />I also enjoy historical fiction books and while this wasn't historical fiction in the traditional sense I enjoy reading good fiction books where you also learn something as well. Learning about how a small town dealt with all the issues of the early 70s like segretation etc was very interesting to me.  <br /> <br />This book does get a little gory at the beginning when it describes the rape and murder of one of the characters but it's necessary to evoke the passion needed to truly feel for the characters involved.  <br /> <br />Another brilliant book by John Grisham.
0385510454|1.0|This work by Grisham, who has written some excellent popular fiction in the past, especially in the law novel genre, is simply comparatively horrid. The plot is implausible, predictable, and, worst of all, boring.  The characters are shallow.  The resolution is disappointing and incomplete.  The only aspect of the book which is entertaining at all is a meager offering of the sense of style of the residents of Bologna, Italy.  To waste any more words on this review is unnecessary.  Find something else to read.
B0006399FS|1.0|I know the phrase gets thrown around a lot on these Amazon reviews, but this truely is one of the worst album's I have ever heard.  I mean seriously, to the point where it is almost unlistenable.  Bono apparently still thinks he is a good singer, so he drones on, song after song, belting out raspy, irritating vocals and lyrics that mean nothing.  Every song is uninspired drivel.  The album is total garbage, but will still be a huge hit anyway because the devoted fans will eat up anything the band puts out.  U2 is like Metallica - they were great in the 80's, OK in the '90's, but are now just corporate greedy sellouts riding off their former glory.  For the love of God, stop buying this, and maybe U2 will get a hint and stop making music.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|all the reviewers who think this is the worst movie they've ever seen are right. this is the worst movie I ever saw. I saw it free and still want my money back!  nothing funny. nothing redeeming. if anyone thought this movie was good simply has a screw loose.  Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was better than this.     ...an update after about a year.   although I never saw this movie ever again it seems to have a cult following. no, it doesnt even come close to the unforgettable Fast Times at Ridgemont High but i find several lines like \\"Idiot\\", \\"Gosh\\", and \\"My lips hurt real bad\\" being used around the house. The funniest thing about this movie is when John Heder hosted Saturday Night Live and told the story of the inspiration for Napolean coming from several people but not his good friend from college \\"Leopold Samsonite\\", nor is sidekick \\"Jose\\".  I would still fall asleep during this movie if it played again, but there are a few lines that seem to stick with you for a while.
B00005AAFS|5.0|This album is definitely worth getting. I got Reise Reise before this, and I'll say that while I don't find all of the songs as listenable as they are in Reise, Reise, the good songs in this album are simply some of their best work ever. <br />This album starts out kind of slowly, with the nicely written strings part with the cello (I think) having the melody. That is followed by a great vocal part, which develops into a great song, Mein Herz Brennt, as revealed by Till's screaming with the orchestral theme. The next song, Links2 3 4, is completely different. It opens with the sound of marching followed by the awesome guitar riff and a great marching beat. Beware of the urge to goose-step. This is followed by the slightly weaker song Sonne. While the chorus to this song is brilliant, the rest of the song lacks inspiration. This is followed by Ich Will, which has a very nice chorus which is a dialogue between Till and a crowd. Very brilliant way to get audience interaction. The keyboard part is pretty good too, as is the soprano. This is followed by a soft keyboard introduction, when suddenly the drums crash and a guitar powerchord comes in while the other guitar starts playing the thrilling, fast riff. This is a real punch in the face, in a good way. While Feuer Frei lacks musicality, it's thrilling enough that you don't notice. This is a song to get you on edge. Afterwards we have quite a contrast: the soft, acoustic introduction with the sound of a baby in Mutter. This song has a great riff and some good orchestral writing, however I tired of it quickly. This is followed by the spoken vocal introduction to Spieluhr, which sounds like someone telling children a story. The keyboard then comes in with a great keyboard part, after which the song gets going. Great song overall. This slow song is then followed by the fast riff of Zwitter, which is a great, playful song with some hilarious lyrics. The chorus is brilliant and extremely catchy. This is followed by Rein Raus, which when introduced sounds way too similar to Links 2 3 4. I never really connected with this song, so I don't like it that much. Afterwards is the acoustic intro to Adios, which is followed by a great riff and some great vocals. The guitar solo is great, as is the chorus and the \\"los, los, los bop bop shu bop\\" effect when they use alternate speakers. It doesn't sound very rammstein, it's a little more... well... urban sounding, but it's still a great song. THis album has a rather disappointing closer. I don't really like nebel at all. The lyrics are nice, but the music is just boring.
B0000027RL|5.0|One of the most important rock bands of the \\"grunge\\" era is without a doubt, Pearl Jam, and this album sets the band up for the immediate success that wyould follow after they released this awe-inspiring, and impressive album. Starting off with the track Once, we are taken into Eddie Vedder's world which is colliding so quickly, that the insanity that insues from every portion of the music redirects your senses and makes you completely reinterpret what you could expect from music in the early 90's. Pearl Jam completely redefined rock music with this album, much like Nirvana did with Nevermind, and Alice in Chains did with Dirt, all of these albums helped to define each band with their own unique sound, which they would build upon for years to come, although Pearl Jam began getting a little different after Vitalogy and some fans did not enjoy the way that the songs became slower paced and more relaxed, (I enjoy almost all of Pearl Jam's albums, with the exception of Riot Act which has not really had a chance to grow on me yet). Once is actuall the second part of a trilogy of songs pertaining to Eddie Vedder finding out that the man he believed to be his father, was in fact not his real father, which is portrayed in the song Alive, which is included on this album as well. After finding this out in Alive, Vedder takes his persona through the phase of going literally insane in Once, and the final song in this trilogy is a b-side off of Ten called Footsteps, which is basically this insane persona reflecting on wht he has done because of the information that has been revealed to him. Theer are so many standout tracks on this album that to go into dtail of each one would take forever but, I will go in depth about a few. Black and Oceans to me are two of the greatest tracks on this whole album, from an artistic and emotional standpoint, as Black is about a love that is lost and echoes with the same sadness that is found in such Pearl Jam songs as Yellow Ledbetter (also a b-side from this album); black also contains one of the most heart felt lines of this ere when Vedder exclaims \\"I know some day you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star in somebdy elses sky, but why can't it be mine?!\\", damn I love Pearl Jam. Anyway though Oceans is great as it may help some people get through the emotional detachment that happens when you are dating or married to someone and they go away for while, and all you have to think of them is pictures, memories, and hopefully the occassional phone call. Listening to this song years ago when my now ex-girlfriens was away in another country made me want to just reach out across the oceans and hold onto her. Enough about me though, back to this album, which is truly a masterpiece, along with Vs which is more of a condensed Pearl Jam album as it takes some of the sprawling guitar solos on this album and condenses them together blending into an awe-inspiring performance that finally ends with the amazing Indifference. Buy this album and you will not be dissappointed, take my word for it, an amazing album, from beginning to end, no placeholder songs, no skipping of songs, just an utterly amazing experience.
