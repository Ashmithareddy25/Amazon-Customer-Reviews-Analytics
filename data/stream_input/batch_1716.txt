B008I3QZKU|4.0|The Killers are attention hounds. Especially lead singer Brandon Flowers. From every over-emoted vocal, to all the Springsteenian attempts at epic teenaged dramas, and from guitarist Dave Keuning's stadium ready guitars, The Killers playtheir music to a bog coliseum. They even shot for an REO Speedwagon ballad on \\"Here With Me\\" (hey, the opening line \\"Wheels Are Turning\\" is the title to an REO album.) So if you're a bit put off by grandiose overreaching, \\"Battle Born\\" probably isn't an album for you.<br /><br />On the other hand, I consider \\"Sam's Town\\" to be an amazing album, and \\"Battle Born\\" is more in that vein than the art poppish \\"Day and Age.\\" And just like \\"Sam's Town,\\" the results are either gloriously grand (\\"Runaways\\") or a touch too much (\\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\"). That's only because The Killers refuse to let ambition hold them back, so amidst the big USA songs the heed from NJ via NV to the 80's synths in \\"Flesh and Bone\\" or \\"The Rising Tide,\\" \\"Battle Born\\" wears its Las Vegas heart on its snazzy sleeve. You'll find few better rock albums this year than \\"Battle Born.\\"
B004IK8Q86|1.0|2012-Nov-06<br /><br /> Why is the Kindle Version $12 and the paperback $11? THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! The Kindle version should be TWO bucks? maybe THREE bucks? NO manufacture cost, NO shipping cost, Maughm has been DEAD for 47 years... CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN THIS TO ME? WHERE DOTH THE GREED LIE? Publisher? Amazon?<br /><br />[BTW, I love this book. I think all high school students should read it!]<br /><br />Salamat.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Amazing series. I can see why the leads were awarded Emmys. Once I started watching, it turned into a marathon and I finished the entire first season in 2 days. Each show leaves you wanting more. I don't have cable so was very pleased to find Homeland on Amazon.<br />Looking forward to Season 2.
0385344333|1.0|A Wanted Man is really a Boring man!  I used to eagerly await each new Jack Reacher book and always pre-ordered them.  The previous book in the series was disappointing to me, so this time I got A Wanted Man from the library and I am so glad I didn't waste my  money on the book.<br />This book had to be the most rambling, boring book ever! Rambling as Reacher hitchhikes and rambling as he travels across Nebraska, Iowa etc. driving back & forth...just plain boring.<br />It didn't take much of a detective to figure out what was going on in the car, but the ending-the ending just fizzled out.  The whole book was a huge disappointment to me.<br />I think it is time Reacher was retired & Mr Childs finds some new material.
B00005JLH3|4.0|Wouldve been a true honest 5 star, but unfortunatly let down bye the zoneing of the dvd (my fault for not reading right). Yet again tho the rest of the positives are great reputable dealer fast delivery n very cheap. Will be seeing you guys again.

1573226521|4.0|Alex Garland's \\"The Beach\\" is a fun read that reminds me of Lord of the Flies.  Garland, who has gone on to create atrocities like Dredd 3D, is at his peak here.  A bunch of Gen-Xers, marijuana farmers, secret beaches, utopias gone wrong, etc. make this really entertaining.  Not classic literature, but worth the time anyway.  Much better than the movie.
B009JNXK88|2.0|I played it for a couple of levels and found the controls an exercise in frustration.  Might be OK if I had a real set of controls instead of on screen.<br /><br />Uninstalled.

1421550644|5.0|This impressive deluxe hardcover collection features the complete \\"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind\\" ('Kaze no Tani no Naushika') epic illustrated by internationally acclaimed film director and animator Hayao Miyazaki.<br /><br />It features a slipcase box with 2 mammoth-sized hardcover tomes that collects the entire run (vols. 1-7). The pages are impressive as the illustrations are presented in sepia-toned hues, presenting to readers the story as how it originally appeared when it first came out. There are a few colored pages, and an exclusive 2-sided fold-out full-color poster.<br /><br />The packaging of this collection is much similar to DC Comics' Absolute Edition books (e.g.,[[ASIN:1401212824 Absolute Batman: The Long Halloween]]). Kudos to Viz Media for publishing this magnificent collection in this deluxe format!<br /><br />For die-hard manga fans and for casual readers who enjoy good ol' classic adventure epics, this collection is highly recommended. Well worth the price!
B008KE3960|4.0|I am enjoying this game as it is a little different then the normal tower defense game in that you can move your planes around. I miss being able to upgrade them but I believe they automatically upgrade when you raise your level. so far I have been able to open new levels without spending real money - overall it's a nice change and I am enjoying playing it on my kindle.
B009LUAR0I|5.0|This is a great CD that definitely lifts me up.  Very hard to sit still while it's on.  Fresh sound with the use of digital effects, but his talent still shines through.  \\"Lola\\" is a true gem.  \\"Underwater\\" and \\"Emily\\" are also favorites.
B009JNXK88|4.0|downloaded and plays well on my kindle - it definately reminds me of old nes games. I have trouble with the controls as it's hard for me to hold the kindle and play - some of the levels took too long for me to navigate and it got very frustrating. overall not a bad game but too high in frustration for me to deal with in my limited time. on the plus side the levels are fairly quick so it can be played when time is limited.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|I just bawled my eyes out watching Episode 4 of Season 3. This series is absolutely phenomenal and is so different than other shows because you don't ever see what's coming next.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|This book kept my attention because I wanted to see how the characters could get on without the need for the \\"Play room\\"<br />It was a page turner but was let down slightly by the ending... I don't know how I would have changed it but something was missing, it just ended, I wasn't left wanting more from these characters.<br />All in all it was a great trilogy, not for the faint hearted!

1423140605|5.0|I'm a major Percy Jackson's fan. I've read every single book - and I must say, I lovedd it. Rick Riordan introduced me to Greek Mythology and made me addicted to it. He has a wonderful way of telling his stories and I read all his books in one seating. This one was no exception. It is amazing!<br />I liked very much the different POVs. The mythology and the fights are very well done as well.<br />So overall, I found this the best percy Jackson book and I'm already re-reading it. So I need to shout to the world: read it!<br />If I could, I'd rate it 10 stars.<br />Great job as always, Riordan!
B0059XTV4Y|1.0|Wallis Warfield Simpson was one of the most controversial figures of the 20th century -- a twice-divorced American whose love affair with King Edward VIII led to his abdication.<br /><br />So you would THINK that even Madonna could wring a decent dramatic movie out of the woman. Some passion, some intensity, some controversy... SOMETHING. But \\"W.E.\\" ends up being a choppy, jumbled affair that leaves you desperately hoping for something other than total fluff. And you never, ever get it.<br /><br />It's not actually the story of Wallis herself, but of Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish), the wife of a wealthy doctor in present-day New York. Wally's husband neglects her (he's obviously having an affair) and doesn't want to have a baby with her, so she wanders to Sotheby's to ogle the for-sale possessions of the legendary Duchess of Windsor.<br /><br />She also falls in love with an attentive Russian guard after a savage beatdown by her husband. For some reason, she also starts... hallucinating? Seeing visions? Communing with the ghost of Wallis?<br /><br />Well, whatever happened, she starts seeing Wallis' (Andrea Riseborough) past -- her introduction to the Prince of Wales (James D'Arcy), the affair that sprang up, the glamorous life they had together, and his obsessive love for her that led him to abdicate, even though Wallis was desperate for him not to do so.<br /><br />Anyone expecting a semi-balanced depiction of Wallis and Edward should keep looking, because  \\"W.E.\\" is basically a cinematic fanfic written by a starry-eyed Wallis fangirl. Wallis and Edward are shiny, perfect, idealized dolls who are everything noble and glamorous, and anyone who dislikes them is just a mean ol' hater who irrationally loathes poor wittle Wallis.<br /><br />In fact, Madonna is so wedded to this depiction that she either ignores (Wallis' other affairs, her botched abortion) or dismisses (Nazi sympathies) every imperfection that either of them had. She tries to justify it with a cache of fictional \\"secret\\" letters, but it all rings hollow.<br /><br />Sadly, the rest of the movie is all flashy, glamorous prettiness with no substance. Madonna's direction is a constant assault of choppy, fragmented edits -- for instance, an intimate kiss between Wallis and Edward is interrupted by a random pan right up a palm tree. The most surreal? A drug-fueled scene where Wallis hikes up her dress and does a suggestive dance with another woman... IN FRONT OF A CROWD.<br /><br />And on the rare occasions when Madonna DOES try to give us a deep emotional moment, it comes across as artificial and clumsy (\\"People seem to only focus on what he gave up for her. But what about what she gave up?\\"). It's like a teenage \\"Twilight\\" fan directed this.<br /><br />As the final indignity, Wallis' complex story is just window-dressing for the story of Wally. Madonna tries to ram the \\"similarities\\" down our throat (Wally's rotten husband is referred to as \\"our own Prince of Wales\\"), but in the end there is almost nothing in common between these two women. So, they're alike because their marriages didn't work? That's all? Who CARES about Wally?<br /><br />The actors... well, they do the best they can. Cornish is stiff and awkward, but Riseborough and D'Arcy do the best they can with their flimsily perfect characters. Unfortunately, the awful direction makes their dramatic scenes look ridiculous -- when Wallis runs into her bedroom to cry, Madonna manages to make the act of RUNNING look artificial.<br /><br />\\"W.E.\\" was booed at Cannes, and rightfully so -- it's a clumsy, hackneyed story that shows that Madonna is as bad a director as she is an actress. Stick with \\"Edward & Mrs. Simpson\\" for a more skilled, nuanced depiction.fictional \\"secret\\" letters, but it all rings hollow.<br /><br />Sadly, the rest of the movie is all flashy, glamorous prettiness with no substance.

0143121316|4.0|Henry Kissinger has incredibly unique insight into China's 20th Century history, and the chapters that touch on his personal experience are outstanding. As with any memoir, those sections should be taken with a grain of salt--but that hardly diminishes their impact. These chapters alone make the book a must read.<br /><br />The earlier sections on Tang dynasty history, The Art of War and Weiqi, are all similarly interesting, but somewhat more perplexing. At some point did Henry Kissinger really become an expert on 8th Century Chinese history? Probably not, but he nonetheless has drawn on a group of researchers that clearly do have excellent knowledge of these periods. If the book is somewhat long and overly lionizes the brilliance of the Chinese political mind (It's a little much to hear how Mao repeatedly bested the Soviets, Americans, Koreans, Vietnamese etc, while somehow not managing to secure any major concessions, like Taiwan, for example), it still provides excellent insight and covers a huge swath of Chinese history with excellent detail.<br /><br />Regardless of Kissinger's odd crush on China and apparent help writing the book, it's nonetheless worth a read.
B0092C2X7U|1.0|Just by looking at images and the name of the game,  it looks pretty stuiped. Seeing all the bad reviews this game must be stuiped.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is really fun.  I can't stop playing it. I think that you should buy it. it is really hard to stop, because if you don't get it you want to do it again. buy it its free.

B007THA4FI|4.0|Choppy throughout and hasty toward the end, Ms. Rowling's new novel nevertheless demonstrates the  extraordinary powers of characterization that were so apparent in her Harry Potter stories. The scenes she creates are mostly nothing special, nor is the language she uses to shape them particularly compelling. But the people who inhabit those scenes haunt the mind.  In presenting us with &#34;A Casual Vacancy,&#34; JK Rowling exercises a remarkable gift, but it is a little hard to define its terms.  The real work here is not that of a writer, nor even of a storyteller -- it's rather as if she were the author of an invisible play, with the object being our cathartic experience of fear and pity, and the mechanism being the interstitial grip that the heart of the imagined has on the heart of the real.
B001AQT0RC|4.0|I purchased this movie as a birthday present for my husband. We both enjoyed the movie however I felt it was a little too drawn out in sections and not enough detail in the actual 'contact' section. Overall it is a good movie and worth the time to watch it.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This is a great show and season.  I'm not one to re-watch what I have already seen but I made an exception b/c I liked it so well when it was originally airing.  The writers do a fabulous job of creating hilarious comedy and the actors deliver with excellent timing.  They are all so kooky but charming.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This was the best SuperHero movie ever. I should know I am a 60 year old grandma so I have seen plenty. I loved the Hulk's dry wit. I even enjoyed Ironman more in this movie than I did in his own features.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|The book is great but there are lots of problems I'm finding with the Kindle version. I may be forced in to purchasing a hard copy! This is the first time I've had major problems with a Kindle edition and I read a lot!
B005IQZB14|5.0|A fascinating story! If I didn't know it was true I would think someone had a remarkable imagination. I have a hard time going out to dinner by myself, hiking thousands of miles of desolate country alone is amazing.
B009FZZK8I|5.0|It is seldom that I really, really love a movie or a T.V. series.  The Walking Dead is a show that keeps me excited and focused.  It is well written and well presented.  Yes, it is very gory ( enough to say stop ).  But the story line sucks you in and the special effects makes one realize that this is a \\"KEEPER.\\"<br />WELL DONE!
B001KTATIS|5.0|Great Film, Great seller, great experience. It was a bit horrific so not for the feint hearted, but otherwise a great piece of history that reminds us that there was some pretty uncivilised behaviour back in Roman times!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|UPDATE 12/21/12: The developer pushed an update to this app yesterday, and fixed the issue with the Kindle Fire HD (detailed below in my original review). I finally got to use the app last night while I slept, and it was great. The UI is clean and intuitive, and the ability to create your own \\"blends\\" of sounds is wonderful. There's a very nice assortment of sounds included, so chances are you'll find something that works for you. It took a while to get the kinks ironed out, but I finally feel like I can get my money's worth now.<br /><br />----------<br />I purchased this app on the strength of the reviews, but now I find them a bit suspect. While the interface of the app is nice and it's easy to use, there are very short gaps or disruptions when some of the sounds loop. I noticed it on several, and they were unfortunately the sounds that I would be most likely to use to sleep. When those sounds loop, there's a brief pause in the sound -- a fraction of a second, while it repeats, but extremely noticeable and very distracting. I tried to ignore it, but my brain just started anticipating the gaps, making it impossible to fall asleep.<br /><br />If they could fix those sounds, I'd give the app 5 stars in a heartbeat. Until then, it's completely worthless to me. I sent a message to their support email. We shall see if they're responsive.<br /><br />Please note that I'm using this on a Kindle Fire HD (7\\"). The issue I'm describing may not exist on other devices. I did write to the developer's support email, and received a response saying that they were aware of the issue and working on a fix, which would be out in a week or two. That was a week ago, so we'll see. If they fix it, I'll be sure to update this review accordingly.<br /><br />UPDATE: On November 6, \\"Simon\\" from Ipnos Soft said that they were aware of the problem and should release an update in 1-2 weeks. It's now been well over a month and there has been no update. I'm lowering the rating to one star.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the first two immensely.  Had to read this because of the first two.  It wasn't hard to read, but I just felt that Ms Collins had pretty much worn out the environment of Panem.
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|This is a great buy for the price. The mix of material is very interesting. I am thoroughly enjoying this purchase. The performances are outstanding and the recordings are nice and clean.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|I have to admit I did like some of the visual effects of this movie, and, they did have a storyline closer to the one in the actual books, However, it was so predictable as to what is going to happen next it was sheer boring. Plus, they missed the whole boat with the whole romance thing. Anyway it was OK for the effects but I won't be watching this again.
031618201X|5.0|I've read the entire Parasol Protectorate series, and fell in love with all of the characters.  When I realized they were making it into a manga, I knew that I had to have it.  I've read Soulless in book form, listened to the audio book, and read the manga version.  The art is beautiful and the story abridged, but I love all the ways I get to enjoy this story!
B005XN31LY|5.0|I love this show!!!!!! I have had 3 or 4 friends watch it because it is so good!!!!! If you are thinking about watching it you should!!!! even my boyfriend liked it and I didnt think that he would!!!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I was looking for my next game PC to replace the Q6600 that I build in 2007.  Performance of this processor is about 3x more than the Q6600.  Pair it along with AsRock Extreme 4 and some SSDs, the system is sick (that's what my co-workers calls it).  Over clocking is fun and extremely easy with AsRock Extreme 4.<br /><br />The price per performance of this processor is unbeatable.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Loved this story! It was exactly what I needed to help unwind and forget about all the craziness going on around me. \\"Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes\\" was quick paced, light, cute, and entertaining. It had a little mystery and a little love. I loved Rose! She was quirky, funny, naive, loving, and had a back bone when needed. I can't wait to read book #2. I'm hoping for a little more Joe and Rose romance. My only complaint ... minor editing issues. I'm a stickler for editing.
B001N3UO68|4.0|This was a very exciting flick. Keeps you on the edge of your seat, but it wasn't realistic when the one Muslim said \\"this has nothing to do with Islam.\\" That was nothing but some dishonest, politically correct crap.

Allah (Himself) fighteth against them. How perverse are they!\\"<br /><br />Q4.24 \\"And all married women are forbidden unto you (for sex) save those (female captives) whom your right hands possess. It is a decree of Allah for you...\\"<br /><br />Sunan Abi Dawud, 2640 (Narrated Anas ibn Malik) \\"The Prophet (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said: I am commanded to fight with men till they testify that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is His servant and His Apostle, face our qiblah (direction of prayer), eat what we slaughter, and pray like us. When they do that, their life and property are unlawful for us except what is due to them. They will have the same rights as the Muslims have, and have the same responsibilities as the Muslims have.\\"<br /><br />Q9.lll \\"Lo! Allah hath bought from the believers their lives and their wealth because the Garden will be theirs: they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be slain.

B009FBX5M0|2.0|That a great filmmaker like Sam Mendes directed Skyfall meant having to accept his team. Including Thomas Newman. While the American composer might be appropriate for dramas such as American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, an action film, especially a James Bond one, was something totally foreign to his style and capabilities. Even in Road to Perdition his music don´t reached a great level to serve for preparation for a commission of this magnitude. Least when David Arnold had defined \\"bondian\\" music of the past decade (though heavily influenced by John Barry, which is appreciated).<br />Newman, on the other hand, delivers only a series of repetitive and very similar tracks. Only those with interpolations of the James Bond Theme, by Norman, allow reminding us that we are listening the soundtrack of a movie of our favorite secret agent. In conclusion, a missed opportunity that could have made a difference or have meant a contribution to the long saga of 007. Except some scattered sparks (The Bloody Shot, Brave New World, Breadcrumbs), this score is dull, bland, and very little original. Over time, it will be one of the low points in the musical history of James Bond.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Especially those living in GMO-central: USA.  I have now cut wheat from my diet and I am leaner and feel better than perhaps I ever have.  My mother also read the book, cut wheat and increased protein and veggies and she's lost 4 pounds in 3 days, plus she's less hungry and more satisfied with what she's eating!  This book is truly life-changing and doctors need to read it as well.

0307474259|5.0|I have struggled with my weight for years. I've tried nearly everything but I've always gained the weight back.<br /><br />I felt this book was the first one that really explained what is happening in a way I could grasp. It is a terrific book, easy to understand and gives you what you need to know to change things.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I had to stop playing these machines when I was a kid. They gave out real money back then and sometimes still do in Europe. This lets me play without zipping through cash. The prizes and puzzles are annoying, and I wish the background would change with the levels, but the playing has me hooked. Just take off your pants, pop some corn, put on your cowboy boots and push some coins!
B008NR91DO|5.0|Gary Moore, the Irish Master guitarist playing Hendrix its a treat in itself. Anything Moore plays is always welcomed and now truly missed. Moore's interpretations of Hendrix is top notch and the tone that Gary gets out of all those stratocasters  is enough to give you goosebumps. Gary plays with an attitude that does justice to these songs and Moore fans know that he can dish out with the best and its too bad that Gary never jammed with SRV because talk about playing Hendrix with an attitude, not too many guitarists can do it. Sure many play the songs note by note, sound by sound, but the attitude is missing. Not with Gary Moore, his vibrato is monstrous. Get the CD or the DVD. I prefer the DVD so I can see the finger action and the interaction with his band, specially when Billy Cox and Mitch Mitchell join them on stage.<br />A must have for Gary Moore fans, Oh, don't forget to crank it loud !
0316228532|3.0|I opened the book prepared to love it, and, in fact, The Casual Vacancy is well written, begins with an interesting delimma, and introduces several characters who ultimately wind together in interesting ways. Ms. Rowling describes people and their personal tics as well or better than anyone and I had no trouble picturing them in my mind.<br /><br />Despite all this, however, I had to read over half the book before I really cared about any of the characters. In fact, at the end of the book, the character I cared about most was the one who had died at the beginning of the book. I wanted to like them, but even though various characters' circumstances were difficult or should lead to sympathy, every live character except for one had so many unlikeable traits that it made them very difficult to relate or sympathize with.<br /><br />That said, I'm glad I read the book, and the writing was so good that it made me more forgiving of the lack of empathy the book elicited from me.
B003XQPYR2|5.0|Great adaptation maybe better than the E Flynn version would love to see a sequel but that doesn't seem to be in Mr Crowe's DNA
B0027MJU00|5.0|Flynn ups her game in Dark Places. I throughly enjoyed Sharp Oblects but this time Flynn hooks the reader with the very first line. From then on we are compelled to keep reading. The writing is so good I had to reread sections just to enjoy the rhythm of the words. This author adds significant tiny details masterfully, building the setting, the characters, and the tension sentence by sentence.<br /><br />The eventual description of the crime is graphic, which might turn off some readers, but it seems necessary as the characters involved each tell their version of the events. It's always satisfying to read a psychological thriller, who-dunnit, that is so well-crafted.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is my first foray into e-reading. I bought 1 book and the app. I enjoyed the experience, but I still prefer the paper books. E reading is definitely convenient, but how do you pass on a good book to someone else? How do you handle low battery issues? Sharing the tablet with your partner has some problems. I am still not convinced that e-reading is better than paper book reading, but I may try again. The app was really easy to use, but a readily available help manual would have definitely been nice.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game. This is a wonderful app to have .I love it.Good if u like challenges .
0385535147|1.0|This is it for me.  He has gone the way of James Patterson in my book buying. I thought the last few books were bad, but this one tops them all. I am such a devoted Grisham fan (read them all) that I actually thought it was my fault that I lost the plot, so I went back to try and pick it up.  I gave up and never finished it - the struggle was not worth it. Actually it does not even rate one star, but I had to give it one to write this review.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|this game rocks and is a great game for a challenge.<br />take it from me this game is so addictive I could barley stop playing to write this.
1451695195|5.0|A man with an experience will never be convinced by a man with a mere argument.  Thanks, Dr. Alexander, for sharing your \\"experience\\" with the world.  It would be difficult for a person in any occupation to share that experience.  I cannot imagine what you've had to endure, given your profession.  Thanks for your courage and your commitment.
B00007E8SW|5.0|This new release sounds like it was recorded yesterday, even though it is 50 years old. If you are a fan and have a halfway decent stereo, I would suggest checking this one out.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Interesting premise, but so much like Alien.  Can't believe the story line would want our \\"forebearers\\" to go back to earth to destroy it.
B0009A21R6|5.0|This is one of the best sounding discs in my collection. If you like these guys, Get this re-release into your collection.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|as usual i couldnt put it down... Baldacci does it again! can never get enough of the nonstop page turning
B00008CLOA|5.0|This release has opened up a new listening experience. I have worn out several LP's and a few discs of DSotM over the last 30 years so I can say I know this album. This recording has reopened my ears because of either new sounds included or just ones that were previously burried in the mix are more prevalent. Everthing sounds more alive and closer in the room than any previous releases I have heard.
0060558121|3.0|Review of author's preferred text version.<br />SPOILERS:<br />The gods, when no one(in the old world) believes in them anymore, move (with their few remaining believers, I think) to America (why, I don't know) for a long and miserable retirement.<br />This is an intriguing premise and there is a little moment of \\"oh wow\\" when you work it out.<br />Therafter... I don't know what, the plot doesn't seem to go anywhere (it may go somewhere after Chapter 6).  I could have been carried forward by wanting to know what happens to the characters, but I didn't like any of them enough to care.  The old gods are an unpleasant bunch.<br />I think it did win lots of awards - so hey what do I know :)
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This is an incredible remix of 10 years of Beatle music intertwined together with an incredible result. If you are a purist, you may not like what they did, but if you would like to hear a new twist on songs you know every millisecond by heart, you may enjoy this as much as I do. Songs have been disected track by track, part by part and reassembled into a Beatles collage. Truly amazing.
0553386794|5.0|Five stars.  BUY this book!<br />It's the story that started me reading fantasy again.  (And wishing I hadn't because little else measures up to this.)<br />Or don't, if you really like trad. 'high fantasy' because this isn't traditional high fantasy.<br />There are no really dark characters, there are multi-facted people.<br />There is little magic (and one weakness, I think it has, is that the magic isn't very convincing.)<br />Good people (SPOILER) can die.<br />But it does have great characters, interesting ideas and excellent plotting.<br />As has been written elsewhere its more like reading Roman history (with all the gory bits) than a fanstasy novel.<br /><br />Oh, and it's much better than the TV version, which I found too gloomy and dark to hold me (though I alos knew what was going to happen).<br />WORD OF WARNING: if you enjoy it you are in for a long read/ride: six books later we're not at the end yet.
B009K52HN4|4.0|Halloween H20 is a decent slasher flick, and the seventh in the Halloween series overall.  It's intended to be a direct sequel to \\"Halloween II.\\" It is an effective capstone to a makeshift trilogy of films focusing on Jamie Lee Curtis' character Laurie Strode.  Slasher fans might be annoyed that it ignores parts 4 - 6 of this series, but if they are willing to take the film on its own merits it still has a lot to offer.  The story pays loving tribute to the original film, casting and performances are well above average for the genre, and the emphasis is on suspense rather than gore.  The film has a few drawbacks, though - it is far too short, the musical score is borderline terrible, and The Shape's mask seems to change from shot to shot throughout the film.<br /><br />Amazon.com's HD presentation (viewed on Halloween 2012) is very good.  Unlike the blu-ray issued by Echo Bridge, the picture is presented at its proper aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and detail is much improved.  The image is still a little dark, and some specks of debris are visible on the print.  Overall, though, its a satisfying presentation.  I didn't have any problems with the audio - dialogue was clear and the soundtrack was not overbearing.  Hopefully, this HD presentation will become the basis for a new blu ray issue.
0061474355|5.0|Re-read this again recently and, whilst it doesn't stand up again so well on a second reading (or I'm older now) it reminded how much I loved this the first time around.<br />It has engaging characters (including non-human, magical ones) interesting magic and a very convincingly created world with lots of details - two worlds in fact, one on either side of the wall.<br />It's high point through must be (SPOILER) the depiction of the way into death, the way back from it and the strange workings of magic that surround all that.<br />For me this was a fabulous five star book, whereas the sequels were merely very good.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I think the reason some didn't enjoy this movie was simply the hype one makes for themselves, and that most believed they were about to see a rehash of Alien. In \\"some ways\\" it is, but Prometheus is its own movie simply set within the \\"Alien\\" universe. This isn't the story of the xenomorph aliens of old per-say, this is the story about the Engineers, aka the Space Jockey race (of course there's religious things as well but you'll get out of it what you'll get out of it). If the decide to make sequels its already been stated such sequels will step further away from Alien and be its own thing, which I think is good.<br /><br />This movie is visually stunning, breathtaking even. Top notch quality here. Ridley Scott shows off his abilities to make wondrous photography, something most who didn't like the movie but actually watched it might agree with. The sound is likewise as good, creating a vibrant surround sound atmosphere I think anybody with a home theater will appreciate. I can't comment on the 3D since I lack the glasses to view it on my ST50, but one day I will for certain. Extra's are plentiful with extended/deleted scenes, two commentaries, and a good sized documentaries.<br /><br />People had these questions about the film they felt weren't answered throughout the story. I urge someone to watch a bit closer next viewing: most answers are within the movie, some extended/deleted scenes help likewise. I'm not gonna run through a Q&A on them, but I have one popular spoiler that baffles me whenever I hear someone didn't understand why the event took place (see SPOILER below).<br /><br />In a nut shell, this is a great blu-ray and while not a Directors Cut with the extended scenes inserted back into the film, someone who loved the film will buy the Collectors Edition simply because its worth it.<br /><br />&lt;SPOILER: one common one is \\"why did David poison Halloway?\\" I thought that was answered in the film. He was commanded to \\"try harder\\" and took things the next step. No where in the movie does it state that androids have to follow the Asimov's Law. In a promotional vid, I know not in the movie but this is extra content to flesh out the universe and included in the BD, a commercial for David claims he will do things employee's would consider \\"unethical.\\">ep.

B009NPKTN6|1.0|bad movie, tom cruise was awesome though. the lead-female was not very good.  the British actor (katy p's X) dog crap.
B00845MRKE|5.0|I missed out on the prior release to Blade Runner on blu-ray. It was sold out or pulled before I could purchase it, but I am happy I didn't miss out again. I recently watched this classic science fiction piece of work, well the Final Cut version... so far. My impressions are mind blowing. Every version of the film I watched prior always looks grainy (might not be the best descriptive), dark (crushing so), and a movie that simply showed its age. Not so anymore. The Final Cut is a blazing transfer. As so many well done transfers do, it looks like a new movie with deep blacks and bright pops (where appropriate). Some scene have been enhanced but nothing to get bent out of shape over. This is, as Ridley himself states, the version of the film he likes best. I agree whole heartily. Surround sound is also excellent, and I believe a new mix (probably new from the older BD release).<br /><br />This is a MUST OWN in anybodies collection. Don't let this movie pass you by, unless you already own it on blu-ray.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Another great book, picks up very well from the first book. You get connected to Ana and Christian, a real page turner.  I can't wait to start reading book 3
0062060562|4.0|I really enjoyed this. I had the audio version and often listened to it on the commute to work. What I find fantastic is the carefully paced plotting. This must have required a great deal of thought and I take my hat off to the writer for managing to pull it off successfully. The layers of deceit are peeled away chapter by chapter and I found this riveting. For those reviewers complaining the story is unrealistic - give me a break! It's a thriller and thrillers are meant to push the boundaries of believability. Is Hitchcock's Psycho or Vertigo realistic? No. But they're terribly good - as is this novel.
B000JIHP88|3.0|This mobile is very cute and was easy to put together.  The motor isn't really that loud, but it drowns out the rainforest sounds which was a bummer since that is a big reason as to why I got it - the music is fine though.  I just wish there was a better volume setting.  The undersides of the leaves aren't as shimmery as I thought they would be either.  The LED light on the remote and the unit don't seem to be working but that's not a big deal for me.  I like that it can convert to a music box after the mobile isn't needed anymore.  All in all its cute and I'd get it again.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|lep's world I've had it since like June and its totally cute fun and totally kid proof I reccomand this to every age!I love it so much!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love Riordan's series and this one is no exception. I cannot wait for the next book to come out!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I don't know if anything will ever match \\"Night Fall,\\"  but this was a really good Corey read.  Recommended for Corey fans.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the book and am waiting with bated breath for the final book to come out! It was a great follow up to Matched
068484267X|5.0|I stayed away from this book for many years because I thought it would too sad.  Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book.  A lesser writer would make this story depressing.  Its hard to imagine poorer conditions in which to spend ones childhood.  Yet in the hand of this master storyteller, events that would be depressing become colorful and amusing.  I found the book so engaging I did not want to put it down.<br /><br />After finishing this book I immediately read Tis, which begins where this story leaves off.  You probably will too!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Outstanding, especially the last minutes with all the phantoms.  This is the best production I have seen either live or video or movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app! it is my favorite game to play especially on long car trips! it doesn't need wick to play!
B00633W614|5.0|Am truly enjoying this series and am looking forward to the third book.  Love the characters and find that I am emotional about what happens to them...good & bad. Highly recommend this to all!
B0092C2X7U|1.0|I saw another review saying it had device permissions.  I did not even bother getting it.<br />I mean really!  were not going to steal your stupid game from u. Anyway nobody knows how to do that anyway.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Absolutely a must read if you love fantasy. I could not put the books down. Easily one of the best series I've ever read!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app has really helped me I got it just to see if it would be correct so far it has been great app get it works great on my kindel fire
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a spellbinding book that held my attention from beginning to end.  I can't wait to read the sequel.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Don't get me wrong - I'm addicted to the Harry Hole series, and this one held its own. However, there were a few too many &#34;coincidences&#34; for my taste; the number seemed to have jumped from previous books in the series.<br />The book was good though, and I can't wait to pick up the next one to resolve the cliffhanger Nesbo left us with in this one.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|This album is pure Rush. It ranks up there with the best they have put out.  They are at the top of their game.
B004D1AIZ4|5.0|An excellent movie. I really enjoyed this movie, it had my attention from beginning until the last credits, and not just because of the sub titles.I was able to follow the story because of the anime series Samurai7 which is based on this movie.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|Always an interesting read.  However after his third book, alot of the same old same old.  Snowman and Leopard were more interesting reads for me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is a bit more \\"gorey\\" than last, but that hasn't stopped us from streaming it as soon as it becomes available!! Haven't read the comics, and am glad, because the element of surprise gets me EVERY time!! These writers are sheer genius, the effects are amazing, and the characters are so well played you have no choice but to love 'em (or hate them!)  Kudos for an incredible drama!!!
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|I laughed so hard in many places. I still can't believe Tom Cruise can actually SING!!  Julianne Hough was wonderful.
1905236042|5.0|We've owned this set almost a yr. I was afraid it would be<br />A passing thing. My DD loves to get them out and play, wether<br />As a family or friend activity.  We tend to do more laughing than<br />Relaxing. I'm good with that!
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|Kovacs is the future's hardboiled detective bad ass.  Think blade runner on steroids.  Murder is largely a thing of the past thanks to technology that allows storage and retrieval of consciousness, and police now investigate \\"organic damage\\" instead.  Good read.
B008SGMPVU|5.0|Dark Star was a blind buy for me, I had heard of it yet never watched it in it's entirety. I am a fan of early John Carpenter work as well as sci-fi films like Alien, 2001: a Space Odyssey as well as other more independent style sci-fi works.<br /><br />Firstly, Dark Star is not meant to be taken seriously. It is a very odd film, and if not properly prepared, you may not know how to take the tone of the film. There is a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie to try and explain the history of the film, which really gives a good description of the production and outcome of this film.<br /><br />People who enjoy John Carpenter films as well as the writings of Dan O'Bannon, who did the special computer effects for Star Wars and wrote Alien, Total Recall and Screamers will also recognize the style and enjoy the overall feeling of Dark Star.<br /><br />As for the extras, Dark Star gives just enough bonus features for the style of the movie. I could not ask for anything more.<br /><br />For fans of movies like Dr. Strangelove or even fans of spaced out sci-fi films, Dark Star is a great flick and I'm excited to own this in my collection.<br /><br />Just as a side note, those who have heard of or are fans of the indie band PINBACK, this movie is where they got their name, from one of the characters.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Easy to read, interesting (particularly if you grew up using Mac's). Lots of insights into the various players in silicon valley.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|A beautiful book - human, touching and one of those rare books that makes you look inside yourself.  Harold Fry is indeed an unlikely pilgrim who, troubled by the news of his erstwhile friend and work colleague's imminent death from cancer, sets out to mail her a postcard but finds that, once he reaches the first postbox, he can't stop walking.  His walk, which stretches over many weeks, becomes a pilgrimage to Queenie and, in his own mind, will be her eventual salvation.  Of course, in the end the saviour becomes the saved in an engaging, quirky (and not in the least smacking of a self-help book!) journey of self discovery. Read it - you won't be sorry.[[ASIN:B0074D3CAQ The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry: A Novel]]
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This is a must get product if you own a Samsung galaxy s1,2,3!!!<br />This is the best charger I have ever I found!!!<br />I was trying to drain the battery, it feels like it took me forever!!!<br />So if you thinking about getting a charger, get this one, don't get anything else.<br />You won't be disappointed when you get this one.<br />After using this battery pack for about a week, I make the following observations, in order of personal significance:<br /><br />1. Build quality: The battery pack feels, in a word, solid. There is no flimsy plastic deflection if you press on it and no creaky or uneven seams.<br /><br />2. Looks: The pack looks great. Yes it is a fingerprint magnet, but it also wipes cleanly to a beautiful gloss to match most smartphones out there.<br /><br />3. Utility: Very versatile. One port for smartphone and most usb powered gadgets, the other higher amperage port for more power hungry devices, like tablets. I've even used this to charge AA batteries with a usb AA charger. There's nothing I've tried that this won't charge. Also has a built in led \\"flashlight,\\" but more on this later.<br /><br />4. Convenience: This pack will charge easily with any usb charger. Standard micro usb connector means you won't have to go searching for a special cable to plug this in and charge it. This pack will also charge as you are using it. This may seem silly if you're at home, plugging this into your computer or power supply, and your phone into the batter, but if you ever use this with a portable solar charger, as I am with the Goal 0 Zero 19010 Guide 10 Plus Adventure Kit Nomad 7 Solar Charger & 4 AA Battery USB Power Pack, then it is great to charge while the battery pack as per the available light, while still being able to charge your device with the battery pack with reserve and stable power. The led light is also very convenient. Not very bright but it's there and charged up when you need a quick light in the dark, and most importantly, so you can seeyour cable as you plug it into your device (great for iphone, as there really is no way to feel which side is up or down on the charger cable)<br /><br />5. Support, Brand Name: Honestly I never heard of the brand name. At first glance, it seems like just an \\"off-brand\\" made in china product, and the packaging and manual even has chinese alongside english. But the packaging is attractive and not a generic box like you typically see with other generic products. While I have not yet had to call on the company for support, the quality packaging and literature would lead me to believe that this company is out to make a name for itself, and therefore would be responsive. We shall see. The instructions, on the other hand, were terrible. Very engrishy. But the product is so simple and well designed, that I didn't need the instructions.

B000IKQMFO|4.0|Surprising twists and turns as we learn about the way it was in England between Queen Victoria and WWII.  This will challenge your values for sure.  Get you thinking about what our ancestors had to deal with.  Acting is good, story supurb.
B000ICLRHK|5.0|I've had this Blu-Ray for almost 2 years now. It's still enjoyable to watch every time I see it. I got this for under $10.00 so I couldn't pass it up at the time. This was one of my first Blu-Rays I bought. The picture is really nice on this all the way through the movie. It's also presented in a 2:35:1 aspect ratio which I like over the full screen ones. I can't say too much about the audio as I listen through external speakers hooked up to a regular stereo system. It sounds good to me though. I gave it a five star rating for the Blu-Ray quality & the movie itself. If you've seen this in dvd & liked it, I say go ahead & pick it up. You'll enjoy it even more so.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Joanne Rowling has a way with words that makes reading her books a great pleasure.  Her style transcends the age for which she is writing and is the reason she can write for all readers.  She proves this with The Casual Vacancy, her first adult book.  I look forward to all of her future works.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Book 1 was great. Book two was good once you get past the fact that its happening again. I stopped at book 3... It became boring after reading all the suspense of the first two. I'll wait to see the ending in the movies.
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|I am usually a big fan of Tom Cruise, but I have to say this was not one of his better movies. I was impressed with his singing ability, but that was about the only thing worth watching. The music brought back some memories from my high school days, but still not worth the $4.99 I paid to watch online.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great read....once you get passed the contract bit. Lots of suspense in the second and third books! Can't wait for the movie....or to read it again!
1938469003|4.0|This was a very good brewing book for ipa beers. Have enjoyed this book would recommend it to other brewing ipa beers
B009329ZF2|5.0|I have no idea how I like this movie as it will be a Christmas gift!  The trailers looked good and people who say it liked it, so that is all I have to go on.<br /><br />You should have a category with the stars for n/a or something like that.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|When looking for a Kindle Fire HD case, make sure the description says \\"HD\\", otherwise it may not fit, I tried a couple before I found one to fit my Kindle.  I wanted one that was inexpensive & sturdy.  It was easy to fit my Kindle into the case - snapped so easy and I can still access all the buttons and ports.  The stand works great for watching my movies, and so far has not cracked the back or left that obnoxious crease.  the Elastic strap keeps the cover closed nicely, but it's just elastic, so I'm sure it won't outlast the Reader cover.  Only thing I would have liked would have been maybe a small pocket for just a little added convenience, but still a very good, inexpensive case.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Owen's account of the Bin Laden raid races to a gripping conclusion. Unlike the recent TV docudrama, \\"No Easy Day\\" takes the reader through the rigorous training, rehearsals, and then the minute by minute raid on the Bin Laden compound. I think this will become a classic of military heroism.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Absolutely! Crazy for this show! I had wonderful experience with the order process & the DVD set arrived ahead of schedule before the 2nd season started!

B0098VYCCE|4.0|My wife and I really enjoyed watching this movie - the cinematography and acting were great.  It was definitely better than expected.
1619691809|2.0|I am a big fan of DeMille, especially John Corey and KATE but this one was a BIG letdown!<br />DeMille delivered on the wise ass Det Corey comments but that was about it!<br />Where were the hot scenes between John and Kate that have been a signature of his past novels? ( Either John or Nelson need a dose of Viagra )<br />Why do we only see the Panther at the beginning and end of this book?<br />The book starts off great but fizzles a third of the way in!<br />I almost quit reading half way in and I should have because it was down hill from there!
B005TBWN0K|2.0|Unhappy with the new update.  :( It has made the app harder to use for note taking in my opinion. I hope they change it back to the old version...
B0087JTAKW|5.0|My 10th grade son read this and enjoyed it very much. It is hard to get a book for him to read since he doesn't usually like to read much. Read in three days, a record for him.
B004LWZW6U|1.0|After having thoroughly enjoyed the campy, over the top goodness of the first movie (Piranha 3D) I had high hopes for the sequel. Piranha 3DD lacked the humor, story, and acting that made the first one a gem. I feel fortunate that I didn't pay good money to see this in the theater.
B0095R64AO|2.0|Let's put it this way, I couldn't even be bothered to finish watching the movie and usually if I pay to rent a movie, I'll see it thru but this one just wasn't worth my time!
B004I744AS|5.0|Great app. I tried several other dictionary apps before I found this one. I love the word games on the opening screen too.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Nice story and some wonderful stars but drags in some stretches. Then young man who manages the hotel is delightful actor!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really enjoyed the story, but have my doubts as to whether it was really written by Stephen King.  I have read almost everything he has written. Since his accident, his stories have softened.  Miss the old Stephen King.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is lots of fun, my kids love playing it just wish it was easy to get more games.
1475143389|4.0|Like this book a lot.  Great value.  No nonsense approach by Mike Matthews.<br />It's not just the book you buy, you also get real support from the author.<br /><br />After reading it I had some questions like: \\"Where are the eating plans?\\" ... and learned from the author these are actually in the works !<br /><br />Based on this experience: it looks like my next read will be \\"The Shredded Chef\\".<br /><br />If you are serious about this topic.  Just buy the book.<br /><br />/Dave DS
1451648537|5.0|There's two main points I want to make about Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs. First, it's an outstanding book. It's undoubtedly the best biography I've ever read, and is among the best books I've read of any kind.<br /><br />Second, it's a LONG book. It's 571 pages, and it took me a good five weeks to read it (your mileage may vary). But it's long in a good way. It's filled with scores of interesting stories from Jobs' personal and professional lives, and packed with colorful detail. It's not a book to rush through; each section gives you something to stop and think about.<br /><br />Isaacson interviewed over 100 people for the book, allowing him to faithfully describe countless moments throughout Jobs' life. We see the strange alchemy that allowed Jobs and Steve Wozniak - two young men of virtually opposite personalities - to create a computer company called Apple. It's amusing to read how Jobs avoided bathing for a while as a young man, believing his vegetarian diet prevented body odor (he was wrong.) Later on, we see behind-the-scenes stories as Jobs butts heads with Michael Eisner, Bill Gates and other business heavyweights. One of the most amazing revelations of the book is that Jobs, who was adopted, unknowingly met his biological father, who owned a Silicon Valley restaurant.<br /><br />The book works on various levels. On one hand, it's a history book, recounting key events at Apple, Next Computer and Pixar, and the development of such signature products as the iPod, iTunes, and iPhone. While I lived through these events, and often followed the news coverage, I discovered that I really didn't know the full stories until I read this book. I was surprised to discover how close Jobs and John Sculley were at first, before Sculley ousted Jobs from Apple in 1985. I was amused to learn that it was the success of Pixar's \\"Toy Story\\" that in many ways saved Jobs from oblivion and gave him newfound influence.<br /><br />Also, the book is a fascinating look at business and management. Jobs brought a unique style to the workplace  - he was controlling, abrasive, demanding, and perfectionist.  Unlike companies such as Google and Microsoft, he did not like trying a lot of things to see what worked. Rather, he preferred to focus intently on making small numbers of products great. He was both a long-term visionary, and incredible micromanager, fussing over the small details of products and driving many of the people who worked with him crazy in the process. \\"His imaginative leaps were instinctive, unexpected, and at times magical,\\" writes Isaacson<br /><br />Third, the book is an intriguing look at a unique human being. He was abusive and bullying to many people, while still inspiring people to do great work. \\"He could size people up, understand their inner thoughts, and know how to relate to them, cajole them, or hurt them at will,\\" says Isaacson. For all his faults in interpersonal relations, I found myself admiring his passion for accomplishing great things. It's disconcerting to be reading about Jobs' brilliance with making products that are easy to use, while in daily life we are all frustrated by all sorts of poorly designed technology.<br /><br />As much as a I like this biography, no book is perfect and I have three small criticisms. First, the section in which Isaacson discusses Jobs' favorite music is completely unnecessary. Second, I wished at times that Isaacson included more dates in the book. Sometimes, I was trying to determine exactly when something happened, but it wasn't always clear.  Finally, I wish there were more pictures of the other people - besides Jobs and his family - who are mentioned repeatedly in the book.

B008ALA6DW|5.0|I learned my lesson!  To save a few dollars I purchased a 3rd party thunderbolt to gigabit ethernet adapter and it did not work properly.  If the computer moved at all the adapter would disconnect the monitor.  Silly, huh?  I buy a $3200 laptop and try to scrimp on the adapter.  Go figure.<br /><br />The adapter made by Apple works well every time, no matter how much it gets knocks around on the desk.  As I said, lesson learned.

B0091TGWYE|5.0|This is a beautiful case and I love the way it feels!  It is made extremely well. I have held off writing a review until I owned it for a couple of weeks because I wanted to see if I would get used to using the pull strap to get the phone out. At first it seemed clumsy, but now it's extremely easy. The customer service is outstanding I wrote them with my concerns and they addressed it within a few hours with a clear, courteous email! Bravo!  There are companies that listen and respond!
B006S8QY8K|5.0|I rarely watch a movie multiple times, but I loved this movie, and have seen it several times.  I can relate to Richard Gere's character.  I have an office job that pays well and I am generally happy with, but sometimes I wish for something differant.  It's the same for Richard Gere in Shall We Dance.  He steps out of the box and secretly takes dancing lessons.  It is his own secret escape.  Whether you enjoy ballroom dancing or not, I think that you will like this movie.  It is a gem.
B000JQTWPO|2.0|I had a hard time getting through this.  In fact, I couldn't finish it.  I can't say there was anything specifically wrong with the book, it just didn't appeal to me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Having had a neuromuscular disorder all my life, I did not grow up in the way most people do. I'm not saying that my way of growing up was either good or bad, simply that it was my way. This fact-that our experiences are neither good nor bad bad but simply are (that they are good only in the sense that life is worth being lived)-was made fresh to me by The Fault in Our Stars. I found this book to be witty, gripping, and downright brilliant. Ill people, it says with delightful sarcasm, are not especially courageous and admirable for trying to live despite the obstacles they have to face. It is in the nature of every living being to do this. Early in the book, Hazel sums up her own and everyone else's reason for being: \\"I like being a person, and I want to keep at it.\\" The fault, in other words, does not lie in the obstacles themselves but in the all-too-human failure to realise that surmounting obstacles is a natural part of life.

B0055MBQOM|1.0|I have been struggling for two(2) days trying to get this product to install. Do a google search for colormunki driver problems and you will see why. You would think that the required driver would automatically install from the installation cd that comes with the device. On the contrary. It seems that dozens if not hundreds of others have the same problem. Windows cannot find the correct driver on the cd or the web. But it gets better! I downloaded drivers from their website, but not a one of them worked. In fact, one driver that is supposed to be a windows driver turns out to be a Mac driver. I also downloaded and installed the most recent version of the software, but that doesn't work either.  There is something fundamentally flawed with this software if installing it is so difficult.

B00004XONN|5.0|I would like to start off by saying that this is the album that made me a true fan of Radiohead. Yes I was already a fan prior to buying this, but you can say that this album was IT for me. I'd go as far to say it's in my personal Top Ten favorite albums of all time. Yes it's really that good and if you're also a fan of ambient electronic music, you will love it even more. This album captures the dreamlike atmospheres that Aphex Twin, Autechre, and FSOL are all famous for. They also blend together Pink Floyd-esque styles with Thom Yorke's incredible ethereal vocals. All of it just flows together so well too and takes you to a place you won't ever want to leave.<br /><br />I understand that there are some fans who may not understand this album. If you're strictly into Radiohead's rock sound, this album may not be for you at all. But for those of you like me who love Radiohead's more experimental and trippy side, look no further! I can't recommend this album enough personally! Like I said, it's not for everyone though...

B007SGLZP8|1.0|I have been a long-time Grisham fan and like many other fans, I pre-ordered The Racketter, anticipating another legal thriller with the intelligent, intricate, page-turning storytelling that we've come to expect from this author.  Instead, I came away disappointed and wondering aloud whether Grisham himself was running the racket.<br /><br />This novel lacked nearly all of the elements that made some of his previous work so thoroughly enjoyable.  I don't expect a new insight into the human condition from a Grisham book.  I expect a story that keeps me engaged and challenges my thinking, and perhaps brings some interesting aspect of our legal system to life.  I read Grisham because he's a lawyer who has a passion for the law, and he brings us characters who we can at once loathe and love.  But not this time.  Instead, we're given a shallow, predictable story with a protagonist whose faults overcome any human desire to advocate for him.  By the end of the book, I am rooting not for the main character or his barely dimensional collaborators, but instead find myself hoping that somehow the feds -- painted as hapless stormtroopers -- manage to overcome the deep incompetence with which they have been burdened and instead find some way to put this idiot and his friends back in jail.<br /><br />Grisham's own notes at the end of the book paint the picture, and I only wish I had read those first befoe I wasted my time muscling my way through this boring and uninspired story.  As he tells us, it's a work of pure fiction, not inspired by anything, and (as he describes it himself) constructed without research of any kind.  Maybe he should have looked harder for inspiration or perhaps done some of that research.<br /><br />I had never subscribed, before today, to the idea that popular authors eventually fall into the sad trap of unloading poorly structured and thoughtless rubbish on their fans.  Some presume these authors eventually look to cash in on their readers' loyalty for one more payday.  For these authors, truly engaging their fans, energizing their readers and delivering with the same quality of their previous works becomes just too much trouble.  I had never subscribed to that skeptical view until I read this work, a piece that unfortunately diminishes the value of every great story Grisham has told before.  Save your money and your time -- read something else.
1439153663|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  I was carried into that time of American history and felt as if I was living in the story. It was difficult for me to put the book down but afraid that the story would eventually end.  Ms. Grissom is an excellent writer and I look forward to more books from her.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|As always, the Angry Birds app [[ASIN:B004SJ3BCI Angry Birds Free]] is enjoyed by all age groups. Our 5 yr. old grandson, my 61 yr. old husband, my 84yr old dad and our 85 yr. old mother in-law are equally addicted to this fun and brain tickling game. My mother in-law's PT said that this game is excellent for older folks - helps with their eye-hand coordination as well as tunes up their brain at problem solving! So what if she always forgets to touch the screen when the little blue birds fly - one day she will remember and be amazed!!
B0063IH60K|1.0|The game would be great, if it were not for the stupid ads that pop up when you shuffle the deck. Don't the sellers realize that this turns us off to any future RELATION SHIPS..  Having been a programmer, myself. It's just plain tacky...  This is an additional comment, regarding this software.  I was getting a &#34;System Error message&#34; while trying to play this game.  I found out the message was wanting me to sign on to the internet, so this software could update its self.  I strongly suspect there is  spying going on here to, in addition to the tacky adds they inflict on you.  I removed it from my tablet.  I'm tired of being bombarded with spyware and my biggest pet peeve of all; is advertising.  I hate advertising with a passion, and am totally turned off by it.  I'll never buy from aggressive advertisers.  Now who's the biggest looser!, for possible future sales.. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SOFTWARE AT ALL...

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love it ...... I would rate it higher but the pestering for a rating in the middle of the game is kinda annoying
159448385X|4.0|I would rate \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" as four and a half stars. The author successfully captured my attention by grasping a hold of reality and a beautiful and inspiring story about the lives of two women growing up in Afghanistan. The story is made up of a strong and striking friendship with major themes such as sacrifice, love, and heartbreak. The author also did an amazing job making the audience truly understand the characters and make us feel their suffering. This book is also able to let the audience get a taste of what is happening on the other side of the world, while we are all in our little bubble. While I did find the book to be effective and speak to me in a way no book has before, there were still times in the book when I had trouble understanding why and what the author was trying to get across to the audience. That is the reason why I believe the type of audience that should be reading this book should be people who are open-minded and fans of the authors' first book, \\"The Kite Runner.\\" Overall, I truly enjoyed \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a dramatic, inspiring, tear-jerking book.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|It was a very original idea and a great story. Loved it, everyone young and old will enjoy this movie.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS HEART FELT, TEAR DROPPER, INSPIRATIONAL, SOUL SEARCHING AND ANOTHER CHANCE FOR THE IGNORANT TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERDOG AND DOWN TRODDEN.  IT DISPLAYS THE NEGATIVITY OF THE BIGOTS AND RACISTS THAT HIDE BEHIND THE SHIELD OF PERCEIVED PRIVILEGE.
1857885082|5.0|I wish there were more books like \\"watching the English\\" to understand the people and culture of all countries. It is simply a portrait of the main aspects of English society, written by an anthropologist in a very entertaining (and sometimes hilarious) way.<br />There are several chapters that cover most of the social interactions among the English. Of course, there is a dedicated chapter about weather conversartion (which the author says it can be used either as a simple greeting, or an ice-breaker or as a displacement subject when conversation on other matters falters). But she goes much beyond that distinctive classic of Englishness, such as 'the long goodbye rule', 'the self-deprecation rule', 'the seven words' that will demote you to working class, 'the invisible queue rule', 'pub talk rules', 'shopping as saving rule', 'the underdog rule' and many other that not only will descibe you the way the English behave but also how you can blend easily among them.<br />I recommend it to anyone interested in knowing and understanding English society.
B004MNO0BQ|1.0|If your looking for a hockey game then go somewhere else. This game cost more than other hockey games. If you want something more than what the other ones have this is a great game for you,but if you just want a normal hockey game there are plenty of free ones.
0316228532|5.0|I had heard that the casual Vacancy was nothing like the Harry Potter series.  This is a very accurrate assessment.  The book deals with very heavy topics that are both disturbing and thought provoking.  I found it well written.<br /><br />I would not have read the book if JK Rowling were not the author as I tend to read mystery and suspense type books.  However, I am very glad I did read it.<br /><br />I don't recommend the book for anyone that is interested in a happy ending \\"for all concerned.\\"  I recommend it for those who are interested in stepping out of their comfort zone for a current day Peyton Place with social issues brought to the forefront.

1932100660|5.0|I have grown up in the age of technology, where information is too easy to obtain and too difficult to verify. This book has shed the veil on the huge media hoaxes played on us daily related to diet and nutrition. While reading this book I grew very skeptical of the author's claims. Having access to a University's library records I researched his heretic claims and found that he is correct. His book is the most credible of any I have read and has completely changed the way I think of diet.<br /><br />An absolute must-read for the health conscious, or for anyone who's family has a history of serious illnesses (heart disease, cancer, and a plethora of others).
B005DOKM9M|2.0|It only zips on 2 sides so you have to remove the kindle out rather than open it like a book.  Doesn't seem to be very user friendly.  I love the kindle however!

Sort of a Tom Clancy \\"Without Remorse\\" type of book.  [[ASIN:B004O63A3U Without Remorse 1st (first) edition Text Only]]<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />This book started fast, and then bogged down and never really got going again.<br /><br />Very disappointed, because I had heard good things about the series.  I'm willing to try one more.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Give it a while to get over the 'let's talk about religion for 80 pages' and you have one of the best books I've read in years.  I have nothing against the spiritual/existential segments, but it seems out of place here, especially near the beginning of the story.<br /><br />That aside, I absolutely love the story's natural flow and exciting feel, harking back to the classic adventure stories of Hemingway, Jules Vern, and Conan Doyle.  As both a great existential journey and thrilling adventure, this book's a masterpiece.
B009UVWBMA|5.0|Let me just say that I am a massive Taylor Swift fan. I've listened to all three albums and although I thought her music was annoying at first, I quickly warmed up to it. I do listen to an array of other kinds of music though, which are mostly rock/folk/indie/alternative.<br /><br />There are 3 songs on this album that are in the 'annoying-pop' category. Now, I don't really discriminate against 'annoying-pop' anymore (I used to) because there's a time and place to listen to those kinds of songs, be it when you want to just burst out in song in your bedroom, etc. But I believe the placement of those songs play a part to offset the mostly sad, beautiful and tragic (there's a pun here) nature of all the other songs. Also, those three songs were co-written with writers of most of the big pop singles that are on the radio now. The real lyrical nature of Taylor's songs can be found in songs like 'Begin Again'. I won't be the first to say that I am a little disappointed that she produced those 3 songs because she already has a massive fan-base and doesn't need more publicity and popularity all that much. But like she said, this album is adventurous and she probably wanted to explore her options a little more.<br /><br />The rest of the album is ace though. There's a slight 90s vibe to the whole atmosphere of the album (if albums could have atmospheres), like there's nostalgia in the air (and in the reverb). And I have to say that this album contains a few of the most depressing songs I've ever heard her produce out of the three albums. Along the same feeling as the piano version of Forever & Always. Some really depressing songs include Treacherous (one of my favourites), All Too Well, The Moment I Knew, The Last Time.. and although they hurt like hell when I listened and read the lyrics at the same time, it was a pretty beautiful experience.<br /><br />I feel Taylor has noticeably moved on from fairytales and princes. Before this album there was a kind of sparkle and magical feel to her songs but as most people say, she's not a teenager anymore. This album is a nod to a darker and an even more mature Taylor, despite what most critics say because they only listen to We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together and judge her whole image based on ONE song.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this album and feel as much as I did.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I did not receive this. My 2nd kindle in 2 years is not working......I am very disappointed in my kindle product.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Read this from my Amazon purchase for my Kindle. Another good read from Grisham. I found it convoluted at times, even confusing until discovery of the plot and its intricacies. Grisham always keeps his readers captives to a good read. Always want to know what's next and how is this going to resolve.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|AEROSMITH IS LIKE GOOD WINE...THE OLDER THE BETTER IT GETS. THIS ALBUM IS A MIX BETWEEN THE OLD SCHOOL (ROCKS AND TOYS) AND THE NINETIES (PUMP AND GET A GRIP).

THE BAD BOYS FROM BOSTON ARE BACK IN GREAT FORM AND EVERYONE WHO LOVES THIS BAND SHOULD BE HAPPY ABOUT IT.

Emma Thompson has done a truly magnificent piece of work with &#34;Nanny McPhee Returns.&#34;  As much as I liked Nanny McPhee, this movie outstrips it.  Not only did Emma Thompson do a magnificent job writing the screenplay, but she was splendid again as the rather homely Nanny McPhee.<br />When she first comes to the door you find yourself unconsciously asking yourself, &#34;Where did she park her broom?&#34;  Nanny McPhee, at first, is a very homely, overweight woman with warts and a buck tooth that has to be seen to be believed.  Despite her appearance, she definitely projects an air of unquestionable authority, though at first the children do question it, as youngsters will do.  Slowly but surely she teaches them the lessons they need, assisted at times by a thump of her magical cane on the floor.<br />In [[ASIN:B005SMWC0G Nanny McPhee Returns]], there are three rather unruly children who are the despair of their mother, since their father has been called off to WWII.  To throw some pepper into the soup, their two cousins arrive from the city.  It is obvious from the get-go that the two cousins are spoiled brats, so you have a fair idea of just why Nanny McPhee shows up.  The five youngsters (obviously) do not get along at all, and in fact Nanny McPhee has to quite literally show them who's boss, which she does rather well.<br />There is more of her magic, but unlike Mary Poppins there are no songs to carry the story along and, in truth, they are not needed.<br />To add to the mother's problems, her smarmy brother-in-law is trying to get her to sell the farm.  There is an ulterior motive for his actions: he's in debt over his ears to a casino.  Worse, the casino owner has sent his &#34;Hit-men,&#34; actually two rather bloodthirsty women, to collect.<br />An interesting tidbit is the jackdaw that hangs around Nanny McPhee and hold conversations with her.  The bird is forever belching because it has a habit of eating window putty.  This bird, and several other things, move the show right along.  I must add that Dame Maggie Smith (remember her as Prof. McGonnagal in &#34;Harry Potter&#34;?) is absolutely delightful as the little old lady who runs the local store.  She (and several others) remember Nanny McPhee very kindly.  At the end of the film you find out why, but only if you saw the first film.<br />All in all, this is a truly delightful film, in spite of a little over-the-top acting on the part of the brother-in-law and the two ladies(?).  If you liked the first Nanny McPhee, you are going to love this one, too.  I do highly recommend it, and I'm very glad I have it.ting window putty.

B00973DDN2|4.0|Kinda like Samstown and Day & Age put together with stronger elements. Day and Age had some good songs but they faded after a couple months of listening to them. This album has more songs that keep the great feeling you get when listening to them.
B000F1IQNM|4.0|I could think of a few families who could have definitely benefited from a REAL Nanny McPhee, but let's not go there just now.  Nanny McPhee is a soft spoken no-nonsense person who let's the children know what is expected of them.  She never voices the \\"Or Else!\\" though it is sort of implied.  The way she handles these children is rather interesting, as well as the grown-ups involved.  What you'll notice is that as the children learn each point she wants to teach them, part of her witch-like features vanishes, until what is left at the end is a very beautiful woman.  She also makes it very clear that \\"As long as you don't want me but need me, I'll stay.  When you want me but no longer need me, I'll leave.\\"<br />The reason I couldn't quite give it five stars was some over-the-top acting by some of the characters.  The children weren't too bad, but some of the adults were a bit much.  Still in all, it's a very pleasant film and I did enjoy it.  I'm quite sure you will, too, so go ahead and buy it.  I don't think you'll regret having done so.

B0092C2X7U|4.0|this game is not as bad as the reviews say. it takes a little while getting used to playing, as in the learning curve. although it does suck you can't go to any other levels without completely beating the first. and no idea why it needs full Internet access..
B00000K0EA|2.0|I always say that License to Kill is my least favorite Bond film but after watching Tomorrow Never Dies again I may have to rethink my assessment. License has some really bad parts but Tomorrow is just so blah, so pointless. There is almost nothing to like about the film. I remembering watching it the fist time and thinking that the bridge of the stealth boat was well designed which shows how much I was reaching for ANYTHING to like.<br /><br />The opening may be the worst of any Bond film with Brosnan continuing on as a one man army. It felt to me like the writers were trying to overcompensate for the fact that Brosnan is the wimpiest looking of all the Bond actors. The part where Bond ejects the copilot up through the bottom of a jet flying above him is something more akin to a Wiley Coyote cartoon than a Bond film. Later in the film Bond beats up four thugs and it really was humorous with Brosnan's skinny frame swinging around weak little kicks and chops. Mind you I do like Pierce Brosnan and enjoyed Goldeneye greatly but he's no good at physical fighting and the writers just doomed him with the dialogue.<br /><br />Speaking of dialogue. God. It's bad enough that Bond cracks double entendre's like a horny twelve year old but when Moneypenny joins in I want to cry. Through fourteen films Lois Maxwell always retained her dignity but in her second film Samantha Bond is calling Bond a `cunning linguist' and helping to make MI6 look like an elementary school operation. It's hardly more mature than giggling at titmouse and sperm whale.<br /><br />Jonathan Pryce is so over the top you can't possibly take him seriously and ranks as perhaps the worst villain in Bond history. Pryce is a competent actor but completely wrong for the roll and nobody could have made that dialogue work. The only believable moment was after Bond makes his three thousandth pun and Carver seemed legitimately exasperated at 007's childishness.<br /><br />There was famously no chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and Teri Hatcher but likewise Michelle Yeoh seems completely out of place in the film and amazingly superfluous despite her considerable screen time. The lengthy banter between Bond and Q about car insurance feels more like a preplanned comedy routine than spontaneous interaction. Even M sadly joins in as straightwoman for Bonds lame puns. The film is just a bunch of characters bumping about saying dopey things.<br /><br />The action is cartoonishly silly but the pinnacle may be the sorry chase scene with Bond and Wai-Lin on a motorcycle being chased by a helicopter. Everything feels perfectly staged which is not unique for a Bond film but this sequence may be the worst ever. The pair find themselves on a roof as the helicopter inexplicably hovers motionless next to the building. Bond could have rode off in several other direction but in a move so brazenly pointless that it would have embarrassed Bo and Luke Duke he backs up the motorcycle and jumps the helicopter. Later the helicopter is pursuing our heroes with its blades angled 45 degrees to try and chop them up. Bond and Wai-Lin slowly work their way through a busy crowd and the helicopter creeps along behind with a speed so ponderous that one has to question if a copter is even capable of doing it (and I doubt it is).<br /><br />Goldeneye is one of my favorite of the Bond movies but man was the second film a letdown and even when I originally saw it in the theater I knew I had seen something bad. The plot actually is fairly inventive and topical but man was the execution terrible. I suspect this kind of junk was why they finally did the reboot even as the Brosnan movies were raking in the money.ce Brosnan and Teri Hatcher but likewise Michelle Yeoh seems completely out of place in the film and amazingly superfluous despite her considerable screen time.

The Dark knight Rises, is a good game though...
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|Every kids worst nightmare.... boogie man clowns!  Was scared *(&&(() when I was younger so it was only fair of me to introduce this movie to some little kids who needless to say were sleeping in their parents room for a couple nights after not even watching all of the movie. hahahaha<br /><br />Great Flick 1 of my all time favorites!!

B0061S073A|5.0|I'll never forget posting in Amazon's forums only to be told by the masses, \\"You are a bad parent. You should be watching everything your kids do on the Kindle if you're going to let them play with it.\\"<br /><br />Yea, right.  So says the crowd with 0,1, or 2 kids.  I have 5.<br /><br />Big problems we have: the 3 year old knows how to turn the volume up which annoys everyone trying to watch TV or do home work.  So... this app lets us pick which apps the kids get, prevents them from exiting from the 'kid mode' setup... lets us turn wireless off... and best of all... they can't change the volume anymore.<br /><br />Whoever wrote this, if you put a trial version together and sell it for $10 after 30 days I'd buy.
B007JGAR6U|4.0|Well. I like small portable flashes. I've gone through a few Sunpak 121's (they're really cheap, so I don't mind) and contemplated a Leica SF or Contax TLA200 flash, which both use awkward batteries. Eventually this Fuji flash came out, promising to be compact with good build quality and manual controls. I found one slightly used on ebay. I have a X100, though my primary camera is a Mamiya 7 medium format film camera.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-awesome build quality, seems to match the X-Pro1 and certainly does fine on my X100<br />-takes AAAs...not quite as convenient as AAs but still a lot better than those crazy batteries that other similar flashes take.<br />-TTL metering on the Fuji cameras is quite good (though I use it mostly on manual)<br />-controlling the flash is a breeze. for this, I would give it 5 stars. really excellent, and easy to switch between manual and TTL.<br />-it works really conveniently as an off-camera flash, triggered by your camera's built-in flash. I love this feature, my old Nikon DSLR had it and I can't wait to use it more with the fuji (although I suppose with a hotshoe extension cord, you could retain TTL like the Nikon somehow had).<br />-comes with a leather case and a little tripod adapter (as it should for over $200). both nicely made.<br />-it locks into the fujis with a little button release...very nice feature. it seems to still mount on all other cameras, though it won't lock into the hotshoe.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-like most of the X100's controls, the exposure dial on the EF-X20 is very loose and prone to being moved accidentally.<br />-it's a little bit too big for the X100. from the photos I've seen, it looks pretty balanced on the X-Pro1 (and it feels like nothing on my Mamiya 7), but on the X100 it is a little heavy compared to the camera.<br />-the auto-startup and shutdown. When you turn off the camera, the flash turns off too. Okay, cool. But if the camera is on and the flash is off, and you try to turn the flash on, itwill start up for about a quarter of a second and then just go back off. after six or seven times of this, it will finally stay on. If the flash is already on and then you turn on the camera, the flash will go off. I'm not sure if my unit is defective, but that's pretty annoying. I discovered that if you turn them both on at the same time, they work.<br /><br />Overall, this flash functions pretty well on the Fuji cameras, once you get it turned on. I really wish this flash had an auto setting with a mini exposure chart on the back (like the sunpaks do! they can be used with any camera really easily). I guess if you only shoot digital, manual mode is a fine alternative (I use it plenty on film too). Is it the perfect flash for any camera? It's just okay for that. It's really small and portable, much stronger and higher up than the X100's flash, and would make a good addition to any kit. I use flash a lot, and this one is probably the best option for the X100 and X-Pro1 unless you need to be bouncing light.

It brings out a full range of emotions - disgust, sadness, empathy.  I would highly recommend it.

That is what kept me reading page after page. I am not one to comment on the grammer since that is not the reason a read any book.<br />If you are not one to be offended by different lifestyles and want a unique love story this one will keep you turning the pages and wanting more.
0307700879|1.0|I just finished reading The English Patient. I don't know if I can really say \\"finished\\" since I skipped quite a few pages due to the dullness of the book. It is one of the dreariest, most slow-paced and unnecessarily wordy books I've ever read. I wonder how it even won a prize? You never really get to know or like any of the characters, who are all terribly boring. The book jumps from scene to scene, and you're never really sure who's saying what. And like other reviewers have commented, nothing really happens. I'm yet to watch the movie, but I hear it is really good. But as for the book, don't waste your time.

B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have become more and more disenchanted with the Scarpetta books, but I keep buying them thinking Cornwell will surprise us with one of her early style \\"great mystery stories\\".  The Bone Bed was just overall weak with a jumpy plot.  I didn't feel anything was well developed for the reader.  With that being said, the court room scene was great, but we were never really told why the judge was so against Kay. In the end of the story,  I had to go back in the book to find out \\"who the villain\\" was and how he was connected to the main characters.  I think Corwell is just tired of the series...and her readers still want more!  She needs to go back and read her first few books again and get \\"inspired\\".
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|Just when I thought Christmas had been done to death, in flies Arthur Christmas. British to its core yet universal in its appeal, this often wildly funny romp through 24 hours of one seminal holiday year demonstrates in spades what junk most Christmas movies are. It is, to beat a dead horse in a season of cliche, an instant classic.
B008ALAHA4|2.0|These are horrid little things. They work, yes. You plug one end into your laptop and the other into an older power cord, and it passes power through. But your power cord sticks way out as a result. Awkward and kind of a hack.<br /><br />If you find yourself needing one of these things, buy 5 instead. You'll need them. That's because they're exceedingly easy to lose. Apple provided no lanyard/keychain loop or hole on the thing, so you just can't ensure they won't disappear on a regular basis. In fact, you can guarantee that you *will* lose them on a regular basis.<br /><br />Apple, please redesign these so they have a loop hole somewhere! Or at least provide a snap-on tether or something - SOMETHING! Please?
B008NABUU8|5.0|I am a civil engineer and find this game very intriguing. The idea of having to be creative with limited materials and budget is a real world scenario. Getting a second chance after failure may not be realistic, but that is what computer simulations are for. Test it on the computer before you spend millions on the ground.
0385344333|2.0|Like many of the other reviewers here, I'm a big Reacher fan and have read them all. This seemed like a big departure from the others in one big, simple way. We like Reacher because he goes out there and kicks serious butt. Okay, yes that seems a little primal and perhaps immature but anyone who says that they are a Reacher fan and doesn't enjoy reading the detailed accounts of his step by step pounding of some in-bred, mouth breathing redneck is just lying. Not to say that that is all there is to his character but these scenes are what make Reacher and the series what they are. In this story Reacher does not lay a hand on anyone until the final pages and even then it is a complete anti-climax. Overall a very tedious and boring story and I wouldn't be surprised if it was not even written by Child.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and quite soothingly pretty.  Some of the levels are even a bit challenging! I recommend it for anyone.
B009CPES4I|5.0|A wonderful way to spend an evening...or morning...or afternoon.  This is just a lovely movie.  The caliber of the performances are absolutely as you would expect of this magnificent cast.  I highly recommend taking the time to watch this one!

1451650728|5.0|I don't know how else to describe it, it is simply the best Star Trek book that has been written...  Without giving away any spoilers I really hope the last decision made by you know who will be somehow reversed, the author can't do what he did and then go on to do with it, what he did.  That may sound cryptic or even insane but after reading the book you will (I hope) come to agree with me.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Remember when you first heard MAGGIE MAY, HOT LEGS, DO YOU THINK IM SEXY OR YOURE IN MY HEART?, WELL this cd is Rod stewart singing Christmas Carols. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.

B005LAII7G|5.0|In preparation for this movie I studied up with the first 2 Dredd Collections available here on Amazon.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Judge-Dredd-Case-Files-01/dp/1906735875/ref=pd_sim_b_1<br />http://www.amazon.com/Judge-Dredd-Complete-Case-Files/dp/1906735999/ref=pd_sim_b_1<br />(You are welcome Amazon)<br /><br />That being said, the movie is absolute perfection, couldn't have hit the world, feel, and one-liners more on the head.<br /><br />Karl Urban IS Dredd.<br /><br />Shame they had to release it almost exclusively in 3D, it really pushed the uninitiated (To Dredd, not 3D, which I could live without) audience away I think.<br /><br />BUY THIS! RENT THIS! WE NEED A SEQUEL!
B008KE3960|5.0|Great game lots of fun. Its reallybentertainjng but you might be a little hummed because you have to buy somebody the features and sorrybforbthe strange typos I'm typing this on my kindle fire
B004SRWW0C|5.0|Very helpful product. I was rooting and flashing a Sprint Galaxy Nexus over to a Verizon MVNO (Page Plus Cellular) and Root Explorer was very helpful in finding and setting the files and permissions that I needed. It saved me hours of work. Great app!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Very handy, and especially like the verbal pronunciation.  My husband is a writer and he uses this quite often. We both use it to grow our vocabulary.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie you are missing out!!  Great action!  This is one movie you will watch multiple times and never get tired of viewing.
B00005R2IS|5.0|The dvd I have is DOUBLE SIDED. It has the movie on one side (the original, unedited version) and SPECTACULAR SPECIAL FEATURES on the other side. WHAT A GREAT DVD (SPECIAL EDITION)!!! The SPECIAL FEATURES include 2 DOCUMENTARIES--one of GIBSON'S start in acting (I thought it was REALLY interesting). The SECOND DOCUMENTARY is of the MAKING OF THE MOVIE (TRULY AMAZING!!!).<br />CINEMATIC HISTORY that set the STANDARD for AUSTRALIAN MOVIE MAKING (I REALLY LOVE IT). The POST APOCALYPTIC story of a world of SAVAGE, DEGENERATED HUMANITY. IF you like CAR CHASES AND CRASHES, this movie is one YOU'LL REALLY LIKE!!! DOESN'T GET ANY MORE INTENSE THAN THIS!<br />The precurser for the movie ROAD WARRIOR. DEFINITELY SEE THIS ONE FIRST, if possible. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SPECIAL EDITION DVD. Again, the special features are TOTALLY SPECIAL--THEY ARE KILLER!!<br />This dvd offers the CHOICE of WIDE SCREEN or FULL SCREEN. I can't believe how much is offered on this one dvd.
B000002UAC|5.0|The CD arrived on time, and in perfect condition.  It replaces a scratchy and skipping LP.  It appears that I haven't outlived, or ruined, \\"my music\\".  Fab!
B0017K8X5Q|1.0|Ordered this (hesitantly, based on the reviews) because I had a case that recommended this specific model and it seemed like a good idea to get a little more airflow around the video card. Low and behold 2 months into ownership, with the system being turned off overnight, the bearing went south and it makes a TON of noise now. Not to mention it's relatively low CFM..<br /><br />Would not buy again.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I fell in love with Lee Childs writting and Jack Reacher since book 1, I have read all his REACHER series and short stories this one is the last one, I believe  and am impatiently waiting for the next one.You will not put it down!
B0092C2X7U|1.0|this game is way to hard. the first level is nearly impossible and no to mention the fact that the developer was writing fake reviews.jsjclbekc dksbdjd xjddjd
B005723JSQ|5.0|Suprisingly entertaining, a light and very enjoyable read.Author is very humorous and did not put the book down, was done in 2 days.
B004I744AS|5.0|Learn how to pronounce words; spell words; find words within words; match words to one another etc etc etc all around great learning app to have.
B00846REIS|3.0|Thought it was good, but too similar to 50 Shades series! Was an easy read and I really couldn't put it down. I don't think I will read the rest of the series though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There is a reason why this book has so many positive reviews. The characters are perfectly developed, the setting perfectly established, the story is enthralling and once you start reading you will have a hard time putting this book down. Hugh Howey has truly created a scifi masterpiece and I'm looking forward to reading more of his work.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game rocks great graphics fun for all ages. my kids love to play too. cant put this game down.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great time waster.  only issue is I have 14000 coins and am on level 200 and just cannot get any more dozer dollars.  I have about 20 of each prize now.  seems to be getting boring now. hope the update adds some more fun back into it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I cannot say that the story was surprising in any way, shape, or form. Then again, it wasn't intended to be either. Getting an inside view of the killing of Osama Bin Laden was interesting and the main focus of the story but getting there was so educational that I found myself almost ashamed of how little I really know about the most elite team in our U.S. military, the SEALS. I thought I had a pretty good idea of who these boys were and what they were all about until I read No Easy Day. Wow was I ready to poke my head in the mud! The story builds up to the actual Bin Laden killing by introducing some of the basic SEAL training techniques and then takes you on a few tours in on other deployments before the big one. The big one was just another day at work for these dudes, pretty normal stuff...for them. I enjoyed it and I believe you will too. I bought the Kindle version simply because it's easy to take with me but I missed out on the picture inserts. I think I'll spring for the paper version too. It's worth it.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is a good little game with great graphics and the music is very soothing. It takes a long time to perform tasks though, so having a lot of friends that send you gold can help speed things up. I'm quickly becoming addicted to this game.
B006H5120E|5.0|This is so worth buying. I was completely satisfied with how quickly it got shipped to me and how it lived up to it's hype. This movie looks so great, if you have a decent sound system and big screen T.V it will feel like if you were there the night the Titanic sank.Sadly enough I still haven't experienced it in it's 3D version yet. Yeah this is a great buy to add to your movie collection, especially if you are a collector of classical movies and if you are a fan of Leo and Kate its a must have. Hope you enjoy it like i did :)
B005L38QK2|1.0|I've owned two of these mice.<br /><br />The first one lasted about 2-3 months, the right-click broke. It still worked, but it felt very soft and lost the \\"click\\" sound whenever you... click. So I replaced it with a new one.<br /><br />The second one lasted 4-5 months. I'm getting the exact same symptom as the last one, as well as the two left side buttons no longer work. For a while I had to press the two side buttons really hard (not too hard where they'd break) whenever I turned my computer on to get them working. Now they don't work, period.<br /><br />I've bought several Blizzard accessories including the WoW headset (twice), the StarCraft 2 Z-Board, the StarCraft 2 Marauder Keyboard, and of course the Diablo III mouse (twice). I regret buying every one of them, except for the Marauder Keyboard. The Marauder is very nice and has lasted a very long time and still lasting. It's quite clear to me now that Blizzard's accessories are usually made with really cheap material and cost a lot just because of the Blizzard name on them.<br /><br />With all that being said, I don't recommend buying this or any other Blizzard accessories. Ever.
B00978V35C|5.0|Wonderful album......been a Robert Cray fan for 20 years and this is one of his finest.....One of his finest works, on par with Strong Persuader.
B00846REIS|5.0|Better than 50 Shades. I read it, and Reflected in you and then re read them in 3 days!! I could not stop. The main characters are great. Story line is catchy. Love it! Highly recommend.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This book was a fairly easy read, although it may be a little dificult for those not medically inclined.  I am a R.N., and I found the book to be too technical....the proof of Heaven, I found to be lacking....he skips from one plane to another....coming up from the muck into the presence of OM.....who is OM?  Maybe I missed that...as a christian, I found his explanation to be conflicting...why would God want a non beleiver to deliver the good news?  Does Dr. Alexander practice what he preaches????  Maybe he will write a sequel and convince us all.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Bared to you was good, but this book was better!! The storyline is so good. The characters are the types of people you just want them together. It's a must read!!
B008J05EL8|1.0|The app will not open and nothing in the help even mentions this possibility. It is hard to imagine an app not worth $5 but this one has proven to have no value.<br /><br />I have been disappointed in the Kindle Fire from the moment I powered up the unit. I was amazed that the Office Sweet came without fonts and then to find out the app to correct the lack of fonts is useless.<br /><br />I can come to no other conclusion than to believe that Amazon has sold out quality for the chance to make a quick buck.
B0065RIJ3W|4.0|I am very frustrated that Amazon don't ship to Norway? Tried to order the paperback copy, but they would not ship to Norway. Why?????<br /><br />I bought the Kindle version, really no problem as I like to read on screen (but I miss a lot of functionality in the Kindle reader for Windows)<br /><br />Back to the actual book...<br /><br />This is my first book about Aquaponics. I have read quite a lot about the subject on various internet pages. I can't say I found a lot of knew information in the book, but the information I had spent months finding and collection on many sites, was all in this book.<br /><br />If you are planning to start your own aquaponic system, or you want to learn more about the subject, I think that this book is for you. All in all a great book.
1451662432|1.0|I wonder what it is like for his family to see in black and white the kind of man he really is. What an awful guy, and a lousy governor. And now he has gone back to acting-to his fantasy world-and nobody cares. He is a has been.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|The main character is fascinating and the story delivery is well done.<br />I will buy the next one in the series.<br />I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was not riveting enough for me to read it again.
B009L32R5I|3.0|Steve Hackett's second attempt at covering older Genesis tunes is more ambitious than the first edition but not quite as successful.  The first \\"Genesis Revisited\\" album was a more adventurous take on some classic Genesis songs with different singers bringing their own interpretations to these well-known songs.<br /><br />\\"Genesis Revisted II\\" loses the adventurous nature of the first one and replaced it with more straight-forward recreations of Genesis classics.  This sounds great in theory but Hackett attempts to recreate the songs almost exactly, to the point that there's little new to be entertained by.  This is further complicated by the fact that some of the singers have voices very similar to Peter Gabriel's or Phil Collins (including his son Simon who sings a verse during Supper's Ready).  I would have much preferred if some license was taken with the songs, either in the choice of singer or in the arrangements.<br /><br />Having said this, the songs are the star here and this album is like a greatest hits collection of Hackett-era Genesis.  Three stars are given for the material presented here but two stars taken away for the lost opportunity to do something really fun and adventurous.
B0089LIY7I|4.0|At first this album was a real disappointment as it contained only one new song.  In the samples you could only hear minor changes to old favorites so why repurchase them if you already own them.  I read some of the other reviews and finally took the plunge.  It was less than $10 from one of my favorite groups.<br /><br />Having listened to the music and knowing their songs so well, this was more about knowing what was changed and different.  A lot more of the Deep Purple background crept into this album, with changes in tempos, new solos and a harder overall feel.  This is also a live album and had the raw feel of that media.  In my iPod this stayed in the rock category instead of the Celtic/New Age section.<br /><br />I find that I continue to listen to the previous albums more than this one, but think my husband prefers this one in his iPod.  First time he listened to the album, he walked in, sat down and stayed to listen to the entire album even though he was in the middle of a project.  So I am going to give this a 4.5 star rating (4 stars for me and a solid 5 for my husband).
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This is an excellent book. It is a very quick read that I did wish was longer. It is well written story and the ending will take you by surprise!
B008645YEE|1.0|After I played the cd, I was surprised to what I was hearing. I am no musical expert, but the music was completely foreign and what ever the composer was trying to complete, this was a total disaster. Original is cool, but the composer missed the mark. The original sound track did not have enough of the batman theme in the track. Let's get it right next time.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I thought I was buying Everwood Season 1 in MINT condition.  I found out today<br />that is not the case!  The first section of two discs is firmly attached to the<br />main holder but the other two are floating loose in the holder!  Obviously, this<br />is not a NEW ITEM!<br /><br />I NEVER BUY USED DVD'S and if I clicked on the wrong item, then it's my fault<br />but if I didn't, then I am unhappy!<br /><br />Naturally, I have not had the opportunity to play the discs for condition since<br />I just received the package yesterday!<br /><br />I have an extensive DVD library and take excellent care of the packaging so that<br />someday when I'm no longer around, my daughters can either keep discs or present them to Amazon for resale in good condition. I am 91 and in excellent and feisty health!<br /><br />I truly am quite disappointed!<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Amelia Ranche
B0075FLTV2|5.0|With George Michael music you can't go wrong. Listening to this album one minute you are tapping your foot to the song and the next you have tears rolling down your face.  This man has a wonderful range and voice!
B005PK553C|5.0|When we were watching this on television, we kept asking ourselves, \\"what can they possibly do next?\\"  The sheer number of horror movie tropes and stereotypes is staggering.  However, this is a clever show, and it knows what it's doing.  Whereas season 2 is all about communal fears that America had in the 1960s, this first season is about personal fears and the things that we, as individuals, are most afraid of in America (losing our money, our partners cheating on us, our families breaking down, etc.).  The house in this show is great at reflecting back on its inhabitants their worst fears and most secret guilty desires.  It has a way of giving each of the Harmons what he/she wants while at the same time taking away something vital.<br /><br />It's classic gothic, and also classic horror.  I really can't recommend it enough to people who love horror or even people who study the gothic.
B004LL1HM4|4.0|A great album from a promising new band. Both of their full-length albums have been the cream of the crop.
B00992CF6W|4.0|awesome but its a little confusing on survival mode because of the craft thing. what's up with that please help.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|Although I was a little worried about ordering a used product, I went ahead with it anyway based on the good product reviews and I was not disappointed! The movie had minor damage to the case a small scratch here or there on the disc, but it did not effect how the movie played.  Over all, I am very satisfied!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read!!! Could not put it down! Reminded me of the old Grisham books. It's another book ready to be a blockbuster movie in the future!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed this  trilogy that left me wanting more! After I read the last book I will start all over again !
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual, he's the best!  Read the book in one and one-half days.  Would definitely recommend it to family and friends.  Love his books!!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed in The Racketeer since it reminded me of the same story line as THE FIRM, where events/timing have to work out to a tee to save the main character.  The reader is out of the loop as to why things are being done in The Racketeer, just as they were in The Firm.  I enjoy Grisham's novels, but this one leaves you a few steps behind the story line till the end.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of the best game I ever play in my life. Cant think of nothing better then this. This is CrazyJohnceno280.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book just wished I had of known the the final book won't be available until May 2013...
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Well after watching the film- which was very confusing at first I decided to read the book. 1 week later and I'm now almost finished book three. If you loved books like Harry Potter, you will like this. Although- it's a little violent at times it has brought me to tears other times. Can't wait to finish the final book, absolutely brilliant.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Well worth the money.  I will be looking forward to the next game.  I loved this mystery type game.  I found it challanging and yet not too hard.  GREAT STORY LINE!  Try it!  My daughter will be playing it next.  It is PG.  She loves a good mystery and puzzles..
B005K2YRVG|4.0|when i first recieved this case, i was amazed. i looked like it could withstand anything while the kindle on the inside will still be safe. inside the case, there is a velvet like material to coat the kindle. the main thing i dont like is that me kindle paperwhite doesnt really fit. i hav to squeeze it in
B007THA4FI|4.0|I did not read all the Harry Potter books because I like more realistic stories. This book revolved around the lives of a community that was in a bit a turmoil. She did weave an interesting story line involving both young and old. Slowly intertwining the lives of the people who lived in this small village. There was a slow build to the story. As I started to read the book the word mundane came to mind but the more I read I must say I enjoyed it!
B0085RQLXK|1.0|For those of you like myself who grew up on Aerosmith, this album should come with a warning label that reads:  The Aerosmith you thought you knew is gone, never to return. I thought I would give them one more shot with this new CD because frankly, they earned it by rocking me to the core in the 70's and early 80's prior to \\"the great sellout\\".  Sadly, since Tyler and crew put down their heroin needles, and began to pander to today's musically bereft youth, they also managed to lose their ability to craft solid Rock songs. Alas, American Idol has ruined America's perception of what rock is and should never be.  Seriously... This CD stinks!
B007W7P5L8|1.0|Expected the cover to be flexible to help set it up as a stand for reading or playing.  Even with the cover, you still have to hold Kindle in your hand while reading or playing games.  Just disappointed.
B0078XHAB4|4.0|A story that draws you in like a warm blanket - beautifully written - well worth a read. . .
B005HSL626|2.0|A co-worker mentioned this game to me about three days before it was the free app of the day.  Given her enthusiasm, I had to try it.<br /><br />My first mistake was not realizing this is an Open Feint social app.  I deleted all my Open Feint apps ages ago because I had many problems with them.  But I decided to try it, anyway.<br /><br />The game involves swiping your screen as fast as you can to slice fruit, but stay away from bombs.  There are bonus fruits.  It was amusing for about two minutes.<br /><br />I know this game is popular, but I don't understand why.  Uninstalled.  There are many games that are fast, furious, and fun.  This was just fast and furious.
B00846REIS|3.0|I like chick lit, but this was just bad writing and too much. It wasn't believable and seemed like a raunchier version of Fifty shades of grey.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down and had to continue on with the story. Can't wait until the next one comes out. I already pre-ordered it.
B004U8VQOW|5.0|Watched this movie in I MAX a few years ago and was hooked. My daughter and I share a major interest in the stars and what could be beyond our galaxy. (She does know a lot more than I do) But was glad to come across it on Amazon. Bought it immediately and would recommend this to any star gazer out there.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Harry Bosch is a complex protagonist with strong ethics, but without cloying sanctimony.  A highly focused persistence and strong work ethic leads him to press on in the face of daunting opposition.  The result is good story well told.
0316228532|1.0|This book really just stinks.  I bought it because, of course, Harry Potter, figuring she could come up with a good story or two.  But not this time around.  It is a boring book, about boring, uninteresting, flacid personalities that she is unable to lift off the floor of this no real plot, stupefying ill-written and complete waste of your time.  Heed my warning, do not waste your money, wish I could mine back plus penalties against the author for torturing us all with this crap.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|So boring and I am shocked that I struggled thru 57 chapters. Time to retire John Corey mr demillie.  Stop writing for money and go back to your great stories and fun reading old style......you should refund money to your loyal readers.
B009PEKRY6|5.0|I love Bridgit Mendler. Most of the girls on Disney who have released albums are either really good at acting or singing but not both. Bridgit is the only one that I've seen so far that is actually great at both! Her singing voice is really beautiful and her style is so unique. I've enjoyed listening to \\"Hello My Name Is...\\" and can't wait what Bridgit does next! It's a shame that she's not more popular! She deserves it :)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan continues to amaze me! His writing and attention to detail is outstanding in this third installment. I went back and read the first two books again before starting this one, and it was well worth it. It's amazing how he has the ability to tell the story through seven different people. Can't wait for number 4!
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this right after reading fifty shades of grey trilogy, at first I was like this is a cheaper version of fifty.... but by chapter 2 I was drawn into the tragedies that tied them together.
1423140605|4.0|This is the third book in the series of 5. It left me with a cliff hanger. Now I have to wait another year to find out what happens with our heroes. That is the only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I loved it!
B00006AG5N|5.0|A must have CD for every fan of music. An album full of number ones from the artist who has sold more records (over one billion) than any other artist.<br /><br />This is quite simply, brilliant, spanning 3 decades of some of the greatest music ever recorded.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|This is one of the best hardwares that I got for my Macbook pro. I've been using this product for 14 months now, and it has never given me any problems. I connect it to a large Samsung TV to watch streaming videos and films online, and it works great.<br /><br />It's been pretty battered by all the connecting and disconnecting that I've done, but it's still in one piece.<br /><br />Video looks good. Audio is good. Works as well as it claims to be.
B001PPLKI0|5.0|An unbelieveable Gospel compilation. The best all-around Elvis Gospel collection available. Sound is superb and Elvis sings each song with the passion and sincerity it deserves. Buy it. You will not be disappointed!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I first saw this mentioned on the Daily Show in an interview with the author.  It was an amazing, captivating story. I don't know whether to call it a love story, because it was. Or a thriller, because you were never sure what would happen next. Everything was satisfactory including the end.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Interesting read, enough sexuality to keep one's interest, enough story to make it believable.<br />Flawed character, Christian, is slowly coming around to normality.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I have played many versions of Mahjong on my computer and do enjoy it so much.  Now I can take it with me wherever I go.  It is challenging and certainly not boring.  Never get tired of the lay outs as there are so many of them.<br />Would recommend this game to anyone that has time to spend.  Also keeps my eyes and mind in sync.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|This movie is great. Funny and looks great in blue Ray. Movie to sit with family and a bowl of popcorn.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|some things that happen in this story are physically impossible which is a shame because it distracts form the great storyline.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|good yarn  but that's all i was looking for.  Will be somewhat difficult to convert into a movie, but who knows?
B005S9EJ14|3.0|Over all it was a good flick, but the story was a little weak for such a great cast, and the script could have been fleshed out a bit more for my taste. There were several areas that even the<br />star studded cast could not help, leaving me to think it might have fared better under the skills of a different director, but it still falls back to a weak script,and,or story.<br />That being said, another might find it quite enjoyable,it does have it's moments with great scenery and feel of the country.
B00000IZOR|3.0|I ordered the toy for my 1 year old DD because of the movie I saw it in.  The cord for the phone handle is so short that even a baby needs to bend down or put her head very near the toy just so she could put the handle against her ear.  It would have been so much better with a longer handle.  I'm thinking of cutting and attaching a longer cord so it would be easier to play with.  The dialer makes a ringing sound when you dial it and the eyes move up and down when the phone is pulled.  Overall, pretty good IF the cord handle was longer.
B007PFD90G|3.0|This book is bloated and hard to read. I have the feeling that the author is stretching to make himself look important & intellectual.
1401322786|3.0|I knew I was going to run into this problem - there was no chance (ok, very very slim chance) that I was going to be overwhelmed by this book. Sure, it may have been good, but I knew it wasn't going to match up to The Five People You Meet In Heaven. To be fair, I wasn't necessarily underwhelmed either - more neutral - just plain whelmed (thank you 10 Things I Hate About You).<br /><br />Moving on...the book served as a kind of modern day fable. Fictional story turns into a life lesson, and we're all better off because of it. Right? Not exactly...in this case, we have Father Time attempting to teach the two main characters just how precious time is. Sounds a bit fanciful and hokey? Well yeah, it was. Overall, it wasn't  a particularly bad book - it was quite an easy read and the Sarah/Victor's stories were rather enjoyable - I just think the story was a little contrived.
B003F3PMYI|1.0|OMG, why does it take 'forever' to get to each point?<br /><br />I was hoping that there was some sort of summary that reflected on and expounded on the points mentioned in the author's videos, but no such luck.  At least then the book might have had some redeeming value.<br /><br />The videos point to the book, and the book leaves you hanging.<br /><br />I came away feeling cheated.<br /><br />Let me say this, The book is not entirely useless.  Elementally, I believe in the concepts of the Happiness Advantage.  I feel it has valid precepts.  However what I disagree with is the delivery method of how they decided to package it.<br /><br />Sometimes excessive words to describe a concept is counter productive.  It felt like the cost of the book was determined by how many words it used and not by the quality of the message.
B008KE3960|5.0|well i thought this game was fun because i love tower defense games and this one iz diffrent  I think u should get this game
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Good story and appreciated the insight into the life of a person on the Seal Team. I didn't expect the author's slight digs regarding his political opinions, but do appreciate he has a right to his views. I appreciate the service to our country and it did satisfy the curiousity of how it all went down.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this game is fun but if u have the xbox or pc u know about caves and other stuff and 7 dollors is so not worth it dont get it unless there is a sale or something
B008OOYALE|3.0|I enjoyed playing but after days on end with no real changes I am losing interest.  I find the lack of decorations boring. the long wait for breeding is also tedious and no way to cancel an unwanted egg adds to the frustration.  I play several story games and find this too strongly dependent on real money being spent to get anywhere.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was great because as a brain surgeon with through knowledge of how the brain functions had a NDE.

If you have any doubts about God or Jesus read this.
1451638450|4.0|\\"Ivan, you idiot!\\" is the way that most of the other characters in the Vorkosigan series address Ivan Vorpatril, Miles Vorkosigan's cousin. Ivan isn't as sharp or as ambitious as his cousin Miles, but he isn't stupid. He's smart enough to realise that he's a potential claimant to the throne if anything happens to Emperor Gregor Vorbarra. On Barrayar, that makes him a magnet for plots: those who want to use him for their own ends, and those who want to prevent others from using him. He lacks enough wealth and power in his own right to protect himself, so he disguises himself as a non-entity: a Vor class playboy lacking ability and ambition.<br /><br />In previous Vorkosigan Saga novels, he's been absent or merely a bit player, a tall handsome Vor cousin to Miles, acting as comic relief and contrast to his brilliant cousin. He takes centre stage in this novel. Ivan's abhorred cousin Byerly Vorrutyer (previously appearing in A Civil Campaign IIRC) ropes Ivan into one of his plots. Shortly afterwards, Ivan is kidnapped by a pair of beautiful women and marries one of them, with the aid of a box of breakfast cereal, to prevent them both from getting arrested (trust me, it makes sense in the book). After that, things start to get complicated. The climax is a twist you will never see coming, but in retrospect makes perfect sense. It is at its heart a love story, and I found it a bit frustrating in parts, yelling \\"Just tell each other how you feel already!\\" at the screen (I read the Kindle edition). Not the strongest book in the series but still satisfying.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|The best sole type album that I have heard for ages.  The music is similar to Adelle, but darker and more moody.  I just cannot stop playing this on my ipod when walking to work everyday. Fantastic music, wonderful lyrics, a joy to listen too.  I can't wait to hear more of her work.  You will not ever regret buying this album.

B003ODIZL6|1.0|It was kind of tricky to really understand. You should really make it  easier to understand for the younger children to understand.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Wish I could give this series 6 stars. One of the best fantasy series I have read ever. In the world of fantasy literature where so many books are full of black and white it's incredibly refreshing to read something written for adults and full of shades of gray. This series made me a huge fan of Joe Abercrombie and I feel it's still his best work. I've enjoyed reading his other books as well but this series is really his best stuff.
1423140605|5.0|This book is a great addition to the Percy Jackson series. It's fun, suspenseful, and the familiar personalities are back. Bonus: Percy and Annabeth get some quality screen time, something the previous novels were lacking. It was great to finally get to see the Roman and Greek groups work together and interact. I read it and then handed it off to my students, who still haven't made it through the extensive waiting list. It makes me want to re-read the entire Percy saga, beginning with The Lightning Thief.
0156027321|4.0|Very vivid writing style-- made me feel the scenery through its precise descriptions, as though I was travelling with the protagonist. Because of that I applaud the author. On the other hand, because the imagery was so vivid, it made me feel suffocating (the whole idea of nothing but ocean around) but that's just my personal opinion. Overall it's enticing.

1935251740|5.0|Not being academic, I wondered how I would cope with this book, particularly because I only remember the fundamentals of classical physics from high school. I won't pretend to say I fully understand all the science in his book, however, he explains himself so well (with a wit unusual in a serious scientist)that I was able to get a grip on his work.  It is so utterly interesting and refreshing and of course as a respected scientist he has his reputation at stake. He certainly makes you think and re-think everything you thought you knew, and there is an honesty in his work. Of course, we are not in possession of all the answsers to the Universe and Mr Lanza does not pretend to have them all, but as Tim Freke would say, \\"The Mystery of it all is so exciting.\\"  Robert Lanza confirms this opinion.

0525478817|5.0|This is a brilliant new young adult fiction novel, narrated by a sixteen-year-old cancer patient named Hazel Grace Lancaster.  This novel gives the reader a look through the eyes of someone who is surrounded by the symbolism and metaphoric resonance of death and the day to day, minute to minute struggles of living with lungs that fail to function on their own.  In the novel Hazel is forced to attend a cancer survivor support group where she subsequently meets a young man named Augustus Waters who, once upon a one time, had previously been diagnosed with osteosarcoma and had a leg amputated as a side effect of treatment.  The two of them embark down a path of to discover insights to life, death, love, and friendship.<br />John Green puts a great deal of effort into the story to make you laugh and cry and it's not uncommon in any of his books to be found doing both simultaneously.  Green has a way of giving you just enough of exactly what you want hear in the story to keep you satisfied without giving you what you want.  He keeps you on the edge of your seat at every moment with even the format the pages and chapter follow.  In Looking for Alaska, each chapter begins with a number of days that are subsequently counting down to some sort of event or story climax.  It continues on like this, 127 days before, 98 days before, 72 days before and so on before too long when you are so built up from wanting to know what was coming since the beginning.  You know something is going to happen but how come the characters in the novel don't?  It's frustrating and exciting at the same time but it locks you in and keeps you reading the story, page by page, day by day.<br />The Fault in Our Stars is a great addition to the long list of amazing young adult fictions read in the world.  Alongside Green's own novels (Will Grayson Will Grayson, Paper Towns, Looking for Alaska, and An Abundance of Katherines), The Fault in Our Stars has made a place for itself next to other big names in the young adult fiction genre including The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky, which is hands down one of the best young adult fictions of this time, and the more recent Hunger Games.  The Fault in Our Stars has even made a lasting impression strong enough to contend with other more influential novels not of our time such as Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury and The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.<br />While I do compare Green's novel to others in a broad comparison or Green's fame alongside other names like Diana Wynne Jones and J.R.R. Tolkien, Green's writing is a contender of its own.  Green's characters are smart, pragmatic, quick witted, and have a great respect for knowledge.  Every novel he has written has some character that is beyond their years by how they are presented before any given situation whether it is solving the disappearance of a neighbor friend, understanding the reasons behind someone else's death, or reflecting on the unjustified correlation stereotyping eggs as being strictly a breakfast food.<br />Green's novel might be all these things and it may not be all these things to you as a reader, but one thing his novels will never not have is love.  He talks a great deal about love and its many splendors.  How it can surprise you and be somewhere you didn't expect, how love cannot be quantified or solved and that there is always some sort of leap involved.  My favorite quote from the Fault in Our Stars is in fact a quote about love narrated by Hazel Grace \\"I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, then all at once.\\"<br />The Fault in Our Stars is a wonderful novel and it is my belief that everyone should read it despite preference, ability, and maybe even library availability.  Novels such as this, are of the kinds that shape generations and steamroll prejudice, make changes to our world and build monuments in our lives.  Novels like this bring people closer together and help them feel something that maybe wasn't there before,or was small enough to remain unfelt or unacknowledged despite the feelings presence.  When I read a good book I fall in love with it.  That book becomes the only thing I can talk about for days or weeks or even years depending on its value to me.  The Fault in Our Stars was one of those novels for me and I hope that anyone else who has or has yet to read it feels the same way.  It's just as John Green wrote in An Abundance of Katherines, \\"Books are the ultimate Dumpees: put them down and they'll wait for you forever; pay attention to them and they always love you back.\\"

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Season 8 gets off to a terrific start.  I had a knee jerk reaction of feeling jipped at first in having the season start out with Dean's escape from Purgatory but the flashbacks were quick to come and very well done.  They immediately set the tone for just what kind of year Dean had. It was urgent, bloody and dangerous. Then we flash to Sam leaving behind a woman and a dog.  There are flashbacks for him as well only they are of a very different kind in comparison to Dean's.  I personally don't mind the whole time jump thing. Its an effective way to get the boys back together but still give us the history of their year apart.  The introduction of Benny was wonderful (and great casting) and I look forward to more of that particular back story emerging.  I'm betting there is more to Sam's year than what we've been shown and am willing to wait and let the writers unravel his story.<br /><br />There has been conflict between the brothers since the beginning when Sam wanted to return to Stanford, Jess and a normal life and Dean wanted nothing more than to continue the family business.  A LOT of stuff has happened in between but it seems they are coming full circle with Sam wanting out again and Dean a more dangerous and effective hunter than he's ever been.<br /><br />It's great to see Misha Collins back as Castiel and his fate in Purgatory has yet to be revealed.  I like the peek we've been given so far - Castiel leaving Dean to protect him, Dean refusing to leave without him.<br /><br />There is something unique about each season and I look forward to watching how this one unfolds and hopefully leads to another.
B002ZG9846|1.0|I just got my Blue Ray + DVD + Digital Copy in the mail today and discovered that Lionsgate is not being honest with their customers. Even though the Kick Ass digital package is still being sold and is advertised at a \\"Featured Title with Digital Copy\\" on Lionsgate's own website. They will not honor the codes and will not provide a digital copy. It appears that they have not been providing these copies since August of 2011.<br /><br />As much as I loved the movie (I would give the movie itself five stars)and await the sequel, I felt I needed to give this one star to let people know, they are wasting their money if they want to purchase this for the digital copy.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I DVR'd this for my husband and ended up watching it and thoroughly enjoying it myself.  I've never been a Sherlock Holmes fan (gasp!) but after watching Johnny Lee Miller in the pilot and the handful of episodes since I am very much enchanted with his neurotic portrayal.  Lucy Lu was a harder sell but she's growing on me.  Aiden Quinn's character is great and I like how he hangs back and lets Sherlock do his thing.  They compliment each other well and work well together.  This Sherlock is smart, quirky, funny but also seems oddly vulnerable and lonely.  The development of the friendship between Sherlock and Joan is slow and very well done.  Definately a good watch!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm sad to say I am done with the Hunger Games series. After a rocky start with the way the first one ended, I'm so glad I finished the series!! Kudos to the author for a job well done!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I found this book so interesting as it did not follow the usual plotting for a mystery novel.  In fact the writer was able to incorporate so much in this book as to why the disappearance of the protagonist occurred.  The author dug into martial love and hate, child rearing, police procedure, siblings relationships, community, and how people are easily fooled when the manipulator is beautiful and very smart.  Some reviewers did not like the ending.  I thought it was great and would make for a great discussion at a book club or with your friends.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|As a fan of the first three books, I was greatly looking forward to continuing the story.  Martin is fearless when it comes to his characters.  I would love to tell you more, but seriously, I don't want to deny you the shock of reading it yourself.  Let me simply say that when it comes to Martin's writing, nothing is safe.<br /><br />But now I think that his fearlessness has worked against him.  As Publishers Weekly put it, this book is not so much a continuation of the first three books, but is rather the start of a whole new era.  It might be better described as A Song of Ice and Fire Part Two: Book One.  The characters that we have grown close to are surprisingly not present.  The reason for this, according to Martin, is because the manuscript became so long for this book that he decided to split it into two books.  A Feast for Crows and Book Five: A Dance with Dragons occur simultaneously, but are split geographically.<br /><br />Still, this wouldn't have phased me if I had more interest in the characters present in this volume.  A Feast features the familiar point of view style that Martin has embraced, where each chapter is seen from the perspective of a different character.  In this book, we see the story from the eyes of Cersei Lannister, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime the Kingslayer, Samwell Tarly, Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, and a few others that we've never really heard from (Or can remember.  I can't wrap my head around all the characters in these books.  I mean, kudos to George for having such a large world filled with many inhabitants, but I can't keep my Tarlys straight from my Martells).  It comes down to a matter of personal taste, but these are my least favorite characters.<br /><br />Recommendation: First, the obvious.  If you haven't read the first three books, don't read this.  Read them first.  With that in mind, I say that if you enjoyed the beginning of the series, give this one a shot.  This will be the book that helps you decide whether or not to continue reading.  I chose to do so, and I have at this time finished A Dance with Dragons (a review of that will be coming soon).  I gave this one three stars.  Why three?  Three because I enjoy the series and want to continue reading it.  Not four or five though, because this book just wasn't as entertaining as the previous three.  While I understand that at this stage Martin is building groundwork for what comes next, I can't help but look back to A Game of Thrones.  In that book, which was the first in the series, there was no groundwork.  It was all groundwork, yet I couldn't get enough of it!  Perhaps the problem is that so much has happened, so much needs to be resolved, and the world has grown larger and larger, therefore making it extremely difficult to write a manuscript that isn't so large the reader couldn't lift it.

B008B11R1Q|4.0|As my title indicates, this album really grew on me. On first listen I was a bit disappointed, it's more sparse than the first album and the lyrics feel a bit weak in comparison to the first album, but the texture of the music has matured a bit and I love the club grooves Jamie xx has added to this. I think their self-titled is a better album, but I think that this is a good album as well worth a few listens before you judge it.<br /><br />A bit of advice, watch some live videos, it really put the music into a different perspective.<br /><br />Also, I would have preferred to give this a 3 1/2 star rating, but that's not possible.
B009FBX5M0|2.0|In the course of 007's 50 years in film, there have certainly been hits and misses in the scoring. When John Barry was at the helm, it was always a superb score. Barry defined the Bond sound. When others - like Marvin Hamlisch, Eric Serra, or Michael Kamen - had the reins, the results were poor. In 1997, Bond fans were treated to the work of David Arnold, who had scored such films as Stargate and Independence Day. Working in Barry's style and yet always ready to break fresh ground, between 1997 and 2008, Arnold's work always told you that you were listening to a James Bond score.<br /><br />A Bond score fan, I was worried when I heard Thomas Newman was taking over for this film. Newman is great, but how would he do at Bond music? When Adele's song was released, however, I was filled with a surge of wild optimism. The song was everything good about the Bond music. Sadly, when I received this score, my hopes were dashed.<br /><br />First, the Adele title song was not included - a major, major, major marketing mistake. But, with thirty tracks of music on the CD, we were sure to get some good James Bond music, right...? Um, no. The James Bond Theme is mostly buried... You should always know you are listening to a Bond score when you listen to it. In Casino Royale, the James Bond Theme was not let out of the box until the end, when your hair stands on end as Bond stands over White - but appropriately so, as it is the first \\"James Bond moment\\" with Daniel Craig. But the rest of the score had that \\"Bond sound\\" even without the primary theme. I mean, quite literally, Clint Mansell's score for Sahara (2005) sounds more like James Bond than this does!<br /><br />Worse, the Adele theme is almost nonexistent in the score. The album notes say it is in \\"Komodo Dragon\\", but I can hardly tell. This is a tremendous error, as weaving the title song(s) into the orchestral music has been a James Bond staple since 1963 and \\"From Russia With Love\\", and really ties the whole package together. Without strong themes, this score feels meandering and thoroughly aimless.<br /><br />The score also contains very little of the lush romanticism of John Barry or David Arnold (with the exception of a little in the Severine theme). While this score is decent as a standalone score for, say, a Bourne movie or some other film, it hardly sounds like a James Bond score and, as such, does not fit in the 007 catalogue... Certainly not on the genre's 50th anniversary.<br /><br />Very disappointing. Next time, David Arnold needs to make a triumphant return and fix the musical hash we have in this release. Or - and yes, I am being facitious - have Adele write the score, as she obviously knows what the Bond sound is more than Thomas Newman does.<br /><br />------- UPDATE -------<br />My initial review of the score still stands, but since writing it, I have seen the film. Despite the overwhelmingly positive critical reception and praise, and the incredible box office receipts the film is making, I was even more disappointed with the actual movie than the score. This was primarily because of its gaping plot holes and some startlingly out-of-character behavior by Bond.<br /><br />I do now see where the cues on the CD fit in to the overall framework, but I still don't like the way the score \\"works\\" in the film. Certainly much of this has to do with director Mendes' input and what he wanted, but the score just doesn't have enough of a James Bond feel - on the CD or in the film.<br /><br />To see if it's just me, I have now gone back and listened to a whole selection of Bond score CD's, including every one of the David Arnold entries. This score just doesn't hold a candle to the genre. I think some of it is the lack of an \\"echo\\" sound to the mix, as all the previous recordings had a rather \\"large-space\\" feel and this one was recorded in a different studio, but that is not all of it. Most of the action music just doesn't have enough of a strong, driving, brassy, big-orchestra sound (like \\"Exercise at Gibraltar\\" for The Living Daylights, \\"Miami Airport\\" for Casino Royale or \\"Time to Get Out\\" for Quantum of Solace, and so forth), and could have come from any modern spy flick.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there just isn't enough sweeping, romantic music (like \\"Bond Meets Tania\\" for From Russia With Love, \\"Mujahadin and Opium\\" for The Living Daylights, \\"Christmas in Turkey\\" for The World is Not Enough, \\"I'm the Money\\" or \\"City of Lovers\\" from Casino Royale, etc). I thought the trip up to Skyfall in the film, with all of that glorious scenery and some nice aerial footage, as well, would have made a terrific opportunity for some of the latter category; instead, it was too muted, too quiet, too non-Bond in feel.<br /><br />At any rate, I still feel that David Arnold needs to return with the classic Bond sound on the next film.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter(released June/12) stars Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln,Dominic Cooper as Henry Sturges, Lincoln's mentor,Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Mary Todd Lincoln,Anthony Mackie as William Johnson,Jimmi Simpson as Joshua Speed,Rufus Sewell as Adam,Marton Csokas(Borias in Xena)as Jack Barts,and others.I found the film to be a seamless blend of both the historical and fantasy genres of film.It takes a look at the life of Abraham Lincoln,from boyhood to his ascendancy to the Presidential office.It takes some of the more well known moments of his life and blends the raison d'etre of those moments with the fanatsy genre,in this case,vampirism.Walker does a wonderful job as Lincoln, as does the make up team as he ages.Now the whole premise of Vampires and Lincoln of course hinges on the ability of the film's makers to make you believe that there could have been an actual connection.If it doesn't the film fails.I found it succeeded brilliantly and therefore had me right from the start.<br />The story starts with Lincoln as a young boy.His father works for a harsh plantation owner(Jack Barts)who is whipping a black man(one of his slaves),then turns on the slaves son.Young Abe,much to his fathers chagrin,intervenes to help his friend Willi Johnson,then so does his father,who halts the lashing.The owner is none too pleased,but gets his revenge.One night the owner sneaks into the Lincoln homestead,and as young Abe watches,he bites his mothers arm.It seems Barts was a vampire.The mother gets terminally sick and passes away.Nine years later so does Abe's father,and Abe is now on a mission to get revenge.He is in a bar,drinking up enough courage to finally confront Barts.He doesn't do well and has to be rescued by one Henry Sturges.Sturges himself was bitten years before by the progenitor of the vampires,called Adam,and follows them to work against them.Sturges vows to help Lincoln in his quest for revenge and trains him for many years,with Lincoln's choice of weaponry;an axe.Lincoln eventually leaves his home and travels to Illinois where he gets a job in a store run by a Joshua Speed.It is also here he meets up with the future Mrs.Lincoln,Mary Todd and his old friend Willi Johnson,who will become Abe's most valuable and steadfast assistant.<br />Abe,after so many years,finally gets his chance at taking out Barts,and finally succeeds.Learning of Abe's activities,Adam kidnaps Willi and brings him to his plantation in New Orleans.This of course lures Abe to come to the rescue.This he does,but with the help of Mr.Speed.Time moves forward and Lincoln has successfully become a lawyer and starts running for political office.Eventually his ideas for the abolition of slavery takes him all the way to the White House.His mentor warns that if he continues his quest regarding slavery,which is the vampires greatest source of food,that he will be in deep trouble.The Fort Sumter incident comes and the Civil War is on.Adam has thrown his entire contingent of vampires into the fight against the North.The War is not going well for Lincoln and come Gettysburg,the entire outcome hangs in the balance.Lincoln instigates a drive in Washington to confiscate everything made of silver,so that it can be melted down into bullets,bayonets and cannon balls.<br />A train speeds south from Washington and Lincoln and Willi are aboard.Adam himself,along with a contingent of many other vampires,raids the train in an effort to stop it.It is all for naught,as the train is just a decoy and Adam himself is killed by Abe.The silver laden weapons arrive for the Northern troops(on another train),and,as history would have it,they defeat the South.The film comes to its close as Abe and Mary are taking a carriage ride to the Ford Theatre.<br />The film has some spectacular moments and two that stand out are the climactic confrontation on the train,and the other,the horse stampede scene culminating in Barts death.Tremendously done.Once the film pulls you into itscore premise,the actual historical moments do blend terrifically well with the vampire dynamic.Attention to historical detail is paramount in a film like this,and the makers deliver it in spades.From the period clothing to the look of Washington/the White House in the 1800s,it has it all.The inclusion of the Black plot line,also gives the film that much more credibility,from the inclusion of his lifelong friend Willi to the mention of slaves as food and its sparking of the war.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original w/s a/r of 2:40:1.The only extra is a featurette on the films making.<br />All in all a solidly acted and skilfully blended mixture of the historical and the fatastical;a famous president's unknown but plausible connection to vampires.Well done.4 solid stars..core premise,the actual historical moments do blend terrifically well with the vampire dynamic.Attention to historical detail is paramount in a film like this,and the makers deliver it in spades.From the period clothing to the look of Washington/the White House in the 1800s,it has it all.The inclusion of the Black plot line,also gives the film that much more credibility,from the inclusion of his lifelong friend Willi to the mention of slaves as food and its sparking of the war.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original w/s a/r of 2:40:1.The only extra is a featurette on the films making.<br />All in all a solidly acted and skilfully blended mixture of the historical and the fatastical;a famous president's unknown but plausible connection to vampires.Well done.4 solid stars..
B006VGGAC4|1.0|I just finished this book and I must say I had to force myself to get through it.  I have a thing....if I buy it...I finish it.  It was tough.  It was the most boring book I have ever read.  It is filled mainly with his Mr Universe training and the specifics on building these body areas...and how he should pose.  Boring.  Then he goes into every minute detail about his governor days his endless meetings etc........boring.  Who cares about all his meetings.  There is such a small amount about the real person, his feelings, family and regular life that I could hardly tolerate it.  Sorry I ever bought it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book captivated my interest from start to finish. Well written, smart, lots of twists and turns. A highly recommended read!
B000FC146C|5.0|I have read this book 4 or 5 times. It has a way of drawing you in and making you feel like you are a part of this story. Good times, bad times, joy, heartache, lust, love, respect
B005HSGB6W|5.0|A book that uses a language all it's own to be completely thought provoking, if for no other reasons then the face value of questioning free will.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love The Walking Dead! The show continues to impress with really strong characters and storyline, and surprisingly emotionally charged scenes.  Keep up the great work AMC!
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|great product  easy to use  best of all, availablity of tech help to answer questions easy to learn sharp clear pictures  availability of many books and movies
031618201X|4.0|Overall, this graphic novel stays very true to the book and is very pretty, but it is not perfect.<br /><br />The art could have used a better editor (patterns disappear, bracelets randomly appear than disappear, sizes are not consistent). And although everyone has a different mental image of the characters from the book, I feel the artist really missed the mark for Alexia. The point with Alexia was that she was not perfect and beautiful (at least as I remember it). I would have loved to see an artist draw a less-perfect character. Instead, Alexia is presented as a pretty lady with an overly generous bust and an hourglass figure. Hardly a unique or unflattering body type.<br /><br />As for the story, as others have mentioned a lot had to be cut from the written version (including some very useful explanations, such as what drones are), but I say enough of the story stays to make it enjoyable.<br /><br />All that being said, I will admit I read through it twice the first evening I had it (not only because I adore Lord Akeldama and Prof. Lyall) so I say it is an enjoyable and worthwhile purchase if you like graphic novels and you liked the book.
B009P13RQY|4.0|Apocryphon offers some of the best tracks Sword has ever created.  A few are weaker but still excellent rock music.  The live tracks don't have the best sound quality, and the performances aren't bad, but not remarkable.
B008OJ291W|3.0|Slightly entertaining and disappointing at the same time. It's like Leonardo da Vinci re-painting the Mona Lisa. By the way, the rest of review can also apply to Jeff Lynne's other new release Long Wave.<br /><br />As a life-long  Jeff Lynne/ELO fan, I sadly must say that I think Jeff is losing touch with his \\"sound\\". ... His layering has gotten to the point where it actually sounds one dimensional and boring. This album Mr. Blue Sky seems to merge his new production sound with the actual original tracks creating something slightly different but definitely not better. Fans new to ELO should buy the album Out of the Blue, in my book one of the greatest albums of all time and a work-of-art.<br /><br />Jeff's latest music and production now has a very dry, repetitive, and lacking-inspiration, sound to it. What's missing is his symphonic, reverberating, and ahead-of-it's-time sound that use to make his music fun to listen too.<br /><br />Sadly, It might be time for Jeff to retire. Possibly this album is one for his retirement fund. I would hate to see him go out this way. Maybe he can do one more... Maybe he can surround himself with other musicians (like Bev Bevan and Richard Tandy)... maybe an orchestra too... maybe he can focus on playing music instead of production perfection... just maybe he can pretend to be \\"back in 1981\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great series! Very original! The characters were interesting and the story moved at a good pace. I would recommend this series to all of my friends and family!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I'm a Grisham fan, but this one was weak and predictable by Grisham standards.  I kept thinking that I'd read it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Nice easy read.  Predictable, but in a Grisham sort of way.<br />And I was in the mood for a good guy to do what was necessary.<br />Don't expect an intellectual read and you won't be disappointed.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I understand why the author wrote this book in the manner that he did, but personally I would have liked to see more of the information concerning his medical condition.<br /><br />I have been following some NDE things for awhile, and almost all of them could be explained by possible dreams of the patient while going through this experience. This is the first time I have seen \\"proof\\" that a patient's brain was \\"offline\\" and not functioning during the time of the NDE. Therefore either we do not fully understand where dreams come from, or there is another plane of existence other than what we perceive normally.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great way to pass the time. I can't stop playing this game. Really fun way to waste time. Download and you won't be disappointed.
B0053O89KG|5.0|This show just keeps getting better. You would think it would start to die off after 4 years but its still so good.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I have been wanting to read this for some time now.  I actually got the chance when Colleen actually gave me a copy and I am so grateful.  This was a great book.  I read it within a day's time and rushed to start \\"Point of Retreat\\" which is the 2nd book.  I cried almost the whole way through this book because it hits the emotional cord big time.<br /><br />It's such a sweet story yet sad in many ways.  Lake and Will are such great characters and very relate-able in many ways.  They both had some really bad hardships but yet they find each other and know its something more than a mere acquaintance for them.  They need each other but something happens that keeps them apart and it's against their will.  Will they be able to be together and find true love? Or will it past them by?<br /><br />It's definitely a must read and I recommend everyone reads it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My very old, original USB cable covering for my Kindle just started crumbling away. I contacted Amazon and they very graciously replaced it with a new one free of charge. I can charge my Kindle with no worries now. Thank you Amazon. We need more companies like you! Pleasure doing business with you!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I enjoyed this one - though I admit to being a big fan of both the stars here.  Only saw a little bit of the original.
B00913DPW2|5.0|This game was two or three days of entertainment. I usually play less than an hour at a time. It was easy to pick up and continue the search for clues. The skip button was handy as some of the puzzles had me stumped. If you searched each scene you eventually found the clues. Looking forward to the next version.
B004ZY0VHY|2.0|This book had been brought up a few times for our choice, but we seemed to always choose something else. Finally, as it was still on the list, we decided to read it.  It was a very difficult read, not only because of its subject matter, but the overt wordiness, and use of very high level vocabulary, made it not easy to understand what was said.  The format, using personal letters, also made it difficult to \\"like\\" the book.  The author explained this at the conclusion, but I usually don't like to read either the reviews or the initial description of a book so I can draw my own conclusions.<br />There definately was a good discussion about the book, we agreed we would not like to see the movie, just a very difficult topic.  We could not identify with the mother, felt the son was pure evil, and the father clueless.  None of us could relate.  The comparision to other school shootings, and the depiction of how these shooters were identified, did not relate to Kevin, he came across as a true sociopath.  Even with the ending when he showed some fear, no remorse, could be viewed as manipulative on his part.  His mother, for whatever reason continued to visit him, so she must have been some sort of mashochist.<br />All in all, there are lots of good books out there, this would not be on my list of must reads.
B005HIBWFW|5.0|Have been trying to find video for years . not available in new zealand. The purchase was prompted ironically by a visit of The Russian Imperial Ballets performance of swan lake in Wellington NZ which I attended and which was great.<br />My biggest worry was that it would not play on NZ TV systems< which probably only applies to US VCR tapes>. It did.<br />Which gives me more confidence in ordering from amazon in the future
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well written story.  I enjoyed and appreciated the art of his story telling.  His credibility added validity to his position that Heaven does exist.  He challenged me to think about my belief in Heaven and God.  I have recommended it to many friends.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|Well, this is pretty much what we should expect at this point.  Aerosmith hasn't put out a fully rockin' album since the 80s, but they've never lost their knack for writing good, fun rockin' tunes, either.  This album falls in between Get a Grip and Nine Lives in the balladometer, with 40% of the tracks being a ballad - to me, this kind of detracts from a hard rock/metal album.  None of the ballads have really caught my ear yet, but 4 of them are OK - the last track is probably the slowest thing the band has ever done - maybe it'll grow on me, but so far it's a dud; and the country singing of Carrie Underwood rather detracts from the song she sings on.  The rockers don't rock as much as those on 9 Lives, but they're pretty good.  Overall, it's a pretty enjoyable Aerosmith album, and worth buying if you like the band's other later works.  A consideration for most older bands (especially those we haven't heard from) - Steven Tyler's voice has held up pretty well over the years. Note the Walmart edition contains a good, energetic cover song that helps counter the overballadization, while the special edition tracks (I was able to listen to on youtube) are: a pretty good non-ballad with bassist Tom Hamilton on vocals, a slow song with Joe Perry on vocals which didn't impress, and yet another ballad with Steven Tyler on vocals.  If it was a jewel case I'd probably have gotten the special edition, but as I hate the digipaks, I didn't feel I missed much by not getting these songs.<br />  All in all, though, I'm pretty excited that even 60% of the album is worthy Aerosmith - they've still got it when they're not ballading.  I mean, I was afraid before I bought this that Tyler's voice would be shot from age (it's been almost a decade since the last recording), or the band would totally have lost their ability to rock (let's face it, \\"Just Push Play\\" and \\"Honkin' on Bobo\\" were a little lackluster compared to earlier work).  And, the nice thing about the ipod generation is thatyou can put this on your ipod/mp3 player minus the ballads and have a pretty darn good Aerosmith that's just as long as the classic 70s albums (a technique I've found brings \\"Nine Lives\\" up in my estimation, too).
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A great Grisham; wonderful plot detail and suspense.  Lots of pieces of information to fit together and he does it so beautifully, so logically, and with great knowledge of the inner workings of racketeering and the FBI - at least, it appears so.<br /><br />I liked the complexity of the plot and the detail, however, the characters were not as fully rounded out as I could wish for.  I would have preferred more character information and less \\"what city are we in now?\\"  The suspense and plot build up certainly captured me. At one point, I really, really had to find out what happens at the end and peeked - big mistake.  Don't peek.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This wasn't a bad movie but I expected a little more out of it!! I wish it would have given us a little preview in the ending leading up to ALIEN going into Sigournney Weaver's character. Nice clear movie and well packaged!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book tries to flesh out too many characters and does not succeed very well.  It is long on character building and short on a moving plot.  Don't buy this book.  There are much better reads out there.
B00846REIS|5.0|Enjoyed this series so much! I am dying waiting for the 3rd book to come out! MUST READ if you enjoyed 50 shades!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This novel was better then bared to you. It was exotic as well as intriguing. I would definitely recommend it. I will also be pre-ordering the next cross file novel.
B009DP9D6A|4.0|I loves me some Deadmau5! If you like the other Deadmau5 albums then you will like this... Just crank it up.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this app is pretty good overall it just needs a square root sign because it is missing that but other then that its a good calculator
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a good app for all ages. I had my<br />Grandfather play it and he got to level 74 all by himself.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books.  This one, if not the best, is certainly one of the top two or three.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|This BBC cd is my favorite of all it ROCKS !!!!!!! Guitar is heavy.More keyboards and hard hitting drums and great vocals.The band sounds amazing. an amazing CD.A must have. you will love it.
1451696191|2.0|I don't understand what all of the fuss is about.  I thought this book was boring.  It was an easy and quick read so I finished it.  Otherwise, I would not have.  I guess I was expecting more based on the hype and the reviews.  I realize I am not the majority here and I don't really have anything negative to say about the book besides it just wasn't that great.  Decide for yourself.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I knew my kids would love this..but what i didn't know is how detailed and thought invoking this would actually be. I am loving it myself..when my kids were so excited about moving past certain levels, i had to see what the fuss was about..then when i got stuck on a level..i wouldnt stop until i passed it..Great Design Job to pull us in and have us waste more of our time on digital games..lol
B0031RS2HC|5.0|This is the first Lee Child book I have read.  He is an amazing writer and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I can't wait to read number 2 in the series
B005CRQ3LG|5.0|Lots of fun for a young reader. Technology, great visuals and appropriate language for 1st graders. My granddaughter loved using Grandma's kindle and was happy to show off her new reading skills.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such a good page turner! Couldn't put it down. The characters draw you in and have you worried for them.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a very good book that held your interest and kept you wondering. It had a good story line and always made you want to read more.It was very well written. I would read another Sylvia Day book for sure.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I liked the quality of the product and the speedy delivery. There were no surprises and I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to the music.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a good alarm clock. I like that you can use your own music and that you can choose specific days for each alarm.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series! I cannot wait to see what happens in the third book!! Can't get enough of Gideon and Eva!! Keep them coming Sylvia!!
B000B5OD4I|2.0|Just sent the watch back.  The \\"day\\" reading is bilingual (spanish/english).  Not something I want or need.  The display needs to be set on either language, but because the day reading must flip past the spanish it first shows the spanish day (at midnight) and then does not switch to the english day until about 3am.  This is not something that has any value for me and since I am often up past midnight its kind of useless.  Seiko was simply trying to save money by engineering one watch for two languages, but failed as the display is a clumsy attempt.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Prometheus tells a much bigger story and does it well, but it's missing what matters most. It's inorganic. A fascinating - and at times frustrating - film.
B006OFN0BQ|4.0|Hoover is not a man we know a lot about, but I think Eastwood does a great job of balancing what we do know with what makes sense. The movie was well acted and directed with a great trio of actors.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|It was OK.  I felt it was disjointed and the plot was pretty confusing.  It was just so-so.  Really wasn't her best effort.  Or perhaps I'm just tired to murder mysteries.
B007NQNRPO|4.0|It's been said so many times, and it's even describe thusly on the back of the Blu-ray. This movie is worth getting just to let your jaw drop and the beauty of Charlize Theron, she's gorgeous in this, and for the women... there's Depp to gawk at. They both deliver respectable performances. I had seen this years ago and had forgotten all about it, but having just seen Prometheus my Charlize crush has resurfaced and I remembered it. I did forget how it ended, and it's a bit of a surprise but not a spectacular twist. It looks good in HD and is worth adding to any Science Fiction collection for the price.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|it was represented as THREE short stories, but there were only TWO.  Felt short changed. The stories were great, good Michael Connelly.  Could be the beginnings of novels that failed to expand. Enjoyed none the less.
B009P13RQY|5.0|The Sword have returned with yet another riff blistering album.It seems to encompass all they have done up to this point, and I cannot remove it from my cd player.Whether you are a Sword fan or new to their music.....freaking get it no matter what.....nuff said....
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Nelson DeMille and I'm crazy about John Corey. I don't know exactly what it was, but I just wasn't as enthralled with The Panther, as I've been with other John Corey stories. It seemed to start off slow and took awhile for me to get into the story. John Corey was his typical wise guy self, which I've come to love, but he didn't make me laugh out loud as he has in the past. Perhaps the difference was I usually listen to the audio versions, which are superbly narrated by Scott Brick. I don't know, maybe it was me, perhaps I'm the one that was off.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|An excellent choice for a book club, church book study, or gift.  I plan to share this with many!  Touching and sincere.  Good use of the scientific without making it impossible to read.  Highly recommend!
0439023513|3.0|I kind of expected more out of this book.  The first two were just so good, and the author could have done a lot more.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|i love this app! i have no problems falling asleep. you dont have to worry about falling asleep because it has a timer!
030758836X|5.0|Loved this book from page one.  I read the first chapter over lunch one day and honestly didn't want to get back to work (but I did).  This book combines great writing with psychological twists and turns that keeps the reader on his/her toes. Amy and Nick are both nut jobs...or are they?  The ending left me in total shock.  You will have to read it to see what I mean.  You won't be disappointed.
0451191153|3.0|An entertaining novel but I have a problem with the vision propounded.I had read this 15 years ago as a young man straight out of college and it had made an impact on me. Now with the wisdom of passing years I thought to catch up by reading this again. And what a difference. The selfish vision propounded in this work has no place in our society. While it is fine to take the high road in a novel and say its my way or the highway , that is not how it works in real life. I am not saying that one should compromise with mediocrity it is indeed possible to excel in your chosen field without being obnoxious.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great ap. Works perfectly on my fire. Easy to play. Great way to relax and unwind. It's free! Nothing to lose.
B005FUJNNU|4.0|What more can be said about this DVD ? It's Johnny Depp in Alice In Wonderland in blue ray 3d. Very entertaining The DVD arrived as scheduled in perfect condition and viewing quality on the screen is very good.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved this book. You get to know more about Annabeth  in this installment of the series. I can't wait for the next book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have enjoyed all of his books and this is another winner! I read it in one sitting.  A must read
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The Fifty Shades trilogy seems like an X-rated romance novel. So far very predictable yet I am somehow compelled to keep reading...not because the writing is fabulous but because I keep waiting to be surprised.
B002ZG997C|4.0|Fabulous movie. Dark and graphic, but a very unique storyline with an unexpected twist. It requires a second viewing to grasp the underlying theme.
B0092C2X7U|2.0|This was a good game at first. The first level has like 7-8 flips, and I still have yet to beat it. The main problem is that it freezes my phone up every single time I play it. Until this is fixed, it is going to stay un installed on my phone.
B008U0FJF8|5.0|After the first two or three listens to this record, I was not impressed. Lo and behold, after a few more listens, I am absolutely LOVING this record. It will grow on you, just give it time. Subtle elegance.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Fifty Shades is basically soft porn with a decent (although somewhat outrageous) heterosexual story line.  This combination is enough to keep the women reading and wanting more; however, I tried reading it with my husband and it did absolutely nothing for him.  If you like erotica with a little substance, then you'll enjoy this book.  Stay away if pornography is not your thing.
B009JNXK88|5.0|just what the title says.  this a fun retro style platformer that will keep you entertained for spans of time.  i find it great to play this while waiting on things.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|This was a good but not great book.  I had hopes for a brighter story, but the old King darkness peeped through.  Still a good read!
B0083GPDBO|2.0|This movie was not what it was hyped up to be.  The trailer was the best about the movie. It was a let down!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I love reading Nelson DeMille and pre-ordered The Panther.  I wasn't disappointed.  Unlike others I enjoyed the detail regarding Yemen and the Yemeni's.  Different cultures have always interested me and DeMille is an excellent researcher of both culture and geography.  And, as usual, John Corey maintains his wry humor.  I often found myself laughing at an intense moment in the story.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|This could have been so bad like so many fantasy adaptations. Instead it was an epic piece of masterful filmmaking that will be watched and loved for decades to come.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I purchased this app a few weeks ago and it works just fine ,I have had  no problems at all.It really doesn't need to do much except analyze the signal and it does exactly that without fail.I would recommend this to anyone looking to find the strongest signal no matter where you are located.
B00406TRU4|5.0|Excellent series!  Early to bed am I so I missed out on this great series, no more though!  I've got all the season's including the pre-order for season 4.  Thanks Amazon!
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I don't really like Tom Cruise as a person, But I always have to marvel at his acting ability. The monkey was the best part though and who Russel Brand could sing!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was really disappointed in this book.  It was one of the worst books I have ever read.  The main event happens right off the bat.  Then most of the book is just getting to know the people.  There is no happy ending, and the main event becomes moot at the end.  I didn't see a story being told.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Easily a top-ten choice among all the game apps I have ever played. I still play it on my iPhone and now on my Kindle Fire (finally!) :-)<br />Have had it on my phone for years - re-playability is long-lived, for me at least. The ads are unobtrusive, and I rarely hit them accidentally. Hey, it's free, too!
B00843TZJ2|2.0|I love these guys, one of my favourite groups of all time, but this cd is for hardcore fans only. Please don't let this be the first time your kids or grandkids hear these guys.  I saw them in concert two years ago, and they were great, but my wife and I both commented on how weak their voices and harmonies were getting. Seeing them live and being wrapped up in the concert atmosphere it was fun, but listening to this cd would be painful for anyone who doesn't love them.<br />At first I rated this cd OK, but I had to change it to two stars because I would not want to mislead anyone into purchasing it. There are great albums out there. CSN and DejaVu are classics.  If you want live \\"Four Way Street\\".<br />The redeeming value for me is hear Suite Judy Blue Eyes, when we saw them in concert we couldn't believe it when they didn't do it.<br />CSN and CSN&Y will be part of my music collection forever, I just probably won't play this one when anyone else is around.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful. Extremely well written. An amazing story and plot. A must-read for everyone. It is one of the few books that has brought me to tears.

B003N7ORNI|4.0|A good read. With a brother and sister adventuring through Egyptian mythology it was entertaining and exciting. But don't read this too soon after reading The Lightning Thief series, as the similarities will have you wondering where are the Greek Gods.
0066620996|5.0|There is a reason this book is so successful. It is a must read. The concepts in Good to Great can be applied to any business in any industry. I always tell others that they are inches from greatness, and that is certainly evident in this book. I use many of these concepts in my own businesses.  One of the reoccurring themes is that great vision without great people is irrelevant. The best leaders are humble and attribute their success to those on their team. Clearly great vision and great people is a recipe for great success. I highly recommend this book to all executives, entrepreneurs, and visionaries. It's a rewarding  read.
0066620996|1.0|Jim Collins needs to STOP writing books and sit on a beach. Good to Great, colossal old school thinking, diatribe and now PROVEN debunk information and author who is trying to score a book from 1950-1985 thinking.<br /><br />Old dog, no new tricks.<br /><br />Oh and the retraction book as to why 90% of the CRAP \\"advice\\" in this book just goes to spin off the useless door stop this tree killing/waste of time book really is.<br /><br />900+ reviews and 4+ stars?  All from SHEEP that read it BEFORE 2008.  Would love to see their \\"amended\\" reviews.

B0014JKJK2|1.0|OK--now I hate them. I left them on the back porch over the weekend, and come Monday they were ruined. The sun evidently heated them and shrunk them 2 or 3 sizes. Amazon won't take them back (it's evidently been too long - like 5 months) but they are shot.<br /><br />I won't buy crocs again, and would give them zero stars if I could. Buy Waldies - they're better. Even the K=mart knockoffs wouldn't be worse, and at least cheaper.<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />I've worn Waldies (the original 'Crocs') for lots of years, and although I might get funny looks in Southern Utah, I find them very comfortable for most things. I'd rather go barefoot, but that's not always a good choice, and the Crocs sole is great for standing or working on a hard surface. Walking is fine - they have a two-part sole, with a non-skid non-marking tread attached to the bottom of the shoe, which gives them a more substantial feel. I occasionally hike in them, and although I prefer my Chacos, the Crocs are fine for short trips.<br /><br />Generally they are more comfortable with socks when worn for extended periods. They get a little clammy without socks.<br /><br />But. The best thing is that they are very east to put on and take off. It makes them ideal for garden shoes or trips from the porch to wherever. If you travel by car and enjoy taking your shoes off in the car, these are the easiest to wear.<br /><br />As with any clog-style shoe, fit is important. It's nice to have them roomy enough that you can step into them without having to bend over or stand on one foot. But they need to fit tight enough that they don't slop all about on your feet. The Crocs seem to be generously large. I had to re-order them a size smaller than I usually wear, to get the proper fit. It's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of five.<br /><br />And, of course, washing them is easy and drying them is easier.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A fasinating account of his experience. Believable on all levels. One does not make up this narrative that he has so beautifully written. I encourage others to read this amazing story.

B004KA9VGA|5.0|I was told by a friend that this book was good and I finally read it, it was so good, I could not put it down. There are no boring bits like most books have in them. I have read 50% of the second book and am loving it just as much. I will be sad when I get to the end and have to wait for the third book to be published.
1609611543|3.0|Book / cookbook have recipes for cooking in the microwave.  Why go to all the trouble of changing diet, buying healthy food then destroying it in the microwave?  Makes no sense to me.  Looses credibility from that perspective alone.  Avoid the microwave - better yet, get rid of the microwave!
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|We have enjoyed the 24 series.  We have all the seasons and go back to watch them over.  We start out to watch one episode and wind up watching up to 4 in an evening.  Highly recommend 24 to everyone who likes action.  Recommend that you begin with season one and work your way up.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|I was stuck in the Airport, this was a best seller I figured I would give it a try, awful IMO
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It was a fairly mundane read with a few surprises..overall it was enjoyable.I felt it could have been less of a sci fi type narrative.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book held my interest because I was expecting a big surprise finish, but nothing. The story just stopped. I am assuming there will be a sequel which in my opinion is how many authors and publishers are doubling their profits.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Grisham's latest book.  Some quibble about the plot being hard to believe and maybe I'm getting old and cynical but I had no trouble believing it could happen.  I loved the fast pace; Couldn't put it down.  It brought to mind some of his better books like The Firm or The Broker.  For me his books are sometimes a little too dark or don't end well but that is not the case with The Racketeer.
B000OV85AW|5.0|Awesome Movie. A real classic. McQueen and Hoffman are a spectacular combo. Timeless masterpiece. I watch this movie once a year, to remind me never to be locked-up!
B004EBT6HE|3.0|I love Ken Follett but this book just did not catch my interest. I did not like the main character or any of his compatriots. The whole premise is silly. I normally dont walk away from a book but I did with this one. I will probably go back to it at some point but not now. If I dont like the main players in a book I cant get involved in the story because I just dont care what happens to anyone and that is what happened here.
B000HVHM5S|5.0|This movie manages to be both visually spectacular and a good thinker. Many of the issues in the movie are over exaggerated versions of things we see going on today. However, despite the deep thought component of this film, it is equally entertaining for one who just enjoys a good action flick and some explosions. Highly recommended to those who like good movies.
0385535147|2.0|No drama, no tension and resolution, nothing to hold interest.  The hero's plans all work out just as he hoped, nothing goes wrong, everything's good in the end.  Boring.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the book and I encourege u to read it. This book is the most overwhelming of the series.I hope Suzanne Collins waited more hunger games books and makes it better tan the Harry potter series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its a good SIMPLE calculator, so if your looking for a scientific one don't download it and give it a bad review. but if your looking for an average every day calculator, then u should download this.
0345531965|3.0|This book has two distinct personalities:  one is a well written, fascinating account of traveling down a river far from civilization to find someone a la Heart of Darkness.  However, the second is a tedious, stereotypical account of greedy, badly behaved heirs with greedy, badly behaved lawyers who are contesting a will.  I was captivated by the former and bored by the latter.  Definitely a mixed bag.  The end was also strangely unsatisfying.  I wish it had been consistently good!
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|too hard to control. to be honest, I'm not very good at this game, therefore, I dislike it. so u can download it if you want to, maybe you'll like it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As age catches up with me, I am seriously interested in the concept of Heaven. Both my Dad and Mom died in recent years and my husband's Dad and Mom died a few years before. I witnessed/experienced all of those events. And some of those experiences included extraordinary events that are totally unexplainable to those of us who have not experienced death or near death. 'Proof of Heaven' provides documentation that supports my experiences.
B005HSL626|5.0|its a great time killer and it is one of my favorite games!! I recommend that u download this if your bored.

B0031YJFCQ|3.0|Stieg Larsson created a wonderful set of characters and circumstances that could have been located anywhere in the world.  But choosing Sweden and their steadfast defense of freedoms and civil rights allows the readers to get an unvarnished peek at how even the most progressive countries can screw up.  The detailed journey of Lisbeth is one of the best fictional trilogies I have ever read, and even though I do not grade this book as highly as the first two, it is an essential read for Larsson fans.  The wrap of of the entire story, the justice served and the final reconciliation are worth the minor complaints one might find in this final book.  It is very sad that we are not able to continue with the characters and how their lives might have evolved after this story ended.  Thanks Stieg, a great set of books.
0156030306|4.0|The book I purchased was a used book, however it was in excellent condition.. it was a gift for a friend so I was a little skeptical about getting a used book, I read this on a Kindle and my friend does not have one; I was very much surprised with the results.  It was delivered in a timely matter...and was extremely less expensive then the new book.I hope that future purchases will have the same results.
B0092C2X7U|2.0|This game will suddenly quit working and make my HTC EVO 4G LTE reset. This is very disappointing. If it didn't make my phone crash it would be a great app.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so adictive i love it and i play it every day i honestly recomennd  you to buy it so please do so
B008NAFU9A|5.0|I bought this to read with my daughter as she absolutely loves paranormal fantasy and romance books and I like to find books that we can both get into and enjoy together.  This has been our favorite in the genre since the Twilight series came out!  Ophelia is a great female lead and her character is so strong (creepy but strong!).  I am always looking for books with a strong female lead in them and this was one of the best.  I loved the romance that developed and even though this is a short novel it really drew me in.  My daughter loved the way that Ethan was written... such a stoic hero.  My only real issue with the story was that it was over too fast... although we will definitely be buying the next book in the series!

0452273331|3.0|Review by Jack Trammell<br /><br />The Fountainhead is a brilliant novel, written by a brilliant thinker--but it has been greatly abused in the name of so-called Objectivism and in terms of Capitalism and Christianity.  While Howard Roark stands sublime and triumphant at the metaphorical pinnacle of modernism and individualism (at the top of his own architectural masterpiece, a skyscraper of steel rising above the ordinariness of the city below), his now obedient wife at his side (Dominique), and his enemies humbled (Gail Wynand) or banished (Ellsworth Toohey), the novel none-the-less ends with the central issues of modernity and of morality completely unresolved in terms of plot.<br /><br />This novel, taken as a whole and as philosophy, is in reality nothing less than a scathing indictment of Capitalism and of modernity, and antagonistic to the most basic tenants of Christianity.  Roark may indeed be a literary hero (and his counterpart, Peter Keeting, a literary goat), but in terms of realpolitik Roark represents selfishness, arrogance, and utter disdain for man as a social creature.  To quote one reviewer of the book, \\"it is better read when one is young enough to miss the point,\\" and the point according to the overarching storyline is that any individual man does not need any other man (or woman).  All of the characters, including Roark, engage in a Capitalist orgy of the self, recognizing no profit but that which pads the economy of their own egos.<br /><br />From an Anarcho-Syndicalist perspective, The Fountainhead represents a kind of postmodern self-obsession, a fairy tale trip into the delusion that anything we do is disconnected from other people, or somehow does not build upon the work (and ideas) of others.  It is actually a stark warning of what happens if you take the philosophy underlying  Capitalism and a totally free market economic system to its ultimate logical, supposedly amoral conclusion--a conclusion that assumes concepts like tangible socialprogress, the beneficence of economic Darwinism, and the complete realization and perfection of self.<br /><br />Even Rand's intentionally collectivist character, Toohey, amounts to nothing more than a self-centered, power hungry, deluded intellectual trapped inside his own notions of progress.  His altruism amounts to the benevolence of the dictator who seeks power only as a means to self-actualization.<br /><br />The basic tenants of Christianity are to love one another, to share resources (the fish and loaves), and to value the individual within the collective (as demonstrated complexly in the disciples' argument over who was the greatest among them).  There is not a character in Rand's story that comes remotely close to those ideals, nor one who uses his profits, be they monetary or intellectual, to further the collective health of his fellow men and women (and Toohey, least of them).<br /><br />The Fountainhead represents nihilism, greed and callousness; the very aspects of Capitalism that constantly call its moral foundation into question.<br /><br />###
B0091REZMW|4.0|Progress is slow but overall a good game. I do wish energy generated faster but hey....it is what it is.
1934030597|5.0|great book. Easy to follow diagrams. I feel like I can do anything with this book..... I have some natural mechanical ability too which I think helps.
B006VRLNV6|5.0|I consider myself a stickler for audio quality, and I find this 40th anniversary remastered special version of the Doors L.A. Woman album in MP3 format to be superior to the CD I bought back in the 90s. The vocals have great depth and the instruments are more distinct and clearer than ever. Whoever engineered this remaster did a fabulous job bringing out the subtleties while remaining true to the original.<br /><br />Many consider this to be the Door's masterpiece album. It may be, but I think there are others just as inventive, creative and musically stimulating. What really sets this apart is the second disc's worth of alternate tracks and B-sides. L.A. Woman is particularly fun but all of these \\"new\\" tracks inject new life into this already dynamic recording. Doors aficionados should get this if only for the remastering quality and these added tracks. Those new to the Doors may want to start off with earlier albums, but this 40th Anniversary edition should be on their shopping short-list if they find that they like this band. This is classic Doors, and deserves to be your collection. You won't be disappointed, especially at the price Amazon is selling it at as of this writing. To complete this collection, consider also getting the last two tracks from [[ASIN:B00122PV3Q L.A. Woman [40th Anniversary Mixes]]], Orange County Suite and (You Need Meat) Don't Go No Further.<br /><br />Enjoy -- this is Morrison and the Doors at the wane of their peak together. There's magic here.<br /><br />~ Kort
B007EECSFA|5.0|The Secret Keeper is a good read. A little mystery, and a little romance, makes you thankful that we do not experience air raids. Quite entertaining with a great twist!
B003Y3UNZW|4.0|No cussing, thank goodness my girls don't understand some of the lyrics.  Love the song Peacock, but definitely don't like my kids listening to it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have enjoyed this game and it has quickly become the first I check. The graphics are great and the dragons downright adorable. My main complaint is the many notices that pop up when you start the game. I suppose the number varies, but for several days I would have 5 or 6 notices pop up upon loading telling me about limited edition dragons, asking me to rate the game, notifying me of gifts, and quests. It is a small price to pay. I also dislike the cost of clearing foliage, but it appears you earn money quickly if you are willing to check in often. 5 minute visits frequently can net you a lot, but increases how annoying the notices are. I definitely support this game. so far my favorite of the teamlava games and I play Restaurant Story, Fashion Story, and Bakery Story.
0385535147|3.0|Very easy reading , the chapters are very short and the english is basic.<br />The story line was okay but the plot was too easy to figure out.<br />Not a bad book for the beach or a short rainy afternoon

B0065GC0BA|4.0|Despite the very sad theme of this book, ( l cried a lot at the ending )and this was so even though l had guessed the outcome, l did enjoy this book. The characters were well drawn and l felt completely involved with their story. l hadn't read JoJo Notes before but will certainly try other books by her.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I purchased Proof of Heaven last Saturday online from Amazon, and read it on my PC Kindle.  The topic is a favorite of mine, and from the start I was looking forward to the experience of a scientist on a spiritual plane.  I was not disappointed.  In fact, I finished the book in one day.  That's right, I started reading in the morning, and before I could lay my head down to rest I had finished.  Just couldn't put it down.  Thanks for a wonderful perspective and a delightful journey, and thanks for adding some scientific support to matters of faith.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is fun when you are just sitting around and need something to do.  I will not buy more coins.  I don't like the fact you have to wait several hours to play again after you have used all of your coins.  Otherwise it is fun.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Based on the first four episodes shown so far, this season looks to be at least as good as, if not better than, the first one. The prison setting of our main group of characters feels so claustrophobic, dangerous and dreadful, you can almost smell the corpses of all those dead walkers as our heroes venture into those yards and dark corridors. New characters introduced (Michonne, The Governor) and the \\"community\\" they live in are intriguing and you can feel the tension rising already. The action and acting have both been superb. Little Carl has become a ruthless killer in a hurry. Episode 4 must have been the best single episode of the series yet, without giving anything away it was so gut wrenching and heart breaking. Can't wait to see what happens next! For my taste this is the best TV drama to come around since The Sopranos.
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|I gave it one star because it was a poorly writen predictable storyline.  It was so bad I can't believe I read the whole book......I couldn't wait for it to end!
B005XN31LY|4.0|Loved it! Great idea interspersing fairy tale setting with modern times. Some great and memorable characters. A few episodes miss the mark, but entertaining overall.
B008OJ291W|5.0|The recordings on this collection are astounding aurally. Check it out with headphones. I have listened back and forth with the original tracks against the new tracks and it is great fun. First of all, Lynne has always been a great producer, but he is better now than he was earlier. The new recordings are cleaner and crisper. The arrangements as suggested in the original recordings are nailed solid in the new recordings. The sound is very full. Vocally, Lynne's voice may (miraculously) be better now. His phrasing sounds exactly as I remembered the originals but when you compare you find the new vocals actually nail the phrasing that was previously only suggested.<br /><br />Other interesting changes: the backup female vocals on songs like \\"Living Thing\\" have so much more \\"character.\\" The \\"band\\" sounds tighter on the new tracks: Listen to the intro to Mr. Blue: the old version has more space between the staccato piano part and the handclaps, the new version has them closer together and they are no longer handclaps, rather some other percussion, then the snare roll, again way cleaner, then the big cymbal crash--in the old version it is muddy and fades quickly, in the new version the first cymbal crash is bright and rings for almost 4 bars as it slowly fades away.<br /><br />Every single part has been recreated and in most cases has been done slightly better, crisper, tighter and recorded with more fidelity. The old versions, of course, used real strings and horns which always sounds better than synthesizers, although the new synthesized parts are done really well--but you can quibble there.<br /><br />The funny part is that if you just listen to it in the background on your car stereo, it's going to sound exactly the same--same old ELO. However -- if you got ears -- and wanna have some fun, you can get some good headphones and flip back and forth deconstructing these toons. I can't imagine enjoying this treatment with any of the other bands I love--imagine if Paul McCartney redid Sgt Pepper by himself: God!! No!!!--but somehow Lynne pulls it off here.

B007SGLZP8|2.0|I found tis book far less well written in comparison with his previous novels. ( I am half way through) There is not much excitement or tension, it sort of hobbles on on the same pace.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|An excellent book with very detailed intrigue....John Grisham wrote a complex but thrilling story with a surprise ending.  One of his better novels.

B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a great little tool for the Wi-Fi network specialist, but even a lay user will find it extremely useful to know the strength of Wi-Fi signals throughout the house. The graph view is especially useful, all the SSIDs show up in a graph of signal strength versus channel number. At a glance you get all the information you need to know what is going on with your access points, routers, repeaters, etc. The best thing is it shows each Wi-Fi device separately even if they have the same SSID.<br /><br />Since it is free, it is a no-brainer. Get it and never have to guess why your Wi-Fi is not working. If you are at a new place (airport, cafe, whatever), just fire it up and check out which is the best Wi-Fi to connect.
0345803485|5.0|I love it and i have recommended to friends actually a friend recommended it to me and i am spreading the word fixing to now order the other 2. will not regret the buy.
B000LB7G00|1.0|I bought it as I am doing 3d modelling on a mac. Unfortunately none of drivers for the latest autodesk (Maya etc) products work. I have spent hours trying to get it to work and have had numerous crashes using their latest beta drivers (version 10) when trying to create a macro. Leaves a lot to be desired. On a mac it only seems to work ok with Google Earth. 3dconnexion (i.e. logitech) needs to beef up its mac game. Disappointed. If you're a mac user use the apple trackpad as I have discovered actually works extremely well for 3d navigation.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love my case! My kindle is well protected even in my overloaded purse.  The color is a beautiful vibrant red and the stand is adjustable so I can type, surf the web and read at the perfect angles.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Let me first start this review with saying, I have been reading nothing but trashy novels for the past 4 months.  So, I decided I needed a change.  I kept seeing Gone Girl at the top of the best seller list and thought... I could get down with that. The book is told from two perspectives, Nick the husband and Amy the disappearing wife.  The first part of the book flip flops from Nick's present thoughts and Amy's past journal entries, which I really liked.  The book took a lot a turns and kept me guessing.  There were times where I thought I knew what was going on, but then I thought, wait is this just what the author WANTS me to think? I've read a lot of people complain about some of the outlandish scenarios that take place, that stuff didn't bother me.  It's a fiction novel, not an autobiography.  PUT ON YOUR IMAGINATION CAPS, PEOPLE!  Anyway, all that said the book was good up to the end.  I almost threw my kindle across my room.  I was like, \\"WTF?!\\"  I felt like we had this great story and then no resolution.  I think this would be a better movie than it was a book. That being said, I still think it's worth a read...maybe just wait till it's on the 3.99 and under list.

If you want to wast your time and money buy this app. All of you people who like this app seresly need to start seeing the oviouse. Allthough this game is terrible it has a good price.If your parents said 'you get a chose of Angry Birds Space or Angry Birds Seasons ' chose seasons.
B0055SWM08|4.0|nice, relaxing puzzles. well desiged. a nice alternative to frantic, time based games. has a friendly feel to the gameplay
B007N85POS|4.0|Angry Birds is the kind of game I can just sit and relax and not exert too much effort in playing it. As I've learned to love playing it, I've also learned to use the power of the birds strategicaly just so I could get 3 stars. The only problem I have is when I played it on my Kindle, it behaved improperly. It will get stuck at some point till I have to uninstall and reinstall which results in losing my stats and starting all over again. I'm getting tired of this problem. I've bought all other Angry Birds on my Iphone (didn't have a problem with that)... So maybe, it's the Kindle itself. I hope Amazon have a fix on this.<br />Overall, I love the game!

Well written, well acted, wardrobe, makeup hairstyles and set design are all very true to the time period. There is nothing cheap about this show. It never insults my intellect.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is incredibly timely considering the Benghazi murders.  this book is even more amazing than De Milles others. He works so closely with people who have experienced the events he is portraying. This is shocking, revealing, terrifying, and true to form humorous. Humor is a byproduct of people operating in life threatening situations and DeMille never lets us down. You can't put it down. An up close and personal look into middle eastern life and attitudes.
B00884GR0W|3.0|the game is fun not minecraft but fun and has a story... the problem is it has some glitch that makes it automatically exit on my kindle fire! it is very irritating because you lose what ever is not saved... please fix soon so this game can be at its full potential!!!
B005LLT0DQ|5.0|I am completely addicted to SOA, and it has become one of my all time favorite shows. This season I enjoyed watching the changes in the characters, post incarceration.  There were some plot twists I didn't see coming, and that's something of a treat, with TV as it is nowadays.  For me, the season finale was one of the most powerful I'd seen.  It was subtle but left me thinking of possible futures for the club long after the episode had ended.  I would give this season 10 stars if I could.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is the third book  in the series.  I read book two and now am reading book 3.  This book is awesome.  A great fantasy that continues well off from book 2.  60% through and don't want this to end.
0525953728|5.0|This was an incredible book to read. The courage and dedication of the silent heros who protect and defend our country is amazing.  My husband was a drafted Green Beret Special Forces Sgt. and Team Leader in Viet Nam, highly decorated with the Airborne Division. General Westmoreland was his commanding officer.  So, these Seals act of  pure unselfish bravery is and should be written about often
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I found this book to be interesting and unique.  The story is about a boy who believes that he and his family are utterly normal.  But, of course this is not the case and he begins a journey that changes his life.  There are a lot of supernatural events and characters.  The author ties the story to a bunch of antique photographs, which add a nice touch and lend credibility to the characters.  I kind of lost interest towards the end but still enjoyed the book overall.

B009A9EPLM|4.0|After my first listen, I was both moved and disappointed by this score. As an avid Williams fan, I have impossible expectations for America's greatest composer. Each and every time, I expect Williams to create a score that will become entrenched into the annals of great movie soundtracks. He has shown time again he is capable of doing so. That being said, this score is average for Williams. He goes through all of the motions and creates a beautiful score, but its nothing we haven't heard before albeit with a new permutation. William's days of experimenting with new techniques and sounds are over and I have been critical of him as of late.<br /><br />Between his recent War Horse and Tintin soundtracks, Lincoln is the best. He establishes a signature theme and plays with it effortlessly. I was privileged with being able to see an early screening of the movie and the soundtrack is almost exclusively played softly for a subdued background effect. Unlike the Patriot, which I consider this score to be most similar to, the score is not the focal point. The most powerful moments of the film are times when there is no score being played at all.<br /><br />The main theme is really only played in the ending credits thus making this soundtrack almost better as a stand alone listen. Overall, I was moved by the score and it truly demonstrates the work of a god amongst men, yet it falls short of my admittedly lofty expectations.
0345803485|1.0|It makes sense that this started out as \\"Twilight\\" fanfiction, it's written like fanfiction.  First of all, if you're going to fanfic any writing, at least let it be good writing!  Stephanie Meyer, the author of Twilight, at least had the excuse of writing for teenagers to defend the fact that she wrote like a teenager; there's no excuse for James' incredibly poor writing for adults.  Even beyond the inexcusable lack of author skills and editor management, this book is a train wreck.  It's the story of a ridiculously naive and vulnerable young virgin being taken advantage of by a controlling, exploitative, manipulative millionaire (or billionaire?) who happens to be unbelievably good-looking and is inexplicably obsessed with the main character for absolutely no reason whatsoever.  Other than the fact that I'm offended on so many levels as a woman, for so many reasons, I don't understand why ANYONE likes it, even if you don't mind being with a guy who beats you for his own sexual pleasure and coerces you into signing an agreement saying it was all consensual.  Some people like it because it's erotica, I guess. I love a good sex scene as much as the next person, and the more explicit the better I say.  I hate when you're reading a book and you really want the main characters to do it, then when they do and they're done you just wish they'd do it again.  I never thought there could be anything bad about having too many sex scenes in a book until I read Fifty Shades and realized how boring and repetitive it is.  I mean think about sex in general, not just in books, it's awesome the first couple times you're with someone, but after doing the same thing for so long it just gets mind-numbing and you start making grocery lists in your head during the act.  That's what happens in Fifty Shades, you're just waiting for the sex scenes to end to see if the story develops further.  It doesn't.  Boring, insipid and incredibly unrealistic and unbelievable there's nothing likable about this book.  This is the first series I have ever started and not finished because I couldn't force myself to read past the end of the first book.  My boyfriend works at a book factory where he can buy books they print for 10 cents a piece, so I had him pick this whole series up for me to try for a grand total of $0.30, and I'm pretty sure I got ripped off.  I gave the books to my mom because I didn't want to have them on my bookshelf in case anyone saw them and mistakenly thought I liked such garbage.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham doesn't disappoint in this latest novel.  The title sort of gave away the ending of the tale, but still great fun and a wonderful read.
B004QL7K6G|1.0|You know with a name like Wanderlust & with a star like Jen Anniston in it, I really had high hopes for this movie, like maybe seeing Jen half naked or something. Well if you're wondering & have yet to see this bomb, wonder no more because there is absolutely no female nudity in this movie at all. Plenty of male nudity though, full frontal & everything confirming that the story was written by a female or male who likes other males. Lame storyline, felt more like a movie that was just thrown together in someone's backyard. If it didn't have the stars in it that it has, it have gone straight to b-movie status in the discount area of the video store. I'm disappointed that Jen would include herself in such a horrible flick, didn't even finish watching it. Avoid this one like the plague...
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|really loved this app but reset me to default when updated way too many times. too frustrating to restart everytime you get established.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|The movie was really good. And I liked the idea of watching movies on my ipad. However the movie buffered every minute to play about two minutes of the movie. Once the problem gets fixed I would love to watch more movies off of amazon.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Great game! plays like a more expensive computer game. I have not found another RPG that I like for the Kindle fire. i have only played for a short time and they asked for a review. I hope the upgrades are not too hard to come by. I will not spend real money on a free game. so far its worth every penny.
B003MC5N28|4.0|The Giver offered a world some people long for and others will fear. The people in the book believe they live a perfect society. No one wants for basic needs like food and shelter. Everyone has an assigned job, and knows what events they should experience with each stage of their life. Everyone is essentially the same. Only one person knows all of the beauty and sorrows of the world, the Giver. And he is about to give that knowledge away to Jonas, the new receiver. As Jonas gains knowledge and memories from the Giver, he begins to worry about all that the community gives up in order to acheive the sameness they live in. Is the lack of fear about war and poverty worth the loss of color and love?<br />This book will make you think about the changes in our own society, and what they might bring. A great way for kids to learn about different social issues as well. I recommend reading it as a family.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I find this series highly entertaining.  Patrick Rothfuss has a unique narrative style that has a depth I rarely see.

B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this app. it is a fun way to pass time. also the flying squirrel thing is so cute!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This is a fantastically inspirational book. Far from your typical \\"woe is me\\" self-help book, this book is a solid kick in the pants while still being supportive (which is a fine line to walk). Huge inspiration for me -- I'm going back and reading it consistently. For me, the final part of the book didn't resonate, but the first sections are SO powerful, this truly should not be missed. Besides, you can read the whole thing in one sitting.
B005LAIIE4|5.0|There are many great joys in life and Disney, the creators of \\"Wreck it Ralph\\", have always been experts at tapping into those emotions. It has been key to their success. Just like the characters in \\"Toy Story\\", we all long to be needed and not necessarily loved, but liked. We want to be included. We want to know that there's somebody out there who thinks of us from time to time and quite simply, that is all that Ralph wants.<br /><br />Locked away inside his game between the hours of open and close of the arcade, Ralph is alone. He's a bad guy. The hero of his game, Fix-it Felix is the star. Felix is the one with the friends and who receives all the accolades. When the arcade closes up for the night, the characters can travel from game to game, they can socialize with each other, but Ralph is alone, with no friends to speak of. Ralph, voiced by John C. Reilly, wants people to like him. He wants people to be proud of him, but being locked away inside his game only allows him to destroy and then get thrown off a building. This triggers a nostalgic and incredibly creative adventure.<br /><br />\\"Wreck it Ralph\\" never really struck me as outwardly hilarious, but the movie is endlessly entertaining and loaded with imagery and blast from the past references. Also like \\"Toy Story\\", another world occurs when people aren't looking and when that world takes off, the video game references from the past will go right over your child's head. The adults though, will recognize characters from Super Mario Bros, Sonic, Q*bert, Street Fighter, Joust, Frogger, Pac-Man, Burger Time, the bartender from the game Tapper and even paddle one and two from the ultra nostalgic game, Pong.<br /><br />Ralph means well, but like most animated movies, that doesn't always lead you in the correct direction. So, when he meets a sweet little 9-year old racer named Vanellope Von Schweetz, voiced by Sarah Silverman, he finds that he's not alone in his plight to be included. Vanellope is a glitch, a flawed character program, hidden away in the system, not allowed to play. The two of them may have formed one of the most memorable character bonds in recent history.<br /><br />While the movie may not be hilariously funny, \\"Wreck it Ralph\\" is sheer joy and fun and it taps into an emotion that many adults have forgotten and many kids know all too well. It reminds you what it is like that first time you realized that you had a friend. Your child will also see a nice example of friendship and loyalty. This, in my opinion, makes \\"Wreck it Ralph\\" not just a movie for kids, but for adults as well. With all the references of nostalgic games and its flawless reminder of how euphoric friendship is, \\"Ralph\\" is for everybody.ed character program, hidden away in the system, not allowed to play.

1442300051|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  The second most important thing about this book is how funny it is.  As every reviewer says, Michael Lewis is a wonderful story teller.  He follows a few men as they puzzle over the bond market wondering what they're missing that everyone else on Wall Street understands. Oh, as it turns out, everyone else does not understand. These quirky few men pore over documents, research and interviews to discover that bundled subprime mortgage bonds are bolstered by false ratings--and then cloned into ghost-like copies to increase this falsely-bolstered market. On their way to enlightenment and to enlightening others, their ah-ha moments are laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />Which brings me to the most important thing about this book: the sand-like ignorance that was the foundation of the Wall Street institutions that buckled in 2008. There are many breath-taking moments for the reader who sees how low mortgages on overpriced homes balloon into high ones, sees millions turn into billions, and sees Wall Street buyers scramble lemming-like for huge stakes in the market. And then, after the crash, the reader sees that many of those responsible for great losses have made themselves rich, and others like Messrs Paulson, Bernanke, Geithner, for example, ironically were put in charge of fixing the mess.<br /><br />Michael Lewis warmed my heart in his introduction when he said he took his first job on Wall Street knowing nothing and left three years later richer, but still knowing nothing.  He sought to gain understanding and shares that understanding with well-rewarded readers.
B005S9ELQ2|4.0|In 1979 the republic of Iran erupted into a revolution and Islamic militants stormed and took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The militants took 52 American hostages but 6 of them managed to get out a back exit and make their way to the Canadian embassy. In the Canadian embassy, they were also imprisoned, in a way. Although they were safe in the embassy for the time being, the entire nation of Iran was in chaos and they were lashing out at Americans. It wasn't safe to leave and getting out of the country was nearly impossible. Their days in the embassy were numbered and the American government knew they had to act fast to save them.<br /><br />\\"Argo\\" is based on an improbable but true story that was classified for years until 1996 when President Bill Clinton declassified it. Faced with impossible odds, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA officer, was brought into a meeting to discuss how to rescue them. As was described in the film, Mendez came up with the best bad idea they could up with. It didn't occur right away, but the idea was to go through all the actions of a potential moving filming in Iran and fake the hostages as members of the crew scouting out a location to film. Helping him was a Hollywood makeup artist named John Chambers (John Goodman) and Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin).<br /><br />Ben Affleck directed and starred in the film, not unlike he did with the movie \\"The Town. Affleck also directed his brother in \\"Gone Baby Gone\\". Both movies received critical acclaim and Affleck's \\"Argo\\" will most certainly follow suit. The authenticity of the film is to be heralded. Affleck, in order to achieve the look on screen that a 1979 incident would look like, Affleck shot the movie on old film and zoomed in on the reel in order to increase the graininess. With the costuming, settings and recreations of the Iranian revolution, Affleck may have achieving the most amazing effect of his career. It takes you back to that time, whether you remember it or not.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in order to ramp up the tension and drama, Affleck resorted to some typical old Hollywood gimmicks that seemed odd in a historical reenactment. Whether or not Jimmy Carter and the officials stateside reissued the tickets at the last second, as depicted in the film, I don't know, but it sure seemed contrived. This wasn't the only one either. In fact, it happened multiple times. Phones ringing and if that person doesn't answer, the entire operation is dead, but their held up by a studio lot film shoot and don't know the phone is ringing. All was there to ramp up the tension and I guess it worked because the movie worked.<br /><br />\\"Argo\\" is not a nail biter grit your teeth suspense movie as some have promoted. Had the dangerousness of the Iranian guards been ramped up a bit more, maybe it would have been. Although, you are aware of what they're facing just because we're living it in our current life, but I think the film was too soft on ramping this up, possibly not to offend a culture that doesn't like being offended. The movie is though, an incredibly authentic look into a part of history that remained untold until 1996 and untold widely until now.rtunately, in order to ramp up the tension and drama, Affleck resorted to some typical old Hollywood gimmicks that seemed odd in a historical reenactment.

B00A2H9LK6|1.0|In 2006, the original \\"Silent Hill\\" was released and had a unique and well constructed story with a twist and a slow boiling tension throughout the film. \\"Silent Hill\\" is based on a highly successful video game series and the movie release, in my opinion, was one of the better adaptions and is still a very good movie to check out if you ever get the chance.<br /><br />\\"Silent Hill 2: Revelation\\" follows up on the story from the original. A premise that leaves mother and daughter, Rose (Radha Mitchell) and Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), trapped in the mysterious town of Silent Hill. Meanwhile, father and daughter, Christopher (Sean Bean) and Sharon (Adelaide Clemens), now named Heather, are in the real world and on the run from a strange cult who wants Sharon/Heather. Yes, Sharon is in both worlds, her soul and body split into two and that is why the cult wants her back.<br /><br />You may gather that the movie's storyline is confusing and convoluted. Well, it is. It will help to watch the original movie from 2006 to understand most of it. Walking into \\"Silent Hill 2\\" without having some understanding of the game series and/or the original movie, would be a large mistake. Even if you have seen or played the things related to this movie, you will find the storyline completely scattered and even at times nonsensical. I have seen and played some of these and even I found the movie confusing and scatterbrained.<br /><br />\\"Silent Hill 2\\" does some things right. The monster effects are tremendous. The deadly homicidal nurses who move and freeze based on sounds were well done and the spider monster was incredibly cool, especially in 3D. The 3D effects in general were some of the best I've seen. When the ash from the burning town falls across Silent Hill, it feels as though the ash is falling right in your lap. The actress Adelaide Clemens did a great job, even if she does look frighteningly like Michelle Williams.<br /><br />On the bad side, the game series of \\"Silent Hill\\" is about puzzle solving and mystery. The movie tried to have puzzles and mystery, but nearly all of these were poorly handled and didn't give the audience a chance to play along. Most of the movies plot movements were illogical. One moment, Heather states that she doesn't know where the town Silent Hill is, but 2 scenes later they are there. She doesn't know anything about Silent Hill as well, yet the first person she sees there, she instantly states that she knows who she is.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Silent Hill 2\\" is a trip through a haunted house and it has the same effect as well. Some of the jump outs scare you, but for the most part, it is a not-very smart follow up to a very smart original. Not to mention, the ending was anti-climatic and illogical. A very disappointing Halloween movie.about puzzle solving and mystery.

1421550644|5.0|For any Miyazaki or Ghibli fan, this is definitely something you'll want to check out.  It includes two large books that are a collection of volumes 1-7 and also includes a horizontal/vertical reversible poster.  The books come in a slipcase box and have great binding.  Definitely worth the money.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I didn't think I would like this game but it is very addictive.  I enjoy looking for items that are hidden in the rooms.  The challenge is finding the items at night, your flashlight is somewhat dim which makes it hard to see but it is a wonderful game.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I would thought I might hate it, but I quite enjoyed it. It was a great sci fi movie to watch with the family.
0062017926|4.0|The thing I enjoy most about Rollins' books are how fast pasted and action packed they are. He marries just enough description to the action to enable you to visualize everything perfectly. It is almost like seeing a movie in your head as you read them..and this one is no exception.  I have to take a star off for some of the concepts that are just too improbable. I know to enjoy a movie you sometimes have to suspend your disbelief and just go with it.  Rollins does this so much that I find myself being taken out of the story and thinking more about how what just happened is impossible, rather than his story and characters, both of which are interesting and compelling.<br />The characters do carry through from one book to the next with minimal explanation, so if you are new to the series, I highly suggest starting at the beginning and reading through.  If you dont, you will still enjoy the books..but it adds a nuance to already know the back story on some of the characters.<br />Other than that, I think this book, as all his others, is great for a fast, fun read.  You can easily stop and pick them back up and get right back into the action, which is why I carry them for travel and for when I have to wait for appointments.  Money well spent.
B0002KZAKS|2.0|I used the XM8500 only a few times before deciding to find a better mic. This mic has excellent noise reduction qualities, but lacks the warmth and clarity that I was looking for. I wound up purchasing the Audix OM-6 and would recommend it to anyone.

Hopefully, William will be different.

B007THA4FI|2.0|As an English teacher, I know that the ultimate goal is to include the reader on the author's journey; however,  Casual Vacancy was very difficult to read.  It did not flow for the reader.  Also, the English semantics (Great Britain) was challenging and difficult to follow in several places.
B005ILYWN2|5.0|I had never heard of this Norwegian movie.  I am really glad I did, though, because it is very entertaining with its \\"mockumentary\\" format and awesome visual effects.  Screening it with the native soundtrack really added to the unique Scandinavian flavor.  Excellent movie - wish I knew about it when it came out two years ago.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|Seeing as this is only the first book in the series of the walking dead, I expected a lot of time getting to know the characters and barely any action or deaths of characters. How wrong I was the first book while it did introduce and build upon characters e.g. Rick, Lori. I still feel as if I barely know most of the characters in this story, which left me wanting slightly more in that aspect. However this minor flaw should not put others off the series. The art work is amazing and as I have mentioned this is just the beginning, I personally can't wait to get to know and see what happens to these characters.

I do agree that it could have used a few more story elements mixed in to better connect a few puzzles.  I was able to figure most things out on my own, but did need the walkthru to get over a couple hurdles. I think that the tile puzzle should have those pics someplace in the game.<br /><br />I really had a good time with this one. I dont agree with some of the 1 star reviews who didnt like it because it was hard, or because they got lost. This game is for those who like a real challenge. Way to go devs. Im planning to try haunt 2 that others have mentioned in their reviews.

B002IR3PSC|4.0|I missed the \\"Song From the Woods\\" tour in the Fall of 1977 - but I got to see the \\"Storm Watch\\" tour that followed 1 year later at Madison Square Garden. Everyone loved that concert at the Garden but there was impatience because JT played too much stuff from the StormWatch album - instead - it seemed to me that everyone in the Garden wanted a complete reincarnation of the Songs From the Wood tour. I knew this because many people in the audience booed JT at the end of the concert - because J.T. played too much songs from the \\"StormWatch\\" album [although we would love to hear songs like Orion and King Henry's Madigral\\" played today with the likes of Mr [Ms.] Palmer and John Evan around. I gambled that this DVD would capture the best of that concert I saw - songs like \\"Songs from the Wood\\" and \\"Thick as a Brick,\\" among others are all there.<br />If you are as old as me [50] - you can easily be sent back in time when you were a teenage Tull fan - the DVD captures Tull at its best or at least in it's Golden Renaissance.<br />It's too bad the DVD only features audio for the first set of songs - unfortunately it was never filmed.  At least you get the audio of these songs and a CD with the concert to boot.

B003ZMF26W|5.0|i played a lot of FPS with the mico key it could reduce recole or make semi-automatic guns into fully automatic. i had this mouse for over a year and never had any trouble with it but when i does break i going to buy another one from here :D
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book was vintage Grisham with a twist; a good read.  A pattern of money laundering and the Cayman Islands is present, but it does not detract from the story. I'll read it again.
B006N57PXG|3.0|Rather too descriptive for my taste but a good book. Characters we easy to get attached too. Nathaniel or John was easy to follow. The djinn was a bit to harsh.
B008KE3960|1.0|if I was going to play this game I would jump off a bridge with my friends and swim with the sharks
B00275EHJG|5.0|I consider this third part a lot better than the first and the second one. This is a movie for the whole family. I highly recommend it.
B00138CZIS|5.0|This album is pretty freakin' awesome. I love System of a Down, and this album has like all their best songs on it.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|The movie is excellent, it has a very good message. Some scenes can be frightening for kids but they are part of the story, I mean, those scenes appear in the book too. Anyway, I do not recommend it to very young kids.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book has a lot more going on behind the scenes than the movie does. And it really works to pull the reader in
B007MDB548|4.0|Meet Tinker Bell who flies everywhere<br />Her land is warm, her weather's fair<br />But Peri's only seen the sights<br />Of winter days and winter nights<br />What a crazy pair!<br />But they're fairies, identical fairies all the way<br />One pair of sprightly pixies, different as night and day!<br /><br />While Peri adores to pirouette<br />On landscapes cold as they can get<br />Our Tink just seems to have the goal<br />Of making Vidia lose control<br />What a wild duet!<br /><br />But they're fairies, identical fairies and you'll find<br />Their wings get sparkly rays alike, they even disobey alike<br />You could lose your mind<br />When fairies are two of a kind!<br /><br />Tinker Bell: The Secret of the Wings, the first Disney Fairies feature to actually be released near the actual season in which it takes place, is a sweeping epic in which Tink discovers she has a twin sister, Periwinkle. Peri lives in a frosty world ruled by former James Bond Timothy Dalton (who also voiced Mr. Pricklypants in Toy Story 3). Naturally, the twins spend too much time in their respective other lands and adventures ensue.<br /><br />It's a beautifully rendered production, really an art direction triumph. And in Blu-ray, it's especially stunning to see. The songs are by the talented husband and wife duo Valerie Vigoda and Brendan Milburn, who also recently scored a musical version of Toy Story for Disney Cruise Line and have a series of inventive original musicals created for their band, Groovelily.<br /><br />The teen angle has been ramped up in this film, with the addition of more \\"hunky\\" sprites, almost to the point of being unintentionally humorous, as in one final moment in which a young guy struts onto the scene and says, \\"Hey. I'm Sled.\\"<br /><br />Vigoda and Milburn also wrote songs for Pixie Hollow Games, a 30-minute TV special relegated to bonus features status on this package. What it might lack in budget compared to the more lavish Wings feature, it makes up for in charm and character development.<br /><br />Pixie Hollow Games focuses on two fairies: Rosetta, voiced to perfection by Megan Hilty, and newcomer Chloe, played by Brenda Song (of Zack & Cody and The Social Network). Rosetta may be a garden fairy, but she's a tootsie-toes with more than a touch of OCD. Chloe's atheticism makes the two of them an \\"Odd Couple\\" and thus fodder for a very entertaining, fast moving and fun little show.<br /><br />The extras are not elaborate, not even on a promotional level, when compared to earlier Tinker Bell releases. Wings is nice, but Great Fairy Rescue is still, to me, the best of the four features so far.rm and character development.<br /><br />Pixie Hollow Games focuses on two fairies: Rosetta, voiced to perfection by Megan Hilty, and newcomer Chloe, played by Brenda Song (of Zack & Cody and The Social Network).

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun game but it takes a while to get points but there are a lot of games so I guess this game is pretty fun so you should get it a mean it is free afterall
B008XX6J4C|3.0|Don't get me wrong, the music is awesome. Probably perfect if played while having a glass of wine or taking your last smoke before bed. But its kinda like &#34;listening to a brilliant movie&#34;.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|The movie was exactly what I expected. It had a little something for everyone. It was very good.  Not for children under 13 years old.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I honestly didn't know anything about the Jaycee Dugard story other than the minimal basics that were portrayed on different news and radio stations before I decided to read this book. I was blown away when I learned about all the details she shared while living as the Garrido's captor!! I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to gain more insight into what went on proceeding this infamous court case, and for anyone looking for something inspirational to read, because in my opinion Jaycee Dugard is one of the strongest, most courageous young women I've seen who has learned to live life beyond the unspeakable  horrors she faced for 18 unimaginable years!!!
B00913DPW2|5.0|What a great game.  If you ever enjoyed games like Myst out Riven you will love this game.  The game has just the right amount of difficulty.  I found myself having trouble putting the game down.  Best game so far for my phone.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I couldn't wait to find out how the whole thing played out. I found some of Patricia Cornwell's books in years past were a challenge to finish. The last 3 or 4 have been quick reads. I had to sit down and read as I really wanted to know how it ended. This book is a great addition to this series.
B0084I9QI2|4.0|I love what this package offers. Definitely worth every penny. Was shipped perfectly.  Love the magnetic box that holds the cds and dvds.  I was, however, disappointed with the cardboard case for the cds and dvd. The cardboard is not really a secure place to put them in and the edges were slightly jagged.
B008VBYN80|5.0|you will probably do more if you go the face book route. however not a bad way to waste a few minutes of your day.
B009VW9ELY|5.0|It was very fun to watch. Enjoyed the special appearance made by Adam Lambert. Felt like a little more was solved to the Alison mystery. Also, has a few surprising moments.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|another great book by DeMille....if you're a fan of his work then don't hesistate to purchase this one.  From start to finish it's a wild ride...
B008AK8FHM|1.0|It starts out as an interesting story that is never finished or fully explained. Then it turns into something else unreadable.
0345803485|2.0|I started reading 50 Shades, but I couldn't get past the writing style. For me the book was not enjoyable, simply because I found it unreadable. Also, I felt it lacked drama and authentic characters. In any case, I did just pick up a new book by Elle Haan, called Alive: A Life, which is more my speed. Being that I am from NYC I am finding it more real and then some. If 50 Shades was for the ladies in the burbs, which it felt like to me, Haan's book is for the cosmopolitan girl. In any case, I believe 50 SoG opened up the libidos of many and that's great!
B002RXTWWA|5.0|We watched this with our 10 yr old boy because he wanted to see Frankenstein at Halloween and we felt the newer versions were inappropriate.  The movie was a good choice.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I purchased this headset even after reading all the negative feedback. I was able to adjust the sound settings using the graphic equalizer, I read the complaints about the sound I had no problems after making adjustments. The sound while listening to music was incrediable!!! While playing Battle 4 Play for free I was amazed of the sound effects. I have always trusted Logitect products, next purchase I am contemplating a gaming keydoard, mouse & speakers. WAY TO GO LOGITECH!!!!!!!!!
0800141709|5.0|A classic movie at a very affordable price. Would purchase from this buyer again. ordered on Friday,and receieved it on Monday!

B001KZG99A|5.0|This is an ironclad winner! Good plot excellent special effects - guaranteed to entertain.<br />Part of the Avengers super-hero group, Ironman and Captain America are two best \\"singles\\" of the series.
B0064O927I|5.0|I love the new style of this watch , nice touch but strange numbers ,<br /><br />I like the new look , the new way , Expensive slightly
B004SB60OC|4.0|I like the song Jar of Hearts so I started YouTubing Christina Perri at work one day. OMG I'm so happy I did. I ended up buying this CD. Its so smooth and good and her voice is lovely and perfect. It's a great CD to chill to, not very upbeat, just smooth and solid. I would definitely recommend to others. I cant wait for her next CD!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I watched this so I could get ready for Taken 2.  This movie is awesome and Liam Neeson is a badass
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I'd heard mixed reviews prior to and during the theatric release of this film and opted to wait. When it came available on Blu-Ray, I decided to take a chance and purchase the title rather than wait to view it first via rental. I was not disappointed. The film does an excellent job of showing the sequence of events that would later lead to the Nostromo discovering the huge abandoned spacecraft in the movie Alien. I did knock my rating down one star because of one major detail glitch in the Prometheus: SPOILER ALERT - the alien pilot should have died in the seat of his own spacecraft and not on the floor of the company lifeboat to properly bridge into 'Alien'. Nevertheless, it also shows how the 'Aliens' that infect their hosts will mutate based upon the hosts they take. The cinematography and action was all well-done, I've now watched the movie several times and can highly recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What more can i say best show ever need more shows like this faithfully watch this show every time it is on
0307200477|3.0|After wearing out two previous Pat the Bunny books with the first two kids, it was an essential purchase for #3. Extra pages?? For sure! Can Pat the Bunny get better?? The extra pages were nice, but for some reason, every time this book was opened, the pages came off the spiral bounding. I ended up returning it and will be going with the trusty smaller version.
0810970686|5.0|I totally enjoy reading Diary books to ELi... We both laugh the entire time and it is a great cheap family time to bond and enjoy eachother and humor

B009G78EE2|5.0|best album ever so freakin sick.  Everyone should by this, even if they don't like rap.  Macklemore is amazing. He doesn't even have a record label.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Watched this movie on an airline flight and it kept my attention well and enjoyed watching it. Definitely worth the money and worth the time to watch.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I had to review this movie because I saw it on opening day in a regular theater and the next day in IMAX. I pre-bought my tickets and was excited to be able to get to see the last movie of the trilogy since I own the first two movies. Yes, I spent over $100.00 for this movie and I cannot believe it was so awful.  Before I get crucified, I just want to say that I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't push myself to do it even while watching it in IMAX.  It was just so much worse the second day. A second viewing showed how sorely lacking the movie was.<br /><br />I know people are screaming that this movie was Epic but I found it to be epically bad.  I took my son who is 12 and he didn't like it at all and told me that I didn't have to buy this one. My mom fell asleep and my daughters thought it was way too long and boring.  I went the first day to a crowded Manhattan theater where every seat was filled and all I heard were \\"crickets\\".  We spent so much time asking each other what Bane and Bruce Wayne said that after a while, it was just frustrating and we stopped asking and let the movie run its course.  The next day in IMAX was just a little bit better but not much and by then it just became louder garbled nonsense from Bane and Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />Needless to say that I will not be purchasing this movie.  It was just not worth it on any level and I certainly don't want to waste any more of my time. Chris Nolan, this ending could have and should have been so much better. Unfortunately, we are stuck with this.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|This was at times a wrenching story..of a family's dysfunction and the resulting  aftermath to the twin sister and brother.<br />But, the young boy was able to to continue his journey into distant and frightening places, people and events. His relisilience was heroic..even though he didn't know it. He managed to cope with horrendous events and still maintain his sense of his own identity and personhood.The strength of character he developed was nothing short of heroic. He was able to grow into a person with care and concern for others. It was no surprise that he became a teacher--as he had so much to give to others.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This book was a little hard to get started due to the alternating past and present every other chapter.  However, I really enjoyed it and will definitely look for other books from this author.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I found this book to be moving and comforting  - I read it just after the passing of my Mother. I had heard of the Newsweek article and interview of Dr. Eben Alexander and saw that he had written a book about his near death experience. I have read other NDE books and found them \\"light\\" on the actual experiences that they had. What intrigued me most about Dr. Alexander's book is that he was able to balance more of his heavenly experiences throughout the entire book and tried to keep his earthly life to a minimum. I do have to confess that Dr. Alexander plugged the Monroe music company for relaxation and spiritual awakening. I hope that his use of the Monroe products was sincere and that there is no financial ties for a plug in his book.<br /><br />Otherwise it is worth the read and Dr. Alexander confirmed my own belief and faith in the human spirit as eternal and loved. It is pretty difficult to put unhuman experiences into human terms or language; that is a tall order for any author. Hopefully Dr. Alexander will be able to further his study of NDE's and show tangible ways to experience what he experienced.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Awesome, A real page turner I work a full time job but was so into this book I read it in 5 days!!!
B005S9ELM6|4.0|Based on the actual historical events from 33 years ago, new Ben Affleck's film \\"Argo\\" which he produced, directed and starred in, is an excellent picture and a gorgeous thriller. The film recreates the episode associated with the rescue of six American diplomats, who managed to escape from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the assault and seizure of the embassy by Iranian militant students-rebels on Nov. 4, 1979, and who found refuge in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador at the time, Ken Taylor. CIA in conjunction with Canadian government had come up with an ingenious and risky operation in saving and extracting the six from Tehran from which even a bird would not be able to fly undetected. The film depicts in details the operation that for long 18 years remained classified. I would not argue that \\"Argo\\" may not be historically absolutely accurate but am not going to blame its creators for that. \\"Argo\\" turns to be a fascinating piece of cinema and a very timely film, despite the fact that the story it tells took place over 30 years ago.<br /><br />For many years, Ben Affleck was for me a lesser part of the creative and friendly alliance with Matt Damon. Matt was \\"Talented Mr. Damon,\\" and Ben - mostly, a pretty boy whose acting career hit the rock bottom with \\"Gigli\\", and who became famous as the first syllable in the created by media frenzy compound word Bennifer. I am happy to admit that I was wrong about Benjamin Geza Affleck. Well, he is still the first syllable in the compound word Bennifer, with the different Jennifer though, but he's got real talent as the film director with the sharp clear vision, undeniable craft, and confident style of directing. Ben Affleck is gradually becoming one of my favorite American directors: \\"Gone Baby Gone\\", \\"The Town\\", and now - \\"Argo.\\" The latter is without doubt his best work so far and I highly recommend it. I would not be surprised at all that when the awards season arrives, both \\"Argo\\" and Affleck will be mentioned as the nominees for several prestigious awards. The film has a lot going for it. One remarkable scene follows another. From the first frames, \\"Argo's director creates unbearable tension, pulls the viewer inside the screen and holds them there until the end. One of my favorite scenes has Tony Mendes (Affleck) riding a cab from the Airport upon his arrival to Tehran. Pay close attention to what he sees and how short cuts form the streets of Tehran intertwined. For this scene alone, I believe Affleck deserves nomination for directing.<br /><br />Pay attention how the tone of the film changes with the Hollywood scenes and how much of professional knowledge of starting the film production details Affleck uses. Making two fine actors John Goodman and Alan Arkin playing the roles of two prominent film personalities who agreed to take part in rescue operation from Hollywood, brings real humor in the dramatic and intense story. The final part of the film is purest Hollywood of its best times when the tension becomes unbearable, and I say this with admiration, because these scenes do not depend on the dizzying special effects, but on the pulsing pace, intense interaction among the characters and their emotions, and the flawless editing that cuts among several scenes occurring simultaneously in different and distant from each other, parts of the globe. While watching the film, especially the final chapters, you squeeze the armrest of your chair hard and clench your fists so the nails dig into the palms.<br /><br />As we grow older, it gets more and more difficult to lose yourself in the movie, which is after all, only an illusion, 24 lies per second. Rarely can a film completely convince the viewer that the line between him and the screen is gone. I am grateful to Ben Affleck for making me forget about that line while watching the best scenes of \\"Argo\\". I completely trusted him as a filmmaker.<br /><br />I am not going to talk about plot details here. With this film, the less the audience knows about the plot before they watch the film, the better. I only say that bearded Affleck with longer hair looks as convincing in front as he is behind it. Bravo, Ben! I advise you to pay close attention to the prologue of the film before the credits. Affleck remarkably well used animating technique illustrating historical events that led to the crisis of the American hostages in Iran, 1979-1981. Don't leave the theater the film is seemingly over. It is not. For few minutes we are treated to the epilogue where the portraits of actors and their counterparts are compared, and some details of their after Argo lives are revealed.<br /><br />I'd like to add few words about John Chambers, the character played by John Goodman. John Chambers was in fact one of Hollywood greatest make-up artists. His most famous work using the prosthetic make-up techniques for numerous ape -people from the first classic film with Charlton Heston, \\"Planet of Apes\\" (1968) and the characters of the series \\"Star Trek\\". Chambers was honored with Oscar for his work on \\"Planet of the Apes.\\" It was the first Academy Award in the category for outstanding makeup. Compassionate human being, Chambers also devoted his talents to help with the face restoration to the soldiers disfigured during the war, as well as to cancer survivors.<br /><br />4.5 of 5 stars - excellent filmhe audience knows about the plot before they watch the film, the better.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is perfect to fill idle time. fairly easy to lose an hour or so. a no brainer. carnival favorite at home.
B007TK77QE|5.0|From start to finish this was a brilliant book.  Not having read those other J K Rowling books I had no preconceptions about the style of writing.  She gets you involved with the characters and amazed at how a life altering event for one person in a small town can affect so many others.  Definitely worth reading.
0062206281|3.0|As an avid fan of Carlos Ruiz Zafon, I regret having to say that I stopped reading this book. The incessant and gratuitous descriptions of the grotesque, depraved and truly barbaric treatment of the prisoners brought me, as a reader, down into that same hell and the prisoners' anguish became my anguish. I closed the book.

B004H83IM8|3.0|Cheap copy. Missing the inside flyer. Possible bootleg. Discs do not make sense. First disc in package has artwork on it, but is the second movie in series. First movie and third movie are on one disc, only one side is even marked with tiny writing at center, wouldn't have even know there was a movie on the other side if I had not flipped it over and tried it. Movies played ok, but the way it is packaged just makes me wonder if it is a bootleg.
0385504209|2.0|Finally got around to reading this after years of being harassed by the locals. I really do not see the big deal.<br /><br />This is a work of Fiction but apparently people are taking this for fact.

0316228532|1.0|I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, and I had hoped that Rowling's first attempt at an adult book would be good.  I had a hard time getting through this book- the characters weren't that interesting, and I found myself putting the book down without much joy in picking it back up again.  I only finished it b/c I sincerely hoped that she was going to have some wonderful twist or SOMETHING to make it worth my while.  At least I got it from the library and didn't waste my money.  I think she's better suited to children's literature- surely with her creativity and imagination, she could write another interesting children's series.

1577314808|5.0|It was with a great deal of skepticism that I began to read this book. I knew it had received a lot of positive reviews, but I wondered, is it written by a person that is scamming the public intentionally by collecting the wisdom from several sources and offering them up as spiritual hyperbole, or more innocently someone that has had some kind of \\"spiritual\\" experience and as is typical, mistaken the map for the territory and communicated half-truths? The more I read the more I realized that this book was written by someone that had experienced what he was talking about and talked about it with a degree of clarity that can only come from clarity of thought, and this clarity of thought can only come to rare individuals that are able, as he says in his book, distance themselves for the thought process itself--hence as he says, the root of all creative acts.  This book is wonderful: clear and profound, and highly recommended. It says on the back of the book that \\"He writes with the timeless and uncomplicated clarity of the ancient spiritual masters.\\"  Like who? They should have been able to write with this clarity. I suppose it has to do with the times in which they wrote but who wrote with clarity? The interpreters of the Buddha's talks? My beloved but nearly unreadable Plotinus? Meister Eckhart and other unreadable, \\"local\\"-interpreting Christian mystics, with the exception of a few, like St. Teresa of Avila? This book has a deceptive simplicity to it. If you are well read in the mysticism of the East and or West, Mr. Tolle's words will resonate with even more meaning, but I am quite sure that this would not be his goal. It would be simply to understand what he is talking about in an immediate, personal way. In this sense, there is nothing new here, but rather the old timeless truths--you are the Self beyond anything you can perceive--clarified for the modern reader. I was reminded of Nisargadatta (I Am That) so often when reading the book. That would be a great companion or follow up to this one. You may find this book to be a treasure as I did. Also recommended is Jane Roberts books, particularly in relation to Mr. Tolle's discussion of the inner body concept: the beginning of The Nature of Personal Reality where she talks about the concept of the \\"feeling tone\\" and her discussion of the present as the point of power throughout that book; and The Seth Material, particularly at the end where the inner senses are discussed. This would give the reader a fuller idea of many of the concepts that Mr. Tolle so beautifully discusses.anion or follow up to this one. You may find this book to be a treasure as I did.

THey are wide looking and it looks like I have wide feet. This is the second online shoes I got and the first one I got didn't fit and they weren't crocs. It was just nonslip shoes from another company and I had about had it, so I kept the crocs. They weren't comfortable at all at first, but i hear it takes a couple of weeks to break in. I haven't had them for quit a week yet and they are getting better. It is suppose to mold to your feet. Well right now I have gels,because my feet would hurt at the end of the day even with gels they did too. Now they don't hurt anymore. The guy at work loves his and says they are the best, so that is why I got them. I guess a lot of people working in the restaurants do.

B002N7P23I|4.0|This movie is entertaining and has some interesting twists and turns. I would have preferred the original version with subtitles rather than it being dubbed, but still good. If you want to watch the American version it's called Quarantine - so dubbing the original was pointless.
B001DRF84W|5.0|Perfect visual and audio experience, lots of extra content, u control, cheap, fast delivery. Definitely worths its price, a must have for a real Marvel/HULK/Avengers/Comic book/Ang Lee/Eric Bana/Movie fan.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|My favorite animated movie. I'm not usually a huge fan of these movies but this was one was a class apart.

B008GVD6D8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and the first book bared to you... I have also read the 3 fifty shades which I enjoyed very much.. even though these books are on the same lines but the story line is very different once I got into the books I found it hard to put them down... I have  preordered the 3rd book and it cant come to me quick enough!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Rolling Stone gave it a good reveiw and it was an author I have not read and so far it is a great read.
B002PNF8HK|1.0|Totally lame, not even enough action to keep your interest.  Bypass this movie choice and watch something else. You have been warned!
030759565X|2.0|As much as I love the Smitten Kitchen blog, I was a little disappointed with the book.  I had been looking forward to buying the book as soon as the author announced its publication, but upon looking at the number of entree recipes in it, I had to pass on it.  I believe there are only 3 or 4 chicken entree recipes.  Since I usually cook chicken for dinner during the week there just weren't enough recipes that were actually useful to me.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a book with many dessert and vegetarian ideas, this may be for you.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game itself works well. The ads are a little ridiculous but I've never had ads pop up when I'm not playing.
B009PEPML4|5.0|Admittedly, I'm already a fan so I was going to like this anyway.  Never having been able to see them live, these are all new songs to me.<br />In contrast to their other albums, much less spoken word/random recordings, and I'd say more \\"rocking\\" as well.  Yes that's a terrible descriptor, but I'm not sure how else to say it.<br />I've purposely never listened to a Silver Mtn. Zion et al. as the thought of GYBE members actually singing is not something I want.<br />This was epic and made my weekend to listen to it.
B000001Y5X|5.0|I looked in Every Store and Couldnt find this cd. So I Logged onto Amazon. Searched it up and Their it was. SO i bought it on a good Deal. Worth Every Penny.

0307455874|5.0|When he said \\"I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook, man.\\"<br /><br />Now, some of you may say there are heaps and heaps of institutional racism in that quote, but Joe Biden meant it as a compliment -- so just deal with it. I'm just glad Joe is a democrat or he would have been skewered in the mainstream media for this. Phew!<br /><br />Barack O'Bama is a hero of mine and I hope I can get oratory skills like his. Sometimes when the sun sets and late TV shows come around I imagine that Barry is on the couch next to me and we're sharing a cigarette. He's a Marlboro Light guy, I'm a Virginia Slims 100s.<br /><br />We just have a rap session. And we put our heads together and try to figure out how to make our country great again. And then we agree that a good start would be to lower the drinking age to 16. We wrestle a little bit and at one point he has my arms pinned down and he asks me if I've always had such beautiful eyes.<br /><br />Anyway, great man and an even better book.
B009F879HK|2.0|How many more times do they want us to keep buying Love Me Do and PS I Love You?Taking nothing away from these two great Beatles tunes,but if you have The Beatles first album,theres no reason to get this.I saw it in a store and passed.Ill stick with CDs.
1426209584|5.0|I have always had a fascination with the birds of paradise.  I am not sure where or when I first saw pictures of these incredible birds but it was many many many years ago.<br /><br />This is the book I had hoped for and it finally has been printed.<br /><br />I was most fortunate in a visit to the Zoo in Jakarta, Indonesia to have a Greater Bird-Of-Paradise sit on my arm for 5 or so minutes while I fed it mealy worms.  You could purchase a small cup of mealy worms from a attendant and then the bird would fly from a high perch and sit on your arm waiting to be fed. The thrill of seeing that bird so very close and being able to observe it as it ate was a thrill I will never forget. The dents left in my arm from the claws were uncomfortable to say the least but well worth it to see him so close.<br /><br />The video \\"Birds of the Gods\\" by David Attenborough was also fantastic and if you haven't seen it it is an absolute must. I hope that the video on this book by National Geographic to be issued later this month is as good as the book.<br /><br />I did read another reviewer offering some criticism about the photography in the book.  I absolutely could find no fault with the colors or the beauty of the pictures.  I notice in some pictures that some of the feathers are out of focus blurring them and this is because of the birds motion and/or depth of field problems and not the fault of the photographer. The colors of these birds as shown from what I have seen in person and in Attenborough's video are spot on. Their brilliance is almost unbelievable. The color saturation of the feathers are intense to say the least.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is fascinated with the Birds of Paradise.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book it that I would rather have it in a vertical format rather than \\"letter box\\".
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have read all her books and am a big fan.  However, this one is only so-so and I am disappointed.  Very little substance to the plot; vague references to the past used as filler--not enough set up for some of the action...just kind of vague all around.  Definately not up to par with the rest of the series.  I won't preorder and pay premium prices for the next one.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I have really liked all of Kate Morton's books.  While this one did seem to have spots that were slower than some of the others but it still kept me engaged and had all the twists and turns I have come to expect from a Kate Morton book.  As it ramped up to the end I still couldn't put it down, turning pages as fast as possible to find out what was coming and just when I thought I had it all figured out she surprised me again.  Well done.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it.
B00138KE5Y|5.0|Excellent collection of Barbara Streisand. She makes for easy listening and her songs are timeless. I especially enjoy when she sings with others.

B009FZFONO|5.0|I have watched Walking Dead since it started, and season 3 by my standards is the best season yet! The HD part is ok, but I bought the hd and the standard and they really don't have much of a difference when I watch them on my Xbox threw the Amazon Instant Videos app. It could also just be my internet not getting enough signal to produce the HD.
B000NY12CI|5.0|Excellent book written by an incredible woman.  This story is not for the meek.  During the first 60 pages I must have said OMG at least a half dozen times.  Being a woman in Somalia isn't easy.
0525953728|5.0|There is a lot of room for hype in such an historic raid, but Mark Owen indulges in none of it. He gives a lot of interesting background by telling the story of his Navy career, then gives a straightforward account of the UBL raid itself. All of it is very interesting - I read the whole book in one weekend - but none of it is exaggerated, glamorized, or self-serving. Owen goes out of his way to give credit where credit is due. He points out that for the SEALs, this was just another day at work - a pretty straightforward raid of the type he and his team had done a thousand times. His humility was what struck me most about this book - it could have been full of chest-beating, sensationalism and politicization. Instead, it was honest, straightforward, and unselfish. Great read.
0920668372|5.0|This book never fails to bring tears to my eyes.  It makes me think about how much I will always love my little boy, no matter how big he gets.  It's a very sweet story about a mother's love for her child, and later on, the love is returned from the son.<br /><br />You can read into this any way you want, but to me it's just a story.  Kids don't understand the perception that adults have that rocking your adult child might be a little creepy.  I suppose if you can't get past this then you might want to purchase another book.  That being said, you'd be missing a really wonderful story.<br /><br />The illustrations are cute, but it's the words that make this book what it is, and the lasting impression you get after reading it.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Loved ..my 22 year old daughter's favorite movie as a toddler...she had all the words memorized. She watched it so much...it was in VHS format...she rewound her favorite parts so much it broke. I was so happy this came out on DVD

B009P13RQY|5.0|Love this record, The Sword are really moving forward with their style and subject matter, the production is pristine and the mix, especially, is by far the best on any of their albums. Love the excellent bass work and use of some evil synth really takes it to a sort of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath / Space Ritual level. Awesome.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|The ESV study Bible is an excellent Bible study resource providing virtually everything you need all in one convenient product. Study notes and cross-references are available throughout making detailed study most convenient. It's possible to place many volumes on your bookshelf but it's much more convenient to have it all in one. The ESV study Bible is what I would recommend to anyone.

B0055CS4UG|5.0|i have had this book for a while now and have made a great number of the recipes, quite a few more than once.  they range from the very easy to prepare, through to things that require a little more effort.<br /><br />the book layout is superb. the photography is excellent. the writing is, of course, an absolute delight. at a time when so many celebrity cooks\chefs have their books ghostwritten (hello mr oliver) it is nice to know that Nigella, with her unique charm and approach, is still the genuine article.  She is the first to say that she is a writer and a home cook. and she is a winner on both counts.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|for rod to do a christmas cd. it was well worth the wait. love it. its a must have for all rod fans. i got the one with the three bonus tracks.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was by far an amazing book no doubt. I had no problems with the pages not working or anything like that. I will admit that the start of the book isn't action-packed, but it gets much more action as it progresses. This time around the battles are about more teamwork and critical thinking than just rushing into battle. That, for me, was really something to respect in this book. Some say that this book isn't as great as the previous ones, but I say it lives up to the potential of the others. There are so many small quests that lead to big outcomes, and not to mention twists and moments full of suspense. I rate this amazing book five stars and recommend it to people like me who love epic battles with interesting ways to win them, and others who like relationships and romance, because this book enters around a lot of that.

B0091Q82L8|5.0|After a night in Leeds on 14 February 1970 The Who loaded up into the van and traveled 50 miles south to the port of Hull for the next night of  performance fury. Kit Lambert was recording both the Leeds and Hull shows for a proposed live album that Who fans had been waiting for many a moon already.<br /><br />The Leeds show had gone over great and a rare encore of \\"Magic Bus\\" was played to a happy crowd there and the show in Hull could only be as good and possibly better than the one played the night before as the band was ready. The show held at City Hall in Hull is the very same set as Leeds and the tapes show Keith came out of the gate with John's tune: \\"Heaven & Hell\\" and made his humble self known right away as a one man wrecking machine behind his drumkit. \\"I Can't Explain\\" is a song The Who could play in their sleep and it carries all the power you would expect from a band that spent most of 1968 & 1969 on tour perfecting the greatest stage act in the business.  A fantastic rendition of: \\"Substitute\\" bleeds right into \\"Happy Jack\\" and Roger's ever deeping voice of 1970 makes and the next selection: \\"I'm a Boy\\" sound new and fresh that lays waste to any studio versions you have already gotten used to.<br /><br />The mini-opera: \\"A Quick One\\" had been in the set for years at this point and this one is as great as the one featured in The Rolling Stones Rock 'N' Roll Circus from December 1968. The band locks in here and the vocals are hitting the mark as well with Keith's fills being just about perfect throughout. In the \\"Ivor\\" section Keith starts a roll you hope won't ever let up and he is nailing this show as he is the biggest thing in the mix. It's been documented that it was impossible to set up the mikes for Keith Moon as If you were closer than a city block to him he would red-line the soundboard levels as soon as he started playing. Keith, wasn't a drummer he was an army of drummers that could roll right over you.<br /><br />\\"Summertime Blues\\" & \\"Shakin' All Over\\" are too close to the Leeds versions and you will think you are back at the show from the night before once again. \\"Shakin\\" has the Spoonful snippet in the middle and we (at last) get an official release of this classic without the normal edit in there that removes \\"Spoonful\\" out of the show. \\"My Generation\\" is a song that The Who had played so many times that it always brought them above their normal excellence to a place in their playing where they locked into flight and soared where no other band could follow them as it just  wasn't possible. The fire in Pete's playing of My Generation at Hull is more frantic and manic that the well-known Leeds version. I already like this Hull version as much as the version from Leeds and any fan of the band should agree as all the magic is right there and in your face just where you need it to be.<br /><br />Disc two contains the \\"Tommy\\" segment of the show that had dominated the live act since May 1969. It's been said the band was growing away from Tommy by this point and didn't want to go near another Opera House in the future but, you cannot tell that was happening from what is presented here as Keith clowns about a bit and it's straight into the: \\"Overture\\" and even without the french horn parts by John it's still as majestic as any Overture can be and now you better hang on as an hour (20 tracks) of \\"Tommy\\" songs are featured in all of their glory. Stripped down and live \\"Tommy\\" brings out the best in The Who as it was meant as a live performance piece when Pete wrote it and this (like \\"Leeds\\") is another example of the greatest live act of the rock era doing what no other group can do. This is the best way to hear \\"Tommy\\" as it gets to breathe new life in concert and this is as great as it gets.<br /><br />\\"Live At Hull - 1970\\" has been called a: \\"Warts 'N' All\\" release and it ain't perfect by any means but rock music cannot be and should not be perfect to be great. Rock music becomes something all-together different when The Who performed live between 1968-1971 as they soar above the planet as the best of the best. Pete, Keith, John & Roger are captured right in the middle of the peak of their playing might right here infront of 1,200 lucky souls in Hull. Any Who fan out there should listen to these two discs as these are great warts of huge and glorious noise...The Who!<br />FIVE STARS!!!erent when The Who performed live between 1968-1971 as they soar above the planet as the best of the best.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I felt disappointment at first when I began reading The Racketeer. But very soon I was aware that a \\"slow\\" beginning doesn't mean a dull book... and the surprise ending made me renew my loyalty to John Grisham novels!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have read a few books of this nature, but this one is the best with the most practical and easy to understand information. I have never been shown how to do squats properly and thought I had poor knees. Now I'm able to do squats and can build my legs with the rest of my body. Well Done Michael, I'll be emailing you in a few months after I've worked on the program.
B008KMHFJY|4.0|Spoiler ALERT!<br /><br />I read the sample and was left wanting, so had to order the whole book.  I really enjoyed the writing, the book was fast pased enough to keep you entertained.  At times I was so frustrated at the characters I could scream, but the story came together nicely.  I would have loved another chapter written in the future as to how it all turned out in the end though.  I want to see that Abby and Travis made it, that their relationship was stronger than anything, and even though they might have &#34;grown up&#34;, a little &#34;fairy tale ending&#34; where they became responsible but were still young at heart, desperately in love and making it would have been great.

B00866H7SS|4.0|After reading Fifty Shades of Grey and making my way through the poor writing, the cliche's and the damned inner goddess and subconscious, Bared to You was refreshing.  The book is well written, the story line has so much going for it and you actually become part of all the emotions and going's on of the book.  I was angry with the heroine, happy with her, and even aroused with her.  Sylvia Day really took you on a good journey on this one.
B007BRJYF2|3.0|This FIND IT game was fun but would especially fun for younger kids.  I lost interest after awhile.  The graphics were pretty though.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|It carried on where Bared to You left off, and the ending, even though a little anticipated had me wondering for days.  The book was once again well written and I love the character growth.  Nothing like a righteous crusade to make you feel like you yourself can conquer the world. I can't wait for the final instalment of this story.  Just a pity it's keeps getting postponed.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|It's been two years since her last album [[ASIN:B003WTE886 Speak Now]] which had a new sound whilst keeping the feeling your listening to the artist you loved since her first release, I was a little worried whether or not she would be able to up her performance in this new album, and I can assure you she has.<br /><br />This album has an awesome mix of different styled tunes, for example if you listen to 'State of Grace', 'Treacherous', 'I Knew You Were Trouble.', 'All Too Well' & 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together', just to name a few, you will realise that sound completely different. There are quite a lot of bands & artists who have albums which most of the songs sound very similar to others, and Taylor manages to give you a different feel for each song you listen too.<br /><br />One thing that has pleased me is that a few of my friends had reluctantly admitted to me that have enjoyed one or two of her new songs, not that it bothered me too much of the quite frequent digs I get for appreciating her music(I know they're in denial ;)), however it's a nice change to hear something positive about an artist you enjoy listening too.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty solid album which I would highly recommend to those who are into pop/country type genre, and especially to those Swift fans out there, however I'm sure you already own it if you are. ;)
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I had a great time watching this movie. Entertaining, sensual and exciting!Perfect to relax with humor an good vibes! I recommand it :-)
0783226063|5.0|It's too bad director David Lynch was in over his head on this one. This was the first (and last) time he worked with a big budget, attempting to adapt a novel that, in paperback form, is over 700 pages. Clocking in at under two-and-a-half hours, \\"Dune\\" is highly compressed and inconsistent in its pacing, and yet it is a deeply compelling and incredibly immersive work of art.<br /><br />\\"Dune\\" opens with Princess Irulan, who provides some basic exposition: It is the year 10,191, and a regressive, feudalistic society known as the Imperium (overseen by Irulan's father, the Emperor) holds a monopoly over a spice known as melange. The spice can only be found on the desert planet Arrakis, or Dune, and exposure to it extends life, consciousness and grants limited prescient powers, which mutants known as guild navigators use to guide star ships through interstellar journeys.<br /><br />House Atreides (say it with me: Uh-tray-dees), who belong to the so-called great houses, poses a threat to the Emperor. He wishes to eliminate them by relocating them to Dune, where they will oversee spice production, at which point their enemies, House Harkonnen, will launch a surprise attack. This plan falls short, however, as the Atreides son, Paul (Kyle MacLachlan), and his mother, Jessica, manage to flee to the desert, where they find sanctuary with the desert people known as the Fremen. Brutal, strong-willed and religiously fanatic, they regard Paul and Jessica as messianic figures. Paul uses his new position of power to train the Fremen to battle against their Harkonnen oppressors, as well as halt spice production so as to force the Emperor to deal with him directly.<br /><br />That is only a basic summary, which doesn't even delve into the massive, destructive sandworms that are of incredible importance to the Fremen culture, the frightening mental powers that Jessica and the sisterhood known as the Bene Gesserit have bestowed upon Paul, the bizarre form of combat known as the \\"weirding way\\" which is an invention of Lynch's, or the fact that both Paul and his mother must consume the poisonous \\"water of life\\" in order to elevate their status among the Fremen. As you can imagine, trying to cram that and so much more into a slightly longer than average running time is exceedingly difficult, and at times it shows rather obviously. Entire chapters of the book are removed or reduced to a single scene. This is in direct contrast to segments of the film that are intentionally slow burning. Despite these fluctuations, Dune rewards its viewers with repeat viewings.<br /><br />In particular, the costume and set design, which is simultaneously futuristic and ancient, is far superior to that of the SyFy Channel miniseries from 2000, and can only truly be appreciated after you've seen the film a good three or four times. Both the sound and music are typical of a Lynch movie; brilliantly memorable with plenty of low hums, although it's a shame that Brian Eno only contributed a single track, the emotionally moving \\"Prophecy Theme.\\" Lynch really went the extra mile to include specific details from the novel, and author Frank Herbert even commented that some of the characters were portrayed more favorably on screen than off. While knowledge of the book certainly helps in appreciating such details, anyone who is a fan of surreal filmmaking will be dazzled by how gracefully \\"Dune\\" has aged, although the green screening and space folding scenes are exceedingly dated. Anyone who enjoys unconventional science fiction will find this picture incredibly satisfying, unless you're the type who nit-picks about creative liberties, or insists on straightforward storytelling. In that case, stick to \\"Star Wars.\\"
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This novel is not thrilling or particularly gripping, but it is quietly wonderful.<br /><br />It stays with you after you finish reading it and it says a lot about life and love. The characters are very well stated and it is easy to understand their mistakes and flaws and recognise them in yourself. It doesn't preach at you not make your own mistakes, but it shows how a great marriage can come undone... and how it can become good again.<br /><br />The story doesn't feature huge plot shifts or cliffhangers but nor is it predictable. I was surprised several times as the story was revealed. I would recommend this book to people who have lived and loved and know that life doesn't always turn out the way you planned, but it doesn't have to stay the same either.
B008JDAC7G|4.0|I liked this OK. I'm a little color blind, so the red/green blocks were irritatingly close for me. Not sure what the objective is supposed to really be at first, but it became a little more fun once I figured out some of the rules.

B004ELSDZK|5.0|As a fan of Hexage games, I was pleasantly surprised to see a puzzle game by the company available on the Kindle Fire HD. Hexage is known for stunning visuals and innovative game-play twists on strategy genres, and they do not disappoint on this title. I also feel that this game has not received enough credit on its Amazon port, as very few people know about it. In an attempt to give an accurate and easy to view review, here are the pros and cons of the puzzle game \\"Totemo HD\\":<br /><br />Pros -<br />*Great Visuals - The graphics in \\"Totemo HD\\" are what puts this puzzle game over the top for me. On the Kindle Fire HD, the visuals are breathtaking due to its usage of the High Definition version. The background visuals, the menu screens, and the spirits themselves bring an eerie feeling to this puzzle game. I would say that these visuals bring a feel reminiscent of the zen puzzle game \\"Quell\\". Your \\"guide\\" and narrator of the game (the totem man; traveling between worlds) is very vibrant and again adds to the ghastly feel of the game.<br />*Easy Controls; Difficult Game - \\"Totemo HD\\" paces the game well as you begin to play it by matching the \\"spirits\\" in pairs of various numbers (2, 3, ect.) in vertical or horizontal lines. It may seem simple, but the addition of other barricades such as star spirits add to the complexity. Some levels are insanely hard and challenging, which I feel is much better than hundreds of easy levels. The 100 levels in this game will keep you going for a while, and the challenge makes it worthwhile in comparison to some puzzle games that are just too easy for a majority of the time.<br />*Great Accompaniment Soundtrack - The Kindle Fire HD's Dolby Digital Plus sound system seems to make great use of Hexage's soundtrack in their games, and the eerie sounds of \\"Totemo HD\\" add to the general feel of the game. With the visuals and music, it creates a wonderfully surreal puzzle playing atmosphere.<br />*Survival Mode - On top of the 100 levels ofpuzzles, a survival mode pressures you to complete endless amounts of puzzles quickly to keep going, and an online leader board makes this even more enjoyable.<br /><br />Cons -<br />*HD Only(?) - As I have a Kindle Fire HD, I have no problem with paying $1.99 to get a stunning HD puzzle game, but I think this may be a negative aspect for regular Kindle Fire users as \\"Totemo HD\\" is the only version of the game in the Amazon App store. Regular Kindle Fire users will not be able to use the HD aspect of this game, sadly, and I would suggest if possible, Hexage, to put a regular port of the game on the marketplace.<br />*Possibly Short - \\"Totemo HD\\" currently has 100 levels. I have heard that it previously had only 62, and I am glad that Hexage expounded on the number of levels. To many, this seems to be too few levels, but the difficulty of them (starting VERY early on) makes it longer than one may expect. Even so, I can't imagine this game taking too long for people to beat, but I would recommend playing survival mode or the story again.<br />*No hints - There is no hint system or \\"pay-to-proceed\\" system using either real money or in game currency (as there is no in game currency). This may turn some people off, since the levels are difficult. For me, this wasn't a problem.<br /><br />Conclusion -<br />\\"Totemo HD\\" is a puzzle game that is hard to pass up. It's challenging, beautiful, and the soundtrack is great for doing these puzzles. I highly recommend this game, and I feel it has gotten far to little recognition on the Amazon Appstore. Check this game out, even if you are only a casual puzzle gamer.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I decided I would wait until I was done with the 3rd book, really write a review. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of reading other peoples views on the book. Which sort of put me out. This book is erotica. It's not trashy, it's not written trashy....I have other erotica books at home, that I have read, and still have, and these books rate up there with me. Granted? The story lines could have been a bit better. Maybe. ^_^ People complained that Anastasia needed to grow up. hmmm... Really? She is just 22 and a virgin too. I mean really, this is her first encounter with actually sex, and of course the encounter had to be with a dom. The confusion is easily made,because she honestly really doesn't have any other experiences to fall back on, to think things through. The Author was using what could have been something that happened in real life. Everyone has history. Everyone has \\"baggage\\"..... The couple just needed to sort it out, and recognize their true feelings. Repetitive sex? well, it IS erotica, what the heck do you expect? I've had read erotica books, that were trashily written, and it was just sleezy from beginning to end. At least this author put in a story line. all in all? I could not put the books down! I read all 3 of them, in less then a week. And that was no skipping either!  I cannot wait until the other book comes out. ^_^ thank you for some good books to read.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my friend's birthday.  She absolutely LOVED it.  She said the wrapping was perfect.  Gift also arrived a day early.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham\\"s books and really enjoyed this one. The story was very well thought out and kept me reading all day. I could not put it down.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This CD completely exceeded my expectations-which were high to say the least. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are on top of the world right now, I look forward to hearing more from these two.
6301752686|5.0|Love it!!! Witch Hazel is a hoot!! Considering when this was made, Disney is/was a genius!!<br />This is the second time I've purchased this video since I'm unable to find the one I've had for years.<br />I'm so happy Amazon had some for sale. Yay for me and mine.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I tried the free version and liked it so much I splurged for the paid premium version. It has neat twists on your standard match three games with frozen and locked cells, other-than rectangular game fields, and puzzles.
B00006CXSS|2.0|Obviously these DVD's had been used at a rental store so several are scratched and don't work. They will either freeze or jus stop. I tried cleaning them and used  another DVD player, I own a Bose Lifestyle system so it plays almost any DVD Netlfix has, but they still didn't work. Best to buy them new. This mini series is excellent and every DVD in the progression of the story is better than the last.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Book was too spastic spent too much time avoiding the issues that the rebels were as bad as the capital.<br /><br />Disappointed
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video will kick your behind. Jillian does not play, but the results that are promised are delivered if you do the work.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Like all books turned into movies the book obviously goes into a lot more detail.  The characters are very likable and the story line easy to follow.  I was pleasantly surprised with the book and continued the second one.  It really hooks you in so you want to read more to see what happens next.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Lets just get this outta the way - I saw this film in the theater and HATED it.<br /><br />I HATED it. Hated everything about it, but mostly, hated the ridiculously STUPID writing. To say that the characters in this film are dumb, one-dimensional, and boring is an understatement. I found myself cussing, literally CUSSING at the screen. I was asking myself questions like 'why the [expletive] would you take your helmet off while on an alien world for the FIRST TIME?!' and 'why in the world are you trying to play with an alien water snake you [long expletive]?!'. I mean this was ANGER. How could these writers be so dense about character and plot logic? How could Ridley Scott go forward with this? Why would Ridley Scott try to [expletive] destroy the franchise he created?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS ISN'T A PREQUEL!? YES IT IS! What's up w/ that last shot?! Why was was it necessary? ...(sigh)<br /><br />My list of questions is too long, too extensive to list in this arena. But the bottom line is that this film is garbage. Beautiful garbage, with some of the best 3D since Cameron's Avatar, beautiful garbage with some of the best visual effects I've ever seen, beautiful garbage with some of the best Red Epic footage ever recorded, but GARBAGE nonetheless.<br /><br />So why did I just drop 30 on something which drew so much vitriolic criticism from many, many people (clearly myself included)? Because it's a great study on how NOT to write characters and story. The film had all the potential in the world to be something quite remarkable had it followed through with better logic. It reminds me of the Matrix Trilogy where 1 & 2 were a wonderful set up for part 3, and we were all left speechless when we realized that the best answer the filmmakers had to all those puzzling, intriguing questions was a big ass gun fight. There is a lot to learn from in this film. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is quite spectacular, and the production design is extremely well done. A few scenes are clever and disturbing, but as a whole, the best thing to be learned from this mess is that logic [expletive] matters.<br /><br />* A quick note - The transfer to BD is good, the sound excellent, the special features (especially the making of doc) are extensive. The 3D BD is the version I purchased.
0385344228|4.0|This book was a little slow to start for me, but about 100 pages in, i couldn't put it down.  It is really a sick story, but you can't stop reading.  I do recommend.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Delightful, mysterious, adventurous, quirky, unusual; there are endless adjectives to describe this book.  It was such a joy to read this book as it wound its way through so many different things and wove them together without feeling forced: books, computers, puzzles, friendship, secret societies, and one tenacious man who won't give up until he's followed his project through to its conclusion.<br /><br />The characters in this book jump off the page right into your mind and after reading it, I find myself wishing I could have spent a bit of time wandering Mr. Penumbra's.  Any book that makes me wish I could wander through the places in the book myself, and brings a smile to my face so many times is a treat and Mr. Penumbra's definitely qualifies.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a really fun game.I didn't give it 5stars because sometimes it freezes midgame. You get to create your town with creature comforts of the settlers. days. Great for any age!!!
B0043OUZW2|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase, in my opinion she is one of the better guitar player out there
B0018QCXGY|5.0|I just saw this movie last night, and was prepared to hate it from all the reviews I had read, as well as the hand held filming method.....BUT I loved it!  It pulled me in right away, and it was so realistic and well done and scary!  I watched it at a friends house, and I am going out today to buy it!  So unless you are boxed in to the standard routine status quo movie format, you are going to really enjoy this movie!
B00701L5XS|5.0|Edited 4/8/2014:  I saw that the developer had removed the issues with the app, so I went ahead and purchased it again on the hopes that the comments were true.  Glad to say they were, not only that the app is even better then before.  If you previously deleted this app because of the spyware in it I recommend giving it a second try, you will be happy you did.<br /><br />Orig Review 11/6/2012:  Had an older version of this product and liked it very much, would have given it 4 stars.  However when it came time to update it asked for many more permissions then shown on the Amazon page for the app.  I no longer recommend this app.
B009O5CLZY|4.0|Really good game especially for the price. I'm not one of those people who thinks they shouldn't be charged for games.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|everything you might want and more in a note app. My own use barely scratches the surface of what's possible with this program.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I heard all hype about the movie so I decided to read the books. I wasn't disappointed, I really enjoyed all the books. I read through them all and couldn't put the Kindle down. Only complaint is after reading them all I went to see the first movie... Compared to the books, that was disappointing.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I enjoyed reading The Racketeer.  It reminded me of The Firm and I loved that book too!  The twist was not predictable which made it a real page turner.  I read the book in two days!
B009157BWU|4.0|I usually love nature type shows/movies so I pretty much figured I'd enjoy this. Happy to say I wasn't disappointed. Great movie and worth watching!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really like this game it is fun and easy. I would refer a friend to play this game. yep
B003O86FMW|5.0|I heard all hype about the movie so I decided to read the books. I wasn't disappointed, I really enjoyed all the books. I read through them all and couldn't put the Kindle down. Only complaint is after reading them all I went to see the first movie... Compared to the books, that was disappointing.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I was hooked at the beginning of the game as soon as I saw elementalize dragons and I knew this was the game for me at that very moment. this game is perfect for just about anyone who loves dragons

B0096HIEE2|3.0|This movie was ok at best. It seemed like a movie with a low budget. If your wanting to see it, I would suggest rent not buy.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I love these Dr Suess movies they've been coming out with. This was a great animated movie.. Really enjoyed watching!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Good read, had just enough twist and turns to keep the reader interested. Definitely not as good as the \\"Lion's Game\\" but nice sequell.
B004MYF4SS|2.0|Although the author has a sense of time and place the many descriptions  do not move nor capture the imagination.  The extraordinary bleak beauty of the island is lost and reads more like a mundane travelogue.  As a crime novel there are some contrived , gaping holes of credibility. Characterization does not go beneath the skin and I felt i did not know these people.<br />Their histories were clear but not their deep feelings and relationships nor their real inner motivations.  e
B001OSIV62|4.0|Good documentary about an illegal act. It was pretty amazing how they pulled the stunt off. Sort of slow at times.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|A great movie if you want to get an idea of how different cultures raise their children. It's quite educational.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved Bared to You but I loved this one more.  The characters become more real and you are pulled into their lives.  I cannot say enough...you will not be disappointed!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun fun n my son stays busy with it... it is what it is, n hasn't frozen or had an issue colorful n keeps your attention!
0061714402|5.0|I love it. It is absolutely perfect. Inspirational. Everyone can find something in it. A must read. Very grateful to Dave Mustaine for sharing his amazing story with the rest of the world, and his sincere style. Very lucky to have the extra chapter. The print is very nice.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|I got this game because it was the free app of the day.  I didn't really think I would like it. Surprisingly it was super fun. It is a fun puzzle game. I'm only eleven and it gets harder when you get to the middle of the game.
0007324103|5.0|I love it. It is absolutely perfect. Inspirational. Everyone can find something in it. A must read. Very grateful to Dave Mustaine for sharing his amazing story with the rest of the world, and his sincere style.
0062082353|4.0|Good stories, but lacked a lot of real in-depth information. I would have preferred that there was more detail into his training and then to the different missions, but overall it was a good read.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Like any Megadeth album, Thirteen is a must have. It is pure Megadeth. You can't afford to miss it. Every song is worth it. It is another important album in Megadeth's history.
B0078ZYXSA|5.0|I'm about the biggest Dexys fan in the world and I had no idea this album existed until a couple weeks ago. I'm watching a music video on Youtube called \\"The English Dandy\\", it ends and I'm recommended to a song by Dexys I've never heard of called \\"Incapable of Love\\"!?<br /><br />I own the original 3 Dexys albums, as well as live releases, and Kevin's 2 solo efforts (the second of which is fabulous despite what you might have heard, \\"My Beauty\\"). I'd say this new record sounds as if it were recorded just a few years after their third, as opposed to 27 years after. Kevin's voice is still in fine form, and the atmosphere on the album reminds me of that from their third effort, \\"Don't Stand Me Down\\". Definitely a fine follow-up to the original 3.
0810994550|5.0|Young man turned eight and his father wanted him to read some fiction.  This did the trick, he devoured the book.
B009VB97EY|4.0|Magic Mike got a lot of hype for being a 'stripper film'. However, watching the actual film, it's very deeply thought out.<br /><br />Magic Mike doesn't want to glamourise stripping, nor does it want to be critical, it just wants to portray modern culture as it really is. The film centres around Mike and Adam. Mike is 30, seasoned and confident, while Adam is 18, lacks life experience and is a petty thief. Mike takes Adam under his wing in the stripping industry, teaching him 'techniques'. They work for a guy in a cowboy hat called 'Dallas'. They meet some very interesting people.<br /><br />The movie is a good reflection of society as it is today, with people obsessed about golden bodies in night clubs, appearance and celebrity; not trying to give the culture a bad image, just trying to portray things as they really are.<br /><br />The most interesting scene, however, is when Mike tries to get a loan off the bank. He tries all his smooth-talk and techniques on the lady behind the counter, but none of it works.<br /><br />Overall, an interesting movie where everyone gets what they, want, without a queasy happy ending, well, almost. I'd rate it 7 or 8 out of 10. Good quality viewing.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|This little gadget is awesome. Couple it with a Micro-SD card and It makes for some of the smallest USB drives ever. It's extremely compact and a great because I have several Micro-SD cards and laying around and I prefer this setup over a bigger USB drive.<br /><br />I've had few others but they ended up stopping working for no apparent reason.<br /><br />These work well so far so I give them 5 stars and recommend them!
B009B8YZKS|5.0|This is one of the best web series based on a video game I have watched. I was enthralled by it the entire time. Also, it is really cool to see live action Spartan II doing some work. I was a bit disappointed they used someone else to dub Master Chief's voice but it wasn't a bad job.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|The special effects and imagery were really great. You will enjoy that part unless you are not a fan of sorcery stuff. The story was fairly incomplete. I wasn't connected to any of the character and hardly any of the relationships had merit.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story moves along. Not as fast as the recent book \\"Paroled\\".  Both deal with someone getting out of prison.
B00886XQO0|1.0|Was probably said about 10 times while I tried watching a short video on lower volume, while in an xbox party, with these things.<br /><br />When the headset first arrived, I didn't care for the sound or feel of it (it blocks out too much external noise even when the volume is off).  Explosions rocked out in one ear while the other side went dead and the when I tried using different settings, they sounded fake and \\"off\\"  The internal battery is a huge inconvenience.  I had used Eneloop rechargeables on my old TB without problems, but the power saver in this headset is a NIGHTMARE.  And, unless you listen to stuff really loud ALL THE TIME (and this includes movies, videos, etc.) or are constantly talking, it shuts itself off after about 10-20 seconds of what it considers silence.  (There's no canceling that feature either, and it sucks.) I had this happen with TWO different headsets after Turtle Beach told me it was defective and I should have it returned to them (at my expense) for repairs.  I didn't do that, I simply returned the first one to Amazon and tried it again.  The replacement failed as well and did the same thing, so it's either across all Tangos or Turtle Beach doesn't even know this thing blows.<br /><br />In comparison, I had been using a TB Delta the past year with few complaints.  (I just didn't use features that needed to be changed via USB cable.)  I was so excited when I heard the Tango was coming out I preordered it ASAP but  this thing Tango thing is a piece of junk.<br /><br />In the end, I returned them both and went with an XP500 (since it's basically the Delta) and I'm pleased with it's performance and not having to worry about the headset shutting itself off.  I am still using my Delta, so it's holding up very well.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|If I could have one wish come true, it would be that I will enjoy this Motion Picture, as much as I enjoy this Music.<br /><br />I awoke this morning with John Williams' rousing score for \\"The Cowboys\\" in my head.  That's a beautiful theme and I hadn't hummed it in many months, but knew every note by heart.  There hasn't been a day since June 1977 that I haven't had at least one of John Williams' scores playing in my head, or hummed on my lips.<br /><br />\\"Lincoln.\\"  This is music which should be listened to in the evening hours.  In a dimly lit room, shades drawn.  With a glass of wine and candles lit, you'll soon fall into an ambiance of love and remembrance, traveling back 148 years to 1864.<br /><br />Now about Lincoln, the man.  We know how the story ends.  It's tragic.  Lincoln was a tragic figure in American history.  A great leader, wise and courageous and a mystery of how he comported himself and sounded in real life.  Maestro Williams segregates (forgive the pun) Lincoln in a magnificent aura of haunting melodies to portray the President as a hallowed figure, and a leader who loved America.  This is important in fully appreciating this masterful score.<br /><br />Performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, the music is utterly flawless and beautiful.  Shawn Murphy has been recording and mixing John Williams' scores for many years, and he deserves much appreciation from Williams' fans when it comes to tweaking digital music to perfection.  Thank you, Shawn!<br /><br />\\"The People's House\\" reminded me just a little of some passages from \\"NIXON\\" with a fading solo trumpet, however this is all original and different from anything I have heard from Maestro Williams.  It is unbelievably new and you will be moved by it.<br /><br />\\"Getting Out The Vote\\" will have you tapping your toes to the beat of this great little fiddle melody.  This is wonderfully folksy, you're ears will be grinning from this one.<br /><br />\\"The Southern Delegation And The Dream.\\"  An incredibly moving and fanciful selection.  Nobody does it better than the Maestro.<br /><br />\\"The Race To The House.\\"  A period-piece, country lively and city robust that makes me want to see the movie.<br /><br />If there is anything missing in this score (but perfectly understandable) is the scarce use of percussion instruments.  In all of the symphonic universe, John Williams is the greatest composer who ever lived to master the use of the percussion section in an orchestra.  He must have inherited this from his father.  But \\"Call To Muster\\" is satisfying in this regard, and the chorus singing \\"Battle Cry Of Freedom,\\" will make the hair on the back of your neck stand at attention!<br /><br />Perhaps something else missing which I would have loved to hear, would have been the Chicago Symphony and Chorus, conducted by the Maestro doing \\"The Battle Hymn Of The Republic,\\" included as a bonus on this CD.  Rats.<br /><br />\\"With Malice Toward None\\" (Symphony) and \\"Freedom's Call.\\"  After listening, you'll be proud that you are an American.  Incredible music.<br /><br />\\"With Malice Toward None\\" (Piano solo) will touch your heart, and bring visions of a time when this nation was young and needed a leader like Lincoln, to give it a new way of dealing with giving liberty and justice to all.<br /><br />Perhaps this explains why I woke with the theme for \\"The Cowboys\\" in my head this morning.  God Bless America and Maestro John Williams!<br /><br />You'll love this music.  :-)  Keith Andersonm.\\"  An incredibly moving and fanciful selection.

B0000669JL|5.0|I ordered this CD mainly because I actually wanted to support the artist instead of illegally downloading it. I think it sort of wraps up all of Marley's accomplishments.
0316228532|5.0|I think it was very much her style. Yes it unique and dark. But real life doesn't always have a happy ending so I enjoy the realism that it portrays. I have a hard time getting into books like this but I loved this one. Great start into her adult line.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|An interesting story line with many twists and turns, but a bit tedious.  Slow, not much action, more<br />cerebral than fast paced.  A good novel, surely not a great one.
B001G70M6S|5.0|When I heard that Fujifilm was making film for my Polaroid Land Camera I had to purchase some! Every picture turned out flawlessly! You won't be upset.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|The Bat by Jo Nesbo. This is a great story set in Australia from this talented Norwegian crime writer. Really enjoyed it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I liked the way the author takes you with her in words, when you may not go there physically. :)
B00A202A3I|4.0|This turned out much better than I expected, and is one of the better shows currently on cable. If your hesitant because you think the zombie genre is stupid (and mostly is) don't be, you'll be surprised.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|How far would you go to get out of prison? What would you do to clear your name? After you cut your deal with the government and have given up all that you knew and were, this new world is more dangerous than what you left behind. Grisham does it again.  Is the danger from the courts, our law enforcement groups, or the criminal world out for revenge.  Perhaps our \\"felon\\" is really the one setting all up for the ironic twist.  Just when you think you know what is happening, the master story teller knocks you again for a loop.  Didn't see this coming at all. Enjoyed not just the tale but the spider web of setting up and understanding the costs of witness protection.
B008J9EYFG|3.0|in anticipation of Ms. Orton's solo acoustic performance locally, i listened to this release at least twelve times, including four times on the day of the show. unfortunately, nothing stuck, which was quite a surprise given how memorable her previous offerings had proved. Overall, this is a pedestrian effort.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Fantastic. Beautiful. Chilling.<br /><br />Many more words can describe the entire presentation, from the best version of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" I've ever seen (performed by the incredibly talented Lea Salonga) to the fantastic finale of One More Day (performed by both the original cast and the 25th anniversary cast) is absolutely mindblowing. If you love good music, you owe it to yourself to get this Blu-Ray and enjoy the wonder that is Les Mis&eacute;rables.<br /><br />Superb.
031618201X|4.0|I was thrilled to see my beloved Parasol Protectorate in manga form. The story is well thought out, and transferred nicely into manga form. I've read other books that Rem has done the artwork for, and I'm always pleasantly surprised. I love seeing Alexia's clothes! Period clothes are always lovely, and the fashion in the manga did not disappoint. I'm a big lover of \\"fashion\\" manga (Paradise Kiss, Nana, etc.) but I had yet to find steampunk in manga form. I was pleasantly surprised. It did skim over the original story a bit, but it's manga and has limited potential for stories without being twice as long as the novel. It's always nice to see someone else's visions of the characters as I see them. They were spot on, and I'm pleased that the language of the time period stayed true with the manga as well. If you want something a little different from the usual manga fanfare, this is definitely one to check out.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham is always a good read, even when - as in this case - things got a little choppy.  The story line and twists had great potential, but it felt a little like they had been written at two different times, with a long vacation in between.  The break in the middle had me doing some head scratching for a while.  Still, if you enjoy Grisham's easy, familiar style, you won't be totally disappointed. It took some heavy thinking to lay this out, without giving everything away too soon.  Will I buy the next Grisham to come out?  You bet!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love Grisham and this book is typical. Once started I couldn't put it down. The characters carried the story well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun and addicting! It has a variety of levels. Even my kids love it! The only thing I don't like is it takes forever to get enough points to unlock the upper levels.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I am both a nurse and someone who has read other \\"life after life\\" books.  So this book was preaching to the choir.  there is a lot of medical jargon but it almost all explained.  The end of the book's emphasis on physics and consciousness was not of interest to me.  But I understood that Dr. Alexander was trying to convince other scientists.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I actually sat through this whole movie expecting it would get good at some point, but it never did. Why did Tom Cruise do this movie? All the actors did a great job, but the movie should never have been green lighted by the studio. How many great movies were put on hold so this stupid flick could get made? It could possibly have been good if they would have use origional music, or they could have used the real rock bands in the movie. Tom Cruise is no John Bon Jovie or Steve Perry. If you want a good rock movie? see Rock Star or Detroit Rock City.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I was helping a neighbor of mine with her English 101 class - and she had the read The Hunger Games. So I read it, too. I'm no YA but I remember back to what I was reading when I was young - a lot of Ray Bradbury, to name one - and I found this a thrilling YA book. So thrilling that I consumed the remainder of the trilogy. The film was very, very good - very enjoyable - and stands on it's own even if you haven't read the book. Terrific casting, acting and directing. Kudos, too, must go to the costume and set designers for their view of the 'Capitol' - just the over-the-top look that you imagine when reading the book. All in all, a 5-star movie.
B000035P7X|5.0|Don't Look Back is one of the best and most inspiring music documentaries I have ever seen.  It captures a young Bob Dylan during the height of his fame on a three week tour of London in 1965.  The performance footage in this film is some of the last of Dylan before he went electric months later at Newport Folk Festival.  The director, D.A. Pennebaker manages to remain a quiet, fly on the wall, throughout the entire film.  To any filmmaker or video artist who works in an observant, cinema verite style, this film is your bible.  Pennebaker does not interfere with any of the scenes or people.  He does not hold any interviews with Dylan, friends, or fans.  He just stands there with his camera, quietly soaking up everything like a sponge.  There are appearances made by Joan Baez, who at the time was seeing Dylan, Alan Price, right after he left The Animals, and Donovan, who appears to intimidate Dylan at certain moments in the film.  The film also includes famous beat poet, Allen Ginsberg, and Dylan's sidekick throughout the tour, Bob Neuwirth.  Pennebaker does not show as much concert footage as you think most music documentaries would, however, he includes more music than any music documentary ever could.  When Dylan isn't on stage performing, he is in the hotel room writing or singing a song, whether it be by himself or in the company of ten other people, including Donovan.  It is extremely inspiring to see how Dylan's life is simply all about music and how truly passionate he is about it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story is an interesting concept.  This book was a quick read but excellent.  I watched the movie first and was really excited to read the books.  Like most, the book was better and I couldn't stop reading it. Be prepared with the second and third book - - you'll need them!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I'm a John Grisham fanatic.  I thought this book started ok; it was a page turner for a while.  But the closer I got to the end, the more random things became. Nearly haphazard and unbelievable. Finally, the end was abrupt and predictable. I think Grisham is churning the books out too fast. Take a little more time with your next one, please!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A great read for all, but especially for people experiencing difficult/troublesome times in their lives. Dare to dream and achieve your dreams, it can be done.[[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]]
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|love it me and my six year old love playing this game. I played the original on the apple II this one is much better.
B006X8GFBQ|4.0|This was an enjoyable read but didn't grab me quite like some of his other books (Revelation Space, Chasm City etc). However I liked it enough to want to read the sequel(s).
B007THA4FI|4.0|I think the story is great, it takes some time to get properly familiar with all the persons. True to her style J.K.Rowling has a very large number of characters and they are described in every detail. Great but it slao makes the beginning of the book a bit jumbled.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I love Grisham books.  The different angles, the tension, the legal authority.  So I waited with anticipation for The Racketeer.  It started out pretty good; I felt the writing was a little boring, but continued to give it the benefit of doubt because the concept seemed interesting.  By mid-book, however, I gave it up. I was struggling, but one sentence finished me.  The hero is successful in his escape, but \\"someone was watching the money.\\"  Really?  The feds handle witness protection programs all the time; if someone is able to find people by following the money paid out, it would be all over. My husband also started it, but just couldn't be bothered finishing it.<br /><br />Never thought I would give this author a bad review, but there it is.
0345803507|3.0|I READ ALL THREE BOOKS THE FIRST ONE WAS  KIND OF SLOW WHEN I STARTED IT I STARED TO PUT IT DOWN BUT AS I READ ON IT GOT MUCH BETTER SO I FINISHED IT THEN I  GOT BOOK TWO I LOVED IT I  READ THAT IN TWO DAYS THEN I  GOT BOOK THREE IT WAS OK SHE WAS KIND OF SILLY IN IT SHE HAD HIM BUT WASNT HAPPY WITH THAT.BUT IN BOOK ONE IT SAID THAT HE HAD DREDS IN  HIS HAIR AND BOOK TWO SAID SHE GAVE HIM A HAIR CUT AND IT WAS STRAIGHT.  THE BOOK NEVER SAD WAY SHE NEVER THOUGHT SHE WAS PRETTY OR SHE REALLY DIDNT LIKE HERSELF
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the game, real glad MobilityWare put this one out for us &quot;classicists&quot;.  The ability to select winning hands improves skills. Thank you!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|As with the first two in the series it is a bit difficult to deal with the Swedish names of people and towns.  A little slow in the beginning but well worth the time it takes to get through.  Maybe a bit too much government background of Sweden (am sure if you are from Sweden the dynamics of the government would be more interesting) but a winner of a book in the end.  Glad I took the time to finish it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|No problems, just fun on my phone. I do wish it included a couple more types of the game for more variety.
0060873175|1.0|I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton.  I have been reading the latest \\"Micro\\", written by Richard Preston.  It is the first book I will not finish, I have read about 2/3rds of it and it is soooo appalling that I can't read any more.  It is so bad i am going to throw it away, I could not give it to a friend. The standard of writing is nowhere near Michael's and it is unashamedly designed to be a screenplay based on a ridiculous premise of people being shrunk to half an inch high.  I am a big sci-fi fan but this story is just plane stupid, save your money!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Campy... like the TV series but not quite so subtle.  Which possibly makes it more satisfying for those of us who rushed to get home by 4:00 PM every weekday to drink in the melodrama like blood.  The tea and TV would be hot and waiting for us (thanks Mum!) and my sisters and brothers and I would huddle on the living room rug.  Strongly recommended!
B000FC1HBY|3.0|I know that a lot of reviewers are raving about his series but unfortunately, I'm not really seeing the appeal. I feel that the writing is a bit uneven, like Martin is trying to find his writing style or voice. It's certainly dark but you'd expect at least one character with some redeeming qualities. The \\"good\\" characters are bland and uninteresting. The bad guys definitely have more depth, but most of them are a bit one sided.<br /><br />I will continue reading, though. It's better than most. He's no Lawhead,though. Or Tolkien. Or any of the other authors that Martin borrows from as he finds his voice.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I feel like people that give poor reviews for this and similar products don't follow the directions meticulously and end up with poor results.  I've cut a good number of bottles with it now, and not every one turns out perfect, but on the whole, it works when I do the work to use it right.
B0063IH60K|2.0|The game is so so, but the advertisements that precede each game is very annoying.  The turning of one card at a time also proves to be boring.
B000VSYDRM|2.0|Despite fascinating decors and costumes, not to mention the ever-inspiring presence of Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman, this is the kind of movie that those with a strong conscience or sense of good writing style will hate. If you thought the fifth season of Breaking Bad was disappointing, then you will feel let down with this movie.<br /><br />The personality of Grenouille (frog) gives us absolutely nothing to invest in or care about (not even his nose or talent). No line is drawn between his abandonment as an orphan and his curiously detached state. In a nutshell, this is not the reason for which fairy tales were created.<br /><br />If the tale had been told in the voice of Alan Rickman, as the father of the beautiful daughter we see towards the end of the story, and if Rickman's character had, during the course of the narration, done analysis on the difference between a child who is abandoned and a child who is loved, perhaps the story would have made a little sense. But it does not. Even the massive orgy in Grasse doesn't make that much sense and the viewer cannot help but wonder, \\"What about those with damaged olfactory senses?\\" After all, not everyone can smell your perfume. It was interesting but I was unhappy that I invested the time it took to watch this movie.  I was glad Grenouille died at the end, but I wish all his bones could have been broken first.  He was not even human. Who wants perfume created by someone without a heart?
B00348K1I6|2.0|I liked the movie a lot, but the streaming was choppy, and we didn't receive HD quality for the majority of the movie. Twice we had to stop the movie and go back to the Amazon interface to start to movie over again to get it to play through.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Building on their success from their debut album, Sigh No More, Babel continues their hard-hitting British folk rock tradition. Just about every song is wonderful, which is more than I can say for most recent albums I've purchased.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I like this game it is like restaurant story and fashion story. I play these games a lot can't helpnit. ink addicted.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Very cool dragons, well made. Takes some time to raise dragons as the farming is not well thought out. $650 for 50 pieces of fruit and the level 5 dragons take all 50 at a shot and needs 5 or 6 feedings for level 6. It takes 1 hour to harvest each time.  Upgrades are pricey as is the larger farms. If you have a lot a dragons it gets pricey. Other then that I am having fun playing and visiting the other isles and seeing all the cool possibilities.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|It freezes up every time I try to use maps. Then it paralyzed itself until battery fully exhausted.<br />I have to wait few hours, then recharge the battery and turn it on. It's disgusting.
B009KUANWG|4.0|There is no question that Adele has had one of the most infectious songs to have ever came out of the industry from the past few years. Rolling In The Deep, definitely showed that last year, as the Song Of The Year at The Grammy Awards. But nevertheless, when she was tapped to do the leading song for the James Bond film Skyfall, I was skeptical if she could still sing after her vocal incidents that hurt her touring for 21. The song is definitely a classic ballad that still shows that Adele still can sing, and it definitely holds up with the best James Bond songs from Goldeneye by Tina Turner, to Tomorrow Never dies from Sheryl Crow. This is a great download for anyone that loves Adele, or is looking for the next great song from the movies.<br /><br />Song: B 1/2+
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Me encanto . Lo unico malo que la 3ra parte tardara mucho en salir, deberían adelantarlo por favoooooorr editores, no nos dejen en ascuas
B004OZZ624|5.0|understandable plot with good suspense.  Kept me excited and entertained, all you ask for in a movie..loved it. the end..ha.
B008NB0SQO|1.0|I am bitterly disappointed in this release. I grew up watching this movie, and it's always been my favorite version of A Christmas Carol. However, they left out the song that Belle sings (for some unknown reason), and it makes no sense without it. They reprise the song at the end, so I don't understand who in their right mind decided it made sense to leave it out. Of course, I didn't realize this until after I got it home and opened it, so I can't even take it back now. I just wish there was a way I could get my money back. Completely not worth it to me. :(
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am very impressed with this app! The only thing I have found that I can't do on it, that I can on my desktop, is edit a board or pin. Other than that works just the same and I rarely use the desktop version of Pinterest. I also love that it pops up a warning before you go to a website that has been reported as SPAM.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|If you like Hunger Games Trilogy, try this one too!  This is a must read book/series!!  Love it!<br />This is one of those books that you cant put down.  Easy read with a lot of excitement!
B008MAI0WK|5.0|Great book to start with. cover all the important features of the the board.<br />A Must have as a text book but also as a reference book for later use!
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I have to give it a 3 star because I'm still on the fence about the movie. Not interested in the ..these are our creators and no God aspect. That's a load in itself. There were things left unanswered as several people stated. I didn't know this was a trilogy so maybe it will explain more. I wanted to give it 5 stars for the cinematography. I loved the big human dudes. I was not expecting those guys to come out of the suits, right? I liked the setting and how things were played out. I could have done without what Shaw had to do in the surgery room and we all know what I'm talking about. I squirmed around for some time after that and her running around the best she could after all of that! Uggg! At least she took care of it :) for the most part. I can't wait to see the next 2 if that is what he is doing to see if she gets where she is going and there are answers to her questions and ours! Anyway, to each his own.. enjoy or not.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just like the arcade but free . Fun and relaxing and your coins regenerate -don't buy them just wait. The higher you get in levels the more you get per time frame.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|Mutant road rage is always a good way to kill time. Blowing up stuff is also a plus. I give it 1.4 thumbs up.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|flowing, intelligent AND RICH CHARACTERS.  THE FIRST TWO WERE THE BEST, THIS ONE AS WELL AS THOSE LEAVE YOU WANTING FOR MORE.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I downloaded this as a means to kill some time while I was going through a rough patch and this certainly helped take my mind off of things. This is one of two of ten games that I did nnot delete off my Kindle.
B0089J29C6|5.0|Finally a top quality version of the early Cineascope film, and my favorie Marilyn Monroe film. Back in those days the filmakers used the whole wide screen image, and this film suffered from many TV showing that were pan & scan, with only one or two of the stars on the screen at a time. Blu-Ray is causing many of these films to be reissued in wide screen close to the original format, if not dead on.  Some problems with the image due to the state of the art at that time, but it is a fine version, and very enjoyable. Lauren Bacall & Betty Grable in the fine cast all do a great job
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really enjoy this game the graphics r great.the dragons r so cool as they mature.beautiful.would and have recommended this to friend and family.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|Save your money, this game is so hard to set up the scenarios, that it just is not worth it. Grey pieces are too rounded and NEVER stand up like they show in the cards. If you think Jenga is a hard balance game, you will hate this. Love the idea, the execution sucks. Wish I could get my money back. Sorry Mattel, this one stinks.
B0092C2X7U|1.0|I've been trying my best to like this game. I really have. It hasn't been easy. To make things easier I've done such things as slapping myself whenever I fail, or banging my head against the wall.<br /><br /> I might be a little bit dizzy by now but oh well. This kind of thing is worth it after all. The adoring public needs to know the truth about things like this. Okay. Let me get my head clear. Right. Here we go.<br /><br />This game barely qualifies to even be called one. The opening starts with a disclaimer saying not to try the things shown in the game because they are done by a professional. Or something like that.<br /><br />Perhaps our protagonist is a distant relative of QWOP. I mean, the controls are slightly better than QWOP's, but perhaps only by a very thin margin. Maybe an entire yoctometer of difference. Also, while he moves like a marrionette, our protagonist maintains a calm grimace throughout the entire ordeal.<br /><br />When you tap the button to make him perform, he moves like a man possessed, perhaps by the spirit of an angry ancestor that hates gymnastics, and all things graceful. Then again, perhaps it's impossible for him to be possessed.<br /><br />His face is so utterly soul less, and yet despite being able to harm himself severely in un-funny Jackass-esque routines, he stoicly continues his quest for the perfect attempt at back-flipping in a manner that even actual robots can perform with more grace.<br /><br />There isn't any real pressure to perform here. No audience to cheer our protagonist on. He's not in it for success. He's not in it for glory. He's in it for the pain. He must be a masochist or something. Just like anyone who would actually pay for this horrible mess of a game.<br /><br />Pro tip for developers: If you're trying to use the App of the day to get good exposure for your games, garbage like this, is NOT the way to do it.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Totally not what I expected. If your looking for the generic Snow White movie, this isn't it. Great movie. Two thumbs up.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Most of the apps i downloaded were just cheap wanna be famous apps. but this app is AWESOME!!!!!!i love it i give it 5 stars. Best game EVER
B007SGLZP8|3.0|An  interesting  story. A  little  \\"Off  the  Wall\\"  for  a  John  Grisham  novel. Lots  of  imagination to develop a story  such as  this. It was  enjoyable to read  and  try  to  outguess  Mr. Grisham !!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Enjoy playing with dragons.  So far no technical issues. Very easy to use and understand. Is fun for all ages.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A great plot as usual with Grisham, but hard to follow because the plot moved so fast and I was reading as fast to keep up with it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great read by the master of legal thrillers.  Grisham's fertile mind once again takes us on a thrilling and fun romp. Couldn't put it down[[ASIN:0385535147 The Racketeer]].
0307352145|5.0|After reading an interview to Susan Cain in Scientific American, I got interested in this book and I bought it from Amazon.<br />The ideas and facts that Susan Cain presents are very powerful, especially when some myths are dismissed; like the group brainstorming, the committees, \\"buzzing\\" and other not useful group activities<br />I understand myself better after knowing the \\"reward sensitivity\\" behavior, which is not one of my attitudes. \\"Deliberate practice\\" and \\"Free Trait Theory\\" are part of my day-to-day, however I didn't know by these names but I understand them now.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|So far, so good - haven't had a chance to use it much but I know several friends who LOVE it - Thanks!!
B009JNXK88|4.0|great game old school. reminds me of the good old days when you had to enter things like up up down down left right left right b a b a start. some of the levels get pretty hard and beating the time clock to get 3 stars seems impossible but fun anyway
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Game is fun!  You can loose track of time while playing it.  Good idea to be able to try a free one, that way you can know before buying other ones to know if it's something you like to do.
B008FGQKTG|5.0|I didn't think this would be a show I would get hooked to, but I couldn't stop once I started!!
B008NEVP1S|4.0|Aimee Mann has been ploughing her fruitful fallow for many years now and this latest outpouring maintains those triumphant standards. The 70s synths that embroider these songs of love and loss might seem distracting at first but the tunes remain as toe-tappingly memorable as ever, the playing as vibrant (most notably on the standout track Soon Enough, where the guitar solo is an absolute cracker) and the sentiments every bit as suited to these troubling times. Don't neglect this minor masterpiece.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book ever it's a nice book with a lot of adventures I hope every body like it and rates it 5 stars
B004L35GAQ|5.0|Can't seem to take this album out of my cd player in my car, lots of good songs and no bad ones. Awesome variety of sound too, no 2 songs are alike
B008B3MZMY|5.0|This DVD is amazing. Recorded at a Paris show in December 1st, 1979, it features Supertramop as a well-oiled machine, a band so good and tight that every song performed here is a winner.<br /><br />What you have here is not a rock band properly. Supertramp always navigated through the pop world according to their own manual. Along the way,k they created marvellous hit singles, but most of them little masterpieces on their own.<br /><br />Paris '79 is very, very good Funny that drummer Bob seldom is shot clearly, and according to what people here say he was the one who had the master tapes in his possession all these years!<br /><br />As for the Davies/Hodgson bickering, could not care less about it.
B000W089XS|4.0|I was so excited to receive my product in the mail. However, once I opened the package, I noticed that the DVD cover was not the one that I had picked. On the Amazon website, I saw that the DVD had 2 different versions of the cover (one where Marilyn Monroe is wearing an orange dress and another where she is wearing a purple dress). I chose the one where she is wearing a purple dress (and the picture even showed up on my order confirmation form so I expected to receive that specific one). I ended up getting the other cover version. I was not really upset because it really is not a big deal, but it wasn't what I expected so I was more confused and disappointed than upset. I decided to e-mail the sender of the product just to see if there was some way of fixing the mistake. Unfortunately, they told me that they ran out of the DVD with the specific cover that I wanted so they said that they would give me a full refund. I totally did not expect them to do that, but I was very appreciative. They showed very prompt customer service.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show.  Always the unexpected happening.  Always leave you with a cliff hanger at the end, making you always want to see the next one NOW!!!
B0095R64AO|4.0|First of all Emily Blunt is absolutely gorgeous.  Second of all, was a good movie, really liked to story.  Good to see Jason Segal was one of the writers and he's doing great.<br /><br />Again Emily Blunt, she is a natural beauty in all sense of the phrase.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|An extraordinary read.  At this time when DNA traces or videos solve crimes at the speed of light, it is great to read how Holmes can come up with solutions that are clearly logical once he presents them, but you probably wouldn't think of them if you had to solve the mystery yourself.  Plus, and most important, the book has ALL Holmes novels and stories written by Conan Doyle in one book.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I haven't got it for my kindle fire yet but I've tried it on my cousins ipod and it works perfectly. it does cost a lot and its not like the Pc version but hey, they'll probably make some updates soon and if you think it costs too much just buy blockstory. I have it and it's extremely. close to minecraft and it costs less.one version of it is FREE!  but it doesn't save . the other version does. I hope you liked this review.<br /><br />your awesome friend,<br />fashionable fiona
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I wish this book was required reading for every American in high school. Too few of our youth know the realites of Communism. They take democracy for granted.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I was sad when it was over and can't wait for the next one!
B009FBX5M0|1.0|When Chris Cornell decided not to let EON have the title track to Casino Royale, we all thought it was crap. Now, Adele's title track is nowhere, not on the soundtrack, score or 50th anniversary collection. What happened to the great tradition of James Bond music being available for the people?
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|One of my favorites, it is quite a challenge to complete some of the levels. I can't wait to see what happens at the end.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I had heard great things about this book and wanted to read it on my Kindle before seeing the movie. Perhaps I was not the target audience. It was ok if not a little depressing. I agree with other readers that Sam's discussion with Charlie towards the end of the book was terrific and did sum up what I had been thinking as the reader. However, (SPOILER ALERT) the ending was truly disturbing and although we know Charlie has some emotional or mental illness, I was not at all prepared for the last part. I would recommend it for a book club because it might be fun to reminisce about about being a teenager, but I would not recommend it as a personal read.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|After charging to full capacity, the mouse would not work.<br />We tried a number of times, taking out and putting the batteries back in, but no luck.<br />Soon as I would put it back on its base, it would read as recharging, and sit there blinking for about four hours.<br />It's a pain in the butt to return, so I will not. I just will never recommend this product, or ever but anything by this company.<br />In comparison, we put regular batteries in that same wireless mouse, and it connected and worked immediately.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is an excellent show - full of suspense, horror and raw human emotion. While not for the faint of heart, The Walking Dead is well written and directed, with relatable characters. The third season appears to be the best so far.
1475143389|5.0|This book has all the great details for you if you are a beginner and even if you are advanced it will throw some info at you that you may have never known before. It definitely is a good motivational book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to embark on a strong fitness path.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed the trilogy. I couldn't put it down at night. Best book I've read in a long time
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It seems to work the way it is supposed to. Has a nice clear gui and helpful info. No complaints.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|This is a great no-brainer book to take on vacation. The story is entertaining and satisfying. The descriptions of computer equipment are too long, but easy to skim or skip.
B002BVOYBW|5.0|This movie is a fun, heartfelt movie. This is how siblings should love each other, unconditionally. One of Johnny Depp's best roles ever.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|This book was quick and easy to read. One of my first books read through Kindle. it's got some greatly inspiring and informative content, and refreshing illustrations.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Definitively concludes Bruce Wayne's story with some hope in what had often been a bleak story throughout the 3 films. Brought many themes and threads to an interesting conclusion going back to Batman Begins. Most plot holes reviewers point out do have an explanation WITHIN the narrative, Nolan just doesn't waste time showing you every train ride, bank transaction, etc. Avengers, although a good popcorn flick, could have benefited from letting the audience assume Tony Stark could fix the helicarrier's engine instead of showing it to us in real time. Where that film had maybe 3 issues of a comic covered in it at most, Dark Knight Rises crammed at least 3 of for major storylines/trade paperbacks worth of material into one film. The pacing isn't perfect, but is much more ambitious and willing to take risks.
B009AJDDQU|1.0|The featured 1-star awarded by Mr. Bullock (\\"Take the Scientist's Pop Quiz) is so complete I wont duplicate his efforts. However, while believing that the plot-logic appears written by an excited 14-year old, let's not dismiss the additional lengths one has to go to in order to neutralize both Charlize Theron and Rapace, the latter appearing more like a round-faced girl scout than the girl from Dragon Tatoo, and Theron, whose character looks SO impressive, is forced to deliver such a mindless script that you just shake your head at the waste of Charlize. This movie puts the nail in the coffin of my \\"Oh, it's a Ridley Scott movie,\\" a POV I had assumed since Gladiator.<br /><br />Idris Elba (captain/pilot) also is asking us to believe you pilot a zillion-dollar spaceship, tricked out with CGi'd advanced technology, but apparently give commands to the rest of the crew like the pilot of a bass fishing boat. For me, it felt jarring: you're asked to believe they have all these hi-tech gizmos but the writers don't even research any aeronautical / military command nomenclature and/or procedure for landing an aircraft, resulting in something so casual it's a combo of Billy-Bob meets Hans Solo. Look how Branaugh used Elba in Thor and as something worth comparing, because the waste of such talent and cgi budget is handled so sloppily it's difficult to believe that this is the same man that made Gladiator.
B00511PTWM|2.0|The product does work, but bought thinking I would keep plugged in all the time and instead only use it when absolutely necessary to have two devices plugged in at the same time.  It falls out of the socket in the car very easily and often, and similarly the phone chord and GPS chord that I plug into this fall out easily too.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I play this from my Galaxy II. The new version of this game is displayed horizontally on my phone. This prevents me from being able to click the download buttons necesarry to continue playing the game after unlocking the dressing room.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a family traditon for us.  We watch it as a family every year during the holiday season.  Now each of us will have a BLURAY copy.
0385535147|2.0|with the weather in the northeast being so bad, i was anxious to read this book. have been a grisham fan for a long time but have thought that they have been slipping lately.  his writing style is still excellent but the story while clever was very far fetched and i didnt like that he doesnt tie all the strings together. thats really all i can say without giving anything away.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is so much fun.. I'm always playing it.. a good time killer. I think my boyfriend gets mad sometimes because I play it to much. lol
B00913DPW2|3.0|Nice graphics, creepy music and that's about it. The &quot;clues&quot; are arbitrary and random with no real connection to either the story or each other. No real interraction with the ghosts or wolves. Plus it was constantly crashing. All atmosphere with not much going on. Still if you like mysteries it's not a total waste of time.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game! it is so much fun wish energy regenerated faster but all in all just like facebook app I am enjoying it a lot.
B000SJJCX4|4.0|Purchased this over a year and a half ago. Picks up every note just fine, except it struggles with the drop C on bass. The light is very bright. Other than that.. perfect pedal. Can't believe I've had 0 issues. I gig frequently too, so its getting moved around.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Awesome and Enlightening. It was great to hear a Doctor have a different view other than medical regarding NDE's. His detail is mesmerizing and visually clear of his experience.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Although I am younger than Rod, I think of hits like Maggie May, Hot Legs and Forever Young...to name a few, when I think of legendary Rod Stewart. When artists release a Christmas collection, it's usually a swan song of their career. Rod did a set of 4 Standards CD's with Clive Davis which kept him at the top and wooed all the romantic female Stewart fans. Rod also did pop and soul songbooks. In these recent recordings, Rod did 'holiday' versions of My Favorite Things, Baby It's Cold Outside (with Dolly Parton) and I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm. Non of which are included here but would fit well.<br />This is a 13 track mix of traditional Christmas songs. There is, of course, 1 original called Red-Suited Super Man which is great! When You Wish Upon A Star seems to be a holiday song as well these days fitting on other artists Christmas CD's. Also included are duets with Michael Buble' on Winter Wonderland, We Three Kings with Mary J Blige and the tilte track Merry Christmas Baby with Cee Lo Green. New Years is not forgotton with tracks like Auld Lang Syne as the last song and What Are You Doing New Years Eve featured as a duet with the late great Ella Fitzgerald...kind of odd pairing.<br /><br />The CD lives up to the 'new' Rod Stewart expectations and if you mellowed out with Rod, you will love it! If you like Christmas, you will find the Target exclusive bonus track CD that includes 3 more bonus tracks: What Child Is This, The Christmas Song and Silver Bells. It would be nice to have a cd with all 19 tracks together. Maybe there are more tracks to come? Rod Stewart Christmas 2-4?
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Duhigg uses many interesting examples to explain the overwhelming power of habits. This book opened my eyes to the multitude of habits that control our day to day activities and the power we have to change them. This is a great read that is hard to put down.
B00932AA5G|5.0|I wish there were more movies out there like it. Very original and entertaining to the very end. Great movie.
B0086700CM|4.0|The best game so far. Addictive.<br />Gave a four star because you can never win this game.<br />Amazing nevertheless. :)
B007V65R54|5.0|This would be a great book anytime but it is a must read following the election.  Why were so many pundits surprised by Obama's victory?  It's not rocket science if you know how to separate the signal from the noise.  Unfortunately the pundits are frequently the source of the noise.  It will be hard to watch the Sunday morning news programs after reading this book.  No wonder the pundits hate Nate Silver.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|This book was very different. Both interesting and a little disturbing. I also liked the German words because I am studying German.
0446580848|3.0|The Panther was a good read, but with less depth than one normally experiences with DeMille. John Corey's flippancy was at times irritating and with less acuity than previously.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a big fan of grisham, and I must say that this is one of the most fun reads out of any book I have read. Period.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great product. easy to use. easy to see. overall nice product. hope others like the calculator the way I do.
B0042GIRYE|5.0|I am a ZB junkie and love all of their music-they put on a fantastic show and sound even better live. love the amazon cloud player.  Makes listening easy from almost anywhere.
B007704HO6|5.0|I loved this story. Inspirational. I wish James and Bob a long and prosperous lifetime together. A must read for cat lovers and realists everywhere!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I was anxiously awaiting this latest Kay Scarpetta saga, but I must say, it was somewhat of a disappointment.  I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta books more than once, and this one, to me, is a one-time read.  I do look forward to Patricia Cornwell's next book though.
B000L9IUPM|5.0|It's the \\"Eagles\\", what's not to love. A compete concert and backstage stuff. The boys are in great form. Amazing stuff!!!
B002VRZEYM|4.0|A tad slow at parts.<br />Overall?<br />EYE-OPENER.<br /><br />Will I still eat meat?<br />...yes.<br />I'll buy organic<br />...when it's on sale.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I bought this some time back and am really enjoying it. Has so many good hits and some that don't play regularly that are as good hits. If u like Maroon 5, get this one.
0061122416|3.0|We read it aloud together. It was interesting and we enjoyed the ending (though we saw it coming). Showed a mish mash of religious thought, but gave me a chance to explain some things to my son about how people misuse Christian thought and the Bible.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I love this series so much I have ordered all the seasons.<br />I want Charlie back!  I plan on watching them all over again next year.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have read all of the John COrey novels.  I have enjoyed all of them except The Lion.  I thought that was an incredibley shallow piece of work.  Things are somewhat back on track with the Panther, but it is still a bit lacking in intrugue as well as action.  There is a ton of build up to actually get to the action, but much of it is interesting in the development of the characters.  I thought the villain was incredibly weak, and mostly absent from the book. I liked the addition of the new characters on the Corey team.  One thing I think is a bit of a weak link in the story SPOILER ALERT below<br /><br />is that they basically give Tom a pass on sending John and Kate on a mission that was pretty clear was a CIA revenge mission against the two of them.  Maybe they deal with him in the next book, but I have a pretty hard time believing that John and Kate simply went back to their jobs in NY working for Tom when they had to know he was sending them on a set up mission. I am not sure much case can be made that Tom did not know, or at least have a very good suspician that the CIA was looking to terminate them.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a rather sad  premise (teenage suicide) but Jodi Picoult put an interesting spin on it and managed to keep my interest to the last page.
B008KE3960|4.0|I like it its an k but I just was looking for survival mode I'm on eight yrs old it is a really fun I loooooove it
B0052RDHTM|3.0|This was a good book and I enjoy books that stick to a family history.  I, also, enjoy historical fiction.  However, I felt like this just dwelled to much on some history and I became bored in some of it. If you are a real history buff, then you would probably like it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The only problem I have with this is that it reads too much like a soap opera script instead of a real story.
B0095R76EW|1.0|I was hoping to have a nice afternoon on the couch with no husband or kids and watch this movie. Holy crap it was absolutely freaking awful. Do not waste your time or money on this.
B005721W9O|5.0|There is literally nothing to improve in this film. Script, casting and direction are spot on. Comedy is subjective and you may or may not find this funny, but it's a study in how to create a film that hits on all levels of the film making art.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|First off, I must admit to being a long-time fan of the Marvel franchise,and especially the work of Stan Lee and his team.  Working at a major Super-store chain gave me ample opportunity to snatch glimpses of the Avengers movie as it was playing in our electronics department, and the pure SCOPE of the film on a large-screen TV made it imperative that I stop to watch at least a few seconds whenever I passed that section.<br /><br />TRUST me when I say this---this movie is MADE for the big-screen, but plays (and captivates the audience) just as well on the first-gen Kindle Fire!  I downloaded it to my Fire AFTER I bought the DVD, so I could play it on the go.  The picture clarity, color crispness and overall awesome action purely blew me away.  The ONLY problem I've encountered is that it seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to download.  I don't know if that was because of the length of the movie itself, or a slow wi-fi connection.<br /><br />All in all, LOVED the movie, but one piece of advice for you to take or leave---watch the other hero movies first: Iron Man 1 & 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America.  That way, when you watch The Advengers, you'll be able to snidely turn to whoever is watching it with you throughout the movie and say \\"I know where they came up with THAT\\" or \\"THAT'S where she came from\\"!!  One-uppmanship is the BOMB!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Great story,the way it ended makes me believe there will be a sequel.would recommend this movie.the storyline line was suspensful.i enjoy these types of movies.
B008OOYALE|2.0|I downloaded this game to get more gems in Restaurant and Bakery Story. It's not really my cup of tea. The graphics are beautiful, but it takes too long to level up, everything costs too much money and it takes forever for stuff to build. It's in a similar vein to the other Team Lava games, this one is just not for me.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|I was just in the right mood for this really funny book. Not your usual Grisham, but still in the world of lawyers and litigation. Well-written, of course, and such lovable characters.<br />there is the real shady operation of Finley and Figg...that  have you in stitches. Enters a young disillusioned corporate lawyer, David Zinc, that literally one day can't stay a day longer in the very prestigious law firm he works for - and just runs off. How he joins Finley and Figg is not planned and spending a whole day in a bar has something to do with...Very entertaining. Hope there is a follow-up!
B009NPKTN6|5.0|For all of us who were young in the 80's, these songs will take you back and have you singing along!
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I think this may be the last Patricia Cornwell book I ever buy.  I read all the other reviews, they seemed glowing, I bought the book.  In my opinion, this is NOT the Kay Scarpetta that I used to enjoy so much.  There is so much psychological twaddle going on in everyones minds that the story line is almost non-existent.  I feel like Ms. Cornwell hates her readers, and so she writes books like this just to see if we're stupid enough to buy them (I was, won't be again).  I feel like she is talking down to me, sitting at her house, sipping a fine red wine, feeling smug at having put another poorly written book on the market, and people are buying it.<br /><br />The best character in this book is the cat that Scarpetta rescued.  It was more fully developed than any other character, and I didn't have to listen to its thoughts about what someone else was really meaning when they said, \\"huh?\\"  (Oh, dear, does he know that I actually looked at his chest while he was breathing?  Will he think that I desire him now.  Oh, there was a frisson of desire that ran down my back when our arms brushed.  Bentley will know by looking at my arm how I felt.\\")  An entire book like that is deadly BORING.<br /><br />Wish I could un-download the book from my Kindle. Wish I hadn't wasted my money on this book.  I'm sure there are other, better written, more interesting books out there.  Yep, gonna cross Patricia Cornwell off my \\"must read\\" list.
B0087K3VTW|5.0|Loved the book. Believable and engaging characters - well, mostly, and a story that combines spooky old buildings, secret underground chambers and a modern high tech campus. Some readers have been disappointed in the ending, but I thought it was perfect given the nature of the holy grail being sought. Only quibble is the afterword that details what happens to some of the key players after the main story ends. Didn't like it in Harry Potter; don't much like it here. Just an easy way for an author to tie up a lot of smallish loose ends without having to work too hard. All in all, a light page-turner well worth the time.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Even though the book spans centuries, I was caught by each story, each character.  My favorite was the 1970's story for some reason.  I think it was the quick nature of the chapters and the impact of what could go wrong if something blew up.  I recommend reading the book before watching the movie, not because the book is better... just so you can let the book uncompress as you watch the movie.  There is so much discussed in the book that only a mini-series could cover it all.  If you have the book in mind, the characters will pop to life instantly for you.  At least they did for me.
B008L1VZS6|5.0|I have to admit that the cover photo of a woman  in a state of hot pink undress nearly put me off buying this DVD.  I took one glance and dismissed it as more Eurotrash.  However, I was sufficiently curious to check every now and then to see when a review had been posted.  I was pleased to read that Mr. Gleeson, in his review, described the production as \\"refreshingly traditional.\\"  I agree with that as with all other points of his review.  It is such a treat to see an opera staged in a manner that composer and librettist would recognize as, and admit to being, their own creation, and not the production of some pompous idiot who shows contempt for composer, librettist and audience alike.  In this case, the production does exactly what it should do:  it tells a story, and in a way that's interesting, engaging, and (dare I say it) charming.<br /><br />The cast are uniformly excellent.  The only name I recognized was that of Anna Caterina Antonacci whom I associate with serious roles.  (I've seen her on stage as Adalgisa, Rossini's Ermione and Cherubini's Medea.)  She shows herself to be equally adept at comedy as tragedy.  The hot pink underwear on the cover is wrapped around her form.  My admiration of this fine singing actress increases every time I see her, whether in the theatre or on DVD.  She colors her voice to meet the dramatic situation and her technique is flawless.<br /><br />The other singers, though not so well known, all offer enjoyable performances.  The young lovers (Ivan Magri and Alessandra Marianelli) act engagingly and sing prettily.  Andrea Porta and Paolo Bordogna are a lot of fun in the two more purely buffo parts of the Baron of Kelbar and Signor la Rocca.  Best of all, though, is Guido Loconsolo as Belfiore disguised as King Stanislaus.  His voice is full and rich.  His characterization shows an appreciation of the predicament in which the king-for-a-day finds himself.<br /><br />The picture is crisp and the recorded sound splendid.  In everyway, this one's a winner.  It bodes well for the other, and forthcoming, releases in this series.  I shall sample further of those that don't feature Dimitra Theodossiu.  I think she should be behind bars for what she did to poor Lucrezia Borgia, but that's another review I wrote a couple of years back.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|MFAD is O.K. Sounds more 90's than  Rocks or Toys.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful\\" is catchy. \\"Lover Alot\\" is probably the best song.<br /><br />Am I wrong but does\\"Out go the Lights\\" and \\"Legendary Child\\" use the same riff? That's lame.
B004P7O4QK|5.0|Downloaded through the Amazon Cloud Player. This was a gift for my wife.  She listens to the songs every day!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The first half of the book is excellent. Then begins to fade a bit but overall, a very good read. I give the book a four star rating.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|\\"If you can die before you die, then you won't have to die when you die.\\" Eben Alexander's unique experience helps us understand that our fear of death is based on an illusion or a totally inadequate understanding of Life. The book helps cement the argument that our fundamentals of physics and science need a fundamental revisiting.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read all of Nelson's books and this is right up there with the best of them.  His writing style and store telling are so good it is a little depressing to get done.  Now I have to wait a while (too long) for his next.  This one was fabulous.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|this game keeps me occupied.  fairly challenging just not real exciting.  fine for FAOTD but if I had paid for it I'd probably feel cheated.
B0092C2X7U|1.0|this gamebis solo hard!o cant even pass the first level.you have to be so precise you cant even get passed the first level!!
B000002N3J|5.0|I firmly believe that if you can get past her lewd stage and theatrical acts, Madonna is an original and the work of a genius. Her work is very related to Kabbalah and also the principles of Metaphysics (the idea that we are all connected and that our physical world is only an illusion, the perfect right to and yet the complete futility of having to feel justified by the outside world, the value of expressing yourself in an authentic way, etc.). Especially in this album, I'll Remember (the theme song for the movie, With Honors) is a catchy, yet very important message about aligning with the Truth-with our common Truth: that on the inside, we are love and peace. Unfortunately, we often have to be reminded of this by a knowledgable and experienced mentor or guru, if you will (who will often be the person you least expect)-in the case of With Honors, that guru happens to be the homeless man-in order to have any hope of attaining this.<br />  Some may think of Madonna as a so-called \\"soft porn star\\". Again, while I don't disagree that some of her stage and theatrical acts can be rather vulgar, if you look very carefully, that's all it is. An act. Deep down, Madonna is only trying to press buttons to promote a deeper truth and using the sex acts as superficial artistic moves to keep our eyes on it (and yes, on her for being a representative of it). Madonna is overall a very strong, intelligent, bright woman and my hat's off to her.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|best game ever best gamE EVER MWA HA HA HA<br />want update now but still totally awesome update update update yaaaaaaaaaay
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I enjoyed what he had to say but it was a bit too technical and medical for me.  I do realize that he is a physician and this has a lot to do with his field.  I would have liked to hear more about his experiences while in a coma.....or whatever he called it.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|The book is so much better - Twilda is good but not good enough to hold this movie together - they tried to turn this story into an art film - when if they would have been true to the story it would have been great
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read! John Grisham at his finest. I'm going to re-read it for the finer details. Good plot, wonderful characters (Grisham writes from the viewpoint of a black man), a few twists, and a satisfying ending.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|This was a very slow moving book that managed to keep your attention with some humor from the main character.  The amount of paper used for this book could have been reduced in half and still told the story.  Have read all of DeMille's books and liked them all and will look for a future book by him with the hope that he will refrain from way to much talk and a little more action.
B003F3NEBG|1.0|Hi this review is on the pride and prejudice Blue-ray.  I love this movie and was excited to find out that there was an restored blue-ray version to buy.  I bought it and received it; and to my dismay when I opened and played it, the picture was all grainy - literally.  I immediately sent it back.  Amazon return policy is awesome.  I asked for a replacement Blue-ray. The replacement came a few days later. I opened it and to my dismay I found this blue-ray to be exactly the same as the one I returned.  I was in total shock.  This is there Blue-ray version, seriously!  I skimmed through the blue ray and to see if picture quality was really that bad all they way through. It was, and I found out that the sound quality sucked as well.  I was like wow this is just awful.  So I am sending this one back as well and getting a refund.  I am hoping this is just a bad batch of Blue-rays. I don't know.  I find it hard to believe that any company would put out something that bad on purpose.  I played this on two different Blue-rays players.  One is the Sony play station the other is a Toshiba.  I have played multiple blue-rays on these two systems and picture & sound quality is great on those Blue rays.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My 11 year old daughter was reluctant to read it because \\"everybody's reading it\\" and she doesn't want to be part of any clique or trendiness. One of the boys who is  her best friend convinced her she should read it and she read for 4 hours a day straight until she finished it. Now she raves about it. I borrowed it and also enjoyed reading it over the next few days. Would recommened for inquisitive people and great to provide fodder for dicussion of current social issues and their relationship to the events in the Hunger Games.
1451638450|5.0|Totally awesome.  I love this series and Ivan's book was such FUN.  I spent most of the book with an ear to ear grin.  Just one scene with Miles (which is good, or he would have taken over) but some lovely character moments with Lady Alys and Simon Illyan, plus the reappearance of Byerly Vorrutyer.  And, OMG the scene with Count Falco...  And the ending, and, and, it's killing me not to give spoilers.  Loved this book.  If husband wasn't reading it, I'd probably be rereading my fave scenes right now.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The plot was excellent and I admired Malcom Bannister's twist and turns to obtain his final goal. I just love John Grisham's writing.<br />Tita Garcia
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham ALWAYS brings it to the table.  Perfect, fresh - keeps you entertained, interested and hating to put it down.<br /><br />Grisham's works are NOT dark, even in dark situations.  My husband was an attorney and sometimes<br />I laugh out loud at Grisham's realistic dialogue  He is clever -- and has become my favorite contemporary author.<br /><br />I will weep the day John Grisham ceaases to write.  In that I could be his mother, well, you know the odds - so Mr. Grisham, hang in there for just a few more years for me.
1449410243|5.0|Gave this book to my fiancee, and she loved it.  I think anyone that's ever had a cat can relate with the toons in this book.  It's really well written, and the comics are excellent.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|cool game needs a couple of things like when you charge the battery it should be sarounded by lighting or something like that.I ment what I just said.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love it and have a hard time putting it down - haven't finished it yet but I am looking forward to it.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this complex and beautifully written book. It makes you think about life, love, loss and fear and is a book that will stay with me for a long time.
B00881VLCE|4.0|the app. is awesome but there are some issues with it freezing. I was in the middle of the puzzle and itbforce closed on me and lost my progress in the puzzle.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I always love J Grisham stories and this was another great book  I would recommend this to all individuals who like crime & corruption
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game..once you start playing you won't be able to stop.<br />I just wish it gave more coins they run out fast.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Ms. Cornwell has sorted through the mess and gotten back to form.  This is an awesome book, remindful of her earlier Scarpetta stories.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|The book is about 1/3 to 1/2 about his life and the rest is about the craft of writing and his advice on how he thinks it's best done.  Very interesting as both an insight into a great writer's life, his influences growing up as a child and how those influences shaped him into the writer he is.  He also discussed how certain ideas turned into some of his most famous book, which is very interesting if you're a fan of his work.  Overall a good read for any Stephen King fan or writer.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It was well thought out.  It is very easy to play with all the features they have.  It's the most fun version of solitaire out there and it's a pleasure to play.
031620157X|5.0|Oh my gosh it is soooo amazing... i think that every little kid should read this as they grow up. I know there's a second one coming out with a 'the' in the title and I'm so excited to buy that as well! :D
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Overall I really enjoyed this movie but it had some major drawbacks that kept it from five stars. The biggest is the ammount of unexplained material in the film. I know that not everything needs to be explained, but it seems like the writers were just trying to show they were smarter than the viewers, and on the process just had random events happening that the audiance has no way of deciphering from the actual film.
B008KE3960|3.0|Well this is not what I expect. Was looking for something with better movement and control. Also the audio needs a upgrade. But I was glad it was free.
B004I744AS|5.0|The best dictionary for a Kindle Fire, hands down. So user friendly, my 7 year old can do it by himself.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was a real page turner.  Took some turns I wasn't expecting.  The ending made me say, \\"Are you kidding me?\\"
1451648537|5.0|Wonderful book, the guy was a genius very smart, very creative ok had a very small tolerance for mistakes but I could get him and admire him. The book is kind of technical so for people outside the IT area can be boring sometimes. I love it..
0307450570|5.0|Excellent and exceptional book. I had bought it as a gift for my wife and she was positively surprised by it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Haunting the way she portrays the dramatic end to a marriage. I love the poetic way she pieces together sentences. I had to put the book down because it got so intense, but I had to see what happens. Its like a bird's eye view into the whole Laci Peterson case, which I found fascinating. I definitely recommend this to anyone who reads James Patterson or watches Dexter.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Match 3 not my thing, got as a FATD. With that said its a good game in the match 3 genre. Nice graphics, well designed and thought out!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The game has beautiful graphics.  This match 3 is fun and challenging.  Thanks Amazon for putting this on as a free app, or I would never have tried a playrix game.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This. is Very intertwining.<br /><br />Their are constant challenges. The mixtures breeding of the dragon's is wonderful.  Waiting to see what exciting. new dragon will hatch.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is so much fun. you can always have fun with it. I like to breed the dragons and see what I cacti come up with. love the game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer grabbed me from the beginning and did not let go. What a great read. I totally bought into \\"Max\\" and found myself rooting for him every step of the way. Thanks John. Can't wait for your next book.
B0070066DI|5.0|I put this in my media center after discovering my V6 heatsink was way too large.  This thing is very low height, they could have added another inch of heatsink and it would still be lower than the height of a video card.  My V6 coolermaster would get around 70c on my i5 2500k @ 4.5ghz, this does around 76C.  So that is pretty amazing for how small this guy is.<br /><br />installing it was s bit tricky, just read the instructions a few times first and it goes alright.  Basically you attach the two brackets to the heatsink and put into the 4 \\"nuts\\" on top of the 4 screws that go into the heatsink.  Next you use the long buttom screws to screw in from the bottom support plate that go into the 4 screws you added to the heatsink.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|it was beautifully  written  and  had me questioning everything. it was a colorful book and  i truly enjoyed it. it made  you question  what  if ?
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Heard one of Fun's songs, 'Carry On' watching a taped Saturday Night Live in the aftermath and ongoing horror of Hurricane Sandy.  It just picked me up...a powerful and upbeat track.<br /><br />Now have the CD...and yes some of the lyrics might offend some of the people but the creativity and musicianship of this group and the variety of vocals throughout this album keeps me playing it!
B0092C2X7U|5.0|I DONT BELIEVE IT THIS IS THE FIRST GAME THAT EVER MADE ME LAUGH ALOT I LOVE WATCHING MY FAILS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  XD
B008OOYALE|5.0|From the simple fact that the fruit doesn't rot to the quests that always make breeding fun then there is the amazing breeding setup itself this game delivers.
B00846REIS|5.0|Ive never read such a sexully charged book! If you aren't getting it at home you can get it and more in this book! I couldn't put it down. Fifty shades of grey has nothing on this book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Typical Grishom - complete with twist. Thoroughly enjoyed this book, hooked in the beginning and held right up to the end.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I love her movies from tomb raider to this one, it was action packed and full of twist and turns, this one was no exception.  I always order from amazon because of the great prices and I have never had a problem from the sellers that was not fixed in a timely manner.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|Amazing book, really is a must read, so thought provoking, soul searching and emotional...I cried like a baby and was emotionally spent but glad I plucked up the courage to read it finally.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Some great effects and sets but overall I felt the story line wasn't very strong!  Very similar in plot to the original Alien and not nearly as well acted or frightening!  It does give some answers to true Alien fans.  I would give it 2 1/2 stars.
B003V5CTH8|4.0|The Elf Ultimate Collector's Edition is a great gift for anyone who loves the movie. Included in the set are a dvd of the movie with special features, a very skinny stocking (yellow & black like Buddy's tights and shoes), a mini soundtrack featuring 5 songs from the movie, Elf themed gift tags, and a magnet/magnetic picture frame. It all comes in the collector's tin pictured above. Elf is my favorite movie of all time, so I was very happy with this product. I would've enjoyed a few more perks--maybe a mini-poster or some stills from the movie. Overall, a fun product!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|story is intriguiging right from the start. And is fast paced, and action packed.<br />It is one of the best series I have ever read. Giving details into the type of equipment they use, and the back grounds they came from. Great reading.
1451638450|5.0|I definitely recommend this book.  I think it would work well as an intro to the rest of the \\"Vorkosiverse\\", but knowing the other characters really enhances the pleasure. And, many of the other friends and relatives make appearances here:  Miles, Ekaterin, Gregor, and Duv & Delia.  I especially enjoyed seeing the view of Lady Alys and Simon at home, and at ease.  BUT, this book is about Ivan, and exhibits him at times as: heroic, competent and loving.  Ivan also learns that his own relatives may not be half as bad as Lady Tej's relatives at getting him into trouble!
B001TOD92C|5.0|The movie came in its original package and was perfect. No trouble at all. Very happy with what I got. I would recommend this shipper for further movies. Thank you
B00992CF6W|5.0|This one of my favorite apps on the fire. This is very addicting and a fun game to play on a long wait. There is no lag or crashing on my kindle. thanks for making such a great game.
0385335482|5.0|It's been a while since I've read a book that made me literally laugh out loud.  This book did that in spades.  Come to think of it I think the last book that made me laugh so much was [[ASIN:0440241901 Can You Keep a Secret?]] also by Sophie Kinsella.  The character of Rebecca, our shopaholic, was deceitful, kind of selfish and a bit self centered.  How can you find yourself rooting for this character?  I don't have the answer to that but I can say with absolute certainty that you will.  I think that fact is a huge compliment to the author.  Rebecca goes through a ton of various \\"downs\\" before she's able to finally learn her ultimate lesson and the ride we go on with her is hilarious and all around fantastic!  I can't wait to pick up the next in the series.
B009JCL58G|5.0|This is one of the finest and most incredibly complex and musically sophisticated scores in recent memory.  End Title is absolutely incredible, and the rest is so amazing.  This is one of the best scores period!  Tom has done a fine job!!!!!
B004EPZ08O|5.0|I loved this film I have watched it 5 times so far I can never get bored of watching it. Its a great film
B000FCKIFU|5.0|This is one of my favorite suspense novels. Oliver Stone and his three comrades-sleuths' adventures are a terrific read. I was lost a few times in this book because I read it when I had the time for it and had to reread some parts. Anyway, it was fun. I recommend it highly to all avid readers... I'm reading Hell's Corner now and hoping it is as good as this book...<br />Steven Nedelton<br />Author of The Raven Affair
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Another fantastic read by a truly great author, not that I expected any less! My favourite author writing about my favourite character, and doing it just the way I like it.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Overall the game has a lot of promise. There were a few difficulty spikes that with a few lesson levels could have been evened out. Sadly as I got really good at building bridges there wasn't more to do. Like a really great movie ending after the second act and leaving you hanging.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always, John Grisham delivers!  Just another of his great writings....catches you right away...intriging, suspenseful and humorous.  Great book.  Also, the Theodore Boone, Kid Lawyer series were fun!!
B0090EHVMC|4.0|The movie was pretty good , but the streaming video was pretty bad, with several lost connections. This was the only reason, that I did not give it 5 stars.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This film was very good to watch I would watch it again it is a must buy for anyone it is a great film
0553381407|5.0|If you are locked inside family dynamics, and are confused by what you think is the right thing to do--or if you are struggling with guilt because what you feel or have to say upsets others in your life--this is a book you should read.<br /><br />When we are born our minds are clean slates.  We don't realize that our perceptions about the world, and the rules we are being taught to play by are actually forms of programming.<br /><br />If mommy uses guilt to get us to do what she wants--we learn to believe that is appropriate--right and good--and that mommy has all the power in the world to manipulate us into doing what she would prefer us to do.<br /><br />In my world--because I am an adult child of two adult children of alcoholics...I call this codependency.  But in reality--it is truly a toxic dynamic--regardless of what any mental health professional classifies it as.<br /><br />Anytime we forgo our own needs, wants, or opinions for the sake of keeping others calm, happy, or liking us--we are participating in a codependent and toxic dynamic.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this book--is how simply the information is presented.  Even if you never realized you were being manipulated...or bent to the will of others...after reading this book you may be surprised at how ambiguous toxicity can be.<br /><br />When we are little we do not have the cognitive ability to understand when mommy and daddy are making us responsible for their feelings...Then--when we get older, and bring spouses into our lives--the manipulation is sometimes much easier to see.  Toxic families lie, deceive and play mind games,  They shield themselves from the outside worlds, and know how to play the game so not to bring too much attention to them.  This sometimes makes it very difficult for children of toxic parents to 'see' that something is wrong within the family dynamic.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book for the empowering message it gives.  It helped me see things that I--even as a one who has considered herself in emotional recovery for sometime--missed.<br /><br />It is not easy to see our families truth and to come face to face with the fact that the parents we adore--are hurting us.  We want so much to love them and be loved by them...that we ignore the shameful ways they make us feel just for the sake of holding onto some kind of a relationship.<br /><br />When we finally face our parents dysfunctional belief systems...it is frightening and confusing.  We must learn to grieve who we thought our parents were, and what we will never have.<br /><br />It is not easy...but it is the only way to finally be free...<br /><br />Namaste...<br /><br />Lisa A.

0823015033|5.0|This book is designed for artists or beginners who are intersted in working with clay. I bought it out of curiosity, and I enjoy seeing the detailed techniques used to sculpt figures.
B003IY48PS|4.0|I remember when I was a kid of 10 years old and saw this movie for the first time.  Scared the bejeezus out of me.  Watching it as an adult, no more being scared silly, but still love the film.<br /><br />The camera work can be a bit roller coaster like, but that adds to the overall mood of the film.  The actors are typical B horror movie actors ( Bruce Campbell being perfect of course).  The special effects and visuals are top notch for the small amount of money that Raimi and company had to make this movie.  I definetely recommend this movie to any B horror movie lovers, or anyone who just likes gory movies.  Could of used some special features, or different commentary, however not necessarily necessary for a movie of this simplicity.
B00417HV14|4.0|Im not the biggest Bonamassa fan, some songs are great, others I can do without. But this is a great show, and if you have surround sound, CRANK IT UP! the ambient sound is fantastic. It sounds like youre in the theater.
B0051XSKSU|5.0|i bought this movie to watch with my nieces.. they loved it. my youngest loves Po because he's quote \\"fluffy\\".. the movie is funny and family-friendly.. :) very good movie choice!<br /><br />all of us really loved the part where Po and Master Shifu are training.
B001UV4XWY|5.0|Now this film was a good film it was a very strange film but it was good I would say its a must buy
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These books are a must read! I couldn't pit them down once I started. Suzanne Collins is a great author.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|On family night, I was prepared to fall asleep on the couch but I ended up watching it all.  Although... I was secretly hoping for Charlize Theron's character to prevail against the horrible actress who played the lead role.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I thought is was fab - i real snapshot of life in an English Town, it had me in tears..............for all the Weedon families out there...........
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A real page-turner!  Great plot twists and surprises!  Child does it again!  Would recommend to any and all mystery/thriller fan.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another typical Lee Child yarn. Very entertaining. Easy read to shorten any long flight or empty time. If you like action mysteries, buy it.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A puzzle about a puzzle.  I will reread the book looking for the clues that I'm sure I missed.  What fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|These books are a must read! I couldn't put them down once I started. Suzanne Collins is a great author. This is also a good ending to the trilogy! Cant wait to see the movies :)
B008ODZEQ0|2.0|Let me start by saying I was very excited to watch this documentary. I enjoy sushi, Japanese culture, Phillip Glass, and creative camera work. Surely a documentary that contained all of these would be amazing, right?<br /><br />I couldn't have been more wrong. I found the entire documentary to be very over-dramatized. The slow motion shots were way overdone, and Phillip Glass's music was just too much for this sort of film. The whole film had a very pretentious feel to it. The pace of the film also dragged, and largely consisted of a food critic talking about how great Jiro's sushi is.<br /><br />It's not that I really have an issue with the themes that were presented here. Seeing Jiro's passion for his work was interesting for a few minutes, but it just didn't captivate me for the entire movie. It's one thing to be passionate about your work, but it seemed that Jiro had crossed into the territory of obsession. Being a workaholic doesn't impress me as much as someone who lives a life full of balance and exploring new interests.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Saw this movie without any expectations and as soon as i started to watch,  i was immediately captivated! Price wise its the average you'd pay at any other retailer store. Still it WAS WELL WORTH IT!
0756655307|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo28INJF3EM725M]]This review is for the Marvel Encyclopedia (DK Publishing:Revised October 5, 2009).  I got this book for my nephew's birthday. He's not into comics like a hardcore nut, but he is interested in a lot of the characters.  Also, he likes to read.  He often asked me about the stories of characters, many of which I didn't know.  Finally, I decided, why not just give him an encyclopedia of the Marvel characters?  He was really thrilled when I gave it to him.  But as in the video, he did tell me not all of the Marvel characters are in there and how some of the characters he wishes had more info.  But overall, he really loved it, and almost a year later, I still see him flipping through it!  Personally, when I saw the book, it looked like it was pretty good quality.  The artwork in and on it I think is great, very vivid and colorful.  That's about it.  Hope this was helpful.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My whole family loved this movie! (The boys AND the girls!)<br /><br />We'll definetly pick this up as soon as it's out. Not waiting for x-mas!<br /><br />Reccomend parent's take the time to watch it without the kids as well. Great movie.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Young adult so it reads fast and the reader is nailed into the roller coaster with Travis and Abby so it's all good. Fun read of first love in college with kids who have pasts they're trying to live with and get beyond. Read it in two or three sittings because Travis, Abby and their friends are fully realized and want to spend time with them to see if they figure it out. Well worth your time. Received free copy for review.
