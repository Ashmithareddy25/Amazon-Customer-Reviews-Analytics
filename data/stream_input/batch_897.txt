B001PA0FFO|5.0|First, I must say that I have NEVER been a fan of Meryl Streep, but in THIS movie she is AWESOME.  As for the reviewer who found this film \\"glib,\\" I would strongly disagree!    This is not a movie about [...] and the priesthood, per se.  It is a character study of two strong personalities, a priest and a mother superior, and the battle of wills between them.  The title of the movie is VERY appropriate, for \\"doubt\\" is exactly what the film is about.    I believe that this is an IMPORTANT movie for many reasons.  Who are we as humans?  Who do we trust?  Who CAN we trust?  HOW do we trust when a sacred trust has been shattered?  SHOULD we trust anyone anymore?    BTW, I also highly recommend the movie \\"Our Fathers,\\" starring Ted Danson, although I don't think Danson was up to this role.  The supporting cast was superb.  Christopher Plummer gave a magnificent portrayal of Cardinal Bernard Law.  It is the factual story of the attorney who forced to light the Boston priest [...] scandals several years ago.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This newer edition of the has the water around the border fit together like puzzle pieces, which is very convinient for keeping all of the pieces together, but if one of those puzzle pieces gets damaged or bent, it can just make it more difficult.  Overall, this game is extremely fun and does not take forever like some board games...
B000001FLA|5.0|Although this album is named for the masterpiece instrumental that ends it, I think of it as the 3rd album of Yngwie's Trilogy of Master Albums that started with Rising Force, was followed by Marching Out and finally this one.<br /><br />There are several things that changed in his life after this, among them the pressure to reach a larger worldwide audience that resulted in a more commercial sound on the next 2 studio albums (Odyssey and Eclipse) and the knowledge that he was for a time one of the most admired and copied guitarists in the world, which was by then full of imitators, which did nothing to shrink his considerable ego. Yngwie was also hurt in a major car accident after making this but before Odyssey, although that sure as hell didn't slow him down for long, he came out playing faster than ever!  But on the first 3 albums, there is no question his licks and compositions were fresher and seemed to have limitless potential.  They became much more repetitive after he made Trilogy.<br /><br />I even love the over-the-top cover art, he must have thought of himself as nothing short of heroic (never been known for modesty) and undoubtedly came up with that idea himself!  Very bold lol.......<br /><br />If you have any Yngwie albums, you should absolutely have the first 3.
0061478784|5.0|I first saw the \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" movie and I wanted to read the source of such a great story.

0307388921|4.0|Victor Mancini is an anti-hero on a journey through his crisis of identity. If we do not know who we are, how do make meaning in our lives? The main characters in Choke pursue identity in different ways. For Palahniuk, people fill their empty lives with distractions \\"That's pretty much how we get through our own lives, watching television. Smoking crap. Self-medicating. Redirecting our own attention. Jacking off. Denial.\\" (p. 61). Vincent is consumed in sexual compulsions and later a delusion of being Christ. Ida Mancini, Vincent's mother, careens in and out of his life, battles psychosis by snorting trichloroethane and promoting chaos. She lives an admittedly empty existence of deconstruction and criticism.<br /><br />Palahniuk is looking for more than Post-modernism has to offer. He even makes a reference to Michael Foucault, a father of Postmodernism (p. 200). To this end, an interesting subplot involves Victor's friend, Denny, who collects rocks to build an evolving structure. Denny seems to represent the post-modern disconnection between thought and action. Vincent's mother spent her whole life deconstructing things but does not stand for anything. Mother chronically fights against conventions and laws. On the other hand,  Denny reforms himself by building an obscure edifice.  He recovers from a life of sloth and by taking action: when he constructs, he rebuilds himself. He's a new man mental, physically and spiritually. Maybe deconstruction isn't the panacea that post-modernists claim it to be. \\"If you change the way people think, she said. The way they see themselves. The way they see the world. If you do that, you can change the ay people live their lives. And that's the only lasting thing you can create.\\" (p 160)<br /><br />I do not agree when Palahniuk is compared to Vonnegut. Both tell a good joke. Vonnegut seems to use his joke as the sugar that coats an awful pill. However, Palahniuk is really just telling a boisterously dirty joke, but that's it. I think Vonnegut was adept at uncovering subtle but authentic truths about humanity. Palahniuk's social commentary does not ring true. He's undeniably funny, but his illusions to humanity do not ring true. For example, if you saved someone from choking, would you send them money? Palahniuk says yes. If an elderly lady suffering from dementia ruminates about the time she was raped, and a stranger approaches her and admits to doing it, would you stop ruminating about it? Palahniuk says yes: \\"You're giving people completion on the biggest issues of their lives\\" (p. 115).<br /><br />Palahniuk offers some effort at allegory, although he does not follow it thought. Some commentary about Jesus and, in delusion, the narrator believes he is Jesus. There was a theme about taking people's sin upon himself, but that was only a shallow reference. Consistent with \\"Fight Club,\\" Palahniuk loves to promote anarchy \\"Without access to true chaos, we'll never have true peace\\" (p. 159).  Overall, great read, although some life observations ring shallow. Palahniuk can definitely tell a dirty joke and imparts a lot of intimate details about sexual deviants.nk Vonnegut was adept at uncovering subtle but authentic truths about humanity.

B000002AP1|5.0|My first impression of this album was not a great one, but that's because at the time, i'd been up for 24 straight hours and wanted sleep. it all sounded very abrasive and angry and had completely killed the mellow i had  built up during the previous Jane's Addiction album. it was all very bad...<br /><br />Buuuuuuuuuuutttttt...<br /><br />i DID try this album again. this was the next morning after i'd gotten sleep. i suddenly started jumping about to the fast, over the top, punky guitars and mean vocals. i love the paranoid sounding title track, and strangely mellow 'Gimme Danger', and 'Search and Destroy' is just a great punk tune.<br /><br />This album stands perfectly tall next to the Pistols' Never Mind The Bollocks... as a great, fast-paced punk record.<br /><br />So, take my advice and buy this album. Put it on your car stereo and make a full speed b-line to hell!!!
055380684X|5.0|If Daniel Coyle's Book, The Talent Code, could be bottled, I'd give it to the nearly 1500 clients I've coached over the past 40 years.   Tom Peters couldn't be more accurate in his endorsement:  I am even willing to guarantee that you will not read a more important and useful book in 2009, or any other year.  And if all that's not enough, it's also a great read.    In this new world, talent development has become a major competitive issue not merely for individuals, but also for corporations and even nations.  With a sense of awe, media makes it possible for us to look in on the highly talented in numerous fields: sports, music, education and even business.    Conventional wisdom tells us that that this talent is innate and unchangeable.  As my generation puts it, \\"the cream always rises to the top.\\"  Daniel Coyle tells us that's dead wrong, and genes determine far less than most of us think.    One acquaintance said to me after I shared with him pieces of related research.  \\"I don't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Everything in my history tells me those ideas are wrong.\\"  I told him that I'd agree, except that the research is now overwhelming.    Sitting on my bookshelves are two very important books detailing the extensive research supporting every word of the Talent Code:  a 900 page handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance, by Anders Ericsson and others, and a much thinner book, Mindset, reflecting ground-breaking research by Stanford's Carol Dweck on motivation.  Uniquely, Coyle illustrates his conclusions in riveting narrative, surveying some nine different \\"talent hotbeds\\" around the world that have applied this new research in depth and are having success in spades, including the Curacao Experiment in Little League, the KIPP educational program, the Russian tennis program and the South Korean women's golf program.  Here you learn that technique is everything, and that \\"chunking\\" is the path to success.  Chunking consists of identifying the important elements of a behavior and grouping them into a behavior, making it possible to develop expertise in an activity, bit by bit.     A close reading will reveal that success is not merely that \\"practice makes perfect,\\" but is instead about coaching that emphasizes what to do, how to do it, and when to intensify that activity.  As a professional with more than 40 years of coaching, Coyle's discussion of the best coaching practices is exceptionally useful.  (I can't resist calling my readers' attention to his finding that more than half of the best coaches are in their sixties or seventies.)  The best coaching teachers, he believes,    focus on what the student is saying or doing, and are able, by being so focused and by their deep knowledge of the subject matter, to see and recognize the inarticulate stumbling, fumbling effort of the student who's reaching toward mastery, and then connect to them with a targeted message.      The discussion of myelin, the neuron wrapping that adds speed and accuracy to our movements and thoughts is depicted, rightly, as the Holy Grail:  the foundation of all forms of talent greatness.  You'll find an article on enrichment and glia cells, the makeup of myelin, on my website.  Since motivation and perseverance are major keys in the development of expertise, readers will find the discussion of \\"ignition\\" of much value.      In The Talent Code, we have the theory, the research, the application of that research in numerous fields, and example after example of success.  You read narrative after narrative in which the change is like an \\"adorable gecko lizard morphing into a slavering T. Rex.\\"  The effect  leaves observers dumbstruck, amazed and bewildered--all depicted by shocking change for the good.

B0002EXH5O|3.0|R.I.P. is one of the greatest 80's speed/thrash albums of all time, and I would easily give it a 5-star rating.  However, this \\"remastered\\" version is neither a faithful reproduction of that album, nor an improvement all things considered.        I finally decided to replace my long-played, very worn-out tape cassette version with the so called \\"remastered \\"CD version.  Got the CD in the mail, popped it into my car's CD player, and started listening.  At first things sounded great.  It seemed like there was so much more discernable base that brought out a hidden dimension of the music.      But then... oh then... By the time I hit Take No Prisoners it was clear that something insanely wrong was going on with the vocals.  I don't know.  Either Mustaine decided to re-sing the parts or they dubbed in a crappier studio version or whatever.  All I do know is that these new vocalizations ABSOLUTELY RUIN the songs and negate any value of any so-called \\"remastering.\\"      WTF?!?  Did the record execs think it would be a great idea to drag an aging, hung-over, Mustaine to a karaoke bar some random night so that he could take a futile run at belting out the old hits?            DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!  FIND, PLAY, AND LOVE THE ORIGINAL, THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO SOUND!
B001NESPHC|5.0|While driving on a cross-country trip this week, I, very fortunately, heard Bob Edwards, of XM Radio's Public Radio station interview Melody Gardot about \\"My One and Only Thrill,\\" her second, or third, depending on how and what you count, album.<br /><br />This is a remarkable album. Her voice is so lyrical and words so poetic, that, I feel, her songs would be just as powerful without any accompanying music. In discussing the songs with Mr. Edwards, she talked of how she, recovering from having a car run over her while she was on a bicycle, got tired of \\"taking all the medicine\\" the pain management doctor had prescribed for her.  Asking her what brought her pleasure, and hearing her say playing music, he prescribed music therapy.<br /><br />Later, in the interview, she tells how she came about playing the music she does.  She wanted to play from memory a piece for her piano teacher a piece from memory for his birthday.  In doing so, she played it at a different tempo and adds some notes, sort of filler notes.  He tells her, \\"No, you're playing it wrong.\\" Upon asking her about those extra notes, she says that she likes them and thinks they add to the music.  He realizes she is playing blues notes, and redirects her lessons to blues music.<br /><br />Two other stories that she recounts are the ones about \\"If the Stars Were Mine\\" and \\"Your Heart is as Black as Night.\\"  While writing \\"If the Stars Were Mine,\\" she talks about how there were these children playing outside while she was writing this tune, and she found herself wanting to go out there and tell them to be quiet; they were disturbing her.  Then, she realized just how lyrical their voices were, and she recorded the voices, adding them to the end of the song.  As for \\"Your Heart is as Black as Night,\\" she only says when asked whether this song is about a failed romance, the other person lacked color in their heart.<br /><br />These songs and her singing is beyond remarkable.  I wouldn't rate all of them 5-stars, there are a couple of 4's, but some, such as \\"If the Stars Were Mine,\\" \\"Who Will Comfort Me,\\" \\"Les etoiles,\\" and \\"My One and Only Thrill,\\" rate 6 out of 5, so for me it is one wonderful 5-Star effort.  As for \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" which she purposefully placed at the end of the album, before two \\"bonus\\" songs, and the Peggy Lee-ish \\"Your Heart is as Black as Night\\" these are worth the price of the album by themselves., but some, such as \\"If the Stars Were Mine,\\" \\"Who Will Comfort Me,\\" \\"Les etoiles,\\" and \\"My One and Only Thrill,\\" rate 6 out of 5, so for me it is one wonderful 5-Star effort.

B00005QGAT|5.0|This is the cd that first got me interested in music, dancing and MJ in general.  \\"Rock With You\\" was the song and upon one listen to this song.  I knew that i was going to enjoy not only this cd but all of his work in the future.  \\"Burn This Disco Out\\", \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\", \\"It's The Falling In Love\\" and pretty much every other song on \\"Off The Wall\\".  Make this an excellent cd for not only MJ fans but music fans in general.  He always has and will continue to be the King of Pop.  Excellent purchase and addition to music collections of just about anyone.<br /><br />RIP...MJ you will be missed.

B00005QGAX|5.0|Almost everything about this cd is what makes people love MJ's music.  He's able to bring out things and feelings that others never could.  He's much more personal on this record as he wrote 9 of the 11 original tracks.  From \\"Bad\\" to \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" to \\"Speed Demon\\" and \\"Liberian Girl\\".  \\"Bad\\" is a varied yet through and potent mix of music that will have you dancing along one minute and then being reflective in the next.<br /><br />But it's all done very well and just goes to show that no matter how long ago this record was made.  It more than stands up to the test of time and out does many of its peerd.  \\"Bad\\" is anything but that...looking for another MJ record to add to your collection.  Well look no further than \\"Bad\\" as just about every song on it.  Is worthy of several listens and downloads to whatever device you listen to music with.  11 songs of great work and 3 additional songs - \\"Streetwalker\\" \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\" (Spanish) and \\"Fly Away\\".<br /><br />Gone but never forgotten.  You'll always be in our hearts, MJ.

B0028K3192|5.0|this is an amazing album, yes it is a little short but the quality makes it worth. Maxwell came back with the strong \\"Pretty Wings\\",a beautiful/heartbreaking ballad that deserves without a doubt grammy nominations next year.  but the cd is all good, there is no auto-tune,no songs about women as an object...it is the opposite, it is a gentleman album with songs about his life situations.  i am glad that are still a few r&b artists like him still making good songs, we need that. can't wait for the next cd.    favorites:    1 - Fistful of Tears  2 - Love You  3 - Stop the World  4 - Pretty Wings

I AM older, I AM sober, but I'm still idealistic. The sets seem overly long and slow and drawn out. I love the artists, but they do not hold the same joy for me as they once did - some haven't been heard from for years, so it is like long-lost friends showing up at the door: what DO you talk about? I probably won't watch this too many more times. I was once SO excited about the concert, the artists, the era...pity.

Not 2 MENTION, a scant nine songs with a running time of just over a half an HOUR?  And what's with that improperly placed apostrophe in the title.  You can't apostrophize a plural word and modify it with a singular subject!  That's not how it works!  It should have been called/written:  BLACKsummer'snight or Black Summer Night.  Either way, but not as it's written on the actual album.  It's incorrect and only serves in making the artist/record company appear illiterate/uneducated.  So much for a WHACKsummers'night, RIGHT?

B0026MOVO6|5.0|When it has came right down to it, there honestly haven't been very exciting albums lately. But honestly, there are a lot of classics we are right now listening to in R&B lately. In the wake of Michael Jackson's death, many people have begun to discover what talent Jackson had left behind for so many generations. While he unfortunately didn't make that comeback that he was attempting to, another legend is set to come back into the public eye, Whitney Houston. Not only to remind fans of how powerful her voice still is for her upcoming 25th Anniversary, but also because of her anticipated record, I Look To You. But there are those who sadly have written Whitney off as a joke because of the vices that she had went through, and a heartbreaking divorce with Bobby Brown, they should also be strongly re-introduced to her elequent voice too, and why we still have fell in love with Whitney's strong songs. But in the meantime, her classics from her last few albums with Arista have finally been re-released on CD, after being out of print for awhile, and it really is time to feel that love again.<br /><br />The 2009 re-release of Whitney Houston's 1998 album My love Is Your Love is definitely worth taking a strong listen too, all over again. Her last record with Clive Davis heading Arista & then Clive leaving a few years later to form J Records, and also right at the time before her personal problems came around in the media. The songs really sound great all over again and have been remastered nicely, with a strong and dominant mix of Hip Hop, Urban R&B, and contemporary Soul, it definitely has still been Whitney's best record yet. The album includes a lot of great songs including It's Not Right But Its okay, the strong Diane Warren penned I Learned From The Best, the seductive and intimate Say Yes, and the somber You'll Never Stand Alone, which I found very soulful, on a personal not which helped me cope with my cousin's death back in 1999. But unlike current R&B records like Ciara's Fantasy Ride, which the collaborations seem flimsy and weak as a mouse and lacked a lot of chemistry in the soul, the collaborations on My Love Is Your Love here are strong and really keep with the rhythm on a lot of great songs including When You Believe, Whitney's acclaimed duet with Mariah Carey that won an Oscar for the movie The Prince Of Egypt, Heartbreak Hotel with Faith Evans and Mariah's former backup singer Kelly Price that still remains soulful and down to Earth, and a great collaboration with Missy Elliot on In My Business, all the way to ending with a urban and driven cover of Stevie Wonder's I Was Made To Love Him.<br /><br />All in all, while there honestly isn't anything extra to add to the re-release of the record like her dance mixes of the songs, it still feels great to be reminded of why Whitney Houston is truly one of the best female songstress' and icons in music history. If you haven't yet owned a copy of My Love Is Your Love, than I absolutely recommend this record for your MP3 music library, and even as a CD as a whole too. I still think of this as one of the Top 20 records of the 90's. I am very anxious to see Whitney comeback into the light with her new record soon, and her upcoming performance on Good Morning America in September, but in the meantime, I'll be listening to the classics, and if you haven't heard My Love Is Your Love, than I strongly suggest you give it a great listen to.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: A 1/2-<br /><br />Price: A<br /><br />Remastering: A<br /><br />Overall: A-Fantasy Ride, which the collaborations seem flimsy and weak as a mouse and lacked a lot of chemistry in the soul, the collaborations on My Love Is Your Love here are strong and really keep with the rhythm on a lot of great songs including When You Believe, Whitney's acclaimed duet with Mariah Carey that won an Oscar for the movie The Prince Of Egypt, Heartbreak Hotel with Faith Evans and Mariah's former backup singer Kelly Price that still remains soulful and down to Earth, and a great collaboration with Missy Elliot on In My Business, all the way to ending with a urban and driven cover of Stevie Wonder's I Was Made To Love Him.

B0006GAO5Y|3.0|Chuck this up to yet another movie everyone loves that I just don't get.  Okay, so I understand that the whole `underdog' routine is endearing, but I can't see anything truly remarkable or even special about this offering.  There are plenty of films out there that follow this same structure, yet they offer us something more.  You see, when a film is this `simple' it has to be on top of things when it comes to script and acting and really everything else that contributes to the movie watching experience.<br /><br />Sadly, `Rocky' doesn't really offer us that.  The acting is decent in some areas and outright atrocious in others (Oscar nominations for Shire and Young are REPULSIVE to say the least) and the script is average at best.  The shining light here is definitely the direction, because John G. Avildsen manages to keep a gritty, realistic tone with the film that aids in at least making us feel a part of things.  His handling of the boxing scenes are rather inspired I thought, and even though I've seen them done better (by Eastwood and Howard most recently) I have to say that what he did was, for the time, very commendable.<br /><br />I've rallied behind films like `Cinderella Man', which follows a very similar plot, and even boasted it as one of the best films of that year.  The reason being is that, while the plot was `simple' in that it was familiar and none-too-complicated, everything about the film, from the acting to the set pieces to the direction to the character development to the actual script was pristine and nearly flawless.  Even if the plot is simple, the script should allow for the characters and the situations to shine.<br /><br />There are parts of `Rocky' that appear rather lazy to me.<br /><br />So, the story is that of Rocky Balboa; an amateur fighter who gets the break of a lifetime when he's challenged by a big wig in the ring.  So he trains, and he trains, and he trains; hoping to capitalize on this opportunity.  In the process he dates a neighbor, gets into it with her brother, and manages to lift the spirits of those in the community.<br /><br />I'll hand it to Sylvester Stallone, for he actually turned in a decent performance, with moments of real authentic emotional connection.  The fact that he wrote the script aided him tremendously, because he was obviously connected to the project and so that connection bleeds off into his performance.  As far as acting is concerned, he may be the films ONLY shining light, and that is sad since he's not really that great of an actor to begin with.  Burgess Meredith has his moments, and I actually understand his Oscar nomination to a degree, and on some days even agree with it.  Talia Shire and Burt Young are horrendous here and deserve NOTHING, but for some reason pulled out Oscar nominations (and the fact that Shire was placed lead and still got a nom is ridiculous).  Young is the worst thing about this movie.  Talk about overacting, and it wasn't even a fun kind of `hammy'.  Shire is just very green.  She's always been green.  Everything she's in she manages to appear almost out of place.<br /><br />Toting this as `the best boxing movie of all time' and the fact that it won the Best Picture Oscar over the much more (and by much I mean MMMMMMUUUUUUUCCCCCCCHHHHHH more) deserving `Taxi Driver' are just two more things that tend to leave a sour taste in my mouth.  31's `The Champ', 80's `Raging Bull', `04's `Million Dollar Baby'; those are just three boxing films that are in a whole other league when compared to this average film.<br /><br />I just wish that this movie was better.<br /><br />I'll give it a C, thanks in large part to Avildsen's inspired direction.<br /><br />I know that I'm going to get a lot of hate for this.  I've realized that I just don't get a lot of the love and adoration for a lot of films lately.  My reviews for `The African Queen', `The Terminator', `Lawrence of Arabia' and `Do the Right Thing' have garnered me a lot of disgruntled and even hateful comments, and I'm sure this one will do the same.<br /><br />I say \\"bring it!\\"I say \\"bring it!\\"

B000FL7CAK|5.0|All of the Veronica Mars series is wonderful.  I was disappointed that the show canceled.  I'm in my 40's and thought it was a teeny bopper show that I never would have watch.  A much younger friend let me borrow her series.  I didn't do anything for 3 days!  I couldn't stop watching!  It's brilliantly written and acted.  I highly recommend it!
0393324818|4.0|I must be one of the last people to read Moneyball.  When it first came out I was not mentally prepared to read a new approach in the game.  Not that I'm a tradionalist but it was baseball.  It's the long ball.  It's turning the double play and hitting the cutoff man.    Now that I've opened my mind to many new things in life my timing was good.  I actually felt like I was reading a couple of books in one. The life and times of Billy Beane and the Perfect Storm.      So many have the physical talent but the mind gets in the way.  That certainly was the case with  Billy Beane.  Years ago he would have been given his walking papers if he walked in to the boss and said I don't want to play but I want a job in the office.  But timing was perfect for him.  Everything was coming together, new owners and Sandy Alderson.  So they tried new things and it pissed off the world but had some success.    Now other teams are trying these methods and that shouldn't surprise anyone.  Afterall were in a world of data, today's generation doesn't fight it they massage it and tinker with it and find little bits and pieces that just might give them an advantage.  What's wrong with that.  Baseball for so long was untouchable, it cloned it's managers, coaches, general managers and everybody was happy.  Now a new creature appears and there is skepticism and words written in massive quantities about the perilous end to the game.      I don't buy in to everything they say is working, but that can be said about any business that starts to look at things in a new way.  Give it time and it will reveal itself.  In the meantime it was fun to read and once again as you deal with human nature there is no answer only more questions.

0312427999|5.0|I caught up with Klein's no logo last year (somewhat late considering it was out in about 2000 and seemed to be read everywhere I went at the time). No Logo was terrific, but stunningly I think Klein has outdone herself with this one, it's a masterpiece.    There is so much to say about this book, that it could take a month to compose and do it justice. I think that !Edwin C. Pauzer review 'shockingly powerful' pretty much says it all (it's a 5 star review).    This is what I have to add.  I think the brilliance of Klein's book boils down to this. It essentially creates an over-arching narrative and pattern over the last 35 years of politicking and foreign and domestic policy by the US (mainly) and other nations allied to the US in how an orthodoxy called neo-liberal economics that originated with the Austrian economist von Hayek and his US counterpart Friedman was imposed on country after country using the most underhand and society traumatising events. Coups, military takeovers, IMF/world bank shock therapy demands and finally wholescale foreign wars.  This economic model was forced on the countries usually with the help of insiders looking to benefit from the coming deregulation and wholescale wealth transfers and was designed to replace the developmental models of economics that took root in many third world nations in the 1950s and 1960s.    As you read all 466 pages of the paperback edition, you feel as if you have woven a coherent thread through many key events of the post WWII period of world history. The book is exceptionally timely as we are now witnessing the global meltdown of neo-liberal economics. For such a wrenching and complicated story, it's a surprisingly easy read and is in fact beautifully written.    This is a deeply important and informative book, I don't think you can truly understand how the world works, or what has been done to hundreds of millions of people worldwide in our name in the last 35 years, without taking the time to treat yourself to this superb effort by Naomi Klein.
0061367036|5.0|Written as if the Winchester brothers are talking with you about the lore and legends that make up their life's work, this book is great fun for fans of Supernatural the show, and supernatural lore in general.  There is plenty of detail straight out of John's journal and from the boys own research and experience.  You'll learn exorcisms, all about witches, tons of detail about demons and more.  The tone is fun and really gives you the feeling that you're hearing it straight from Sam and Dean; it is true to the characters.  Be aware, this is not an exhaustive reference book.  It is a fun, quick reference to many of the creatures in the Supernatural universe with a little Sam and Dean thrown in for your pleasure.
0688014291|4.0|This book is a very fast read and gives and overview to some nice concepts.  Managing people is a bit more complicated than the book explains, so I consider this book and intro to see if you enjoy reading management books.  If you like this book, then there are many more solid books out there to graduate to.
006112429X|5.0|An amazingly gripping novel. You think you know the ending but you don't.  It examines the mother-son relationship when it goes wrong and forces the reader to confront his/her own conceptions of love.  It's hard to get into but after about 60 pages I couldn't put it down. I gave it to my son (age 40) and he was equally impressed with its power.
B00192IV0O|3.0|3.5 Stars<br /><br />I purchased the two CD version of this and can't stand the 2nd CD, don't listen to that one. However, after you get used to all the vocal synth you find this CD good for energizing your workout. I think a lot of the songs are very good and wish they'd left out the synthesizing so I could just enjoy the pure vocals along with the music. They have synthesized this CD to death. It is hard to believe that any bandmembers could have finish this album, listened to it and think - 'oh this is great!' when it is *so* over done. More is not always better and this theory really shines through on this particular effort by the Black Eyed Peas. The best tracks on 'The E.N.D.' are the ones least electronically worked. Though I found that after listening to it a few times a lot of it grew on me, I don't know if it is because I looked past all the 'messing around' to hear the song itself or just because I do admire all of the energy it generated. I am hoping that the BEPs will hear their fans and show they care on their next effort by being less geared toward techno-pop and make more music with the sounds that attracted their adoring fans in the first place.

B00030590I|5.0|This was an incredibly beautifully made movie.  The action and fight scenes alone are amazing but the use of the colors during the telling of Nameless' exploits against Flying Snow and Broken Sword each has a use.  I can rewatch it numerous times without getting bored.<br /><br />For any Jet Li or Zhang Ziyi fan, this movie is a must own.  Even the soundtrack draws you in to the movie, letting you feel what the characters feel.

B0028K3192|5.0|Maxwell, has been gone from the scene for eight years, and in all the recent interviews that he has done he has explained the need for coming out with a short CD.  But, regardless of the fact that this CD is short in my opinion I feel that short is more, because from the first song Bad Habits to the end with Phoenix Rising, Maxwell delivers on each track!! This first installment is his entering back into the scene and he does with a vengance he leaves no stone unturned throughout this CD.      Even though this is wonderful return for Maxwell, it is really hard for me to pick a favorite because each song is simply beautiful, but some of my standouts are:    1. Bad Habits  2. Cold  3. Pretty Wings  4. Stop the World    With honorable mention going to:    1. Help Somebody  2. Love You  3. Fistful of Tears  4. Playing Possum  5. Phoenix Rising    All can is say what Max delivers is real R n B something that has been missing since his departure.      Kia (MFF)
B001N26GFM|1.0|I rented this movie because I was deciding on whether to buy the book for my son who is 9 and 1/2 but needs books at higher grade levels to challenge his vocabulary. After being shocked by the ending, in my opinion, there is no way any child younger than high school needs to learn about history through \\"wishful payback emotional manipulation\\" of this tawdry kind. I just about threw up at the end because I related to the mother's reaction in such a personal way - she was a fabulous actress even if the story line made her seem inconsistent - I naively had no idea where it was leading till late into the movie and kept watching because I couldn't believe it would end there.   But yep -that's exactly what happened. Even the friendship between the little boys (Aryan and Jew) I feel was sullied by this twisted ending which was not a voluntary act of love and friendship on either child's part. Don't support cheap tawdry emotionalism like this.

B0014I4KH6|5.0|Its hard to determine which cd is better, Fearless or this one. Taylor is a talented young woman and will go along way in the music industry if she keeps writing and performing like these 1st & 2nd collections! Many young listeners are associated with being fans but I think there are some older ones out there too! Some of her music brings out the juvenile in us too!
0452284392|3.0|The book \\"Linked\\" is very interesting and it is written so that the average person can follow it. However, the author describes every detail (it seems) of how he and his colleagues discovered the links, hubs, etc., and how they disproved past theories, etc. For some people, that's probably interesting, and even good for people who want to do real research and use this book as a reference. However, for someone who is just curious, there are too many mathmatical formulas and scientific references. I found myself thinking, \\"Get to the point already.\\" Not recommended for the average joe reading out of curiosity. Too much information that the common reader will not care about, but a lot of information for scientists, mathmeticians, researchers, etc. Overall, though, a good read.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Great story.  This is a very fast read but I think it was because I enjoyed it so much.  It gives you a great perspective from the dog's point of view. Another thing was that it you felt almost every emotion while you were reading it too!
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I loved that you can watch all the versions of this movie. OK, I am going to really upset some serious sci-fi fans but I loved the narrated/voice over version of the film better than the director's cut. I hated that I could never find it. Having the US theatrical release, the international release (not much difference there) and the director's cut was GREAT! Yes, having all the background stuff is great as well but to be able to compare what the Hollywood exec's thought would sell versus Scott's own version of the film is a bonus. Really great and I would strongly recommend the box set.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|wow, i've bough things that say like new before but this one takes the cake!  The DVD and package were in perfect condition.  Had i not known better i would have though it WAS new.  It arrived faster than i though it would. I am a very satisfied customer!!
B000HBKCDC|3.0|I could not wait to get this Christmas CD because I love Sarah's voice, but I was disappointed by this collection. First of all, I hate the song \\"River\\", it is the most depressing downer of a song I have ever heard, and certainly not a song that you want to listen to if your goal is to get in the spirit of the joy and warmth of the holidays. Secondly, Sarah- why, with your beautiful angelic voice, did you have to massacre the classic \\"What Child Is This\\"??? I was anticipating this to be one of her best songs on the album, because its haunting melody and lyrics should have suited her voice perfectly, however Sarah changed the notes of the song so its almost not even recognizable as the Christmas classic that it is. She totally ruined the song, which I didn't think was possible. I am SOOO sad about it! She should have just sung it the right way, and it would have been outstanding!!  The rest of the CD is fairly good. The Charlie Brown classic \\"Christmastime Is Here\\" is soft and beautiful, and personally I do like her version of \\"So This Is Christmas (War is Over)\\". So, I listen to about half the songs on the album, and skip over the other half. I wish she had just sung all the songs the right way with traditional music and lyrics, and she would have had a much better album.

B0028K31CE|5.0|I have been waiting for years for Maxwell to come back with more amazing music. He is an artist who is among the elite in music--both cool as hell and talented with a great product to back it up. Finally after all the long delays (8 years). He is back and sounds as good as ever but with something new. The sound of the album is new and amazing. Again the entire album is consistently good enough to listen to and enjoy--something unique these days. To anybody who loves R&B music at its best this is an album for you. Lovin it!!!!
0385341008|4.0|Strike one (fouled off) against this book: my Mom recommended it to me. As much as I love my Mom, her tastes generally lead her to read books too sentimental for my own.<br /><br />Strike two (looking) against this book: I was eminently confused for the first few dozen pages (or \\"locations,\\" since I read it on my Kindle). The book is actually a collection of fictional letters exchanged between a witty, unassuming writer, her London circle, and a group of lovable misfits who are forced by dire circumstances involving the Nazi occupation of their Channel island to invent a literary society. This society, which was created first as an alibi to escape the wrath of unforgiving Germans, proved to be the perfect coping mechanism for its members, allowing them a much-needed respite from the painful realities of an unwanted occupation.<br /><br />Thankfully, both for my Mother's credibility and my own pocketbook, there was no strike three for TGLAPPPS. While our co-authors don't get the ball out of the park, the book was definitely a hit in my view.<br /><br />For those worried that the popular text is a sensationalized, sappy narrative, don't despair. Again, while the book starts a little slow, as the characters develop through the letters, one grows attached to each's unique idiosyncracies. In fact, the book is emotionally heart-wrenching, not because of implausible plot twists, but because of its portrayal of humanity.<br /><br />I was not personally acquainted with the story of Guernsey during World War II. This book was thus an excellent education as well as an addicting fictional narrative. It is chock-full of endearing characters, such as the central Juliet, a London-based writer whose humor-infused correspondence with the other characters reveals a happy-go-lucky individual committed to the improvement of her brethren, through both written work and public examples of self-sacrifice. One of my favorite characters was the impossibly adorable Isola, whose penchant for witchcraft, potions, and phrenology make her excellent comic relief in the context of a sometimes  depressing story. And of course there is Elizabeth, who is at once both the picture of human imperfection and an example to all of what heroines are made of. Her relationship with a German occupying soldier, her care for a helpless slave laborer, and her ultimate sacrifice in a Nazi prison camp make her the ultimate heroine for Juliet.<br /><br />I will say that reading this book on the Kindle was somewhat frustrating. It is a book that demands doggy-earing and constant review. There are a lot of characters throughout the text, and being able to go back and forth would have allowed me to more fully appreciate the lovely folks who populate this book.gy make her excellent comic relief in the context of a sometimes  depressing story.

0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers reads as a provocative new interpretation of the foundations of success. As the reader pages through his numerous examples of seemingly heroic success stories who in fact owe their fortune and fame to circumstance, that reader is tempted to toss aside all previous assumptions about the roots of individual merit.<br /><br />In fact, however, all of his examples lead us back to two fundamental observations. First, it pays to be in the right place at the right time. And second, to achieve the highest levels of success one has to work harder than everyone else. These are truths that perhaps many find to be self-evident. Even still, Gladwell provides sound evidence of numerous revolutionary thinkers, entrepreneurs, and athletes who seem to strongly support his hypotheses. If the pursuit of knowledge is best undertaken through the concerted demonstration of seemingly obvious observations, then Gladwell has given us a wealth of new evidence for our extant assumptions about the cause of success. To boot, Gladwell's ability to weave his vignettes into a cohesive and easy-to-read plot line makes consuming his work thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />I spent the last two years of my life teaching fifth graders on the South Side of Chicago. One of my biggest struggles, and most important tasks, was to convince my students--all of them--that they could succeed if they worked hard and took advantage of all of their opportunities. I did my best to reward hard work above pure intellectual prowess, and frequently relayed to my students stories of my own lucky breaks in life. I found that it was the students who put the most effort into their work, rather than the ones with the biggest reserve of brainpower, who made the most growth and ended up at the head of the class. I only hope that they will benefit from some untold future advancement in technology. Perhaps they too will be as lucky as Bill Gates, hockey players born in January, and indeed Malcolm Gladwell himself, all of whom, apparently, are indebted not to their parents' gene pool, but sheer dumb luck.of whom, apparently, are indebted not to their parents' gene pool, but sheer dumb luck.

B000FBFMIO|5.0|Pete Hanlin {Hickory Creek, TX}   I was discouraged at the conclusion of the Farseer trilogy (being unaware of the Tawny Man books).  Once I discovered this continuation, I was delighted to find the same quality of writing continues on through this series.  Although not usually a fan of the fantasy genre, these books now rank in my top 20.  Farseer should be a pre-requisite read, but if you are a Farseer alumni, I can not fathom why you would hesitate to continue on this excellent literary journey!
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris' indictment of religious faith is right on the money. What is religious faith, anyway? It's intellectual dishonesty; it's lying to yourself or others; it's ignoring contrary evidence; it's shutting off or not trusting your own mind. At least the species of faith that Harris addresses in his excellent book. The species that informed the 9/11 terrorists, set the groundwork for the Holocaust, rears its ugly head to vilify homosexuals, etc., etc.<br /><br />I won't repeat the points made in other five star reviews other than to say that Harris makes a very strong case. I find it interesting that this book has been so heavily criticized by the faith community. This is extremely telling. As a former believer myself, I have a pretty good sense of what's going on here. People's anger towards this book has everything to do with their childhood indoctrination. The faith-based belief system (or meme if you will) is set up so that people learn to get upset (and frightened -- hell anyone?) when their religious beliefs are challenged. This is a crucial part of the \\"virus.\\" That's why this book and others, which tease out the virus are so important. When we finally admit to ourselves that religious faith is silly, harmful, and totally inconsistent with our abilities as humans, we can finally eradicate this outdated thought system just as we would eradicate any harmful virus.

B001PPLKI0|5.0|An excellent compilation of his gospel work with some recordings that got verl little \\"popular\\" play.
0385751893|4.0|I had seen this book around all spring but didn't want to get involved in yet another Holocaust book. But a discussion among some moms I knew prompted my desire to read the book especially since there was a movie out about the book. After having read \\"The Book Thief,\\" I was inspired to try another YA book on the Holocaust. Only this book I would not recommend it for nine-year-olds. I would definitely recommend it for ninth-graders and up even though the writing style is very simplistic ... perfect for a young reader. It is also a good introduction for those who may not have read books about the Holocaust before. It's simple, short and very intense. If you're a parent, I would suggest that you read it before your child does. You'll understand why after reading it.    Bruno is a nine-year-old boy who had to leave the comforts of his Berlin home when his father received a promotion and was sent to Auschitz Concentration Camp (Out-With) by the orders of the Fury (Fuhrer). Bruno is also a very naive boy who didn't know what his father was doing (which I do believe is strongly possible since the Nazis were very protective of their children and didn't want them to know the crimes that their fathers were doing), but he peeked out of a bedroom window and saw a bunch of people wearing pajamas. Curiousity got the better of him and he discovered Shumel, a boy behind the fence wearing pajamas. They striked up a friendship.     It is a very short read and a powerful read too. It is really ideal for first time readers of the Holocaust. It is surprising and told from a naive boy's point of view. We adults can fill in the blanks between the lines ....    It may not be the best book on the Holocaust, but it sure is a good book and definitely will haunt you long after the last page has been turned. You will not forget Bruno so easily especially when he asks his friend why people hate the Jews so much.    7/8/09

These controllers are a little heavier than the sixaxis that comes with the PlayStation3 I believe it is because of the mechanism that causes the rumble.<br /><br />If there is a downside to this controller it would have to be the price and lack of USB cable. I really hope that eventually Sony drops the price down after a little while with this thing out on the street and of course when they discontinue the non-dualshock3.<br /><br />This is a great controller and worth the price if you want a heavier controller or the rumble.

B000HWZ4A2|1.0|Super star Gary Cooper was one year shy of the half-century mark when he lobbied, and to the horror of many, was awarded one of the most coveted male roles in movie history: Howard Roark. As described in Ayn Rand's still exhilirating masterpiece, The Fountainhead, Roark was a l9/20-year-old brilliant social rebel who battled society to live the way he wanted to and to build buildings the way he designed them. He was a dynamic, feisty, fearless rebel who moved and talked like the genius he was.<br /><br />The book starts off with Roark being kicked out of college because he refused to compromise his dreams of becoming not a good architect, but a great one.<br /><br />When Warner Brothers announced it had brought the movie rights to Ayn Rand's landmark novel, many in the film colony saw the Howard Roark part as a shoo-in for rebel-in-residence John Garfield. Charismatic, intense, gorgeous, a brillant artist, he had already created a niche in movies with his bad boy, smart, edgy roles,like the one in the Joan Crawford hit, \\"Humoresque\\" where he proved unforgettable as the troubled, snarling master violinist, Paul Boray.<br /><br />Cooper's image in private and on screen was that of a laconic, good-natured boy-next-door who might have parked his horse outside. Very rarely did he move or talk fast and his style was slow-moving and sleepy. In his role of Howard Roark he looks like the grandfather of the young rebel. Probably one of the most excruitiating scenes on film is Roark's big courtroom speech. Cooper resembles an old man, or an ageing cowpoke,whose wandered onto the wrong set, reading text off a teleprompter and at times his eyes bug out at some of the really high tone philosophy that author Ayn Rand wrote.<br /><br />Cooper was later to say that he understood nothing aboutt the script or his role.  Director King Vidor was later to write that he was appalled by the casting because equally badly cast was Patricia Neal in the juicy role of Roark's love interest--icy, brilliant, surreal Dominique Francon. Neal was a pretty, fresh-faced ingenue who photographed well.<br /><br />Again, many in the film colony thought Ida Lupino was the perfect actress for the role. She was considered the \\"poor man's Bette Davis\\" and had turned in extraordinary performances in \\"They Drive By Night\\" and \\"The Hard Way.\\" Rand said she wrote the Dominique Francon character and later the Dagney Taggart personae in \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" with Greta Garbo in mind. But Garbo had already quit movies.

B002EULANU|5.0|For all you Maxwell lovers out there (like myself) you will be happy to know this CD is the first in a trilogy - BLACK is the first release which will be follwed by SUMMERS and lastly NIGHT.  Each subsequent release will only get us anticipating the next...at least this disc will hold us until the next installation.  This CD will not disappoint, kudos to Maxwell!
B0017ANAZO|4.0|I was actually pretty shocked to see the bad reviews. The Women is a much more realistic version of Sex and the City.   The movie is funny, even though the main character Mary is dealing with the issue of infidelity. The movie is inspiring in the fun women-movie way in which you watch another woman recapture her dreams after being crushed. Mary is a cute, fun person who has put her whole life on hold building the perfect marriage, home, and raising a daughter. All too often women do this. It takes her marriage falling apart to realize this.   The acting by Eva Mendez,and Jada Pinkett Smith was not great, and I love both of those ladies. I think this is Meg Ryan in one of her finest roles. She is so believable in the role of Mary. Debra Messing also does a great job as Edie the hippie mother. Anette Benning is the sharp, quick witted best friend. I think it's a fun movie for women to watch.

Also, there are no option for biginner or some one with knee or back problem.   The movements are not bad, but becareful with your knee and back.
B0013FNC38|3.0|Nice CD. I bought it because of the one famous song: 'I´m yours' which is just great. The rest of it is nice, but not like 'I´m yours'. In the first CD-Delivery was no CD...but amazon sent me another one...So, it is just an \\"OK\\" for the music. I thought, there would be more like I`m yours!!

0060589280|1.0|A friend asked me to read this book because I am Brazilian. I get that a lot, I should like something Brazilian because I am Brazilian. I will finish reading this book, but first I have to vent about how insulting this book is to all women. I was raised a Brazilian woman; I know how to behave as such. The stereotype you probably know about Brazilian women fits most of us, because we were bred that way. This book, just like many things in the Brazilian culture, is a man's view into what women are, what and how women think and behave, and how man knows best about women. To sum up, the main character Maria visits her hero at his house and he tells her that: \\"I need you, Maria. Because you have a light, although I don't really think you believe me yet, and think I'm trying to seduce you with my words...\\" Oh, this is absurd! A man that has just met a woman can see a light in her that - supposedly - this intelligent woman can not see on herself. Give me a break.     The story in this book is unintelligent, trivial, and stereotypical of a Brazilian man writing about women.
B00186K7EE|5.0|I have this film on VHS and trust me I will NEVER sell or get rid of it! I am actually planning on transferring it to DVD at home since VHS eventually goes bad and I wouldn't be able to watch it anymore! I want to keep this film forever! Great film...RIP Michael Jackson! I grew up watching him (in 3-D)at Epcot as Captain Eo and watching him on Moonwalker and of course all of his amazing music videos! Very sad that he passed away so young. He will forever be the greatest entertainer of all time!
0156421178|5.0|I read Orwell's memoir in preparation for (and during) my second visit to Barcelona. Orwell is so English in his outlook, and clearly loves the people of Catalonia.  The book is an excellent review of many of the issues involved in the Spanish Civil war, and how people's fates were decided so clearly by expediency and political whim. Having read _Animal Farm_ and _1984_ as required reading in some prehistoric educational experience, it was refreshing to be inside the head of a much more personal Orwell than I remembered. It was also particularly meaningful to read about places with which I was becoming increasingly familiar. The book was written before the end of the Civil War, and published around the time of Orwell's death in 1950, but it feels so very much in the present. I would place this little book and Zafon's _Shadow of the Wind_ on the \\"must read\\" list for anyone either planning to visit or recently returned from Barcelona.

My only real complaint is that the case is cracked and the adhesive from the tape that kept the case closed won't come off - making it want to stick to the other DVD cases it's next to in my collection (or anything else the it comes in contact with).

This DVD is intense, however it works.  You wouldn't think that you could get a good workout from a DVD, but you can with this one.  I lost 13 pounds in a month doing the DVD 5-6 times a week.  It has three levels and you move up when you are ready.  I just moved up to level 3 and cannot believe the things I am doing.  Jumping jacks with weights??
0345495004|3.0|I really don't like giving three-star reviews, because it feels so wishy-washy, but in this case it is appropriate because I had incredibly mixed feelings about \\"Loving Frank.\\"  Reading this novel was a real roller-coaster ride for me.  I now wish I had read it with a book club because I am sure sharp opinions would fly, making for an interesting discussion.    Most problematically, I did not really buy the relationship between Mamah and Frank, especially in the beginning.  The author did not adequately convey their passion, their connection, as something that was worth tearing their lives and families apart to allow them to be together.      As I plodded on, Mamah's character study did grow on me, even though the decisions she made were utterly despicable in so many ways.  I became interested in this woman though, someone who had been derided by headlines but whose story was eventually lost from the public consciousness.    Just when I had started to care about Mamah, and wondered how her story would all turn out, the ending galloped up and totally blindsided me.  (I read the book on the Kindle so I didn't realize how close I was to the conclusion.)  Now admittedly, Nancy Horan had to fit her plot around the facts of history, but when I found out Mamah's story ended, I could not imagine anyone looking at this narrative and deciding to construct a romantic novel about it.    I was tempted to give the book two stars, but the truth is that after recovering from the punch to the gut that concludes this story, I have found that I am interested in learning more about how Mamah fits into Frank Lloyd Wright's larger life story.  \\"Loving Frank\\" is told from Mamah's point of view, and her relationship with Frank did last the rest of her life.  Frank, however, lived another 45 years and experienced a lot more drama around his work, his artist colony at Taliesin, and eventual relationships with two more wives.  I plan to read [[ASIN:0670020419 The Women: A Novel]] by T. C. Boyle, another account of Wright's love life, to get the bigger picture.  I have a feeling that Mamah's choices and sacrifices will look ever more questionable once we see Wright through a more objective perspective than the filter of Mamah's loving adoration.    Still, credit goes out to Nancy Horan for bringing the human side of Frank Lloyd Wright's history to life, and for the illumination of the fascinating and flawed Mamah Borthwick Cheney.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I had to see the film after hearing \\"Falling Slowly\\" on AI.  Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are unspoiled musicians who make amazing music both separately and together.  I love the simple style in which the film was shot, spotlighting the sweet honesty of life for these two characters - named \\"girl\\" and \\"guy\\".  Don't be put off by the F-word in the beginning.  In other countries it's more of a typical vocabulary word than in the states.  If you love music and good story lines, you should really see this.  At least ONCE.  : )

B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is not the music that the majority hears and finds love for instantly. It is often dissonant and it's odd time signatures and complex song structures make this album more than just relaxing music. But it's involving music. The album is more of an full body and mind experience than a mere collection of songs. I think this is alot of inspired bands try to accomplish but its not easy.<br /><br />Each song from the album has a way of reaching inside of you and holding a mirror infront of you. You come face to face with yourself, and not only Maynard's compelling lyrics but also the instrumentals' sheer power/ contemplative ambience bring you to another place.<br /><br />Well that was kind of deep. The best part about this, is that once you do love it, the music can touch anyone on any level. No matter what your life is like, you will find something in Aenima. You will have a new perspective of yourself, the world and humanity as a whole. Pry open your third eye and give this album/ experience an oppourtunity to engulf you.

0316154687|2.0|I was bemoaning the fact that I am busy the night David Sedaris is appearing nearby. If he is going to read from \\"When You Are Engulfed In Flames\\", I am not upset that I will be missing it. I thought about 3 of the 20 or so stories in the book were funny - no where near as many laugh-out-loud moments as in \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" which I recently reread. Many stories were disgusting and/or vulgar without the payoff of a laugh (Hugh lancing David's boil shows love but I didn't need to read about it). Other stories had a tone of \\"look at me - aren't I quirky?\\" such as the one where David feeds his pet spiders flies or David awkwardly tries to make small talk. I am wondering if he has milked dry the truly funny parts of his life - like his childhood and family. Now he spends so much time on planes and doing book tours that several stories are set in planes and taxis - and the material just isn't that good. I was disappointed!

It's great the film did well for her, but her comedic pratfalls are always predictable and she fails (once again) as a producer. Margaret's transformation is too black and white. The movie looks and feels cheap. The only thing the film confirms is that this is all that Sandra Bullock is capable of. Sad.    The one thing the film does have is Betty White. I will always love Betty White.

I'm a white boy, like apparently most Blues fans these days (that's another story). Being where I come from musically one thing I noticed is how much this stuff straight-up **rocks**. Yeah it is technically post-war Chicago electric Blues. Put whatever technically correct label ya want. It kicks ---. Sun Record founder Sam Phillips discovered Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Ray Orbison, BB King, Jerry Lee Louis, Charlie Rich, and Howlin' Wolf. Phillips said Elvis was his *second* greatest discovery and Howlin' Wolf was his greatest. Sam Phillips: \\"When I heard Howlin' Wolf, I said, 'This is for me. This is where the soul of man never dies'. The greatest sight you could see would be Howlin' Wolf doing one of those sessions in my studio. God, what it would be worth to see the veins on his neck, and buddy there was nothing on his mind but that song. He sang with his damn soul!...\\"
0143034901|2.0|This is quite a poor novel. Let me list the reasons why:<br /><br />- the plot is full of ridiculously contrived coincidences that exist purely in order to conveniently advance the storyline. For instance, the main character, Daniel, is trying to trace the history of Julian Carax. He goes to a number of different locations from Carax's past. At each location, there just happens to be standing right there, at the moment Daniel arrives, someone who, first, knows the detailed history of the location and of Julian Carax's involvement, and second, is willing to share it with Daniel, a complete stranger.<br /><br />This happens about five times! For example, Daniel goes to an old abandoned mansion where nobody has lived for about a decade. He stands at the front gate. Lo and behold, the caretaker is right there, and he knows the complete family history and has no qualms in sharing it with a stranger! A few chapters later Daniel goes to Carax's old school. Lo and behold, the first person they see is a priest who just happened to have been in the same class as Carax twenty years ago! And sure, he'll give a complete and detailed description of everything Daniel needs to know to keep the plot moving.<br /><br />It's childish plotting like this that reminds me of a Scooby Doo mystery. Everything occurs so conveniently.<br /><br />- the characters are all clich&eacute;d, one-dimensional, flat, and lack any depth at all. The bad guy is just plain evil all of the time, with no other facets to his personality. Tragic characters are purely tragic, etc. Not a single character in this book represents a real life human being. In fact, all of the characters are merely plot devices.<br /><br />- there is no character development at all. Every character is essentially the same at the end as the beginning, apart from their age. However, even the aging of the characters doesn't have any effect on them. Daniel's personality or maturity does not change at all over the course of the novel even though he presumably goes through puberty and adolescence and into adulthood.<br /><br />- at the end we are given a ridiculously implausible letter that oh-so-conveniently ties up all of the loose ends of the story.<br /><br />- without giving too much away, there is a terribly clich&eacute;d twist about 400 pages in that is so overused I was embarrassed to read it.<br /><br />- the book is overly melodramatic and tries very hard to be dark and gothic but comes across as florid and cringe-worthy pastiche.<br /><br />- the language itself is generally quite plodding and merely functional at best.

0312944926|1.0|I'd rank his books in this order (first to worst): The DaVinci Code; Angels & Demons; Deception Point; and this turkey. Do not read this book -- you will regret it.  The characters are supposed to be some of the smartest people in the world, and they are as dumb as a box of hammers. And while I have been able to suspend disbelief in his other books because they were just so much fun, I couldn't do it in this book, because it is NO fun. It was written around 1998 -- when we were gearing up for Y2K and the whole world was installing a trillion safe guards around the systems and data.  Who would believe that the NSA wouldn't have better security on their systems/data?  The villain is obvious from about the first minute he speaks.  Again: do not read this book.  You'll be so sorry you wasted your time.

B001LRJH0U|3.0|The one movie genre we make well in America is the Western and as a fan of Ed Harris and Vigo Mortensen I had high hopes for Appaloosa.  Disappointed is not the right word for how I felt after watching it but somehow the movie didn't quite achieve what other modern Westerns like Wyatt Earp achieved. It was well acted, well shot, the pace was sometimes a little slow but a Western has to somehow be an 'epic' to work: like The Good The Bad and The Ugly. So maybe it just wasn't ambitious enough. Worth watching though.

But he agrees to the operation anyway, although he is still dubious about its effects.<br /><br />However the operation DOES start to work its magic on Charlie's brain, and as an adjunct to his recovery and growth he befriends Algernon, the laboratory mouse, and becomes fast friend withthis little clever being.<br /><br />And as Charlie's mind grows and his IQ starts to soar, we are treated to a delightful exploration and discovery of the world of knowledge and understanding and ... love?....<br /><br />But as Charlies' mind grows, it takes over his very being, and MY mind was beginning to flip flop and race madly to nowhere, like a hamster in a wheel, as I tried to keep up with Charlie's maddening brain growth and his attitutde towards his world, and his beloved Alice, his doctors, and his mother.<br /><br />But then...the \\"hamster wheel\\" starts rolling backwards, and... things...start...to...slooow....down in Charlie's brain.<br /><br />And as Algernon, whom Charlie dearly loves and identifies with, also starts to slow down and then...die.... so does Charlie's IQ, until he returns to that from whence he started.<br /><br />But what a wild ride it was -- to and from that destination.<br /><br />And brilliantly written.

0140157352|5.0|\\"Getting to Yes\\" promotes effective non-confrontational negotiation.<br /><br />The most common negotiating technique is to take a position and budge as little from it as possible. This is misguided.<br /><br />The first and foremost principle of \\"Getting to Yes\\" is to base negotiations not on position but on interests. Even something as simple as deciding the amount of rent an apartment is worth involves interests that can help negotiations if mentioned. The landlord hopes the prospective tenant is quiet while the tenant the landlord hopes the landlord will maintain the premises. Each party's total interests should weigh in the balance when negotiating the lease.<br /><br />It helps negotiations progress we understands our counterparty's interests, when we put ourselves in their place. The point is not to sympathize with the other party and be more open to giving in, but rather to be able to make more effective offers.<br /><br />The authors also give many key phrases that help avoid or defuse tense situations. It's a good idea to practice the following sample out loud in front of a mirror before an actual negotiating round.<br /><br />*Please correct me if I'm wrong but...<br />*Could I ask you a few questions to see if my facts are right?<br />*Let me see if I understand what you are saying...<br />*We appreciate what you've done for us...<br />*Our concern is fairness...<br />*Trust is a separate issue. (When asked \\"Don't you trust us?\\")<br />*What is the principle behind your action/decision?<br />*We'd like to settle this on the basis of independent standards...<br /><br />The last two phrases fit with another technique advocated by the authors: to base negotiating decisions on independent principles. For instance, with rent, independent standards include the rent for other similar apartments in the same neighborhood and legal constraints on raising rents more than a certain percentage. Independant standards allow parties to reach an agreement without seeming to give in to each other.<br /><br />As good as it is, no book on anything will make the reader an expert.

0553582038|1.0|Let me restate:  all of the main characters that we love so well from the first 3 books DO NOT appear in a Feast for Crows!  To be honest at the end of Storm of Swords I didn't see how Martin was going to salvage his tattered masterpiece.  Killing and resuscitating Catelyn, killing Robb, dismissing Joras, parting Arya from Sandor, kicking Tyrion out of King's Landing, having Jon turn down Winterfell...  the point is this series might just be over.  Martin's new characters are wooden and one-dimensional.  Brienne the determined, Ceries the frantic, Jaime the weak...  these characters were far more interesting in their previous incarnations.  I couldn't even finish this book.
0385751893|3.0|There seems to be some confusion over whether the narrator is the main character. Although set up as third-person, the narrator's voice is often that of the child, yet at other times, capable of noticing things that don't seem likely, such as the cook's face showing lines of once sporting a beard (an observation which also seemed to spell out a bit too clearly that the cook was a Jew: it certainly seemed obvious to me from the description and events prior to the mention of missing facial hair).<br /><br />Apart from the narration issues which dampened my enjoyment of the book, the story is believable and interesting to read. The ending seemed all too obvious, and I think I felt more compassion for the boy's mother's situation rather than his own. Perhaps nine-year-old boys reading this story feel differently.
B0013D8LCW|4.0|Sometimes, some very rare times, there comes a person in our lives who pushes us and forces us to become better; who helps us to figure out who we are meant to be. But sometimes this person is not the one we've always thought s/he would be. And some unfortunate times, we let this person go.<br />This movie deals with this dillemma: A guy is inspired by another, who happens to be his best friend's older brother, and ends up falling for him - completely against everything's he's ever known.<br />His journey dealing with that and starting to think about what *he* really wants - not his sister, not anybody else, what HE wants - is truly not be missed. This is a wonderful movie that hopefully will be 'discovered' by more and more people in the future.
0375842209|5.0|Well, after hearing Marcus speaking about wanting to create everybody's favourite book, I can confirm that he succeeded for me. The Book Thief has made it into my top ten books of all time, which meant I was severely disappointed when I got to the end and there was no more to read: I need more. His beautifully written story really motivated me to start reading a lot more after years of being a bit lazy. I look forward to reading more from this author.

0765318741|5.0|Wonderfully fast paced and extremely well written don't begin to do this gem of a book justice. Written in 1954!!! I'm in awe - it is that good.<br /><br />I'm not gonna go on about the plot or characters, other reviews do that.<br /><br />I rented it from the Library, because I liked the deeply flawed movie. The movie in only very minor ways matches the book. The book IS better. WAY. BETTER. I loved it. You will too - go read it.
B000UJ48U4|1.0|This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. It's full of vulgarity and one of the most nonsensical story lines ever created. As a result, I will never watch another movie with Cruise or Kidman in it. It was a total waste of so-called talent. Cruise seemed to think that everything was funny, with the stupid grin on his face, almost through the entire movie and Kidman didn't have any qualms about using the F-word, no matter how many moviegoers she might be offending. This has to be one of the worst movies Stanley Kubrick ever directed and it's a black mark on his movie-making career.
0439023491|5.0|When I read the Hunger Games, I read it straight through the night, from 1AM til 5AM. Couldn't stop reading even though I had to pee badly. After I finished it, I was dying for the sequel. DYING!!!! When I found out the ARC would be available in the spring, I bribed everyone I could think of to get me one. And yes, I got it. The day I got it, I couldn't look at it until 1AM  again. This time, I promised myself, I would only look at the first chapter and then put it down. Riiiiight. It was 4:30AM when I finished reading and immediately began plotting to find out when the next book ARC would be available.<br /><br />I thought the first one was fantastic. In the back of my mind I felt that the sequel just couldn't be as good. How could it? Boy was I wrong! It was even better! My heart was racing the whole time I was reading it and I simply couldn't put it down. I believe Ms. Collins is the MASTER of the pageturner. Every chapter ends with almost a cliffhanger feeling. It compels you to keep reading. It physically traps you into the book so that you just can't put it down. If you can't read this book in one sitting, then I urge you not to even look at it until you can. Like the first one, you will not be able to put it down. The house could have been on fire and I doubt I would have noticed.<br /><br />Since we got to know Peeta and Katniss so well from the first one, what the sequel does is invest us even more deeply into their emotional well being. I won't give any other spoilers than what has already been said. So the book starts with Katniss as the face of the rebellion because of her act of defiance in the first book. As rebellion grows, the President sets up his revenge - and when I found out what it was, I literally sat up in bed and shouted \\"Oh NO! I can't believe they are doing this to them!!!\\" Yes I was talking to my book. That's how deeply this book sucks you into this amazing and disturbing dystopian world. It makes you want to grab up a weapon and join the rebellion.<br /><br />One thing I have to say, I was deeply satisfied with the ending of this book. The first book ended in such a way that I was bothered by it and itchy for the next book. With the end of Catching Fire, I felt it was absolutely right and thrilled with the conclusion. But I'm still DYING for the third and final book of this amazing book series.rebellion.<br /><br />One thing I have to say, I was deeply satisfied with the ending of this book.

B000E41MS6|5.0|Russell T. Davies had a problem in 2004.  His problem was how to restart Doctor Who, the great British science fiction television series that had died a slow death in the 1980s, primarily due to shoddy writing and stale characterizations.       Then he remembered the basic rule of good-to-great science fiction.  It isn't the situations...it's the characters.  We learned this when Ronald D. Moore and David Eick reworked Battlestar Galactica.     To that end, I felt that RTD really treated the four seasons he ran production more as a 52-episode story that was told in four chapters.  This First Series Set plays more as a laying of the baseline for the 21st-Century Time Lord and those around him.  Davies seems willing to lay more of the Doctor's emotions out.  There is the irreverence and stream of thought that has usually played through the character's recent history, but Davies--through Christopher Eccelston's interpretation--starts laying the Doctor bare at times.  The Ninth Doctor doesn't wear the scarf of Tom Baker, the celery boutonniere of Peter Davidson, or the straw hat of Sylvester McCoy.  Davies starts this with a subtle reminder that, in spite of his name, what The Doctor is...is a warrior.  Whether considered a soldier or superhero, Eccelston's Doctor is a black-wearing, short-haired survivor of a conflict that wiped out his planet.  He can be severe, angry, feral and snappish all in a matter of moments.  He also hurts--he's alone.     This is where Davies' thought process begins to percolate around the character.  He starts in this season to introduce \\"The Family of Time/Children of Time\\" concept--his Companions , the cohorts who aid and support (sometimes unwillingly), and a world that goes beyond his travels in the TARDIS (Which absolutely could NEVER change from its 1950's Police Box camouflage).  In many ways it is a broader vision than what we had in the first run, and opens up new avenues for the Doctor's world.  This allows Billie Piper's RoseTyler--the Family of Time's First Lady--to be the soul and the conscience the Doctor so desperately needs.  Piper is allowed to give a strength to Rose that we haven't seen in the Companion's roles before (Or at least since Sarah Jane Smith), and all the while look absolutely adorable.  She saves the Doctor's life twice within the first six episodes--in the premiere/return episode \\"Rose\\" and at the conclusion of the \\"Aliens In London/World War III\\" storyline.  In \\"Dalek\\", Rose actually challenges the Doctor AND the infamous robot enemy in a way no Companion had.       If Rose is the Family of Time's First Lady, Camille Courdi's Jackie Tyler is the Queen Mother--her first meeting with the Doctor is a wonderfully hilarious moment of attempted seduction crushed--and Noel Clarke's Mickey Smith is the reluctant entrant.  Having been the boyfriend of Rose when she met the Doctor, Mickey is the one who study's the Doctor's history and realizes the danger of being around him--yet, he finds himself working with the Doctor; even saving the world from itself in \\"World War III\\".     But the character that knocks it out of the park in Series 1 is John Barrowman's Jack Harkness.  Introduced in \\"The Empty Child\\", Harkness is the knight errant of the Family--born in the 51st century, Jack would seemingly prefer being a thief to his moments of heroism...that is, if he could get his mind off of getting some.  With anyone.  Or anything.  The explanation of Jack--in the 51st century, the former Time Agent comes from a time where the term \\"omnisexual\\" is used.  That explains Jack, short of using the term \\"male ho\\".     While expanding the base of the people surrounding the Doctor, RTD also expands the physical world of the Doctor.  In \\"The Unquiet Dead\\", the Doctor and Rose travel back to 1869 and meet Charles Dickens in Cardiff, Wales.  Finding themselves in an investigation of corpses reanimating at a funeral home, the Doctor discovers the funeral home sits on a time/space rift that is capable of allowing extraterrestrials to move into this world and dimension.  That rift becomes a part of the Doctor's universe about 145 years later...but that's for another review.     It is the finish to the season--the two-parter \\"Bad Wolf\\" and \\"The Parting Of the Ways\\"--that set the transition from Eccelston to David Tennant, and the course for Captain Jack...but also the level of strength and devotion to The Doctor that Rose shows; a part of the four-part storyline that runs deep.     This first chapter of Doctor Who's return is a fascinating watch, made all the more fascinating by the first season being Eccelston's only season as The Doctor.  Among the special features is Eccelston's BBC interview before the premier episode was shown in England, an odd moment because one realizes that Chris knows he's completed his run--leading to his mentioning of regeneration.     All in all, the return of Doctor Who to television has been a wonderful view--it hasn't been reimaged as severely (Though to its benefit) the way that Battlestar Galactica was, but it comes off as a diamond long-buried, found and--thanks to Russell T. Davies--well polished...and well done.       Season/Series 1--highly recommended.
0312427999|4.0|Fifty years ago, Eisenhower warned his public about the Military Industrial Complex. Flash forward to 2007, Naomi Klein warns her public about the morphing of that sector into the Disaster Capitalism Complex, a shapeless movement informed by free market idealogs and their direct government connections.    The painstakingly assembled book tries to coherently answer that dodgiest of questions, \\"Why is the west so hated around the world?\\" Trying her best to connect the dots through recently unsealed public documents, miles of quotations by relevant public and private figures, interviews of credible witnesses and documentation supported by forty pages of footnotes, Klein comes the closest I've read to explaining how the machinations of capitalism have wrought destruction on tiny nations of which some folks may never have heard.    Citing examples ripped from yesterday and today's headlines, from Pinochet's Chile to Hurricane Katrina, Klein draws a line between the casual Wall Street investor and the planned disaster strategist. It's a tall order to peel back the layers of history to reveal the role of psychological warfare techniques on the stock market, but in the end, the book makes twisted sense. History is full of commentators who studied the relationships between war and economic policy; here the commentary is about the rise of an economy that thrives on natural and man-made misery and investor determination to encourage its survival.    Even though opinion on this view of economic history may provoke partisan agendas, \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" makes for essential reading, even if Klein admits the lines drawn from some accusations are inconclusive. The reader may find her rhetoric arrogantly dismissive, but the fact is, her discoveries made her passionately critical of the current political headwinds. She also is unapologetic over her family's socialist tendencies, and that may be enough for some readers to cry foul. It's important to start this book without preconceptions and let it work on your personal biases because, in the end, one can judge the book an opinion piece. At the very least, Klein's arguments will slam your notion of 20th century history on its ear.
B0025T65GC|5.0|I have tried to get into DT in the past and I didn't like the \\"Wall of Sound\\". This album (at least temporarily) moves away from that, but yet each song still contain depth and layers. After listening to this about 10 times, I am starting to buy other DT albums and now appreciate them. Other reviews have stated the album is uneven and some have been disappointed that it is not as heavy as previous albums, but what this album is, is one of the most creative, diverse and beautiful pieces of rock ever created. I think, like myself, many people will be attracted to this album and then desire to check all of Devin's past discography. This is one of those albums that I know I will go back and listen to over and over again, and appreciate it in new ways every time i listen to it.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|The original Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children was a feast for the eyes. It's set two years after the end of the original game, and can be best categorized as fan-service, a 90 minute cutscene with a convoluted script. For all it's flaws I still liked it.<br /><br />Advent Children Complete is a better movie than Advent Children. The script has been overhauled. The original had some dialogue that didn't seem to flow very well when translated into English, as a result several plot lines and details felt unclear, but Complete's script rewrites the dialogue and speeches, giving much better explanations and making all the dialogue sound much more fluid to the American ear.<br /><br />Of course that isn't the only improvement. The extra 30 minutes of footage add a layer of depth to the story, and the action scenes that were redone or changed are even better than before. The changes in the fight between Sephiroth and Cloud in particular stand out in my mind. It goes without saying that the entire movie looks better on Blu-Ray, as a CG film it benefits from being redone in HD.<br /><br />I believe that this version of the film should replace any previous version in anyone's BRD/DVD/Movie collection.
0736041850|5.0|I've completely looked through about 40 artist anatomy books in book stores and owned 4 total. Overtime I've given them all away as they just were not what I needed. In the end they always have a semi-athletic body drawn in a variety of poses and invariably show the muscles etc. Even \\"Anatomy For Fantasy Artists\\" does the same thing, basic break down of a healthy athlete and then later on there is 4 whole drawings of a muscle bound weightlifter.    This book however is chock full of every angle you need to reference muscle bound comic characters like the Incredible Hulk. Flexing, stretching, hunching, standing, it has it all. The quality of the art on the front of this book is replicated on every single page throughout. It also explains muscle groups, names, the whole nine yards like typical artists anatomy books.    This book won't teach you facial expressions, or dynamic hand and foot anatomy. If you want that buy Burne Hogarth's books. This just has tons of heavily muscled ripped anatomy from any and all reference points you need.    I've been searching for a book like this forever, collected weight lifting photo's and more exagerated artists work such as Staples, Bisley, Keown, Bonner and gobs more. For the first time I feel that I am satisfied in a book for my heavier muscled artistic references.      I was wondering if I should get Women's Strength Training Anatomy as a companion guide to this book but their is actually a totally adequate section towards the end greatly detailing women's anatomy. Perfect really.    Highly recommended if you are into drawing comic book style muscled figures and more.
B0000009SM|5.0|Well it's far from his best...but it's sure as hell his most coheisive release ever. One Size Fits All best sums up Frank Zappa's 1970's feel and sound with one solid swoop. Combining some of his greatest, most crative and eccentric arrangements with some of the greatest instrumentation he had ever played with, along side some of the most ridiculous lyrics he ever wrote. This works most of the time on tracks like the fabulous 'San Ber'dino' and not so well on others like the downright boring 'Florentine Pogen.'<br /><br />Something must be said for songs like the Xylophone infected 'Inca Roads' and the killer 'Po-Jama People' with it's over the top guitar solo that makes even the strongest of Zappas work blush. And with the German sang closer 'Sofa No. 2' it may not be Zappa and the Mothers of Inventions best work but it is easily one of the most entertaining and commercially exceptable.

George was the songwriter Beatle every bit as much as Moe & Larry or whatever the other two were called.

Once upon a time.....Far away....In a Cracker Box Palace filled with Old Brown Shoes, Weeping Guitars and Taxmen....So the important thing is to Beware of Darkness, resist The Devil's Radio and remember \\"If You Don't Know Where You're Going, Any Road Will Take You There\\".

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|I would like to say that despite the fact that there are inferior DVD transfers of McLintock! out there from other video companies, the John Wayne Foundation's endorsement of this particular version (with its high-quality color, sound, and picture integrity) make it the only version worth considering for purchase.  You will want to watch it again and again!
B000063DIR|1.0|There are two personnel problems with this Ozzy album.  I grew up believing that Tommy Aldridge (Black Oak Arkansas, Pat Travers Band) was on drums on _Diary of a Madman_.  What did we know, here in Eugene, Oregon, in 1981-82?  Indeed, Aldridge found a live job with Ozzy, but I don't recognize the name of the studio guy... NOR THE NAMES OF THE RERECORDED GUYS ON THIS CD.  Listen to the other reviewers who admonish buying the CD with the smaller image and OZZY down the right side.  Believe me, the drumming on this particular version sucks.  Sounds like an amateur compared with Aldridge with Pat Travers on _Go For What You Know_.  I don't know much about Sarzo, except he should've been on this album.  I was very disappointed in my purchase; I felt stupid having bought it.  It was as if the vocals and guitar were the only things that mattered - when any savvy pro musician will tell you that the rhythm section is the backbone of any band.  These morons, when they rerecord over the original tracks, lose the original pulse by some percentage every time they record over, so that the whole thing is floating on essentially nothing.  Somebody tell me if I'm wrong.  Thank you.<br /><br />Also, if you like Tommy Aldridge from your experience of _Bark at the Moon_, go back to his time with Pat Travers (_Heat in the Street_, _Go for What You Know_, and _Crash and Burn_).  Happy listening.
6304696566|4.0|My title refers to the  year (1998), that this particular version of \\"The Searchers\\" was transferred to DVD.  There are morer recent transfers than this one, but my research has shown that this one has the best overall quality.  It does justice to what is arguably John Wayne's best film.  Enjoy!  My rating shows four stars.  I typed that by mistake.  In my opinion, this DVD rates five-star treatment!

I was so excited to see how it all turned out but sad that it was the end. Well I got a ways in and just had to close the book in frustration. What was this? What happened? Why on earth did it turn this way? There were so many beautiful, exciting ways I could see this turning out and never in a million years did my brain go in that direction. Pregnant? Ugh! As soon as I read that I am like you have got to be kidding me right. WHY? Why did she ruin this?   The first three novels in the series where Awesome. I couldn't put them down. This one I just had to get through just to to get through it. Was not the happy ending I was looking for! Would of rated it a zero stars if they let me.
B0009X7664|5.0|Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is a beautiful and extraordinarily intelligent novel, and this is a beautiful and extraordinarily intelligent adaptation. Almost everything about this film is flawless. From the script and the acting, to the cinematography to the music, it deserves its status as a classic monumental film. There's no doubt that Gregory Peck reveals his timeless acting abilities as Atticus Finch. It's a stunning performance, and this performance alone will never become extinct in the legacies of motion pictures. Like the book, this film teaches a very important lesson on racism old and new. Some changes had been made, but I hope readers won't mind, since this IS a film adaptation.<br /><br />To Kill A Mockingbird stands on its own as a classic film. Mixed with dark humor and very fierce drama, this is a film that will never be lost in the shadows.<br /><br />Grade: A+
B000000OSE|3.0|A previous reviewer praised this album by challenging the reader to just buy one \\"Use Your Illusion\\" without becoming tempted to buy the other. To that, I'd reply \\"Mission Accomplished.\\"    This is allegedly the more \\"hard rock\\" oriented of the two, but unfortunately all the songs that rock as hard as \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" (\\"Back Off B****,\\" \\"Right Next Door to Hell,\\" \\"Perfect Crime,\\" \\"Don't Damn Me,\\" etc.) also happen to be obvious filler. This isn't a problem per se since I listen to all types of music, but I don't think the other tracks manage to compensate.    On the ballad side of things, \\"November Rain\\" is of course a candidate for GnR's all-time best song, and despite being a rote imitation, GnR's version of \\"Live and Let Die\\" tops McCartney's original. By contrast, \\"Don't Cry\\" has some merits, but is basically just a banal monster ballad. \\"Coma\\" is a heavy 10-minute epic that some people love, but I personally don't think it goes anywhere.    In the middle are most of the album's better songs, tracks in the \\"not quite hard rock\\" mold of Aerosmith and the Rolling Stones. These include \\"Dust and Bones,\\" \\"You Ain't the First,\\" \\"Bad Obsession,\\" and \\"The Garden.\\" These are all solid tracks, but they can't bear the weight of being the best songs on the album. They certainly don't transcend the band's influences or form a compelling artistic statement like \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" did.    Honestly, I've mulled over this album for over a month, and I don't see how any track other than \\"November Rain\\" can be considered essential.

I pre-ordered this cd and received it on the day of the actual release and was not disappointed.  I have listened to the cd several times and find something else to enjoy about it everytime I hear it.  This is great music, therefore making it a really great listen.

159448385X|5.0|The problem with this book is that I've been hard pressed to find another novel that lives up to the standards set by this one. There are enough reviews that describe it, but the best thing to do is READ IT! I also looked at the 1-star reviews, and while some people didn't like it, it seems to have a lasting effect on everyone who reads it. Some say it is disappointing-but such is life. I couldn't put this book down. This is the only book I've read where my heart was pounding trying to finish it. It made such an impression that I had to take a break from reading just to process what had happened in this novel. I thought about the characters long after I finished the book, and to me, that was part of what made this such a wonderful book--it truly had an effect on me. I'd recommend giving it a chance. It's not for everyone, but it does make a lasting impression!
B000VR824S|5.0|Crossroads 2007 was a guitar lover's dream.  With 30,000 others, I attended the live show.  DVD showed many of the great licks and spirit of the day.  Good to have those memories to play back.  The purchase was hassle-free and in perfect condition.
0446402397|1.0|While `Child 44' may appear entertaining at first, the novel is full of clichés and bland, monotonous dialogue. The characters are unremarkable and poorly developed; the situations are often plain idiotic with an ending worth that of a soap opera. Too many poorly tied up ends, moronic choices and primitive or, more often, exaggerated conflicts.  Unsurprisingly, the novel is also full of goofs. While the author claimed that he had done extensive research of the era and even been consulted by a native Russian person (doh! ever thought about visiting Russia instead before taking upon such a topic?), his attempts to achieve authenticity are laughable at best. While technicalities like messed up names and terminology and also geographical errors may not be relevant to a Western reader (who cares, really, anyway?), the whole retardation of the Stalinist society and everyday life in the 30-50's Russia may not go unnoticed. Also, there are lots of factual errors regarding MGB and NKVD practices and their rank systems.  A rather pitiful debut, if you ask me, penned by a novice who, apparently, cheated his way through a fiction writing course. The book feels more like a messy draft of something that every mature writer would ether rewrite completely or just throw away after a period of gestation as an obviously unsuccessful attempt. Hey, I've thought that &#34;Hannibal Rising&#34; was BAD, but this `opus' left me rather disgusted. I had hard time finishing it, hoping for something better towards the end, yet to only encounter something worse.  What a shame! No wonder this will be made into a film. Way to go!
B001NLL0RW|5.0|The is the first Sigma book I have read and I was unable to put it down.  It was full of action, adventure and how the heck are they going to get out of this one puzzlers.  It was well written and I highly recommend it.
1416914307|3.0|I can't say that I ever LOVED this series but I did enjoy it. In the first book I really liked the relationship between Clary, Jace and Simon. It kept me interested. I admit City of Glass was a page-turner even though it was hopelessly predictable. Maybe Clare was trying to give us hints throughout the boook but she just ended up telling us what would happen. Calling Lake Lyn reflective repeatedly gave away the fact that the lake was the Mirror almost immediately. Calling Jace \\"angelic\\" or talking about how the hair around his head looked like a halo in the sun was just too much. Another thing I wasn't too pleased about was how time seemed to move in the book. Clary and Jace met A MONTH AGO? I almost had to set the book down after that was revealed. I thought that at least 6 months had elapsed from the first book to the last. Maybe I'm a sucker for tragedy but I thought this book wrapped up a little too neatly. Everyone was practically pooping rainbows by the end.    But my review isn't all bad. I really did enjoy the whole backstory with Clary's mom and Valentine. I also liked the element of the angels. I was glad that Clare made Valentine into more of a human being with feelings and not just a ruthless villain.    I would say borrow the book. Don't buy it. It's good but not FANTASTIC.
0765322889|2.0|This is a tough book to review. I really did not enjoy this book, and yet I know I'll read the next one. In fact, it's been about two weeks since I finished GOTM and, although I thought it would be a good long while until I read Deadhouse Gates, I find myself wanting to read it. Very strange.    First of all, let me say this: This is not a great, or even a good, book. In fact, it may be one of the worst fantasy novels I've read in quite some time...since I last read Terry Goodkind maybe (I don't like that guy). Comparisons to George R.R. Martin and/or Robert Jordan are, quite frankly, as absurd as absurd gets. Erickson is not of that caliber, prose wise or plot wise. This is based only on GOTM, though. He may get better and indeed I've heard he does. But in this one the writing is poor. And I do not think it was too complex...I love complex. Chaotic and meandering, yes. Complex...intellectually challenging, not so much. I know there are those who say it's his writing style but I think instead this is a case of the emperor's new clothes. It's just bad writing. The amount of characters was fine with me...but the characterization was horrible. No one seemed to have any consistency to them at all, and I certainly had no invested interest in any of them. Maybe Kruppe, he was ok. The bad guy (I think), Rake, seems like he just stepped out of a Japanese video game...giant sword and all. And the overall being thrown right into the story thing. Great idea, bad execution. I think it would be great to reveal things slowly to the reader, but in this book I didn't even care.    At times this book reads like Dragonball Z meets G.I. Joe. meets Dungeons and Dragons. The ending was like it was lifted from some anime movie. There is a very freewheeling use of magic that seems to have no limits and is used too much to drive the plot forward without explanation.     Okay, now the positive. The world building is pretty awesome and intense. You can tell there was a lot of work put into this. There were occasionally some, not many, but some flashes of brilliance here and there. Every time I'd hit one I kept hoping that that was where the book got really good, but alas...no. But there were flashes...I particularly liked the beginning, which was so much better than the ending, which was ridiculous.    So all in all...two stars. I really wanted to give more. I mean really...and I tried. Just couldn't. But I am going to read the next one. Picked it up already. Who knows maybe Erikson will turn out to be the anti-Goodkind. Maybe he will just get batter and better as he goes along. Hope so.
B00138J7ZC|5.0|You know that experience you have when you put on a new album and instantly you GET IT. I mean... really, deep-down just get it... like it connects to somewhere deep inside of you? That is the experience I had with this album. I mean, YES, I was also scratching my head and going \\"THIS is BRMC?!\\" The sound is SUCH a departure from their other albums. You are simply forced to listen to this album on its own. It cannot be held up and judged next to their other albums (also great, btw) because it's almost like their split personality - a band that belongs in Mississippi in 1935 in a chain gang somewhere. How such an uber-white band of Jesus & Mary Types can wring out such soulful pain is beyond me. But GET this album.   All the songs are incredible but the soul-wrenching songs are: Restless Sinner, Fault Line, Open Invitation, Devil's Waitin', Gospel Song, Sympathetic Noose and The Line (wait, that's almost the whole thing!) See what I mean?   Seriously! Get this album NOW!
B000AMB21O|4.0|I'm not going to write a long review.  \\"Puzzle Box\\" wrote an excellent one, read that for a thorough appreciation of this film.  I just want to warn you that though I recognize it as a great film, it is certainly not for everyone.  I found it to be one of the most disturbing things I have ever seen.  To this day I'm pretty haunted by the film, and honestly, I really, really wish I had never seen it.  I think I'd be a happier person.<br /><br />If you are at all sensitive to having your fears and imagination agitated by bizarre, grisly, and terrifying material, seriously, think twice before you watch this.  I wouldn't show this to at least half the people I know--I value their friendship, and their mental stability, too much.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|I've never ordered a used DVD online until this one.  The price was a steal, the product came in no time and the DVD was in excellent condition and it played as good as new.  Can't ask for more.

0142407542|5.0|This is a great sequel to The Gruffalo which my 3 year old Grandaughter just loves, and she enjoyed this just as much, I have to admit I love both these stories as well and they are my first choice when I am on bed time story duty.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The book series is great, and although the T.V. show starts out very much like the book, the differences increase as it goes along. So if you're looking for an exact match, and are unhappy when story lines/characters are changed this may not be for you.<br />I have loved the T.V. show though, and if you find Twilight a bit 'tweeny' this should make you happy! It's quite dark and definitely *not* for the tweens as is pretty explicit from time to time.<br />Looking forward to season 2!
0151008116|5.0|This is one crazy story, but very funny, although at times gruesome. (Yes, crazy, funny and gruesome.) There are so many reviews, that I won't repeat what others have said, but I loved this one.  The protagonist is wonderfully funny.
0143034901|5.0|All-around this is a great read. It has intrigue, romance, mystery, a well-developed plot line and characters, a good build-up of suspense. I loved it and couldn't put it down.
1416549447|5.0|I love to run, but it always seems that I injure myself even with stretching, etc. I was just walking by the shelf at the library and the Injury-Free Running in the title just jumped out at me. I took it home and read through it in a couple of hours. Started using the techniques, bought the book and now I refer to it often. I'm now training to run a marathon and haven't ever felt better. No stiff legs and hips. My speed's increasing and I'm loving it. Get this book and use it. It'll make a positive difference in your workouts.
B001EO748M|1.0|I couldn't get through the first season of dvds.  It was appalling.  The history is inaccurate, the costumes are dreadful and frankly I'm not particularly interested in watching people have sex.    I will give credit to Jonathan Rhys Meyers for his overbearing attitude - but Henry was extremely intelligent, very religious and he was TALL for goodness sake.    Give me Keith Michell as Henry any day of the week.
B000PMG16U|2.0|The first film was an embarrassment...  I was shaking my head in wonder when that idiot kid was having trouble reading the cue cards.  How the heck could they have cast someone so bad??  And that Jar-Jar Binks thing that was begging to get shot in the head by a 20 gigawatt mini-gun blaster...  One of the top ten biggest disappointments in film history...    No. 2 was Ok.  The terrible acting was of course second only to the abysmal acting in the first one.  The only redeeming quality was the yoda light saber duel at the end.    No. 3 I actually enjoyed a little bit.  Was neat seeing Darth Vader in all his glory at the end.  While the acting again - they should have cast Obi-Wan as the lead - wasn't so hot, the cool story made up for it.    I would buy no. 3 in blue ray, but I don't think I could stomach watching the first two again, especially not the first one.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I read about this game in Wired Magazine.  It sounded too good to be true.  I purchased the game and played it this evening with my 8 and 12 year old sons.  They ranked it the best game they had ever played.  That is saying a whole lot from a couple of active boys who are used to computers, DS and DSI hand held games, chess and Battleship. We had a ball playing the game.  It was pure joy around the table!  Although the world of the game and its ways are unlike anything we have ever played we found it easy to learn, fast paced and satisfying. This really is a 5 star board game.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood is a fantastic series, it sucks you right in (pardon the pun)!! It's been years since I've found a series that can keep my interest for longer than a couple episodes and True Blood not only keeps me entertained but makes me count the days till the next episode is on. The characters are great and you gotta love that it's on hbo (meaning lots of sex, violence and naughty language). Buy this dvd, Season 2 is already available for pre-order and I'm planning on ordering it asap.
B00110K62U|5.0|I very much enjoyed the 10th Anniversary concert of Les Miserables. I have already seen it 4 times and plan on seeing it many more times! I believe that the quality of the DVD is excellent and so is the concert!  I certainly do recommend the purchase of this DVD to anyone who is a  Les Miserables fan like myself!
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I bought this gadget because I didn't want to pay the yearly fee that the GPS type rangefinders require, plus not all courses are on the GPS ers.    The Bushnell is top notch.  I am not too steady with aiming it at the pins, but it always finds the range very quickly, and is quite accurate.    No longer do I have to estimate the range when away from the markers on the fairways.     Great instrument.   I highly recommend it.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I saw a review earlier that mentioned the movie \\"Crash,\\" which was a terribly overrated film. \\"Crash\\" does not compare to the brilliance of Clint Eastwood's \\"Gran Torino.\\" This movie teaches a wonderful lesson and does so beautifully.    Being Eastwood's last starring role in a film, he did a magnificent job at creating a believable character.     I could go into more details about the film, but this is one that everyone should see for themselves. Words will not do it justice.
B0027G783W|5.0|Ive always kept an eye on Moby's releases. He has had, at least in my book, a few good releases. This CD is a one great CD. If you like the ambient \\"instrumental electronica\\" (think I just coined a term there) in works like \\"Living\\", \\"God Moving Over the Face of the Waters\\" or the vocals and lyrics in album \\"18\\" then this CD is perfect for you. If the CD \\"Play\\" was your favorite then I am not sure you'd find this CD all that thrilling.<br />There are a few ambient tracks in here. Mellow and soothing if not heart tugging and getting you to conduct an introspection. The first four tracks and the last one are an example. Tracks that have vocals are like the stories you feel from the songs in the Moby album \\"18\\": the simple songs with lyrics that can fit in a single paragraph but contain a vast amount of data and emotion. These vocalized tracks in \\"Wait for Me\\" are very similar. \\"Mistake\\" and \\"JLTF\\" (track 7 and 10) are great examples of this. Lyrics (like most lyrics, yes) tell a story but it is the sounds of the voice and the instrumentation that sets, for me, Moby's work apart from other artists. All the other tracks are simply great and can conjour emotions- if you let them.<br />Youre caught in rush-hour traffic? The ambient tracks will soothe you.<br />Just ended a relationship and reliving teen angst? Most, if not all the tracks with lyrics may pull your emotions and instigate thought.<br />To me, that is what Moby and his music is great for. The simple songs with short lyrics act like therapy; something to relate to, something to talk you down, or something to soothe you... the drinking buddy that doesnt require a drink. Sure, not everyone will agree; but if youre patient enough and only found a few excellent tracks in the 30sec demos im sure listening to the entire CD youll begin to understand.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Wonderful music played by real life artists.  Shares a feeling of hope for our world!
B00001IVR0|5.0|I absolutely love Brahms piano concerto No. 2. I own several versions. This one (Backhaus with Bohm and Bachauer on Mercury Living presence) are my favorites.    What makes one version appeal to one over another is a personal one. But, there is so much beauty, charm and grace in this version. It does not try to overwhelm you but yet it moves you. It is not overly blazen fast (like Richter's version with Leinsdorf) but lyrical (oh what a beautiful andante with cello in the 3rd movement!). The balance between piano and orchestra is superb (engineering is superb). The sound is glorious.     It truly deserves its legendary status.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|My daughter (5) and I loved this movie and we're eagerly awaiting the DVD release! My expectations for the movie were rather low and I ended up wishing I could go to see it several times! There wasn't much of the typical Disney \\"cheese\\" for this type of movie, in my opinion. It was tastefully scripted and the acting was good too. The music was super fun and the moral of the story was a good one revolving around putting family and friends first, making difficult decisions and dealing with the consequences. It's a good \\"part of the road to growing up\\" movie and one I look forward to watching again with my daugther (and again after she's in bed! LOL!!).
B001K3JF7K|4.0|I listen to this CD at night when I'm going to sleep; it's very relaxing. Great jazz sound.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie is excellent. You can view it as a cute story about people, mice, paris etc.  You can look deeper and see a story about immigrants in europe doing jobs other people won't do, or doing jobs better. Or you view the movie as a quick production but using excellent video animation.  I really like the part where the rat starts to run out of the kitchen and back peddles to fix the soup.  Very nice movie.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|It takes, two, three, maybe four complete listens to fully appreciate the superb compositional quality of this work. It's all here. Searing leads, pounding rhythms, blazing fast tempos, and more... The MORE is complex, well played, well arranged masses of keyboards as well as orchestral passages that elevate this work WAY BEYOND all previous Priest albums. I truly believe this is their finest work. All hail to a group who have managed to re-invent themselves and come out better than ever. Wonderful!
B001FB4W16|3.0|I've watched 4 episodes so far - this series is a great modern spin on the vampire myth.<br /><br />But the picture quality on the blu-ray leaves much to be desired.  It seems like every 3rd or 4th shot is really grainy with distortion, which becomes a real distraction that takes you out of scenes.  Has anyone else noticed this?
B0028T6XXY|4.0|This is a wonderful CD with many of my favorites - and the DVD is a well done \\"Concert/Documentary\\" for Michael lovers.  But to really fall in love with him - check out his studio produced CD's first.  His rich, full voice has more warmth than Sinatra, his phrasing a matter of preference.  Michael is such a road warrior, often touring for months at a time, a seasoned fan can hear him getting a bit \\"overly creative\\" with tunes he's sung over and over and over on the road.  The result is not necessarily the best rendition of the song as performed in MSG, but the excitement is palpable.  You just gotta love the guy - I know I do.
1416914307|5.0|Exciting conclusion to the series.  Definitely recommended reading for preteens and teens.  Does it turn out the way you thought?  You'll have to read and find out!
B001KZIRL8|4.0|Dating is, perhaps, the oldest game there is.  We all play it at some point, devoting countless hours and resources to it, only to fail a majority of the time.  We enlist the help of others--friends, books, websites, seminars, etc.--but even with such help we still end up utterly lost.  There doesn't seem to be a fixed set of rules, and when we think we've found a set, countless exceptions pop up and throw said \\"rules\\" out the window.  Aiding and abetting our frustrated attempts are well-meaning friends who encourage us through assurances of our likeability, our attractiveness, the other person's stupidity, etc.  So why do we continue to play this game?  We play in hopes of finding that ever-elusive thing called love.<br /><br />It is into this eternal fracas that the filmmakers of He's Just Not That Into You cast their audience.  This is the story of nine intertwining lives, each person's tale adding another layer to the complexity of relationships that we all encounter day to day.  This film boasts an all-star cast and, for the most part, does not disappoint.  It is charming, funny, dramatic, shocking, and incredibly honest.  A rare find in a \\"romantic comedy\\" genre so often riddled with puerile vapidity.<br /><br />Though a story of nine lives, the central story guiding the film is that of Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), a hopeless romantic who spends much of her time pining by a phone hoping her latest date will call.  As tends to happen in such circumstances, Gigi is patronized and coddled by her girlfriends who attempt to assuage her fears of being rejected and alone.  Then Gigi meets Alex (Justin Long), a straight-shooting bar manager who opens Gigi's eyes to the difference between what men tell her and what they really mean.  This includes the shocking reality that sometimes guys just aren't into the girls they go on dates with.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with this as everyone can't be \\"the One,\\" it's just a fact that needs to be accepted and dealt with.<br /><br />The rest of the film deals primarily with stereotypes:  the obsessive compulsive wife, the pompous jackass who finds it hard to believe that marriage means he can only sleep with one person for the rest of his life, the sultry libertine who lures him away, the guy who \\"doesn't believe in marriage,\\" the woman who's been with him for nearly a decade hoping he'll change his mind, and of course those who are looking for love in all the wrong places/faces/online profiles.  But even though these characters are stereotypes, they are believable and done very well.  All of us know people exactly like the ones portrayed on screen and so we are able to connect with, and probably even empathize, with what is transpiring before our eyes.<br /><br />All in all, this film is quite enjoyable and I appreciate the honest way in which relationships are portrayed by the filmmakers.  It's refreshing to see a \\"chick flick\\" which actually has some basis in reality and does not fit the typical \\"girl meets guy, they fall in love, fight and break up, get back together, and live happily ever after\\" formula that typifies the genre.  Inevitably, some will not like what they see on screen and will claim it's too harsh on certain types of people.  My only response to that would be:  the truth sometimes hurts.<br /><br />Video/Audio<br />The Blu-ray disc is presented in full 1080p in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is excellent and really brings out the vibrant colors used throughout the film.  The audio is Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and is very crisp.  This is mostly a talking movie, so it's hard to really evaluate the sound, but I had absolutely no complaints about the quality.<br /><br />Special Features<br />There are a number of special features included on the Blu-ray disc.  These include deleted scenes with commentary by the director, a featurette on translating the book into the film, and an interesting look into how film directors stage such seemingly extemporaneous scenes as phone calls.  The most interesting special feature for me personally are six mini-interviews with the characters of the film showing how their lives have changed since the conclusion of the film.  Very interesting way to continue the story and brings a further sense of realness to the lives of the characters.personally are six mini-interviews with the characters of the film showing how their lives have changed since the conclusion of the film.

B000003Z4C|5.0|This is a great album from beginning to end; every song on this album is strong. \\"Let Love In\\" is necessary to any Nick Cave fan's collection, and since it is an even sampling of his sound it is a great starter album for anyone who is unfamiliar with the body of Nick Cave's work and looking to explore it. The mood and melodies of \\"Let Love In\\" is an excellent marriage between the harder darker sounds of albums like \\"From Her to Eternity\\" & \\"Murder Ballads\\" and the poetic and melodic themes found in \\"Boatman's Call\\" or \\"As I Sat Sadly by Her Side.\\"
B001N26GFM|5.0|This story is unforgettable,remarkable,very inspiring and as one reviewer mentioned\\"powerful and moving beyond words.\\" The message is that  in spite of being surrounded by an evil regime,being taught hatred by an  assigned Nazi private tutor and exposed to cruelty observed in his new home,the goodness in the heart of this 8yr.old innocent and naive German boy reigns supreme. His name is Bruno.He developed a friendship with another boy about his own age. This is the boy in striped pajamas and is actually a Jewish kid imprisoned with his father in a nearby Nazi concentration camp, a place where innocent Bruno thinks is just a farm with strange workers inside. The ending is stunning as well as inspiring when the power of the human spirit with its goodness and kindness residing in an innocent immature child is contemplated. This movie is highly recommended.
B000X2H8G4|1.0|I bought this to watch TV at a volume that wouldn't disturb other people. Maybe I misread the ads but it does not work in this capacity. It amplifies whatever sound is in the room even breathing, but not the TV. I actually couldn't hear the TV unless I turned the sound up as high as usual. The headphones have a short cord and I couldn't move it closer to the TV to see if that actually helped and they are not comfortable. It has a lot of feedback at times too1 It was a complete waste of money. I live in a remote are of Alaska and it is too expensive to ship back so it is in the box in my closet. Advise people to read specs on another hearing amlifier.

I bought the 2 disk version for the extras.  Robert Ebert does a beautiful job in commentary and should do them more often.  Many of the extras are well worth watching.  As for the film, Bogart, Bergman and Henreid were never better.  Claude Rains is great also.  What a dream movie!

Unfortunately, she can't figure out what.  She receives a letter form a man living on Guernsey, a British Island off the northern coast of France.  Her name and address were on the flyleaf of a used book by Charles Lamb and is hoping she can help him find more books by the author.<br /><br />With this begins a correspondence between Juliet, her friends and the residents of Guernsey who, in part, survived the four-year occupation by the Nazis through their creation and meetings of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society.<br /><br />In nearly review of this book I've read, it was described as \\"wonderful.\\"  That is exactly what it is--an absolutely delightful, entertaining, occasionally heart-wrenching, wonderful book.  Told through letters, I laughed, and cried, and fell in love with each and every character, even Adelaide Addison because every community must have one person who feels they should be the arbitrator of everyone else's actions.<br /><br />I learned history I hadn't known which made me even more aware of just how easy my life has been.  I loved the inventiveness of the characters and their ability to survive.  I loved their sense of protectiveness and community.  There are subtle lessons to be learned here.<br /><br />I loved the love story.  I loved the reason why Dawsey wanted to read more books by Lamb:  \\"...Lamb visited his friend Leigh Hunt in prison... While there, Lamb helped Hunt paint the ceiling of his cell sky blue with white clouds...Lamb also taught Hunt's youngest daughter to say the Lord's Prayer backward.  You naturally want to learn everything you can about a man like that...\\"  Juliet, in one of her letters, talks about the Times asking her to \\"write an article addressing the practical, moral, and philosophical value of reading...so far my only thought is that reading keeps you from going gaga.\\"<br /><br />The only thing which kept this book from an Excellent rating by me was that, due to the original author's illness and subsequent death, the end portion was written by her niece.  While I applaud her completing her aunt's book and bringing this delightful book to us readers, the ending did seem abrupt and cause me to wonder what Ms. Shaffer's ending would have been.<br /><br />As Isola Prebby wrote to Juliet, \\"Reading good books ruins you for enjoying bad books.\\"  I constantly found myself wanting to read passages of this book aloud to others.

0783225733|4.0|This was a very well-done true story of a space mission that came extremely close to being a disaster, but the astronauts miraculously made it home safely. It's good storytelling and so interesting that it led me  to study the real Apollo 13 astronauts.    The movie is fairly long at 140 minutes and there is not much \\"action\\" but there is a lot of suspense and first-rating acting, both of which should keep anyone's interest. Knowing this was a true story makes one all the more involved with it.    For such a tense story, with these astronauts lives on the line, none of the astronauts or people at NASA or anyone's family members are ever seeing praying throughout this ordeal! You can bet, in real life, a lot of prayers were answered on this mission.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|I've seen this concert over and over again, sometimes with invited friends and it's truly entertaining. What makes it different are the numerous performances from different artists, singing and performing past and present numbers. I highly recommend owning this concert (in Blu-Ray preferably)for keeps.
0920668364|4.0|i had found this book because of it's reading by joey on friends and wanted to see for myself.  as some of the reviews say, it is pretty creepy.  partially due to the drawings.  i can see the underlying idea for the book, but beyond a certain age, i think it probably shouldn't be read anymore.  i gave it as a gift to my brother and sister-in-law, i hope they liked it!
B0029358GM|5.0|This is the album for Wilco fans who still think Being There and Summerteeth are their best efforts.  I truly disliked Ghost, and while Sky had a few good moments, I also found it a disappointment.<br /><br />Tweedy is back to just writing good songs.  Simple, to the point, and with his influences as bright as those suits they wore on the Tonight Show.<br /><br />Solitaire is one of the best things he's written in years (at least since Yankee).  In it he beautifully evokes the spirit of Nick Drake's Pink Moon, while still making it pure Wilco bliss.<br /><br />I can't say that there's a weak tune on the cd.  Wilco (the song) just makes me smile, as does the duet with Feist.  One Wing and You Never Know showcase Tweedy's amazing lyrics.  Every listen brings out some layer that you missed the first time around.  Musically, well, it's Wilco.  Is there a better band on the planet?  No.<br /><br />In a year which has brought us very little good new music (or at a time when rock has taken a dive into the gutless wimpy toilets of Grizzly Bear and Vampire Weekend), this album is a godsend.<br /><br />Right now it gets my vote for album of the year, pushing Ida Maria's debut to the second spot on that list.<br /><br />It rocks, it rolls, it's got heart.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Awesome Album by the \\"Black Sabbath/R.J. Dio incarnation. I found the music heavy, thrilling and chilling. The first time I listened to it, it gave me chills. This is great \\"Scary Music.\\" Also, this Album is unique when compared to: Heaven and Hell, Mob Rules and Dehuminizer. It's much scarier, heavier, and louder, and I think they intended it to be that way. The music is clean, melodic, heavy, dark, pounding, and an excellent complement to the darker lyrics (but don't take any of it seriously, just enjoy it like a good horror movie). I saw them on the \\"Metal Masters\\" tour and RJD was definitely the best live singer of all the bands at the show. I have tickets for their tour supporting this new album. I hope these guys stay together and make more great albums and keep touring because they are awesome and fill a hole desperately needed in metal right now. I gladly give this CD 5 stars.

B00004WIDQ|4.0|This movie is so dear to me.  Its one of those films where every couple of years you just feel like seeing.  For all who don't know jurassic park is about really rich man that funds a science team that finds out how to make dinosaurs.  He plans to open a theme park, the worlds most successful one, so he gets two archaeologists to ok the park for him or teach the other people about dinosaurs what they eat, what the can't eat etc.  But then every thing goes wrong (the good part).  The dinosaurs go lose and on a killing spree....oh yea. If you want to hear more then i guess i just sold a movie.
044693786X|5.0|My very inexpensive paperback was received in excellent condition.  I have never had a bad experience in ordering from Amazon.com and I appreciate their excellent service and the outstanding products offered.
B00005N9CV|4.0|I picked up this CD at a used book sale and it was the first Diana Krall CD I've listened to. I really really liked it, but had thought she was more of a jazz artist than a pop singer.  This disc seemed to be more pop than jazz. In reading the reviews a others seem to agree.<br /><br />This is a good disc, but I sense it is not her best work! I'm looking forward to picking up some of her other CD's and experiencing her voice at its best!
B0011UCOGG|5.0|I read this book so much faster than I did Eldest. There is enough plot for me, and even though he does use filler, this is still an extrememly great read. Warning, though. This book was in no way written for the squemish. There is no shortage of dismemberment, etc. But this book hit the spot for me.
B00005QGAV|5.0|I found this album to be a mix of classic Michael Jackson brilliance, and unfortunate influence of other artistis.  Roughly half the album was a work of brilliant Michael Jackson genius, and the other half.....eh.....not so much.  Overall though, a MUST for any Michael Jackson fan.    In The Closet  Remember The Time  Black or White  Who Is It  Give In To Me  Will You Be There  Dangerous    ALL works of pure art. From the intensely sensual lyrics of In The Closet to the wicked drum beat of Who Is It, these songs are classic MJ brilliance.  You can feel the pain, the anguish, and the love in MJ's raspy, tantalizing, sharp edged vocals throughout every song.  The hiccups have never been sexier and the videos of these songs!  Wow, the videos.  The videos add a depth that you can feel throughout the songs.  Look them up on YouTube, watch them each a few times, and it will enrich your listening experience when you purchase this album.    The rest of the album?  Forgettable filler.    The lyrics throughout this album are rich and full:    WHO IS IT:    \\"And it doesn't seem to matter  And it doesn't seem right  Cause the will has brought  No fortunte  Still I cry alone at night  Don't you judge of my composure  Cause I'm lying to myself  And the reason why she left me  Did she find in someone else?    Who is it?\\"    But in my opinion, the brightest gem of the album is \\"Give In To Me.\\"  The lyrics are haunting and painful...revealing and touching.  The piece has a very distinct \\"rock\\" feel to it with steel guitars, a tight beat, and coarse edge.  This song seems to open us up a bit deeper into MJ's world and emotions.  This will always be a favotite.    Now for the album cover.  WOW.  What a masterpiece.  The art is cleverly designed, showing a \\"window\\" into Michael's Jackson's chest.  Inside that window, you can see desolation, darkness, and a sort of eerie dead void. The cover seems to be designed in such a way as to portray the glamour, jewels, and wealth on the outside,but a sort of pain and cold emptiness on the inside.  A haunting picture.    All in all, well worth the money!  You won't be sorry.  Every CD player has a \\"Skip\\" button, which makes it very easy to celebrate the masterpieces of the album and blissfully ignore the unpleasantly mundane.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this game for my 16 year old son who read that it was better than Monopoly (which he loves).  Well, we have been playing nothing else at home and he constantly bugs his friends to play with him as well.  But beware, it has started some rivalries and we continue to play just to get revenge.  It's kind of addicting like those silly computer games!

0471267554|5.0|Finally, getting back to reality when it comes to eating the way our bodies are wired for.  Tired of \\"diets\\" and tired of the hustle and bustle of everyday life - eating foods that can cause our bodies to actually work against us with different problems and diseases.  The concept is simple, doable and reminds you over and over that this will take time.  Not a \\"Get thin or healthy quick plan\\" BUT a LIFE PLAN on how to heal your body and eat for longer life and better health.....and a better body!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Jack Reacher is one of my favorite fictional characters, along with Mitch Rapp, Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. I keep wondering who will play him in the films. In Gone Tomorrow he is back in top form: a hero who won't let go as he is sucked into yet another crisis. This time it's when he mistakenly id's a woman, Susan Mark, as a suicide bomber on a NY subway. As he works to unravel the mystery of why this woman really killed herself, as usual he won't let go when the authorities tell him to stay out of it. But this time Reacher is taking on a more global enterprise, and the hero in him refuses to let sleeping dogs lie (literally) when the pieces start to come together. The suspense builds, and it's an interesting twist as it's one of the few Reacher books told in first person. Much better than his last novel. I highly recommend it and look forward to the next installment in the Reacher series. This was not my favorite Lee Child book (that honor goes to one of his earlier efforts), but he's certainly back in top form and it's up there with the best of them.<br /><br />On a side note, I also bought this on the Kindle and am rating the book, not the price. If you wait a week or so, maybe a bit longer, the price usually drops to the 9.99. I'm giving this 5 stars instead of 4 to make up for the 1 star ratings people gave because of the pricing. I bought a Kindle book today that I could have waited a few weeks for until the price went down, but wanted it bad enough to pay the extra few bucks. Just some advice...wait if you want to pay the lower price.
0375826726|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It took a chapter or two to get into it, though.  Parts are fairly gruesome, too, and some passages have more superfluous, flowery, mind-numbing, plentiferous (you get my point) adjectives and adverbs than are remotely necessary, but Paolini definately has talent, even if he's no J.K. Rowling ;-)    Overall, a satisfying reading experience.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I do not have HBO, I heard about this show from a friend of mine. After hearing about how great it was I had to watch it for myself so when it came out on DVD I bought it the day it was released. I have not been disapointed. This is a great show and I look forward to next season.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|After a mildly entertaining third season, Supernatural came roaring back with its best season yet.  The show has also evolved in a number of ways.  It is now more serialized.  It is no longer only about two brothers driving around the country in Impala, with classic rock blasting, and fighting monster of the week.  Episodes are more interconnected as the overall story revolves tightly around the coming battle between angels and demons.      The story also turns much darker as the two brothers struggle with inner demons: Sam's addiction to demon blood and power, and Dean's guilt over what he was driven to do in Hell.  The two young actors have stepped up and met the demands of the roles, though the new actress for Ruby seems bland and out of place acting at opposite side of them.    The battle of angels and demons is no ordinary black and white affair.  We learn that God is forever silent, and that some angels are shady and would not hesitate a second to sacrifice human lives for a \\"greater\\" cause.   Lucifer was formerly an angel.  \\"Fallen\\" angels may or may not be \\"evil\\" in Supernatural's universe.  I marvel at how successfully the creator and writers of the show explore the Christian themes and myths.  There are countless references to the Bible and Milton's Paradise Lost, and echoes of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials.   In so doing, the season goes beyond popular entertainment to the realm of serious fantasy.      I recommend anyone new to the series to watch the first three seasons, and then stay in sequence for season four.  For long term fans of the show, watch the season again.  It is that good!
B00005JLD4|3.0|\\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" is a bit of a conundrum.  Upon watching this film, I was immediately taken aback with the steady use of widescreen cinematography, which graciously captured the beauty of Australia, despite the racist backgrounds.  I was pleasantly surprised by the ending, without giving too much away; I was unaware of the non-fiction elements surrounding these events.  \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" equally provided an unknown chapter of Australia's history, while also being an emotional challenge from start to finish.  With such powerful, and compelling, arguments for this film, why was there a conundrum?  With such strong, documentary-like features, one could expect this to be a brilliant cinematic entry, yet what was troublesome, was that \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" was only about average amongst films of this nature.  From a historical standpoint, it provided a new chapter unbeknownst to me concerning the racism, or eradication of the Aborigines race from society, but the ultimate pitfall of this film is the lack of depth in a \\"PG\\" rating.  Not that tortured children need to run the gamut of every historical film, but there was nothing (sans perhaps one scene) that demonstrated to me that these refugees were struggling in any way.  From the moment of escape until the emotional ending, not one time did I feel that these children were in danger; every scene possible was of them receiving help from either other Aborigines or from native Australians.  When these three girls made their presence known on screen, we were at a happy moment - nowhere within the 900 miles did we see famine, fatigue, or even pain.  One could argue that the collapse in the desert is one of them, but it doesn't arrive until the end of the feature.  Up until that point, we are left to assume that this is a simplistic walk and that any cuts found upon their legs were cautiously placed on from a make-up department head on the edge of the framed shot.<br /><br />I do not want to seem unsympathetic to the plight that these young girls took, it was not only a message to the Aborigines people, but also deflated the power of the Chief Protector (played by Kenneth Branagh - oddly, miscast in this feature).  This film was a struggle, it was emotionally draining to watch these girls desire nothing more than to just go home - but where \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" fails is the lacking realism.  The reality that these girls made this trek is real, the struggles and hardships of what was happening in Australia during this time is real, the help seen from within - both from locals and other Aborigines - was very real, but the physical journey seemed too \\"glossed\\" to truly find yourself lost within these events.  When the girls are walking, their hair remains in place, they never change weight, and there seems to be no horrifying event happen to them (i.e. bones broken, animal attacks, or even Mother Nature).  It seemed perfect, and that is what irked me about this film, the images of hope overweighed the images of struggle.  Director Noyce did not give us a balance, thus never quite reaching that true emotional punch at the end.<br /><br />Secondly, the concept of the \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" was surprising, I had no notion that this even existed, and after watching this film I wanted to know more.  This was another pitfall to this film.  Noyce should have given us, either in words or images, a bit of a history of the fence, and what it represented.  The symbolism throughout the film became apparent, but knowing more about this fence would have only strengthened the cause.  Finally, did anyone else wish that we could spend more time with the reconstruction camps and not with Branagh?  Again, not knowing enough about these camps, I wished to see what the religion was doing to these children.  I feel like we didn't get enough of this to fully see the horrors that were happening.  We heard Branagh's speech about \\"why\\" these were created, but it would have been interesting to hear it from the women of the robe's mouths.  There needed to be more of an emotional strain when these children ran away, I wanted to see that they desired to escape the teachings, not just go visit their boyfriends.<br /><br />With that said, everything else that Noyce did worked perfectly.  The score by Peter Gabriel was fantastic, adding to the sounds of the Aborigines.  The cinematography was perfect.  The widescreen shots, seen on a projector screen, were breathtaking as we traveled along the outback.  \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" was a decent film.  It was a great history lesson, and compelled me to learn more about a country I hardly think about in my day-to-day life.  My biggest issue with this film was the lack of \\"realism\\" surrounding the girls' journey.  I wanted more emotion, more hardship, more struggle - the lack of such made me feel like I, a average guy could make this journey.<br /><br />Grade: ** ½ out of *****be's mouths.

B00288KNLS|5.0|Coraline is a feast for the eyes.  The fact that is was shot in 3D is an added treat.  I was mesmerized by the artwork which took many years to complete.  If you are a true fan of the art of stop motion animation, you will LOVE this film.<br /><br />For those who say the story, etc. is no good ... [...] rated this film 88 percent fresh which is an excellent recommendation.<br /><br />The only warnings I would give:  The film is too scary for most small children.  And if you did not like the style of Nightmare Before Christmas, you probably will not enjoy Coraline.<br /><br />For the those of us who loved Nightmare Before Christmas, Coraline is a wonderful experience that should win many animation awards in the year to come!
B00164EAC8|5.0|What's with all the bad reviews?  I would have seen it in its theatrical run if not for all the tepid reviews by the \\"professionals\\".  Saw it first on VHS, then DVD (which I bought).  The fakes in the Japanese movies, well, let's just say, not my cup of tea.  Roland Emmerich does nice work and this one is real fun, complete with a dynamite sound track!  Oh well, to each his own, I have pre-ordered by BD copy, and look forward to more fun!

B000AGTPUK|4.0|My 4 yr old son loved recreating the train scene where it skids across the ice.  He asked us to make an icy river that can connect to his wood Thomas the train set, so his train could slide around on it.  We took a piece of plywood and cut semi circles out of the edges of it, so it could lock into his track pieces.  Never even needed to spray paint it blue... he loved it and thought it was just like the movie.  There are parts of the movie that are a bit scary (the marionettes in one of the rail cars and the man on the top of the train with the coffee mug) that we could do without, but overall, it's a great movie.
0312383436|2.0|Many girls dreams are to grow up and marry Prince Charming.  But a spur-of-the-moment rash decision ten years ago comes back to haunt Milly Havill.  While she is days away from marrying the man she thinks she loves, someone from her past coincidentally arrives, reminding her that she got married a decade ago, and never got divorced.<br /><br />While Milly's problem takes front and center stage, there are other issues with other family members.  Her older sister, Isobel, discovers she is pregnant, and the father does not want to be a father; her mother has become obsessed with Milly's wedding, and in the process has alienated her husband and just about everyone else; Milly's fianc&eacute;e has issues with his father and a perpetual sense of failure.<br /><br />Although Milly is quite a likeable character, the storyline is a bit unbelievable.  No matter what, I think that every girl who is engaged would have dealt with prior marriage issues beforehand.  Also, not to give away the ending of the story, but the relationship between Milly, Simon, Isobel, and Harry is a tad overboard.  I got the feeling that Wickham was trying to put in too many issues to make the story more complex than it needs to be.  Also, for so many issues at hand, the character development is lacking.  For example, little is known about Harry, and yet he ends up being a somewhat significant character.<br /><br />All in all, I much prefer the Shopaholic series and Can You Keep a Secret to this book.
B001V9LRTM|4.0|This set brought back way too many memories. And I had actually never seen the movie! I enjoyed the look and the quality of the picture and, especially, the sound. It is pretty long but the entire presentation and packaging were worth the price of admission.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|The Bruce Man still has an impact on the music world today and this Magic release is just that.  Many great songs from start to finish but I am kind of partial to Girls In Their Summer Clothes.  Its just such a well written song with great flow, cool vocals and great keyboard accompanyment.  A hit in any era in my book.    The other tracks are very good too.  Its tough choosing a second best but maybe I'd pick I'd Work For Your Love or Radio Nowhere with those crunching guitars.  Man Bruce still rocks.  The acoustic stuff is nice too.  An all out winner in my book.

B001RTP48Q|4.0|Following the politically charged [[ASIN:B000FMGTUI Fundamental]] finds the Pet Shop Boys pulling in the reigns a bit to mine more familiar territory. This is danceable synth-pop that is the Boys' stock in trade since the 80's, but with the maturity of men who have seen trends and styles come and go, yet weathered the changes. \\"More Than a Dream\\" could have been lifted from the likes of [[ASIN:B000002UWL Behavior]] until you hear that refrain that says \\"I believe that we can change, we can make it more than a dream.\\" So while the politics of the last album were right up front, they haven't disappeared completely.<br /><br />They are also feeling expansive about love these days. \\"King of Rome\\" is about the loneliness of need, and the opening \\"Love Etc\\" harkens back to the gold standard of [[ASIN:B001O304US Very]]. A smile may pop up as Tchaikovsky peeks through on You'll be able to dance to \\"Did You See Me Coming\\" and \\"Pandemonium.\\" And then you can marvel at the symphonic quirkiness within \\"Legacy.\\" \\"Yes\\" is a good Pet Shop Boys disc, once more proving that Neil Tennent and Chris Lowe still can make us smile and dance...and think about what we're listening to.
0385340990|4.0|This book is a quick, easy read for the summer. Written in a little different format then any I had read before, but easy reading. I enjoyed the story. My book club selected it for the month of July 09.
B001U0HBQ0|4.0|There are some movies that I just love completely the second I'm walking out of the theater. Then there are movies I just hate. And there are also movies that I have slightly mixed feelings about when the credits start to roll, and that's what Benjamin Button is for me. It's been 3 days since I've seen it, and like Children of Men or History of Violence before it, it's only grew fonder with time.<br /><br />As I was sitting in the theater, I was mesmorized by what I've been watching...and quite sure this would be my absolute favorite movie of the year. Then around the midway point the film kind of lost me for a little. I didn't like the choices some characters were making...but looking back on it now, I think it probably serves the overall movie better. But while watching the movie the first time, I was a little annoyed. That's why I think the movie will play a lot better on future viewings.<br /><br />Yet, I've only seen it once, so that's how I have to review it. It really is a beautiful movie, and the themes are some I can really connect with; \\"Nothing Lasts\\" and \\"how one little insignificant choice can alter things in ways you'd never imagine\\" and \\"regret\\". The movie really is the Anti-Forest Gump if you think about it. Both movie's are about one man's incredible life.....but while Gump might leave you feeling great, Button might leave you feeling like your dog just died (without resorting to manipulative crap like Marley and Me!). The movie didn't really have that one \\"CRY HERE\\" moment...but I was honestly fighting back manly tears for a good long while on this one (nothing fell mind you!).<br />Cate and Brad are fantastic in this one, and the FX are pretty much as flawless as they come (definitely the best of the year).<br /><br />I've intentionally left this review as vague as possible, because I don't want to spoil it for you. I'm not sure if this movie is for everyone. The crowd sounded pretty mixed as I was walking out of the theater, and i know my wife did not like it. It's almost 3 hours long, and while I didn't feel it, my wife was ready for it to be over after the first hour...also, she doesn't like Cate for whatever odd reason (I LOVE Cate and thought she was amazing in it).<br /><br />So anyway, for me, it's one of the best movies of the year. It's not my current favorite, but I think this is the kind that will get better each time I see it. With that said, I give the movie a solid A-/A. Highly recommended, but probably not for everyone.
B0006J28KU|3.0|This is probably one of the finest crime films ever. There is a certain coolness & style in this film that only Michael Mann knows how to pull off. Heat is a movie that will reward multiple viewings, there is no way that you will keep track of all the details in one viewing. The three star rating is a reflection of the DVD quality, the visuals are not clean & the audio is far to muffled & soft, I found myself using the subtitles. I watch my films on a very decent home theater, so you can trust my opinion regarding DVD quality.
0307454541|2.0|I made it through fifty pages of very clunky back-story about bad corporations and financial journalism. Since all the good reviews promised that I would be hooked by page one, and since I was instead deathly bored, I out the book down and left it.  Now that I've read some of the spoiler reviews I'm glad I did, as I am not ready to slog through another 150 pages of bad writing to get to a mystery that, apparently, has nothing to do with the first half of the book.
B001EN71DG|5.0|This is exactly the product I wanted.  It's well packaged and includes copies of both the original, and \\"special edition\\" episodes.  A lot of the other reviewers are (understandably) upset about the release of yet another box set.  But if you're like me and didn't have any copies of these movies to begin with, then this is a good choice.
B001KP2Y3K|2.0|I bought this CD and another one by the same artist based on one song I heard.  Unfortunately, the song I liked was the best one and both albums sound exactly the same.  There is no variety and after three songs I have to turn it off.
B0028K31CE|5.0|I ran to the store to pick up this cd on the day it was released and have probably listened to it 20 times in now two days. No, BLACKsummers night isn't the Urban Hang Suite, but it is a fantastic cd. I love almost every song (Playingpossum isn't my favorite and I tend to skip forward when it comes on). Absolutely love Badhabit, that's my favorite. Helpsomebody stays in my head, only Maxwell can do an uplifting song that's not sappy or gospelly. I don't care that it's only 37 minutes, or that it took 8 years to do it. I wish many other artists would take a few years off before they put out another typical cd. It's the quality, not quantity of the music that matters to me and on this Maxwell delivers. So happy he's back. Now looking forward to Sade's new cd.
B001E1DJD4|3.0|Chicago based pop chanteuse Rachael Yamagata should be one of the emerging queens of Alt. Rock by now.  Actively recording since the mid 90's, Yamagata is now finally receiving her due after appearing on a multitude of other artists (Ray LaMontagne, Jason Mraz, Ryan Adams, Conor Oberst and Rhett Miller) records.  On `Elephants...Teeth Sinking Into Heart,' Rachael Yamagata's sound is split into two separate discs.    The first disc is mostly comprised of wounded and somber meditations of love and loss.  Largely acoustic and quiet, `Elephants...' focuses on Yamagata's strength in her husky voice on many lushly arranged songs.  The mood on the first disc is contemplative and somber until it reaches a crescendo on \\"Little Life.\\"  Ray LaMontagne guests on \\"Duet\\" and provides a quiet intimacy to this track.    The second disc, `Teeth Sinking Into Heart' reveals a cynical side to Yamagata.  \\"Sidedish Friend\\" recalls PJ Harvey at her most prickly. \\"Faster\\" swaggers to a distorted blues riff.  \\"Don't\\" closes the album with a sigh and a warning showing that this kitten does indeed have claws.

B001DDCVCI|5.0|Celebrating the 40th anniversary of Johnny Cash's iconic recording at Folsom Prison, Sony Legacy has presented the entire concert from start to finish similar to the San Quentin box set.  This package has it all including a documentary that focused on Cash on that momentous day.  Is this extended edition necessary for your collection?  Sony Legacy reissued the complete `At Folsom Prison' nine years ago, or so we thought.  The purpose of this review is to examine what the extras bring to the table in terms of merit and what they add to an already outstanding live recording.    The answer to the above question is a resounding yes; this collection is indeed very necessary.  This edition of `At Folsom Prison' contains both concerts that were recorded that day in 1968.  I was unaware that there was a concert at 9:40 am and 12:40 pm, and that the original `At Folsom Prison' recording was a compilation of the two recordings.  The producer, Bob Johnson weeded out what he perceived to be the weaker material or lesser performances and had to edit out some of the stage banter because of album length constraints.    In the first concert, Johnny Cash seemed to be on fire and was hitting all the right notes, and the majority of performances from the original album come from this recording.  In the afternoon, Cash appeared to be struggling to recapture the dynamic from the earlier performance.  He fumbles lyrics at times and hits sour notes on \\"Orange Blossom Special\\" during the second concert but he remains dedicated to his cause.  Highlights from the second concert are \\"Long-Legged Guitar Pickin' Man\\" with June Carter, \\"Busted\\" and \\"Greystone Chapel.\\"    The remastering on this edition has made the performances sharper.  Everything sounds clearer, from the reverb drenched guitars to the crispness of the bass.  Notes seem punchier, vibrant, and more direct.  The unreleased material also showcases the performances of Carl Perkins and The Statler Brothers.  Both Carl Perkins' performances are lively and excellent.  His renditions of \\"Blue Suede Shoes,\\" \\"The Old Spinning Wheel\\" and \\"Matchbox\\" have been lying dormant for far too long.  These recordings sound vital as if they were recorded yesterday.    It's also nice to see The Statler Brothers acknowledged for their role in this momentous recording.  The Statler Brothers contribute \\"This Ole House,\\" \\"Flowers On The Wall,\\" a stirring rendition of \\"How Great Thou Art\\" and the novelty tune, \\"You Can't Have Your Kate and Edith Too.\\" Interestingly included in this edition is the opening announcement from radio deejay Hugh Cherry.  Cherry introduces both Johnny Cash shows and tells the prisoners how to present themselves to Johnny Cash.  Cherry indicates how they should respond to Johnny Cash on stage, which might seem to take some of the magic away from the time that Johnny Cash does arrive on stage.  It does not appear that the prisoners needed much prodding though, as most of them are in awe of the man in black.    The DVD `Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison' is included in this box set as well.  The documentary features archival footage and photographs of the day that Cash played Folsom.  It includes interviews with members of Johnny Cash's family and recollections from former prisoners.    So how essential is this package?  Completely.
B000F8O35U|5.0|There are few movies especially Disney movies that I will admit to ever watching, but this movie is one of the few I'm not embarrassed to admit watching or having a deep love for.  This is one of the few animated Disney movies of the late 80's and early 90's that I feel were the best that Disney ever made(I'm not counting the early movies like Snow White or Peter Pan those are beyond time immortal) movies like Aladin, Beauty and The Beast, and The Lion King.  I won't really mention the other two Little mermaid movies as while I'm not saying there bad I just dislike when movie companies feel the need to franchise a movie so much to the point it starts to loose its entertainment quality.  I still remember when this majestic movie first came out and finally after so many years the Disney Corporation has finally given this great time honored film the quality dvd format to put it on.  So if you're like me and want something to renew the love you have of the what made the Disney movies great here's one of the great classic collections to get for home collection library...<br /><br />Update 09-22-2011<br /><br />I just want to warn parents that if your kids want the book version of the little mermaid get the Disney one, while Hans Christian Andersen's book was a memorable book it was far from the happy fairy tale ending we got with the Disney version and many kids will probably be disenchanted after reading or being read the Andersen's original version of this story...
1577314808|5.0|Excellent book.  It is one of the few books in my life that I have read twice.  It is a life changing book.  This is a book I will always keep and refer too.  Don't pass on this one.
B000H2NA30|5.0|Edith Beer was a remarkable lady; extremely bright, educated, kind, honest, and had an amazing amount of common sense.  Edith told her story only to be able to leave her daughter the legacy of her own survival during the holocaust; otherwise, Edith had no incentive to describe her experiences during World War II.      She portrayed her life in great detail in Vienna, forced labor camp, Germany during the Reich, and Germany during the Russian occupation after the war.  Besides her experiences, we know her thoughts as she explains what is happening to her and how she existed.  It is remarkable that she went through her experiences alone, with tremendous fear, without someone with whom to confide and take care of her.    In Vienna, Edith went to university to become a lawyer.  She was denied her last exam because she was Jewish. (The Aunshloss between Austria and Germany had taken place; Jewish people were denied their basic rights, put into ghettos, and were being deported to the east.) She was deported to a slave labor camp in Poland; made to work long hours with little food and still remained a lady with good conscience.    The title of this book, \\"The Nazi Officer's Wife\\" says a lot about Edith's strength of character. She had been allowed to leave Poland to visit her mother in Vienna.  Once there, she realized her mother had been deported to \\"the east\\" and her own life was in danger.  With the help of close friends and forged documents she smuggled herself into Germany and became an Aryan.  She met a Nazi officer who fell in love with her.  She was honest and told him she was Jewish...the man did not care, and he became her husband and portector.  However, there were always issues of the secret being found out which terrified her.    Edith had a daughter, helped her husband escape Siberia while working as an attorney for the Russians in East Germany, and helped her husband's aunt monetarily, who had always been good to her. Upon returning to the Russian bloc, Werner Vetter divorced his wife, and Edith managed an escape to London with her daughter.    Angela has the answers to her mother's World War II memories.  I feel at a disadvantage.  I was very tuned in to every one of Edith's experiences and thoughts.  I felt close to her and would have loved to have had a conversation with her.      I'm sure there will be critics out there who will question some of the motives and actions of Edith Beer.  However, unless someone has actually been in the holocaust, and had the very same experiences, who can judge someone else's actions?  I for one, was delighted to read that in London, Edith had the good fortume to meet and marry a Jewish man from Vienna.  They both deserved peace and a comfortable life together.
0062502182|2.0|\\"Follow your dreams\\".   There. . .  I just summarized the entire book.  I picked this one up because I was impressed by the numbers and all the hooplah surrounding it.  However, I dragged myself through this book- continually telling myself there would be a light at the end of this bland and uninteresting tunnel.  There wasn't.  The writing style was childish and confusing.  The characters were shallow and dull.  The entire message of the book can be found in any He-Man or Smurfs cartoon episode of the late '80's.  If you need some watered down inspiration and like reading about magical and supernatural nonsense that doesn't apply to real life, go for it.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|So much has been written about the new album, \\"Death Magnetic\\" by Metallica you would have thought it was the second coming.  Old school Metallica fans are chomping at the bit for an album to sound like \\"Master of Puppets,\\" (it doesn't).  While newer fans are hoping it is not as bad as \\"St. Anger,\\" the only Metallica album to earn universal raspberries.  This album has also been leaked all over the Internet in the past couple of days, some intentional and some others not.  So is this the album that most Metallica fans have waited patiently for?    I would have to offer a hesitant yes, as this is the most Metallica -like of their recent output.  Kirk Hammett's guitar playing is all over this album, which will make readers of Guitar World blush.  However the sound on this album is somewhat muted, I could barely hear a bass guitar being played on any of the songs, but that may be the quality of the leaked songs.  The drums are overpoweringly loud and almost drown out the guitar mix, as most evident in the track \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred.\\"  The vocals on the album appear stronger in some songs than they do in others, with \\"My Apocalypse\\" sounding the most like vintage Metallica.  Lyrically, the album is about death, from Metallica's point of view and has about the depth of a junior high school kid's notebook scribblings.    For old school fans of Metallica, the stench of the \\"Black Album\\" remains.  Quality varies on this album, and Metallica run the gamut of musical styles.  Depending on your point of view, most of these songs are over 7 minutes long, and given the quality, that can either be good or bad.  \\"That Was Just Your Life\\" kicks off the album in a promising direction.  Rick Rubin's presence is evident in this song as it sounds like it could have been one of his productions in the 1980's.   Next on the album is \\"The End Of The Line\\" which sounds remarkably like what I just heard before and doesn't vary enough to sustain any interest.    The second side kicks off with \\"Cyanide\\" and \\"Unforgiven III\\" and we're back into \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" territory.  \\"The Judas Kiss\\" almost makes a grab for fans of screamo-rock, (think Atreyu.)  The instrumental \\"Suicide & Redemption\\" cannot come soon enough, and it almost washes away the bad memories of what came before it.  The album closes with \\"My Apocalypse\\" and leaves me puzzled at what I have just heard.    This album is not the victory or return that Metallica is hoping for.  \\"Death Magnetic\\" is a hodge-podge of sound trying to encapsulate Metallica's history in an hour. This approach works well when you have excellent material to work from, and it shows flaws when the material isn't top notch.  If I were to grade this album, I'd give it a D+/C- for effort.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This is a Hollywood classic:  fun to watch and full of memorable performances and characters.  If you get a chance, read the original play to see how Hollywood prettied up some of the dialog.  The movie was a little risque and cynical for its time but the play was even sharper.  It still shows up in anthologies.<br /><br />Here's a partial list of all the wonderful movies made in 1939, a year that has never been matched by Hollywood, before or after.  I was living in Atlanta in 1989 and was lucky enough to see many of these films on the big screen when the Atlanta Arts Museum celebrated the films' 50th anniversary.<br /><br />Gone with the Wind<br />The Wizard of Oz<br />Mr. Smith Goes to Washington<br />Gunga Din<br />Babes in Arms<br />Dark Victory<br />Destry Rides Again<br />Drums along the Mohawk<br />Of Mice and Men<br />Stagecoach<br />Goodbye Mr. Chips<br />Wuthering Heights<br />The Roaring Twenties<br />The Women<br />Young Mr. Lincoln<br />The Hunchback of Notre Dame<br />Ninotchka

B001FB55H6|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for Watchmen, I was whiped into a tizzy and immediatly had to rush out and get the graphic novel, instantly hooking myself into the world of the Watchmen and become a hardcore fan. When it finally came out that March day, I saw it twice and each time was completley blown away. Becoming one of those rare movies to be faithfully adapted and still retail some of its hardcore punch, Watchmen is in my opinion one of the best films of the year, perhaps even one of the best comic book movies ever made.<br /><br />Set in an alternate universe from our own, superhereos are pretty common place until a law is passed banning them from doing any more super work. When one of these supers, The Comedian, is murdered, it sets into motion a series of events that will have the world hanging on the crises and forcing these retired heroes back into action.<br /><br />Once again, Zack Snyder employs a similiar method he used for 300, with the whole greenscreen effect and once again it works beautifully. Each scene just jumps right at you, you are submersed into this grainy underworld that occasionally pops with brillinatly flashes of color (most obviously the yellow) and the effects are pretty damn amazing. Visually, it achieves on all fronts.<br /><br />And I have to point out the choice of music was absolutly spot on. I cannot listen to Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are a-Changin\\" without imagining the opening credits, which by the one are one of the many highlights of the film.<br /><br />What seperates Watchmen from other superhero/comic movies is the amazing psychological depths of the characters, profiles that you rarely ever see in these type of films (the other obvious example being the Batman series). With the likes of the Comedian, a typically vile character who you want to feel no sympathy for or Nite Owl, who is very spineless and docile, these characters could have easily been one dimensional and stagnat, but there were so many other layers to them, not just these outside conceptions but deeper, more thoughtful ideas that show more to each of the characters. And this kind of thing is certaintly not lost in the transition from book to screen, with each one holding just as much of their psychological profile and character traits that give the movie so much more then just an action/comic forray.<br /><br />With that in mind, every actor is great in the film, with defintinly the one standing out being Jackie Earl Haley as the violent Rorscache. Already my favorite from the comic, Haley goes above and beyond bringing him to life, adding so much more to the character then was seen in the comic, which is really saying something. He to me has become the new Joker of the year.<br /><br />I was a bit shocked at the sort of lukewarm reception the film got, but then again it wasn't like I didn't expect it. Watchmen the comic is going to be universally great because of its impact but the film is definintly going to split people, its just another one of those love it or hate it films, with me falling on the love it side. But truly, this is one of the must see films this year and once you view it, then you can make up your mind on it. Hopefully, you'll be like me and find it one of the most rewarding and satisfying films this year.ions but deeper, more thoughtful ideas that show more to each of the characters.

B00151HZME|5.0|As a kid growing up in the 80's, I was never fond of the majority of Top 40 music of that era.  I found the sound to be too produced and the artists were hard to take as they pranced and preened on MTV. Bunch of fops, I thought.  It's ironic that the music that I rejected twenty years ago as a kid has influenced a multitude of artists that incorporate these styles into something that I now find palatable.  Who knows, maybe a little nostalgia and maturity isn't such a bad thing.    One artist, M83 (Anthony Gonzalez) has taken those sounds and the feelings of that era and has created an excellent album, `Saturdays=Youth' that could be best described as a soundtrack to a lost John Hughes film.  M83 has crafted an album full of whooshing synths and brittle production easily replicating the feel of an 80's production.  This album is no simple mimicry though, because it has some great songs that accompany the production.  The instrumental \\"Couleurs\\" could have been a huge dance hit accompanying a Beverly Hills Cop scene.  \\"Skin Of the Night\\" is evocative of \\"Cry Little Sister\\" from The Lost Boys.    Although this album is drenched in 80's synth pop, it also contains some of the most solid songs that M83 has written.  `Saturdays=Youth' is an album that rewards on multiple listens as it illuminates the past and wanders towards the future.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I adored this series from the first episode.  It is quirky, sexy, dark, deep, haunting.  If you have any interest in vampires, this is the ultimate.  It has the magic \\"Alan Ball\\" touch and pulls you right in to his world.  This is the best HBO has offered in a long time.  Prepare to be bitten,...
B00009P1O2|5.0|Undoubtly you have seen this video or snips of it on You Tube and on   VH1.  Having the official dvd is necessary but only if you want in my opinion the very best concert in you own living room.    Just had to own this recording after seeing it on other media.  But I must warn that Freddie Mercury can be addicting because of the magnitude and scope of his talent.    Finally this is an excellent buy and remember it is a 2dvd package.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD set! I was born in '86, unfortunately too late to be a part of Michael's rise to his King of Pop status, but I've loved his music from a young age. I remember listening to the local Oldies radio station growing up and dancing to the Jackson 5 songs. \\"Will You Be There\\" was the song of my childhood and will always hold a special place in my heart.<br /><br />I went and purchased this set for myself the evening I learned of his passing; I had yet to own any of his music and wanted to make sure I had some of this amazing artist's work in my CD collection. I was lucky enough to find the Limited Edition 3.0 version with an added third CD. There are a few songs that I still wish were on here: \\"Never Can Say Goodbye,\\" \\"I'll Be There,\\" \\"Childhood,\\" \\"Give In To Me\\" and \\"Scream.\\" But, even with those tracks missing I do not regret buying this compilation one bit. It still has many, many other hits from his unbelievable career. If you've been thinking of getting this, do it - especially if you can find the 3.0 version. The music on these CDs have brought back memories that I thought were long lost...to me, this is priceless! I highly recommend this to any fan of Michael's, new or old!<br /><br />Michael indescribably impacted the music industry and his millions of fans around the world. We lost a legend on June 25th, 2009, but his music will live forever. Like the saying goes - \\"legends never die.\\" Thank you for the music, Michael. May you Rest in Peace!
B001RQ0SJO|5.0|\\"Two Suns\\" is a divisive album that draws people into two camps.  One group of detractors immediately dismisses Natasha Khan's output as being \\"Enya-Lite,\\" or derogatorily throw about Kate Bush's name when discussing the new album.    Fans of Khan's previous outing, \\"Fur and Gold\\" proclaim Khan as an important new voice for Generation Y, a solid storyteller capable of crafting music with a touch of otherworldliness who can transport the listener to an album full of emotional riches that unravel upon further inspection.  Clearly there has to be some delineation between these two extreme points of view, and I find myself in a separate camp where both sides have valid arguments.    \\"Two Suns\\" is an album that lives up to the reputation of its principal, but for me does not cross over into highly exalted status.  \\"Two Suns\\" is a solid album full of high concepts that do not become obliterated or mishandled.  The musicianship is often times outstanding throughout especially on the propulsively tribal \\"Glass\\" and the polyrhythmic \\"Siren Song.\\"   On \\"Two Suns,\\" Khan adopts two personas, one is Khan's spiritual self and the other is Pearl, the self absorbed, destructive femme fatale and both inhabit the soundscapes that Khan has created.    Of the two battling personas, it seems evident that Pearl is the winner in the song craft department; she simply gets the stronger material such as \\"Pearl's Dream.\\"  The concept of duality is pretty heady for a pop album and was also covered  by Rachael Yamagata on her recent album, \\"Elephants...Teeth Sinking Into Heart.\\"    \\"Two Suns\\" is not as direct as \\"Fur and Gold\\" but does reward on a psychological level.  Where this album shines is when it does away with the studio trickery to showcase Khan's vocals such as on \\"Travellin' Woman\\" and the uber-theatrical duet with Scott Walker \\"The Big Sleep.\\"  It's obvious that Khan wanted this album to be the definitive statement for Bat For Lashes and as an attempt; it lands fairly close to thathigh watermark.

0141439513|5.0|One of my favorite classics. I never thought this book was slow, although some might disagree because of the older english. I personally found the language in this book to be beautiful. I love the character of Elizabeth Bennet. She was a feisty, strong-willed woman, who wanted to marry for true love, as opposed to convenience or wealth, which was not very common during the time that this book was written. I loved it!
B001LF4IA6|2.0|`Working On A Dream' finds Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band together again after the `Magic' album.  The production on this album was completed by Brendan O'Brien and is very similar to the `Magic' album.  On a handful of tracks Bruce's vocals were brought to the forefront however, some of the tracks sound like sonic sludge because everything blends together which is extremely evident in choruses.  The album mixing on several tracks is terrible, it sounds like different instruments were recorded at the same volume settings.  I can only imagine that this will not sit well with the Springsteen fans.  With that being said, the next question to examine is how does `Working On A Dream' fit into the Springsteen canon?    The album begins with \\"Outlaw Pete,\\" Springsteen's spaghetti western epic about an evil bandit born in the Appalachian Mountains.  Odd territory for a Springsteen album, but he manages to pull it off amiably.  The driving strings heighten the drama in the song as the story unfolds amongst the narrator's repeated requests for the infamous Outlaw to acknowledge him.  \\"My Lucky Day\\" is more of a typical Springsteen song but is mired by the lousy production.  The keys on this track seem to overpower the vocals and the rhythm guitars sound like they are being brushed instead of strummed.  It's a shame the song sounds like this, as there is no sound separation coming from any of the speakers.    I've previously written about the title track as workman like, as if Springsteen were sleepwalking through the performance.  The production on this track is decent which throws the album off because the album continually switches between murky production and clear. The altering production techniques make for an aggravating listen.  \\"Queen Of The Supermarket\\" and \\"What Love Can Do\\" are stronger tracks that recall Springsteen's earlier material.  By the time the album reaches the dirt floor blues of \\"Good Eye\\" the production becomes overbearing.  I understand thatthis song is supposed to sound murky, but the production is too dense making this reminiscent of a My Bloody Valentine track.    As the album closes, the party ends and Springsteen focuses on darker and more introspective songs.  The production also clears up, and \\"Life Itself\\" is a pitch-black track that seems to shine because of the better production.  The guitar work in this track is top notch, and if I could choose a follow up single to \\"Working On A Dream\\" this would be it.  \\"Kingdom of Days\\" is a solemn rocker that leads into the gospel sounds of \\"The Last Carnival.\\"  Bonus track, \\"The Wrestler\\" is a great track in its simplicity and spare accompaniment as it examines issues of loss and redemption.    \\"Working On A Dream\\" fits well into the Springsteen canon of solid albums that could have benefited from a more consistent production.  With production issues out of the way, these songs should translate well to a live audience when Bruce goes on the road.

B001DF68MA|4.0|I bought this item for my husband for Father's Day. When it arrived, I was skeptical that it would work. Our son is 18 months old and weighs 24 lbs. The WeeRide looked like a doll would fit in it and nothing more. But, we tried it out before we made a final decision and so far we're very happy with the results.     It was easy to install (the bike was standard mountain bike). My husband said it wasn't too awkward to ride with the seat. And, my son loved it. The smile on his face when we went for our first bike ride was worth it.     I highly recommend this product.
0151013837|5.0|This was a fantastic book with an incredible, unexpected twist at the end. It is very insightful and touches on a variety of themes including religion, philosophy, man vs. nature, science, human suffering etc. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a book that is packed with adventure, suspense, but at the same time makes you ponder life.
B001CVCB9O|4.0|Calexico returns with their strongest effort since \\"The Black Light.\\"  Joey Burns and John Convertino have recruited the same players from that album and the new record is a pleasure to hear.  Exploring musical genres on both sides of the border has always been one of Calexico's strengths.  On the album opener, \\"Victor Jara's Hands\\" mariachi horns accompany the tribute to the fallen Chilean activist.     Calexico also explores different elements of sound throughout the album.  \\"House of Valparaiso\\" features Iron & Wine's Sam Beam singing backup in a Tex-Mex ballad.  \\"Slowness\\" crosses the border to deliver a country duet.  Mystery plays a key part to several of these tracks including, \\"Bend To The Road\\". \\"El Gatillo\\" sounds like it could be an Ennio Morricone outtake from some forgotten western. Considering the album's length, there is much to admire here from hushed pop songs to lush instrumentals.  Bravo, Calexico!
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I won't say anything to ruin the plot (even though I don't know if other reviews have already done that) and I'll just say that the book was a blast to read. Not the best book I've ever read, of course, but I loved it. It was over much too quickly.

0143038095|4.0|This book has some really good lessons. Unlike most reviewers, I didn't find the mothers and daughters hard to keep track of. The story may come off as boring and meticulous sensationalism, but most parts of this book are incredibly honest and profound; you just have to pay attention and think about what Tan is trying to say. I seriously believe it's aimed at an immigrant audience; if I dare say, Asian females.
B0027G783W|4.0|Moby faced enormous levels of critical backlash and was left for dead after several disappointing releases (Last Night,18, Hotel) failed to deliver on the promise of 1999's \\"Play\\" album.  Then again, when one of your albums is a genre definer, how do you follow it up without the critical repercussions?  I'll tell ya how, release a new album with more than one Kanye West guest spot and you're guaranteed a smash record!  On \\"Wait For Me,\\" Moby has crafted two pop gems with this guru that are outta sight!    I kid, of course as Kanye West is thankfully nowhere in sight on what could be perceived as Moby's homecoming album.  \\"Wait For Me\\" is an album that signifies Moby's critical rebirth and marks a welcome return to the expansive and sweeping sound Moby has become famous for.  Gone are the famous guest stars and the overblown production, as Moby has opted to make a simple and warm album that focuses on the tunes.  In his press release Moby states, \\"I wanted to make a record that was beautiful and warm and open and inviting, and also a little more idiosyncratic and personal.\\"    While \\"Wait For Me\\" achieves those goals, it is also spartan and doesn't particularly follow any popular trends.  \\"Wait For Me\\" is an album that you can listen to part to whole but really benefits when it is listened to as a whole.  This is a record made for headphones as the austere production and sound separation demands it.  You could call this record, Music for Music's sake.  Moby mentions, \\"I wanted to make something that a 26 year-old woman, in her apartment, depressed can relate to.\\"    \\"Wait For Me\\" is a heavy record in terms of the amount of sheer emotion that Moby conveys in all of the songs.  From the opening wash of elegiac synths of \\"Division\\" and the R&B inflected \\"Pale Horses,\\" you could sit enraptured by the beauty of Moby's music.  \\"Shot In The Back of the Head\\" jars you back to reality with its somber processed backwards  riffing which is positively mood altering.  The sampledfield dialog, gentle cadence and soulful vocals of \\"Study War\\" is reminiscent of \\"Play\\" and makes me wish I had some liner notes so I could properly credit its authors.  \\"Mistake\\" sounds touched by the ghost of Ian Curtis, as the vocal is almost a dead ringer for him, or maybe it's Lou Reed...it's kind of hard to tell who the singer is at times.    As the second side of \\"Wait For Me\\" opens, \\"Scream Pilots\\" kicks off a tenuous vibe where the rest of the music that follows seems unsettled.  \\"Scream Pilots\\" is drowned in reverb and sounds almost alien when paired with the antique synthesizers and warm strings that envelope it.  The title track, \\"Wait For Me\\" offers a ghostly piano intro followed by the off-putting and possibly semi-confessional lyric, \\"I'm going to ask you to look away/I like my hands but it hurts to pray/the life I have isn't what I've seen/the skies aren't blue and the fields aren't green/pray for me/pray for me/wait for me.\\"  The torchy \\"Hope Is Gone\\" follows casting an indigo haze around the remaining album.  By the time the album closes, Moby shines some light onto the dark recesses of his psyche but then closes everything off with the stately \\"Isolate.\\"  Surely \\"Wait For Me\\" is a contender for album of the year.

0307341569|5.0|This book was incredible. Savage, so savage, it made me feel ill in places, NOT because of \\"graphic\\" or \\"violent\\" content (although there was that) but because of the crafty intensity of the author's awareness of the undeniable layers of witless, self-involved oblivion that make up our daily existence, especially as children. God, how I remember that (in retrospect dangerous) filthy fog of adolescence, where the adult world was so utterly opaque as to be nuisance noise, the lives of others scrawled in front of teenaged eyes like just so much unreadable gibberish, perceived as \\"in the way\\" of real life. This book will teach you about oblivion and awakenings and adolescence and the danger of living inwardly. Fantastic all around.
B001MW0IY8|4.0|Antony and the Johnsons is definitely an acquired taste.  Bandleader Antony Hegarty sings in a disarming tone that is accentuated by an inescapable trill on almost every lyric throughout his music.  For some that may serve as an adequate deterrent, it does take time to become accustomed to Antony's mannerisms and affectations before his message is evident.  The music that accompanies Antony's lyric could be called chamber pop as most songs resemble small suites that lure the listener with the melodies while Antony casts a lyrical spell.    On `The Crying Light,' Antony sings a song cycle that examines the issues of birth, dying and death.  Although this isn't music for the faint of heart, it does conjure a mood of beauty and absolute despair, often at times within the same song.  Opener \\"Her Eyes Are Underneath The Ground\\" muses on the concept of mortality while a stormy string section provides the accompaniment.  \\"Epilepsy Is Dancing\\" lightens the mood somewhat before the entrance of the solemn \\"One Dove\\" which offers some respite.    Retribution is another theme that runs through the work of Antony and the Johnsons.  The damaged souls that inhabit the tracks  \\"Another World\\" and \\"Daylight and the Sun\\" are convinced that one day they will find their salvation but it never seems to arrive.  Antony also plays with musical juxtapositions on `The Crying Light,' the spectral \\"Dust and Water\\" features vocal and slight ambient accompaniment and is buffered between the eclectic \\"Aeon\\" and the orchestral \\"Everglade.\\"  Although there is a change in the music, the mood of loneliness and desolation never seems to let up from this album.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This is a movie of redemption. Well...perhaps not in the way you think. This is supposedly Eastwood's last movie as far as acting, or so I've heard. He plays a retired auto worker who's bitter at the world a.k.a. Hollywood's latest attempt at portraying the Grumpy Old Man, but this time it's nothing to laugh at. Here you have a man who fought in Korea, and is prejudiced against all Asians. He for the most part doesn't have anything nice to say about anyone. This all changes one night when his prized possession a 1972 Gran Torino is almost stolen by a teenage Asian boy as a initiation to join a gang. Well it backfires, and the boy is almost killed by Walt(Eastwood's character). It's at this point that Walt's and the boy Tao's paths cross as Tao's family makes him go over to apologize to Walt, and offers Tao to help out Walt. Walt's heart is softened somewhat, and he becomes friendly with Tao's family, and breaks bread with them. He also protects them well the big sister as the gangs in Detroit where Walt lives take a shine to her....Not. Anyway Walt takes Tao under his wing(In his own way), and helps him to come out of his shell. Then the real test comes when Tao's sister is assaulted, and Walt takes matters into his own hands so to speak. Surprisingly he does it up as a way to pay back the Asians he murdered in war while in Korea. He goes out, and gets a fitted suit, makes amendments to his will, and does something his dead wife wanted him to do, and that was to make confession of all his sins. He confronts the teenage Asians with the assumption to kill them all, but imagine that he allows the gang to kill him. This is redemption in action which is how I guess some men try to make amends for not showing love to one another because of male pride, and so forth. Tao in fact gets the closest to an apology from Walt as Tao assumes that he's going along with Walt to confront the gang, and Walt tells Tao that he (Walt) has blood on his hands, and that he doesn't want thatfor Tao. Not to mention that to the surprise of his family...especially his eldest granddaughter that the Gran Torino goes to Tao. This was a decent outing for Eastwood, but not quite the classics of \\"Play Misty For Me\\", or \\"Heartbreak Ridge\\". This movie did speak to me however as the scene where Tao goes into the barber shop with Walt, and Walt starts spewing slurs left and right, and then Tao trying to emulate Walt does the same thing, but ends up insulting the guy. This is where we as men have to be careful because we as children want to be modeled after our fathers. I know that one time I heard my father slur a race, and when I said something similar I was told to:\\"Shut Up.\\" I still don't understand if he didn't want me to utter the slur then why did he do it in front of me? This is not a movie for those who are offended by racial slurs, and downright raunchy language. However, Eastwood should've recieved the Best Actor award for his portrayal of Walt.
B000W91RUG|4.0|The shows are great, but there are no commentaries and the bonus features are limited.  Well worth the money even if you're not a geek.
B001B0AY68|5.0|Sorry, I just can't get on board with anybody that thinks this is less than a masterpiece. It's expertly written, excellently directed, and features two of the best acting performances ever committed to screen.     I try hard not to be cynical or close-minded, but anybody who says this is a poor film (the Amazon official reviewer included), simply doesn't understand good film. You don't have to love it, it may not be your cup of tea. But it's a cinematic triumph and one of the greatest adaptations of any novel, period.

He gave us just enough, only to yearn for more...just like a man.  LOL..

1573300403|5.0|I had not followed much of MJ's music for a few years, but this DVD definitely left me in awe. I had to watch the MTV performance 3 times. Michael Jackson was truely the greatest entertainer of our time when it comes to his command of the stage, the feeling he put into his music, and his art of dance combined with that wonderful voice. We may never see an entertainer with all these gifts rolled into one for a long time, if ever again! I can understand why millions of people mourned his passing. He was truely a great artist. Buy this DVD and share in my excitment.

B00196XXPI|5.0|I nominate this little novel as not only the best novel (known to me, anyway) written by an 18 year old, but one of the best escapist summer \\"beach reads\\" of all time.  Francoise Sagan perfectly captures the luxe seaside lifestyle of the French bohemian rich while telling a pretty good story of first love and oedipal complications without being too cutesy or self-serious. The Otto Preminger film with Jean Seberg, David Niven, and Deborah Kerr is pretty great, too.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|This, for \\"Blind Faith\\" fans is more than a reunion, it's a miracle! For both EC, Blind Faith or Steve Winwood fans, get ready to get blown away.  Eric is in rare form performing the old post Cream songs as well as some blues and an 80's gem.  Steve is outstanding in voice and playing as well as ever.  They seem to be having a blast and that makes them play with a little extra zest.  I am an EC fan and this is some of his best playing on film.  This is a must, it has that hippyness feeling that brought me back to a time when everything was beautiful.  Man!
0743501799|5.0|good practical advise. a must read (or listen to).  The only thing I didn't like about this is that it is one long track.  (my car cd won't let me backspace but to a track). You can tell they just threw the cassette tape onto a cd (it tells you to turn to side 2).
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This DVD is by far the best produced full concert DVD I have seen so far and I have a vast collection of Classic Rock.  For an Eagles fan, this is your DVD.  It has almost every song from the Eagles you want to hear and the solo hits of Glen Frey, Don Henley and an outstanding Joe Walsh, in sober sillyness.  Steuert Smith makes you forget Don Felder real fast and the horns make the music the best the Eagles have ever played, the harmonies are outstanding and there's even a song from \\"Eden\\" on the very long DVD, a great value for anyone that loves rock, specially the Eagles!
0793563836|5.0|Using this book, we are very pleased with our child's progress.  Advantages include:  1)  It systematically teaches reading and position playing.  It is thorough, and progresses in an easy, logical manner.  Used properly the student will become a competent reader on the electric bass.  2) It associates note reading with tab later in the book.  3)  The CD tracks are a great learning tool. My son was marginally engaged until we used the first practice track.  Now he's hooked because he has a clear achievable goal to work toward for each lesson.  I can't emphasize enough how the CD has added to his motivation and his achievement. And the practice tracks are in various styles of music, (including blues and metal).  4)  It's not boring.  It has modern techniques, even looking at slap and pop in volume 2.  5)  Technique explanations are well written and illustrated.  Using this book my son has practiced every day.  I think working on accomplishing the CD practice tracks has been the biggest single factor in keeping him engaged.  I also think the very well thought out, logical approach is just great.
B00003CXXS|4.0|After the huge disappointment of the first [[ASIN:B00003CXAT Jurassic Park (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]] (JP1) sequel, [[ASIN:B00004U8JV The Lost World - Jurassic Park (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]] (JP2), we were pleasantly surprised by Jurassic Park III (JP3).<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: This time we have paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill reprising his role from JP1) trying to keep a poorly prepared group alive on beautiful but, predictably, dinosaur infested island. The actors have a great chemistry that works well on screen. There are some very good character based plot twists and even a few dinosaur twists as well.<br /><br />Like in JP1, there is a good amount of subtle humor added in the movie. This really helps to offset the tension created in the intense action sequences. The action and special effects are almost as good as in JP1 and are far better than JP2.<br /><br />The dinosaurs in JP3 are much more fleshed out this time, with more advanced \\"personalities\\" and frighteningly realistic interaction with the environment.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|My wife and I absolutely loved this show, It's a little racey at times, but has a good combination of drama and paranormal weirdness.  Great acting and interesting characters.
B000BCE918|4.0|This set includes all three Jurassic Park movies and is a real bargin at this price!<br /><br />Jurassic Park:<br />The original Jurassic Park (JP1) movie remains my favorite of the three in the series. Released in 1993, this was one of the first movies to heavily use CGI effects seamlessly in conjunction with live action. The overall effect is nothing short of unbelievable or, more to the point, totally believable dinosaurs interacting with humans.<br /><br />The movie's plot centers on a Paleontologist (well played by Sam Neill) who is hired to give his stamp of approval on a new \\"Theme\\" park ahead of its grand opening. There is also good casting and acting from Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum (a good fit as a \\"Chaos-tician\\"), Samuel L. Jackson (way underutilized), and Richard Attenborough (very likeable as the entrepreneur, John Hammond). Rounding out the main cast are two kids (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello as Hammond's grandchildren) and an annoying programmer (Wayne Knight, \\"Newman\\" from Seinfeld). The movie does require some suspension of disbelief and acceptance of pseudoscience but overall the plot is strong and the effects are believable.<br /><br />Once the action starts in this movie it really doesn't let up until the very end. This is one of the few movies that has the ability to keep you literally on the edge of your seat. I have \\"nervous\\" people in my family who can't watch the movie all of the way through because the tempo of the action is so intense. For that same reason it is one of my teenager's favorite movies.<br /><br />The Lost World: Jurassic Park:<br />The second Jurassic Park (JP2) movie, \\"The Lost World\\", was a huge let down from JP1. While sequels seldom live up to the original movie, this one miss the mark by a wide margin. About the only thing to recommend about the movie are the outstanding CGI effects, everything else was poorly conceived and executed.<br /><br />This movie centers around Dr. Malcolm (played heavy handed by Jeff Goldblum) as he tries to rescue his girlfriend (Julianne Moore) from more of Hammond's (brief appearance by Richard Attenborough) dinosaurs. There is also a brief appearance of Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello (Hammond's grandchildren from the first movie), but sadly they really play no part in this movie. What we get instead is Dr. Malcolm's young daughter (not a bad actress at all, but laughable casting) as a plot device to provide more incentive for the main characters to be heroic.<br /><br />While most moves require some suspension of disbelief, this movie has plot holes so large that you could fit a herd of Brachiosaurus through them. All of the characters are caricatures that are so incredibly flat and poorly fleshed out that they act in ways no human would behave in a real life or death situation. The list includes Malcolm's non-stop \\"I told you so\\", the experienced field researchers ignoring basic interaction protocols, the daughter's surprising development of Ninja like fighting skills, the evil hunter who only wants to destroy something beautiful, the greedy incompetent corporate executive, and, perhaps most annoying of all, the \\"Earth First'er\\" who would jeopardize human life to save an animal. It is bad enough that the movie is tedious, but sadly it is also preachy.<br /><br />Unfortunately this movie should be watched to get the full Jurassic Park experience, but don't take it too seriously.<br /><br />Jurassic Park III:<br />After the huge disappointment of JP2, we were pleasantly surprised by Jurassic Park III (JP3).<br /><br />This time we have paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill reprising his role from JP1) trying to keep a poorly prepared group alive on beautiful but, predictably, dinosaur infested island.

B0010HOZS0|2.0|The Invasion is remake of the 1950's sci fi film, \\"The Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\". Hollywood has already produced two remakes and one TV spin off. I guess folks really relish in the idea of invaders coming to Earth and snatching our bodies. This latest iteration was driven by a large budget and a couple of sexy stars.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman stars as psychiatrist, Carol Bennell, and besides looking like the fine Aussie vixen she is, there isn't much for her to do. The films other big star, Daniel Craig, is so criminally underused he might as well not even be in it. This leaves Kidman to carry the film and frankly she doesn't look like she really gives a crap.<br /><br />The first half of The Invasion is gripping and the story unfolds nicely, if not predictably. It starts going downhill during a dinner party scene where some Russian guy spits out some nonsense rhetoric. It's supposed to make you think, but I hate when a movie spells out the exact message it's trying to convey. Shortly after, the film resorts to redundant chase scenes of Kidman trying to protect her dopey son, Oliver. Once most of the populace has turned into aliens, there are some genuinely uneasy moments, but these are few and far between. The ending is really bland and it fails at the deep, psychological impact it was going for.<br /><br />Like most aliens, the little spores in The Invasion don't \\"come in peace\\" and are rather hell-bent on assimilating all of mankind into their cold and detached species. This is done by projectile vomiting on a person's face or ingesting something an alien has blown chunks into. Charming isn't it? Once a human being has ingested the host, they eventually go to sleep and wake up an emotionless alien. The transformation effects are mostly CG and they look abysmal. After someone falls asleep it looks like Ron Jeremy crept up to them and rubbed one out on their face. However, instead of looking real viscous and gooey...it appears flat, fake and clearly digitized. It's lame and it minimizes any real chance this film had at leaving a terrifying imprint on its audience.<br /><br />The Invasion is a squandered opportunity for a decent remake. It's clearly trying to exploit our disease fearing, xenophobic civilization but it ultimately falls flat. The excellent cast isn't given much to work with and let's be honest...there is much better sci-fi horror out there. I'm sure some will find it interesting, but most of you will be bored. Perhaps if we wait fifteen years Hollywood will attempt a better remake.<br /><br />Final Grade: Dzes any real chance this film had at leaving a terrifying imprint on its audience.

0439023483|5.0|Suzanne Collins' [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] is a young adult novel set in the future after the collapse of the world and its rebuilding by The Capitol. To maintain order, The Capitol hosts The Hunger Games each year in which 2 tributes--a boy and a girl--are chosen from each of the 12 districts to compete to the death. Once all other tributes have died in the arena, the winner is set for life in terms of food--in a world without much food--position, money, etc.<br /><br />The heroine of this novel, Katniss Everdeen steps up and takes the place of her sister. She and her fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark, are sent to The Capitol with their mentor and the last member from District 12 to win The Hunger Games, Haymitch. Once in The Capitol, Katniss and Peeta are groomed, presented, prepped, and molded to meet the television standards for The Hunger Games. The dynamic between these two tributes shifts throughout the novel, and in some case, like an undercurrent, it tips the plot on its ear.<br /><br />Collins does an excellent job developing these young teens and staying true to the normal responses teens could have in this surreal world she creates. Katniss is a brave, but lonely girl striving to be noble, while Peeta struggles to remain the sweet boy next door and stay alive amidst the brutality of The Hunger Games. Collins' characters are well-developed, and readers will enjoy the outrageous antics of the drunken Haymitch, the superficial Effie Trinket, and others.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is an amazing look at a post-apocalyptic world through the eyes of teenagers. Collins is a masterful young adult novelist, and readers will be quickly absorbed into the world she creates. Readers will grit their teeth, bite their nails, and shake their heads as Katniss and Peeta struggle to survive amidst determined, skilled tributes from the 11 other districts.<br /><br />Collins goes beyond the entertainment factor of most young adult novels to depict real-life situations in which young love buds and confuses, alliances are made, lies are told, and truth surfaces when characters least expect it. The Hunger Games is not only for teens, but also adults, though parents should be warned there is violence and innuendo.<br /><br />Thankfully, readers won't have to wait too long for the sequel, Catching Fire, which comes out in September 2009.nfuses, alliances are made, lies are told, and truth surfaces when characters least expect it.

031606792X|4.0|So some people are being way too harsh about breaking dawn. It was definitly not anywhere close to as good as twilight, tho i must say bella kicks butt as a vampire instead of her normal whiny and needy human self. breaking dawn is a different style than the previous three books which is rediculous. and stephanie meyer writes way too much about bellas wants and needs with edward. it seems like thats all she ever thinks about. the scene at the end with the volturi is completely lame, they shouldve just wiped them out then while they were ahead since edward said they will come back again eventually. Over all there were many disappointments in the book compared to the others, but it was still so wonderful. I would definitly recommend reading, just try to look past all the weird things. Oh and once again Jacob has no shame in being the biggest wimp ever! He is even worse in this book to a different degree.
B001GM28HO|4.0|Gwen Stefani decided to be a cheerleader and landed at #1 with \\"Hollaback Girl\\". Katy Perry \\"Kissed A Girl\\" and landed at #1.  Britney Spears' comeback single \\"Womanizer\\" placed here at the penthouse. Pop-tarts seem to come and go, but always score a couple of hit singles, with at least one of those landing at the penthouse.  For Lady Gaga, she's had two #1 singles and third single that has landed in the top 5 that should probably have ended up at #1. Who is this \\"lady\\" who one of my friends called an \\"alien\\", particularly after that bright pink, bubbly, nude Rolling Stone cover.  Who is the real Stefani Germanotta that goes by this Lady Gaga persona and why do people care so much? Well, people care because Gaga seeks to change the face of pop music, as all pop starlets hope to do and it's a feat that she has easily conquered.<br /><br />Gaga's first single, also the first track off of her platinum THE FAME \\"Just Dance\\" features a virtually unknown R&B singer (Colby O') and should be a doomed single. Past all the pundits, \\"Just Dance\\" lands at #1, and it turns out that it isn't even her very best single! Lady Gaga seems to one-up herself and makes for a competent, though not completely perfect debut album, THE FAME.  Following \\"Just Dance\\", third single (her steamiest yet) \\"Love Game\\" is undeniably catchy, despite its explicit undertones.  It's scary when middle school kids across the nation are singing, just as Gaga sings \\"let's have some fun/this beat is sick/I wanna take a ride on your disco stick\\".  What is even scarier is one liners like \\"Had my a** squeezed by sexy Cupid\\".  The ends is that Gaga writes one hit pop song and \\"Love Game\\" is certainly a hit and one of the most ingenious pop songs in sometime.<br /><br />\\"Paparazzi\\" isn't quite as catchy as the \\"cream of the crop\\" of THE FAME, but it is one of the better selections.  Solid as anything else, I could see this being yet another ornately shot, Lady Gaga video. This is more of pop at its most creative and finest.  The signature song of THE FAME is perhaps Gaga's most creative single of all, \\"Poker Face\\", a song misunderstood by the masses as far as content is concerned, yet still beloved.  I'm sure that the brilliantly constructed \\"Poker Face\\" will be played across clubs and \\"discos\\" (if they still exist) for years and years to come.  \\"Poker Face\\" is one of those classic dance songs that may very well stand the test of time, something that seems very rare these days is popular music.<br /><br />\\"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\\" has a hard act to follow after the brilliant poker face.  It stands up to the test, if a shade or two less alluring than the intimidating \\"Poker Face\\".  The production is brilliant, tropically flavored pop, perfect for any sunny day.  The follow-up track, \\"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich\\" brings back edge to Gaga with a hard drum groove and cutting-edge lyrics.  The production is solid and Gaga successfully engages the listener with this straight-edge pop ditty.  No, it isn't \\"Poker Face\\" either, but it comes closer than \\"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\\".<br /><br />\\"The Fame\\" is another solid selection, showing Gaga in good voice with nice pop production and grooves.  This would be another worthwhile track for a single - but then wouldn't anything appearing on THE FAME lay well as a single? (The answers yes!) \\"Money Honey\\" features more desirable production work and more great dance music from Lady Gaga. \\"Money Honey\\" isn't necessarily as distinct or as special as the singles from THE FAME, but again it is above average by all means. \\"Starstruck\\" featuring Space Cowboy and Flo Rida is easily a production standout, sounding as if it would be at home on Mars as opposed to Earth. It is in the league of the best of THE FAME in my eyes. It is yet another outstanding candidate for a single.  As always Gaga is on her game, and even Flo Rida's appearance is worthwhile (no disrespect intended). The production by Space Cowboy and Martin Kierszbaum is phenomenal.<br /><br />\\"Boys Boys Boys\\" is as solid as anything else, and the production work by RedOne is as great as his work on \\"Just Dance\\", \\"LoveGame\\", and \\"Poker Face\\". It is just as fun too, if a slight downgrade from the best.  \\"Paper Gangster\\" opens up with piano and then adds a distorted 808-sounding drum to the mix. Again very solid, particularly where production is concerned, it the best of the best of THE FAME.  \\"Brown Eyes\\" slows down things and does so convincingly. The chord progression utilized here is strong as is the production work.  Gaga also sounds very good here.<br /><br />\\"I Like It Rough\\" is average in comparison to the best material while \\"Summerboy\\" is a nice pop-rocker to end an overall strong debut.  \\"Summerboy\\" features one thumping bass line, always a plus in my eyes.<br /><br />In essence, Lady Gaga's debut is a strong affair.  It isn't perfect mind you, but it is easily one of the best dance-pop affairs we have seen for sometime that is actually captivating.  Lady Gaga gives other pop starlets like Katy Perry or Britney Spears a clear cut run for her money.as solid as anything else, and the production work by RedOne is as great as his work on \\"Just Dance\\", \\"LoveGame\\", and \\"Poker Face\\".

In essence, Lady Gaga's debut is a strong affair.  It isn't perfect mind you, but it is easily one of the best dance-pop affairs we have seen for sometime that is actually captivating.  Lady Gaga gives other pop starlets like Katy Perry or Britney Spears a clear cut run for her money.

B0028K3192|5.0|Maxwell has been out of the spotlight for a stunning EIGHT years, which is nearly an eternity in the music business, particularly in this day in age. A hardcore proponent of the neo-soul movement, many have questioned how Maxwell would update his signature, soulful sound when returning to a highly changed music scene where R&B has become nearly synonymous with hip-hop (and they are NOT the same thing). Maxwell came back, not the same, but even more soulful featuring a ten-piece band and perhaps the strongest album in his career. BLACKsummers'night, the first album of a trilogy, is nothing less than an R&B masterpiece. Not only does Maxwell sound as convincing, soulful, and sensual as he did during his \\"Ascension\\" or \\"Fortunate\\" days that helmed the neo-soul movement, he sounds even more affected vocally by soul music and pure unrequited soul.  \\"Pretty Wings\\" is the perfect single - just commercial enough to make somewhat of a stir at radio, despite is unapologetic, non-commercial grandness.  I would love to see BLACKsummers'night be that lone, soul-laden R&B album to debut at/near the penthouse of the charts and at least be certified gold.  Whether that will happen is beyond my personal control or jurisdiction, but I can state that from a critical standpoint, BLACKsummers'night is exceptional in every facet of the word.<br /><br />The album opens with the incredibly soulful, sensual \\"Bad Habits\\", which finds Maxwell singing in his pure, undeniably taut falsetto. In a time in R&B where the live-band is shunned and considered \\"old-fashioned\\", the set-up only bodes in Maxwell's favor, particularly making a soul track like \\"Bad Habits\\" stand-out among a host of over-produced \\"hip-hop R&B\\" tracks that have convoluted urban radio. The live horns truly add dimension and body to the totality of BLACKsummers'night. Intact with a \\"breakdown\\" section as well as an instrumental-driven outtro,  \\"Bad Habits\\" is one of the best and most true \\"R&B\\" tracks of 2009.<br /><br />\\"Cold\\" is equally or nearly as alluring, with a harder groove than \\"Bad Habits\\". Again, \\"Cold\\" benefits from a superb vocal performance by Maxwell as well as fine production work and exceptional songwriting.  Again, the use of soulful horns truly establishes a heightened sense of credibility within the scope of these 9 tracks from BLACKsummers'night.<br /><br />\\"Pretty  Wings\\" is by far the valedictory track from BLACKsummers'night, as hard as that is to say of an album that is just this consistent. The songwriting is perfect, vocally Maxwell has never sounded better, and the authentically soulful production make this track a lock for a Grammy nomination (I'm crossing my fingers). Of all the fine R&B tracks that have been released this year, \\"Pretty Wings\\" stands out as one of the most genuine.  It's even catchy! (\\"Your pretty wings, your pretty wings...\\"). \\"Pretty Wings\\" has a haunting quality, perhaps why it is so addictive and is defeating the odds of being a radio fixation.<br /><br />\\"Help Somebody\\" keeps the momentum going with its grand concept and with Maxwell's earnest, sincere vocals. It is also great to hear R&B singers resurrect the notion of writing about the socially conscious, something that veteran soul singers like Stevie Wonder and the late great Marvin Gaye did so often and achieved in such a distinguished manner. \\"Stop The World\\" finds lover-man Maxwell at his most sensual, giving one of his most sensitive, falsetto-laden performances of BLACKsummers'night.  \\"Love You\\" is as soulful as anything else, finding Maxwell painting his vocals over a sick, soulful drum groove and subtle blotches of swelling organ.  \\"Fistful of Tears\\" sounds indigenous of 1970s soul as opposed to the neo-soul of 2009.  Fantastic is the only word that can be used to describe the rousing \\"Fistful of Tears\\", in which you can truly feel Maxwell unrequited sincerity.<br /><br />\\"Playing Possum\\" and \\"Phoenix Rise\\" end the album strongly, despite not possessing the same greatness as \\"Bad Habits\\", \\"Pretty Wings\\", or \\"Fistful of Tears\\".  Either way, both this tracks are well written, well performed, and do nothing but rightfully heighten the profile of a soul star returning back to a scene the he once took by storm.  No one can deny that Maxwell sounds on top once again, eight years or not. I hope this is the album that can solidify Maxwell a Grammy.  If it's not, so be it, but he definitely deserves to be nominated as this is one of the very best R&B albums of 2009, EASILY. Brilliant.istful of Tears\\".

B00005QGAX|5.0|It is truly sad that at the event of someone's death that their fame grows to epic proportions, sometimes even more so than when they were at their peak. Jackson has always been a fixation throughout the world as a cultural icon, through and through the controversies that sought to undo \\"The King of Pop\\".  But even with his less critically praised efforts (INVINCIBLE), Jackson has always had the voice and the showmanship, that is untouchable by anyone else. He has paved the way for Usher, Justin Timberlake, Ne-Yo, Chris Brown and countless other performers today. BAD, is one phenomenal contribution to pop/R&B music, exploiting Michael Jackson's more rock/pop side. Instilled with hit after hit, one won't find one lax selection on BAD. Sure, THRILLER and sometimes OFF THE WALL are praised as Michael Jackson's signature works, but BAD can't be discounted giving its seven singles, its Grammy nomination for Album of the Year (1987) and its overall commercial success (even if less so than THRILLER).<br /><br />The album opens up brilliantly with \\"Bad\\", the title track, and a #1 single.  The production, though from 1987, still sounds cutting edge to this day. Something about Quincy Jones production skills on yet another Jackson album make for one of the most timeless tracks (\\"Bad\\") and most timeless albums of our time. My favorite line must definitely be \\"your butt is mine\\" with an energized MJ showing off his machismo through this signature track. Here on \\"Bad\\", you can hear Michael Jackson borrowing from the groove oriented nature that made James Brown, Michael's idol, such a revolutionary force in rhythm and blues, and the pop music of his time. Vocally, Michael sounds perfectly in tune and gets a grade \\"A\\".<br /><br />\\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" may have an inherit, signature 1980s sound, but as far as songwriting, vocal performance, and even the classicism of the production work is concerned, \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" is timeless.  It ranks in my mind as one of Michael Jackson's very best performances. I'd stack it against any pop or R&B song today and it would easily outdo most or all of them.<br /><br />\\"Speed Demon\\" is given less credit than most of the \\"hits\\" from BAD.  While it falls bridesmaid to many of the other tracks on BAD for me personally, it is still a killer track.  The production rocks with all the synthesized instruments and the electric guitar(s). The hook is incredibly catchy and as always MJ sounds like signature MJ. MJ sounds particularly charged when he facilitates his falsetto.<br /><br />\\"Liberian Girl\\", like \\"Speed Demon\\" is also underrated in comparison to the \\"hits\\" of BAD. However, it is as consistent as every other track that appears here.  \\"Liberian Girl\\" tends to be a smooth, mid-tempo track exploiting the utter beauty of MJ's voice.  Again, the production is typical of the 1980s, but a certain timelessness is apparent, much like the timelessness of the greatest pop albums of the 1980s (Prince's PURPLE RAIN, George Michael's FAITH, or MJ's own THRILLER).  Another sound, highly enjoyable track.<br /><br />\\"Just Good Friends\\" utilizes more cutting edge, electronic-based production work, providing for a cool-sounding, up-tempo number.  MJ truly commands the track as always with his unrequited, undeniable swagger and his pitch-perfect, energetic vocals.<br /><br />\\"Another Part of Me\\" features bombastic production work with the King of Pop evoking his signature \\"hee hee\\" in falsetto.  Few performers manage this \\"scream\\" and perhaps the only one still living is Prince (both James Brown and MJ are now gone).  Not my favorite track from BAD, but certainly worth the listen, as with anything else on BAD.<br /><br />\\"Man In The Mirror\\" is songwriting gold and there is simply no other way to put it.  Like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder before, this song is socially conscious, a theme that many of todays pop and R&B artists fail to incorporate within their albums. After the phenomenal \\"We Are The World\\", so many of Jackson's songs took on this socially conscious aspect.  Definitely one of my favorites from BAD and one of Jackson's very best. The choir just adds more depth and grandness to this fantastic song.<br /><br />\\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" is another brilliant Jackson song, also notably another Jackson #1.  As far as the #1s from BAD, I think it falls victim to being forgotten, though personally I think it is an absolutely lovely song that is very unforgettable. Maybe it doesn't possess the greatness of say \\"Billie Jean\\" or \\"Rock With You\\", but it certainly shows off Jackson on his \\"A\\" game.<br /><br />\\"Dirty Diana\\", yet another #1 shows of MJ getting his Mick Jagger on.  Michael Jackson goes all out rock star on this extremely well produced single that is undeniably catchy, filled with soaring electric guitars and all the machismo that goes with rock and roll. A great song, not my personal favorite Jackson hit, but definitely timeless.<br /><br />\\"Smooth Criminal\\" is definitely one of Jackson's best, BEST songs.  The production is slick, Jackson's frantic vocals are perfect, and honestly it's just plain COOL!<br /><br />\\"Leave Me Alone\\", like all other BAD tracks is well written and another clear-cut hit.  It definitely deserves its accolades and its place in history as a hit by the King of Pop. The production, Michael's vocals, and the songwriting are magnificent.<br /><br />The above mentioned tracks all appeared from the original release of BAD.  Included on the SPECIAL EDITION are a couple of worthwhile bonus tracks including the funky \\"Streetwalker\\", a spanish version of \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" (\\"Todo mi amor eres tu\\"), and the slick\\"Fly Away\\", an unreleased ballad.  Also, included are interviews regarding BAD.<br /><br />Overall, no one can deny this is a 5 star album.  Sure, it may play bridesmaid to THRILLER or OFF THE WALL, but it is every bit as notable and enjoyable. MJ doesn't miss a beat. 5 stars.ious aspect.

B001PPLIEG|3.0|I liked the film, although I don't like the person who plays Bond as well as previous actors, and I would prefer a man playing \\"M\\".
B00192IV0O|3.0|THE E.N.D. (ENERGY NEVER DIES) is no masterpiece - had to get that off my chest to begin with. With that said, it is more interesting to listen to, much because of the more experimental, liberal production work, than its predecessor, MONKEY BUSINESS.  I wouldn't necessarily say production wise it is necessarily better than ELEPHUNK, but it does bring new ideas - sound ideas that is - to the table. As far as being a politically, socially-conscious album as the Black Eyed Peas suggested this album might be, I don't really see it, but whatever I suppose.  After all, it is The Black Eyed Peas and I think the key to \\"The Peas\\" is fun, party- and pop-rap. Interestingly, The Peas explore more than just hip-hop or pop-rap on this album.  Second official single (or maybe third single) \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" is totally different from anything the Peas have released before. Though despite shining moments like this one, the Peas also back-step a bit, or they don't step forward enough. The biggest problem may be ultimately that at nearly 70 minutes, had the Peas cut down The E.N.D. to about 50 minutes, it may have laid better.  But they didn't and there are still enough highlights to speak notably of THE END (ENERGY NEVER DIES).<br /><br />\\"Boom Boom Pow\\" is by far their very best single in sometimes, as ultimately corny or stupid as it may be. It is no surprise that this single stayed at #1 for 11 Weeks. Lines like \\"I'm so 3008/you're so 2000 and late\\" make this silly club-banger worth the time.  Instantly, you also see a heightened explicit nature to the Black Eyed Peas as most of the profanities go without censor. Sure, every Black Eyed Peas album seems to escape the dastardly Parental Advisory label, but this one seems to feature even more rebelliousness. It doesn't bother me, though it may bother some parents - just saying.<br /><br />\\"Rock That Body\\" is certainly a production showcase, but also proves to be one of the most listenable, worthwhile tracks off of THE E.N.D. Fergie's voice is made to sound 'child-like- on this uptempo jam (a production technique, of course). The sample used here is an ingenious choice. My only qualm might be that it is a tad bit to \\"electro-centric\\". \\"Meet Me Halfway\\" is OK, though forgettable when penned against \\"Boom Boom Pow\\", \\"Rock That Body\\", or the following \\"Imma Be\\".  \\"Imma Be\\" features fantastic production work, and more profanities from the peas (\\"I'm gon' look fly and s***... etc). However, on \\"Imma Be\\", the Peas sound like they have more swagger than they have showcased before.  \\"Imma Be\\" drifts into an uptempo track, showcasing will.i.am's experimental sense of production.<br /><br />\\"I Gotta Feeling\\" one-ups \\"Imma Be\\", and certainly bodes as the Peas' most interesting, unique sounding single to date.  This single sounds more pop than anything else, giving the Peas a different sound and format to work with. Much like \\"Boom Boom Pow\\", it's no surprise \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" has quickly ascended to the penthouse of the Billboard Hot 100.  \\"Alive\\" and \\"Missing You\\" are both solid listens, though they lack the pizazz of say \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" or \\"I Gotta Feeling\\".  \\"Ring-A-Ling\\" is surprisingly good, despite being utterly corny, maybe even cornier than \\"Boom Boom Pow\\".  As far as production is concerned, \\"Ring-A-Ling\\" is among the best of THE E.N.D. - yay will.i.am.  No, it is isn't in the same league as \\"Boom Boom Pow\\", but not much is on THE E.N.D.<br /><br />Somewhere after \\"Ring-A-Ling\\" and arguably before, the album generally falls off, something that was prevalent on MONKEY BUSINESS as well. \\"Party All The Time\\" is average (though solid/presentable), while \\"Out of My Head\\" is a clean-cut miss in my eyes. \\"Electric City\\" resurrects some of the fun that presided the earlier portions of the ends, proving to stand out among the lesser consistent material that plagues the latter half of THE E.N.D.  Again, maybe its the explicit one-liners from the Peas that make certain tracks more likable.  The production on \\"Electric City\\" is exceptional.<br /><br />\\"Showdown\\" is OK, though nothing great or stunning by any means.  \\"Now Generation\\" finds the Peas attempting to be more \\"socially conscious\\", though it doesn't bode well in the favor of a party-rap band in my eyes. The exception might be \\"Where Is The Love?\\" which featured Justin Timberlake from ELEPHUNK.  Similarly on \\"One Tribe\\" the band continues in this socially-driven direction, with more success this time around than on \\"Now Generation\\".  Again, I wouldn't call this an epiphany by any means, but \\"it is what it is\\".  The album closes with the hyperelectric jam \\"Rockin To The Beat\\" which closes this slightly bloated, inconsistent album on a decent, though not necessarily a high note.<br /><br />THE E.N.D. is a bit of a lofty title for an album where there are times indeed where (\\"the energy does die\\") or feels lackadaisical a times.  Production always remains pretty strong, which bodes well in the Peas' favor. This album is by no means great, but it is a pretty enjoyable listen, even if to some extent you may feel \\"stupider\\" after you partake of it. 3 stars.nal.     \\"Showdown\\" is OK, though nothing great or stunning by any means.  \\"Now Generation\\" finds the Peas attempting to be more \\"socially conscious\\", though it doesn't bode well in the favor of a party-rap band in my eyes.

B0007OY2P8|1.0|I am a big fan of Jane Austin, but this movie is absolutely ridiculous.  The casting is bad, very difficult to believe that Henry Tilney is the \\"most agreeable man\\" when he's insulting and also played by a very unattractive actor.  Costume design made the movie laughably absurd as the characters looked and acted like they came out of Alice and Wonderland.  I agree with a previous review that said the ending is \\"rushed\\" and there are scenes mixed in that make you scratch your head in wondering \\"what was the director thinking?\\"--Especially the scene where Catherine is lead out of the castle by a young boy (rescuing her from the bad singing no doubt) to have her watch him do cartwheels in the garden as she stares dreamily at him.  Can't find enough adjectives to describe how bad this movie is!

B000N6U0DS|1.0|There are only a few movies that I find so detestible that I can't finish watching. This was one of those. I hated the message that anyone has a chance to succeed in this society if he works hard enough. That message is an afront to everyone who doesn't make it, who is poor and remains poor. In the first place, nobody should have to go through what the hero of Pursuit went through. What are we doing? Creating a system in which one exceptional person \\"makes it\\" while the rest are just sludge to be plowed back under? The irony of this is that the real person this \\"true story\\" is based on had affirmative action going for him. But that wouldn't fit the message of this film that anyone who tries hard enough can succeed. A more honest treatment of this guy's true story would show the role of government intervention in giving people a foot-up.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|Jagged Little Pill is great, but the songs here are so much more evolved than even the great JLP songs.  The layering of the music and the use of instruments and all frequencies is nothing short of brilliant.  It is everything that Jagged Little Pill was and more because the music here is even better!  Alanis, vocally, is doing the same super high quality vocals that we have beome used to from all her best prior work.  The lyrics are intelligent, unique, clever and fun in spots... classic Alanis.  Flavors of Entaglement is one of my most treasured CDs of thousands.  Alanis does not get enough credit for her greatness.  What more can I say about this album or the songs that hasn't already been well documented by others?  I am just here to tell you... this CD is a five star CD among all five star CDs.  It is great.<br /><br />Most importantly... BUY THE DELUXE VERSION.  I am not saying that to help Alanis or any business get more money from you, I say it because you will be cheating yourself if you get the regular version!  Many of my favorite songs among all the great songs on this album are on the bonus disc.

B002EULANU|5.0|Great to have Maxwell back and nice to see he hasn't lost his touch.     This CD is a bit of a mixed bag for me.  I like it a lot and think he returned with a very solid CD.  In my opinion there isn't a bad song on the entire CD.  Of course some are better than others but in the end none of them disappoint and I don't find myself skipping through tracks to find the \\"good songs\\".    That said it's a little different than his older stuff.  This CD is a little less soulful and seems to get away from the old Maxwell music in a few songs.  Now that's not all bad...like I said it's a great CD but it's not like the Embrya or Urban Hang Suite days.      I would say this one is on par with the \\"NOW\\" CD for the most part and well worth the $ you'll pay for it.      In the end Maxwell is still the best R&B/neosoul singer out there.  Can't wait for the next two CDs!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I love this album. If you are an old Radiohead fan that maybe was a bit disappointed about the direction the band was going for a few years... you will not be disppointed with \\"In Rainbows\\".     Above that, I think this album stands on it's own too as a good collection of songs that could be enjoyed by anyone who likes the genre. I give it my strong recommendation.
B000OURSO2|3.0|This is a well-written book that holds one's attention on most pages. However, it is a a classic case of yellow journalism - the description and explanation of Chris's death are totally fabricated by the author. There is not the slightest evidence that Chris was poisoned by any plant, period. I am an expert in this field and can tell you with certainty that the evidence tells us that the death described by Krakauer is simply impossible and wholly false. He should be ashamed for making this garbage up about someone's death.
1573300403|5.0|This DVD contains some of Michael Jackson's finest work.  I grew up with the Jackson 5.  They are woven into the tapestry of my life and I never knew how much until Michael died.

If you love Michael, you'll love this DVD. Trust me.

One can pick apart his character all you want, but this series conveys the birth of these United States in a most inspiring and revealing way.  No American citizen should leave this out of his or her concept of how this country was formed.  John Adams, warts and all is worth watching in its entirety.

0596007124|5.0|I've been writing object-oriented programs for the last 20 years, and have used many of the patterns listed in this book during that interval.  Some of these were picked up through exposure to frameworks that employed them, some from books, and some just re-invented because they made sense for my particular application.<br /><br />This book collects all of these patterns in one place, including some that I haven't used, and then explores and explains them from a variety of perspectives.<br /><br />The book is a collaboration between technical experts and experts in learning theory.  The result is that motivation for learning the material is thoroughly integrated into the formal content.  Rather than just describing the \\"what\\" of a pattern, the book starts by dialoguing with the reader about the \\"why,\\" so that by the time it gets into the \\"how\\" in more depth the reader is interested enough to explore all of the nuances of the various approaches to applying the technique.  It attempts to anticipate objections the reader might raise regarding the importance of a given pattern, while at the same time throwing light upon the pattern by showing how it addresses real needs.<br /><br />The presentation and examples are superior to most other books that I've read.  There's a fair amount of repetition, but from different perspectives, so that at least one of the facets presented should resonate with the needs and experiences of the reader.  In its presentation of the decorator pattern, for instance, the first example was a concocted coffee cost computation program that left me feeling that a critical aspect of that pattern, the building of more specialized functionality by wrapping more basic and fungible functionality, had not been adequately explored.  But they followed up immediately with a real-world example from the java.io package that not only explored that aspect of Decorator, but also referenced code that I had already personally encountered and understood.<br /><br />Another praiseworthy aspect of this book is the way in which it integrates general design principles like programming to an interface (rather than to an implementation) with more specific patterns like the Strategy pattern.  This gives the reader a lower level base to fall back upon if a specific pattern cannot be found, or if an existing pattern needs to be specialized for a particular purpose.<br /><br />This book arrived while I was designing a new application, and upon scanning through the various patterns for additional places within my application where patterns could be applied, I found a couple right away.<br /><br />All in all, this book represents a raising of the bar for content, presentation and pedagogy in a technical manual.of this book is the way in which it integrates general design principles like programming to an interface (rather than to an implementation) with more specific patterns like the Strategy pattern.

B001LF4ARC|2.0|The premise of this book is \\"part biography, part leadership guide\\". Well, I guess. While the book is generally tolerable, there are weaknesses. For one thing, Kahney needs to check his facts. One page 3 he mentions the launch of the iPhone in June 2006. Any sentient human being knows the phone was announced in January 2007 and first sold in June of that year.     Kahney also goes on to describe a competition among three ad agencies to craft an Apple ad shortly after Jobs' return to the company. Yet a number of interviews have mentioned that Jobs simply called Lee Clow at Chiat Day and gave him a week to write the Think Different ad. Although there certainly may have been a competition, I tend to believe Jobs just went back to his favorite copywriter.    On the back cover, there is the quote \\"I want to put a ding in the universe\\". I've always seen that quote as \\"I want to put a DENT in the universe.\\"    Such easy miscues undermine the credibility of the rest of the text. Meanwhile, the Lessons from Steve are interesting, although also quite general, particularly for anyone who has read interviews with Jobs.    Reading this book won't cause blindness. Perhaps boredom.
0385341008|3.0|The book is fun, but readers should be aware that The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society is purely FICTION, written by an American author.  For a taste of real coping experiences on the British home front during World War II, with large dollops of humor, read HENRIETTA'S WAR: NEWS FROM THE HOME FRONT 1939 - 1942 [[ASIN:B000OPLY42 Henrietta's war: News from the home front, 1939-1942]].  True, it takes place in Devon (away from German occupation), not Guernsey, but the author, Joyce Dennys, lived it.

B0029358GM|2.0|First let me say I am a HUGE Wilco fan...but the last few records have been a dissapointments to me as far as being consistantly good from start to finish.  I find myself skipping 2-3 songs at a time to find one that appeals to me.  Let me say again that I am a huge WILCO fan having seen them 8 time live...all which have been fantastic shows.    I think the problem of the last few records is that a lot of the songs have been in the same tempo...slow to medium with not much to get you to remember the tune.  My wish is that the next Wilco record rocks out with songs that you will be singing after your first listen.  Most of the songs lately are just there...hard to wrap my ears around and keep it inside my head.    Please guys try a record that rocks using those great guitar licks, horns, organ...we fans out here really need that record...I even have the title: \\"For Bob\\" ha ha..    One more time...I am a HUGE Wilco fan!!!!!
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|If you've read through many other reviews then you already know the story and know what the movie is about.  I loved this movie because it is really a romance a tragic romance and its also much more. Mostly it lingers in the mind about loving someone even when they are wrong or not wrong I don't know! I will say that the performances by the actors were superb espeacially the kid David Kross, I know why the boy was so believeable in the role because he was actually a kid not an adult playing a kid.    Even though  Hanna has the no nonesense about her most German women are famous for, she is isolated she has walls built up around her , in essence you can tell that Hanna has been hurt, that something happened to her to make her the way she is she so in to herself but I think its her way of protecting herself.As harsh as Hanna seems sometimes her ignorance also makes her seem somewhat innocent and certainly vulnerable. Hanna tells  Micheal once after a misunderstanding on the trolly cars when she thinks he was avoiding her that \\"he doesn't have the power to upset her\\", which obviously he does because she is very upset.       It took 2 viewings of this movie and reading the book to fully grasp this movie.  I had to really think about the characters from an emotional standpoint not just what was being shown or being told.  I honestly think Micheal was so heart broken when Hanna left him, so emotionally tied to her that the reason he would not help her when he had the chance and every opportunity to do so was because he wanted to punish her for leaving him, and leaving him emotionally unfulfilled. With Hanna in prison he would always know where she was. I think because he couldn't shake Hanna or stop wanting her , desiring her and longing for her I also think that he was so mad at her, that when she did go to prison and she learned how to read and write he didn't write back to her for two reasons, because he didn't trust himself and again he wanted her to feel the pain that he had felt when she left him.  Micheal couldn't face her because he loved her and didn't know what to do about that. He didn't trust her enough or himself enough to be near her, I think the chance that she might abandon him again was just to much for him he couldn't take the chance of losing her again. I think once he found Hanna again at the trial he was going to have her one way or another. In essence his guilt and his inaction and his not dealing with Hanna, tied him to her emotionally for life. Micheal could have possibly had a life with Hanna and been happy, at least he would have gotten what he wanted. He could never let her go he compared every woman to her and no woman for him would ever do or be complete because they weren't Hanna; but instead he made her his prisoner as he was her prisoner. This is a tragic love story on many levels, its about the choices two people make and the effects of those choices. I wish that Micheal could have faced Hanna and his love for her, not just for Hanna's sake but for his too.
0385341008|5.0|As an admitted book addict, I will read just about anything I can get my hands on.  This particular book started out a little blandly, perhaps even a bit trite.  Plot: writer of \\"fluff\\" looking for her next project in post-WWII England.  Ho hum.  Beach read...I thought.  Ah, but I was so wrong.  The story unfolds beautifully, the character development is extraordinary, and the prose exquisite in its' simplicity.  I'll read this one again for the sheer pleasure of it.
B001HBX91S|5.0|Not going to get into much detail but simply put....this BR is amazing! I got this for the family as where we live there's not much chance for us to get to see such cultural events. My kids are young and I figured this would open their imagination and curiosity. The picture is SOOOOOOOOOOO clear and the sound is superb that they were immediately sucked in. No it doesn't have the action and explosions that other BR movies have but it's on a class of it's own for PQ and SQ. I highly recommend, specially at this price!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|We went and saw this show in Vegas and it's amazing! The cd is so good from start to finish it and everytime I listen to it, it reminds me seeing it live!!!
0967851408|5.0|Came on time. Very informative open minded book for everyone regardless of whether you are religious, scientific or spiritual by nature. Applicable for anyone.
B0028SVXR6|5.0|There simply aren't enough words to describe this new MV album! Cedric's delicate and haunting vocals are just superb and mesmerising, and its nice to see the boys slowing things down for a change. This is an 180-degree turn from Bedlam in Goliath (their weakest so far in my opinion, although the Australian tour edition DVD video tracks are quite decent in small doses since the humour of the clips softens the aural onslaught somewhat), however the more subdued bonus audio tracks included on the DVD are definitely more on par with Octahedron. While completely different, I rate it right up there with both De-loused and Frances for outright brilliance (Frances is probably first, followed by De-loused and then Octahedron, but not by much).     Soulful, sublime and sensitive - three words that I wouldn't have thought possible in the context of MV music, but believe me, they pull it off with understated elegance and consummate ease!    The creative output by these guys (Omar's solo work alone numbers about 14 albums since 2004!) recently has been quite phenomenal, and you have to hand it to them for the sheer variety and level of experimentation that is evident in their collective body of work to date. It may not be for everyone, but once hooked (like me) its like manna from heaven.    Frankly, I liken this amazing and innovative group to Pink Floyd of the sixties and seventies (best band of all time), and I think its a privilege to be able to witness MV's evolution first hand (I'd give anything to go back in time and see the Floyd in their heyday!).    I can't wait to see what these guys put out next, but one things for sure; it will be completely different yet again (Omar's already set to release yet another solo album in the next few months).    Overall a balanced, mature, evocative and typically adventurous album (the best musicians develop and evolve over time as all intelligent beings should).    Interestingly, the song title 'Cotopaxi' was also the name of the freighter that was stranded in the Mongolian desert in the 1977 sci-fi classic 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (which could just be coincidental, although it seems rather unlikely given the penchant of MV for the science fiction genre).    (Five) star perfection from me all the way! Best Prog Rock band since Pink Floyd and Tool.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|This is probably the best Jane Eyre version I've seen. The version with William Hurt seemed dull and lifeless and the version with Timothy Dalton was way too melodramatic. This one seems to be the best quality, both with regards to acting and cinematography. Ruth Wilson is a perfect Jane and Toby Stephens plays an excellent Rochester, though perhaps a little too handsome to be exact. Stays faithful to the book, I believe, though it has been some years since I read it last. Excellent adaptation!
1416905014|5.0|I bought this book for my four year old granddaughter. She loves it. The pop ups are large with a lot of intricate and colorful, wonderful detail. Each time you look at it, you see something new. This is not an ordinary pop up book. I highly recommend this book. I enjoy looking at it and reading it with her.
B000W4KSWO|5.0|Coltrane and Ellington together make great music.  Some of the best clean, clear jazz I have ever heard.  This album came from the top 100 albums and I can see why.
0316024597|5.0|David Sedaris' new book is more of what makes his following so happy.  The chapters on quitting smoking were great--the extent to which he goes (I won't give it away)-- and how he takes all of us with him.<br /><br />I didn't want it to end....
078062999X|5.0|This is by far the best Hamlet ever made, by the finest actor ever to perform Hamlet. All of the other reviews have said it best. Even if you never see another Shakespeare play again, see this.  I was fortunate to see Branagh perform Hamlet in London in 1993. There are no superlatives great enough to describe his performance. He is the most under-appreciated actor of our time.   Buy this and savor it, and buy another one to save for your grandchildren.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I saw this album on CBS Sunday Morning and liked it. So I bought it and LOVE IT.  The music made by people around the world, most of whom have never met, is truly moving.  The Chandra Mama singer Tal Ben Ari, \\"Tula\\", is spectacular. She will be a star. Buy it. You'll love it!
0679745203|5.0|not my favorite book of all time but still good. if you have problems getting through the beginning stick with it because the end is pretty good.
0451197968|3.0|I had a plane ride across the United States so I read this as my form of enjoyment. I may have seen the movie before reading the book (I am a huge Stephen King fan and have read almost all of his books so I figured it was time to pick this one up) and the movie brings the realistic element that King is known for.   Overall, decent writing - which is why it got knocked down to 4 stars. The premise is good and execution is good but some of the time you feel like you are reading a novel and not engulfed in the game. I'd recommend it as a fun and easy read to anyone looking to waste time.
B001OW5NF0|5.0|The book is easy to read, easy to understand, and makes perfect sense.  It should definitely be included in any aspiring writer's library.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This is a must have for all Final Fantasy fanatics such as myself! The action is amazing, especially when Cloud faces off against Kadaj/Sephiroth and the music during that sequence is absolutely riveting! Would recommend this a million times over!
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I didn't even realize that when I ordered this there was a bonus DVD that came with it that has the music videos that made him all the more famous:<br />Billie Jean<br />Beat it<br />Thriller<br />Billie Jean: Motown 25<br /><br />NEW songs, 6 of them recorded in 2008 (re-recordings of originals already on the album). These re-recorded songs include the following artists:<br />will.i.am<br />Akon<br />Fergie<br />Kanye West<br /><br />There is also a track that was never on the first release that didn't make the first cut. It's the final track of this disk. In total there are 16 tracks.<br /><br />For everything this album has on it and the fact that it's a piece of great history now it's more than worth the 8-9 bucks you'll spend on it.<br /><br />Be smart and order a few things at once and get it shipped free from amazon as long as the still offer it.
0375826726|5.0|This is a great third book for the series. I can't wait until the next book comes out.
B001S86J0I|5.0|I already had a DVD copy of \\"Galaxy Quest.\\" I bought this 10-year anniversary deluxe edition for the extra features and I was not disappointed. It was enlightening to find out the origin of the idea, how the Thermian alien race was created and what funny/creative things happened behind the scenes. Plus, I needed to hear Sigourney Weaver rap. She's not half bad.

B0017ZB8M6|4.0|Katie Perry's \\"One of the Boys\\" album is a musical commentary on the young people today - their feelings and their daily encounters.  I think it's a great album (I'm over 60, so \\"album\\" is appropriate).  I remember having similar feelings as a teen.  I'm glad that today's society has evolved enough where songs can be written about those feelings and that they can make it to the \\"top 10.\\"   Katie Perry is a talented young woman.  Loved the CD.  Parents, don't be afraid to let your children buy this one & listen to it.  Great beat!
0316066524|5.0|It isn't often that you find a book that speaks so definitively for a time and a place as Infinite Jest and Wallace's voice and style are distinct from any other writer I've come across. It's by no means an easy book to get through (at times I had to force myself to keep going), and it's large enough that if you put it down you might find yourself lost the next time you pick it up, but the sprawling story you'll end up with if you stick with it is certainly worth the effort.    I highly recommend. He has a collection of essays titled, \\"Consider the Lobster\\" which is quite good, as well.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|Although different from the books, I enjoyed watching the series.  I only gave it three stars because there was way too much time spent on Tara's mother and Sookie's brother.
0807130087|4.0|It's a book, what does one say about a product like this. I wanted one and I now have it. But its a good book.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I am a bigtime Trekkie, for The Original Series, and The Next Generation, my dad got me into these, and he bought 38 episodes when Paramount released them on VHS back in the mid-to-late 1980's, we still have all those tapes, but even he said, \\"This is the way to view them\\", the special effects have been altered yes, but they look GREAT, not saying the original effects were crap, because they weren't,they were the best or their time, but the new effects really make these episodes even MORE enjoyable than they already were.    The episodes that faired the best from these new effects are,    Mirror,Mirror    The Doomsday Machine    Space Seed (Look at the shots of the USS Botney Bay in tow)    Assignment: Earth    The Galileo Seven    The Immunity Syndrome    Indeed, all of the episodes have significant changes, but those to me are the ones that really made me love these remastered ones.    As for the way to purchase them, you can either buy them as one whole set, or, buy each season seperatly, I would buy them seperatly as I did, reason being: it's cheaper...I dunno why the whole set is more expensive, ask Paramount I guess    Before I bought these I was weary of the new effects, but I gave them a chance, and I do not regret it!
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins is a strong thinker and he's written an excellent book. Rather than repeat what's been said in other reviews, I'll focus on one of the most controversial arguments he makes -- that indocrtrinating children is a form of child abuse, particularly the idea of eternal hellfire for not believing, not accepting Jesus as the savior, etc. As a former believer, I think its fair to say that it's relatively easy to stop believing that babies are born from virgins or that people magically rise from the dead. What's much more difficult is abandoning the belief in the vengeful supernatural god depicted in the Bible. The god who is going to banish you to Hell to burn for eternity. As Dawkins and others have pointed out, the hellfire meme is so powerful and so scary, especially to children, that it is very hard to break its hold. This is, of course, by \\"design\\" (in a Darwinian memetic sense).<br /><br />Speaking from my own personal experience and from talking to others who grew up with this, there's no doubt that this has a profoundly negative effect and is an inexcusable thing to do to an innocent child.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope
B0018YIFEK|4.0|I really did enjoy this book.  The ending to the trial and then the ending of the book (even moreso) were total shocks.  I was walking home from the train crying as I was reading.    Also read \\"Handle with Care\\" and again shocked by the ending.  That one was a complete cop out.  All that and then this is how it ends?  Seems to be a pattern that I now know to expect but I'll still read the books.
B0012GMVSU|5.0|This piece of work reflects every critical turn in the movie.  If you love the movie, you will love this one even more.
1400097029|1.0|Admirers of the novel or movie \\"Evening\\" will probably love this book. For all others: BUYER BEWARE. Mr.Banville has a deserved reputation as a crafter of fine prose, and this book does not negate  that reputation. What I object to is the mushy male chauvinism disguising itself as adoration of the Eternal Feminine. Unsanitary and unsavory. Yuck!
0061767581|5.0|L.A. Candy is a great read, you won't want to put down the book. L.A. Candy does remind me a little of the t.v. shows Lauren Conrad has been on, but to me the book was written in a different way, then how The Hills happened. A great read. This is one of my favorite books. The book is about four girls doing daily life while being filmed for a t.v. show. Most of the girls like it except Scarlett. It's amazing how Lauren Conrad wrote this book herself, when she is only 23 years old. It's amazing when you think someone who was on a reality show could actually write there own book by themselves. I think teens will enjoy this book the most. Worth your $20. This book would also be a great present for someone in there upper teens early 20's. You will enjoy the book if you like the t.v. show The Hills. A must read if your a Hills fans, can't go without.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|this is the most amazing movie i have ever seen on blu ray. i am a huge fan of the FF series and was totally in awe while watching this...absolutely fantastic!!!!
B001PPLIEG|2.0|XXXXX<br /><br />This film is a sequel to the 2006 film \\"Casino Royale.\\"  It is not based on a book by the late Ian Fleming.<br /><br />The title of this movie comes from a 1960 short story in Fleming's \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" but contains no elements of that short story.<br /><br />It is the 22ND \\"official\\" (meaning EON productions) Bond movie with Daniel Craig being the sixth actor to play British MI6 agent James Bond (code number: 007).  This is Craig's second outing as Bond, his first being Bond in \\"Casino Royale.\\"<br /><br />As with Casino Royale, the action and special effects in this movie are fantastic and very realistic.  This movie is also serious (which I like) and reminded me of the first five excellent, serious Sean Connery Bond movies and the excellent one with George Lazenby as Bond.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing in this movie suggests we are watching a Bond movie (except when the end credits roll the James Bond theme is played briefly).  It is just a well-crafted action movie.<br /><br />I did not care for the opening credit sequence and song.  There is no opening gun-barrel walk (but one appears, of all places, at the beginning of the closing credits).<br /><br />Daniel Craig appears to be quite fit for his role as James Bond.  But there is more to Bond than just being fit!  There is none of the Bond savoir-fare or the Bond witticisms that have come to define Bond--James Bond.<br /><br />The villain in this movie does not seem to be very villainous.  As well, the Bond girl seems to have weak acting ability.  Dame Judi Dench as \\"M\\" has an expanded role in this movie.  She gives a good, convincing performance.<br /><br />Personally, I don't understand why the Bond music is not more liberally used.  Nothing defines James Bond more than this distinctive music.<br /><br />It is also difficult to follow this movie (in terms of action and plot) at times.  I had to stop and rewind it several times.  (Viewers didn't have this luxury in theatres.)<br /><br />This movie was filmed in location in Italy, Mexico, Panama, Chile, Austria, and England.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2009) is perfect in picture and audio quality.  It has three disappointing extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, for those who are not James Bond fans, and looking to see a good action movie, this is the movie to see.  However, true Bond fans may ask themselves the following:<br /><br />\\"Is this a James Bond movie or is this an action movie that happens to have somebody in it named James Bond?\\"<br /><br />** 1/2<br /><br />(2008;  1 hr, 45 min;  wide screen;  28 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX>This movie was filmed in location in Italy, Mexico, Panama, Chile, Austria, and England.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2009) is perfect in picture and audio quality.

B000063UR1|4.0|Douglas Trumbull was given, along with a few other 'new talents,' a million dollars and no strings to make a movie in the early 1970s. This was an 'experiment' by the studios to see if an indie movie could produce big revenue. [[ASIN:B0002O7XWC Easy Rider (35th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)]] was what got this going. Trumbull had been the special effects supervisor on [[ASIN:B000Q66J1M 2001 - A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B000059POY Candy]], and [[ASIN:B00008438U The Andromeda Strain]].    Trumbull hired a decommissioned Air Craft Carrier from the Navy, a small group of actors, his father, and some friends and made this mini-classic. It is often called a 'cult' film, but it is much more than that. This was a 'message' movie that still resonates. Bruce Dern was given the opportunity to break out of his 'bad guy' persona here and really excels.     This is not the best SciFi movie ever made, but it is head and shoulders above the average. Interestingly enough despite the critical success of this film, Trumbull was rarely given an opportunity to direct again. He did do 'Brainstorm' in the early 1980s, but is mostly known for interactive 'rides' for which he has received little credit.
0545128285|5.0|People expecting another Potter \\"Septology\\" installment (a term I learned from \\"Does Harry Potter Tickle Sleeping Dragons?\\"...Nancy Solon Villaluz's brilliant new book) are just being unfair.  Rowling loves this little morality tale book she wrote and sold for charity, and I do too.  Besides, Rowling had Ron Weasley essentially complain that these were baby stories in Deathly Hallows, so what did the basher's expect?  Tolstoy?  Come on.    Rowling brings the ancient art of morality fables back to life.
B000UAE7RW|5.0|Amazon should review its policy of combining reviews. There are several here that say the DVD transfer is poor. That is in reference to other, older DVD Releases. If you are buying the Special Collector's Edition you'll find it just great!<br /><br />Roman Polanski did not want to return to Hollywood after the murder of Sharon Tate, but came back to do this at the request of Jack Nicholson. Robert Towne had passed on writing the screen play for Robert Redford's 'Great Gatsby' because he didn't want to kill his career by abusing a literary classic. He had written this screen play specifically for Jack Nicholson who was his friend and ex-roommate.<br /><br />Fortunately for Polanski the film was produced by Robert Evans who had the genius of letting great directors direct. Polanski notes in the documentaries that Evans more than anyone else made this film a great movie.<br /><br />Although it was nominated for multiple Academy Awards, Towne was the only winner for original screen play. Guess what movie won that year, 1974? 'The Godfather II,' kind of stiff competition.<br /><br />Polanski now says than after 'The Pianist' this is probably his best movie, even though at the time he was just anxious to get it over and get back to Europe.<br /><br />There are no mis-steps in this that I can see. There has been a lot of debate over the ending, but I can't imagine it any other way. A truly great movie.

0061231401|2.0|Heard this book reviewed on Fox, and was looking for some light summer reading. First Rollins book I've read - probaly will not read another. Predictable and more pyro antics; the usual stuff. If you are interested in Celtic studies there are hundreds of works on Celtic theology, mythology/history that are much more exciting and entertaining.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Sure, this album doesn't introduce anything new to the scene, but it's still a really good rock record. The songs are good from start to end.    To me, this album sounds like a mixture of Black Sabbath, The White Stripes, and Jet. His vocals are borderline annoying at times, but overall they fit the music well.    My Wife, not knowing who they were, initially thought Wolfmother were a band from the '70s. They have a very raw sound that isn't overproduced. I would recommend to anyone who likes '70s-style rock/metal.    ~Slick
0316017922|4.0|Without trying to come across as glib, Malcolm Gladwell's book which attempts to analyze all the various elements which make certain individuals successful, while others struggle; is terrific, simply because the subject matter at hand is so interesting.<br /><br />The research is decent, but not profound; however, attempting to unlock the mysteries behind \\"success\\" almost guarantees Gladwell, a very good writer, a best-selling book.  Look, ma; it happened!  I think this is the one billionth review on Amazon alone, and it's still selling like hotcakes.  A very worthy effort, and a very interesting story.  Who doesn't like to find out why a guy like Bill Gates became a billionaire, or why Bill down the street is still an unemployed slacker.  It's (mostly) inside the pages of this book.<br /><br />Ironically, Gladwell could add a seperate chapter, describing his astute thought process behind choosing this particular subject matter.  It was definitely a home run.  However, I still don't think there's any real correlation between having an August birthday & playing Major League baseball.  Of course, I never made it; born in July---the month for being a big-shot executive, who retired early.  Not bad; not bad at all.  I'll take it!
B0000029LG|5.0|Most people say Thriller is M.J.'s best album and while it is, more than likely (it's hard to say because all of his albums are so good) History may very well be his best album because it was his most personal album, it was angry, it was deep, and even thought provoking at times and well the music was still great as usual. This is a masterpiece and deserves to be up there with Off The Wall & Thrill as one of his best 3 albums. I'd say it's probably my #2 favorite of his. Off The Wall being #1 and Thriller being #3. Mike really did it up with this album. Love it. R.I.P. Michael Joseph Jackson.
0375842209|5.0|With every chapter my interest grew.  It is brilliant the way that the story is told and the perspective from which it is told from  ( I won't ruin it for you).  It may be a little slow at the beginning, but when you soon will not be able to put this book down.  So well written!  I finished the book missing the characters.  This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read.
B0028K3192|4.0|It seems the common observation is this album is 2 short, I agree.  Maxwell is playing games and releasing the rest of the BlackSummersNite tracks later so you have to wait years from now to hear the rest.  As a whole, this cd is good listening.  Maxwell has rythm and soul and usually elevates his voice to some other realm and dimention.  Some of the songs could have been tweaked with.  Maxwell will never be Prince, although at times it seems his music is influenced by Prince so it ends up being just Maxwell music.  Gone is the big hair and a somewhat new sound has arrived.  Some of it marvin gaye influenced, like Stop The World.  In order to make a full on assesment, I have to listen to the album more but so far I like Bad habits, Cold, Loveyou, Fistfulloftears.  Playing Possum is a title to an Alan Jackson song so whenever I see the title it reminds me of that song.  Playing Possum is standard maxwell, it's almost an acapella.  Vocally, this is a good cd from Maxwell, but none of the songs seem to be standouts like on his previous works. It will be interesting how this BlackSummersNite thing will evolve.
B000083C49|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies because of the humor, whales and, of course, the original Star Trek crew.  DVD commentaries and interviews are enjoyable upgrades from the VHS.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|This quickly-delivered boxed dvd set is a must for any Cohen fan. All the classics are here, and in a very intimate setting, lest the title mislead you. The Master is showing only small signs of slowing down and really takes his time, keeping up the interest level in even your lesser-favorite songs. I believe he's 74 at this show; thousands of younger acts should take in this treasure while we're lucky enough to still have him. This price is an absolute steal!
0307266303|4.0|This is a must-read for runners interested in improvement or just a change of pace!  It's a pretty awesome story that has a few flashbacks to stories about famous marathoners and ultramarathoners that the author has met along his journey.  Since reading this book, I have changed my running style, and I'm looking forward to trying to push myself even harder.    I read it within a week, and then immediately lent it to my running buddy.
1591391105|5.0|It's tough being the \\"newbie\\" whether it's your first day in a new high school chemistry class or your first day on the job managing 15+ direct reports. That's why Soundview highly recommends Michael Watkins book - \\"The First 90 Days.\\" Watkins is a Harvard Business School professor who outlines a useable \\"map\\" to help you navigate the first three months in nearly any managerial position. One of the key insights that Watkins makes is that leaders at any level of an organization are vulnerable during the first several weeks of a new job since they often lack the \\"institutional knowledge\\" that's necessary to get things done while avoiding landmines.  Additionally, he points out that failure to have an impact in the first 90 days usually dogs the executive for the remainder of their time with that specific organization. The First 90 Days will equip you with strategies and tools to get up to speed faster and achieve more sooner - it's definitely required reading for any \\"newbie.\\"

0312117337|4.0|If you're looking for a deck to predict the future or have fun telling fortunes, this deck probably isn't for you. Personally, I had a hard time starting out with this deck, since it was my first. It is much different from the traditional decks but I still like it. The artwork is amazing and is wonderful if you're interested in meditation or inner reflection.    It comes will a small book that has a description of each card. I had a hard time relating to what the text was saying, but the cards are pretty good at speaking for themselves.

B000058DFO|5.0|Having been a collector of Motown since 1974, and having amassed a huge collection in the process, Syreeta, despite the fact that she just didn't click with the record buyers in the USA, save one duet with Billy Preston that hit the Top 10, her name comes up rather often. Be it as a back-up singer, composer and an artist, Syreeta recorded a wealth of music for the massess to enjoy over a period from 1968 to the mid 1980's.  Syreeta is no longer with us, and it pains me to see so many former Motown artists pass away with hardly no recognition they so much deserve.  This 'best of' set includes the bulk of material that made her 'distinctive' in not just as an artist, but with how she presented herself. Yes, she did sing music 'of the day', but to hear her sing a ballad, one would think she was singing to just me. No fan of hers should pass this superbly priced set, and to those new Motown fans who may not know who she is, I do urge all to invest in this set, as her importance to music was strong.
B00005QGAX|5.0|Following up the largest selling album ever by far with an album this Bad was only a stunt that Michael Jackson could pull off. For me, I love this album as much as, if not more than Thriller. so if I give this five stars, maybe thriller should get six. This album contains some of the most memorable of MJ's tunes including Man in the Mirror and the outrageously funny title track that reinvented Michael Jackson as a tough-crotch grabbing mega-star.

0143038419|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. I discovered it last fall and have read it three times since, each time discovering something new or rediscovering something I had forgotten about myself. Elizabeth Gilbert's writing is fresh and real and very personable. As she journeyed not just around the world but from the depths of depression to healing and life anew, I too felt catharsis and rejuvenation. She balances seriousness with humor, philosophy with wit. It is broken into three sections, Italy, India and Indonesia, and at first that really bothered me because each section had such a different tone to it. Just when I got used to one it would change one me, and that was slightly annoying. But, in time I came to love and appreciate each section for its unique message. It all comes together when you look back at it in the end, radically different stories at first but pulled together as one. Please, please, please do yourself a favor and read this book.
0307266303|3.0|This is an interesting story about long-distance runners, interspersed with lightweight science about running.  As such, it is a bit of a ramble, but if you're looking for a good running story with some interesting ideas about running, you won't mind too much.  Nice beach reading, you know.    The story is well-told, though the writing does not count as beautiful (the style is that of a Men's fashion (er, \\"health\\") magazine).      The bits about the science of running are interesting, but a bit disappointing.  Unfortunately the author does not seem to appreciate precision or argument.  Perhaps the most egregious example: he shares some statistics about marathon times, that he uses as evidence that people get faster and faster (over long distances) until they peak at age 27.  The good news, he says, is that it takes them till age 64 to return to their 19 year old speed.    It seems these numbers came from averaging finishing times by age for a marathon.  If so, this hardly earns the claim.  19 year old marathoners are probably first-timers.  64 year old marathoners almost certainly are not.  It's misleading to compare experts vs. novices.    So you have to take all the ideas he presents with a grain of salt, and be left wondering how much there is to what he's suggested.    Nonetheless, a fun mess of a book.

B00005OMTT|5.0|Love Sensuality Devotion was the first Enigma album that I bought and from the first day that I bought it, I was never sorry.  I knew about about Enigma before buying this album since my dad listened to it when I was young.  I didn't remember any of the songs but became interested in the band/project when I was 14.  Looking at all of the Enigma CDs on the store shelf I decided to go with a Greatest Hits album and I am glad that I did.  The music is sort of a blend of new age, hip hop beats (or trip hop), and something else but it is unlike anything else out there.  You can listen to it quietly or pump up the volume and hear all of the little things hidden in this layered music.  This album represents the First World of Enigma and features music from the first 4 albums.  Hits like Sadeness, Mea Culpa, Beyond the Invisible, Return to Innocence are included.  This is a great album because it gives the listener a taste of Enigma music.  Now, I have all of the albums from the band/project but I still pop this one into my stereo.  If you have heard of Enigma or one of Enimga's songs and want to see what music Michael Cretu (the man behind Enigma) has to offer, check out this album. Beware of one thing though.  This album represents the first four albums. The albums that came after Love Sensuality Devotion have a different sound to them (although they still have that Enigma feel to them).  If you are a fan or just someone who is curious, check this album out!
0805080120|4.0|Dr. Deutscher has done a scholarly, thorough discussion on the roots of language, but I believe he started too late in time. I'm of the persuasion that language involves more than the spoken word. I find body language (which proponents argue communicate half of what we speak), facial expressions (think FACS, FBI, microexpressions), movement to be as telling of a person's intentions as words. Sometimes more so. Yet, he argues language was born when we could prove it was born--\\"...for how can anyone presume to know what went on in prehistoric times without indulging in make-believe?\\" \\"...impressive range of theories circulating for how the first words emerged: from shouts and calls; from hand gestures and sign language; from the ability to imitate...The point is that as long as there is no evidence, all these scenarios remain 'just so' stories.\\" Or deductive reasoning. Something the modern brain excels at. This despite the fact that his cover includes the popular ape-man image.<br /><br />Still, he adds humor and a highly intelligent discussion I thoroughly enjoyed.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I usually do not watch TV, except for an occasional NBA game or UFC fight, but after watching 1 or 2 episodes or Breakt Bad, I was hooked. There isn't a show on TV that feels as real as this sereries.

B00006EXL5|5.0|This album is an incredible record.      The story of MCR is that Gerard Way, the lead singer, saw the 9/11 events going on and saw people falling from the Twin Towers.  He realized after this that he had to do something with his life, instead of drawing cartoons for people all day, which he was doing for work.  He started My Chemical Romance with Matt Pelissier and Ray Toro, with Pelissier on drums and Toro on guitar.  They recorded a demo and handed it out to a few people, while looking for a bassist.  Gerard's younger brother, Mikey, played bass and after hearing the demo, decided to join.  Among the people that got the demo were the members of Pencey Prep.  After playing a few shows, My Chemical Romance signed to Eyeball Records, a local record label.  After Pencey Prep broke up, the lead singer/guitarist Frank Iero joined MCR as the rhythm guitarist, and the band headed into the studio. Even though Iero hadn't composed anything for My Chem at this point, he did add some parts to \\"Demolition Lovers\\" and \\"Early Sunsets Over Monroeville\\".    Thus, My Chemical Romance was born.    To tell the truth, this review is very biased.  It's biased because this is the record that saved my life, and turned it to music.  About four years ago, I was incredibly depressed and didn't know what I wanted to do with my life.  I didn't have any friends at school and I was starting to do stupid things to get what I wanted, like stealing money and food and pretty much whatever I wanted.  I stole this CD and a Plain White T's one as well, and started listening to them both.  My sister liked the PWT's, so she stole it from me and I had no choice but to listen to I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.  I could mosh to \\"Honey...\\" before I knew what moshing was, and I was hypnotized by the time that \\"Vampires Will Never Hurt You\\" was on.    After that, comes \\"Drowning Lessons\\", which has a great guitar riff and makes Ray Toro look like Slash.  Then comes \\"Our Lady of Sorrows,\\"one of the first MCR songs, and my personal favorite.  The great lyrics and metal/punk riffs will stick in your head until you are thinking My Chemical Romance all day.  After comes the first \\"emo\\" song by My Chemical Romance, called \\"Headfirst for Halos\\", which is a pop-punk song about a kid that's messed up and takes different pills to get different highs and thinks about suicide.  It's very catchy and if you aren't humming/singing \\"Our Lady of Sorrows\\" then you will definitely be singing \\"Headfirst for Halos\\".  After \\"Halos\\" is \\"Skylines and Turnstiles\\", the first MCR song that Gerard wrote to get over 9/11, and show everyone how he intended the band to be like.    The two most beautiful songs on the record are definitely \\"Early Sunsets Over Monroeville\\" and \\"Demolition Lovers\\", which are both slow and melodic symphony-like pieces.  They're both about two lovers that run away from their former lives, from the nightmares that they use to have to confront on a day to day basis, and the promise to shoot the other in the heart should they turn into a vampire.  They're great songs and if you're an emotional person you'll end up crying.  The songs in between are \\"Cubicles\\" and \\"This is the Best Day Ever\\", both like \\"Drowning Lessons\\", with great guitar riffs and catchy drums and memorable vocals that will not get My Chemical Romance off your mind.  I promise, this record will either save your life or make it better.  At least listen to it on Myspace, so you can say that you've heard it.  Then buy it, because it is very much worth it.  It's so much worth it that after I stole it, I looked for it at FYI and bought it as well, after returning the library's copy.  You will not regret buying this album.
0385340575|3.0|No way around it, Jack Reacher is one of the most compelling characters in contemporary suspense fiction.  I'd put Jane Whitefield up there with him, but damn few others.  Lee Child gets top marks for tight plotting and economical prose, as always, but Gone Tomorrow represents a nadir of background research in military matters unmatched since Reacher's second outing, Die Trying.  Military decorations play an important plot role, but Child clearly has made no effort to acquaint himself with the medals he mentions.  Likewise, he drags in the Soviet-Afghan War of the 1980s for background purposes but gets nearly everything wrong.  Now, Child's paranoid vision of \\"homeland security\\" in the USA is more than a bit over the top, but it drives the plot so we've got to give him a pass.  But there's only a certain degree of plausible suspension of disbelief we can muster when we see a major al-Qaeda operation involving many male operatives run by a woman.  (Al-Qaeda has much in common with terrorists from an earlier generation -- a famous Black Panther spokesman once said something to the effect that the position of women in the revolution is on their backs.)<br /><br />Face it -- Reacher is like the Borg, and I'm assimilated.  But it's frustrating that Lee Child saddles his great ex-military character and stellar plots with so much background detail that is wildly wrong.  A little research would go a long way.
0385338732|4.0|Remember Me? is my favorite Sophia kinsella novel (so far).  While I enjoy the frantic, \\"I can't believe I've gotten myself into this mess\\" of the other Kinsella novels, I enjoyed the realness of this novel.<br /><br />A girl wakes up from after an accident, finding all of her aspirations have come true.  She's the boss, she's married to an incredibly rich and handsome man, she has more shoes than God.... and yet, she (the 3 years earlier she) feels like there is something missing.

1416550542|5.0|If you are a lover of the fairytale myths and the wonderful stories of Enid Blyton, you will so adore this book. It carries you through three different time zones with ease and flow. The characters are full and flawed,and in particular the descriptions of the Cornish country side and coast are incredibly beautiful I swear I could smell the sea as Kate Morton wrote about it! I loved how the author sprinkled fairy stories within the pages, and it goes to show how great a writer she is as every story is full, interesting and multi-layered. If I was a writer, THIS would be the book I would want to have written.
0688163173|2.0|As others have said, the ending is a mystery story cliche, and not done half as well as other such stories.  The most disappointing part of that, however, was the fact that up to the ending, the writing was quite good and the story was engaging, but I can't forgive the author for that ending.  I won't read any other Dennis Lehane books as a result.
B000AP04L0|5.0|Seriously funny stuff. I'd have to say that there are a ton and a half catch phrases I use often at work from this excellent movie. With 500 5 star reviews, I doubt very much that you need a review of the story, so I'll just say that it's a fantastic goof on the world's worst workplace: Every office cube farm in America. As a administrative worker of 15 years, who has spent far to much time in one cube farm or another, I found this movie very relatable and pretty hysterical. No, I don't hate my job, as some other reviewers have stated. Yes, I do have the moron boss that pawns his work off on me. (dosn't everyone? I do a better job anyway.) I won't \\"burn the place to the ground\\" one day. (why bother?) But I may just \\"office space\\" that super-delux copier that never works properly one day when no one is looking! LOL
B0009XNUK0|5.0|If you've been looking for the best Michael Jackson greatest hits CD to remember him by, then look no further, The Essential trumps all previous collections by including his biggest hits from the albums. Sure, it is missing a few songs (Who's Loving You, I'll Be There, Mama's Pearl, Never Can Say Goodbye, Say Say Say, Give In To Me, Scream, Earth Song, Stranger in Moscow, Butterflies etc...all easily downloadable) and album versions would've been preferred but no quibble, this IS THE BEST MJ RETROSPECTIVE RELEASED YET!

B001S86J2Q|2.0|Don't need to review the movie itself: if you are a fan of \\"Grease,\\" you don't need to be sold on its pleasures. The Blu-ray \\"Rockin' Rydell Edition,\\" however, requires some comment.<br /><br />The overall picture is very good: colors are sharp, not overly saturated, good detail. No complaints -- the video transfer is pleasing.<br /><br />The AUDIO, on the other hand, is awful. The soundtrack musical numbers are clear and actually improved upon in 5.1 surround. But the dialog track is astonishingly muddy. There is a noticeable difference between the audio quality of the dialog and that of the musical numbers. I thought it was just my imagination until, after viewing, my wife made a comment about how hard it was to hear the dialog. This was a major disappointment, and for that reason, I would not recommend the Blu-ray edition.<br /><br />Haven't watched all of the extras yet, but they are as expected, fun but nothing you probably didn't already know if you are a fan of the film.

Simon also gets thrown in to the mix and so does Clary's mom's friend Luke. Will Clary be able to handle this all.<br />City of Bones is the beginning of one of my favorite series. It is funny. It is over before you want it to be and you will be waiting for the next book. The characters are fantastic. Jace is one of my favorite characters ever. Simon is sarcastic and sweet. Isabelle is strong willed and sassy. Alec is multidimensional and honest. Luke is awesome. Valentine is... evil. I loved how Clare created such a great setting. I love how the setting of New York hides all these creatures. If you haven't read this, get started on it as soon as possible

I have spent too much time in hospitals, so I know the standard layout. I also have been to Eugene, Oregon and it was well described. The approach of the plot was well done and original. I also loved the flashbacks of Mia's past. Forman is also a great writer and I can't wait to read more of her books.

This book was wonderful at helping with that plan . . . the online tool was just what I needed to assist in identifying strengths (and weaknesses) and I was able to make improvements to my resume based on the feedback from the web site.  The book itself is filled with very useful information that will help me when it comes time to interview.  I highly recommend this book - it is an easy read and really does have very helpful information.
B001AW156U|5.0|It's amazing what two little pieces of plastic can accomplish when designed so well.  These two accessories are easy to snap onto the L2 and R2 buttons, and they are just as easy to remove, leaving no damage to the controller.<br /><br />The concave curves not only keep your fingers from slipping off, but they also feel more like the triggers of a gun, which is great for shooters.  After playing multiple games for several hours, the buttons manage to stay on extremely well, and add to my overall gameplay enjoyment.<br /><br />The Real Triggers are a huge improvement over the original L2/R2 designs, and Sony could really learn a thing or two from Gioteck.  Until then, this is one of the cheapest and best PS3-related purchases you can make!
B001EN71CW|4.0|Ahh Firefly.  My favorite Josh Whedon series.  Something about it just grabs me...maybe the Western music, combined with sci-fi gun fights, in the melting pot of the new universe is just new and fresh.  Or maybe it's the comic relief sprinkled in between dramatic scenes.  Either way, I've been tracking this visually cool series for a BluRay release for months and months, and now I'm not let down.  I used to watch this series in standard definition, and now I know what I was missing with the BluRay version...there's a whole lot more in the frame than just the actors, and there's a lot more sound, too, with the BluRay version.  Well worth the UPGRADE from DVD, let alone a new purchase.
B000SXMS54|5.0|i mean, if you're not already into radiohead, forget it. start with ok computer or in rainbows. and even if you are a fan, you have to be totally detached from the rest of the world when you listen to this album. because everyone else will call you crazy and you'll realize that outside of being a fan, all your friends are right and this album is total garbage. you have to love radiohead or else the album makes no sense. but... if you do love radiohead its quite a wonderful experience.<br />its also really unfair that amnesiac has been given the ever illustrious title \\"kid b\\". because its just as good or better as kid a. true, its not that different. its the same sessions as kid a, but i think it can stand alone as a separate album. one of the reasons being that, in my opinion, its up to the standard of normal radiohead music, which, again in my opinon, is an excellent album as a whole as well as songs that can stand by themselves just as well as in the album.<br /><br />so if you've never heard the name radiohead before in your life, please dont buy THIS album. i'd suggest the bends, ok computer, and/or in rainbows. then move onto hail to the thief (aka best radiohead ever!), and then if you're still breathing go for kid a and amnesiac.

If it didn't feature the Indiana Jones character (or, rather, a pale facsimile thereof) no one would bother seeing it or giving it more than three stars (to be charitable).  The gaping plot holes, shoddy dialogue, overuse of CGI, and over-the-top-unbelievable action sequences have been amply covered by other reviewers, so I won't rehash them here.  I'll just respond to those who claim that it's \\"only entertainment\\" that the movie doesn't even work on that level.  \\"The Mummy\\" is a fun, entertaining movie; \\"Crystal Skull\\" is a plodding exhumation of a franchise that should have ended with \\"Last Crusade.\\"

B000V1Y43W|5.0|Another Pixar success story.  This film will suit a young girl or boy.  Even though it's about cars, there are girl cars and boy cars in the movie.  My son, who is 22 months, enjoys this film as he enjoys matchboxes and real cars on the road.  Highly recommended.

B001EOQWF8|5.0|My 22 month old son loves this film.  He will sit and watch it from start to end.  The best thing about this movie is that there is limited talking, so a very young child can watch what's happening and not need to have a big vocabulary to enjoy it.
B001TODCII|5.0|This movie was just...wow, just wow.  I rented it because I was worried that it wouldn't be good and as each minute of the film passed, I found myself upset that I didn't just outright buy the movie.  I couldn't recommend a better movie than this!!!!  buy it now, buy it now
B0017MO10U|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing this next Stargate movie after seeing the very well made conclusion movie \\"Ark of Truth\\".   Unfortunately as some have already pointed out, it was a disappointment. Others have already touched on the mediocre story and predictable \\"coincidences\\". I haven't read through all of the reviews so maybe someone else has mentioned this problem. Basically, as of this review, the voices/sound of the actors on the dvd is horrible. It's as though they ran out of money so they couldn't afford to overdub the actors voices and simply went with the sound that was recorded in the scene no matter how bad it was, ie; reverb, echos, barely audible, etc. I gave it 3 stars just because I love Stargate and the actors, but it's sad to think they are ending these adventures with this substandard last entry.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|This is a fun little thrill ride. What I liked most about the movie was how true to the comic the storylines were and the outfits.  All in all, the only thing I didn't really like about the film was how it felt like all the other comic action movies like 300 and Sin City as of late with this forced noir feel about it.  That aside, great movie I highly recommend.  I will be buying this when it comes out.
630463949X|5.0|As an owner of both the CD and DVD of \\"The Dance\\" I am so glad I got the DVD first. While you can hear the emotions on the CD, its even more amazing to see them on film. None the more prevalent then on \\"Go Insane\\" (one of Lindsey's great solos) \\"Landslide\\" (seeing how emotional Lindsey and Stevie get makes the VIEWER emotional, especailly the embrace at the end) and \\"Silver Springs\\" This was a track left off \\"Rumours\\" and it devestated Stevie for a long time. It became the B-Side to the \\"Go Your Own Way\\" single and developed a cult-like following amongst fans. I personally did not care for the original but ADORE this version. Stevie's emotions are about as raw as it gets and you can see it in the looks she gives Lindsey as she is singing (especially in the last minute of the song) This DVD was a treat in other ways too...seeing Mick having a blast on the drums (in particular before \\"My Little Demon\\" while Lindsey talks about inner demons and is inturrupted by Mick taping on the tom) Another treat is on \\"Say You Love Me\\" when Chrissy drags John out from the background to sing. It is nice to see these two exes who went through such a bitter divorce being on friendly terms. I love the eoncores \\"Tusk\\" with the present SC marching trojans and they stay on for \\"Don't Stop\\" (which sounds awesome with a brass section for the first time) The last song is a solo Chrissy at the piano doing \\"Songbird\\" It raises a question...did the rest of the group KNOW she was planning to step away from touring after this tour and wanted to let her have her moment? A truly emotionally charged night and worth every penny! Timeless music from true icons...
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I usually am not a big fan of Clint Eastwood or the movies he makes and that's why I waited so long to see this one.  That was until I started hearing EVERYONE saying how great it was.  From my little sister to my elderly grandfather and all in between...they all said it was one of the better movies they have ever seen.  With the credits on the screen now rolling, I agree.  It's one of the finer movies I've seen at least this year.      The only thing I would tell people going into it is beware of racism.  Pretty much any and all racial slurs are used in this movie.  It didn't bother me because that's how it is.      Also a special spot in my heart is that this was in part filmed in and near Detroit, where I live.      If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor, shell out the money to buy it and do just that....buy it.  Watch it, love it.  You won't be disappointed!

1592402690|5.0|Even if you are a casual Beatles fan, you will want to read this book.    Why?    1. It provides insights into their behind-the-scenes personalities by an impartial observer who knew them well    2. The incredible creative process that went into their music is documented in detail by the man that made it so    Is there any other reason why one would want to read this book?    How about the fact that it is so well written that I found it very difficult to put down.  Emerick's own insecurities are freely discussed as he dealt with the creative genius of the Beatles.  And even more compelling is the obvious fact that Emerick's own genius was awakened by the magic and power of their creative spirits.    It becomes perfectly obvious that he was meant to help them to become what they are: \\"...the greatest cultural phenomenon the world has ever witnessed.\\"    Need I say more?  READ THIS BOOK!

B0029NY9YO|4.0|I'm a big fan of the graphic novel, so like many I held this movie up to the original when watching it.     Visually, it's a better-than dead-on match, from costume design to story telling, and from lighting to action scenes. Plot wise, I felt the theatrical release, which I just watched on DVD was good, but just too slow in the beginning. In this ever-impatient world we live in, it makes sense that a big piece of the audience would complain. But, if you're a fan of sophisticated tales, take an interest in plot development and appreciate non-linear story telling, you are going to enjoy this movie. Personally, I wasn't impressed with some of the music choices, but I especially loved all of the orchestra tracks.    My last comment is on the non-linear storytelling approach. The graphic novel does it well, seemingly unforgiving to the reader in its transitions and open-ended plot lines--making you wait for more, then nearly forcing you to forget what you were waiting for before bringing you back--but yet the movie would have faired better off from less of that stylization. For a first view, with no prior knowledge of the plot, the movie can be painfully confusing. For the connoisseur who appreciates the value of the under-painting, this is a work of art worth going back to again and again.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|There is a song in this collection, \\"Significant Other,\\" that, like a lucid dream, defies explanation.

0307455874|4.0|I found his chapter on Faith to be hard to swallow, not because I didn't like what he had to say (though I didn't at times), but because I think he didn't like what he [had] to say.    The notion that life is so abysmal, so empty and thankless as to make us desire a higher meaning and explanation--is not only a shallow sales pitch that tries to convince the individual to believe in god--its so simplistic, two-dimensional and unsophisticated that its just impossible to believe this is Obama's real explanation. As the rest of the book exhibits, he's clearly smarter than that. To make any assumption as to why he claims he believes in the Christian deity would be futile and arrogant--except to consider that he is saying what [needs] to be said in order to please a very large electoral base.    The only part I found believable was that he enjoys the good company of the Black Church.     As most smart people know (even those desperately in fear of an end by death), it's not the achievement of a goal that provides the source of salvation, gratification and a meaning to life, but the journey itself. I suppose for those in need of a more easily digestible answer--a way out of fear, a way into instant gratification--religion can offer a satisfying comfort.    Obama clearly mentions his dissatisfaction with our society's lack of appreciation in relation to the absence of \\"delayed gratification\\"--a clear hypocrisy compared to his explanation of his religious beliefs. Getting past his mention of \\"non-believers\\" (more than once), he goes further by spelling out an agnostic perspective--admitting he doesn't know what happens when we die. These are not the words of a \\"believer\\"--this is an intellectual with thoughts grounded in truth, science, reason and good sense on the prowl to find common ground within any subject.
B001EN71CW|3.0|It's not that I don't love this show (I do) or found anything wrong with the ultra-slim design and delivery of this product, it's that I feel slightly cheated by the claims that this is a blu-ray disc.    It's true, that this product does indeed play in a blu-ray player, and that the occasionally late-added cut scene, or graphic display, appears to be as crisp and stunning as my copy of Iron Man, but most of this series, for money-saving effect or just because it wasn't popular at the time, was not filmed in blu-ray, meaning most of this DVD is just the same show in the same format I would get if I bought the DVD.    I didn't really need the discs, but when the deal came through my inbox AND it was blu-ray, I jumped on it. I'm not mad about my purchase, just slightly disappointed in the final outcome.

1416955070|4.0|The mortal instruments series is certainly an entertaining read (mostly).  Although Clare isn't always the most original writer she does a good job telling a story and keeping the reader interested.  That's where the good news ends.  She has pretty poor character development until the third book of the series which by the time you get there you'll be frustrated by slow talking scenes and ready for the thing to get over with.  If you're a liker of happy endings then you'll be FURIOUS with the first two books because their endings are aweful!  But luckily the series ends happily so stay hopeful.  The dialogue is VERY poorly done and almost every conversation has \\"Don't\\" used as a conversation stopper.  In the first two books just about every conversation is interrupted by some dramatic moment, it gets REALLY annoying.  But other than those complaints the series is certainly enjoyable, and certainly has its controversial moments.

B00005JGAB|5.0|I've always held in my mind the idea that the Ramones are without a doubt the band that changed the music scene forever. Since the bands first performance in the famed CBGB's club they have, over the decades, gained a wall of recognition as being something new and influential for the time. Around 1974 when the Ramones first started out, the mainstream scene mainly comprised of cheesy pop songs and mellowed hippie rock. The Ramones were something different in their frantic playing of the instruments and raw vocals, they were simply a band that didn't care to create an image, and they just liked making the music they wanted. The Ramones spearheaded the Punk movement and lived the ideology of being original in everything you do and not conforming to a boring clich&eacute; idea of what is considered a good performance.<br /><br />This album allows casual music fans to enjoy a taste of some of the Ramones best and most energetic music they have created over the years. The first song off this album is the fantastically energetic Blitzkrieg Bop which presents such a forceful sound and pace that makes you wish that, if you weren't around during this uprising, that you actually were around to be a part of it. The line \\"Hey Ho, Let's Go\\" from that song is synonymous with the whole forcefulness of what the punk ideology developed into. It morphed into this \\"get out of my way\\" aggression and the philosophy of \\"I'm better than you because I'm original.\\" Maybe this wasn't the intention of the Ramones, but when bands such as the Sex Pistols came to mainstream attention, that aggression was certainly projected and it definitely won the war for individuality which was started by the Ramones.<br /><br />The sound of the Ramones to many may seem quite confused and disorganised which is partly their appeal as the sound is raw and untainted by the corrupting intrusion of a computer. This is certainly a marvellous album and my only regret is it doesn't contain the brilliant Joey Ramone solo track, the cover of the Louis Armstrong classic \\"What a wonderful world.\\"<br /><br />Top 5 are:<br />1. Blitzkrieg Bop<br />2. Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue<br />3. I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend<br />4. Judy Is A Punk<br />5.

0375842209|4.0|Zusak's description of Germany at war is well-balanced. He describes the  marching of emaciated jews through Molching and also the allied bombing of German cities.The former evokes our deep pity; at same time we cannot but feel some sympathy for the civilian population under such bombardment.    Hans Hubermann, a veteran of the first war, who shows his humanity by offering a piece of bread to an emaciated jew in the march, is a great character.Sweet, stoic and eternally grateful to a fellw soldier, a jew, who saved his life in the first war, he gives asylum to the jew's son  in his basement at no small risk to himself and his family. Zusak's description of allied bombing of Molching which kills Hubermann and his wife and so many others while asleep and of the work of the Air-Raid Special Unit,clearing the dead and the rubble of a bombed city does call for our sympathy for the suffering of the cvilian population of Germany. No doubt, a large number of them brought it on themselves, like Hansi Junior or Frau Diller. But there were also others like Hubemann who did not deserve such a fate.Rosa Hubermann, his wife, dour with a heart of gold follows her husband's wishes and accommodates the jew.   Liesel is the central piece in the story. A most loveable character.She steals books to read them and educate herself: she joins in stealing apples  show her solidarity with her calf-love:and finally she says she had hated the words and loved them in writing her story. If we look at the way Hitler used words, it is clear that words could stimulate fanatcal passions.   One should read the whole novel to appreciae Liesel's loyalty, love for her foster parents, particularly Hubermann, and finaly her adult gravity.
1573300403|5.0|Who'd ever think I'd end up picking up this DVD,something I've thought of doing for years right after his passing?Hopping on the bandwagon?Nope. Just seemed as right a time as any. I picked this one up because looking at the video selection I could see that this was a very interesting video collection. Unlike a lot of people in this day and age Michael Jackson is less interesting to me as a phenomenon than as a musical entity. And that is what you get here-14 videos and 1 hour,46 minutes of MJ videos. Michael's musical talent had two parts:one audio and one visual and both were equally as penetrating and powerful.This is a double sided DVD.On the first side...well sentimentality aside you get Michael Jackson at the height of his game,doing his famous dance on Motown 25.It's called the backstep (the moonwalk is the same basic move done in a circle) but by whatever name it's the dance that propelled Michael into an entertainer in the league of Sammy Davis and Fred Astaire. Between \\"Smooth Criminal\\",\\"Thriller\\" and \\"Beat It\\" you see more of MJ doing his stuff that dazzled me and everyone else in the 80's.You could be cynical now and say \\"well he ripped off his moves from James Brown or whoever and just made them faster paced\\" but I don't;not even people who try today can move exactly the way he does.Here he was in a league of his own.\\"Liberian Girl\\" is very atypical of an MJ video as it takes the form of a comical rehersal featuring some of MJ's celebrity friends-he himself only makes a brief appearance at the end. His 1995 American Music Awards performance point to some of the content on the second side of the DVD. Six of the eight videos featured on it are from his intense 1995 album [[ASIN:B0000029LG HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]] and find a very different Michael Jackson,a man with a broken reputation and in a far more uncertain place.Because each video tells a different kind of story I'll review them seperately:<br />SCREAM<br /> Actually one of my favorite of Michaels later videos,this duet with sister Janet features a busy,angry mixture of sci-fi and different forms of emotional metaphores from smashing guitars Pete Townsand style to anime and other things I'm not sure of.It's one of his angriest songs and the video is a great document of internal torment<br />CHILDHOOD<br /> Yes the video is overly cutesy and it's clear it was set up to inspire a lot of MJ bleeding heart-ism.But whether he sacrificed his childhood for the benifit of our entertainment or not it's rather strange for him to emphasize the issue of his childhood and other children (floating in the sky on boats Peter Pan style) in this kind of way.It's one of his most personal songs even if the video seems a bit planned.<br />YOU ARE NOT ALONE<br />  This video says more about Michaels personal life than it planned. An overly effeminine looking MJ is seen rather withdrawn from his obviously wanton wife Lisa Marie and,an image of him with angel wings aside is a non to sudtle expression of his romantic uncertainties.It's a bit too alienated feeling to be really sexy but it isn't a bad video and great to watch.<br />EARTH SONG<br />  A video such as this is something I support for the most part.Michael is clearly saddened genuinely by the terrible plight of environmental damage and war.And the imagry of poached elephants,pollution,starvation and despire WILL make you think about what we don't often see or choose to see.But.....the ending is rather questionable:Michael depicting himself as some biblical type hero who alone has the power to reverse the worlds ills and wrongs. Not to speak ill of the dead but is this his take on benevolance or...a distressing detour into near full blown meglomania? Maybe both,maybe neither.Either way it's an amazing visual experience,if having more questions than answers.<br />THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT US<br />  Here's a great video!Michael dancing through the streets with a chorus of drummers.Even though he's indulging in some heavy self victimization here (the infamous \\"jew me/sue me\\" line is carefully rolled over with pounding drums so as not to be heard) it's great to see Michael dancing again in his videos,even if it's in a more angry state of mind.<br />STRANGER IN MOSCOW<br />  Dealing with depression in video was kind of overdone during the 90's (sorry) but this again says more about MJ's state of mind at the time than it probably meant to. Another B&W video here Michael is NOT dancing happily but taking a sad,lonely walk through a dank,rainy city where time itself draws to a hault.Considering his situation from this point until now..........this is the most haunting visualization of his woes of later life.<br />BLOOD ON THE DANCEFLOOR<br />  Admitedly this was from a time where Michael Jackson's transformation from respected performer/singer/composer into a huge media circus was a bit of a turn off for me. Michael is a rather static figure here at a funky retro 70's dance party and there are similarities to \\"Smooth Criminal\\" and \\"Thriller\\". But it's kind of repeating past glories and isn't saying anything all that new for him in the video arena.<br /><br />  The ending of the video is kind of a long litany of the...well kind of idolotry that REALLY turned me off.Of course it begins the same way with the VERY infamous HIStory teaser that....well it's hard not to see it as either an expression (or parody) of pure meglomania and self obsession.Whatever it was based on,either that or Michael's yearning to to an epic film about his own idolotry is still a mystery. It's beyond over the top and is the only thing here or that Michael had ever done that qualifies as kitch to me. But that luckily doesn't take too much away from the other marvels,old and new to be found on this DVD that serve to remind us of his talents in the medium of music video.elf victimization here (the infamous \\"jew me/sue me\\" line is carefully rolled over with pounding drums so as not to be heard) it's great to see Michael dancing again in his videos,even if it's in a more angry state of mind.

B0028K31CE|3.0|The album for the most part is pretty much what you'll expect from Maxwell. Alot of cool laidback jazzy soul. It is not as upbeat as Maxwell's previous albums. The majority of  the 9 songs (yes only 9 songs) are more the style of Lifetime than upbeat style of Cococure.    The Maxwell faithful will probably enjoy this release more than someone new to Maxwell's music. For some the album  may be a disappointment for those seeking a more grandiose entry back onto music scene from Neo-Soul King.    Although I enjoyed his previous albums more I think this is  still a decent release from Maxwell and from somebody who has been absent from the musical landscape for a number of years.    Though the album may be more on the slow side it does have hints of that feel good upbeat soul of Maxwell of previous years.    The track \\"Fistful Of Tears\\" is reminiscent of 1999's \\"Fortunate\\". The song \\"Help Somebody\\" is classic Maxwell in the vein of \\"Sumthin Sumthin\\". And the track \\"Love You\\" is  indeed Maxwell redux....Maxwell for a new generation of Neo-Soul listeners. If this what Maxwell has planned for the future, and I believe he does, we will hearing more great music from Neo-Soul master we know and love.    All in all it's great to have Maxwell in back in action. Hearing his voice on Alchemist's Smile earlier this year I'm sure brought back many good memories for those who remember Maxwell back in day. Now we have this nice 9 song album to help us create new memories.
0439023491|5.0|Against staggering odds, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark of District 12 have somehow won the annual Hunger Games. But the fruits of triumph are bittersweet. Success in the arena means a life without want in the Victor's Village, but extravagant food and a nice place to sleep can only provide so much comfort when an increasing amount of one's life must be faked for the protection of those one loves. That's exactly Katniss's predicament, because she when she held up the poisonous berries in the arena, it was interpreted as an act of defiance against the Capitol rather than Katniss's strong will to life. And now the girl on fire has become the spark for rebellion--a rebellion the Capitol is determined to stamp out at any cost.<br /><br />I must commend Collins for writing such a phenomenal sequel to The Hunger Games as Catching Fire is. It's everything I hoped for and even more than I expected. Katniss's legend lives on in this action packed, suspense filled drama in which one's friends are nearly indistinguishable from one's enemies and ambiguous meanings make life into one giant maze. Collins takes her portrayal of a dystopian future to the next level in this novel by highlighting the extent of the power the totalitarian Capitol wields and the beginnings of long suppressed dissent. Catching Fire is such an engrossing read, thanks to Collins's well written and executed plot, vivid and realistic characters, and the resulting sense of revolutionary fear. It's so easy to lose track of time while reading this novel, because the story just flows from the page so fluidly; I really enjoyed the many plot twists and the development of each character. The only times I had to pause while reading were due to the multitude of names and minor characters that are somewhat difficult to remember. But overall, Catching Fire is a story so overwhelmingly incredible, no reader will want to put it down.<br /><br />Catching Fire and its prequel The Hunger Games are must reads for all readers not just because they are such interesting stories but because they show the nasty side of politics and culture not enough of us are aware of. This trilogy will be especially enjoyed by fans of the Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld, Cherry Heaven by L.J. Adlington, Shift by Charlotte Agell, Daylight Runner by Ois&iacute;n McGann, and the Poison Study trilogy by Maria V. Snyder.

A poor boy from the slums of India manages to get onto a  trivia game show just like \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\\" with Howie Mandel. As he gets closer and closer to the multi-million jackpot we see his life played out before us. He has endured many things since childhood, mostly torment including his mothers death. The one light of his life is a girl he met when he was young. Most of the movie reflects his trying to track her down after their separation. Good drama and good production. Good quality DVD with a few features. Decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch [[ASIN:B000KHX70S Cave of the Yellow Dog]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am glad I purchsed this DVD along with \\"No More Trouble Zones\\". I have been doing it 4 times a week for about 3 weeks and am up to Level 3. It is tough but you need to stay with it. I do \\"No More Trouble Zones\\" once or twice a week. I can definately tell a difference in my arms, butt, and abs. I do wish it had a little more for legs and outer thighs. Overall, I am very pleased and will keep with it. If you want a shorter, but tough, workout that really works, I suggest you try this DVD.

0810995212|5.0|J.C. Leyendecker is one of my favourite illustrators. I am delighted that after 34 years there is finally a new book about this great artist. Sure the book may have some errors in the text, but being an artist myself this book written by Laurence S. Cutler and Judy Goffman Cutler is a real eye opener. It has an abundance of artwork and what I am most interested in the studies of the artwork. Leyendecker made studies in oil. The book shows a lot of those studies. It gives you a perfect insight on how Leyendecker composited his artwork. The publisher has done a great job in capturing the true colours of Leyendecker's artwork. There is a big difference between the printed covers of \\"The Saturday Evening Post\\" and the original art.    The lithography of the original art of Leyendecker is stunning and much better then the lithography in the book by Michael Schau. If you love good art and want to be amazed by one of the finest American illustrator's this is the book for you!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This Series is phenomenal, well where do I begin. I firstly got hooked with the Sookie Stackhouse books, her charcater is just brilliantly written. The stories are so convoluted and multi stranded. Because you have at least 3 stories that are seperate yet interwoven it keeps you hooked. And the DVD series has some how completely encapsulated this without losing any of the style or special magic.    The casting is inspired, Sookie & Bill (Anna and Stephen have such chemistry I could almost bite them myself). But Jason's character shallow as puddle but still lovely deep down and my absolute my favourite Lafayette \\"just hold the aids and tip your waitress\\" inspired.    So if you are thinking about buying anything this year, buy TRUE BLOOD it is just the best Vampire / mystery / love / relationship series I have seen in years. I cannot recommend enough. I also recommend Amazon they are great.
B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Woody Allen movies are nearly always can't-miss affairs. His humor can be broad or dry, but it's always a treat to watch the endless combinations of the common neuroses and foibles of his New York characters. In \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona ,\\" he launches three personalities into his comic maelstrom. There's conventional and soon-be-married Vicky (Rebecca Hall), nutty/slutty Cristina (Scarlett Johansson ) and volcanically sexy Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). Vicky and Christina are in Barcelona for a vacation before Vicky's wedding to a rich but dull stocks analyst. A chance encounter at an art show and a restaurant brings them into the orbit of Juan Antonio, who quickly and nonchalantly offers to make love to both of them. Vicky and Christina find the offer simultaneously repellent and intriguing, setting the plot into motion.<br /><br />I'm not sure what caused this movie to fail. The voice-over narration, used lamely to lend comic irony to the characters' inner feelings, did not help. That a film needs narration to explain itself is always a bad sign. Perhaps Allen asked too much of Bardem and Hall, who seemed incapable of portraying the complexity of character that makes Allen's characters so memorable. An hour into this comedy, my wife and I both wondered what we were missing. Penelope Cruz provided a ray of light, playing Maria Elena, Bardem's sexy and unstable ex-wife. Oscar notwithstanding, her performance was so-so, though in comparison with the dullness of her co-stars, it was positively brilliant.<br /><br />\\"Vicky Christina Barcelona\\" was a real disappointment. Let's hope that this is simply a rare miss on Allen's part and not the sign that his creative days have come to an end.

1416950176|4.0|According to Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi, the text of this story was left for them by three mystery kids.<br /><br />With that stab at blurring the boundaries between fantasy and reality, these two authors slip easily into a haunted house tale that rapidly blossoms into a story of hidden fae and strange creatures. The first of the Spiderwick Chronicles -- \\"The Field Guide\\" -- is a staggering brief story that sets up mysteries, marvels and everything that come after.<br /><br />After their parents' divorce, the Grace kids -- teenage Mallory and nine-year-old twins Jared and Simon -- move with their mother to a crumbling old Victorian house, owned by a weird old aunt. Jared is having a rough time with all of this, but he's distracted from his personal woes by a \\"squirrel\\" scuttling around inside the walls. And their investigations reveal a strange little stash of items that were obviously not taken by a squirrel.<br /><br />An exploratory trip in a dumbwaiter takes Jared to a hidden library full of strange books on mythic creatures -- and soon strange things start happening to the family. Jared's further investigations uncover a strange little book called \\"Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide To The Fantastical World Around You,\\" a little guide to faery creatures. Jared begins to believe that the unbelievable might be true -- that there are faeries causing trouble in his new home -- but his siblings are a bit more reluctant.<br /><br />For the record, \\"The Field Guide\\" is a short book in a short series full of short books. It's only about a hundred pages of heavily-illustrated text, and we're not talking large pages. It's more like the first chapters of a longer novel -- and it ends on a bit of a cliffhanger.<br /><br />But Holly Black's writing style definitely makes it worth reading. Though the storyline is pretty simple, she weaves a web of subtle, eerie strangeness around the seemingly ordinary circumstances, and builds an increasing sense of dusty, leaf-strewn age around the house. And despite the Victorian house, the sprites and faery creatures here are anything but Victorian -- sometimes ugly, bizarre or malicious (such as when Mallory's hair is tied to her bed).<br /><br />And Tony DiTerlizzi's artwork is simply perfect for the story that he and Black are telling. He crafts lots of intricate pen-and-ink drawings, shadowy depictions of the decayed Victorian mansion, and illustrations of the weirder aspects of the Spiderwick estate (like the dusty library, or the vaguely Satanic door-knocker). The highlights are the old scribbled-on papers of Arthur Spiderwick, including a picture of a household boggart.<br /><br />The main characters are also quite believable: Mallory is a loving but slightly brittle teenager, and the mom is clearly struggling to stay afloat after her divorce. And the twins Jared and Simon (who can be told apart by their hairstyles) make good protagonists for the book, especially since they're so different -- Simon is a tidy animal enthusiast, while the more prominent Jared is a kid who is starting to sink into trouble after his parents' divorce.<br /><br />\\"The Field Guide\\" is a good opening chapter for the Spiderwick Chronicles, building up a sense of suspense, eerie fantasy and otherworldly creatures. Just have the second part on hand before you finish.torian house, the sprites and faery creatures here are anything but Victorian -- sometimes ugly, bizarre or malicious (such as when Mallory's hair is tied to her bed).

0312567448|4.0|This is a very nice book that contains amazing love letters written by famous people in history.  I believe it contains most of (if not all) the letters in the book used in the Sex & The City movie.  It is simply done in a different format.  (Smaller book, prettier cover).  I wish that Ursula Doyle would have included love letters from some more recent celebrities.  The most recent one mentioned in this book is G. K. Chesterton who lived from 1874-1936.  This is an interesting account of how men wrote to their loves in earlier days.  I particularly like the one written by Ludwig van Beethoven.
0399230033|4.0|Good Night Gorilla is a charming, nearly-wordless book about a gorilla living in a zoo.  When the zookeeper bids the animals good night one-by-one, the gorilla filches the ring of colored keys from his belt and lets himself out of his cage.  He then follows him around the zoo, matching the keys to the cages of the same color, and letting the animals out.  The animals parade quietly behind the zookeeper as he walks home across a field, bids his wife goodnight and turns off the light.  When all of the animals answer her \\"Good night, dear,\\" the wife gets up and returns them to their cages, except for the gorilla who sneaks out a second time to steal back into the couple's bed.<br /><br />The simple humor of this story is very accessible to young children, and the bright artwork, softened by evening shadows, evokes a warm, comforting mood.  Children will enjoy the absurdity of animals trooping into a human house, and delight in being \\"in the know\\" about the gorilla's secret plan.  As in the Curious George books, children may vicariously enjoy the gorilla's mischievous actions, then enjoy his warm feeling of security as he happily falls asleep between the husband and wife who care for him.<br /><br />(Families who feel strongly that children belong in their own beds may want to read this book with an instruction not to follow Gorilla's example.)
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|I first heard Adele sing 'Chasing Pavements' on either Letterman or Leno.  Anyway, I thought she had a very distinctive, bluesy kind of sound.  Every track on this CD is just as good as Chasing Pavements.  If you like that song, buy the CD.  You won't regret it!  Some tracks are bluesy, some are more upbeat.  Adele is an amazing talent that I believe will continue to create great music.
B0011UJMK2|2.0|Good premise and the social commentary is interesting, but the story was underdeveloped and the \\"solution\\" to the mystery was neither shocking nor believable.

1433502445|5.0|I have a lot of bibles, but this is by far the greatest study bible ever.  There is so much information, so much insight into many scriptures.  I purchased the leather bible, it is very nice.  The pages are easy to turn, the pictures are great, they have a lot of information with them.  I have used a lot of different study bibles, the ESV is all I need now.  Anyone who purchases this bible will not be disappointed.
0066620996|3.0|On its face, it may appear that concepts such as hiring the right people (and removing the wrong people), facing the brutal facts (and having faith), and creating a culture of discipline reflect common sense, but in reality, these \\"simple\\" concepts are hard to apply on a consistent, company-wide basis.     Collins presents the factors (as deduced through methodical research) that distinguish a great company from a good company...and a great company is one that has a breakthrough - and is able to sustain that breakthrough for a number of years. Even though a few of the companies have since met some hard times, I do not think this fact diminishes the quality of the findings. Great companies will inevitably meet hardships. After all, these companies do not live in a vacuum. It is how they respond and whether they continue to adhere to the concepts articulated in the book that will determine whether the company will remain great.    I think these concepts also apply on a personal level. For example, Collins discusses the importance of identifying the right course of action (based on an understanding of what you are passionate about, what you are good at, and the economics of the idea) and then, having the discipline to do the right thing AND to not do the wrong thing. Deceptively simple, but having the discipline to not do the wrong thing (i.e., the things that waste time and energy) can be difficult.    Overall, I recommend this book and think it is appropriate for all members (not just the CEO) of any team.

I am too old to be stricken with early onset Alzheimer disease and i found myself feeling terror at times;  just too close.  I recommend this book to every person who has the courage to recognize that we humans all face the possibility of losing the sense of who we think we are or how our family and friends see us.

B00009RDGA|4.0|I don't know if this is a problem with copies other than mine, but the left channel audio cuts in and out periodically, like watching an old film movie where the sound quality is so-so and glitches at the same point as the reel turns, kind of like a scratch in an old vinyl LP record. (I don't have a problem with any other DVDs.)    Unfortunately I waiting too long before discovering the flaw so I'm stuck with it.

0385341008|3.0|A whimsical, literary tale about the love of good friends and books in dark times. The characters are charming, as is the island of Guernsey. I would love to take a trip there some day. Furthermore, it was interesting to read about the impact of WW2 on the lives of the islanders and of their resiliance (and wit) in the face of tragedy.<br /><br />Somehow, when I reached the second half of the book its magic began to lose itself on me a bit. While I wish I could say I loved this book, I ended up just liking it. Perhaps it was the sugary, chick-lit feel that I felt began to dominate the story towards the end...the characters and plot just became too predictable for my taste.<br /><br />All in all, \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie\\" is a good, entertaining read, but don't be suprised if you feel a bit let down when you've finished.

B0000004V2|5.0|This album is so timelessly perfect that it simply could not have been constructed by mere mortals alone.  My theory is that the Roses were practicing one night in a garage, dreaming of glory and stardom.  Lucifer appeared and made a proposal.  He would give them the talent to create some of the most perfect music ever heard, in exchange for their everlasting souls.  The catch is that the talent was fleeting.  After this magnificent album, the dark prince revoked it.  Nothing like this would ever be heard again from the same musicians.  He even went so far as to remove the gift of voice that he had granted to Ian Brown, who is now left partially tone-deaf.  It remains to be seen whether Satan still has title to their souls.  Regardless, this album is in the same league as Eine Kleine Nachtmusic, Abbey Road, and other precious few works of sheer artistic genius.  Unfortunately, it does not share the same recognition as those works, due mainly to the deal with Satan.  However, I believe that future generations will rediscover this album and treasure it as we do now with other classical greats who were ahead of their time.

This is a quick read because you are always wanting to know the next development in these various characters lives. Courage,love and caring are so much more interesting than twisty plot lines and special effects and convoluted language because we don't find them that often-especially in books that make the best seller list. I leave you to read the book to find out where the unusual title came from.

B00004XONN|5.0|When I first heard Radiohead I immediately thought of Pink Floyd, and there is some Floyd in there.  But as music is,  I think of Radiohead as an evolving Pink Floyd.  I just love Kid A.  This CD shows the world what great musicians they are - the percussion, the chords, the keyboards.  Radiohead is very much a fusion band, fused with so many kinds of bands and music. Thom's vocals are great. His vocals are used as an instrument through most of the CD along with great percussion.  I hear Miles Davis in this album and many other influences. There could never be a Radiohead without Thom Yorke but then there could never be a Radiohead without the great musicians that make up this band. They are constantly on a journey and Kid A did not dissappoint me.  How to Disappear Completely is one of my favorite Radiohead tunes. Other great tunes on this cd are, Everything in its Right Place, Optimistic, Morning Bell, Motion Picture Soundtrack. If you are just starting to get into Radiohead, I would not start with this CD.  I would start with OK Computer, then the Bends, then In Rainbows and by then Kid A should sound just great to you.  This CD requires that you adjust your head and ears a little bit(in the open position) before going all the way in.:)

B001PPGAJE|5.0|In the future there is a race of humanoids born whom later when reaching maturehood develop powers and even bizarre appearences on some as they are mutants. However the human race misunderstands them and kind of treats them unfairly, so a powerful good mutant named Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) have formed a school for the gift where young mutants can control their powers and help the benifit of all mankind. However there are some terrorist mutants lead by Magneto (Ian McKellen) who are hellbent on trying to destroy the human race so that mutants can rule over mankind, a runaway mutant girl named Rogue (Anna Paquin) who has the power to absorb lifeforces and energy from other beings including mutants temporarily of course as she runs away from home. She meets up with a Canadian mutant named Wolverine (a.k.a. Logan) (Huge Jackman) but after being attacked by a savage brute named Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) they get rescued by a team of mutants named The X-Men lead by Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Berry) and Jean Grey (Famnke Janssen) where they live in Professor X's school for the gifted to help mankind from the bad mutants such as Magneto's minions like Toad (Ray Park) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijin Stamos) who are planning on mutating the whole human race.<br /><br />An excellent adaptation of the popular comic books from Marvel that started a different trend on superheroes created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Bryan Singer who did the excellent \\"Usual Suspects\\" was born to do these movies except for the third as he really took the comics metaphor on discrimination of different people well to the big screen after years of development hell even with Carolco originally wanting the rights but Fox came to save it. The acting is quite excellent including the action sequences as i love how this Sci-fi movie plays as a movie about racism in the future and how to try to be accepted by mankind.

This book could have be written for me, I have lived with my 2 aging dogs   for over 10 years now, and I often imagine their side of the conversations  I have with them, and their views on this big world in which they live but have little control over, and I am also (amateur) driver.    I have driven Thunderhill many times ... and I can imagine Enzo's bark as he and Denny lap there ...

Though she's a wonderful singer, beautiful Miah Persson can't deliver the demoniac \\"Come scoglio\\" as Cecilia Bartoli masterly does (who can?). And Topi Lehtipuu is not vocally superior to the ardent, italian lyric tenor of Roberto Sacca, and conductor Ivan Fisher does not a clearly better job than Maestro Harnoncourt, and so on, but...<br /><br />But perfect music rendering is not everything in an opera DVD, and this Glyndebourne \\"Cosi\\" has an evident advantage over the Zurich set: visual offering. And I don't mean just the static scenery, but the dramatic flow also. Sets, costumes and lighting tell us that young ladies Fiordiligi and Dorabella live under the blue skies of Ferrara, in a nice house with a nice garden, and plenty of flowers. By some strange reason, these were forbidden issues at the Zurich stage (?). And, perhaps the main strenght of this Glyndenbourne DVD (over many others, not only the Zurich's) is Stage Director Nicholas Hytner, who does a magnificent job with his young singing-artists, driving the plot much closer to the standard of a good stage play than that of an opera.<br /><br />So I'm joining most other reviewers and  I strongly recommend this DVD, as one of the best filmed and well balanced (music and drama) opera productions on the market.
1439102813|5.0|Alice is a 49 year old Harvard professor who has her life together: marriage, career, 3 grown children. She's doing alright for herself. Until she notices she can't remember words and she gets lost on her way home in a neighborhood she's lived in for 25 years. Turns out, Alice as early on-set Alzheimer's.    As story progresses, the reader follows the progression of the disease through Alice's eyes. The reader feels what it might be light to have things they should remember fade, the horror of not recalling loved ones, the humiliation of not being able to preform one's job duties. The reader feels as though they are walking in Alice's shoes and are somewhat trapped in the same hell she is in.    I know some reveiws here state that Lisa Genova gets \\"too clinical,\\" that she includes too much \\"technical\\" writing. Well, there is some of that, in that the author does try to explain the biology of the disease. I suppose some readers want only the emotional aspects of the disease; however, when you are living with some one who has a terminal illness, knowing the technical and clinical aspects of the disease are just as important as the emotional. You want to understand what this is. I was fascinated by Ms. Genova's explanations, as she explained things in simple terms that were easy to understand.    It was interesting to see how Alice's family responds to her illness - in the beginning and over time. Different people handle terminal illness differently, and this was true with the characters of the husband and the 3 children. I know some negative reviews here state they felt everyone was just too happy-happy, smiley-smiley, but I didn't draw that from the book. Again, when you are caretaking some one with a terminal illness, it's not all doom and gloom and walking around with sad faces and teary eyes and a \\"woe is me\\" attitude. When you are around the person, you do try to be upbeat, positive, smiling, happy. It's difficult to be depressed ALL the time.    This story is probably not the perfect reflection of person who is in the first stages of Alzheimer's. And it certainly doesn't tell the story of everyone who is suffering this particular hell. But I could not put this book down and found it well-written and engrossing.
B001GPHFHE|3.0|Bob Dylan. MTV Unplugged.<br />I have to admit that I have mixed feelings about this DVD. It is always nice to see a performance by one of your favorite singers, but rather painful to watch when they are not at their best. On this album, Bob mumbles and sometimes forgets the words to songs that he has sung for years, leaving you to coach him along by using your memory to fill in the words for him. On a few songs, his overtaxed voice starts to fail him, and the band has to carry him along to keep the songs going. The instruments of the other five band members sometimes drown him out completely, and the album has a general feeling of  going through the motions. A flat performance. I tried using both of the DVD's audio settings, PCM Stereo and Dolby  Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, but on a computer with a pair of amplified desktop speakers, there is only so much you can do to improve the sound. I much prefer his early black and white film recordings, when his voice and memory were better, and where it was only Bob, his guitar, and his harmonica...as simple and as close to perfection as it gets. You couldn't reasonably ask for more.
0143038095|4.0|I am way late to reading this book, but I am so glad that I did! The story involves 4 Chinese immigrant women and their 4 American born daughters. The mothers have joined together in a Mah Jong club, which gives the title of the book. They lament the fact their daughters are not as tied to their Chinese culture and heritage as the mothers would like. The daughters feel their mothers don't understand their lives in America.    In this book, we learn the lives the mothers had in China before coming to America, and how that shaped who they are. We also see how the daughters, in living their lives, are shaped by the decisions they are making.    It seems mothers and daughters always have somewhat of a struggle to be understood by each other, no matter the culture, and this book brings forth a common theme. It is well written and so very easy to get swept up in the lives of all of these women. The only problem I had (and hence the 4 stars) was keeping track of which mother was related to which daughter and which story went with which mother. I kept having to refer back in the book to refresh my memory - and I didn't read this book over a long period of time. That was a bit frustrating, but overall the book was a delight.
B001SGEUNI|4.0|I can't say that this is an awesome disc, I do like it, and there are precious few female lead rockers, so this should find it's way into any rockers library.  There are no songs on it that require skipping, at least in my opinion, and there are a few that really stand out.  You could certainly do worse in purchasing a CD, and I do, and have recommended this to others.

It was all because of my Beliefs! I had limiting beliefs at the subconscious level of my mind that changed my biology.. My mind was creating dis-ease!  Ouch!  Still I was overwhelmed with a feeling that I'm in control.  I read his last chapter and learned how to change negative, limiting beliefs with PSYCH-K.  It turned my life around so much that I became a PSYCH-K Instructor and now teach people these tools around the world!<br /><br />I love you Bruce!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was a series that should have NEVER been canceled! The Movie that was finaly released proved that and they should continue with more follow up sequels!! It's a shame they killed half the crew by the end of the movie, but they still have a lot of room for so much. Nathan, Gina, Alan, Ron, Summer, Morena, ALL the cast!!! are the best!!!! I have watched the DVD's now at least 20 times each in the 2 years I have had them, just can't get enough. Joss out did himself, perfect combo of story/theme/cast! A must see and a movie/series that will always leave you hungry for more. They are us! They are what we will become in the best sense of a future for mankind. Down to earth in a sense of the word, real, a SciFi western with humor drama the works! They make you want to be part of Mal's crew!!

Thoroughly enjoyable to play, well illustrated. There were a lot of \\"aha\\" moments for me when the authentic sounds of a 5th or 9th chord replaced my poor substitution chord. Highly recommended. I was not able to put the book down for several days.
B001GM28HO|5.0|It seems that very few years or so some stunning new songstress appears on the pop music scene and manages to command the spotlight. Well, his past year or so I note a Lady Gaga seems to have the attention of all news media. She's been on the cover of Rolling Stone. There have been numerous appearances on TV, and especially on YouTube. In the pop press seems mesmerized. Who is this Lady Gaga and how did she gain such sudden fame?<br /><br />I first heard her music on the XM Radio dance music channel while driving in my car. It really stood out from the general background of mechanical dance selections they play! With only one listen on one song, I knew I had to have her CD album. Why? It's beat heavy, melodic, energetic, catchy and fun; it's my kinda music. It's fun, fun listening! \\"The Fame\\" proved out o be a wonderful album. There's a lot of brains behind the release of this original CD. It's supposedly a debut album, but it really comes across like a Greatest Hits album released after a long and successful career. Every song is a winner and the production is marvelous! The music stands out and away from all other current pop music! Catchy? Jeez Louise!<br /><br />What an assortment of songs! I can't stop listening! This album is a stunning introduction to a sparking new personality. The recording sounds like a crazy concoction mixing electronica, ABBA and Madonna, but it works big time, plus Lady Gaga has her own very distinct voice and persona. I bought the \\"Fame\\" CD, and I'm very satisfied with the entire package. There's not a song I'd delete. If you like to buy individual songs and want to capture the very best tracks, in my opinion you might get MP3s of \\"Just Dance,\\" \\"Love Game,\\" \\"Poker Face,\\" \\"The Fame,\\" \\"Starstruck,\\" \\"Boys Boys Boys,\\" Paper Gangsta\\" and \\"I like it Rough.\\" If pressed for a ranking of the songs, I give \\"Paper Gangsta\\" the top nod and \\"Brown Eyes\\" the bottom, but all of the songs are excellent. The lyrics are humorous and almost frivolous, but that's the way I like this kind of beat-heavy dance music. It's not made for deep thinking; It's just fun, fun, fun! Relax and enjoy!<br /><br />Gary Petersony I like this kind of beat-heavy dance music. It's not made for deep thinking; It's just fun, fun, fun! Relax and enjoy!     Gary Peterson
1416562605|5.0|I am hooked on Aravind Adiga - a new, potent voice in literature.  His awesome comic sensibility elicits laughter at the darkest of situations.  Balram, his hero, if you can call him that, is one of the most complex and exciting characters I've ever met in a novel.  Through him, Adiga deftly throws the reader deep into the huge divide between rich and poor.   Balram's only route out of the destiny of the impoverished is vice, and on some plane of consciousness, I herald him for it.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS A FUN AND VERY ENOYABLE REGARDLESS OF THE AGE OF THE VIEWER
0440237688|5.0|In The Giver, the world is a dystopia where people live apparently in harmony and sameness. The irony in the normalcy is that although there is no war, hatred, or fear, this community is also devoid of feeling, emotion, color or love. People, although polite, are well-trained mechanisms that live each tradition year to year, and each duty day to day that there is almost too much structure and organization. However, because society has been trained so well to their duty, they don't realize this, and go about each day with perfect tranquility and contentment. During the \\"Twelve Year\\", each member of society is given their role, their job; something that the \\"observers\\" believe fits them best. Jonas, the main protagonist, anxiously waits for this day to arrive in December, wondering what role will be chosen for him. When this day arrives, Jonas learns that his new job is that of Receiver of Memory, a rare role chosen only to an honored few. He, like other kids who are twelve, is given his instructions; he meets and is trained by an old man known as The Giver. The Giver, who is current holder of memories, slowly but surely opens Jonas' eyes to many forms of past memories. As Jonas learns more and more about the pain and humanness associated with receiving these memories, he begins to question the way society operates. He becomes cognizant of emotion (pain, happiness, hopefulness, family love) that he cannot express to others, such as his family or friends, and as time wears on, this seems to leave a void in his life. The Giver wants to prepare Jonas for his new role effectively because the last receiver of memories had to be \\"released\\" because she could not accept her role. Jonas, to his horror, begins to find that there are dark secrets about this community his lives in; he wonders if there is a way to change life. Jonas experiences a series of dilemmas, which encompasses the narrative in the book's final part: How can he change this world? What will he do to transferthese memories to the people? Is there anything beyond this world, to the world of Elsewhere? What can he do to break from the restraints of this community?     The Giver, although marketed as a young adult novel, deals with heavy issues, and so, might not be appropriate for younger kids. However, I second the notion (one reviewer had brought this up) that this should be required reading in secondary school. Students complain often about \\"classics\\" as being \\"boring\\" or irrelevant to their world; this is a book that is relevant to them and would probably engage them. Lowry's novel has sophisticated, deep issues (such as our societal response to apathy, the dangers of conformity, the significance of emotion and hope and individuality) and it would profit a younger audience to form their own opinions of the issues.     I had heard so much about this novel, and am glad I finally got around to reading it. Lowry's writing style is quite engaging, as she pulls you in to empathize with the characters and their major conflicts. You find yourself pulling for Jonas as he learns more and more about how different life could be with memories, hope and emotion. He separates himself from the Sameness that the community offers, and tries to find out something deeper. Over all, this is a wonderful book, and I'm looking forward to trying some of the other books in this series, Gathering Blue and The Messenger.     The Giver is a very satisfying read. Definitely Recommended!

B00005JN0T|4.0|I find it a little hard to describe why I like I, Robot so much. I feel drawn to the movie again and again. In a certain fashion, this is typical of the work of Alex Proyas, the director of I, Robot. Alex Proyas is probably best known for directing [[ASIN:B000059XUO The Crow (Miramax/Dimension Collector's Series)]], with Brandon Lee, the ill-fated son of Bruce Lee. The Crow is a cult classic, loved by goths the world over, and its cachet is only increased by the untimely death of Brandon Lee during filming of the movie. Proyas also directed [[ASIN:B0018O4YSQ Dark City (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray]]], a lesser cult film, but a cult film nonetheless, and also one of my favorites. Proyas apparently has a knack for this kind of thing.<br /><br />I like I, Robot, even though in a certain sense I find its premise intrinsically implausible. That is because I am generally a fan of the Lucas-Penrose argument for the impossibility of creating an artificial intelligence by means of a computer algorithm (meaning a Turing machine more generally). Refutations of this argument often verge on the comical, because they are often forced to end up insisting that humans cannot reason, either. Part of the problem here is that Lucas is a philosopher, and many (most?) scientists and mathematicians haven't got any clue what he means by \\"reasoning\\". Reasoning, as he means it, simply cannot be an entirely physical phenomenon, as argued by Aristotle in De Anima. I am on record in public (admittedly a small public) as predicting that A.I. in the strong sense is impossible for precisely this reason.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I have no issue with the kind of robots portrayed in I, Robot, because if machine intelligence is possible, it will be something like what you see in this movie. If you create a machine that can reason, then by necessity it will be able to choose good or evil of its own free will. You just might not like the result.<br /><br />One of the few parts of I, Robot that actually conforms to Asimov's collection of short stories is the Three Laws of Robotics. Asimov created the Three Laws to break the mold of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein on artificial life stories, but Proyas' version of I, Robot restores this fear to the plot.<br /><br />This fear is driven by the truth that logic, like justice, is cruel. None of us really look good in the harsh light of justice; no one can live up to their own principles. Logic is not much better; few of us can follow our principles to their logical conclusions. As Dr. Alfred Lanning says in response to question, \\"Is there a problem with the Three Laws?\\", \\"The Three Laws are perfect.\\" There is only one logical conclusion, and robots, by definition, are logical. Even classical philosophies such as Stoicism would be unable to embrace that blunt conclusion.<br /><br />Asimov actually toyed with this idea himself, as the Zeroth Law of Robotics: A robot may not injure humanity, or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm. This is the same logical deduction made by VIKI, the malevolent mainframe. Thus, it is not surprising that we fear logic, because logic inexorably leads to our collective perdition. The deeper reason for this is that logic itself is incomplete, especially when expressed in natural language. Any mathematics complex enough to include arithmetic must include an unprovable statement, in the sense that it cannot be deduced from within the system itself. Steve Sailer once noted that contracts are written in something like COBOL. The intent of this is to reduce uncertainty about what the contract actually means. Legalese accomplishes this goal fairly well, but you cannot reduce the uncertainty to zero, because words do not possess absolute definitions, a point made by Fr. Stanley Jaki OSB. Any time spent with a lawyer will prove this assertion to your satisfaction.<br /><br />This unsuspected philosophical subtlety surprised and pleased me. Even more so because I, Robot seems like an action movie,and a fine one it is. Shooting killer robots, like shooting zombies, never really gets old.ke shooting zombies, never really gets old.
B00127RAJY|4.0|While the workouts themselves are fine, it's very frustrating that I cannot skip ahead to the workouts without first sitting through introductions and blah, blah, blah (if I try, I receive a message that the function is not allowed on the DVD).  So I'm forced to put in the DVD, start it, then roam off and do something else til all the useless talking is over with.    And the comment that 400lb people can do this (level 1) is probably not true unless they are 25 and in decent shape.  Level 1 is not a beginner workout, so if are over 40 and have not exercised in years, this is probably not a good workout - definitely not if you have health issues.    I'm in my late 40's and while I was never a gym rat, I was active most of my life, and spent several times a week in gyms til I was in my early 30's.  Since then, I've walked daily and exercised regularly.  And, after 3 weeks of 3x weekly level 1 workouts, I still cannot complete it.  I will eventually, but it will take more than a few weeks.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|First I want to say, good job Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen and to all of the cast!!!  Everyday I can watch this movie (I already have almost!).  This is the best version of P&P.  Even though it's somewhat different than the book I still love it.  Joe Wright should make a sequel of Charlotte's and the Bennet girls married lives...especially Elizabeth's (Keira Knightley) and Fitzwilliam Darcy's (Macfadyen).  And to just think if Jane Austen was never born, this movie wouldn't be here or her marvelous books!  Please, you will not be sorry for purchasing this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B0013FSL0C|5.0|I highly recommend this series for those who are students of human nature and enjoy excellent writing, direction and acting. I am once again amazed at HBO's uncanny knack for tackling projects that lift and redefine the television medium. In Treatment is the most accurate portrayal of what happens in the private confines of psychotherapy that has ever been attempted by the large or small screen. The sheer appeal of this show is its unapologetic 'bareness', minimalism and pitch perfect honesty. Gabriel Byrne is understated in his brilliance; Blair Underwood gives perhaps the most sublime and compelling performance of his career; Glynn Turman (not often seen as an accomplished actor i.e. Cooley High, A Different World, etc.) blew me away with his brief but poignant performance; Dianne Wiest - an oscar-winning actress is incredible as the \\"Therapist's Therapist\\".     I have often wondered how anyone had the courage to do such an unadorned project - that is exploring pscychotherapy between 2 people. I think that the answer is that so many of us are secretly hurting and therefore enjoy a safe outlet to vicariously experience such a therapeutic environment. In Treatment delivers this and much more. In Treatment is now 'In Season' in our culture. If you are as fascinated by human nature and relationships as I am (I am a pastor) you will be riveted by this show. Buy the whole DVD series so you can watch it uninterrupted. I found Season 1 to be more riveting than the 2nd season although both are quite good.

0618918248|4.0|I'll try and say some new things about a book that so clearly polarises.<br /><br />Behind the anti-religious rhetoric Richard Dawkins throughout 'The God Delusion'is actually a powerful advocate for the 'moral force' of science: For Dawkins, science reveals the world and creates good for us in the way of advances in modern medicine, technology and inventions.  For the Darwinian Dawkins, the scientific method with its ceaseless emphasis on hypothesis, carefully developed research programs and building theory on the back of independently testable evidence strengthened by peer review shows what comes of an open mind, the power of reason and the willingness to validate ideas by their explanitive power in the real world.<br /><br />By contrast, as Dawkins sees it, religion is inescapably wedded to the teachings of its holy books, its rituals and intellectual traditions, and its propensity to breed closed minds that self-limit inquiry and filter new worldviews.  In other words, in the calculus of creating new ideas and bringing about progress to humankind science wins hands down over religion.  I think this is what lies at the heart of 'The God Delusion'.  Dawkins is passionate about how scientific investigation reveals and explains the wonders of the natural world, and communicates something of what its explanitive power personally feels like for him.  In this I think he is entirely uncontroversial.<br /><br />As a Darwinist Dawkins evaluates religion from the lens of natural selection and offers naturalistic explanations for the origin of religion.  He is entitled to do so as a scientist.  However, such an approach does not capture what religion means or is felt to be by believers.  For the faithful religion is a subjective experience, a turning and submission to God (or other transcendental concept) infused with the powerful emotions of love and kinship He evokes. From this comes deep devotion - As someone brought up in a religious faith I understand the enculturation and communal sharing that brings this 'rapture' about.  And yet, as soon as faith is lost these emotions, this sense of God just as quickly tends to evaporate - something I find truly strange if 'The Creator' really does exist outside ourselves.<br /><br />In the book Dawkins has made the point that many religious people don't know what it is to explain something: I would go further and say that language plays tricks on many people, particularly among many religious believers. It reifies notions such as 'the supernatural' and Aristotlean 'essence', ostensibly placing them on the same level of reality as 'nature' or 'chemical composition'. Just because we know and understand what is meant by 'natural' doesn't mean that by analogy or corollary there must be something as 'supernature'. For something to regarded as real there must be a reliably established pathway of knowledge to it.<br /><br />Religious believers often say that science can - and should - say nothing about the 'supernatural' because by definition science concerns itself with the natural world.  The concept of 'God'- the quintessential example of what is held to be supernatural - is left deliberately vague by believers. They say that His nature cannot be explained because it 'lies beyond human comprehension'.  In this light the term 'supernatural' builds a wall against rational enquiry to leave the 'mystery of the divine' intact. The danger with this approach is that 'God' is simply defined into existence as what he, she or it is desired to be, and that once defined becomes 'reality' in the mind of the faithful.<br /><br />Dawkins makes some obvious points about the Old Testament - its inconsistencies, its all too anthropomorphic God that exhibits all too human - and sometimes pathological traits.  He harps on the power of religion to inspire murderous fanaticism.  And above all he chides the inherent tendency of religion to create in-groups which have the baleful consequence of cultivating tribal animosities.  All of these things thoughtful believers need to confront and accommodate in a wordldview that posits a loving God who cares for humankind - the traditional concern of theodicy.<br /><br />The fundamentalist believer will be affronted by The God Delusion and will often resort to sophistry and intellectual dishonesty to rebut every positive review of it - something sadly all too evident in the comments you will read in these pages, should you care to check.  Such 'anti-reviews' call into question the ethics of their authors and should be a challenge to Amazon in the context of providing value to prospective customers.  Returning to TGD, to those who have an open mind, to those who like to have their views challenged and tested I would recommend this book whole-heartedly.

B0028T6XXY|2.0|I just listened to the Madison Square Garden concert and was impressed but dismayed as well. Impressed by the great sound quality and by his tight band and the great arrangements as well as the song selection. Dismayed by the way he sings, or more accurately the way he enunciates the lyrics. He's got that God's gift of a voice that is SO nice but for some reason he sounds like he has a sore on his tongue or something during this concert. Was he trying to be hip or to create some kind of new vocal hook? Was he trying to sound like a rat-packer in New York? Was he using auto tune? Was he drunk? I don't know but for some reason he pronounces many of his words in a really weird way and it's unpleasant and distracting. When you've got a voice and band as great as he does you should just let them speak (or sing) for themselves. Listen closely, you'll see what I mean. He didn't sound like this on previous albums and whatever he changed for the MSG show, he needs to unchange it or I will cease being a fan.
0790729407|5.0|The story is well told, acted and well balanced.  This is a good film to watch with \\"The Wind that Shakes the Barley\\".  It accurately dislays the civil unrest and feeling about the time period.  It would have been nice to see more of Michael's earlier history as a lad growing up and in London, as it seemed more focused on the 1916 uprising and 1922 treaty with the events surrounding.  Nevertheless, we enjoy this film, and in our opinion was well done.

No Doubt NEW MOON<br />was going to be the pinnacle of ES and it IS the cream of his most accomplished works.<br />It makes my stomach sink with stone when I think of this talent ... gone.<br /><br />Words can't comprehend the reality<br /><br />=============================================================================<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />Facts are this set is the best of all other ES albums.. period<br />Acoustic and stripped..<br />Not the over production on some of his albums...<br /><br />If I had heard anything other than this set I would probably not be the fan I am today..<br />These songs have a feeling to them that is so fragile... Amazing<br /><br />Though both cd's could have fit onto one disc and sold for the same price..<br />The newer \\"From A Basement On The Hill\\" is also in line with the greatness that is on New Moon..<br />I receommend both sets as an introduction to the acoustic perfection of Elliott Smith..<br />If you are into playing acoustic then you will know what I mean..<br /><br />Highly Recommended
B0020MKTOS|2.0|I guess this movie wasn't trying to be funny, but it was a comedy for me none-the-less. After spending an hour of the film trying to convince us what a \\"hard-***\\" he is, Eastwood's character then begins to transform himself into something more \\"PC\\" before his death. Not that I'm in favor of gangs ruling neighborhoods, but let's face it - an army of crusty old white guys with bad prostates and bladder issues running around with guns in old 70's vehicles isn't the solution! I'm guessing the only people that might enjoy this film are seniors rather desperately trying to relive the prime years of their lives.
0307455874|3.0|It was cool but the cover was dirty so I really didn't like that since i got that book as a gift for someone.
B001TN1EBG|5.0|There is such an amazing truth that comes through in each of the songs on this album. The songs are slow paced (not for raving or grinding), but amazingly put together, well written and the tempo perfectly matches the message of each song.  If you are looking for an amazing album, great for relaxing and provoking thought, with a strong and steady male vocal, this album is for you!  I HIGHLY recommend it!
B00003CXB4|5.0|Bought it at a great price. Shipped quickly and got my movie within a few days.
B0028T6XXY|1.0|Michael Bubl&eacute; sings in soulless, emotionless way.... okay, if one includes \\"smugness\\" as an emotion, I suppose, this isn't strictly true.<br />After having listened to this CD for close to a week, I'd have to say that Michael Bubl&eacute; still sounds like an amateur Rat-Pack wannabe, who has learned how to sing a bunch of songs closely associated with Sinatra and his circle and one or two others (like the incredibly camp \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" from Queen). However, his interpretation lack depth, experience and sincerity. He is, essentially, \\"going through the motions\\" on each track. His rapport with the audience is very artificial, too. If he wasn't actually serious about this stuff, one would assume the whole thing was some sort of camp \\"send up\\".<br /><br />When I hear Michael Bubl&eacute; all I can think of is: why would anyone bother with this faux, milksop Rat-Packer when there are so many great recordings by Sinatra, Martin, Bennett and Davis Jr readily available today?<br /><br />I kind of feel that Michael Bubl&eacute; is to the music of this decade what Rick Astley was to the music of the 1980s.
1401923119|5.0|Truly this is not 'new' - but that is not an attach on the author or the book - they deserved full marks (and its a great read) - what is interesting is the fact that this is the discovery of how manifesting works, which was taught by Wattles, Haanel, Edison, Hill, etc wrote about and taught for so many years.    You can understand why/how it works with 'The Biology of Belief', but if you want a set of instructions on how it works just for you to get what you desire - just go back to the source:    [[ASIN:1441487956 Think And Grow Rich: The Personal Study Edition]]  [[ASIN:1441488383 The Master Key System: The Personal Study Edition]]  [[ASIN:1441488359 Path To Prosperity - Mastery Of Destiny - Acres Of Diamonds: The Personal Study Edition]]  [[ASIN:B001OTZOS4 The Science of Getting Rich: The Movie - 2 Disk Set]]
B001PL4HZW|4.0|Every track is awesome to listen to. Just wish that the song Let Me Sign by Rob Pattinson was on the CD.
B001J6GZSU|5.0|...Then this album if for you!  William's soft voice creates a wonderfully relaxing atmosphere.  This CD is absolutely amazing, and if you've got a calm spirit, or looking for a collection of songs to help you slow down and relax on a busy day, then this CD is for you!  I highly recommend it!
B001VEJ2G2|5.0|What can you say about La Roux except this is the start of something special... we'll all be listening to them for years to come.     Clearly influenced by the sounds of the 80's but at the same time fresh and modern and genuine sounding. Great vocal and songwriting abilities across all the album tracks. I can see their songs catching the attention of the industry and predict they'll be penning music for many other artists as well.     Anything else than 5 stars for an album with this many original, brilliantly catchy and heartfelt songs would be underrating the album.    Weak points? That we may have to wait a while before their next album of new music is released since they'll be busy touring and promoting this one. When you hear a debut album from an artist with this much potential you want to hear more to see how they develop and see if it's possible that they can get even better... which would be amazing.    I'm really not a pop music \\"fan\\"... but I am a fan of great music produced by talented artists who \\"feel\\" the music they create... that sums up La Roux perfectly.     This is a special album and I can easily see this winning awards for best new artist and best album of the year.
159562015X|5.0|Easy and quick to read.  An interesting way to learn about your strengths as well as those you work with.  The leadership team now has an idea what they excel in leading to better delegation and happier employees.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This set of DVD's is wonderful. Everyone in the whole family can watch it and it is beautiful and I love the narration .Perfect for family night at home. I bought this as a birthday gift for two 14 year olds and we have been watching it together but it is so good I think I will buy myself the set. It is 4 dvd's and I think about 12 hours of film each segment is about one hour long so you don't have to watch it all at once .
1439102813|4.0|As I am approaching my 70's, and am sometimes forgetful, I truly hope that I am not heading where Alice was headed.  She was successful, married, then seemingly over a very short period of time was lost in the maze of early on set alzheimer's.      Read this for yourself, and to understand others who are lost in the fog through no fault of their own.  Think of your parents, your neighbors, you co workers...they could be right there struggling, suffering through this maze.
B000002TQV|5.0|We can all think of those handful of albums that we consider untouchable, having attained a type of heaven sent status.  \\"The Bends\\" is by far one of the best that ever was!  A masterpiece for certain, not to be compared in any way with the self indulgent crap that Radiohead has been churning out album after album for the past umpteen years!  It's kind of like the \\"Black\\" Album for Metallica where everything thereafter is just sub par.
B0029358HG|5.0|Wow, what a great package.  Nice, thick sleeve with lyrics inside.  \\"Collector\\" high quality LP sleeve plus a printed paper sleeve both included as is the CD in a cardboard sleeve.  It's been a long time since I picked up a new release on vinyl and it was so great to sit and read the lyrics and liner notes and check out the artwork.  If you are a collector or a vinyl junkie you will love this.  As a reminder of how getting a new album on vinyl used to mean a lot more than it is ever possible for a download to mean this is spectacular.  I'm digging it.  One note though... this is a single LP.  Amazon shows it as a 2 LP plus CD set.  I'm going to write to them next, maybe it will have been corrected by the time you read this.  As far as the music goes I'm sure there are already a million reviews for this in the CD section...
0736063684|5.0|This book was and is very helpful in designing workout routines that hit all the major muscle groups. You can compare and contrast exercises to make sure that you are hitting the muscles that you want. Great addition to my library.
B000BAQ8A0|3.0|As a steady JDF fan, I am always impressed with his singing.I also enjoyed his dance steps and comedy. He does not disappoint; however, I can't say the same about the rest of the cast. The production itself is not interesting. I will be looking forward to a Barber with JDF and a more excellent cast in the future, like the current production at Covent Garden (I know it's not being produced for DVD). I hope there'll be one.
B000006TRV|5.0|It's easy to slag Pink Floyd for the mega-dinosaurs they later became, but The Wall was immensely important (just like London Calling, released the same year), not because it symbolized late-70s culture but because it was an open indictment of it.  Whereas London Calling's targets were external, The Wall was internal, a confessional strengthened by the very fragments you criticize, working on levels simultaneously dreamlike and harshly realistic.    The previous generation had (or ignored) Lennon's Plastic Ono Band.  Ours had to scrounge for our truth, finding it in the punk streets of London, NY, and LA... and from one huge rock act that courageously chose to turn in on itself and on its very sustenance, namely the corporate monster that rock had become.    Trent Reznor, Radiohead, MGMT, The Smashing Pumpkins... all of these artists praised the life-changing influence The Wall had on them, and the power of their own work attests to the same.  The Wall was a revelation, largely because it was NOT boringly perfect.    A double-album of psychotic fragments in slick '79.  How radical is that!
B000FC1LOC|4.0|I liked this book but only had one problem with it.  Each chapter is written in first person and each chapter is a different person in the story.  For me this style bounced around too much in trying to keep up with the main story line. Flashbacks occuring before the story picked up again with the reader trying to figure out or remember who was the story teller for that chapter.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|Loved this movie ever since i saw it on the big screen. Its wonderful that they included a digital copy of the movie because I can watch it on my computer.(mac/windows)<br />The audio is truly flawless, but i must admit, I have a 1080i Sony 32\\" and so I cannot view a 1080p, (what blu rays are viewed best on) however I had no complaints with the visual quality of the film.
B001V9LRTM|4.0|We enjoyed this on a 73\\" dlp tv screen.  The sound, even through Sony reciever surround sound wasn't the best.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Warning: Contains minor spoilers for the new motion picture, Star Trek.    I am in love with Spock all over again! Come to think of it, I kind of like Kirk this time around, too!    JJ Abrams and company have done Star Trek justice by making it possible for the sci-fi franchise to tell fresh new stories without trouncing on canon. The fact is, that this movie was the perfect reset button to bring us back to the original Star Trek, but rebooted for new audiences and new stories to tell without losing old Trek fans.    At the center of this drama is Nero (Eric Bana), a renegade Romulan with a mad-on for Ambassador Spock (Leonard Nimoy), whom he blames for destroying Romulus and killing his wife. Sounds a little like Khan, no? It's a little bit like that, but thankfully, there are some major differences.    It turns out that the incident that destroyed Romulus was an accident that creates a black hole, that sucks Nero's ship back in time - making it possible for him to exact the ultimate revenge: destroying the timeline and Vulcan along with it.  Nero destroys the timeline by killing George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth), the father of James Tiberius Kirk, on the day the latter was born. From that point on, while Kirk, Spock, McCoy and other characters we have come to know well have the same basic personality traits, the sequence of events in their lives is altered - for some, considerably.    Though Abrams et al has altered the Trek universe as we have known it, he retains the essence of the relationships and rapport between characters. Chris Pine beautifully plays Kirk as a brash, womanizing rebel without resorting to imitating William Shatner (with one delightful exception)- and yet he is believably Kirk. Karl Urban is pitch perfect and had some of the movie's funniest lines as the acerbic Dr. McCoy. Simon Pegg is hilarious as Montgomery Scott, and Zoe Saldana is luminous as the lingually-talented Uhura.    The standout performance, though, has to be that of Zachary Quinto,who plays the brilliant, conflicted young Spock facing possibly his weakest hour. Quinto, whose interpretation of Spock is somewhat different than Leonard Nimoy's, is both mesmerizing and very sexy as the half-Vulcan, half-human who rejects Vulcan anti-human bigotry, yet struggles to maintain his Vulcan-ness.    While the overall plot of the movie is weak, it is more than made up for by the backstories of the characters and the strength their relationships - even if they aren't what we expect them to be at first. What we get is a vivid, emotionally resonant, and ultimately satisfying movie that is likely to hook new generations of Trek fans.    I've seen it 18 times, and still I can't wait to see it again!
0061767581|5.0|I really liked L.A. Candy! Sure, Lauren writes about what she knows, but she does so with a light and charming touch. The result is a fun, entertaining novel that shows all the machinations going on behind reality shows. Unputdownable, I read it in a few hours! Well done, Lauren!
B001RIY4WE|2.0|The picture and sound are great (as with all blu-ray I've purchased) but the stupid skynet menu system makes my HP laptop blu ray player very angry. I would recommend the non-skynet edition instead of this one for a T2 fan.
B001UREJWM|4.0|I am a hopeless hack at reviewing coherently..so bear with me.  I have listened to this album for 2 weeks as of this review and I like most of it.First let me add that I am a BIG Ronnie James Dio fan.Always have been since I heard the Rainbow Rising album.He has lost some of his upper-mid range and the length he can hold strong notes.But he pushes his voice more here then on other recent projects.The lyrics are also wrote in formula.His cadence was similar on most songs.I thought Toni and Geezer were superb in execution , and contrary to some reviews I thought the riffs very inventive for being so sparce in notes.       A note on Vinny..I love ya man ...just learn some faster fills..ok?     I judge albums on how many songs end up on my mp3...8 for this album. I will list the losers first...     Rock-n-Roll Angel...Just didn't like all of it..loved the opening riff      Neverwhere...Flat..after reading the lyrics I had hope...oh well.     I love all the others for their strengths and weaknesses...but I will deviate from most other reviewers by proclaiming the best song as \\"Follow the Tears\\"..It sticks to you.Overall the album has merit and is a testament to the talent of it's makers.I can't wait until the next one.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|It arrived much earlier then expected in great condition, product works beautifully and the price was great. Well worth it :)

1416914307|4.0|As a newbie to reading novels about vampires, werewolves and demons, this was an extremely enjoyable read.  Not as fabulous as Twilight but much, much better than the Vampire Diaries.
031606792X|5.0|I think that Stephanie Myers did an outstanding job in ending a series that I was so engulfed in.  I could not put this one down!! I am ready to read all four books of the series in Edward's point-of-view now!
B000WS4QJG|4.0|I have always loved the Thriller album.  I was 9 when it was originally released.  I remember well the music, videos, and phenomenon that the entire package generated.  However, these so called remixes for the most part are nothing like the original masterpieces.  Billie Jean and Beat It are the two exceptions.  MJ should have just released a 25th Anniversary disc with the videos and left it alone or maybe had a few more unreleased tracks included.  Only makes me believe even more that a lot of today's \\"popular\\" music suffers greatly.    R.I.P. Michael.  May your musical legacy live forever!
1582701709|4.0|This book will energize your mind. I have personally tried the concepts and amazingly it works! I was skeptical at first but now, I am grateful for what my thoughts are creating for me.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|What a great way to view one of the best movies ever made! I dont buy blu-ray for most movies but the visual difference is crazy with this one, also the extended version was great, I dont know why they cut the 21 extra minutes. Watching the T-1000 melt and get shot and heal was awesome. If you are a fan of this movie this is the only way to view it at home.
031606792X|2.0|Now Twilight has been a guilty pleasure of mine for some time now (even before the movie). I fell in love with Edward and despite the fact that Bella saw no life outside of Edward (anyone else wonder about her life in Phoenix at all?), I was able to love Twilight, New Moon and mostly love Eclipse. Breaking Dawn was one of the biggest disappointments of my reading life. I can accept a Vampire child, in fact it's interesting and there are myths out there about it. I can accept the horrible pregnancy and the Volturi wanting to kill the child. But you have all this tension built up and what does Meyer do? Allow it to fizzle into nothing. There was no fight, no one died, and everyone just lived happily ever after. Horray!    And when Bella and Edward supposedly had sex, I actually turned a few pages back thinking I missed something. Apparently Vampire sex happens so fast that we didn't even get a sentence about it.    Maybe Meyer thought this was a young adult book and there were some things that young adults can't handle. Sex, death, etc. But, I don't think she gave this age group enough credit. These are things that all people deal with.     Also, I'm extremely disappointed that Meyer would allow a leaked portion of Midnight Sun stop her from writing it. I can understand her feeling a violation of privacy and her artists rights but artist make art because they have a vision. I'm sad that she allowed the vision to die because someone was a jerk. I personally didn't read the chapters until she put it on her site and only read it then because I would never get to read the complete novel which is disappointing. Because honestly if I was writing Twilight I would have written it from Edward's prospective in the first place. Bella's life isn't nearly as exciting when Edward is not around.     Anyway, I do recommend the read to a Twilight fan (you need to see how it ends). I'm just sorry the ending was such a cop out.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I was so glad to see how many poor fools expected this to be some hollywood-styled, retardo-superhero movie a la spiderman for the masses and WERE DISAPPOINTED.     Anyone with a brain can appreciate this masterpiece regardless of the length, which really is beside the point. Do you people want to pay to be amused? or to have your brains shot out of your skull in a nightmare only to pleasantly return to a moon-ladden dream utopia?    Yes, it is based on the magnificent novel/comic by Alan Moore.  Yes, they did a magnificent job translating it on film, especially for the time constraints.     This one is most definitely NOT for the kiddies, unless you want them to have a mind of their own and appreciate substance over \\"WOW! special effects!\\" Can't completely ignore the demographics.    There is much more than meets even the novel in this magnificent story about our present age that purposely takes place in the future.    I challenge you to focus through this, if you couldn't, then it wasn't made for you. Simple as that.
B001Q8FRNA|5.0|So there I was, in this record store in the Mission District in San Francisco, wondering whether I wanted to drop some $$$ I probably shouldn't have been blowing in order to get, in essence, one song. Then again, the song was the instrumental \\"Monk Chant,\\" which the monks never recorded in the studio, taken from their appearance on a West German \\"bandstand\\"-type show called \\"Beat-Club.\\" And here it was, on this new reissue of \\"black monk time.\\"    What can I tell ya? When you get the fever, you get the fever. If you've seen the clip of the performance on YouTube or (in pristine form) in the documentary \\"monks: the transatlantic feedback,\\" then you probably have the fever, too, and you can understand why I just had to buy the new reissue of a CD I've had for years. It's just a mad, two-minute, free-form church/jazz organ-meets-primal guitar noise free-for all, and now I can play it whenever I want -- which will probably be often.     And I popped the CD in the deck for the long, thankless drive back to Fresno that night and was in for another bonus. No, not the other heretofore-unreleased track, \\"Pretty Suzanne\\" (an OK song with mad, distorted bass) -- it was the sound quality itself. This cannot be a 1966 recording. This is a 2009 recording masquerading as a '60s garage record. The studio tracks are so pronounced that I didn't know whether I was listening to a brand new album or someone had swapped out my sound system while I was walking around the city. The background is clean, Larry Spangler's church organ is more arcing and punctuating than ever, Roger Johnston's drums are so much more brutally crystal-clear, Dave Day's rhythm banjo rips through the speaker, Eddie Shaw's bass is tremendously, pointedly fuzzy, and Gary Burger's guitar feedback and shouting soar above the rest of the madness in a way that sound equipment couldn't have possibly translated in their heyday.      If you consider yourself a rock'n'roll fan and you're unaware of the monks -- well, you need to become aware and need to hear what you've been missing. They're not only the great lost American rock band (five ex-GIs who stayed in West Germany and recorded this one album for Polydor in '66, broke up in '67 and reunited to play two shows at Cavestomp! in New York in 1999), they're also essentially the first punk band. The Sonics (\\"The Witch\\") predated them musically by about two years, but the monks' sound and image and attitude had the '70s punks beat by a decade. They were the anti-Beatles; when everyone grew their hair long and started wearing colorful threads, they cut their hair short, shaved tonsures into their skulls and wore somber black. When The Beatles and others were singing love songs, the monks were singing \\"I Hate You\\" and \\"Complication\\" and asking \\"Why'd you kill all those kids over there in Vietnam?\\" Gary was playing with feedback about the time Lennon was doing the same, Dave was playing rhythm banjo and Roger was prone to playing with the butt ends of his sticks. And nothing ever sounded or looked like them before or after.    If you're already aware of the monks and have \\"black monk time,\\" you need to reacquaint yourself with it. This pressing/remastering is like having a second chance to enjoy the sensation of listening to a great album for the first time. Plus, I'm assuming the band is getting royalties off this reissue, where they didn't get any off the original re-ishes in the '90s. And the accompanying booklet has tremendous pics. The only two trifling complaints: The booklet print is too damn small and, while each copy of the CD has a collector's card (I have Larry), there has to be a way to collect all nine ...
B000E41MS6|5.0|Love this series.  Have all of the first three sets now.  Can't get enough.  Having the episodes available at any given time is the best since cable doesn't run them enough.
B001HN69AE|5.0|This movie was done really well, don't listen to all the morons who say its bad, they don't know what they're talking about!  The movie was made the way it was because thats what works for an American MOVIE!  Great special effects, alot of money spent on production.  I think its awesome and I'm a DBZ fanatic, sure it could have been a little better in some ways and could have had more fight scenes, but the important thing is it had ENOUGH!  If your a fan and didn't like it I suggest you watch it again and start supporting it so they make a sequal, all the time it took to make a Dragonball movie and nobody is even giving it a fair chance.  I mean what more do you want, it can never be better than the show; we all knew this going in, they have made a movie though so everyone get behind it cause its good!
031606792X|1.0|I loved the first book, absolutely adored it. 'New Moon' and 'Eclipse' weren't quite as good, but I still enjoyed them. And then came THIS book. Ugh! I am sorely dissapointed. I won't give anything away, but it all seems just so.. unbelievable (I know vampires and werewolves are unbelievable enough, but somehow Meyer was able to make it work. This book is almost comical it's so implausible).<br /><br />It seemed like a pathetic attempt to squish all the pieces together. It just doesn't work. My suggestion - if you enjoyed 'Twilight' (a lot or a little) skip 'Breaking Dawn'. You'll be better off. It completely ruins a fabulous start.
B000UAFDP2|1.0|OK, Ive read the reviews and the probs, I currently own a Panasonic BD60 multi-region Bluray and multi-region DVD UK player. I just got Starship Troopers and was amazed to find even with a BD60 it still didnt load!!  same as the rest of you guys.    OK, so I gotta get an SD card right?  my questions are, does there have to be any specific size for the card?  are the cards all the same size to fit the slot?  what size mem SD card do I get?    thanks :)    ps. its VERY poor that Sony dont mention this, VERY POOR.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love this CD. I play it when I exercise and it really helps me get into a serious workout. The music keeps me going full speed.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I can't express how much fun this game is.  It covers my five areas for a great game, Group Interaction, Strategy, Non-repetitive, engaging, and a little bit of chance.  The bonus is the primary goal isn't to destroy or humiliate your opponent, how many games can say that, not Monopoly.      The 4th edition differs with some updated tiles and cards but the biggest improvement is the water tiles are now interlocking meaning a more stable board game.  By now you would have mostly read the review so I just add my vote for best game ever.
B00136RT1I|5.0|Long before the invention of MP3's, I bought Michael Jackson's \\"Dangerous\\" album on audio tape. I loved it. Most critics said Michael's voice sounded \\"strained.\\" \\"Black or White\\" was the first single and music video to ever debut on prime time television on the major networks. After it aired they criticized MJ for grabbing his crouch. They did the same thing to Elvis for shaking his pelvis a few decades earlier. This amazing album continued to release singles for 2 whole years after it debuted, then came the allegations. People stopped buying this album overnight. Now after his death, whenever the media does a story about MJ they always play a song in the background from \\"Dangerous\\" and people are buying it again. I'm glad everyone is rediscovering this really great work of art.
1439157383|5.0|I saw the preview for the movie and thought \\"Oh no way would I put myself through what looks like an emotional roller coaster.\\" Then I saw that it was based on a book and suddenly, I wanted to read it.<br /><br />Because I'm weird like that.<br /><br />So, I read the book knowing about as much as you do after watching the preview... there is a family with a sick daughter and another daughter (younger) who doesn't want to be the organ/blood/tissue/whatever donor for her sister. She gets a lawyer and sues for the right to not have to. Everyone supposedly learns about love and family and sacrifice.<br /><br />The book, thank goodness is a bit more than that.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult weaves the story together with multiple narrators, the suing sister Ana is our main character but we also get the perspective of her parents, her lawyer, her brother, and her court appointed liaison. (We don't get the sick sister's point of view until the end... a choice that is beautiful executed and almost not noticeable.)<br /><br />Along the way we learn about not just Ana, but about her whole family... how everyone is affected by the sickness of Kate.<br /><br />The book is amazingly well written, careful and poetic while being totally believable and charming even as it treads on very shaky emotional ground. This is a story that could lend itself very easily to a caricature of heroes and villains but it manages to make everyone more human than epic.<br /><br />Such is the case of the mother, Sarah, who is very human... very flawed... and even though you want to understand her, even though Picoult gives you all you need to see why she makes the choices she makes... she is never anywhere as sympathetic as Ana. Her obsession, her coldness, her fear is, again, understandable but we never really warm up to her.<br /><br />I will say that maybe having Sarah as a character who we can't wholly get behind helps keep the story focused on Ana... but I would also point out that had Picoult made her more likable, the drama at the end would have been better.<br /><br />This separation that is there though makes the book fraught with tension and also supremely realistic.<br /><br />From a reader's standpoint, it is an easy read as far as words and chapters are concerned but it is a difficult read as you watch a family at the edge of implosion.<br /><br />And then the ending comes along, knocks you on your rear end, and leaves you torn.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book.... With a poetic prose that is clear and yet strangely cryptic, this book will hold you in thrall all the way through.This separation that is there though makes the book fraught with tension and also supremely realistic.

B00005JMJG|5.0|In every script that Charlie Kaufman writes there always seems to be a very twisted mind game as the premise; and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is no exception. Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) and Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) have just gone through a messy break up. Clementine, being rather impulsive (to say the least), undergoes a pseudo medical treatment to erase all memories of Joel Barish, so she can get on with her life. Joel discovers what she has done and opts for the same treatment. Somehow, in sifting through their memories, they rediscover what made them fall in love in the first place. Herein lays the twisted mind game that Kaufman is so fond of. Joel and Clementine must battle the memory erasers to hold onto each other, and the battle royale is all taking place inside Joel's head.<br /><br />Kaufman is aided and abetted here by director Michel Gondry -- a visual genius. He realizes Kaufman's vision with a variety of special effects, like forced perspective and stop action. Nothing computer generated here, it is all done with clever manipulation of the camera. Michel has really brought Charlie's nutso ideas to life, and no matter how far fetched, it all has the gritty look and feel of reality.<br /><br />In a role reversal, you could say that Kate Winslet is playing the Jim Carrey part, while Jim is rather reserved and understated -- the usual sort of Winslet role. Joel, always with three days of stubble on his face, pours his feelings into a diary and whimsical sketches rather than blabbing them out loud. Joel Barish is a projection of Charlie Kaufman, and I can really see him in Jim Carrey's introverted character creation. Who issued the restraining order?<br /><br />There is also a lot of underground cartoonist Robert Crumb in Barish, and some of the scenes where Joel is reliving his childhood could have been lifted directly from Crumb's comic book memoirs. Joel is reading an R. Crumb comic in one scene.<br /><br />-------------<br />Clementine: What are you, NUTS?<br />Joel: It's been suggested.<br />=====================<br /><br />But Joel keeps all his craziness locked inside, whereas Clementine spills it out for all to see. She dyes her hair crazy colors, like Blue Ruin or Agent Orange, and it all matches her clothes -- and the drinks she mixes. She is high maintenance to the max, and she tells him so in no uncertain terms. Soon after meeting she has Joel breaking and entering.<br /><br />---------<br />Clementine: Look, I'm sorry if I came off a little nutso, I'm not really.<br />Joel: That's okay; I really didn't think you were.<br />===================<br /><br />Joel is always very polite and nice, and nice is something that Clementine hates -- or at least she thinks she does, until Joel starts to grow on her. Clementine pushes Joel to experience life to the fullest, to get out of his shell. Clementine has Joel out on thin ice -- figuratively and literally. They are laying together out on the frozen River Charles, a central metaphor of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.<br /><br />------------------------------------<br />Joel: I could die right now, Clem. I'm just... happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be.<br />=============================================<br /><br />Carrey and Winslet make a great team, with Carrey letting Winslet carry the film, while Jim is the anchor. Kate Winslet is spectacular here. I enjoyed her here much more than watching her go down on the Titanic.<br /><br />Also contributing to the success of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind were Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as Stan and Patrick, the technicians who perform the memory erasing procedure; Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the inventor of the technique; and Kirsten Dunst as Mary the receptionist. Stan and Patrick are The Two Stooges of pseudo medical procedures, and Dr. Howard has a suitably reassuring bedside manner -- but you wonder just whose bedside he's been at. \\"Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard. Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard.\\"<br /><br />--------------------<br />Joel: Is there any risk of brain damage?<br />Dr. Howard Mierzwiak: Well, technically speaking, the operation is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.<br />================================<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is also on a par with a night of heavy drinking -- just as much fun but without the hangover, regrets, or DUIs. Though the plot is convoluted, the viewer should have no problem following it. The visual story telling style of director Michel Gondry really pulls you in. Repeated viewings will no doubt reward with additional revelations. Kate Winslet, Jim Carrey, and the rest of the cast really give it their all. It is a very funny film that also has a lot to say about the nature of love, memory, and how much we need each other, even if we are all a little crazy.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />Clementine: You know me, I'm impulsive.<br />Joel: That's what I love about you.<br />==================================================<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001P3SA8K Synecdoche New York]] (2008) (written by Charlie Kaufman)<br />[[ASIN:B001PPLJIQ The Reader]] (2008) ....

0743219619|2.0|I did sort-of like it, but the bouncing back and forth between perspectives got to me this time. I didn't like many of the characters, and came very close to setting the book down. I pushed through, though, mainly to get to the next book in the hope that it would be better. The mystery plotline was ok, but not great - sort of anti-climactic, actually. Eh. Not one of James' better mysteries.

0307387151|5.0|This is, perhaps, the hardest review I've ever tried to write. Atonement is very much three different books: an interior monologue, a survival story, and a tale of redemption. The entire first half of the book is the interior monologue. Reading it reminded me very much of Virginia Woolf:  a wall-of-text of the characters' thoughts and feelings. This is probably my least favorite style of writing, and something I struggle mightily to read. I always find it detached and rather cold. Suffice it to say, the first half of Atonement took me forever to read: about two weeks, consisting of off-and-on attempts to get myself interested once again in the narrative. I completely stopped reading it at one point, convinced I was simply never going to enjoy the book.    After finally working my way through the first half, however, I found myself finishing the rest of the book in a single day's marathon. I simply couldn't put it down. I found myself completely pulled into the narrative and compelled to finish the book as quickly as possible. Stylistically, narratively: everything about the second half changes. And as you get closer to the end, you discover there's actually a reason for that. In fact, there's a reason the first half is written in the manner in which it is as well. Everything in this book is done for a reason, which certainly made me appreciate the first half much more than I ever thought I would as I was reading it.    This is the third McEwan book I've read, after Amsterdam and Black Dogs, and is certainly the best of the three. I highly recommend the book. If you find yourself struggling with it early on as I did, stick with it. It gets much much better.

B000CNESU8|5.0|\\"Network\\" is a satirical look at a fourth broadcast network in the United States in 1976. Those behind the scenes of this fictional network, UBS, have one thing in common: to broadcast the most outrageous programs never seen before to garner high ratings. I am sure those behind \\"Network\\" had no idea how broadcast television in the 2000's would actually mirror their script, what with reality trash talk shows and the advent of FOX. \\"Network\\" is an amazing film and has gone on many Top 10 Lists as being one of the best films ever. In 2007 it was 64th on the list of 100 Greatest American Films of all-time.<br /> \\"Network\\" would win four Academy Awards including Best Actress for Faye Dunaway, Best Actor for Peter Finch who died before the awards were handed out, Best Supporting Actress for Beatrice Straight who only had a little over five minutes of screen time, and Best Screenplay written directly for the screen.<br /> This beautiful two disc set has the film in wonderful widescreen format and has a ton of bonuses including the theatrical trailer, trivia and production notes, audio commentary by director Sidney Lumet, and an informative documentary on the making of the film.

I decided to purchase the cd and very sound is great..Catchy Lyrics, good slow songs, and good good upbeat tempo songs. Does have quiet a bit of cursing for the cd and yes, they do sound like Nickelback back as one other review said, every song is good. I think any song could be a single without the cursing. I think you should buy it, and try it, and you'll see. If this type of music is what you like, you'll like the cd and find yourself rocking out in your car with your windows down and singing along.

I still gave the product a 5/5 because I think this is the best presentation this movie will ever be because of the age of the movie.  It beats the DVD, which is enough to prompt me to buy the Blu-ray. It is also possible that the original film was shot with soft focus.
0385474547|4.0|I read this book during my senior year of college - and some of the images still haunt me. I feel this is one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking stories I have read. The intricacies Mr. Achebe uses are fine threads that don't seem as though they will be able to hold on their own. However, as part of the bigger tapestry of the story, each thread weaves a richer and more beautiful tale. To this day (probably 10 years later), I still find myself asking questions about this story. What if our main character hadn't killed the young boy he had \\"adopted\\" as his son? Would the father have continued to prosper? Or was his downfall inevitable? We never will know the answer to that question. I guess from my Western mindset, I tend to believe that the killing of the young boy - though tragic and senseless - had no direct causal link to what came after. I think the family's fortunes already were beginning to turn; but, the end just was more evident after the murder. However, that is part of the beauty of this book, because it is very different from the classics we have in Western literature. Mr. Achebe's prose is not as polished perhaps as Dickens. His prose differs even more greatly from the Russian masters like Pushkin and Tolstoy. But what might lack in polish is more than made up for in this story of a family unit - so different from what we see - who sees their prosperity and happiness disappear before their eyes.

0061122416|4.0|Rife with spiritual metaphors, this allegorical tale of a Andalusian shepherd searching for his Personal Legend is, for the most part, an affecting fable that allows the reader to extract from it whatever he/she can find that relates to the reader's own search for answers about Life.    I have seen it compared, in other reviews, to THE LITTLE PRINCE and JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL and understand the similarities to THE LITTLE PRINCE but feel that the messages inherent in each of these books are not the same at all; THE LITTLE PRINCE is a cautionary tale for adults about the danger of losing the \\"kid\\" inside, as it will make the adult jaded and focused on material goods, or shall I say, \\"matters of importance.\\"    JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL is definitely a closer match for THE ALCHEMIST. Both deliver tales of a protagonist who searches for that which few ever find. THE ALCHEMIST offers additional themes relating to business and travel and international relations, but in trying to capitalize on the BIG theme of pursuing one's God through self-discovery, Coelho seems to be far more heavy-handed than Richard Bach is (with his singular tale of a seagull as outcast who finds the ultimate in life's meaning).    I liked THE ALCHEMIST very much, but didn't love it like I really wanted to. I think that has less to do with my anticipation than it does with Coelho's didactic tone; I got a sense from the very beginning that I was to absorb this life-altering tale and think, \\"Wow! that was the most meaningful text I have ever read,\\" but I didn't. I feel the intention was pure and truly insightful until Coelho decided to weigh so heavily on the metaphor of alchemy and fulfillment and spirituality.    Perhaps my ultimate disappointment is with the crafting of this novel. It felt too manipulative, as opposed to a simple story that revealed itself to readers by allowing them to make the connection for themselves in a way that is special in a different way for each reader, instead ofhaving Coelho making the connections for us... repeatedly. If a writer has to continually explain the lesson because he/she doesn't trust the reader to find it, he/she, in essence, doesn't beleive in the reader. This is where I think that JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL succeeds more elegantly; though a bit preachy, Bach gets us to discover our own meaning more through the power of the lesson and Jonathan's internalization of it, than Coelho gets from the lecture or over-explaining by the teacher/guide.    But I did like it, especially the ideas presented before the introduction of Alchemy.     As an language arts teacher in the International Baccalaureate program, I am debating whether or not to require my students to read this book, or to make it an option. The reviews from past students reading it are decidedly mixed.
0786838655|5.0|I came across this book looking for a birthday present for my 9 year old brother (I am 23).  I needed a book that can keep MY attention AND my younger brother's.  So I was very apprehensive about this book.  I normally read books by Terry Brooks, R.A Salvatore, \\"adult\\" fantasy writers, so as such I was worried about finding a children's book that would keep my attention, but nonetheless this book actually kept my interest.  Yes the ideas weren't new but what idea IS.  (For those who thought Twilight was such an amazing concept... the idea has been done.... check Charlene Harris' book... only the roles are reversed.... physic girl who \\"falls in love\\" with a vampire whose mind she can't read... sounds familiar?...and Harris' book was out long before Meyers.... though children SHOULD NOT be reading Harris' book... my point is about the idea and the \\"new usage\\")A good writer knows how to use and RECYCLE old ideas (where I feel some writers fail)and I felt Mr. Riordan did a great job in recycling.  My brother loved the book and I enjoyed it.  We will continue on with the series.

B0024F08RO|2.0|Season 1 was incredible. After that, the series went steadily downhill.  I don't know whether they lost the original writers or they just got burned out.  Season 4 is totally lacking in imagination.  It has a small collection of plot elements constantly reshuffled with slight variations.  Pretty soon you realize that anytime there is a scene where Character 1 gets the drop on Character 2, Character 3 will come up from behind and turn the tables by getting the drop on Character 1.  Every one of the good guys will have a family member taken hostage by the bad guys.  Any time a character appears to have been killed in one episode, there is a pretty good chance the next episode will reveal that they narrowly escaped.  The predictability kills the suspense.  And the director continues his annoying habit of trying to show tension by having the actors suddenly start gasping like they just ran a marathon.  Disappointing.

0143039830|5.0|I have read and greatly enjoyed four Paul Auster novels before these: [[ASIN:0312421818 THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS]] (2002), [[ASIN:0312428952 ORACLE NIGHT]] (2004), [[ASIN:0805077146 THE BROOKLYN FOLLIES]] (2005), and [[ASIN:0312428510 MAN IN THE DARK]] (2008). But they are all recent work. Had I started with the three novellas collected here as THE NEW YORK TRILOGY (1985-86), the first fiction published under Auster's own name, I think I would have been intrigued, a bit baffled, and certainly respectful, but probably not eagerly waiting for his next book as I am now. In the trilogy, Auster uses the device of the pulp-fiction detective story as a means of exploring deeper issues about identity and the Faustian bargains inherent in writing fiction. The approach works best, I think, where there is a balance between the popular medium and the serious message; the new Penguin Classics Deluxe edition with wonderful faux-distressed covers and title pages by Art Spiegelman plays so perfectly into the pulp genre that the fun carries the reader quite far into some of the more abstract passages -- far, but not all the way.<br /><br />All the later Auster novels that I have read involve a central character, usually but not always a writer, who engages in some kind of search for meaning, involving himself in stories of one kind and another: dreams, memories, fantasies, or movie scenarios. A story-writer finding clarity by means of other stories -- no wonder Auster's work is often referred to as metafiction. But no cause for alarm; Auster is such a fabulous storyteller that even his slightest diversion becomes a delight. If his framing characters are sympathetic, as they mostly are in his later work, and their situation is believable, Auster's novels work perfectly on several levels simultaneously. But in the first two books at least in TRILOGY, he seems more interested in writing a novel of ideas, rather than giving those ideas a human handle.<br /><br />All three books take place in New York, but only the first, CITY OF GLASS, is in any real sense tied to its setting. The protagonist here is another writer, Daniel Quinn, but he does not stick to that name. He has begun to think of himself as William Wilson, the pseudonym under which he writes detective stories, and when he receives a series of late night phone calls asking his help as head of the Paul Auster Detective Agency, he impersonates the unknown Auster. He sets off on a long surveillance of a madman who spends his days wandering the streets of the Upper West Side. Receiving little help from the real Paul Auster (whom he contacts later at his real address and meets his real wife and child), Quinn/Wilson must continue his search alone, finding a kind of spiritual nirvana even as his material existence deteriorates. It is a novel of interesting ideas, though carried by an unreal plot.<br /><br />The middle novella, GHOSTS, is the most abstract and the least enjoyable. Again, it involves a private detective. This is Blue, engaged by a mysterious Mr. White to watch an equally mysterious man called Black, who lives in a Brooklyn apartment opposite the one that White has rented for Blue. Black appears to be some kind of writer, and most of the book consists of Blue watching Black write, while himself keeping notes on what he imagines Black might be writing. Of the three, this relates most clearly to the nature of fiction, but so artificial a concept can barely sustain even the 60 pages of its length.<br /><br />However I really enjoyed the third novella, THE LOCKED ROOM, because its container story comes closest to being able to stand on its own. The central character, presumably Auster himself, finds himself appointed the literary executor of his childhood friend, Fanshawe, who has disappeared. He publishes Fanshawe's work, falls in love with his wife, and adopts his son, in a sequence of short chapters that sweeps the reader up in its romance. But the process makes him begin to doubt hisown abilities and even his own identity as a person, leading him further and further from where he started. Although his situation is somewhat melodramatic, his feelings, whether as a man or artist, are all too real.<br /><br />Many times I was reminded of a childhood favorite, G. K. Chesterton's detective fantasy nightmare [[ASIN:0375757910 THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY]]. If you enjoyed that, you will like the TRILOGY, and vice-versa. Otherwise, I would advise readers new to Auster to start with THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS or ORACLE NIGHT.dentity as a person, leading him further and further from where he started.

1428156585|5.0|1.  I'm glad that amazon has a separate review catetory for this book; the audiobook version, because I think it is different.  Unlike most audiobooks, this one has the author reading the book and which is a positive thing.  Initially, when I first started listening to it, it was a little hard to understand the author's english, but within a chapter or two, my brain because used to her english--> no problems and again--> in the end it was a very positive factor in that I felt even more aware of the author and her struggles etc...<br /><br />2.  In regards to more important things--> ie the content of the book, the bottomline is that this is an incredible story about a truely heroic person, who has the amazing ability to simply discern and more importantly articulate the truth.  In this day and age, there are not many people who truely inspire me, but the author is a rare breed--> someone who is intelligent, someone who is geniune, and someone who is able to clearly articulate the truth and who actually has the courage to do so.<br /><br />3.  1000% highly recommended to all human beings... if they can handle the truth.
0451169514|4.0|I've got to say, this is by far the creepiest book of King's I have read thus far. I would not consider myself an expert on his library, but this book certainly delivered the goods. I'm not going to lie there were parts of the book that kind of dragged in spots, but overall it was a fun read. In fact the Derry Interludes were probably the best parts, and certainly did their job in building the intenstiy. As I've said I've only read 4 King books the other being The Stand, Salem's Lot and Needful Things, but this by far was the best of the batch so far. Right now I'm needing a little break from King, but when I return I'm thinking The Shining will be next.

0736063684|4.0|You aren't likely to find a better basic guide to strength training and which exercises do what. It also goes into very superficial detail about what certain muscles do and how to train them.    Unfortunately, in going for a simple approach, the author glosses over a lot of important details relevant to building a strength training program. Some exercises' functions aren't adequately explained or have critical aspects ignored. A lot of common weight machines or machine configurations aren't discussed either.    In short, it's a great book to kick off learning about strength training. However, it should be accompanied by a book that fully discusses the construction of a weight lifting routine and appropriately covers the concerns with each type of lifting.
B00005QGAT|5.0|While it isn't the true first album by the late, great Michael Jackson, in my eyes, I consider OFF THE WALL to be the \\"beginnings\\" of a legendary artist. Often overshadowed by the success and undeniable greatness of THRILLER, I consider OFF THE WALL to be equally as great. Sure it was THRILLER that really broke MJ through as a solo artist and established his genius, OFF THE WALL served as the starting point, the \\"diving board\\" if you will for MJ's success.  The classics that are featured on this perfect \\"debut\\" (ignoring Michael's earlier, less successful Motown releases such as FOREVER MICHAEL, etc) are as timeless as all of MJ's music and shall never be forgotten. The word that sums of OFF THE WALL the best is \\"masterpiece\\".<br /><br />The album opens with the brilliant \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\", one of my very favorite Michael Jackson songs. The lush orchestrations overseen by master composer and producer Quincy Jones are immaculate, and MJ's vocals are pitch-perfect.  This song is the epitome of what R&B sounded like at the tail-end of the disco era, yet this up-tempo dance jam doesn't sound the least bit dated.<br /><br />\\"Rock With You\\" is definitely a Michael Jackson tune that is close to my heart. The songwriting is perfect and the production with the orchestrated brass coupled with the funky sounding groove is just indescribable to say the least.  Michael is also one of the few people I have ever heard sing \\"Rock With You\\" truly competently. Sure, it is his song, but sometimes \\"copy cats\\" can get away and sing a song with justice and deference to the performer.  In the case of \\"Rock With You\\", there will only be one who can truly captivate it and that is none other than MJ.<br /><br />\\"Workin' Day & Night\\" isn't given nearly enough credit, which is unfortunate considering it is a solid and as enjoyable as any other track from OFF THE WALL.  The production is incredibly funky and Michael Jackson shows off incredible swagger on this sexy, up-tempo number. Similarly, \\"Get On The Floor\\" is overshadowed by tracks such as \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\" or \\"Rock With You\\". \\"Get On The Floor\\" is one great, post-disco soul track, intact with strings, funky bass, and a standard, rocking R&B drum groove.<br /><br />Jackson instantly heightens up the soul and funk factor even more on the title track \\"Off The Wall\\", which features some of the best production of the album.  Again, the songwriting is immaculate and MJ as always is in his zone.  His falsetto is flawless.  \\"Girlfriend\\" also gets overshadowed by the \\"bigger hits\\" of OFF THE WALL, however it also has a classicism that not many of today's R&B numbers could dare rival.<br /><br />\\"She's Out of My Life\\" is an incredibly, sensitive ballad, something that MJ was incredibly great at pulling off.  Many artists that revolve more to dance-based pop/R&B fail miserably at ballads.  MJ embraced them and sang them as well or better than his more dance-based numbers.  \\"She's Out Of My Life\\" is one of the most beautiful, touching, and sincere songs ever written.<br /><br />\\"I Can't Help It\\" is a soulful as all else on OFF THE WALL and serves as a mid-tempo ballad.  Here Michael Jackson's vocal nuances are untouchable - they are just that great.  \\"It's The Falling In Love\\"  showcases more smooth R&B vocals from the King of Pop, over rhythmic drums and a smooth soul arrangement.<br /><br />The original album ends with \\"Burn This Disco Out\\", a brilliant funk-R&B tune intact with a sick groove, thick bass line, and a funky horn section. Here Michael Jackson sounds among the best of the entire album (and it is hard to discriminate here).  It is a perfect closer to a perfect R&B album.  1979? This album could be a hit in 2009!!!<br /><br />The SPECIAL EDITION additionally features extra interviews, demo versions of a couple of tracks (\\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\", \\"Workin' Day And Night\\").  Essentially, what can be said about one of the very best albums of our time? It's a clear-cut masterpiece and will always remain so. 5 stars.

B0028SVXR6|4.0|One thing that's for sure concerning the Mars Volta's fifth studio album OCTAHEDRON is that it is their quietest, most conservative effort to date.  Being a super-fan of the group, when I first played OCTAHEDRON, all the way through, I couldn't help to think to myself is this really The Mars Volta or is this some kind of joke.  After a couple of spins, I began to discover the logic and beauty of The Mars Volta's most commercial effort to date.<br /><br />\\"Since We've Been Wrong\\" certainly doesn't rock hard (at least to the end), but turns out to be a very beautifully composed, Mars Volta number.  The most tender, and perhaps most sincere ballad that the Volta have ever recorded, I think that fans of the group will eventually grow to love it.  Sure, it's certainly no \\"Wax Simulacra\\" or \\"Goliath\\" from the raucous, manic, brilliant BEDLAM IN GOLIATH , but it is another great Volta track.<br /><br />\\"Teflon\\" resurrects some of the experimental nature of the Mars Volta that seems absent from this album.  Still, it pales in comparison to anything on FRANCES THE MUTE or THE BEDLAM IN GOLIATH.  Despite this, it is still strong in my eyes, if a bit tamer than I'd expect from my favorite band. Still, a plethora of sounds at the end of the track remind  us that this is the Mars Volta.<br /><br />\\"Halo Of Nembutals\\" opens up with a plethora of sounds, not dissimilar to  previous Mars Volta tracks.  Another solid track, it doesn't possess the same luster of better Volta tracks, which seems to be the trend of OCTAHEDRON. Still, one must ask, could the Mars Volta ever produce an album that was horrible? Its a rhetorical question, and the answer is NO.<br /><br />\\"With Twilight As My Guide\\" is another sensitive, more acoustic driven number (as far as guitar is concerned), though it possesses more authenticity than \\"Teflon\\" or \\"Halo Of Nembutals\\" in my eyes.  \\"With Twilight As My Guide\\" is a more haunting, infectious ballad by the Volta, and is my personal favorite of OCTAHEDRON.  Does it rock? No, but the Volta pull off the \\"sensitive\\" thing on this very well written and orchestrated track.  Would I put it up against \\"Goliath\\"? No, but it is among the best of this album.<br /><br />\\"Cotopaxi\\" sounds more like it could've appeared on previous Mars Volta albums, hence redirecting the Volta back to what they know.  Again, the Volta resurrect the odd, non-standard time signatures that made them famous (well popular) among their fans.  \\"Desperate Graves\\" takes a little bit to warm up, but when it does with its infectious hook it proves to be another solid Volta track.  The harmonies are lovely and the varying timbres achieved by the band as always are immaculate.  It still doesn't \\"stand out\\" more than the Volta's previous works, but it doesn't take away from their previous works either.<br /><br />\\"Copernicus\\" is solid, but not my favorite of OCTAHEDRON.  The simplicity is both appreciated and annoying at the same time just because you don't expect such a reserved track from the Mars Volta.  Sure, I'm repeating myself, but I can't emphasize enough how surprising this album is.  \\"Copernicus\\" does attain more depth as electronic drums pervade the once simple ballad. Still, the dynamic levels remain reserved, much like the folk music that band Yes dabbled in in the 1970s. Final track \\"Luciforms\\" is an interesting listen with dramatic harmonies and interesting sound combinations. It is proves to be a solid way to end a solid, if surprising Mars Volta album.<br /><br />Honestly, this is probably my least favorite Volta album.  It isn't what I expected upon buying, but it still gives me \\"thrills\\" if quieter ones.  If you are a person who likes prog-metal but doesn't like the extreme side, this would be the perfect album.  If you are a person who has heard about how great the Mars Volta are, then I don't recommend you start with OCTAHEDRON.

B0000025DV|4.0|Please indulge me for one minute.<br /><br />I really need to take exception to the ongoing notion that in 1977 punk unceremoniously barged in and supplanted the old guard bands like Tull, Yes, ELO and all the others. True, punk made a noticeable impression in London and New York and possibly L.A. But the US at large missed out on the entire punk wave of '77 and '78. Some college radio stations played it but certainly precious few (if any) US mainstream radio stations dared play Ramones, Sex Pistols, et.al. The false refrain that punk ruled and disposed of album rock in 1977 is getting tired, repeated ad nauseam by both noted music journalists on AMG and Rolling Stone (who ought to know better) and do-it-yourself-ers on Amazon and elsewhere. I guess they feel they are hip and \\"in the know\\" when citing even false information. Unbeknownst to many, there exists a considerable world outside of London and New York. A world that functioned just fine without the edict stating that punk will turn your music world upside down. Sure, most large cities had a burgeoning punk movement but it didn't happen simultaneously (in 1977). It took a couple of years to germinate and grow and didn't have a measurable impact on the pop music of the time in the US. Just look at the reprehensible music charts of the time. Punk simply wasn't there. I wish otherwise. Please don't cite Elvis Costello or Blondie. Elvis was no punk; an acerbic, gifted, new voice in the rock/singer-songwriter mold but certainly not a punk. If Blondie were punks then they were the lamest of all. Most US music fans in 1977 didn't even know what punk was and maybe could name one or two bands. There just wasn't this purported onslaught of punk rock in the US as urban legend tells us. Disco was the real culprit here in the US. Many top rock artists suffered or fell due to the preponderance of disco in the pop and sales charts and their flawed notion that they must therefore forfeit integrity and alter their sound accordingly.<br /><br />ELO was one of the few groups that used it artistically and to their advantage. While they weren't a full-fledged disco band Jeff Lynne certainly was influenced by this change in the musical landscape. As early as 1975 he abandoned much of the formula that made ELDORADO such a delightful and groundbreaking album in favor of a more pop and, yes, disco-flavored sound. I don't hold this release (OUT OF THE BLUE) as near and dear as many ELO fans. The AM and FM hits were numerous and relentless. I didn't get this CD to hear 'Turn to Stone,' 'It's Over,' 'Sweet Talking Woman,' 'Night in the City,' 'Birmingham Blues' or 'Mr. Blue Sky' even though I find a couple of those quite tolerable today. With 17 tracks I'd hoped that there were a few gems that were neglected due to the constant hammering of the hits back in the late 70s. I never owned this album until now but I certainly heard it many times on 8-track in Nova SS and Trans-Am autos as well as on LP at house parties and college dorms in those days.<br /><br />My hunch proved right. There are many other nice pieces on this album. The first one that jumps out at my is 'Jungle' with it's propulsive rhythm and irresistible melody. The nonsensical refrain is a bit silly but so what. Remember Doo-Wop, anyone? 'Standing in the Rain' is a tasty medium tempo rocker in the classic ELO mold, once the lengthy intro expires. The slow tempo 'Big Wheels' is another melodic winner replete with the swirling string section synonymous with ELO. 'Summer and Lightening' and 'Sweet is the Night' are two more enjoyable album tracks. Actually, this entire album is quite nice, hits or otherwise. I didn't buy it for the hits and am pleased to say that this album would hold its own as a 12 track album, not including any of the best-known songs.<br /><br />And that is the criteria for a truly solid album. Take away the hits and what's left?ELO was one of the few groups that used it artistically and to their advantage.

B000LXHK2C|3.0|After reading the reviews for this movie on Amazon, I was somewhat disappointed when I finally got to watch it.  The movie is mediocre, and moves along slowly.  A lot of issues are never addressed that come up in the movie, and most of it is forgotten when Russell Crowe's character gets the girl.       All in all this movie is better to rent or borrow from the libary than purchase unless you're a die-hard fan of one of the actors.  There are some pretty views of the French countryside, but having been to France, there are more picturesque towns without hugh chateaus.
B000W7FDBM|5.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) introduces audiences to the imaginative world created by JK Rowling through the eyes of Hollywood filmmakers, and it is truly fantastic!     The story presented in the book is timeless, but what makes the Harry Potter series so appealing (in my opinion) is how cleverly Rowling describes Hogwarts and the rest of the magical world. It translates wonderfully to the big screen and really brings the book to life.    Speaking of the book, the film is quite faithful to the original story. I think that it is the most accurate of any film in the series to date. Although staying strictly by the book doesn't guarantee a great movie, this film has no problems.     It stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, respectively. Their acting isn't quite brilliant, but they are cute in the roles. Other actors such as Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, and Alan Rickman have supporting roles.     The first Harry Potter film is splendid entertainment! 5 stars.
B0029358GM|1.0|Wilco was well on their way to establishing themselves as a truly great band. Their first four albums were all great! They followed up the Uncle Tupelo sound, but deviated slightly from the country alt sound and that was OK. I have never felt that Jeff needed to keep doing Uncle Tupelo, he should be allowed to evolve and grow. However, I questioned where that growth was going with \\"A Ghost is Born,\\" an album that had an equal number of hits and misses. Then came \\"Sky Blue Sky,\\" an album that had a lot more misses than hits. The problem with both of those albums was just an overall lack of energy or excitement. For the most part, they were dull albums. Yeah, yeah, they are a mid-tempo band, I have heard that. But something seemed to be missing. Now, some have argued that Jay Bennett had a stronger voice in Wilco than Tweedy would have you believe. That does have some credibility now, considering the fact that Jay's two albums with Wilco were great and the albums released after his departure were lacking. That is neither here nor there. Now we get \\"Wilco\\" the album. The terms syrupy, bubble-gum, cotton candy and crap come to mind. Look, I know I am going to get flamed by Wilco kool-aid drinkers in here, but I don't care. I am not one of these blind loyalists. Wilco's music is declining into an almost unbearable state. I still listen to the first four albums all of the time and always will, but it sure seems that this band has nothing new left to offer. The songs are no innovative, they are not interesting and they are about as deep as shot glass. If another band not named Wilco had released this album, I guarantee you that half of the people in here that profess to love it, would say it was not a very good band. I am hoping that Jeff will get it back somewhere down the road, but I am losing faith.
B000W746GK|5.0|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) is an excellent follow-up to a great film. It's fun and more entertaining than the original!    The film stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint (whose voices have lowered since the last film) and Emma Watson. Many familiar characters return and a handful of new ones appear for the first time. Kenneth Branagh is especially funny as the egotistical Professor Lockhart.     The story continues and is more engaging. However, it still maintains the familiar atmosphere of the first film. It is very good entertainment! 5 stars.

This DVD documents the band's return to the music of the mid 80's and their most popular era with a remake of the POWERSLAVE TOUR (w/music from Seventh Son). The documentary was nice, nothing too insightful, but the 2nd disc is the true gem here. The concert and band's live performance reveal why Maiden is the best metal band around. The live performances are great and Dickenson's voice is as good as ever. You won't be disappointed!

And it still is only decent enough to warrant rare dust-offs for some deeper songwriting licks in between lifeless rock routines, on a production encroaching geezerdom that only really seems to accentuate properly during slower ballads and instrumental passages.
0439023483|3.0|You've got to hand it to Collins: No one can plot a fantasy novel like her. Nobody. She has you not from the first page or the first graf, but the first *word*. She creates believable, likable and riveting characters, ridiculously addictive survival scenarios and a rich world to boot. If you aren't up until 4 a.m. finishing this thing, you're a corpse.     My only problem with this novel also happens to be a very big problem: the overall premise. I'm not spoiling anything by mentioning that the plot involves kids pitted against each other in a giant outdoor slugfest to the death. Again: Kids pitted against each other in a fight to the death. Oh, and it's all on TV. Everyone in this post-apocalyptic world either thinks that's neat, or throws up his or her hands and figures there's nothing that can be done about it.     The author explains this away by creating a world of poverty and hunger; the parents of the young gladiators are so beaten down and afraid of the totalitarian regime that they just hug their kids and shut up and pray, but -- and this is just my opinion -- that's not an effective enough mechanism. It simply doesn't jibe with human nature. Even the starving, terrorized parents of child soldiers in Africa have been known to drag themselves into the bush and track their kids down or die trying. As much as I loved everything else about this book, I can't get past the basic setup. Isn't there one parent out there, one crazy uncle or scrappy rebellious mom, who'd stand up and protest at this amazingly cruel custom? There's not a single voice among the privileged rich in Capital City who might kick up a fuss? I know we're talking about a cruel dictatorship -- and an all-powerful one, at that -- but parental bonds have been known to be very strong things, and I think the author could have done a better job selling us on why the barbarism continues.
B0000009SY|3.0|3 1/2    Zappa is one of those rare artists that can be forgiven for even the most impulsive (and repulsive) indulgences because of all the other tools this mechanic readily works with. This double can often feel like a trek for talent, and the running narrative does little to encourage repeated listens,  but when the music takes unexpectedly (and often) tremendous turns into progressively composed, virtuoso territory you always remember why this purveyor of perverse is celebrated with a complete straight face.

It offers great conversational topics, and touches on racism, hypocrisy on both sides of the aisle, poverty and sexuality.  There are many undertones, and offers segways to current news. You have to be quick and updated on the latest news to catch the hidden messages.      The only downside of it would be the explicit sexual content.
B0026BD2GK|5.0|Clearly Santana was at his prime live here and to me there is no reason not to compare this to any live performance of Miles' from the \\"On the Corner\\" era until 1975. However, just like Miles this is not a series of unfocused jams but has a clearly controlled quality but to me is closer to fusion than rock (although yes this album clearly was listening material for the Mars Volta). Woodstock itself for those that can remember it (that would include audience members) when one listens to the full sets has some that have lessened over the years as Jefferson Airplane were past their prime as sadly was Jimi Hendrix (and he himself noted that the Woodstock performance was lacking, a far better official starting concert is \\"Live at Monterey\\"). Carlos Santana had however, clearly entered his musical prime (which he would remain at for a while) and live the experience is even better, taking the direction the Grateful Dead never really acheived (enjoy their music or not, there is not a stray moment here, this is focused realized material and with a similar rhythm section to Miles mid 70's bands, clearly the two were co-inspiring each other). Although not one of the more historically noted moments at Woodstock this was one its most inspired performances and for a band that wasn't performing a closing act but just becoming noted musically.

He sounds great and jokes around a bit.  He is so talented, and such a character at the same time!  My girls, ages 8,13 and 14 also love watching this- they say he is funny.  He performs on a beatiful stage and the lighting is awesome.  Unfortunately, I don't have a blue ray, and accidently bought this by mistake, so I had to buy the regular DVD...

B0027G783W|4.0|That Moby is a genius, in terms of overall musicality and production ability, has never seriously  been in question, and his talents are vividly displayed here. This low-key but often intensely emotional effort does take multiple listens to truly appreciate, so casual fans who love Moby for his dance grooves may be somewhat perplexed at first. It's kind of like crossing Bowie's \\"Low\\" period with John Lennon's \\"Plastic Ono Band,\\" but filtered through Moby's unique sensibilities. Kudos for casting commercial concerns aside and taking a real chance. Actually, the track \\"Mistake\\" could easily be a modern rock hit, and \\"Pale Horses\\" (w/ heartbreakingly gorgeous female vocals) would be perfect for chillin' on the dance floor after working up a sweat to the man's \\"Next Is the E.\\" Let's hope radio programmers take a chance as well.
B00204AA0O|4.0|I own both Soviet Kitsch and Begin to Hope, both of which are spectacular, with just a few songs I'm not crazy about and just ONE song (\\"Edit\\" from the album Begin to Hope) that I always skip.    In short, marvelously talented with few songs you won't like.    Far has been much of the same.    The first 5 songs are just plain stunning. Quirky with stellar melodies and deeply personal, intimate lyrics. Then comes what I think is the most bland of all the songs on this album, Laughing With, which strikes me not only as being bland, but preachy and self-righteous. Kind of an odd one for her, but I always assume that Regina is experimenting, which is a large reason for why I love her so much.    She takes chances.    Sometimes she faceplants, but when she succeeds, she really flies.    After the short \\"talent intermission\\" with Laughing With, she gets right back to it with 4 more tracks of awesome.    I'm not crazy about Wallet or One More Time With Feeling, but they're not bad either. Then she ends with Man of a Thousand Faces which I'm still getting to know.    One thing you should keep in mind when it comes to Regina's music is this:    This is honestly a musician that puts a lot of herself into her art. Not only that, but she puts a lot of thought into her lyrics, into the experience the songs provide and into the overall \\"shape\\" of the album, how each song moves into the other.    What this means is that although some songs may not strike you at first, they may very well grow on you over time. That's what happened for me while listening to a number of songs on her previous albums. I could see myself going from \\"meh\\" to \\"wow\\" over time.    Not a lot of musicians can do that.    This is a continuation of the depth she has displayed in previous albums.    Absolutely recommended!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian is quickly becoming my favorite author!  Hope to see more from her!  Her stories are not for the faint of heart.

B000W93CXQ|4.0|i really enjoyed reading this book. at times it felt like the tapes would go on for too long. the emotions in this book were overwhelming and brought a tear to my eye every once in a while. when the book started, i didnt know what to expect. i had no idea what the tapes were going to be about. when i first started to read it, i expected the tapes to be kind of creepy ,which they were in a way, but they did prove a point. the one downside with this book is that i believe that hannah was overreacting to some of 5the incidents . they could have been worse. the last downside woud be that there was a plethora of names to remember . overall though, it was a very well written book.
B00127RAJY|4.0|All you need for these work outs are hand weights and a mat if you are working out on a hard surface.  The work outs are intense and that can be a turn off for someone who is just starting out.  But if you are serious about getting results this is one of the tools you need.  Pace yourself and don't be too anxious to move from workout one to another level until you are 100% sure that you are comfortable with all the workouts.  Also don't expect to see weight flying off.  You need to work for it.

B0015XAT3Y|2.0|I am not rating the album......Out of the Blue was a fantastic album in 1977 and it still is in 2009.<br /><br />But this re-master is grossly lacking in any significant degree in audiophile improvement......to the contrary....I think it sounds noticeably worse than the original release of the CD I bought \\"way back when\\" (Jet Catalog # ZDK 35530).  This release sounds \\"tinty\\" and as someone said earlier, no low end.  This surprises me given it's the 21st century ! ! !<br /><br />The Jet release also had a 28 page booklet (all the lyrics included, like the LP did).....though this one does have more narrative from Lynne and an interview.<br /><br />I would agree with an earlier review that there is some historical improvement with the addition of \\"3\\" tracks....though they can hardly be called that.....one is like 24 seconds long !<br /><br />You can no longer get the Jet release, I'm sure.....so this is your only chance at owning this piece of music history.....but for those of us who have been ELO fans for more than 30 years, this is a disappointment....certainly not an improvement.  Just a good thing it's only $6.99.........for musical content, it grossly under-priced.....for sound quality it's about $3 too much.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|if you have a cat(s) who tracks a little of the kitty litter out of its box, this is what you need for picking it up.    if you get small piece of leaves etc. tracked in your house, this is what you need.    it is not a vacuum cleaner, and not made for big jobs.  but when you want to do some quick, light clean up, it is great.
6300273199|5.0|Saw this in a theater at midnight when it was released.  Had a mono  copy of it on beta.  Now have a decent copy of it on VHS.  Soundtrack  from these shows are remastered for the \\"Bonfire\\" box set.  They need  to put this video with the soundtrack and put out a DVD already.  The  back cover shows a picture taken in the 80's with Brian Johnson but the  video is of a show with Bon Scott as singer.  If you are a fan of either  the singer or the music, this is a great video.   No Bluray, no 12.1  surround sound.  Just release a DVD with a soundtrack on par with the  \\"If You Want Blood You Got It\\" release.  Do not be confused with the  multi-disk release with the same title.  I don't think any of this  footage is in that.

B00005O3VC|5.0|This has got to be the funniest movie I ever saw.  There are so many classic scenes and lines that come from this movie that if you still haven't seen it yet and are wondering if you should, then yes, you should.  You will be missing out on a great masterpiece.      This review is for the movie and not the various re-relased DVD versions.  Personally, my opinion is that there should be at most one special edition DVD.  Anything more than that is ripping off fans.
0061854549|4.0|My husband and I both read this book and both of us greatly enjoyed it.  It is easy enough to be classified, in our opinion, as \\"beach\\" reading.  It is interesting and makes you think about your own decision-making processes in ordinary circumstances, like in restaurants.  It also has over-arching implications for issues such as corruption and cheating in business and on Wall Street.
B000P0J02E|3.0|I am a big Hans Zimmer fan but I didnt like this soundtrack very much. I really only bought it for the first track on the CD - Hoist the Colours. Its really short, only 1:31. I wish there were an extended edition available.
0316017922|5.0|I am a real fan of Malcolm Gladwell.  This book is another home run, in my opinion.  His revelations about human behavior are always interesting, make sense and are surprising, nonetheless.  He thinks outside of the box.  Every parent and teacher should read \\"Outliers\\" for insight into what goes into success and how little things can help or hinder all of us.  I find his books so interesting that I usually read them twice.  If you have never read Gladwell, pick this one up and then work your way through his other books.
B00006AUIG|4.0|The atmosphere in this film is just brilliant. The setting puts you on edge to begin with since it takes place in an abandoned mental hospital, but even deserted there's just something about the building that doesn't seem right. It's like something has infected the structure down to its core. The setting seems to rely heavily on luminescence or the lack thereof. Even when a room in the hospital is illuminated, it still feels dark. Darkness still overwhelms it like it's hiding something. In addition to that, there's the Mary Hobbes subplot that makes the film that much more disturbing. But the less you know about that going into the film, the better.<br /><br />While the film has a fantastic atmosphere, it seems to be lacking something to make it a superb film. Everything seems to be there as the script is good, the writing is top notch, can't complain about the acting, there's a bit of a twist in the ending that's really well done, and the film stays with you long after you watch it. The best explanation is that it had all the elements of a superb film, but it dropped the ball slightly in its execution. The pieces of the puzzle weren't put together in exactly the right way, but were put together in a way that still resulted in a good psychological horror film.<br /><br />Session 9 is the perfect horror film for people who like films that mess with their head. It gets beneath your skin and stays there. While the film is practically a cult classic and contains all the elements of a great horror film, it seems to be lacking something. The best way to explain it is to say Session 9 is a superb psychological horror film that just wasn't as good to this reviewer as it is to others, but that could always change with repeat viewings of the film.

B0028K31CE|4.0|Maxwell is very talented and has once again put out some good music after his long hiatus. The album starts off with really strong with Bad habits, Cold, and Pretty Wings. The next two songs HELP SOMEBODY and STOP THE WORLD sort of remind me a some old Marvin Gaye songs (just not as good as his songs). They are not my favorites on the album but they are still decent songs. The last three songs are good and the album ends with the last track as an instrumental. Lyrically and the production of the album will not disappoint you at all. The only complaint i would have is that the album is too short. After 8 years i thought the album would have 12 songs at minimum. Other than that this is a very respectable effort by Maxwell.<br /><br />Stand out tracks:<br /><br />Bad Habits<br />Cold<br />Pretty Wings<br /><br />In the day and age of technology. Most of the material you see on the dvd can be found on the internet on sites like youtube. So you could save yourself a few dollars and get the version without the dvd.

B001DJLCPE|4.0|[[ASIN:B0002XNSY0 Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]    Of the four major classic Anti-War movies (Dr Stranglove-War / The Day the Earth Stood Still-SciFi / FailSafe-Drama / On the Beach-Melodramatic); Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Quit Worrying  and Love the Bomb is the most humorous, pogniant and difficult to dismiss of them all.  Sometimes your have to revisit a movie to grasp just how amazing a cinematagraphy adventure it really is.  Dr Strangelove is that movie.  Directed by Stanley Kubrick, it possess an insane humor, scenes that still reverberate in movies today (Slim Pickens riding a Thermonuclear Bomb down to Earth like a bronking stallion) and the absurdity of a Mine-Shaft gap!  If you've never seen this movie, I urge you to take a look.  It is well worth your time and a worthy addition to any DVD collectors library.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm no audiophile or anything, I usually just go with the cheap behind the head headphones or something, but I got a promotion at work and very soon after someone sat on my old pair, so I figured I'd replace them with something nice to celebrate.  I looked around for the best pair I could find for a reasonable price, and these seemed like the choice.  I was blown away by these - the bass response was incredible.  I feel like I can hear every instrument that's playing, I can hear the bass like no other headphone I've ever experienced, they are comfortable and the cord is long enough so I can move around at my desk and still be plugged in.  I don't think I've even begun to scratch the surface with these since I just plug it into my ipod, instead of a professional amplifier or something, and my audio bitrate is 128 or maybe 192 but man these things are sweet.  Its hard to bring them to work since they are so large and I'm afraid of breaking them (they seem sturdy but have the dj flip thing going on and I'm a bit clumsy with my headphones), but other than that these are an engineering marvel.  If you don't have these, you haven't really listened to your music yet.

B00005MP58|3.0|After having seen the latest version with Kiera Knightly and Mathew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy, I found this version to be pretty much a let down. I have always enjoyed the roles I've seen Peter Firth in but I found his reprisal of Mr. Darcy to be downright boring. Also, I found the woman who played Lizzy's mother to be so shrill that I winced every time she came on screen. I kept waiting for the film to get better as the minutes wore on - but no such luck. A disappointment from some pretty good actors.

0061706620|3.0|I was pretty excited to read my copy of JWJ.  I'd heard good things about it and I'm a huge fan of storylines that have to do with John and the Winchester brothers back when they were kids.  JWJ seemed like it would a great way to get some backstory.    Unfortunately, it seems that the author got a bit ahead of himself when plotting out that backstory and ignored some crucial bits of characterization as a result.  There are several bits of canon that are left out (part of this I can't blame him for; there are things he might not have known about because they hadn't been released yet) but more than once what he writes directly contradicts what's displayed in the show.  This is displayed right from the very first paragraph:  \\"I went to Missouri and learned the truth.  And from her...\\"  Points to Irvine for remembering the line from Home; unfortunately, he should have remembered that there was NO description of Missouri as a person, hence the surprise on Dean's part when it came to actually meeting her.      Another thing that got me was just how clearly John's affection, love and worry for his boys came out.  As someone who likes a bit of fluff, that's always a pleasure to read but as a canon fan, I've got to raise the unfortunate issue that neither Sam nor Dean were EVER certain of John's feelings towards them and had they written proof of the truth, neither would have displayed the level of filial angst we see in the show itself.  In a story written from John's perspective, the proof of his emotions towards his sons would have been fantastic but it just doesn't work in a book purporting to be the same journal that Sam and Dean take with them on their own journey.    There are several other details that don't make too much sense to me, but I'll let readers discover those on their own, rather than pointing them all out.  Also, the book has some interesting factoids on the cases that John worked on and I did enjoy the gradual demonstration of his increasing skills (andgeneral coldness, even the slight distraction from his focus on getting vengeance for Mary's murder as he got more caught up in the hunt itself) as time progressed.  If the book had focused more on that instead of on the emotional vulnerabilities, I'd have very easily seen it as John's journal.  As it was, those tidbits were definitely a distraction, especially as we see in canon that John's journal was extremely succinct and often entries were drilled down to one or two sentences and ALWAYS were focused on the case, not on his own emotional state or those of his sons.    I'd love to see the author actually write a book from John's perspective, especially if he got someone to work with him on some of the canon details.  I think at some point he mentions buying a Mac for Sam, for instance; canon!John would have had NO desire to do this.  Apples are expensive and unnecessary for the sort of work they were doing, given that it was in the 96-97 timeframe.  A laptop at the time would have been an extreme luxury; paying for a Mac unnecessarily is just too much for me to believe, even on false credit cards, when we have canon proof that money was an issue.     All in all, it's a decent read.  It's well written, occasionally intriguing, but it does not fit the basic requirements necessary to actually be John Winchester's Journal.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|Why aren't Warner Bros releasing this two-disc Director's Cut (+ Digital Copy) here in the UK? Surely Warners would like to make as much money back as possible, especially after the film's less than spectacular theatrical performance?

0142000671|5.0|These are the two words I have to describe this book. It's a short work of genius, and it fully immerses you in its world for the all-too-short time that it lasts. With its masterfully crafted characterization and storyline woven so perfectly, it has you tightly wrapped around its proverbial fingers until its heartbreaking conclusion.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Not what I expected, but still good.  Slow moving, for the most part, but, still, worth seeing.
B001HPP2XW|4.0|If you're looking for a movie where characters throw classy lines at each other, two people find love, but one of them is afraid of commitment, an annoying and very un-Asian Asian neighbour (yeah, I know, it's Mickey) is a victim of painful slapstick and there is apparently nothing going on, look no further than \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\". Now, I know what you're thinking: \\"there has to be something going on, especially in a movie that is awarded four stars!\\" Well, the thing is, there really isn't much of a plot here, but that's actually complementary to other aspects of the film: the casting is superb, the sets are lovely and the acting is convincing. Forget about genre classification. This is supposed to be a romantic comedy, but it's neither romantic nor a comedy. The movie is definitely a class of its own. In a little under two hours, you're likely to sit back and relax with a set of emotions and sceneries.<br /><br />The everenchanting Audrey Hepburn plays an emotionally-wrecked playgirl Holly Golightly, while her male counterpart Paul Varjak is played by George Peppard. The two make for a good on-screen chemistry, even if it takes them a whole movie to finally get it on. This so-called \\"romance\\" blossoms when the odd couple gets a chance to have a spontaneous day in New York, doing the things they've never done before. The only positively charming (read: romantic) scene in the movie is when Paul and Holly steal masks from a shop, startle a cop and kiss in their hallway. I could go on and on about what happens in the movie, but that's not the point.<br /><br />The overall mood is carefully set and executed, so that the movie evokes feelings of both emptiness and warmness. The emptiness comes from the lives protagonists live: the only thing that makes Holly earthbound is that she cares deeply about her brother in the Navy, while Paul's life isn't exactly a rich one. Holly, especially, makes you think about how sad life can be, as well as trying to find freedom when you are your own cage. The warmness comes from the direction which makes it a colorful, but modest piece where parties go rampant and a Cracker Jack gift carries an actual poignancy. Holly gets the mean reads every now and then which make her a human, after all (the only one we see in the movie is when she finds out about Fred's accident).<br /><br />Still, characters strike you as unusually two-dimensional beings, never really reaching their emotional climaxes, which is something you expect from a dramatic piece. On the other hand, it's exactly what makes \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" such an odd movie (or a romantic comedy, if you will): there are all these highs and lows -- both emotional and plot-wise -- but it still manages to be a \\"safe ride\\" for a viewer. Neither a chick flick or a dude flick, it's more of a movie that will make an average viewer think thoroughly about THEIR life. Maybe you'll find yourself sympathizing with Holly's aleatory position and Paul's need to belong to someone who belongs to him. Maybe you'll find yourself comfortable in your own skin because you're neither of the two.<br /><br />\\"Tiffany's\\" isn't a complex movie, per se, but it hides a mighty afterthought below all the Manhattan gloss. Strikingly middle-of-the-road and maybe a tad slow-paced, it still manages to make active viewers out of its audience. So, to paraphrase what I said at the beginning of the review: if you're looking for a movie with which you'll find yourself abundantly grateful for your life, where you'll be hooked on the atmosphere, but end up liking the overall aspects of the film, where you feel sorry for the characters (for all the typical and atypical reasons) and a very un-Asian Asian neighbour (yeah, I know, it's Mickey) is a victim of painful slapstick, look not further than \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\". It might push your buttons, but it might also leave you indifferent and cold. Sometimes both, sometimes neither.wn cage.

B000000OA6|5.0|That just depends on what constitues Classic.  Truthfully I put off buying Innuendo because I really didn't think I'd like the product.  Afterall you can see it all on YouTube...So why buy.    Well why buy?   Simply having Innuendo CD playing on your own MP3, IPod, Cell or what ever, you will get better quality of sound and not have to be bothered by all the buffering that goes on with YouTube.    Truthfully I can not tell you which is Classic Queen I just know that their music is and always will be the very best on this planet.  Nobody has ever or will ever be able to come close to Freddie Mercury's vocal stylings.  So there you got my opinion.  These are awesome and unique melodies put forth my the very best musicians in the history of this galaxy.     Yes I admit that I am totally addicted to music of Freddie Mercury and Queen.  Surely I'm not alone.  Join us.
B000RZGIQ8|4.0|I hadn't seen this movie in almost 20 years.  Whatever passes as story and characters that they put as padding between the flight scenes are so embarassingly formulaic and stupid that I was soon hitting fast forward every time until jets were scrambling again.  Apart from the \\"last fight\\" scene which is spoiled by terrible missile hit SFXs, the air scenes are stunning in HD.  That photography really makes this disc great.  That's my first movie purchase that made me fully satisfied of switching to Blu Ray.  You've GOT to have a serious sound system hooked on your player too.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|The subtitle controversy surrounding this film is over.  Versions with theatrical subtitles are now available.  I purchased one at Target after buying a Blu-ray from Amazon with the dummbed down subtitles. The theatrical subtitles are better but they did not change my overall extremely high regard for this movie, i.e. I could not love this movie more than I already do!    If you've viewed the dubbed version of this movie, you have not seen it!  The dubbing in this movie is an abomination! The two young lead actors in this film are phenomenal.  The heart wrenching raw emotion these two kids were able to deliver was nothing short of miraculous!  These two unknown kids have delivered performances that blow our Hollywood blockbuster actors right off the screen!  The script is perfect, the musical score is haunting, the cinematography is stunning, the casting of the lead roles was exceptional, and the directing was flawless.  Every once in a rare while everything comes together perfectly while producing a movie, and a brilliant film like \\"Let the Right One in\\" is created.    One last thing, this movie is an adaptation of a book.  The director shows and tells the audience his own interpretation. To take what is shown and told in the movie and extrapolate it into a homosexual relationship between Oskar and Eli (as some reviewers have done) is preposterous!

While this is a well laid out and executed cd with very good vocals from primarily Charolette Wessels; it is a step below Within Temptation in range, power, diversity and composition to me.  That being said there is a lot to praise about the Symphonic Metal being produced over the last 20 years in the Netherlands.  I am impressed by the amount of musician co-operation between bands in the Netherlands.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer of \\"Lucidity\\" (a different Delain cd) that if you are tired of female, mezzo-soprano lead orchestra metal bands then Delain is a refreshing vocal change.  Personally I would purchase Delain only after completing my Within Temptation and The Gathering (those with Anneke van Giersbergen).
B000LE0TGA|5.0|ELO outdid themselves with this one (which Jeff Lynne said he wrote in some unbelievably short amount of time, like three months). Who knew the sounds of pop, rock and orchestra could be merged? Apparently Jeff Lynne did and the result is incredible sound and vocals.
B000UJCALI|1.0|I went to rent the remake of the \\"Friday the 13th\\", but the cashier told me to check out \\"The Shining\\" instead for some quality horror. I was skeptical but approached it with an open-mind, even though I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the Friday the 13th remake. Boo! This movie sucked! The things in it were so random, like the bear suit guy and the blood spilling down the stairs. They didn't even have to do with the plot. The acting was horrible, too. I was hoping Wendy would've been axed already so she'd finally shut up and get back in the kitchen! This movie is so un-scary that I thought I'd never be scared again. Then I saw gems like \\"Orgy of the Dead\\", \\"Dead End Road\\", \\"The Dentist\\" and \\"Turistas\\" and realized that good horror films do exist, just skip this Shining crap!

Check out \\"St. Anger\\", \\"All The Right Reasons\\", \\"Metal Machine Music\\" or \\"American Idiot\\" for some facemelting solos from true fretboard masters!

0307165485|5.0|In every adult is a child who plays, and this particular Storybook most beautifully illustrates the loving playful bond between child and parent. Where else do we first begin how to learn and play than on a parent's lap or tucked up in bed hearing stories and songs? There are even stories in here about daddies being daddies, and they are being told by one generation to another the world over. Richard Maclure Scarry is, quite possibly, the most well known children's author/illustrator to ever put pen to paper. His work excels at celebrating our many connections to everything in the Universe around us.<br /><br />This 288 page book is a must have for every small child, and one cannot help thinking that Scarry must have been one of those rare and exceedingly clever souls who has not only learned the importance of playing with your inner child, but has found a way to share this wisdom with everyone who picks up one of his books! Even for it's hardbound size, the Best Storybook is relatively light, and perfect storybook size when you have a wee one or two tucked into your lap. Even infants enjoy looking at the clever and colorful pictures, and there are plenty of opportunities for them to learn to identify every day items from food to clothing, and more uncommon items like musical instruments or heavy machines, throughout the book.<br /><br />The way the book is set up, there are many of these identification illustrations sets with amusing stories and cartoons scattered throughout. In the two page illustration entitled A Castle In Denmark, for example, we learn some rules that \\"you must obey if you life in a castle; or even if you live in a house.\\" Tiny mouse people the floors of the castle imparting wisdom like the importance of not leaving toys on stairs, feeding your dragon, and putting your broom away after you have finished flying.<br /><br />In Whisper In My Ear, Mrs. Mouse helps us count to 12 by whispering in her friend Elephant's ear all the nice things in her tiny house. Mrs. Mouse's 12 children impishly awake from their nap is a delightful conclusion to this counting tale. Is This The House of Mistress Mouse? is a charming tale of how Mrs. and Mr. Mouse met. Polite Elephant helps little ones begin to understand how to interact with others, but not every tale in here has some pointed lesson.<br /><br />Many tales are simply things that children can relate to in a pleasant way, like Chipmunk's Birthday Party. Most kids, even quite small ones, can relate to the enjoyment of games, cake and friends. Scarry's trademark whimsy is evident in every tale. Each page is covered with the most enchanting illustrations that capture and delight the imaginations of children as they learn about everything from airplanes to the seasons. The soft blend of colorful images, whimsical characters, and simple well told tales makes a lasting impression.<br /><br />Thumbing through this wonderful book, I can easily remember these illustrations from my own early childhood. I always liked to find Bugdozer, one of Scarry's tiniest characters. How interesting now to look upon this book after having passed the love of these tales and pictures on to not only my own children, but my grandchild and many other small children who have happened across my path! Perfect as a first book through to about the age when your child begins reading confidently on their own, this really is the Best Storybook ever. I've given it often as a first birthday/Christmas, or even as a \\"new baby\\" gift.<br /><br />Remembering how much I loved this book as a girl, it was one of my first purchases when we had our own kids. They wore out two copies before they were grown, and I will never forget the wonder of peeking in on reading sessions where older siblings were reading to younger ones from this magical book. Now, this book graces our shelves yet again as a keepsake after the passing of our grandson who received this book from us on his last birthday. The newest little one in our family, our son's stepdaughter, is my latest in a long line of lapwarmers to enjoy Scarry's work.<br /><br />I honestly believe that no home is complete without this book. Even if you have no children, you never know when you may have a wee visitor. You will definitely leave a lasting positive impression on any future generations by being wise and fun enough to introduce them to reading with this fabulous work by the incomparable Richard Scarry! Remember though that this is not the sort of book to be entrusted to those who have not learned to treat books with respect. The simple pages and Golden Books' binding is not meant to stand up to moist gnawing or aggressive pulling, although it will definitely feed the imaginitive minds of young readers. In my experience, the binding is not the best and even repeated readings over years will certainly wear a copy down to the point where a new one will be needed. When I am too old to sit with a small child and pour over these wondrously illustrated tales, I hope I'm lucky enough to have someone to read to me!in a long line of lapwarmers to enjoy Scarry's work.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|The story makes way more sense, the character Denzel actually feels like hes important with the extra scenes. This is the way the movie should have been originally. 5 stars
0307266303|5.0|If you love running, read this book.  If you like stories about indigenous people, read this book.  If you like human biology/evolution, read this book.  If you like fun, humorous, entertaining books, read this book.  I've seen the reviews about \\"too much hyperbole\\" and too many extreme ultra-marathon characters; don't let it stop you from reading this book.  For a non-ultra-marathoner, even one who has run marathons, the nature of  extreme ultra-running is hyberbolic(like that?) by nature.  I don't know the reality of the people the author writes about, but their individuality, all of 'em, dry scientists to seemingly whacko runners, just feeds the pleasure of the reading of this story.      If your taste for non-fiction means that it should be very dry and straightforward, then you can find the scientific journals that espouse the theories that the story touches upon.  For me, the author's job was to make the story entertaining.  You can read the story of one of the races, the Leadville 100, by one of the many characters in this book, at Caballo Blanco's website.  I advise you to do this AFTER reading Christopher McDougall's version in this book so you can see how a master storyteller can make a tale riveting.  And you know what?  It's not hyperbole, it's how he see's it.  Bottom line is that his storytelling matched the main thesis of the book:  running is a joy and pleasure as great as an physical activity.  I know this from personal experience, and Mr. McDougall exemplified it in his writing:  pure pleasure, to me.  I could have read this book in one night and instead I stretched it out over three weeks on a family road trip and relished it like a long run. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much.

0566080389|4.0|Bought on the recommendation of a prof.  Overall, the book did a fair job of teaching critical chain principles without the textbook boredom.  Comparing the book to Goldratt's 'The Goal', it could have had some more detailed examples and results.  I personally didn't like the 'you can save your marriage if you can earn enough money' romantic side theme. I bought the book to learn, and the book effectively taught.

0385340990|5.0|I've been reading the reviews and although most people loved it, there are some who want more from it, i.e. more history, more Nazi horror, etc.  It always amazes me that people can't accept a book for what it is -- why compare it to something it is not?  It is not a history book -- it is a sweet, compelling love story about nice people.  It's different -- it's an easy read (perhaps some of those who consider themselves intellectuals want deeper, more meaningful prose?)  Accept it for what it is -- a nice read about nice people.  Hated leaving the characters at the end.
B000P0J0EW|1.0|I am writing this only because Shawshank Redemption is the #1 rated film on IMDB.    This movie is about a deep emotional relationship between two men. The entire plot is set into motion by the main character's (Andy Dufresne) scarring disappointment with a woman, his unfaithful wife. Although he does not actually kill her, a botched confrontation and a farfetched coincidence result in his being imprisoned for her murder. This is better than if he had gone through with the murder himself: it is his hatred of a woman that makes him a transgressive. It is the intent, his sin of thought, not an actual deed, which strengthens prison as a metaphor for his burgeoning homosexuality.    In prison, homosexuality is normalized. This is achieved not only through the characters of \\"the sisters,\\" who violently rape Dufresne repeatedly, but also in other ways, such as the inmates' referral to new arrivals as \\"fresh fish.\\" And of course, prison is a space where social intercourse occurs only between men. It is in this context that Dufresne develops his bond with the other lead, Ellis Redding. Through Dufresne's relationship with Red a distinction is made between what could be called the involuntary or forced homosexuality of \\"the sisters\\" and voluntary or romantic homosexuality, such as the unique friendship between Dufresne and Red. After a particularly harsh beating by \\"the sisters\\" that lands Dufresne in the hospital for a couple of weeks, Red organizes a return welcome with the gift of several rocks, which Dufresne desires and uses to make figurines.    The movie's climax, the prison break, also contains some very overt symbolism. The posters of popular actresses that Dufresne obtains from Red and hangs in his cell figure prominently in the film and in the original novella by Stephen King (the novella is titled Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption). Many viewers may have taken this as sufficient \\"signal\\" that the film is not homosexual. However, Dufresne uses one of these posters to cover up the hole he has picked out of the prison wall and uses to escape through the prison's sewer. Here, the escape through the sewer is an obvious symbol for anal sex. A sewer is a long tube that contains human waste, like an anus. It is also possible to describe the moment Andy emerges from the prison's sewer as \\"climactic,\\" characterized by a general feeling of \\"release,\\" and metaphorically the escape through the sewer allows Andy to \\"escape\\" the problems caused by his relationship with his ex-wife. The poster's role in the film is to conceal this opening to the \\"sewer,\\" to the homosexual escape. In the scene leading up to its discovery the warden accuses Red of being \\"as thick as thieves\\" with Dufresne (another metaphor of transgression), then in frustration throws a rock at the poster, after very pointedly accusing it of being a party to the \\"conspiracy.\\" Dramatically, the rock flies through the poster, exposing Dufresne's heterosexual utterance as paper-thin, with nothing to back it. Careful viewers will also note that Dufresne's taste in wall-covering includes many types of posters--Albert Einstein, various maps, portraits, landscapes, etc.--and that the poster concealing the escape route--the specific poster designated to mislead in the film's plot--is, suspiciously, unique in its depiction of a sexualized woman. To escape the confinement caused by his rejection of women, Dufresne turns to the anus, but cannot do so openly; his homosexuality must be concealed with signs of heterosexuality, in this case Raquel Welch.    Tommy's subplot is distinct because it triggers the turn in Andy's character, and it intertwines with Andy's rivalry with Norton. Tommy is the liminal figure in the film; being a new arrival, a caricature of the virulent male, and possessing information from beyond prison that can free Andy, he straddles the divide between the \\"straight\\" world outside and the \\"gay\\" world of the prison. This is why his murder is a turning pointfor Andy. Yes, it destroys his chances of being released, but if you view Norton as representing the perceived heterosexual establishment, which must rule by rational means, Tommy's murder dispels Andy's faith in that rationality and the entire legitimacy of the heterosexual power structure represented by Norton and his guards. Keep in mind that up to this point in the film, Andy was happy to use his talents to gain favor within that structure. In this sense, Andy's payback against Norton carries added meaning. Without being sexual in any way, this is the homosexual fantasy of revenge against a heterosexual power structure which imprisons and confines.    Finally, after breaking out of prison, Dufresne organizes a reunion with his special friend Red by leaving cash and a letter, written in flowing script, in a tin box by a wall on a prairie. He has given Red instructions to locate the box with a compass, and Red uses the money to travel to Dufresne's secret location in Mexico, where the two men reunite on a sandy beach next to the ocean. This is how the film ends. Dufresne and Red finally find their homosexual paradise: a place where their love can be consumated outside of \\"prison,\\" i.e. where their homosexuality does not make them transgressors in the eyes of society.    I fully realize this review is going to ruin my helpful/not helpful ratio as a reviewer. It needed to be said.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|I must admit that I was leery of this show. Too often have spin offs devolved into mindless drivel. However, to my surprise, the first season has so far proved to be entertaining. It's hardly Shakespearean, but it is effective, works with good special effects and has some reasonable acting.     My personal favourite is Summer Glau playing Cameron the allied Terminator. This is a deceptively hard role to play, and she does it well, and is provided with some nice script touches that add humour.    The other cast members are competent, and though none are brilliant, they are good in their roles.    The action sequences and special effects are well handled and I was overall quite impressed with the first season.    I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Terminator movies and who doesn't mind the occasional slow pacing.

B001FSDOZO|4.0|I was a fan of Nickelback's first album, The State, and then they dropped off my radar because they became a bit too mainstream. I liked the first one because of the heavy bottom end, the lyrics, and the guitars.  I stopped listening to them, and a friend let me listen to this for a bit.  I was hooked on it.  There are some ballads thrown in there (they won't mess with a good successful commercial formula) but there are other songs that are the heaviest songs they've released since #1.      If you liked The State, you'll like this.  And even if you like some of their newer stuff, you'll still like this album.
B00260HH3K|4.0|The Dragon ball name is something that holds a special place in the hearts of many fans, some die hard and some casual. Those hearts were undoubtedly broken when the announcement of an American made live action adaptation of the anime series was to be made. Whether you enjoy this movie really depends on the context of which you watch it. If you watch it and are a fan of the anime and expect it to match what you would see as the greatness of the anime and comics, then you will be disappointed. If you are not a fan but are still expecting a high octane action packed fantasy film, then you're going to be disappointed again. One way I think you would enjoy this, which is the way I looked at it, is if you don't have high expectations to begin with. That may be an obvious perspective, but given the way Hollywood works, quality films based on a comic and anime legacy such as Dragon ball are just not going to happen.<br /><br />The story focuses on Goku (Justin Chatwin), who seeks out, upon his adoptive grandfather Grandpa Gohan's (Randall Duk Kim) dying request, to find the great Master Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat) and gather all seven Dragon Balls. These seven dragon balls, when brought together allow the one who recites the ancient prayer one ultimate wish. There is a danger that the alien Lord Picolo (James Marsters), who is also on a mission to re-unite the Dragon Balls will succeed in his mission and use his wish to destroy the world. Goku and friends, Bulma (Emmy Rossum), Master Roshi, Yamcha (Joon Park) and love interest Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) embark on the dangerous mission to find all 7 Dragon Balls before Picolo.<br /><br />When you tackle a comic and anime show such as this, there's a tight rope to walk for the director as he has to decide what can be included and what should be dismissed to combine the right level of real life antics with the fantasy nature of the characters and surroundings. There's also a comedy element that the director had to contend with so getting the balance perfect would be a massive challenge. Luckily, the balance worked very well into what was ultimately a light hearted and enjoyable movie for the whole family. Some of the better fight scenes are very well choreographed and take place during the first 45 minutes of the film and actually one of my favourite scenes places Goku outside a house party, being confronted by a gang of thugs and takes them all out without having to touch one of them. It's a scene that is very well shot and choreographed brilliantly to the point where the CGI moments even seem plausible in a reality situation.<br /><br />The special effects, for a $50 million budget were really well and managed to convey the epic feel of the plot. However, one thing I didn't find really worked were the environments and the blending of the physical sets with the CGI expansions don't come together very well and it's obvious where the real set ends and the computer set begins. This detracts a lot from the overall feel of the movie and it's obvious that the lack of detail in the real sets compared to the CGI horizons are how it becomes so revealing.  Justin Chatwin does a capable job of playing the main character of Goku and it's certainly a brave role to take on as it's undoubtedly a character loved by many and he would expectedly receive massive criticism from the loyal fan base regardless of how good he will have been. James Marsters as Picolo is a good villain but the character itself doesn't have enough air time to really judge the acting ability within the role. Chow Yun-Fat is a delightful addition to the movie and he certainly takes on a comic style that makes him a very delightful comic character and a worthy choice as fight trainer.<br /><br />I found this a very enjoyable film and as I'm not even acquainted with the Dragon Ball legacy, I suppose that was why I was able to view this film with casual enjoyment. If you are a fan of the comics and anime there will undoubtedly be a plethora of things you can pick out of this film about why it shouldn't be associated with the original anime and comic. My advice would to be just enjoy it as a light hearted feature and not think too much into it as I guarantee you will enjoy it much more.ilm about why it shouldn't be associated with the original anime and comic. My advice would to be just enjoy it as a light hearted feature and not think too much into it as I guarantee you will enjoy it much more.

B000002VCB|5.0|Eve is, in most peoples eyes, an average album.  An album that indicates to most people that the Alan Parsons Project was starting to go downhill as far as songwriting is concerned, and perhaps people were beginning to feel Alan Parsons was getting a little *too* comfortable with their songwriting habits and abusing the formula.    Me?  I think Eve is a GREAT album.  Not only am I really surprised how memorable the songs are, I'm also surprised the songwriting is on the same level as the three albums the band released before this one.  Honestly, there's not a single weak moment here.  Sure, the album sounds like a typical late 70's rock album with an influence in the disco movement thanks to the drums and the rhythm beats, but who cares?      These songs are *very* good.  The fact the album ends with some women given the chance to showcase their vocal talent is quite a welcome surprise.  I love this album and refuse to believe the band was losing their touch with Eve.
0140306013|5.0|I remember reading this first as a child (around 12 years old) when it was, indeed, a story about rabbits and their struggle for survival.

A great addition to any child's (and adult's) reading list.
B00005MNP7|5.0|While I prefer the more punk-ish style that Blondie was doing on the first couple albums, it's hard to deny how fantastic Eat to the Beat is.  It's really a shame this album is ignored the way it is today, because back in the day, this album was considered a huge deal and was quite popular.    To me, this album deserves to be remembered for, of course, the songwriting.  Blondie was one band that knew how to put a song together.  Honestly, you have to go out of your way to hate a Blondie song, and you can't deny that even when you don't like one of their songs, it's at least catchy.      With that said, the songwriting on Eat to the Beat is perhaps slightly worse compared to the brilliance that is Parallel Lines, but not by much.  Luckily Blondie was born with an incredible singing gift where even the weaker moments can be forgiven just by the sound of her voice alone.  Not every musician can make that possible in my eyes, but somehow Blondie pulled it off.      Remember Blondie, and remember a legendary group that had everything going right for them at one point in time, and remember them for their incredible songwriting talent and a lead singer with a voice that makes angels more beautiful.

B00004Z4WQ|4.0|This isn't in the same league as Airplane! or Spaceballs. Here, the humor is more crude and . . . well . . . stupider. You won't get much toilet humor here, though. It's more about sex, homosexuality, stupid teenage girls, stoners, and, of course, the horror films of the late 90's. From \\"Scream\\" to \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\\" It's always nice to see a spoof of these silly teenage horror flicks that give only cheap thrills. And not only that, there's even some \\"Matrix\\" and \\"Usual Suspects\\" thrown in. Despite its lack of originality, this is still very funny. So what if it's downright stupid? It's a comedy! It's made to make us all laugh. And MAN, did it make me laugh?<br /><br />I'm not really into the more recent spoofs (like \\"Epic Movie\\" and \\"Dance Flick\\") that fail in many levels, but the first two \\"Scary Movie\\" flicks I really enjoyed watching. The first one, in particular, has to be the funniest out of all of them.

B001RIY4WE|4.0|I hesitated about buying this movie when i read a few reviews saying they couldn't see the image or they have to have internet connection to watch it , but I decided to give it a try, and I don't regret it. First, my sony blue ray is not connected to the internet and i had no trouble watching it at all, sound and picture are excellent, Eventhough is an old movie but it is worthy to get it
B000VDDWDS|5.0|Having read the whole O'Brian collection is a must to have this movie. I have it in DVD already, but BR worth the buy
B0017YZI7S|5.0|I saw the concert 3 times.  I have 2 versions of the CD.  I have the regular DVD.  And now I have the Blu-ray.  Of course the live concerts are the best, but this is the second best way to enjoy the concert.  Sit back and enjoy the boys on a 52\\" HDTV in Blu-ray.  If you are a Stones fan, this is a must have.  If you are just so-so with them, buy this anyway.  Whatever you do, buy this.
B00004W510|5.0|Well..here we are 40 years after the release of The Band's second album, The Band, and I have come to the conclusion that this is the greatest album of all time. Why? Because it sounds like it could have been recorded in 1865, 1880, 1910, 1930 or 1950. 12 charming American short stories told with wit, wisdom and depth. The musicianship is outstanding but never over the top, just subtle nuances that add texture to the stories told. Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, Garth Hudson and Levon Helm have created a poignant Americana masterpiece. The lyrics may haunt you for the rest of your life....\\"careful where you step,,and watch what you eat...sleep with a light and you got it beat.\\" My favorites: ALL OF THEM! Every cut is like a Rolls Royce. Outstanding and Timeless!
0307408833|1.0|This is uncategorically the worst cookbook I have ever used.  I am an excellent baker, but my son has food allergies so I've had to expand my catalog of recipes (no butter, no eggs).  So far, I have tried three recipes from this cookbook (corn bread, banana bread and pumpkin-spice muffins), and nothing, I mean nothing, has turned out well.  Today I made the banana bread and it not only overflowed my standard-sized loaf pan, but it took an extra 1/2 hour to cook and still turned out mushy.    In regard to the recipes' ingredients, I want to echo a previous reviewers' comments that it is very irritating the author does not indicate the preferred type of agave syrup to use (light? dark? raw?).  Also, coconut oil is more or less solid at room temperature (very hard to handle).  So how is one supposed to measure it out (it doesn't get soft like butter)?  Is it OK to melt it in the microwave and use it in a liquid form?  I'd rather not need to experiement myself as the ingredients are very expensive and I don't have time to create my own recipes.  The author also fails to inform the reader that spelt contains gluten (I had to do extra research to find this out); in a book labeled \\"(mostly) gluten free\\", the least she could have done was indicate when she was using ingredients with gluten in them.    If you are a vegan and are not too concered about sugar (vs. agave) or wheat flour, I highly recommend that you check out Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World by Isa Moskowitz.  Her other two cookbooks are also fantastic.  You might also want to check out the Joy of Vegan Baking, although I have had mixed results with its recipes (the chocolate bundt cake rocks while the sugar cookies could be used as hockey pucks).
0385340567|1.0|I was going to write a review that hit all of the points mentioned in the other reviews.  Therefore, my review in detail is not necassary.  I agree with the points made about the silly criticism of the iraq war, the silly subplot of deserters(Lee Child should talk to some actual iraq vets and those still serving>  The soldiers over there have seen real evil, the terrorists and their iranian supporters, and they know what they are doing is important and necassary.), and the silly story of the injured husband.  If anything, Lee Child, from Britain, I believe, should see the care of injured american service personel as the damning of a national health service.  If wounded vets do not recieve the best of care,(just look to recent articles on prostrate surgery at va hospitals, 92 out of 116 of these procedures were incorrectly done), that should tell every american that national health care would be a disaster.  I also agree that his target audience is conservative anti-crime, pro-millitary readers.  Keep up the political silliness and I will stop reading this series.  I read these books to be entertained.  If I want left wing anti-millitary, anti-religion, anti-war on terrorism drivel, I'll watch CNN or MSNBC.  Also, the point where the police officer helping reacher refuses to wear her service pistol to a known dangerous situation because she doesn't wear her gun off duty was not only clumsy but it defied common sense.  It must reflect the reflexive european attitude toward private ownership of firearms.  Another point that Lee Child should keep in mind.  Many of the characters in his books would be alive if they were allowed to conceal and carry a firearm.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|For 90 minutes I couldn't sit still and yet I was mesmerized and captured the entire time mind blowing time. I've always been a fan and I've seen Michael perform (not in person) but it's been a while.     There is NO ONE like him nor will there ever be again. He is pure talent and holds male and female in the palm of his hand when he performs.     I can't say enough about this DVD. And I can't believe I didn't own it until now.    Rest in peace my Brother. I miss you and love you.
B00003CXD5|5.0|I have to agree with the first reviewer, this film, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, along with Greed are the best films about Greed ever made.  This one has beautiful deep focus photography, great writing, direction and acting.  (Greed does too.)  The more I see this film, the more I find in the film.  No shot is left to chance and everything drives the story forward.  Humphrey Bogart plays a shifty character from the US traveling to Mexico to search for gold in the Sierra Madre mountain range.  He has no money and begs other Americans for money.  Finally he is given a job and uses the money to go into the gold digging business with other Americans played by Tim Holt and Walter Huston.  What happens then is tragic.  The men all want gold but Humphrey Bogart's character is willing to stop at nothing to get it while the others seem to have some scruples.... or do they?  Wonderful, hard bitten film.
1439138311|4.0|Colm Toibin, long recognized for his sensitive character studies, adds to his list of fine accomplishments with this memorable study of young Eilis Lacey, on her own in New York while the remainder of her family stays behind in Enniscorthy, County Wexford.  It is less than a decade after World War II, jobs are hard to come by, and the economy in Ireland is a disaster.  When Father Flood, an Irish priest with a parish in Brooklyn, returns home for a brief vacation, he suggests that he can find Eilis a good job.  Though Eilis is woefully unprepared for the cultural changes that she will face, she decides to leave the familiarity of home for a new world.  \\"Parts of Brooklyn are just like Ireland.  They're full of Irish,\\" she is told.<br /><br />Focusing on the minutiae of life, which is Eilis's own focus, Toibin recreates her passage across a stormy Atlantic, her introduction to life in a Brooklyn boarding house, with its assortment of characters, and her experience as a saleswoman at a department store in the ethnically changing Brooklyn neighborhood where she lives.  She sometimes attends Saturday dances at the local parish hall, and she attends night school, studying to become a bookkeeper/accountant.  It is certainly not an exciting life, and it is not an exciting plot, yet Toibin recreates Eilis's feelings within these scenes so minutely and chooses his descriptive details so carefully, that her life becomes a delicate drama, a life filled with universal themes \\"writ small.\\"<br /><br />As she faces the challenges of her new life in Brooklyn,we see her as immature, naïve, and touchingly anxious to please.  Sometimes timid, she is also, on occasion, almost impossibly righteous.  Despite her firm grounding in her Catholic faith, however, she is surprisingly enigmatic and vacillating--reluctant to take chances--and she can try the patience of her reader as much as she does some of the characters in the novel.  Through his simple and straightforward language and imagery, however, Toibin allows us to share Eilis's inner life, and we come to know her on an emotional level.  Immature and \\"unformed\\" as she may be, she is understandable and comes alive.  When she meets Tony, \\"innocent, eager and shiny,\\"  at a parish dance, it appears to be an ideal romance.<br /><br />A trip home to Ireland leads to the climax, in which Eilis, like so many other emigrants before her, must confront how much she may have changed, if at all, as a result of her experience in another world and what she sees as her future.  Readers may argue about the \\"rightness\\" of the conclusion, the realism or its lack in Part IV, and the extent to which the author relies on coincidence to resolve the action, but in his characterization of an often conflicted main character (and in the vibrant supporting characters), Toibin has created a memorable novel which proves that a character \\"drama\\" like this need not always be shocking in order to be \\"dramatic.\\"  n  Mary Whipple<br /><br />[[ASIN:0743203313 The Blackwater Lightship: A Novel]]<br />[[ASIN:0743250400 The Master]]ry, however, Toibin allows us to share Eilis's inner life, and we come to know her on an emotional level.

1932100660|1.0|Many claims made in this book are in defiance of medical history and common sense.<br /><br />Degenerative diseases emerged explosively in the 20th century (following the invention of the high speed steel roller mill, which made white flour and white sugar very cheap).  Yet people have been consuming animal products since long before the 20th century.  The explosive growth of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease does not correspond to an explosion in the consumption of animal foods.<br /><br />The book doesn't mention America's premiere thinker on nutrition and health, Weston Price.  It doesn't explain why the French, Swiss, and Eskimos are healthier than Americans, despite their diets rich in saturated animal fats.<br /><br />This book was extremely disappointing, and I would not recommend it to anyone.

B001FB4W0C|5.0|Season 4 has been phenomenal. The season finale was incredibly good. I really was worried when they brought angels and the idea of God into the mix but they did it tactfully and it made for a great storyline and good episodes. Special effects are good, I can't wait for season 5. This is one of the best if not the best show on television.
B00069A5GY|2.0|Well, I'm a huge fan of Mark and I have a couple of copies of this album on CD, so I was really looking forward to hearing the DVD audio version. I know this to be a very well recorded album. Imagine my surprise when I heard the lead vocal in panned fully into the center channel and clearly too hot on a couple of tracks and, therefore,  causing audible clipping in the associated DA converters in both my home and car players. It's not a problem with every track so I'm wondering whether the mixes were all done by the same person or this was done ad hoc to take advantage of the audiophile segment of Marks' fan base. The experience has been disappointing to say the least.
B0028SVXR6|4.0|As you probably know, Octahedron is billed as The Mars Volta's acoustic album. You can take that however you want, but honestly, it's no more of an acoustic album than Amputechture. With 3/8 of the songs being mid-tempo, non-aggressive tracks, you could make the argument, but only two of the songs even have acoustic guitars as far as I can hear. That's alright though, one can't judge an album poorly simply because the album's creator has a misleading view of the contents, you have to judge the contents themselves.    Maybe it's not an acoustic album, but it is certainly the most standardized (and unfortunately formulaic) offering from them so far. If you want an idea of every song on the album, I think I discovered the formula the boys used before writing each track:    \\"Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Interlude-Chorus-Chorus-Ambiance\\"    That's not to say that the material can't be excellent even in such a predictable form, popular music has been doing it for decades, after all. The songs are all up-front without the frills and studio-dickery that sometimes (always) plagues their albums, although almost every song has between 30 seconds and 3 minutes of ambiance between it and the next song; tiresome if you just want to hear music, but better than mid-song noise (see Frances the Mute).    The music itself most resembles material from De-Loused in the Comatorium: post-rock anthems with jagged riffs. Actually, some of it is TOO much like it, \\"Since We've Been Wrong\\" is barely distinguishable from \\"Televators\\". With each album they release, I've felt that TMV have rapidly been developing their own unique sound, but with Octahedron, it's like they've taken three steps backward. It makes for an album that easier to listen to with the uninitiated friend, but it seems like they've ignored all of the progress they've made in six years, as intolerable the recent sounds may be to some.    So the album is predictable (as far as popular music goes, not by Mars Volta standards), butgood all the way through, right? Well, some of the songs fall short in my opinion, actually. \\"With Twilight As My Guide\\" is one of the mellow songs, and the weakest of the three. As acoustic as the album gets, it's a very simple and somewhat bland song with some of the most inane lyrics Cedric has pumped out (where does one man get so many obtuse words and contexts?), with embarrassing lines like \\"My devil makes me dream like no other mortal dreams\\", it wears out its welcome fairly soon. The interlude sounds nice, but then you realize it's not any more complicated than something Evanescence might create, and then you lose faith in humanity all over again (that's why you became a Mars Volta fan, right?).    Another weird track is \\"Desperate Graves\\", the verse has a lilting, almost regal melody which is really kind of irritating and cheesy, if you added a lute or two you might expect to hear it at a renaissance fair this weekend (if that's your kind of thing; I won't judge you). Then it suddenly jumps into a De-loused-esque chorus, back to the verse and so on (refer to the formula above if you've forgotten how it goes).    With the less-than-perfect tracks comes some much more entertaining material, \\"Teflon\\", \\"Cotopaxi\\" and \\"Luciforms\\" are as straight-forward as you could hope for from the band, just pounding, aggressive fare which easily dismiss the \\"acoustic\\" notion of the album as a whole. All three follow the quiet songs, exploding from the muffled outros and re-energizing the album each time.    On the mellow side, \\"Copernicus\\" stands out as being the best of the bunch, but the lyrics are once again tiresome (\\"The solution inhaled from the rag I hold holds a maximum vacancy\\"), but really, the lyrics have always been a take-it-or-leave-it affair even since the At The Drive-In days, so it is what it is. The song is at least not bland or derivative like the other two mellow songs.    In between is \\"Halo of Nembutals\\", a track with a quiet verse and yet another De-loused chorus, it sounds best on first listen, but as you get acquainted with the structure of the album, it slowly sinks into \\"unremarkable\\" territory.     While I was excited for the idea of mellow songs from the band (almost non-existent on Bedlam), they ended up bringing the band down, in my opinion. The mindset benefits the rest of the material though, producing the most accessible songs in their catalog (and an album that won't give you a headache if you're in a bad mood). You won't find any innovation or progression from the sound they've been shaping for their whole career, but you will enjoy it if you give it a chance. Worst-case scenario, you wait another 1-2 years for the next album, if their impressive output-rate is any indication.
B000056JYC|5.0|It's been a long time since I've heard the original Frampton Comes Alive.  My vinyl copy was lost in a flood and I decided it was time to restore Frampton Comes Alive to my CD collection.  I decided to take a chance with the \\"new, improved\\" edition, despite comments to the contrary (notably about the added tracks).  I'm very glad I went with the 25th anniversary edition.  The altered tracking and added material fills out what had been more of a collection of live cuts.  The new release pulls the \\"show\\" into a cohesive program.  The re-engineering is as good as anything re-engineered and in release now.  Even that darn firecracker in Wind of Change sounds sharper.  All in all, the 25th anniversary version of this classic is a pleasant surprise.
B000065LZE|4.0|Mainly I wanted to report that the sound quality was very good.    I purchased this CD used for my daughter. It's very good musicianship, although the composition it isn't entirely my cup of tea.    FYI: I am a record collector of 55 years and a sometimes deejay.
965006026X|2.0|While this is a work of unquestioned and towering achievement, it has a couple of things going against it.  First, the pagination of this edition is not consistent with Keynes own internal reference to the pages of his original edition, which makes it confusing, and the editorial quality is abysmal. Typos on every page, bar none.    The more important critique, though, is that this is as difficult a read as any book outside those which cover the physical sciences.  It is simply impenetrable for the lay person.  Trust me on this.      I feel proud to have read, so far, up to page 275, over 6 weeks, but I actually get much more out of reading the summary of keynesianism in wikipedia than the book itself.  Sometimes, in fact, as I read this I think that one of the problems with policymakers who have embraced this school (and I am not sure if I am one of them) is that they simply don't understand it as Keynes elucidated it.  Perhaps they don't need to, but I don't know, it just nags at me.    Buy another edition for your bookshelf, just to have such a towering work, but I wouldn't necessarily read the thing.....
B000GUJYRE|3.0|at my age, having listened to classical music more or less continuously for over half a century, if i am going to embrace a new complete set of beethoven symphonies, then there must be a vision or spirit in it that i haven't already encountered in the recordings of karajan, bohm, szell, gardiner, harnoncourt, kleiber or abbado.<br /><br />the haitink/LSO performances struck me as very professional, very fulsomely and attentively played, and very average. haitink manages to make a recording of each symphony that seems to crib the best from every other interpretation and add nothing to the amalgam but polish. the sonics are acceptable given that these are live recordings, but there is a feeling of \\"been there, done that\\" in the experience. as haitink is near the end of his career i think critics have been appreciative of these performances in a commemorative spirit.<br /><br />it's significant that many of the reviews here, including the amazon.com review, basically praise this set in contrast to haitink's previous recordings, as if this new issue were a do over or we are expected to appreciate the improvement rather than the achievement. i think any second rank american conductor could do as well or better with the LSO to follow him, and i mean a native born american conductor just to limit the field.<br /><br />at this point i'd be in favor of a 30 year moratorium on new beethoven symphony recordings: play them live, keep the great existing recordings in print ... but don't make me listen to the committee consensus ideal of beethoven as something \\"new\\". this set is more about marketing and giving a hardworking, talented but not groundbreaking conductor his well earned career due. it is not among the sets i can enjoy hearing for their life and originality.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I was a big Michael Jackson fan when a kid with my brother. I wasn't huge later on still some of my favorite songs were his; but until his death I admit I took him and his uncanny talent for granted. And forgot so many songs!     THIS ALBUM - Although missing some big songs (Scream anyone??????) It's LIGHTYEARS from Number Ones. HOWEVER -     A lot of these songs are EDITED (single versions) - not all - but songs like \\"Will You Be There\\" (no poem reading at end), \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"Black or White\\" (no intro). Now truth be told; diehards may not like this. Imo not too much is lost such as Black or White, I don't need to hear the Dad and kid opening everytime it plays. HOWEVER - other songs like \\"Will You Be There\\" personally; although the end drags out MJ reading the poem piece is so moving. I love it.     So to most people it won't matter a whole lot; what's taken out is mostly the album version intros and endings. Just be warned for that.
6305428425|5.0|I'm going to reiterate what a previous reviewer stated and say I absoulutely love this movie.  This isn't the end all or be all of high school reunion flicks but a gentle lampooning on the genre.  To take it as some profound statement about going home again would do the film a disservice.  The soundtrack here is impeccable.  Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino, two of the top comediennes of the previous decade, have chemistry to burn.  To boot you have Alan Cumming, one of the great British funnymen, as the object of Kudrow's affection.  Irresistable is an understatement.
B00164GDD2|4.0|I saw \\"Ghostbusters\\" two years ago in Seattle at the Cinerama. It was a 70mm projection and gorgeous! Of course there was plenty of dirt, scratches etc. It was an old film print. Very well loved! And still the projection of film was a real treat!     Now comes \\"Ghostbusters\\" on blu-ray. The transfer looks almost as good as the 70mm version I saw at Cinerama. Maybe better. The transfer is clean. No scratches. No dirt. Many shots have a 3-D quality. Including shots of the gargoyle statues. The Stay Puft Marshmellow Man hasn't looked so good. The only noticable issue is grain. Grain is good. This makes a movie retain its original theatrical look.    Many customers will argue the transfer is so grainy it's unwatchable. Untrue! You will be disappointed if you're looking for a Lowry Digital 4k restoration transfer or if you compare this to any Bond Blu-ray or other modern films, you will be sad! \\"Ghostbusters\\" is a product of 1980s  with use of heavy grain film stock. My \\"Donnie Darko\\" Blu-ray is a worse transfer than \\"Ghostbusters\\". All of the optical shots are clean and vivid. This is a great Blu-ray and recently one of my favorites! I even compared the DVD and obviously, 480i does not stand a chance to 1080p. The Blu-ray is much superior!     Don't listen to others complaining about grain. This was shot on film in 1984!!! There is bound to be loads of grain. And the worst parts of noticeable grain happen in the first moments.  The rest is nothing. Sony did a great job with the solid transfer. The special features are alright. Nothing to write home about.

0385340990|4.0|I have just completed the most charming, most delectable book this year.  The book's format is in epistolary style and is both informative, as well as entertaining.  The characters, herein, will touch each reader with their warmth, their spirit, their tolerance, their unity, their ability to triumph during one of our history's darkest period.<br /><br />It will cure whatever ails you.  It is a fabulous book to have handy - especially if you, like me, are attracted to `dark' books.  It is simply a wonderful antidote to those reads.  I admit that every so often, I tend to overdo those `dark' books.<br /><br />Juliet will make you smile, laugh aloud and touch your heart, as will [almost] the entire cast of characters in `The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.' Additionally, Juliet's letters contain a marvelous wit and are abundant with contagious buoyancy.  This is bound to be a major favorite among book clubs.<br /><br />Okay, why not give this 5 stars?  While I very much enjoyed this book, it is a predictable one.  It terms of 'good cheer,' it is a 5 star book.  It terms of reality, I would love to believe that these events occurred.  Alas, it is a novel and a very entertaining one at that!<br />[4+]
B0026RHR6K|5.0|Fifty years ago, humanity's robotic servant Cylons suddenly turned on their masters. After a nasty war, the Cylons retreated into far space and a tense truce was maintained.<br /><br />But of course the story doesn't stop -- and it turned out to be a rare case of a remake becoming spectacularly better than the source material. \\"Battlestar Galactica - The Complete Series\\" is a grimy, dark, violent and ultimately hopeful sci-fi adventure saga that isn't afraid to dip into philosophical and theological matters. And while it has its ups and downs like any series, it's a brilliant and powerful piece of work.<br /><br />Forty years after the war's end, the Cylons unexpectedly return to the Twelve Colonies and start wiping out ships and cities. The Battlestar Galactica (an aging warship about to be turned into a museum) is forced to flee the world of Caprica with a collection of refugee-crammed ships, under the command of Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) and Secretary of Education-turned-President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell).<br /><br />Now the people of the Twelve Colonies must find a new home -- and their new goal is Earth, a legendary planet with other humans on it. Unfortunately, they have been infiltrated by the treacherous scientist Gaius Baltar (James Callis), and a group of Cylons who are almost indistinguishable from human beings -- they even have emotions and can interbreed with humans.<br /><br />But the journey is the real test: sabotage, assassination attempts, betrayals, shortages of water, food and fuel, the introduction of cruel martial law, religious conflict, the discovery of another surviving Battlestar called the Pegasus, and the overhanging fear of infiltration by the humanoid Cylons. And though they find a habitable (but miserable) planet, soon the ragtag fleet is forced to flee again -- and eventually discover that their goal is not what they hoped...<br /><br />Anyone expecting \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" to be a copy of its predecessor is going to be horribly disappointed. This is sci-fi at its most compelling and transcendent -- a gritty, bleak, dark story of war and desperate escapes, and there are plenty of moral dilemmas (Roslin ordering the death of a baby Cylon/human hybrid). And it explores the truly compelling questions about what it is to be human and alive -- and to deserve to be.<br /><br />And the writers brilliantly wrap together hard SF with threads of mystical science fiction, and undertones of religion and philosophy. The writing is solid and snappy (\\"Old gods die hard\\") and even manages to pull off dramatic and powerful dialogue without being cheesy (\\"She chose me. Chose me over all men. Chosen to be seduced. Taken by the hand. Guided between the Light and the Dark\\").<br /><br />And each character is given an intricate and complex journey to follow, filled with pain, death, sorrow and slowly moving beyond their own personal problems. Friendships are pulled apart, alliances are formed, and lots of horrible and morally questionable choices are made. Some of these people are redeemed, some are destroyed, and some discover that they are not even human.<br /><br />Olmos and McDonnell are the powerful leaders in this story, and both actors do a brilliant job -- especially Mcdonnell with Roslin's breast cancer, and Olmos with his tragic past. Other standouts: Callis as the ever-changing Baltar, Michael Hogan as the unlikeable Saul Tigh, and Grace Park as a humanoid Cylon whose love changes her goals.<br /><br />But the true standouts here are Katee Sackhoff as Kara Thrace (aka \\"Starbuck\\") and Tricia Helfer as the ethereal humanoid-Cylon Number Six. Both women's fates are intertwined with the search for Earth, and it's fascinating to see how they shape the show. Sackhoff's character in particular comes across as annoyingly more-macho-than-thou at first, but the slow evolution into \\"harbinger of death\\" and destiny makes her the most compelling of all.<br /><br />The complete box set is goingto apparently include relatively few extras -- it obviously has all the seasons included along with assorted extended episodes, promotional stuff for the prequel spinoff \\"Caprica,\\" deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes stuff, interviews, and so on and so forth.

B001MYIXAC|2.0|Ok, I saw the original translation version of this movie, which apparently gives much more impact to the subtitles in the movie and better conveys the content of the dialogue. The movie was not boring, though it is slow-paced, and did have a decent level of depth to the characters, however upon researching some of the allegory regarding Eli's gender \\"issues\\" I eventually found out that Eli is a boy (albeit a castrated one - This scene is only in the book and is hinted at but never stated directly in the movie.  There is one line and one scene that give this info but they are not 100% concrete), and Oskar knows this, which makes their pseudo-romantic relationship homosexual.  While this is not outside the realm of reason for vampires (Anne Rice novels for example), and in a way gives a little credibility to Oskar for accepting Eli as-is (this is a big point to the story), I'm more than a bit put-off by it.  Really the only things new are child vampire (though technically that was covered in Interview With the Vampire) focus and the sexuality issues of one. Bleh... Spend your time on better vampire movies.  This is overhyped nonsense.
B001TH16DI|5.0|A great and complete collection of the original 6 Star Trek Si-Fi movies.  Amazon had this collection for 40% less than [...]  If you're a Star Trek fan then this is a must buy.  Picture quality was just as good as my other Blu-Ray movies.  I highly recommend this item.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I had seen this once at my sister's house so I requested it from the library and then proceeded to wait as I dropped from number 22 in line!  The library only had videos too.  I found it for a great price, ordered it and have so much enjoyed the Pride & Prejudice story as told through Amanda's eyes.  I didn't know what to expect and was thoroughly pleased with it.  It is well done and faithful to the original while working with the modern girl thrown in.  I know that it is extremely popular since I was still number 9 in line at the library when I got it in the mail!  Well worth the purchase price and something I can watch over and over!!

B00000F14B|5.0|...that this is a \\"Dawn of DVD\\" product. That is, it was one of the first films ever released on DVD. I bought this product when it first came out, so I've had it for over ten years. Back in 1999 we were just all awestruck by the fact that a movie would fit on something smaller than a brick (VHS) and might even have room for and contain a featurette. In this case your extra feature is the featurette \\"Right Here in River City: The Making of Meredith Willson's The Magic Man\\". There are also two trailers, and that is it.<br /><br />Looking at the film today, this disc is a dinosaur. The colors seem runny and the hue a bit off, and the sound is rather uneven. The disc can often be had for a greatly reduced price, and the quality is probably the reason why. This film is ripe for a redo and most probably a Blu-Ray release, so I would save my money until that time, if I was you.<br /><br />As far as the film itself as art, it is one of the great musical motion pictures. I can't imagine anyone but Robert Preston as fast-talking fast-thinking Professor Harold Hill, and then there's my favorite line in the film as spoken by the mayor \\"And now I'd like to present a spectacle - my wife.\\" The music is wonderful and memorable, and the whole thing just captures small-town life at the beginning of the twentieth century in such a charming way. I've liked this film since I was in my 20's, back when I thought that \\"The Terminator\\" was classic cinema.<br /><br />In summary, I couldn't recommend the film more highly, but as for the DVD I'd wait until Warner Home Video comes out with an upgraded product. One is long overdue.
B000654YS8|2.0|First  clip was a lip sinc disaster. All had instruments playing on stage to the studio recording.The next set wasnt much better.2nd was live footage with studio recording mixed in with obvious timing mishaps. Other clips were basic MTV type videos and other bad retake sing alongs.<br />Great Music but not for sitting down to watch and enjoy.<br />Better off buying the music CD and having cartoons on the TV with the TV volume off.

0060765380|2.0|The story is just too convoluted. I guess in reality, it could be a 3, but alas, I was not feeling generous. Mr. Rollins is an excellent writer. He does his research, creates likeable and interesting characters, and his stories typically flow with ease. I could not wait to finish this book ... and not because it was so intriguing. I simply wanted it to be over so I could move on to something else. Although most of the characters are strong, the story drags them down.<br /><br />Bottom line: Skip this one.

B00268EVL8|1.0|The Kindle version of this book needs some serious editing.  The book must have been scanned then OCR'ed because there are typos on almost every page, some pages have many.  This is usually only irritating, but occasionally I have to reread a sentence several times to parse out where the periods or other punctuation should be.  It's especially irritating that one of the main characters of the book is named Karla and this can come up as Karia, Kar1a, Kar a, or who knows how many other variations.  These problems really interrupt the flow and joy of reading this book.  It's a really bad version.<br /><br />The exact same problems appear on both the dedicated Kindle reader and the iPhone Kindle application so I don't think it's a download problem.<br /><br />The book itself is spectacular and I highly recommend it for all the reasons given in the other reviews.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|I want to make a point not just about 'From the Earth to the Moon' screen aspect ratio, but for many modern TV presentations that seem to be 'modified' when released on DVD.  It is a common practice these days for film makers to opt for both ratios.      Larry David did it with 'Seinfeld'.  Though shot originally in 4:3 ratio the show's scenes were actually composed to suit 16:9 ratio should it be required for future TV screen ratios.  So no cutting off of heads but instead to lose some unessessary image through cropping.  Stuff you wouldn't miss unless you a the sort of person who just has to see the top and bottom of a doorway....    Let's get real and get over 4:3....Me and my Toshiba 1080p LCD have.

032147404X|3.0|How so?<br /><br />It's about the title. Rather, the title's not about what the book is about.<br /><br />Calling a book \\"The Digital Photography Book\\" suggests that it is the (or at least an) authoritative volume on the subject of digital photography. This impression is reinforced by the book's remarkable popularity. Three years after its publication it's still a bestseller, ranked 390 on Amazon's overall list as of the date of this writing.<br /><br />So what's the problem?<br /><br />It's far from authoritative and it's not really focused on digital photography.<br /><br />Rather than being a comprehensive treatment, the book is a series of tips under general headings such as \\"Shooting Flowers Like a Pro\\", \\"Shooting Weddings Like a Pro\\", \\"Pro Tips for Getting Really Sharp Photos\\", and so on. There's nothing really wrong with this except that most are not really about digital photography.<br /><br />For instance under \\"Shooting Flowers Like a Pro\\", there are sections such as \\"Don't Shoot Down on Flowers\\", \\"Use a Macro Lens to Get Really Close\\", \\"Don't Wait for Rain - Fake It\\", and amazingly, \\"Where to Get Great Flowers to Shoot\\".<br /><br />All of this is well and good, but it has nothing to do with digital as opposed to film or general photography.  If you think that the faking rain section deals with the use of Photoshop to add an effect of rain, you'd be wrong. What the author is suggesting is carrying a small spray bottle of H2O to physically spritz on the posies prior to shooting.<br /><br />Hmmm.<br /><br />In addition, there are some serious omissions.<br /><br />Kelbey starts off the \\"Shooting People Like a Pro\\" section with a discussion of \\"The Best Lens for Portrait Photography\\".<br /><br />In it he makes the point that many pros consider 85 MM as the optimal focal length for portraits. While this may be true when shooting 35mm film or an FX sensor digital body, it is not the case for DX, used by the great majority of digital shooters. But worse yet, the whole issue of sensor size and its implications is not addressed anywhere in the book.<br /><br />If you're interested in a sampling of snippets on various photographic subject matters by all means buy this book.<br /><br />But if you're a competent film photographer looking to transition to digital, keep on looking.  Complete Digital Photography by Ben Long is a far better choice.k.    If you're interested in a sampling of snippets on various photographic subject matters by all means buy this book.

B0001KZM3O|5.0|I just started listening to Pink Floyd, about four months ago and I just can't get over THE WALL classic.  I do have THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, but personally I prefer THE WALL.  Probably because the whole concept of, \\"isolation.\\"  Which I felt in middle school at times.  I do have friends though, but they listen to POP and all the other popular genres of music.    First of all, if you don't have the rock-opera THE WALL you are probably  not going to like this album.  This album isn't amiable.  Let me get that straight.  Many Pink Floyd fans may consider this crap, simply because this album doesn't have an amiable sound.  But, you've got to look at the other side of THE WALL.  This album is basically a tribute album to Roger Water's father, who died during WORLD WAR II.  Many people probably don't know that.  There are lots of refriences to WORLD WAR II, in fact in THE WALL.     Roger Waters made a decision to produce a album about Anti-war after the Falklands War occured between United Kingdom and Argentina.  Margaret Thatcher (Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time), who Roger Waters thought wasted British lives and bearing hundreds of teenage Angentine lives after a Angentina Cruiser was sunk.  She (Margaret Thatcher) did this, according to Waters, to improve her policital standing.  This sparked the fire, to produce a concept album about Anti-war.                Some of the songs I found, that were exceptional are \\"The Gunners dream\\" about a dying pilot laying on a field dreaming about peace to arise and war, murders, and all the other issue's to dissappear.  That's a pretty good clue for the songs meaning, if you have the lyics.  \\"The Final Cut,\\" was another song I really enjoyed.  I think it's about a kid with very low self-a-steam, and if you listen closly at the end of the song the kid almost commits suicide, but a phone call prevented that from occuring.      I'm sure most people don't get far, before throwing the album or CD into the dust.  I mean look at all the one-star reviews...  It's sad, that many people can't acknowledge what Roger Waters was trying to convey.  Yes, it is like an Roger Waters solo album, but there were a couple of songs where Roger Waters worked with other members of the band.       This is Pink Floyd's most touching album, by far.  The song that really touched me was,\\"When the Tigers Broke free,\\" about how Roger Waters father (Eric Fletcher) died during the battle near the beaches Anzio, Italy where they landed.  It's very sad because the whole company, company C, died when fighting against one of the best tanks during that time, tiger tanks.  What they were doing was liberating Rome from German control.         I rate this album pretty high,even though its not popular, 9.0/10.  Very touching, fine album.  This album will send many of you crying in your sleep.

Cinematography : AWESOME!!   I Think that the movie itself could have been a bit more intense, yet less dramatic..~ >in special effects .  Aboriginal stories here are just as heartwrenching as the Native American stories.. and unfortunatly went on for a whole lot longer !  It was a great concept, but lacked the finese of a GREAT movie.  If you havent visited Australia, the country, look at the movie and know it's REALLY just like that!   If you want to know more about its history >> read a few books, or ask aboriginal peoples!

0446402397|5.0|\\"Child 44\\" is the debut novel by Tom Rob Smith, and is exciting, intense, and impossible to put down.<br /><br />It is set in Stalinist Russia in the U.S.S.R. in 1953. That brings to the reader of a certain age a vivid memory of stories of Gulags, Siberian exile, Secret Police, the persecution of religion and finally, the complete paranoia ingrained in a people raised to denounce others to the State and fear being denounced themselves.<br /><br />The feeling of the claustrophobia in the Soviet Society, the fact that at any time one can \\"disappear\\", that one must take care never to say anything that may be misconstrued even to one's closest friends and family, are brought to life with the sense that the author lived it.<br /><br />Leo Stepanovich Demidov is a moderately high ranking member of MGB, the Secret Police.  He is an agent.  He follows people, learns their secrets, and arrests them if there is any suspicion of anti-Soviet actions or opinions. He also follows up denouncements: interrogating people, beating or torturing them if necessary and when their confession is ultimately obtained, as it always is, then the person is executed, or in some cases sent to Siberia or to prison.<br /><br />At the same time Leo is a loving son, proud that his good job gives them every perk of the Soviet State: an apartment with running water and indoor toilet facilities, an apartement they do not have to share with others, relatively easy jobs,and access to better food.  Likewise, Leo and his wife Raisa, a teacher, live in an equally nice apartment.  They can shop in stores that the average Soviet citizen cannot.  Leo seems to be a decent man trapped in a society that is twisted and evil, but whose rules and laws he follows as a loyal citizen.<br /><br />Leo and Raisa are decent people.  Leo's parents are very warm and sympathetic elders who have lived a long, hard life and now finally and for the first time ever, living with in a safe, warm apartment with enough  to eat and warm clothes....a paradise to people of that nation.<br /><br />Like one of those Russian dolls, where each one contains yet another one inside...the novel grows and develops as one simple event leads Leo to--perhaps for the first time--have doubts about his profession and his country's policies.<br /><br />Subplots, which initally seem unimportant and unrelated, become powerful and cause changes that are permanent.  Leo comes to a decision,  which if he chooses one way, will end all of the benefits of the good life he, his wife and parents have.<br /><br />There is also, initially as a subplot, a murdered child.  This becomes the sole obsession of Leo, though pursuing it goes against all the beliefs of his culture and breaks its'laws.  In Soviet Russia the officially decreed line was that through Marxism/Communism the nation was growing in maturity and that therefore murder, crimes, social deviance of any kind, could no longer exist due to the perfection of the State.<br /><br />To claim that a serial murderer of children was at work in the U.S.S.R. was to be a proponent of anti-Soviet propaganda, and a tool of the West.<br /><br />I won't go further as I don't want to give away the plot of the outcome. This was an excellent book, hard to put down, very consuming, believable  and one that stays with you after it's over.e of that nation.

He's crazy (in a good way) - and this book sounded crazy, so I picked it up.<br /><br />I run as part of my exercise routine, and have tackled with injuries on and off like everyone... and this book was a paradigm shifter for me. I ran for the first time today WITHOUT my fancy expensive shoes, and it is a completely different experience affecting my entire body. And if the story line in this book had not been so entertaining, interesting, and inspiring - I would have not even attempted to make such a drastic change to my weekly \\"routine\\" of running.<br /><br />Running has always been a \\"task\\" for me - to keep in shape, because \\"I should\\" do it.  This book gives you a completely different outlook on running, some incredible running cultures, and challenges a lot of beliefs that we all hold as \\"true\\" about running.  I threw away my Nike gear after I was done.  And I had more fun running today, in a completely different way, than I've ever had running before.<br /><br />I never thought running would be fun.

B001LV5OOY|4.0|The UK is fertile grounds for a seemingly never-ending supply of the latest \\"it\\" rock bands. If it's not, say, the Kooks one year, it's Arctic Monkeys another year, or, say, White Lies this year. The UK trio appeared pretty much out of nowhere in early 2008 with an intruiging EP, \\"Unfinished Business\\". The band went to work on its debut album and ahead of that in the Fall released the single \\"Death\\". The rest is, as they say, history. The debut album crashed in at No. 1 in the UK album charts.<br /><br />\\"White Lies\\" (10 tracks; 45 min.) starts off with that first single \\"Death\\" (1st UK single), which is a nice enough tune. Better still is the next track \\"To Lose My Life\\" (2nd UK single). \\"A Place to Hide\\" is perhaps the best example of why White Lies are called the 'new' Joy Division. \\"Unfinished Business\\" 9from that same EP) closes a nice first half of the album. The second half of the album kicks off with a thunderous \\"E.S.T.\\", which is followed by a somber \\"From the Stairs\\" (reminding me of latter-days Ultravox). \\"Farewell TO the Fairground\\" (3rd UK single) is my favorite track on the album, with stomping bass and drums, just great.<br /><br />In all, this is a nice debut album, no question.  There are a number of stellar highlights on here. But that said, I must admit I have a hard time understanding all the hoopla that this album caused in the UK. White Lies is scheduled to open for Kings On Leon on the pending Fall US tour, and I can't wait to see how these songs and this band resonate in a live setting.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I love this program, and I have often watched it, both on videotape (mine was starting to flip from wear, so I purchased the DVD) and on DVD.  For Americans who saw this on PBS, a pleasant surprise is that there are speeches and brief scenes on the BBC DVD sold on Amazon that were never aired on PBS!  Some of those are relevant; for example, Mary asks Ms. Pole what her cousin (the Michael Gambon character) did after Miss Mattie refused  him. We learn on the DVD he avoided Cranford for 30 years. I'm sure that section of the scene was deleted on PBS's version.  There are numerous other scenes like that throughout this set.  If you are NOT the type of person to like period dramas set in 1800's England villages, this is not the series for you.  But while I admit I doubt I'd enjoy Gaskell's books upon which the series is based (I was not too excited by Doctor Harrison's romance, for example), this series is SO well-acted, paced, scored, and written that it is an absolute delight!  I highly recommend it. Fans will be pleased to know a 2-hour sequel has already been filmed for release in America on PBS in 2010. Carl Davis is releasing the soundtrack, at least in Britain, in October 2009 (according to his website).
B001SO69IY|5.0|This cd is great redman and methodman showed everybody that ten years is nothin in there case. They came back better than ever this cd is a platinum cd it should not go gold. I say if this cd goes gold and not platinum fans let them down. there frist cd balckout 1 went platinum so this one is real good to.  I like to say for it being ten years since there frist blackout redman and methodman lost nothing they have the same swager for ten years. To tell you they truth if redman and methodman didnt make a new cd in 20 years they still be the same nothing want change with them.   To everybody buy the cd  its all worth it you will enjoy this cd a lot every song keeps you into the cd and wonder what redman and mathodman may do next on the cd. they are on top like they were ten years ago with balckout 1. Blackout 2 is classic and keep this with you when you buy it.

With MJ appearing on stage and standing as still as a statue.  The crowd is going wild.  I've never seen so many people at one gathering.  This concert leaves you in awe of Michael Jackson.  The music is good, the performance is outstanding.  You feel like you're there and you can't turn away.  Worth having in your collection.
B000065V9Y|5.0|Quite simply, this is one of the most heartfelt, mystical, magical, majestic, touched-by-god albums I have ever heard.  When I read reviews like Mr. Stewart's, I honestly believe the writer must live only in the head and not the heart, and that's a shame.  So many beautiful tracks, but I will never forget the magic of listening for almost three straight minutes to Gabriel singing about water...and more water...and more water...until he 'slips up' and one word about a woman slips out--and then the metaphorical dam bursts.  \\"Washing Of The Water\\" alone makes this album worth not only the money, but worth its weight in gold.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I own the earlier Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciarin Hinds. It's beautifully acted and filmed.  This version fell flat for me very quickly.  I like Penry-Jones in Spooks and the BBC's Cambridge Spies immensely. I did not care for him in this role. I can't pin down exactly why, but I simply didn't feel he was right for the part....to distant, unemotional, even nonverbally, facially. Granted, Hinds, who can be explosive when he acts, was also very contained, but Jones here did NOT come across as contained, rather as nonresponsive much of this film.  Overall, I felt none of the actors were that strong; the pacing also dragged with this version to me. If you want the film, buy the earlier BBC Persuasion!

B00005K3O4|5.0|Released in 1988 Killer Klowns from Outer Space gives you a 50's style drive in quality that nothing can match. It is simply one of the most bizarre films (in a good way) I have seen in my history of film watching. It's one of those movies that's best seen after midnight on tv during those countless hours of strange programming. Thanks to some stellar b writing by Charles & Edward Chiodo we have been given one of horror/sci-fi's best b efforts to date.<br /><br />We start off when a group of aliens, that resemble earth's version of clowns, land in the town of Crescent Cove. Once they have landed in the middle of the woods the ship takes the form of a circus tent. Our main characters Mike and Debbie are out on a date and stumble across the hidden tent. Since they think it's strange that a circus is held in the middle of nowhere they decide to check it out. While they're poking around they run into our giant headed clown friends that shoot at them with a popcorn bazooka, barely escaping.<br /><br />Once back into town they go to the police with their strange discovery but kid hating Sgt. Mooney thinks they're on drugs pulling some prank. Shortly after the clowns make their way through Crescent Cove and begin capturing the townspeople turning them into cotton candy cocoons. Once it becomes known something's wrong Mike and friends take action by going back to the tent for a final showdown with the aliens. Unfortunately they have to face  a hidden giant clown, but manage to get out alive.<br /><br />Killer Klowns from Outer Space has everything I look for in a campy b movie. It really is one of the essentials sitting high on my list of films in the category of \\"so bad it's good.\\" I couldn't imagine someone watching this and not getting a kick out of it. Just by looking at it you'd have to know to expect nothing more then a over the top horror-comedy. I 100% recommend this one to the fans in the world of b. Odds are you've seen it already, but if not then check it out as soon as possible.
B000ION23A|5.0|My 4.5 year-old preschooler loves \\"The Ant Bully\\", and this is one of the few kid movies that I actually enjoy watching with her [we've watched it over 5 times now]. The animation is great, and the story too has a lot to recommend it. The story centers around a young boy, Lucas [Zach Tyler] who is constantly being bullied by an older and bigger neighborhood bully. Lucas in turn vents his anger and frustration on the ant colony in his yard. Typical of animated movies, the ants can 'talk' - there's Zoc [Nicolas Cage] a sort of ant wizard who experiments with a shrinking potion, his girlfriend Hova [Julia Roberts] who believes that \\"Peanut the Destroyer\\" aka Lucas is good at heart and that humans and ants can co-exist in peace. Lucas inevitably gets shrunk to ant size [well, a little smaller actually] and is sentenced by the Queen [Meryl Streep] to live and work in the ant colony, learning to 'become' an ant with the hope that Lucas will learn compassion. Over the course of the movie, Lucas learns that ants too have 'feelings' and that his actions of bullying the ants was not justified in any way - in fact, Lucas comes to form a real friendship with the ants.<br /><br />A story with a positive message and wonderful animation, with lots of humor throughout - perfect for kids and adults alike. Highly recommended as a family movie.
0061474355|4.0|If you're a fan of young adult fantasy - particularly in the darker vein of Jonathan Stroud's Bartimaeus Triology or Susan Cooper's Dark Is Rising series - you'll want to add Garth Nix's Sabriel to your collection.<br /><br />The story follows a fairly typical outline: our young heroine is thrust out of her safe, comfortable world at school and into a quest to rescue her father and thwart those bent on death and destruction. But the world Nix has created is utterly unique: one in which the living and the dead frequently cross paths, and necromancers (like our heroine and her father) struggle to banish life-sucking spirits. And Nix doesn't waste space on back-story information dumps: he thrusts you into the action and dares you to keep up.
0553381687|5.0|This is an incredible book.  The author really expresses feeling and draws you in.  I would recommend this series (A Song of Ice and Fire) to anyone who enjoys midevil battles, politics and intrigue.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this book - the first of the series.
B0000691TJ|5.0|This was everything I expected and more!  Bonus songs included on this expanded edition.  I got the cd just a few days after I ordered it!  It rocks, gotta hear it again today!
B001LHMW8Y|5.0|There is not ONE song on this album that isnt amazing.  She has great style, crazy but great, her songs are catchy, her videos are always entertaining, and she can sing live. I can't wait till she comes up with a new album
B000002GJH|5.0|If you like Pearl Jam or any of Chris Cornell's projects (Soundgarden, Audioslave, solo work), then this CD is for you. Started as a tribute to singer Andrew Wood after he died of an overdose, Temple of the Dog might be the best work any member of the group has ever produced.<br /><br />Participants include then-Soundgarden-members Chris Cornell (vocals) and Matt Cameron (drums), as well as four future founding members of Pearl Jam: Eddie Vedder (vocals), Mike McCready (lead guitar), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar), and Jeff Ament (bass)<br /><br />Cornell wrote all of the lyrics and nearly all of the music, and his voice is at its peak on this album, with the standout being the ear-shattering ending of Say Hello 2 Heaven. Vedder mostly provides backing vocals on a few songs, but his duet with Cornell on Hunger Strike makes it a classic.<br /><br />Musically, the album spans a diverse range from straight-up hard rock (Pushin' Forward Back, Your Savior) to piano-filled bluesy rock (Call Me A Dog, All Night Thing) to grunge epics (Reach Down, Four Walled World). Throw in some harmonica (Times of Trouble) and banjo (Wooden Jesus), and this album has just about everything.<br /><br />Special mention goes to Mike McCready, whose solos on Say Hello 2 Heaven, Call Me A Dog, and especially Reach Down (all 4 or 5 minutes worth) rank among his best ever. Matt Cameron also deserves extra points for his funky beats in Your Savior.<br /><br />Basically, this album is a must-own for any rock fan. There isn't a bad song on it, and there are several masterpieces. I can listen to this over and over without ever getting tired of it.
B00006AW2G|5.0|the rolling stones let it bleed is one of their best albums ever,let it bleed was released in december of 1969 which unfortuneatly was the year guitarist and founding member brian jones died shortly after being asked to leave the band for many personal reasons bettween, brian,mick and kieth..when brian left the stones hired mick taylor as new lead guitarist and did the very succesful let it bleed tour..also on that very same tour of 1969 the stones gave the infamous free concert at altamont speedway in northern california and hired the hell,s angels as security!!!!needless to say that was a bad decision and strangely enough when they played sympathy for the devil the angels killed meredith hunter.however the album,s fine points are,gimme shelter,midnight rambler,let it bleed,live with me and you can,t always get what you want this album is a must for any stones fan!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The are any number of books out there detailing a soldier's experience, but there are very few that can really capture the essence of a country and her people in a time of war.  This is one of them.  The author managed to deftly interweave the story of a war torn country and the delicate & conflicted lives of those who lived it.      The book was thoroughly enjoyable, and is well worth a read.  After I finished the book, I couldn't help but feel slightly humbled by the experience.
078322737X|4.0|Although I have heard about American Graffiti for many years, I had never seen it until now.<br /><br />It is a teenage coming of age show set in a small California town in the early 1960s.  It features Curt Henderson (Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) as best friends who are getting ready to go off to college together.  They have lots of second thoughts and relationship issues to sort through.  There are lots of typical teenager type situations throughout - car chases, breakups, etc.  It is really a fun show to watch.<br /><br />In addition to the storyline, there is a lot of great classic music and some future big stars getting a start besides Dreyfuss (Ron Howard was already well known from his childhood series work).  Others who are in this include Suzanne Somers and Harrison Ford.  The legendary disk jockey Wolfman Jack also fills a cameo role.<br /><br />Although I may have never gotten around to watching this movie if it wasn't in my Netflix queue, I am glad that I did.  It is really a good time.
0679805273|5.0|This is a great book, it gives encouragement to all ages.  It talks about making life decisions and making smart choices.  I would suggest this book to anyone.
B00006AW2M|4.0|the rolling stones their satanic majesties request is an odd but very cool psychedelic record for it,s time and now,the stones released this record towards the end of 1967 which was a very cool year in rock music history,at the time this album was released there were inevetable comparisons to the beatles sgt peppers which also was released that same year.satanic majesties was critized by some fans and the music press as sounding half baked and unlike the stones trademark sound,there are some strange cuts on it like gomper,sing this alltogether and in another land,but for me the coolest cuts are,2000 light years from home,2000 man,citadel,she,s a rainbow and the lantern. as a stones fan and psychedelic music i would get this cd,and the cover is one of the coolest in rock!!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This was a father's day gift for my husband.  He was very pleased with the quality of this series, and happy with the gift.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|If you own a blu-ray player, you should own this.  The IMAX scenes in particular look fantastic, probably the most impressive HD stuff I've seen on blu thus far.  The opening sequence is the perfect way to show off your rig to somebody unacquainted with blu-ray.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it's about as good as action films are going to get.  It's not perfect (*cough* Maggie Gyllenhaal) and I noticed some plot holes/quirks the second time around, but it's an A-rate film nonetheless.  Recommended.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|The best thing about this DVD turned out to be the \\"extras\\". Damien Rice performs the film's theme sound \\"The Blower's Daughter\\", a beautiful MTV type clip set on an ocean beach. Damien serenades a beautiful woman, with \\"unrequited love\\" written all over it.    The four actors in this DVD are great on their own, in other films. Closer, however, proved to me that great actors can deliver stilted, awkward lines if a script is poorly written enough, and if the direction also adds salt (to the wound). These four very handsomely, beautiful people end up acting out a \\"modern love story\\" so neurotic that the-new-twist-on-the-love story just fizzles out. It wasn't so bad that I stopped watching it, though, I did laugh at the unbelievably artificial lines.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I own way too many cds- that said, this is quickly becoming one of my favorites. It contains almost all of the Franki Valli songs that my dad loved when I was a kid. The recordings are very clean. I really love this album.
B001CXWWBE|5.0|After using on-board NICs in mainstream to high end motherboards, I keep turning back to this intel gigabit NIC.  The drivers are great and the card is rock solid stable.  Highly recommended if you have an extra PCI-e slot and are tired of dealing with less than stellar adapters built into your motherboard.
0307454541|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is not exactly the girl next door.  She's a bit on the scary side, (a lot on the scary side for some people), but you'd never guess that from looking at her. She's anti-social and looks anorexic, anti-authority and oh, yeah, she's smarter than you are.<br /><br />I really liked this book. Lisbeth Salander is the title character and you would never invite her out for tea (she wouldn't go), if you ever happened to notice her at all, but by the end of the book, you might want to.<br /><br />The male hero character, Mikael Blomkvist is a financial journalist / playboy who finds himself on the losing end of a libel suit, so he's off to prison. He's innocent, of course, but nobody knows that because he declined to defend himself during trial.<br /><br />Shortly after his sentence is handed down, Mikael resigns from the magazine he co-founded and a stranger offers him a new job.  If he spends a year working on a 40-year-old unsolved disappearance case and writing a family history the Vangar family, Henrik Vangar will help his magazine survive, and he'll give Mikael evidence to help prove his innocence. Plus enough money to make for a very comfy future.<br /><br />The supporting cast in this story have quite interesting stories themselves.  Starting with Dragan Armansky, Lisbeth's boss at the security company she sort-of, sometimes works for.  I really liked him and hope he shows up in the sequels.  Erika Berger, Mikael's BFF and business partner is sophisticated, smart and has a personal life some will scorn and some will envy.  Then, there's Henrik Vangar, elderly captain of industry who hires Blomkvist to write his family history and find out what happened to his grand-neice on one fateful day in 1966.<br /><br />I was saddened to hear the author had died after writing only two more books. His writing is very good and I'd love to have had the opportunity to read many more of his books.  As it is, I have two more books to go (one is waiting here beside me now) in this trilogy and I hope to savor every word.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book,  with a couple of caveats:  One,  there are several scenes of pretty grisly sexual violence.  If that's likely to give you nightmares or keep you awake nights, skip this book.  Two, Larsson is Swedish as is the setting of this book and most of its characters.  Street names are tongue-twisters.  Jail is spelled gaol.  These and other language/cultural differences are a bit annoying, but don't detract from the story, though. Three, the second mystery in this book is concerned with the world of finance.  For some, this information will be hard to digest.  You will probably be happy to plow through it, though as it's one of those books you really want to get into and that you hope will never end.logy and I hope to savor every word.

0944092705|4.0|I'll make this short.  This is a beautiful book, with a major exception.  The basic features/layout of the book:  the traditional left-page blank, right-page image that most photo books have, no page numbers, captions, or image titles on any of the pages.  The binding is first-rate, the fabric cover is lovely, the first and last pages of the book are protective heavy paper fabric.  The pages of the book are heavy and rough.  There is no dust jacket.  The book arrives shrink-wrapped to keep it clean.  You may want to make your own just jacket.    This book just has one major problem - the images.  The color is good and they are printed well but there are obvious 'scan lines' like the images were scanned from prints (maybe) but they were scanned at poor resolution or something.  You don't have to be a 'pixel peeper' or anything to see them either.  Some images are more obvious than others because they may have more space where the tone is consistent and so they are noticeable.  Even still, this is a nice book and the price is nice.  I bought this along with Stephen Shore's Uncommon Places which was done by Aperture and it is a better book when it comes to the printing of the actual images.  I intend to write Twin Palms about the issue.  The book was manufactured in Korea.  It is a high-quality book in the materials and construction but the actual image printing is it's downfall.  This particular edition is the 4th.  Perhaps previous editions were better.    It seems like I'm riding this book pretty hard and I guess I am.  However I still recommend this book and am glad I have it.  It really should have a dust jacket however.  To do so much on the build quality of the book and then screw up the printing is a little mystifying.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|This is one superb album.  The songs,brought to life by Emmylou's beautiful voice are a joy to listen to.  Every song on this CD is a winner but Emmylou's rendition of Tracy Chapman's \\"All That You Have Is Your Soul\\" is worth the price of the CD alone.
0805209999|5.0|[[ASIN:0805209999 The Trial]] The Trial by Franz Kafka is one of the greatest marks in the world literature. This book has two main levels of interpretation. One has to do with how social power is based on the possibility of criticism and accusation. The critical or accusatory content is less relevant than the exercise of power in the social life; the possibility of harsh punishment making the power game even more effective. The second level has to do with how someone can be completely dominated by the worries that stem from the accusatory process, Kafka enhances further the engendered personal drama by making the content of the accusation unknown. This power game has existed throughout the whole civilization, however, Franz Kafka with a touch of surrealism makes the awareness of its existence more possible to all human beings.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|It's great to see these old pals now in their 60s and enjoying themselves and still entertaining as much as ever, playing music as good as ever. It's scary to remember these guys when they first played together in a band about 45 years ago.  The two reminisce about it at length in a bonus feature on this concert DVD.    Keyboard player Chris Stainton, who was a key instrumentalist in Joe Cocker's \\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\" group in the `60s,  belongs with Clapton and Winwood, all being about the same age.  It's always good to see the three above-mentioned guys playing together, along with the rest of the group.    Song-wise, that's not a lot new but I did really appreciate Clapton giving it a go on the famous Jimi Hendrix song, \\"Voodoo Chile.\\"  The only other guitarist I've ever seen attempt Hendrix's material was the late Stevie Ray Vaughan.  Eric did just fine, too.    Don't overlook the three \\"bonus\\" songs offered.  For me, \\"Lowdown,\\" with a great a rockabilly beat, was fantastic and another example of how you can't go wrong with these old pros.
B00005MP58|5.0|If you like Jane Austen you must have this movie.  I know there are several versions on film, but this is the most authentic and best acted version out there.  The cast is wonderful, each character fully developed and honed to perfection.  The settings are also beautiful with such great attention to detail that it comes alive on film.  I have watched this many times and never tire of the romance and manners which makes it such a delight to watch.  When I am in the mood, this film is like visiting an old friend, there is the comfort of companionship, and always something new to learn.  Karen Weaver
B00004RYCR|5.0|To be honest, I have never been a big fan of Meryl Streep's obsession with perfecting foreign accents for her film roles.  It takes the focus away from her performances, which sometimes leaves me a bit \\"cold\\" and \\"detached\\".  But in \\"Bridges\\", Meryl is a wonderful Francesca, so earthy and REAL, which Meryl is not known to bring to her her roles.  This is before her Miranda role in \\"Prada\\", but that's another story.    Streep is so present in this film, you literally can reach out and feel the deep passion these two people have for each other.  As Francesca and Robert get drawn more to each other, so is the viewer toward  their relationship.  In the film's climactic scene in the pickup truck in the pouring rain, when Francesca must make a split-second decision that will make or break her for the rest of her life, she chooses family and duty over her own heart's longing and desire.  Each time the film comes to that heart-wrenching scene, I am left sobbing like a fool, and I am not easily moved by films.      \\"Bridges\\" is so well made, so quietly intense that it slowly draws you in with its power and passion.  Before you know it, you are caught in the web of the love affair between Robert and Francesca.  Eastwood's spare direction and understated portrait of Robert reflect the wise decision not to overdo it.  But it is Streep's performance that really drives the film home.  Some criticize her decision to play Francesca without a pronounced Italian accent, but I think that's a smart move not to take the focus away from the heart of her performance.      A role that every actress in Hollywood wanted and sought, Eastwood made the right choice to go with  Streep.  For once, I felt she should have won the Oscar for \\"Bridges\\", but the Hollywood community was still bent on the feeling that Streep was \\"over rewarded\\" for her past roles.  Streep was an unwilling victim of her own perfection, she was being penalized by a distorted image drawn by her peers in Hollywood.  The Oscar that year instead went to Susan Sarandon for \\"Dead Man Walking\\".  But Streep should have won.  \\"Bridges\\" is a movie that sticks with you for a long, long time, even with repeated viewings.  The film is like fine wine, it gets better with time.  Simply unforgettable!
B000X9PNOG|5.0|I will begin by saying that I bought this DVD then read the comments by reviewers on Amazon. If I had read the reviews first, I probably wouldn't have bought it and that would have been a huge mistake.  Comments relating to singing off key or not singing in time, are inaccurate and if they were correct, this concert would have not been for me. Like many artists at live concerts, Meat Loaf interprets the songs differently to what we are used to hearing on the original studio albums. Artists do this to stop boredom setting in, I believe. Some artists like The Eagles, The Doobies etc. still perform the songs exactly the way they used to in the beginning. Meat Loaf is always in control of what he is doing and is singing the notes he wants to. If his interpretations of the songs constitute singing out of tune to some people, then that is their view and possibly a bit of an insult. We must remember that Bat III was recorded not too long before this concert was, and that album is one of his best !!! He hasn't lost anything !  The introductory number (All Revved Up) is very short and Meat Loaf actually doesn't appear at all in this - that's why it is just the intro. Some people have commented that some songs are shorter than the originals - I do not have a problem with this after seeing the DVD. Full versions of all the songs in this mighty programme would see the concert go on for another half an hour !  Nice to see CC in the show. Yes, Patti Rousso is not there, but the new female artists do a more than adequate job. They are exellent singers and are not too hard on the eye either - they are not a Patti Rousso but nor is anyone else !  The duet \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" is simply beautiful and sung with incredible feeling.  My two favourite songs off Bat III sound terrific - Blind As A Bat and Bad For Good.  It is hard to compare this to the Melbourne concert with the orchestra - both are good and both are different. Having the orchestra in Melbourne meant different arrangements for some numbers. In this concert, arrangements are closer to the album versions.  The band is exellent as always. Being a modern recording, the sound and picture quality are superb as you would expect.  The 1.5 hour documentary on the second DVD is superb, giving us a look at the build up to the recording of this concert. Even with his experience, Meat Loaf still gets nervous and stressed out.  I rate this concert highly and am thrilled to see Meat Loaf perform numbes from Bat III.  (Go back to white gum Meat Loaf, the yellow-green material on display here doesn't look quite so good).
B000V86OKG|5.0|I purchased Dexter video, which I am very happy to own. I had a good experience with the seller great price timely arrival,packaged well and in great condition I recomend you buy from this seller. I would do bussiness with them in the future!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This concert was performed and recorded in 1992 with Michael Jackson at around 33 years of age and definitely in his prime.  I only bought this DVD after he passed away as I was expecting to buy a DVD of his upcoming tour as one of the shows would have been recorded for sure. After seeing this one, I too, couldn't believe I waited this long to acquire it !  Don't expect high definition sound and picture quality like some reviewers, but in saying that, the picture and sound quality of this show are more than acceptable, in fact still very good.  The line up of songs is terrific and are performed with incredible intensity and emotion. The guy definitely sings most of the songs and if there was any lip synching in parts, it was not obvious to me. I was not put off by other comments on this matter.  Yes, there are shots of people passing out and being taken away, right from the start of the first song - what a waste of money for them ! And what a crowd - massive in size and all overawed by the occasion. I actually felt these shots added interest and really helped give the viewer a feel for the whole event. The only time audience shots were a little overdone, was probably during \\"Man In The Mirror\\" at the end of the concert where we see no less than six people being carted out of the arena. Overall I felt the balance between stage and audience shots was pretty good.  If this is the only full live concert filmed and likely to be released on DVD of this talented man, then buy it, enjoy it, don't look for faults in it and appreciate the guy at his best !   Hopefully we will see a DVD of his rehearsals for the 2009 tour with over 100 hours being taped - who knows.  Michael Jackson, you will be sorely missed !

B000W796OM|4.0|In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), Chris Columbus made room for Alfonso Cuaron as the new director for the third installment in the series. Cuaron's changes brought the series in a new direction, yes, but created a few problems, too.     First off, all the familiar faces in terms of characters are there, with a few new ones. The biggest change in terms of casting is the new Dumbledore. After Richard Harris' unfortunate death soon after the release of [[ASIN:B000W746GK Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Widescreen Edition)]], Michael Gambon was chosen as the next actor to play Dumbledore. The problem with Gambon's performance is the lack of warmth and caring nature of Harris' (especially because the character is portrayed as a kind old man in most of Rowling's books).     Some things about Cuaron's direction that I did like were the increased amount of humor, but not at the expense of accuracy to the book. I also got a chuckle out of the use of the Whomping Willow to represent the changing seasons.     The film is darker than the previous films and feels like it's target audience was teenagers and adults. The gloomier atmosphere, especially the creepy Dementors, made me think that this movie's rating was only borderline PG.     One other flaw I think the film had was having Harry, Ron, and Hermione wear street clothes. I thought that having them display the styles of 2004 would date the film in years to come.     Overall, the film is worthwhile entertainment. Not quite as amazing as its predecessors, but its good qualities outweigh the bad ones. 4 stars.
031606792X|4.0|Sure, I like the Twilight Saga as much as anyone did. I started reading Twilight and soon enough I was in a frenzy where all I'd do was sit and read and obsess over the story. I loved the world Stephenie created, and I still do, but it got to the point where I was angry with some of Stephenie's decisions...    Twilight- I fell in love with Edward, as other thousands did. I didn't find any part of the story a bore. I really hate fantasy, so I found the interesting twist of mythology and a real life read satisfying. Totally adored it, 5 gold stars.    New Moon- Bllllleeeeecccccchhhhhh!I just about felt like hitting my head against the wall. I was (and am) still on Team Edward, knowing he was only trying to do the right thing, but Bella is an insane sissy. I mourned for her too when Edward left(as almost everybody did) but I expected her to go and hunt down the Cullens or maybe thre would be a cunning twist in the plot but no, there is Acobjay Lackbay (Jacob Black). Sure, it's a good thing that he helps her become strong again, yep, he's a decent guy but I wish he would just stop there! There's this whole mushy-gushy friendship between them! At that point I'm thinking WHERE THE HELL IS EDWARD? And then there is like a hundred pages of her contimplating if she should try to let Jacob become a bigger part of her life. Also, it's kind of boring how Bella goes on and on worrying about Jacob and all the Quilette legend stuff. The  only good part is when Edward comes back at the end. 2 stars to New Moon.    Eclipse- I liked it enough. I loved that Edward was a lage portion of the story but Bella again has to be so melodramatic. She needs everything to be perfect for her and she needs everyone to like her. She totally freaks out if Jacob is depressed and so on and so on... Can't she just try to live a normal life sometime. Can't she resist the temptation to have two boyfriends? I though Stephenie had good, detailed writing but she should have let Bella have a little more pride. I loved the most romantic side between Edward and whiny Bella but it kind o sucks it up when your horny Werewolf best friend tags along. I also enjoyed seeing the vempirey side of the Cullens. I give it 4 stars.     Finally, the book I originally started to review. Breaking Dawn- I love how Bella had her perfect wedding and her pefect honeymoon. I think she should've been able to make a clearer decision between Edward and Jacob though. (I was especially peeved when he showed up at the wedding). I thought that the wedding sounded dream-like and the honeymoon very Bella-ish  so I was quite pleased with it. Then Bella gets pregnant, because her life is sssssooooooo perfect. I liked the way that Stephenie showed Jacob's side of the story, but I was pissed that she planted him write in the middle of the situation again. Can't he just get out of her life? If it wasn't for him Sam's pack wouldn't go after the Cullens at all. Then she has the baby, Jacob imprints on her, she becomes a vampire and the supposed battle is nothing. I liked the happy part of the story, how she has Renesmee and her beloved husband, but shouldn't there be a sadder twist in the story? Shouldn't Jacob start a new life? Shouldn't we learn more about the Cullens? I nstead of learning a bout Bella's family we get a sneak peek inside the werewolf pack, not that I minded but... you know. In conclusion I truly loved Breaking Dawn and the series for that matter, but I wish that Srephenie would have though some of the concepts through more.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|If you are looking for something light.  Don't buy it.  If you are looking for something that is rust-proof and requiring no blade maintenance, don't buy it.  If you are looking for the sturdiest, most durable blade in a survival/camping knife, get this one.  You can chop a 4\\" birch to the ground with this knife.  Yet, you can get the thing as sharp as you want.  It has no peer when it comes to the amount of abuse it can take.  It is well worth the money.  Get yourself one.
B000VWE5OY|2.0|Well, I was originally drawn in to this world by Dr.Who series 1. It was well-played and put together nicely... just the right amount of \\"cheesiness\\" and humor. Good. I liked it. Series 2 of Dr.Who with the cast changes was not as good in my opinion, but whatever.. My point is.. when Captain Jack's character came along, it was a nice addition. I liked the story arc he was part of. Well done, fun, all that. So I was excited for Torchwood and finally downloaded the season (1)  the other day.<br /><br />I gotta say.. everyone does a great job with the acting, aside from Captain Jack. (John Barrowman) He just seems to be WAY over-doing every line and action. It really makes it a task to watch, becuase his cast-mates are doing a fine job. I guess I just expected more. There are undertones of bi-sexuality and homosexuality throughout various episodes. I have no problem with it, but they often seem out of place. It takes away from the story when it is unnecessarily forced into a scene.<br /><br />I dunno.. I can't see myself even finishing the series after just watching 3 episodes. I hope you like t more than I did.
0061537969|5.0|At first you think it's going to be a strange book, it's written from the viewpoint of a dog afterall.  But once you read it, you realize why so many people are reading it.  A lot of us will read many books in our lifetime, but we can count about ten that really inspire us and that we will remember the rest of our lives.  This is one of them.
B000SFD21Q|5.0|This book reinforced what I have found to be true in my own life! Each AND every physician should, without a doubt, recommend rigorous exercise of some type for their patients. Not only does routine rigorous exercise help you THINK better, it helps you feel better about yourself, be more positive, less depressed, leaner and just sharper over all.  People ignore exercise because it requires work. It requires effort. Most people would rather eat poorly and remain lazy, it's human nature. This book provides clear, scientific PROOF of what I really knew.  I have recommended it to friends and relatives.  Exercise simply helps us live longer, have fewer physical and mental problems, and give us an overall brighter attitude.  I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone and everyone.
0385341008|5.0|I was at the Bible study group I attend, the day of our leader's birthday and the hostess had invited other people in the mobile home park to stop by for cake and ice cream.  I recognized one of them from a writing class we both attended and we sat together and I learned all about The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society and as she talked to me, I said \\"It sounds something like 84 Charing Cross Road which I read about 20 years ago.\\" It really sounded like something I would enjoy reading.<br /><br />When I left the study and was walking to my car, Agnes came over and handed me the book as a loan. I loved it. What an inspiration to us all the guts and courage of all those members of the society through the War. I was a small child in North West London during the War so I really empathised with the book. I know it is described as fictional but I believe there was a lot of truth.<br /><br />I also like the format of writing letters and when Agnes mentioned that to me, that was what made me think of 84 Charing Cross Road. Before I even returned the book, I had got on to Amazon and ordered both books. I still have to reread 84 Charing Cross Road which was also made into a wonderful film starring Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.<br /><br />Margaret Garrett Irwin
0446402397|4.0|This is the sort of book which can be seen in at least two ways.  First, it's an excellent example of thriller fiction: well-written, pacey, addictive and full of interesting characters, including an appealing hero.  It's drawback is that it's formulaic and, despite what some of the other reviewers here have written, predictable.  The major plot twist wasn't suprising enough.  Also, the (fairly) happy ending clashed with the backdrop of the injustices and terror of that time and age.     Second, this book is an essay about the grimness of life in Stalinist and post-Stalinist Russia.  And for that, it's excellent.  It really takes you there.  And far better to convey this sort of information through the eyes of the characters in this book than through a stiff work of factual history.    All in all, four out of five.
0307460444|3.0|The book has plenty of cake recipes and frosting recipes.  I just have not had time to make any of them yet.  Good ideas for themes.
B00136NWNW|5.0|This was recommended to me by a fellow Pink Floyd fan who stated that it was Waters at his finest.  In perfect honesty I agree. This sound is more of a \\"Roger Waters\\" sound than a \\"Pink Floyd\\" sound.  It provides the listener a great scope of Waters as a solo artist than as an ex-Pink Floyd member.  The \\"Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\\" is more of a Pink Floyd sounding album, owing to the fact that it was written at the same time as \\"The Wall\\", and almost was a Pink Floyd album.  This is not a concept album in the sense that it tells a story but it does have a theme.    The music on this album is fantastic and Waters is at his creative best, although it may not be a good idea to play this around young children.  The singing isn't award-winning, but the rest of the album makes up for that.  Each song is well crafted and put in the proper place.  Not to mention that he also has (and makes good use of) the guitar skills of Jeff Beck on certain songs.  If you just want to start out by downloading one song, try \\"What God Wants Pt. 1.\\"  HOWEVER, if you buy the whole album (the CD booklet lists the musicians on each song and gives you the lyrics), in order to really get into it, you have to be willing to put the time into listening!

1416550542|3.0|First of all, I've never read any books by this author before.  I am very much enjoying the book and am almost through with it.  However, I just came to a huge flaw in the story.  If a very young girl has an overdose of x-rays to her ovaries, and they do not function at all, she would not have periods.  It would be like doing a total hysterectomy on a child.  She probably wouldn't even have gone through puberty.  Kate Morton might want to pick up a copy of \\"Our Body, Ourselves.\\"  I'm just dumbfounded that a woman would not know that.
B0028KF4ME|4.0|I liked the first two seasons better, because it was more interesting to me to watch the character Dexter struggle with dissembling humanity and learning how to connect with others.  Now, in the third season, he's dealing with being a husband, father and friend, and the show has less tension the more human he becomes.<br /><br />Each episode is still of the highest quality, regardless, but I didn't have the \\"holy crap I can't stop watching\\" drive that I did with the second season.  Jimmy Smits is wonderful to watch as Miguel Prado, but I never felt the same danger that I did with Jaime Murray/Lila Tournay.<br /><br />The show looks amazing in HD, because the cinematography is so good.

B0015DWJX2|3.0|I read this book for a bookclub, and I was disappointed. The title sounded so intriguing. While the letter-writing format was unconventional and interesting, I was left wanting more substance. The characters seemed stiff and unreal. However, I did learn about the Channel Islands (between England and France). If you want to learn a bit of history or background for travel in the area, this book offers a good, yet simplistic narrative.<br /><br />Cherie Renfrow-Starry<br />Private Practice Therapist/Counselor

0143034901|5.0|In J. M. Coetzee's Disgrace, the main character says that poetry either speaks to you right away, or doesn't speak to you at all. Shadow of the Wind spoke to me right away. As we enter the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and discover the rare book called Shadow of the Wind, written by an obscure author named Julian Carax, not only the protagonist gets swept up in Carax's life. Past and present begin to intrude on one another, and the lives of all the characters become entwined.<br /><br />There is a quote on the back of the book that says that even the subplots have subplots. This couldn't be more true, but what it fails to add is that even the subplot's subplots are not merely diversions but integral to the overall story: what happened to Julian Carax, and why is someone trying to destroy every copy of every book he ever published?<br /><br />I can't speak for the original, as I can't read Spanish, but this translation is gorgeously rendered: highly lyrical. It's a beautiful book simply to read, let alone for the story, which on its own I found entrancing. I simply could not put this book down. And the more I read, the deeper I got involved in the character's lives, the more I felt compelled to read. I can't remember ever reading a book of this length so quickly. And many of the images from the book have stayed with me since I read it, such as the man with his eyelids and lips burned off approaching our young narrator on a dark, quiet street.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've immediately fallen in love with a book as I have with this one. I look forward very much to the follow-up Angel's Game.

0688101364|4.0|There are enough detailed reviews on this book for anyone wanting more information.<br />  Like Beranbaum's other books, the recipes are meticulously written, contain beautiful pictures and descriptions and a little \\"bio\\" on each cookie in the book.  The recipes are also her typical \\"untypical\\" recipes and aren't the quick and easy types most people have time to make.  These are special cookies you'll be proud to share.  These are cookies to savor making with your family and friends.<br />  There are very few recipes in this book that I actually use (lemon bars are my favorite from the book), but I refuse to part with it because of the awesome information she gives on ingredients, tips for better cookie making, storage, etc.<br />  I also love that she includes the weight of the ingredients as that is my preferred way to measure.<br />  I wouldn't pay $20+ for it, but I would absolutely by it for under $10 used!
0446402397|4.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend because we are both Martin Cruise Smith fans, and this book seems similar, but it takes place in Stalinist times. I lived in Russia for a few years, so that makes me particularly interested.    I haven't read it yet -- I'm just responding to Amazon's request that I review it. My friend says it looks good and that the author appears to be a real person, and not just a pseudonym for Martin Cruise Smith, though the name is somewhat similar.    The shipping was perfect, and fast.

B001ASIRZG|2.0|I got this on the premise that it was region 0 and would therefore play in a normal US DVD player and could replace my region 2 copy. This is not, in fact, the case. The DVD cover makes it very clear that it is for regions 2,3,4,5 & 6. So putting that aside, I thought the CD might be okay - I know it's a great show. The CD is absolutely terrible - I haven't managed to get through the whole thing because the tracks I did try to listen to - \\"Hunting High and Low\\" and \\"You'll Never Get Over Me\\" both faded out halfway through the song. For example, \\"You'll Never...\\" cut out the whole part of the song where Anneli sings the countermelody - \\"I will get over you\\", so that's pretty much at least 2/3rds of the song.     I cannot believe that this was approved for release. It is atrocious. Do not waste your money.     The only reason it gets 2 stars is because despite all it's flaws, it is still a-ha, and i could never give them just one star.
0307269981|5.0|**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />The Girl Who Played With Fire is an excellent sequel to the deservedly acclaimed The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  It is the second in what will be a three part trilogy following the life of the Lisbeth Salander, an abused genius with what her friend, journalist Mikael Blomkivst, believes is Asperser's Syndrome.<br /><br />In the previous novel Salander, who has a photographic memory, helps Blomkvist solve a mystery and in the meantime dealt with her own personal travails.<br /><br />Here Millennium Magazine, part owned by Blomkvist, is going to publish an edition exposing the key players in the sex trade in Sweden.  During the course of the early part of the book a double murder takes place and Salander is the prime suspect.  Recall that she has plenty of reason to really hate sexual abuse of women, having been abused herself.  The police are looking all over for Salander who goes into hiding, while Blomkvist himself is trying to solve the murders and exonerate Salander, who he believes is innocent.<br /><br />This novel is equally as good as the last, meaning it is excellent.  It has several threads as the murders and the impending article on the sex trade and Salander's past start to merge together.  We learn a great deal of Salander's past and childhood that greatly explains her behaviors.<br /><br />The novel is somewhat long, but it an engrossing and enjoyable read.<br />Unfortunately the author died suddenly of a heart attack after writing the first three books.  I can't wait for the next installment, and will be sad that this series will end prematurely.
031606792X|2.0|I have to admit that I became a Twilight fan late in the game. My friend had just picked up \\"Breaking Dawn\\" and raved so much about the first three books that I felt I should read them. \\"Twilight\\" was good escapist literature. Through Bella's eyes I was able to remember my first attempts at love and my own awkward high school moments. The principal characters were even introduced and developed much better than I would have expected for a book with the target audience of teenage girls. I also applauded Meyer for taking her own spin on classic vampire lore; the addition of the Quilleute shapeshifters was especially interesting to me.   Amidst all of this, I began to notice a disturbing trend in the books; Meyer began to create incredible tension only to relieve it with deus-ex-machina mechanics. This became painfully obvious at the end of the third book. The entire book paves the way for a huge battle between vampire factions; the battle lasts all of a chapter and none of the principal characters are killed. These mechanics only get worse in \\"Breaking Dawn.\\"   The following is a list of these conflicts and the deus-ex-machina mechanics used to resolve them:   -First, one of the sacrifices Bella thought she had to make in marrying Edward was their inability to have children together. However, through some strange biological explanation, Bella is in fact able to have Edward's baby.   -This in turn creates another conflict. How on earth will Bella survive the birth? Well, she doesn't in the literal sense of the word and becomes a vampire like she's always wanted.   -Now, another conflict that Meyer has prepared her readers for over and over is that Bella should become hard to control, impulsive, and too strong for her own good. Does that happen? No, because of Bella's power, she is immune to most of these effects.   -Also, Bella is supposed to have to sacrifice her relationship with her father once she becomes a vampire. This is \\"resolved\\" as Charlie decides he just \\"doesn't want to know any details.\\"   -In addition, Renesmee's growth worries the newly married couple and parents. Will it stop in time? Will she be immortal? Long story short: yes and yes.   -Then comes the worst let down of the books. The anticipated Volturi showdown, foreshadowed even in \\"New Moon,\\" takes place in the very end of the book. In fact, there are pages upon pages of lead-up to the fight that explain vampires joining forces with the Cullens against the powerful family. However, Bella's power is able to shield the Cullens and their allies against the Volturi mind attacks. The Volturi then basically give up and go home, leaving Bella and Co. to live happily ever after. Therefore, Bella and the entire Cullen family emerge from the series virtually unscathed.   The problem with this type of writing is that character development precipitates from conflict. The characters in the novels remain relatively stagnant because they are never asked to sacrifice anything. The back stories of the different members of the Cullen family help explain some aspects of their characters but this doesn't help the reader understand their connection with Bella any better. For example, I couldn't help but feel that I was being told that Bella and Alice were best friends by Meyer more than they actually acted like best friends. And while I don't ever like for characters to die just for the sake of it, it seems unrealistic that none of the members of the Cullen family died or experienced any type of grave injury while protecting Bella throughout the series. This shows that Meyer may in fact like her characters too much to let them go and ruin the fairytale ending of \\"Breaking Dawn.\\"   Due to this lack of realistic conflict resolution, while Stephanie Meyer is a promising new writer to the genre, her writing style has a lot of growing up to do.

0525421033|4.0|Forman has crafted a sweetly poignant story out of such sorrow by weaving the emotional web of Mia's heartbreaking journey as she travels through her past towards a decision as to whether she'll have a future.<br /><br />Expertly written the author tells the story of not only Mia but everyone who surrounds her all from the singular viewpoint of a girl teetering between life and death. It is in this seamless movement between past and present then the ultimate focus on the promise of a future that we connect best with Mia. Further, by using love (familial, friendly and romantic) as a common thread Mia navigates its many forms so that it reverberates through each aspect of the story until she has to stop and think of what could be lost if she let everything go.<br /><br />By showcasing the lives of Mia's family and friends through the use of flashbacks the reader bonds with each and is shown how their presence in Mia's life makes the weight of her looming decision all that heavier. In seeing their interactions we feel how much she has to live for yet understand how she could see equal value in letting go. These strong characterizations allow readers to have a stake in Mia's life right along with her friends and family. Readers are given the ability to feel the compassion and empathy for her in the moments she spends watching on as visitors vigil beside her seemingly lifeless body. We find ourselves rooting for her to make the best possible choice - some hoping she chooses to live while others understanding why she wouldn't.<br /><br />Taking this emotional ride with Mia is not light or fluffy. While there are happier moments, in flashback, there are an equal number of instances where the reader's heart will break. In the end, that is the exact reason I encourage all to pick up a copy.

Damn The Torpedoes saw them reach huge commercial and critical success, and their follow-up album established them as legends.  Tom Petty has always looked out for his fans and in 1981, he threatened to withhold and rename (to \\"The $8.98 Album\\") Hard Promises if MCA didn't back down on their proposed price hike to $9.98.  The fact is, Hard Promises is essential listening - regardless of the price.  Classics like \\"Woman In Love\\", \\"Nightwatchman\\", and \\"Letting You Go\\" showcase Petty's diverse writing skills.  Petty wrote his duet \\"Insider\\" for Stevie Nicks to include on her first solo album, but ended up loving it so much that he wouldn't let her have it.  Once you hear this beautiful duet, you will understand why.  \\"The Waiting\\" is quite possibly Petty's best song and is deservedly Hard Promises' crown.  The Heartbreakers have an extensive catalog of 5 star albums - many themselves worthy of top 10 lists, and Hard Promises is the best of them all.  Thank you Mr. Petty and the Heartbreakers for being the cornerstone of American Rock and for giving us Hard Promises at any price.
B00008WT5E|5.0|I am blown away by just how great AC/DC was in the mid to late seventies prior to Highway to Hell and Back in Black. The remastered sound quality is out of this world good and Bon Scott and the guys never sounded better. I recently bought the entire collection of AC/DC US studio releases and the 1978 release titled Powerage is one of the greatest forgotten albums in the history of Rock and Roll. From Gimme A Bullet to Riff Raff to Sin City everything rocks big time. I highly recommend you give it a listen. I find it incredible that it was not a bigger commercial success. I've been blasting a lot of AC/DC in my car lately driving quite speedily and I've loved every minute of it. I've never understood truly why a guy like Bon Scott is so missed by fans but you get it when you hear more than just Highway to Hell like I had up until now. Prior to his death the band was a cerebral hard rocking blues band and after his death they took a turn away from their bluesy heavy roots and got lost for quite some time in a sexually charge scream fest. I do love much of the Brian Johnson era even enjoying Sink the Pink from 1985s Fly on the Wall immensely but after 1981s For Those About To Rock they got lost in an endless cycle of songs that literally obsessed with women and sex and the lyrics stopped being as artistic and became downright silly. 1990s The Razor's Edge reaffirmed Brian Johnson's worth and AC/DCs ability to revive itself from near dead with the hits Thunderstuck and Moneytalks. Powerage is AC/DC at its best at a time when it was the songs and nothing else that mattered most to a band finding its way to the top. Indeed it was a long way but they did it the right way whether or not the buying public in 1978 understood that.

1400034779|4.0|This is the first book of the widely acclaimed series featuring Botswana's Precious Ramotswe and her tiny detective service. Although it is not technically an historical mystery, to us it seems timeless and has value in its presentation of a slow paced, dignified side of African life that is often overlooked. Precious' rare combination of refinement and ingenuity more than once helps her solve problems both big and small. Her understanding of certain situations as a female of a certain age holds her in good stead as well.

0307454541|4.0|When I first began reading this book I almost decided to stop.  It was very involved in the business world which went over my head. Soon there after the characters began to develope and more importantly the main plot, and then I was hooked.  I had no idea what was going to happen and found myself eager for the next chance to read.  I highly reccomend this book and would give a B+.  It would have been an A but some of the business stuff I found was quite boring.  But read on and you will not be disappointed.
1433502410|5.0|After receiving Christ as my personal Lord and Savior I began to read the Bible. I tried to avoid study bibles or other commentaries. I wanted to know what the Bible said and what I thought of it. I did so and was immensely impressed. That was 35 years ago and it just keeps getting better.<br /><br />But at some point I decided I did want to know what others thought and that I could learn from them too. One of my first purchases outside of something like an annotated Zondervan was the Archeological Study Bible, which I love.<br /><br />After digesting most of that I purchased the ESV Study Bible and while I find some of the notes a bit too \\"doctrinally correct\\" it is nonetheless and outstanding study guide. I highly recommend it to any serious Christian who is ready to hear what others have to say about the Word of God.

B0000CDJPQ|4.0|I used this to connect my fw400 monitor cable to my fw800 only new mac.  It works fine for my old (no desire to replace) fw400 compact flash card reader, which I now just plug into the monitor's fw400 link.      But I also tried it out as an option to use to connect my fw400 canon scanner to the computer, and it did not work with this or with the fw400 to fw800 cable I also tried out.  Ended up using the scanner's USB 2.0(?) link instead.  So, basically ymmv on how useful this is.      (And it's several bucks cheaper as I type, less than a month later.  Amazon can be so annoying sometimes.)
1588167461|5.0|There are some books on how to dress well -- books like Russell Smith's [[ASIN:0312361653 Men's Style: The Thinking Man's Guide to Dress]] -- that are heavy on theory, you might say: not only how to observe the principles of timeless style, but why those principles are correct in the first place. I tend to enjoy reading those kinds of books, and was a little disappointed at first to see that this book from Esquire did not really spend a lot of time in explanations and philosophical discussion. But the more I read, the more it became clear that the man who is really interested in learning these things can pick up a lot from \\"The Handbook of Style.\\" Esquire has packed a lot into this small-ish book, and most of it is quite good.<br /><br />It is, as I say, a small book, and it is quite densely packed. I probably would have preferred a larger format, which would have in turn allowed for larger type, larger illustrations with clearer detail, more white space, and a layout generally more friendly to aging male eyes. But then, maybe this is intended primarily for younger men -- an audience I certainly encourage to study this book closely. The authors embrace the classic and traditional in men's style, navigating by the light from, among others, the holy trinity of Astaire, Grant, and Windsor. (Jay-Z and Andr&eacute; 3000 are cited as modern exemplars, and while I don't follow their careers well enough to know, I'll take Esquire's word for it.)<br /><br />For men in, or just out of, college or otherwise looking to define their own style -- a time when guides like this were pretty influential on me -- they or their loved ones could do much worse than to track down a copy of this book and begin studying it. There's a lot older men can take away from this too. I admit I was a little skeptical to begin with, but now I'm convinced this is one of the better utilitarian guides to come along in many years. It certainly deserves a place on many men's shelves.
0312370849|2.0|Great upside potential was present in this story of little known French holocaust atrocities, however, having \\"a classic weeping heroine with a gorgeous, albeit thoughtless husband\\" uncover the tale behind the hidden closet was insulting.  Chucking in a neurotic female in the present-day side of the tale was idiotic.  Skip it - dead preschooler in the closet does NOT make this anything like Elie Wiesel or anybody else's work. Bleh.

0066620996|5.0|After reading this book, I now view leadership in a different way. Collins distinguishes good leaders from great leaders and what is the difference between the two. Great leaders look at themselves to find fault and are introspective, instead of attributing failures to outside forces. Great leaders pick the right people for the right positions and do not compromise. Great leaders are quiet and humble, while good leaders toot their horns and are flamboyant. Most of the \\"great leaders\\" attributed a lot of their success to leaders before them who had paved the effective road before them.  After reading this book, all I attempt to do is create systems and mechanisms that are designed to set up those who follow me to be successful. A must read.
B000001DYD|3.0|A recording whose reputation begs influence and historical significance (and not without a handful of flat-out brilliant songs), but a release which nonetheless comes across too ragged and underdeveloped to warrant the kind of perfect reviews \\"important\\" records get. Harvey works the bare-bones, Albini-helmed attacks well, but would vastly mature as a songwriter throughout her career.
B001CUXZT0|4.0|When I had first purchased this album in 1977, at age 19, I thought to myself, well Cooper has said in many, many interviews that he was motivated by hot sweaty greed. So here Alice tried to compete with who was big at the time, as I can best remember that would be Barry Manilow. My first impression was that this album does indeed suck but I was 19 then and into \\"Killer\\", \\"Schools Out\\" \\"LITD\\" and even the more psycho 1st 2 albums on the Strait label. Today I'm 51 and I still love the original bands hard stuff, but with age I can now sit down and appreciate \\"Lace, and Whiskey\\" for it's own merits, just as I have a new appreciation for all of Coopers 80's stuff, and it is not that bad. Different textures, and not as monolithic as the early hard stuff, and more extensive orchestration. A note here, the LP witch I purchased on E-Bay as part of a collection seems to have been more carefully mastered than the CD which seemed to be another just get it done and get it out there production.
B000002MU3|5.0|I understand completely why so many REM fans don't like this album.  The lyrics are vaguer, more suggestive than meaningful.  The instrumentation, while still very lush, is more abrasive than those coming up through Murmur would be used to.  But there's still austere beauty here, in the droning of \\"I Don't Sleep, I Dream\\" and the hypnotic \\"Bang & Blame.\\"      I will admit there are a few misses.  \\"King of Comedy,\\" while entertaining, is overly simplistic and hampered by the extremely low, filtered vocal.  \\"I Took Your Name\\" is a bit too fuzzed out, and not as charming as either \\"Circus Envy\\" or \\"Crush with Eyeliner,\\" the later of which it strongly resembles.  Even \\"Let Me In,\\" though a great song, could've benefited from a stronger, clearer recording.    Yet I enjoy the challenge of the lyrics.  They're difficult to hear at times (this IS Michael Stipe, after all!), but they mean different things to me each time I hear them.  I always enjoy albums like that, where no one meaning dominates.  Some might think that directionless, a point I understand, but I think it more a case of having limitless direction.      Plus, I love the fuzzy guitars.

0439023483|5.0|What a spectacular read.  To the critics who claim it is a rip-off of Battle Royale:  perhaps.  But great novelists often write about a previously written theme.  This book brought back memories of \\"The Lottery: by Shirley Jackson, \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" by Richard Conner, and The Giver by Lois Lowry.  If I was still a teacher, I would have a field day with this book!<br /><br />When reading a book that regurgitates a previously told story, you look to see how the author puts her own unique spin on it. Collins tell the story in a new and vivid way.  The characters are compelling and believable. Her prose is accurate, horrifying, but not over the top.  The greatest aspect of this novel, I thought, was the way the Collin makes a fantastic critique about modern-day reality t.v. shows: about how brutal they are, how inhumane, and how they blur the line between reality and perceived reality.<br /><br />This is the first of what I'm sure is going to be a fantastic, riveting trilogy.  If you want to get your teenager reading, hand him or her THIS BOOK!

B0026J8LHM|2.0|Let me preface this by saying Dream Theater is my favorite band. I have all the albums and have seen every tour since Awake.  However...  Black Clouds & Silver Linings is a disappointment. There is nothing new here. DT have managed to produce something I never thought they would: a formulaic, relatively boring record. Granted, there are extremely high expectations for every new Dream Theater release, but for good reason. The boys are capable of so much more than this album.  Just take a brief glance at the liner notes and you'll see lyrics devoid of anything but the most basic structure. That's not to say James LaBrie can't sing; he's just not given any material to work with. The reliance on tired themes from cheesy 80's rock really hurts the songs too.  Petrucci, Rudess, Portnoy and Myung still have incredible skills and show them off whenever possible, but it's hard to get excited about even the most impressive pieces when the album as a whole is so stale.   Some people may appreciate the compilation of some older tracks in \\"The Shattered Fortress\\" but not me; the track comes across as an unoriginal rehash of older material and a cop-out. At least drummer Mike Portnoy is finally putting the \\"AA\\" theme to rest with this one (we hope).  In summary, if you're a big Dream Theater fan you'll buy this album anyway. But if you're on the fence about the album then your money is better spent elsewhere.  I pre-ordered this one to have it on day 1 but I won't be doing that with the next release. Maybe they've jumped the shark, maybe they just need a vacation. Whatever it is, they'll need to win me back with the next one.

0790737345|4.0|We have looked for a copy of this movie in retail stores and even preowned copies at video rental establishments.  We have found it twice paired with Michael on the same dvd.  We own a copy of Michael, so we did not want to pay extra money for the two.  We were happy to see there were a couple copies available on Amazon at a reasonable price.  It was not much of a gamble for us because we have seen the movie.  We were however concerned for the condition of the movie.  The case was a little damaged inside and out when we received it, but the disc was in good condition.  We enjoyed the movie again and have added it to our collection.  Overall, this was a good buying experience from Amazon.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show has some of the most intelligent writing and best acting of any sitcom in years.  It really does rank right up there with the classics.  I've been recording and SAVING every episode from the second season on my DVR and replaying them over and over.  The Sheldon character is one of the best I've ever seen on TV.  He will have a following for years to come.  The first episode of season 2 is FANTASTIC.   Buy season 1 AND season 2 they are worth every \\"Penny\\".

B002BIULQ2|5.0|I'm 55 years old with a 6 year old. She was so excited to see this movie in the theater. We picked up a friend of hers to go with us and as I drove us all to the movie I was looking forward to a nice nap in a nice dark theater as the girls watched the movie. I have to say this is the kind of entertainment that should be made more often. I watched the entire movie and loved it. It was warm and the messages for kids were fabulous... especially that you can get too big for your britches. Since there is a good chance that my kid falls at least in the top 10 of spoiled kids in America... this is the kind of entertainment I want her to watch. Trust me all you Daddy's this is a good movie for you and your girls. I have a whole new respect for Miley Cyrus... She is quite a talent and her song \\"The Climb\\" was spectacular. A good message for all kids. See this movie... you'll be glad you did!!
B000AMJC2K|4.0|I originally purchased this arm hoping to use it with my new Dell 2408 24\\" monitor. While the 24\\" monitor is technically under the weight limit of the Neo-Flex LCD Arm, even with all the adjustments tightened it felt very flimsy and wobbly once I installed it. I ended up ordering the [[ASIN:B0009XVGMO Ergotron LX Desk Mount Arm - mounting kit (45-179-194)]] to hold my 24\\" monitor, and moved the Neo-Flex arm over for use with my Dell 22\\" monitor.<br /><br />What a difference! With the smaller monitor installed, this arm moves smoothly from side to side, and the height adjustment is much easier as well. Even with the added weight of a monitor-attached speaker bar, the Neo-flex feels very solid and not flimsy at all.<br /><br />I'm using the Neo-flex attached to one of the cable-management grommets in my [[ASIN:B001AXP0MO Legar&eacute; 60\\" x 47\\" Corner Desk]] and it fits perfectly, installation was very simple, and the installation instructions were very detailed.

B002436WJE|3.0|I have to say all in all I was disappointed by Taken.  First of all, I think the best thing in it is the acting of Liam Neeson.  He is completely believable as the retired CIA assassin who goes to great lengths to return his kidnapped daughter.  Now granted that suspension of belief is key to any movie but Taken really tests this. For one thing, no one but Neeson's character seems to be able to shot straight and he is mysteriously impervious to bullets.     Also, he can overcome any security system and much like the Rambo movies, if there is a place guarded by 100 armed men, he can take it single handily. The other characters are superfluous and the other friend who goes to Paris with Maggie Grace might as well have one of the old Star Trek red shirts because we know she's going to be sacrificed to show how bad these dudes are.     All in all a movie that well good enough, could have been so much better with some thought put into the script.
0312330871|5.0|Agatha Christie's classic novel, And then there were none had me up late, reading in bed.  I developed the habit as a young girl to always keep a book by my bedside.  I got grounded a couple of times for reading past my bedtime but it was always worth it.  Christie's novel was well worth the late night hours, early mornings and even the tension right before I drifted off to sleep.  For those who don't know the premise of this classic, 10 strangers are invited to Indian Island, made famous by previous owners and constant rumors.  Once there, the guests become aware of the horrifying fact that they will never get off the island again - one among them is killing them off, one at a time.  Once the ball gets rolling the book doesn't slow down and in brief lulls of action the tension is tight with anticipation.  Readers who haven't read Christie will be awe-struck at the brilliant way she pulls off the murder mystery.  The murder mystery was published in 1939 and authors today are still attempting to master the art as well as Christie did.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm a physical therapist, so I know how to work out, but I use home fitness DVDs a few times a week because sometimes I need motivation from someone else.  I'm very critical of these workouts though; there are only a handful of instructors who I think teach with good form and cueing.  This was my first Jillian Michaels DVD and she is absolutely on that short list - great instructor!    THE INSTRUCTION:  Jillian and her two friends all have excellent form on every single exercise.  I appreciate this because the girl who shows the modified moves (Anita) is very fit and does the moves perfectly - this is important for a beginner to watch!  (I hate when the most unfit person on the DVD shows the modifications - that does the true beginner no favors.)  I enjoy Jillian's no-nonsense style of motivation - she gives it to you straight (\\"You don't get abs like this for free\\", \\"You can't rest during a 20 minute workout and expect results\\", etc) but she's not scream-y or drill instructor-y.  She explains her 3-2-1 philosophy clearly (more on that in a bit) and she's absolutely right that combining strength with cardio is the most efficient way to work out.  She's also right that you can't take a break in such a short workout, but don't take that tooooo literally.... I do take 5 second breaks between circuits to sip water.  All in all she is tough, but she knows what she's talking about.    THE FORMAT:  There are 3 self-contained 20-minute workouts.  Each one follows this format: 1 minute of warm up, three different 6-minute 3-2-1 circuits, 1 minute of cool down.  The 3-2-1 circuits are: 3 minutes of strength using hand weights(30 seconds of a 'serious' exercise + 60 seconds of a compound - legs and arms - exercise, twice through) + 2 minutes of cardio (30 seconds of cardio + 30 seconds of another cardio, twice through) + 1 minute of abs on the floor.  The 3 20-minute workouts are designed to progress you through different levels of fitness: start with level one for a few weeks, then level 2, then level 3.  In my opinion, this is a well-designed and and very time-efficient way to workout, and it moves along at a nice pace that doesn't get boring.      Two things I love about the self-contained workouts (as opposed to mix-and-match style): 1- You don't have to choose between toning and cardio, one workout has both, and 2- Once you are bored with Level One, you don't just keep doing it with add-ons to do Level Two... you have a whole new workout to do.    THE EXERCISES:  The strength moves are basic and effective.  I like that they are separate from the cardio moves (you put your weights down for cardio and abs - except in one circuit of level 3) because that's safer for your joints.  They include exercises like (a variety of)push-ups, rows, bicep curls, flys, chest presses, etc, and the 'compound' moves combine upper body exercises (like the bicep curls)  with squats and lunges to keep bigger muscle groups working and fat burning. If you're strong, you could use some heavier dumbbells here because the instruction is excellent and the moves are controlled and safe. The cardio starts out as moderate impact - jumping jacks, butt kicks and the like.  Jillian does not show low impact modifications here because she wants people to push themselves.  I agree, to a point.  But people with bad knees or backs, in my opinion, should stick with low impact versions of these moves.  (If this is the case for you, I would caution you not to do this DVD if you have never exercised before.  Take some classes or do some DVDs that do show low impact modifications - then you can modify Jillian's moves yourself.)  In levels 2 and 3 Jillian makes the cardio more intense - including plyometrics (jumping) like squat thrusts and 'mountain climbers'.  For these more advanced moves, she does have Anita show modifications.  The abs workouts are nothing new (crunches, reverse curls, leg lifts, bicycles, etc) but are all effective and well-demonstrated.    WHO CAN DO THIS DVD:  Level 1 is actually what I would consider an Intermediate level workout.  Beginners can do it as long as they use no or light weights to start, and as long as anyone with bad knees or backs modifies the cardio to be low impact.  Level 2 is solidly Intermediate - a tough, intense workout that is not for beginners.  Level 3 is Advanced, though an intermediate level exerciser could do it if they follow Anita's modifications.  A very advanced exerciser may want to do level 2 and level 3 back to back.  As far as coordination levels, all the moves are basic and well-explained.... nothing fancy here and anyone should be able to follow this.  If you're looking for something dancy - look elsewhere.    BOTTOM LINE:  Three well-put together and intense workouts, very well instructed and demonstrated.  Something for almost anyone - unless you are brand new to exercising.

But this is by no means a one-man act....the whole main cast is absolutely funny and you are always amused, entertained, and intrigued by the silly and yet-so-new-york-like-life. And viewers always come back for more, not just for the humor and the story line but after all, don't we all want to know how Ted Mosby met the mother of his children? If you liked FRIENDs and SEINFELD, then you are going to absolutely LOVE this show!!!

B001PPLIEG|1.0|After Casino Royale I was really upbeat about the franchise going with Dan Craig. He still does a great job (along with Judy Dench) but the writing has become a complete flop. Violence and sex in a Bond film, or any other film for that matter, should be treated like salt in a recipe. If you use half a teaspoon or so the film comes out great. If you pour in a cup then you will gag on the results.       This film made me gag. No effort was made towards character developement or plot. Mathis, who was a great character in Ian Fleming's books was killed off. Felix Leiter is developing into something quite different than Fleming had written. Fleming's Bond series was good because Fleming was a good writer. The current generation of writers has done nothing more than borrowed the names from Ian's books and written them into trashy plots - if you can call them plots.        While Indiana Jones was successful with non stop action, I don't think the Bond series will be successful with non stop violence. Peopel get desensitized and in the end, bored.
0810993139|5.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid was the book that got me hooked onto reading more often. Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a about Gregg Heffley's 7th grade life, and what situations he has to overcome. Jeff Kinney,the author and illustrator of this book,has put Gregg in a world of bullies,jocks,nerds,etc. to support the realaistic feeling that any teenaged-kid would get when he/she reads this book. Gregg also has 2 annoying parents and brothers that don't understand what Gregg's situation in life is. Gregg Heffley's story has got me hooked onto reading because personally I think that his story is the most realistic life story I've ever read, which compares to what could actually happen in a middle school. It also gets me laughing out loud every time I read it. This diary in cartoons,or journal as Gregg refers it to as, has inspired me to make up my own story character's life. So in conlcusion, the Wimpy Kid series has been the most interesting experience for me. I can't wait to read book 4,which is coming soon.
B0026J8LHM|3.0|Don't let some positive reviews sway you here. This is NOT DT in top form. Not musically, not lyrically. Of course the music will always be great, but the songwriting is questionable. Worst DT lyrics yet. Also MP needs to stop \\"singing.\\"    Quick track breakdown: ANTR- By far my favorite. It's up there with Glass Prison.   AROP- Decent track, not particularly engaging, but enjoyable.   Wither- Completely forgettable.  TSF- I like it, heavy and very pleasing to listen to.  TBOT- Beautiful intro, sadly turns into a Rush knockoff.   TCOT- Bad lyrics, cool guitar, but I don't enjoy the chorus.   Overall, I have to disagree with positive reviews, this is weaker than Systematic.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Oh yes, Orson Welles, achieved something extraordinary with Citizen Kane, I don't want to give details about the how he do that. What I can say, is that a film consists of many aspects from the story, the screenplay, the actors/actresses, visual, art, ...etc. Orson Welles, had simply push the boundaries of many if not all of these aspects, either from an artistic or/ innovative point of view. Simply buy the film and watch it how many times you want and then you will realize that you have something special in your hand. This is my review after I watched the film 2 times only, I'm looking forward to watch it again and again, because there is so much to watch.

0321525655|3.0|I like the design principles and process tools that are provided in Presentation Zen: those are definitely usable and useful, and if I were rating on the book only on the learnings I came away with, I'd give it higher marks.     But I felt I really had to dock marks because of my experience with the book: I found it quite ironic that, for me, the book really failed in the very goals the author says we should have for our presentations: content that is engaging and is clear.     I was quite surprised to find this book non-engaging: for me, it has been a slog to work through. Typically I can read only part of a chapter before I wanted to put it down. I don't normally read like that, and I can usually get through a book like this within a few days, but it has taken me weeks to endure just the first half!    At first, that left me puzzled: The book has visual appeal; the chapters aren't overly long and there are only ten of them; why can't just get through them? The probable reason came to me in reading the chapter \\"Simplicity: Why it matters\\": the author really fails at his own ideals of simplicity. Not in the visual design; the visual design of the book is good in this respect. Rather, he fails to keep the written content simple. That very chapter on simplicity made this apparent to me. Let me explain.     He starts with two pages introducing the topic: simplicity really means clarity: getting the essense of the message and presenting that in a way that's clear for the intended audience -- and a key to that is eliminating the non-essential (simplicity). So far, so good.     Then he spends two pages using a comparison of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates as illustration. Now, I'm not convinced that the stereotypes of these two are fully valid, and maybe that was a factor, but overall these two pages really added nothing to my understanding of the author's message. In other words, for me that was two pages of non-essential content that only distracted and detracted from the author's message.     The next sub-section is six pages long. The last page is well done and simply has a quotation that is relevant to the author's message: \\"By stripping an image to essential meaning, the artist can amplify that meaning...\\" (Scott McCloud). But that was preceded by five redundant and somewhat-tedious pages:     The sub-section starts with a discussion of three Japanese concepts: kanso (simplicity), shizen (naturalness) and shibumi (elegance). But the discussion of shizen really just re-iterates the need for simplicity: the recurring theme in that portion is restraint; naturalness is never mentioned after the opening sentence. (Along the way, he introduces another Japanese term \\"miegakure\\" without explaining it -- more distracting content that added nothing meaningful for me.) After that is a full-page discussion of elegance, and that was just more elaboration on simplicity (good taste can be attained in restraint). Then there are two more pages (\\"Wabi-Sabi Simplicity\\") in which the author further reiterates the less-is-more idea.     That's followed by a page with a side-bar anecdote that I found pretty silly: it leads to a nonsensical conclusion that a fish shop doesn't need any sign to advertise and identify itself. (More useful would have been a discussion of pros and cons for different signs.)     So, six pages on \\"kanso\\", \\"shizen\\" and \\"shibumi\\" that I found highly redundant with many paragraphs of text that added nothing new to the message. I think that has been typical of my experience in the book so far, and the reason I've found it a slog: there's been a lot of content that adds nothing to the message.     Like the bullets of text on slides that the author wants to steer us away from.     How ironic!     In part, I think the author's obvious interest in Zen and in Japanese culture may be contributing to this problem in the book. He wants to include elements of Zen and Japanese throughout the book because they interest his and because they relate to _his_ understanding of simplicity, clarity and elegance. But it seems to me that he failed to apply his own recommendations of going through a process to understand the audience and to tailor the presentation in a way that will get across his core message to them -- including elminating non-essentials. His core message is not about Zen or about Japanese culture (and if those are topics you want to read about, you can find much better books than this). His core message is about something else, and excessive incorporation of these other themes is, at least for me, a distraction.     In summary, then, I found the book to have some really useful ideas on creating presentations, but that they are presented in a way that really misses the mark in the very goals it strives for. I can readily imagine that Reynolds does live presentations on the same topic that are excellent and highly effective, but for me this written presentation is neither of those things. I'd give a buy rating for the usefulness of the ideas but with this strong caveat for the written presentation. (It's the first book on the topic I've read, so I don't have better alternate suggestions.)

B0000AUHPB|5.0|Don't bother with the recent glitzy remake.  The classic 1969 version starring Caine and Noel Coward as well as a bunch of other great actors in cameos is way, way better. Actually, the stars of the 1969 film are three Mini Cooper autos which the gang use to carry away the loot and out maneuver (NOT outrun) the cops. The remake is all special effects and edginess.  The Caine film is all live action, full of suspense and hugely funny.  Coward as the English mob boss is iconic. And it ends ambiguously!  What recent film about a bank robbery would dare to let you imagine what happens after the film ends? There would be a shoot out and someone would win.  This is so much better. You'll spend an hour arguing about it. Get this for your collection before it is no longer available.

B0028K31CE|5.0|Maxwell has done it again. He mentioned in his video that this album is the 1st outta 3. Blacksummersnight. Black is the 1st CD that is kinda dark and about the past. The Summer CD is about his present vibe, kinda uplifting and in the moment. Night, well thats the kinda baby making/love making music Maxwell is famous for-<br /><br />Cold-is just pure genius at its best. He explains how he was riding in a taxi cab and heard the sound of the windshield wipers and decided to make a song out of the beat of wind shield wipers rubbing against the car window. The thought is this is pure genius and proves how there is music and beauty in everything.<br /><br />Help Somebody is 1 of my favorites, the horns, piano, and drums are outta control. Its one of those songs were you cant help but bop your head to. I can say the same about Bad Habits with is 1 of my favorites also.<br /><br />To you Maxwell-from the bottom of my heart and soul-THANK YOU for sharing your soul with us, we missed you!<br /><br />Darlene
B000SFJWLU|5.0|The music of Five Finger Death Punch is exactly that, like a hard punch to the face, it is brutal and honest, but also they have a great feel for melody as well.  This is truly one of the best metal debuts that I have heard in a long time.  Singer Ivan Moody, as others have stated, truly has limitless range, he growls and screams as good as anybody, but he also has a great singing voice with a flair for melody!  The lyrics are straightforward and easily decipherable, but the strong point of the lyrics is the honesty and the way they are universally relatable in most of the songs!    The album starts off with Ashes, in which the intro to the song is Ivan screaming like a madman, you know you are in for a brutal album right away.  Ashes is a very heavy song with autobiographical lyrics by Moody and is about people accepting him as he is or they can fu** off, and the song has very melodic chorus with great vocals!  The Way of the Fist is a brutally heavy song with really great drumming and awesome heavy riffing throughout, the pre-choruses are probably the best part to the song because the beat is just cool as hell.  The Way of the Fist track sounds something similar to Slipknot around the Iowa era.  Salvation is one of the more powerful tracks on the album and is a song about finding personal salvation without having faith in god, basically athiest's peace, and is a really great song, definitely one of the best on the album!  Ivan is basically sticking a middle finger out at people who would look down on him because he doesn't believe in religion, he doesn't need them.  The song is also a perfect combination of very brutal verses and a really great hook, and again a very melodic chorus.  The Bleeding is the big single off of the album, and is the most diverse song on the album.  It is still heavy, but is also easily the most melodic song on the album, and is about a meaningful romantic relationship gone bad, and trying to deal with it.  It is clearly a song that anybody who is been through a horrible break-up will relate to, and it has the most melodic verses on the album by far.  A Place to Die simply has just amazing guitar work by lead guitarist Zoltan Bathory, he plays some amazing solo's on this track, as well as throughout the whole album.  The song is again easily decipherable and is about searching for your place in the world and it being a very difficult adventure.  The Devil's Own is an intensely personal song by Moody about his relationship with his father, it takes on a similar format to the song as many of the songs with very heavy verses and again a very beautifully sung chorus by Moody, and this is definitely one of the most powerful songs on here.  Lyrics like \\"It's because of you I'm broken, it's because of you I'm dead inside, it's because of you I'm godforsaken\\" paint a strong and sincere picture!  This is easily one of the best tracks on the album.      White Knuckles is just a bada$$ track, which starts off with Moody simply saying, \\"Fu** it all!!!\\"  The song seems to be about basically being discontent with the world and how people are.  It probably features one of the best and most hardcore breakdowns with Moody screaming, \\"I'm taking back control.....WITH MY KNUCKLES!  Another great song.  Can't Heal You is the heaviest song on the album along with Meet the Monster and is about not being able to help a person dealing with an addiction because they do not want help basically!  Death Before Dishonor is another song that is somewhat similar to something that Slipknot may have done in the Iowa era, and is a great song about trying to live life to the fullest and ignoring people that get in your way, has a great solo to begin the album and that explodes into a full throttle assault by the whole band, has an incredible heavy main riff and then again a great chorus.  Meet the Monster is one of the two heaviest songs on the album, it simply owns.  The intro to the song is one of the heaviest I have ever heard!  This song is just brutal and heavy from start to finish, it is one of the less melodic songs on the album, but is all the better for it!  A perfect album closer, in my opinion.  The Bonus songs that you get if you by the special version are actually a lot different that the original 10 tracks, they are not as heavy and are more radio friendly.  Never Enough is a very radio friendly song with mostly sung vocals and a pretty generic chorus, good for people who like more mainstream stuff, but fans of the heavier stuff may not like this one.  The song does get a lot better towards the end.  Stranger Than Fiction is along the lines of Never Enough, in that it is not as heavy as the first 10 tracks, and features a great vocal intro by Moody followed by a very cool breakdown.  It is a good song, but more radio friendly like Never Enough.  The Bleeding (Acoustic) if you like acoustic stuff is very good and I really think it was a nice addition, you get to really see Moody's vocal chops again.    Overall, this is a first-class debut by these guys and I would recommend this to anybody who loves heavy music, metal, thrash, and also to fans of Slipknot as they and FFDP have a somewhat similar style!  Pick this up, you won't be disappointed!
1416562605|3.0|I liked the book, but found it too unreal. So I would say it's a good fiction piece. The letter format is too unreal, along with many details happening with this guy including his character is unreal. Transformation from a devotee to a killer is really drastic, and then he did not get caught? no one from Dhanbad ever came to Bangalore? The type of family he worked for, in reality they will not only kill his family but hunt him down like a dog and sniff him out from any where ..after the murder the book raps up too fast. ....but overall first half is enjoyable<br /><br />The main character is very self centered, but shrewd, although quite controversial ( If he really had killer instinct (littrelly) that should show in other actions; Another incidence when he saves the life of his nephew, and knowingly let's his whole family die ?? ; he gives money to the family of the kid who dies from his employed driver, but on the other hand is ready to kill his nephew if he revolts? again very unreal).<br /><br />Book is a good bollywood Movie matrerial (Like Slumdog...) , and I can picture some actors in Bollywood who can perfectly play this role e.g. K K Menon for the main role :) ...
B0026NWBY2|5.0|While \\"Let It Roll,\\" is not a true best of/greatest hit or a complete career-spanning collection---there are too many songs missing for either of those---what it is is a GREAT selection of songs that serve to remind us of just what a great artist George Harrison was.  This selection (decided on by George's wife, Olivia) flows beautifully...let it roll...and all the songs fit very niceley together.  I love that it is a \\"complete album\\" in that the songs are not in chronological order.  One just goes with the next and on and on for a great listening experience.  George Harrison was, in my opinion, the most inventive, melodic guitarist ever.  Period.  This collection amply demonstrates that and highlights his song-writing ability as well, just in case people had forgotten about what he did in his life and the music he created.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|I would have to say that the series is a great one to have for the collection and it even has some bonus material that only comes with this, unless you can shop around for the bonus disc by itself.  I've read many other reviews saying that they wished that they bought the original individual seasons since the trays/dvd cases they were in are more sturdy and the price for those series has become competitive with this collection.  The only problem is the original individual seasons dotn have the bonus disc which is great to have to see the impact of Star Trek and other interviews.    In truth, I bought this collection for the bonus disc as I saw that the bonus disc itself on ebay was going for a higher price than what I believed it was worth ($20-$50 for a bonus disc?!)    My 2 complaints are the fragile cases for the dvds and the not so easy access to each case.  The cases are pretty fragile and the best way to work around that is to shop around for new cases and keep your collection out of these cases.    If you were to keep the dvds in their original dvd cases, be aware that you have to always remove the upper plastic case that goes over the entire collection (which can be a little tricky to put back on) and then remove the dvd case for the dvd you want to watch and then play (its just one extra step but it can be a little difficult and doesnt make the dvds easy to access.    Still a great series with a bonus disc but this would have been rated a whole lot better by others if the design and quality of the case was stronger and easier to access.  Maybe they may release the series in blue ray (but expect that to cost quite a bit more)    My suggestion is that if you really want the bonus disc and want stronger quality cases is to buy the individual seasons and then shop for the bonus disc, but realize the bonus disc is charged by others to be more than its worth as it only comes from this collection. I bought this series and just bought some stronger sturdier cases that held multiple discs.  I keep the original cases they came with simply as a place in my dvd collection.    Good luck with your decision and enjoy!
0375842209|4.0|A different type of story about a young girl alone at the begining of WW2 in Germany. How she survives and what life was like during that time. The author has done a good job in describing the characters in the book. Anyone who lived through this historic period probably knows about the war and the battles but little about how people survived on the home fronts. The book held my interest but I am not sure I liked how the book ended.

0316017922|1.0|Disorganized book with no structure. Questionable definition of success (money + fame). The way I understand the book's main idea is that if you are raised by the tribe of apes in Africa, you might as well become Tarzan, but never someone like Bill Gates. And Bill Gates is extremely lucky that he has not been born in Africa and raised by the tribe of apes. Something like that. Well. It's a bit of a stretch to think that. I do accept the idea that luck and your cultural background matter, but I believe that hard work, persistence, determination, proactiveness and passion matter much more. Way much more.
B001U0HBQ0|1.0|For a character study to be successful, one needs to LIKE the characters. Not possible here. Benjamin is cold, unfeeling, and abandons his wife when she needs him most. Benjamin practically never speaks during the entire movie and is void of any emotion throughout. And the wife...a loose, amoral person who sleeps with anyone and is always gloomy and depressed. All in all, this movie is simply an exercise in special effects and make-up, period. For anything else, Benjamin Button SUCKS.  Steer clear of this turkey.
0767802470|4.0|I played this movie when my mother came visit me last month. Near the end of the movie, when the captain screamed \\"schneller!\\" on the conning tower, I turned to asked her: why haven't they dived? She answered without taking her eyes off the screen: they need to get away fast... My point is: Das Boot is not a \\"guy flick.\\" It definitely requires patience on the viewers part in order to sink in the atmosphere. Unlike more recent films, it does not reach out to grab your attention.    I regard Das Boot as a remake of Moby Dick with a WWII setting. There is Captain Ahab - always tempting fate and pushing the limits. He obviously suffered from hubrism. His character bordered obsessiveness, but he was noble and likable at the same time. There is Ishmael - a by-standing narrator who lived to tell. His greenness and outsider role served well to place the audience's perspective among the crew: why else would the boatswain need to recount daily nautical routines? There is the merry crew of the Pequod - raucous and vulgar but professional and trustful of their good captain. There is, finally, Moby Dick, always elusive but always there, always threatening, and ready to take charge of life when you least expected it. I especially enjoys how the captain repeatedly challenged fate, and how every time his hubrism was punished even more severely. (\\"Come on, is that the best you could do?\\" was followed by more bouts of depth charges) These did not prevent him from gleefully celebrating after he narrowly cheated death near the end of the movie. (Not yet, comrade! Not yet!) If Fate-Hubris was indeed what the movie was trying to convey, the movie's ending is justified. Otherwise, as my wife pointed out, the ending is artificial and unwarranted. I also wanted to point out that this is what plagues all German movies about WWII: they have to be gloomy, they have to be negative about the war, a nihilistic ending is mandatory. Can you image how Europeans will boo at it if it ended with a Spielbergian non-philosophy?    As it is with all good movies, Das Boot is suffocated by fan excesses. If you don't enjoy this movie, you must be retarded. If you do not think that only the lengthiest version deserves existence, you are weaksauce. If you do not fast and abstain from women and alcohol for 3 days before watching, you are a heathen. If you do not think that graininess add to the authenticity of this movie, you are an idiot. If you do not think that Das Boot is the greatest movie ever made, you... The \\"uncut\\" version wasn't the original dead sea scroll. Das Boot was first released as a 150 minute movie. Four years after release, the leftover footage was scrap together to make a TV series, obviously to squeeze more $$ out of high market demand. Then comes the director's cut. I used to own the well-cut VHS version and didn't think it distracted the enjoyment of this movie. Now I own the director's cut, the superbit director's cut (for the DTS audio alone, video has same problem), and have just ordered the \\"uncut\\" version. Why? Because I like this movie so much. But it isn't The-Greatest-Movie-Ever-Made-Period.    I wish the DVD gives you the choice of playing the theatrical version only. Three and a half hour is simply too long if I had to introduce it to my friends, and not all of them are so crazy about movies like this. I doubt if a blu-ray version for this movie will ever be made. The original footage is too poorly preserved to warrant one. A worthy blu-ray release requires the movie to be massively remastered and restored. The current market for this movie probably doesn't warrant such expense. But then, I will be very delighted to be wrong.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|Yes, it is a band that has been around for a long time. But, the lyrics on this are pretty good and, I would say it does a wonderful job in the Details. Those notes and instruments that get inserted between two passages of harmony. Very original and forget comparison with decades past. It actually is a wonderful albun to listen to when you are driving through the desert or at night time. It's like a trip on its own. Try comparing it with a lot of the stuff being put on the market, this is very much above it.    I recommend tracks 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8. I know I mentioned 7, but these were my favorites.
B0013FSXT6|2.0|Please note this review is not about the movie itself, but rather the picture quality of the Blu-Ray version.<br /><br />I am a big fan of this movie and some of the wonderful qualities of the film are the use of color and the set up of many of the wonderful shots.  Unfortunately, the Blu-Ray does not upgrade/enhance the picture quality significantly over the DVD version.  Using a Panasonic Blu-Ray player with a 50-inch Panasonic plasma screen TV, the quality of the picture was mediocre if not poor.  There was visible pixelation and the colors did not 'pop'.  This stands in contrast with the other Blu-Ray movies I have purchased and my OTA HD TV signal.  Overall, disappointed.
1932100660|5.0|The title is somewhat misleading, as the book is about much more than the actual China Study, which makes up only one of five parts in the book.  This book gives solid evidence to the many benefits of a plant based diet.  I have lost over 30 lbs. since going on this type of diet and gone from a 40\\" waist to 36\\".  The book also tells how we Americans have been brainwashed by the meat and dairy industries, with the help of our own government!  The author should do a sequel with more details on their findings in the study.
0312383436|4.0|With secrets and unexpected plot twists galore, the Wedding Girl is an entertaining read you won't want to put down. The main character, Milly makes some questionable decisions when confronted with a secret from her past that may prevent her from marrying the man she loves. As the stress from Milly's past grows, it creates problems that seep into the lives of her loved ones and friends. The author, Madeline Wickham, does a great job of bringing each character and their anguish vividly to life on each page. I highly recommend this book.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|While most reviews here were written well before the pop masters death, I'm giving this a new look in the aftermath of his passing, especially since many people just want to renew themselves with his music in their grief and remembrance. When this came out, it was a very good compilation album. It's still a good one now. Not only does it include pretty much every song he had that topped the charts, it even includes some Jackson Five goodies and hard to find--maybe forgotten-- gems like \\"Blame it on the Boogie\\" and \\"Rock your Body Down to the Ground\\"  My friends always tell me I can always find that one song that's not on someones greatest hits, and for me, this one is missing another hidden \\"Thriller\\" soft, sexy and soulful goldie \\"The Lady in my Life\\".      Despite that omission I can appreciate this for giving you all of his great songs, many, of his great songs in one place, where you can use this CD to create your own play list and import them onto your computer. 1 star reviewers are griping about \\"another\\" greatest hits album, or remarking on MJ personally (losers) but with the days of ipods replacing turntables, we can't exactly take our \\"Thriller\\" \\"Bad\\" and \\"Off the Wall\\" albums with us when we go out. Now, if you want to still rock to \\"Billie Jean\\" or \\"Another Part of Me\\" you either buy it on itunes, buy a converter to copy your records to CD or get a greatest hits album, which is always cheaper and more convenient.     I still don't think there is any one extremely golden and perfect compilation disc out there with MJ's music, as I have mentioned \\"The Lady in my Life\\" was something I noticed, I'm sure someone else has a favorite song that's not on here too. But this is still the most complete and the best I have seen to date, and is really worth picking up, especially if you don't have a Jackson Five greatest hits (which I also own). I know we don't want to re-buy music, but if you really love those songs from the 80's and (days of tapes) 90's you sometimeshave too.     I think an Essential Michael Jackson on DVD with videos would make a great companion. I have yet to find that out there, especially one that respectfully and sensibly has all of his videos in long form. [[ASIN:1573300403 Michael Jackson - History on Film, Vol. 2]] (and volume 1) is probably your best one stop shop. Jackson made the videos, I want to appreciate them. I don't want an edited form of \\"Smooth Criminal\\" or \\"Thriller\\" and I'm sure he'd want us to appreciate them too. I shouldn't have to feel like I'm chasing John Dillinger just to find the long version of \\"Bad\\".    Overall, an excellent group of songs, and the price is not outrageous. I get nostalgic every now and then and dust off my record player to listen to \\"P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing), but now I can listen to it on the train, while taking a walk, or even lying in bed. Awesome.
B000E6EHGI|4.0|perhaps best studio album...along with Shakedown, American Beauty and some say Anthem...maybe Workingmans comes close.  Actually Touch of Grey is their truly best studio but that is a different era.
0810970686|5.0|My 10 year old daughter reads this series every night. I always ask her \\"Don't you ever get tired of reading the same books over and over again?!\\", but she always says no. I didn't understand her until I read the books. They were great! I totally recommend this series and I believe that if you're looking for something to make you explode with laughter, this is the book for you!
B00005JO5L|3.0|I liked the suspense but I'm not sure of the ending.  Left too many questions. I was surprised with the graffic nature for a  80's movie.

B0002KQNJU|4.0|I.<br />Some note how the movie was meant to be a parody on vampire movies (more specifically the Hammer Horror series). If it is, it possesses too high of a quality to be a simple parody. Even though the movie tries its hand at slapstick, it's not what lingers. What stays in mind is the acting, the scenery, the direction and the atmosphere. Neither funny nor scary, the movie is an even mix of haunting ambients and warm settings. The overall mood is strikingly good, the camera work is stunning and just the feeling of watching something old gives you pleasure. Polanski is a mastermind, obviously, and he uses all the advantages of his time to push boundaries and manages to impress with work that's powerful all the way through. Everything from lightening to music is masterfully executed. The movie takes some time to take off, but when it finally does, you don't mind spending as much time as you did watching it.<br /><br />II.<br />The acting makes for a very convincing movie. Polanski is great as a mousy apprentice in love with a maiden played by the especially enthralling Sharon Tate, who looks good in bath, as we've witnessed in the film, twice. Ferdy Mayne, with his piercing German accent, does a good job playing Count von Krolock. The characters are very dissimilar to each other: Tate is graceful, playful and sexy, Polanski is frightened and quiet, MacGowran is brave, cooky and determined, Quarrier is unpleasantly spooky and Mayne makes his presence felt in every scene, which is always welcome for the main villain.<br /><br />III.<br />The movie manages to thrill, mesmerize, stun, daunt and please, making it a magical experience for the viewer. The only problem is that an average viewer wants a genre classification that will, I suppose, set the right mood and awake the right emotions. Considering how average viewers go, this should be a disappointing piece of work. The trick is to forget about what it's supposed to be -- as well as what you want it to be -- and enjoy it for what it is.<br /><br />Maybe there's a harpsichord loving person inside of you who will get enchanted by snowy landscapes, rich sets and playful dialogue, as well as a sense of quirkiness that bubbles around the surface. The movie may surprise you, if you give it a proper chance. One thing is certain: it won't leave you indifferent.be there's a harpsichord loving person inside of you who will get enchanted by snowy landscapes, rich sets and playful dialogue, as well as a sense of quirkiness that bubbles around the surface.

6305718954|5.0|Well done movie.  Obviously one that the Catholic church would not approve of.  High quality acting, suspenseful, well-done but not overly done special effects.
B000683VI4|1.0|After so much hype and all of the special DVD releases, I have been wanting to watch this movie for a long, long time.   But to say that I was bitterly bored and disappointed once I finally managed to see it, would be a massive understatement.    This movie was boring, predictable and long and at the end of it, all I could think about was that I had wasted $8 of my hard earned money on this rubbish, but more importantly, those were 2 hours that I'll never ever get back again.    I was looking for a little bit of entertainment on a quiet Winter's Sunday,  I wasn't looking for a sleeping aid.   Though if you are having trouble getting a good nights sleep, then this movie may solve all of your problems.    There are a lot of bad movies out there, but I think I hate this one just a little bit more than any other.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The Dualshock 3 is an excellent replacement/additional controller for the included (on older models) PS3's SIXAXIS controller.  And the rumble feature makes PS2 games feel more like they did on the old system, but doesn't add significant weight.  I'm still a big fan of Sony controllers and have no regrets that I didn't have to try another brand.  The battery charge seems to last just as long as on my old controller, et cetera; no surprises with this unit -- it's solid.
B0015DWJX2|3.0|After seeing all the rave reviews I looked forward to  The Guernsey....  Unfortunately I was very disappointed and couldn't wait to finish the book.  The prose is exceptional, but as for plot line, it went no where.  It was a unique style - at least to me - to tell a story solely thru letters, but a bit unbelievable solely thru letters, but a bit unbelievable.  Some of the exchanges sounded more like email, an many would in reality been done by phone, a technology which was admittedly viable on Guernsey.  As for telling a love story, save me from any such relationship.  Which is no terrrible surprise after reading Olive Kitteridge, but at least Olive was much more engaging.

0553582461|5.0|Robin Hobb has created two characters that will put their roots down in your heart: Fitz and the Fool.  I read this series directly after finishing the Farseer trilogy (skipped the Liveship Traders).  Hobb's strength is her characters and their relationships.  Even for folks that are not big fans of the fantasy genre, the Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies are highly recommended.
B001EN71CW|5.0|The original was good but the improved visual details and sound quality with the blue ray make this a worth while purchase even if you own a standard dvd version of the show.

B001UREJWM|3.0|Being a Sabbath fan since I was 13 years old (meaning for 38 years) I have to say that while it's good to have a new album this one did not satisfy as much as I thought it would.  Don't get me wrong because it does have a number of very good songs on it but overall it could have been much better.  Many of the songs are way too slow, almost ballad-like, and I think the writing was very repetitive because I still have difficulty distinguishing between several of them.    While it's not the greatest I'll take it because it is still from the masters.  Thanks Tony, Geeze, Vinnie and Ronnie.

B001AEF6BI|4.0|Dress changes, music changes, but the struggle of teens to find a place in the world continues.<br />The Janitor in this movie has more wisdom than the vice principle?<br />The kids don't get worse, the teachers get older and less adapted to the future that is happening around them?<br />Here the pairing off of the males and females is kind of strange:<br />the popular girl with the Jock to start that changes to the<br />jock and Kook and the princess and the criminal.<br />My old criticism of the movie is that they left the Brain as solo.<br />I enjoyed this movie which may actually become a classic as it holds up 20 years later.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I am not a fan of modern television. Most shows cater to the lowest common denominator or have storylines that go no where. This is the opposite!<br /><br />The show centers around an ad man, Don Draper, who struggles with his past and is actually a coward. He cheats and lies on his wife, rejects his own brother...yet you pull for him. The show also follows Don's new secretary, Peggy, who has an affair with an account exec, Pete. Pete is absolutely a rotten man who plays the perfect anti-Don.<br /><br />The show is visually stunning and has that modern 60's feel which gives you the impression of Leave It To Beaver but the dialogue is anything but. One wonders how men got away with what they said/did but the women were just as bad. You will feel bonds with the characters and you will care about their fates. That's great television in my book!

B000000ITD|4.0|An old favorite recording from the `60s featuring music by Antonio Carlos Jobim, Getz/Gilberto was given the full-blown GAIN System treatment by MFSL. The result is a sonic and musical feast for the ears, but a feast of subtleties, little inflections of rhythm from the drums, quiet chords on piano and guitar, the gently probing saxophone of Stan Getz weaving in and out of the melodies, and the quiet, intriguing voices of Mr. and Mrs. Gilberto. There may be a whole generation of audiophiles who never heard this the first time around: thanks to MFSL, they can now join in the fun of hearing master musicians work together in an intimate yet international musical setting.
B00186K7EE|5.0|I've rated this VIDEO a FIVE but NOT who is gouging the people of the US for this DVD.<br /><br />This is one of the BEST videos I've ever owned since 1989 - came out in 1988. It is a treasure to have in our family. One of my favs is \\"Speed Demon\\" partly because the animator, Will Vinton also from Oregon has images of Downtown Portland, Oregon in it and the song is so awesome as are all of the songs and videos on MoonWalker.<br /><br />I just checked over on Sony's Michael Jackson Web site to see if this was available on DVD as I only have it on VHS and found it out of stock. However after reading the comments I was shocked to find that THEY too were selling it for $200.00! So I took the advice from one of the posts and headed on over to Amazon.co.uk and bought TWO LEGIT DVD's of this fantastic video for under $24.00 total (includes shipping to US) from Amazon EU S.a.r.L. selling for £4.98 each. I don't care that it is in PAL format since my DVD players play Region 1 & 2. The prices this is going for NOW in the US is criminal!<br /><br />Screw Sony and all those trying to cash in on Michael's tragic death!<br /><br />RIP Michael! You will forever be THE KING OF POP!
B0000047EC|4.0|Bassist Charlie Haden and guitarist Pat Metheny have played on many recordings that have found a home in my collection over the years, sometimes as leaders, sometimes as sidemen, sometimes together, sometimes separately, but this is the first CD to feature just the two of them in a duet setting. Both these musicians are from Missouri, and both love to tell stories through their music--thus the title of this CD. This is largely an acoustic album, just the two of them picking in the studio, with just a light touch of electronic shading from time to time overdubbed by Metheny. Musically, this is a CD that is soft and tender; sonically, it is clean and powerful, and it is going to give some systems fits. Special notice should be given to the packaging of this CD, which is both functional and beautiful.
B001IAOEXU|3.0|For me these triggers are so/so. I am no Andre the Giant but I'm a big guy with big hands. The problem that this creates for me is the accidental button press.     With my hands in a 'relaxed yet ready to fire state\\" my trigger finger ends up pressing ever so slightly on the button and causing various effects. If it's a driving game then I'm holding down the break, if it's a shooter then I'm accidentally firing and letting my enemy know where I am.    Though I'm not a big fan of this item I suggest you give them a try. They are rock solid and for most can make the controller more comfortable and usable.
B0019OP0GU|2.0|The story opens in London in the 1930s, as an eccentric explorer (Richard Griffiths) returns from his adventures with three orphaned baby girls to be raised by his niece (Emilia Fox), while he goes off on another long trip.  As the girls become teenagers, they enroll in a theatrical school hoping to earn enough money to support themselves:  Posy wants to be a ballerina and Pauline (Emma Watson) wants to be an actress, but Petrova just wants to fly airplanes.<br /><br />Adapted from a well-loved children's book, this made for BBC film suffers from a script full of holes and poor direction.  We meet a houseful of characters but don't get to know any of them well.  Their dialogue is lifeless and lacking in real emotion; except for the wonderful Ms Fox,  they merely take turns dully reciting their lines and each scene falls flat.<br /><br />Emma Watson ([[ASIN:B000W7F5SS Harry Potter]]) looks nervous and awkward  and her character, like the others, is superficial.  She's supposed to be a great actress, but this isn't shown; Posy is supposed to be a gifted  dancer, but again, we just have to take their word for it.  Pauline, the aviator, is ignored altogether.  Recommended only for those who enjoyed the novel.

B000Y7U98C|4.0|Science vs Movie; Folks, Please, it's a movie. Where the science strays from \\"reality\\" is neccessary for cinematic purposes. That's good. It's not a documentary. The combination of great cast, Danny Boyle and excellant behind the scenes work make for a visually stunning, thought provoking spiritual journey even for scientists, like me. I'm not sure that a scientist can criticize this film from a scientific perspective. We are far from understanding the science neccessary to approach the theme of this film. However, as a film, it's another excellant piece of work by Danny Boyle et al. Enjoy the wonder!
1559409002|5.0|This is one of the best horror classics ever.  It is a cult film that was never really popular in its time, but has recently resurfaced.  It is well worth getting.  There is no blood and gore, no sex, no bad language, just atmosphere and suspense.  A young church organist is in an auto accident and nearly drowns.  Shortly after that she accepts a position in another church. On the way to her new job she passes an old abandoned circus, which she feels strangely drawn to.  She is also followed by a creepy man who seems to be tied to the circus.  The music in the film is mostly ethreal organ music which helps create the film's tense, other-world atmosphere.  My favorite scene is the one in which she is driving and spies the circus building in the distance.  The car radio is stuck playing the strange organ music whilethe sun is settingg, and she nearly hits the creepy man.  The atmosphere was surreal and the movie maintains this feeling throughout.<br /><br />The main character is also pursued by one of the most obnoxious suitors in movie history.  She accepts his company only because she is afraid of being alone as many strange things continue happen to her, including further sightings of the creepy man, a fugue like state and nightmares.  While this may sound a little contrived by todays standards, remember this movie was one of the first and it manages to be convincing even today.  The end of the movie was predictable only because it has been done so many times since--but once again this was one of the first.<br /><br />Hats off to those who made this wonderful film available again.  I truly enjoyed it.
B000MKXEME|4.0|Re-Animator is one of the most gruesome horror movies of the 1980's.  Based on a short story by H.P. Lovecraft, Re-Animator contains all of the essential attributes of a great horror movie.  Zombies, severed heads, science experiments, and excessive gore make this an over the top movie; one that went far beyond anything created before it.
B0028K3192|4.0|It's about time! WTF? 2009 has been a sad year for new music. Maxwell stays true to his style as when he last had a product out. The horns and organ riffs throughtout many of the tracks really give his weak and whispery  voice a much supportive  boost. Dang near a decade has passed since his last output. WTF? Dude must has been holding out for more Sony moolah as he revamped his contract. Rumor has it, this long delayed CD has been in the can since 2006! Sony is giving him a push with a deluxe CD/DVD and vinyl release. Four stars is what I give this one. A four star CD in a 1 star music year. Calling D'Angelo!

B0024F08RO|3.0|Okay, this review has some *spoilers* in it.  You've been warned.    Oh, Prison Break, season four.  What happened to you?    I'll be honest.  Season four of Prison Break was excellent...until about halfway through.  The first half of the season was on par with seasons one and two (let's just pretend season three never happened, okay?  We'll all be happier for it).  The writing was tense, economical, and interesting.  The acting was quite good.  The plot was, surprisingly, attention-grabbing.  Everything was firing on all cylinders.      If the show would have just wrapped itself up around episodes twelve to fourteen, it all would have been a terrific ending to a fairly decent series.      However, it just went on...and on...and on, and it just became more ridiculous and insulting with every episode.  By the time the show shifted location to Miami everything had gone to hell.  Sure, Prison Break has always acquired a certain amount of suspension of disbelief, BUT...oh, hey, Michael and Linc's mother isn't dead and, hey, not only is she not dead, she's a completely one-note, evil villain pulling all the strings...and, oh sure, why not, Michael and Lincoln aren't really even brothers.  Introducing plot elements like these needs WORK to have them overcome their obvious soap-opera-ish roots, but the work and thought just aren't placed into them.  So, Mike and Linc's mom is alive.  What are the repurcussions of this?  None, really, she's just instantly another villain.  No subtleties are explored, nothing new about the characters is learned, it's just a cheap gimmick.  So, Lincoln was adopted and he and Michael aren't true brothers...what does introducing this idea accomplish?  That would be nothing.  The story isn't changed.  The relationship between the two characters isn't changed.  It, too, is just a cheap gimmick.    And the re-introduction of long-gone characters?  C-Note?  KELLERMAN?  Jesus.  They added absolutely nothing.      However, I must say that throughoutthe entirety of the season (both good and bad) two absolute stand-outs are William Fichtner and Sarah Wayne Callies.  Fichtner's Mahone never once ceases to be an absolutely interesting and, more importantly, believable character.  Fichtner is one actor that truly has the goods.  As for Callies' Tancredi...well, she undergoes quite the makeover to strong-willed, capable woman in season four and the transtition really suits her.  Sarah Tancredi really comes into her own this season and Callies pulls off the evolution of the woman very well.    If you start watching this season, just turn it off around episode fourteen and write your own ending in your head.  Your opinion of the show will be better for it.
0312330537|5.0|This is my new favorite book. The story grabs you from the beginning and seems to have a little something for everyone. I think this book will be a classic for years to come. Just don't start it unless you have a few day to do nothing else but read - it is that kind of book.
B000AOEMXM|4.0|The trials and travails of the inaugural Enterprise, pre-Kirk, are brought to you by Scott Bakula, Dominic Keating and Conner Trinneer. Bakula established himself in the sci-fi genre with Quantum Leap, and plays Captain Archer in this Star Trek prequel. The trio listed here make for a curiously unique portrayal of first-time deep-space explorers: spanning the extremes from child-like wonder to homeland security. Jolene Blalock provides the first glimpse of human-vulcan inter-play, and looks remarkably 7-of-9 in her uniform, from the neck down. Perhaps the best character is Dr. Phlox, well-played by John Billingsley. Phlox rivals the other Enterprise doctors, holding his own against them all.

B0007PAMR4|3.0|What a missed opportunity Dune was. For perhaps the first time in cinema history, an avant-garde, surrealist filmmaker was given a huge budget to work with. If he'd been left to his own devices, David Lynch might well have created something miraculous. Flawed, probably, but possibly something so unique that it would have easily transcended the likely defects in narrative structure. Unfortunately, producer Dino DeLaurentiis didn't have enough faith in his director to give him license to do as he pleased, and Lynch, as he freely admits now, ended up \\"selling out.\\" To a large degree, Lynch made Dune to please DeLaurentiis rather than himself. For one thing, the director was contractually obligated to turn in a PG-rated film. \\"When you have to avoid an R-rating,\\" said Lynch at the time the film was released, \\"a lot of ideas go out the window.\\" Lynch also did not have final cut on Dune, so the edit taken by the theatrical release probably represents the producer's intentions more than Lynch's. (But let's not be too harsh on DeLaurentiis. With the huge amount of money involved, you can't entirely blame him for wanting to reign in Lynch for fear of ending up with too uncommercial a film. Although, as it happened, the flick flopped anyway. And DeLaurentiis deserves props for staying true to a verbal agreement and allowing Lynch full control and final cut on his next film, the classic Blue Velvet.)    All that being said, Dune is still a worthwhile film. As a whole, it doesn't work very well. But individual elements as well as a few scenes in particular heartbreakingly hint at the masterpiece that might have been. The art direction and cinematography are incredible, working together to create a look unlike any other science fiction film -- dark, shadowy, worn, organic and textured, rather than the usual 2001-derived clean, white, plain and plastic. The best scenes and moments are the most Lynchian ones, which have a wonderful otherworldly feel. In particular: The arresting entrance of the Guild Navigtors into the Emperor's throne room; the hilarious, bizarre scene in which Baron Harkonnen is having his facial pustules tended to by a doctor who speaks in rhyme; the child Alia's assassination of Baron Harkonnen; the mentat Piter DeVries reciting the strange \\"It is by will alone I set my mind in motion\\" verse to himself; the unsettling Bene Gesserit witches; the bizarre contraption that holds a shaved cat that \\"must be milked\\"; the unexplained Harkonnen dwarfs which are doing *something* to a butchered cow, etc.    In addition to the theatrical version, the DVD contains the extended cut that was created for syndicated TV broadcast without the involvement or approval of David Lynch. Although 45 minutes longer, this version actually cuts out some of the best material from the original version, meaning much of the Harkonnen scenes, which I suppose were deemed too weird and perverse for commercial TV. In a misguided effort to make the film easier to follow, they also add intermittent, weirdly folksy voice-over narration that sounds like something out of an old Disney David Crockett film. Since there was no money for it, added shots involving the Fremen feature normal eyes, without the glowing blue effect. So even within the same scene, eyes go from normal to blue to normal as they cut back and forth. The whole thing is pretty shoddy. Even so, the extended cut is worth watching for the scenes that don't appear in the original. Infuriatingly, this version of the film features a noticeably sharper image than the theatrical cut, for some reason.    Overall, this DVD is worth having if you're a die-hard Lynch or science fiction fan, or interested in offbeat filmmaking. But it's depressing when you contemplate what might have been.

006135323X|5.0|This book brought to light many more common sense things of Humans. however he really does a good job putting it into perspective of how Irrational Humans are and how we are repeatedly irrational. Some of the experiments were really eye opening. It is a good read and It helped me understand humanity just a little bit more. I would recommend it to anyone who deals with people on a daily basis and has an open mind for learning and thinking.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|This is literally the first time i've taken the time to write a review about a film.     The plot is not original. The cast are all unknowns, and the racism is rampant..     With that said....         I LOVED THIS FILM.     As many of you have already written, Clint Eastwood and crew deserve all the recognition and notoriety after creating this moving film..     My only critique would be the flagrant use of derogatory terms. But, in hindsight, it ultimately does build to the story of when they start becoming friends and the climax of the movie shifts towards Walt's act of redemption..     To me, this film is masterfully woven together.   You didn't know if he was going to die from the diagnosis he received,   or if he was plotting to go out with guns blazing (dirty harry now driving a gran torino...) Anyone can see from a mile away that he was planning on that night being his final breathe, but, I never would have imagined his selfless act of sacrifice.     Obviously, he's going to the house to seek vengeance for their actions.. But, in a way, I got the sense that his redemption from the korean war was to be killed by those gooks... almost an eye for an eye kind of thing..     But at any rate, those are just some of MY interpretations of the film.   I hope you take the time to view the film, and take it for what it leaves you with..
0440237688|5.0|Just wanted to add my perspective as a mom. Save this book for older children (grade 8 and above) due to content, and because they'll get more out of it. This book appeals equally to adults, and to anyone who enjoys reading about societies that are different from ours (whether futuristic or contemporary). Read it before your children do, and then talk about how this society differs from ours - the pros and the cons, and their reasons for their opinions. My children and I have had some wonderful discussions about what our \\"ideal\\" society would be, what they think their assigned job would be when they turned 12 if they lived in Jonah's world, as well as the reality of being \\"released\\" and its similarities to the Holocaust, and more. Hopefully reading this book together will result in even more interesting discussions with your own children. If your children enjoyed this, they may also enjoy Among the Hidden, by Margaret Haddix.
B001MYIXAW|4.0|This is a delicate modern vampire horror movie. Beautifaully acted and filmed. This is a Swedish film presented with both Swedish and English audio tracks - the dubbing works OK and voice characteration with the lead roles (both children) fits well. It looks like it was filmed on site in a Stokholm suburb and not a studio production which suited me fine. It is a modern day story of a young 12 year old boy, Oskar, who is always getting bullied at school until his friendship with local girl Eli, who happens to be a vampire, starts to change his life for the better. Having a vampire as a best friend can have its drawbacks though. This is all wonderfully acted out by the two main protagonists and captured in HD for BluRay lovers like myself. The audio is English or Swedish 5:1 DTS HD Master and clear as a bell. The film is not a scary movie so much as a film of a haunting modern fairy tale or drama. Definitely worth viewing but not a scare you to death movie.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|AWESOME series. Top notch. I have absolutely no complaints. And it's different enough from the book to still be unexpected. I love it, highly recommended. And Amazon was completely wonderful--fast shipment, AMAZINGLY LOW PRICES!! In stores, it was $45. I bought it MUCH cheaper.
B00241YHMU|4.0|This is a great movie to see on a big screen. Outstanding cinematography. Excellent acting and story. Although a lot of critics didn't really like this film, I was very moved by it. It's a great love story.
B0014YPEI4|5.0|There are many lines of dinosaur figures out there, and Papo is making some of the very finest. This Allosaurus is possibly their best work to date! The sculpting is remarkable; there's not one bit of space on this figure that does not have perfectly-sculpted texture of one kind or another. Even the roof of the mouth is detailed and lifelike. The claw on the innermost finger on each hand is bigger than the others; a nice little piece of accuracy that is usually ignored. The paint work is equally great. There are many different shades of gray, brown, tan, and green lending a very natural appearance to the figure. The interior of the mouth is painted with a glossy paint, giving it a moist appearance. Even tiny parts, such as the teeth, are painted to near-perfection, with almost no slop. This is an excellent rendition of the Allosaurus, and a fine addition to your dinosaur collection. I think this is probably the greatest dinosaur figure I've ever seen, and it is well-worth the money.<br />I would recommend it for children over 10, however, as some of the scales on Al's back are rather sharp, and could result in possible injury to smaller children. That aside, this Allosaurus figure gets my highest possible recommendation.
