B009XTF8JM|5.0|it is a very good film, also it is based on a true story, thats the scarry part, but the performance of the cast is amaizing
B000R8YC18|3.0|This was the first time I have ever watched TAXI DRIVER. Even though I've become a true movie buff / entrepreneur, I realize that sometimes it's better to never watch these &#34;classic&#34; films and simply imagine what they were like in its place and time, than watching them nowadays for the first time with expectations that won't deliver the goods. There are so many of my favorites that came from this time (the 60's) in film history. But the catch is I watched them back then, which makes me appreciate them more now, rather than watching them now, which appreciates me back then. Am I saying that TAXI DRIVER is a bad film? Not exactly.  Did I really watch this movie? Indubitably!  The best part about this flick was seeing younger versions of Rupert Da Nero, Harvey Guitar and Jody &#34;Cannon&#34; Fodder. It's been awhile since I've seen Cyborg Sheepherder too, apparently she's been packing on the chunks over the years, but I haven't seen her myself. It was also great to see Peter Boppins (may he nap peacefully) but I'm beginning to wonder if the man ever had a full skull of working hair follicles. I love Skadaisy's work and own nearly two of his films on HD-DVD. There's no question that what he and Da Nero created here was pure brilliance at the time and again, had I watched this film way back when I was born, I would've understood this stuff much more clearly, but in this day and age a lot about the film just isn't relevant anymore (At one point the guy pays a prostitute with just a twenty dollar bill! The movie about lost me here).  A couple of positive things that really stood out in the movie were the relationship between &#34;Slick&#34; Travis and Ole' Bootsy and the conversation that took place between Travis and the secret service &#34;dude&#34; in Las Vegas. With Travis and Bootsy, well, most people would call Travis a clear-cut hopeless romantic and some of his more colourful ideas he shares with her certainly show this. But this brings me to my first issue, the dude's an underdog taxi driver and she's a successful geologist with options, I just don't see that combo ever cutting the slice. And who in their right mind takes a high society chick (or any chick) around town in a taxi on their first date? But I will say that taking her to a dirty movie was a classy move on his part, even thought she wasn't getting into it like he was. And as for the secret service guy, why did he wait so long to try and apprehend Travis? Red flags galore were going off during their poker game, more than enough to get a dude shot in the face these days, and considering how he gave the guy his real name (Henry Krinckle) and what I think was his real address (123 Fake Street), I don't understand why they weren't beating down his door with handcuffs and tasers.  TAXI DRIVER is an interesting love story, although our main protagonist is clearly supposed to be a likeable character, I had a hard time rooting for him, let alone understanding how things managed to keep working out in his favor throughout the film (except the ending, he totally got what he deserved). I do think they captured the loneliness of working in a factory right on the money, but as far as Travis being a war veteran, well I wasn't completely sold on that. The Hurt Locker was the best journey into the unstable mind of Vietnam Vets for me and I just didn't think Travis came off as that type of person. I will say this though, that all out b/a/l/l/s-to-the-walls dance off at the end was totally awesome. Hip-yeah!  *All fact checking and proof reading was done by Justin Palmure*
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I really love this game, but I keep getting this Marmalade error. If they fix it, I'll give five stars. :-/
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Sucker Punch is simply one of those great little movies that I see myself enjoying for years to come. FALSE. Sucker Punch is actually one of those stupid &#34;artsy&#34; films that make one very p/i/s/s/ed off when viewed through your retinas. With the millions of dollars spent on this drivel, starving children in Idaho could eat entire chickens for days on end, but said monies are rather used for releasing this on DVD where it will be personally snubed the same way women snub me when I say &#34;Hi&#34; to them out on the streets. In other words, it's a complete waste of everyone's time and money, and should be burned in h.e. double hockey sticks for the hour and a half of my life that it has wasted. Not only did this film not make any sense what-so-ever, but it didn't even try to make any valid statements or reflections on our current society. Look at some of the greatest films of all time; Transformers, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Paul Blart: Mall Cop. All of these movies have themes about our current unstable geo-political climate and dependence on technology. I wish I could tell you that this movie offered even a single morsel of an allegory, but other than a scene featuring two women macking out that's an obvious metaphor for our declining economic freedom, there are none &#34;to do&#34; with this movie. At first I thought that this was a movie about suicide, then zombies, then ghosts, then dual identities, then robots, then split personalities, then ninjas, then parallel universes, then robot ninjas, then dragons, and then finally b/o/o/bs. In the end we never know what it was truly about and can be chalked up as a completely and utterly waste of time.  In a perfect world, Sucker Punch would have been life changing. I really did want this movie to be a/n/u/s moistening. I mean those smoking hot actresses put out their whole talents on display and this is what they get in return! A film that supposedly tackles real lifeissues, instead, has some silly story about this girl that can transmorph into different fantastic creatures like tralfamadores. Heck, they could have done a whole MATRIX angle and I still might have dug into it. All I'm saying is that it would have been much more cognitively interesting if we find out that she is in an alternate reality and has to go on some dangerous quest for various items that can help in gaining her freedom. Now that would be a great movie! Visually, there are some thought provoking transitions in this flick, like the one of a dragon chasing an airplane, then to an explosion, then to a hot chick dancing in a brothel kitchen, and then to another explosion, but all of this is for nothing because the movie simply doesn't know what to do with itself. I think the director knows how to show sexy women in interesting ways, set the mood of a scene that involves sexy women, and have interesting comments on the overall state of sexy women in mental institution, but the man either had a shasty script or was on some kind of mind augmenting dopamine that elevated him onto another state and plane of incoherent passive thoughts. I'm super p/i/s/s/ed and you would be too if you saw this film. So please, don't be bamboozled by this movies allure of deep metaphysical contemplations, because it just ain't there.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Love this show, wish that the final season was available with Prime at no cost, I'm not paying $2.99 an episode.  Let me know when the price drops down to $0.00

B0052AC8C6|5.0|2nd only to Wal-E!<br />Good for all ages but obviously intended for kids.<br />Great animation  and excellent production value.<br /><br />Woot!
B008MIMWOO|4.0|Campy, Cheeseball, downright stupid?<br /><br />Plenty of ways to describe Austin Powers.<br /><br />All three, in HD, for a reasonably price though?<br /><br />No complaints.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Just buy it and no question... see why there 5 stars reviews.... no complain much.. buy it and you will HAPPY...  Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G (SGH-T699) Android 4.0.4
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|If you liked CtR, you'll enjoy CtR:E.  My biggest complaint about it would be the addition of the &#34;Super powers&#34;.<br /><br />All the levels have solutions, most are reasonably simple (once you look at it sideways), however after you've failed a few times, it trys to nudge you into buying powers, which apparently are just blatant cheats?  I don't know.
B0000BXGCN|5.0|We love the music of Lara Fabian.  The disc was in great condition and we play it often.  What a voice!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Very good game sensitivity could be a lot faster nice colours but more good good goog get great good goog good game video good
B005FHXB0O|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie. Written by Tarantino, its all about great dialog! And constant action, perfect amount of my kind of romance with a high body count. And a star studded cast.<br /><br />Love<br />this<br />movie!
0062127241|3.0|As a longtime Who and Pete Townshend fan, I have to say that this book was a big letdown.  I expected to hear some &#34;behind the music&#34; type stories.&#34;  What I got was an aging rocker alternating about how much he had to do with every major advancement in music and his depression and spiritual faith.  This book could have used a ghost writer to help pull out some real material and Glyn Johns to edit and put this material in a more coherent order.  I guess I shouldn't be all that suprised as Pete has always been full of himself.  I thought that at this advanced age he might take a different look upon his life.
0345803485|2.0|Poorly written, childish, annoying. I do not understand what the hype is about these books. This is the last time I buy books that the &#34;general public&#34; is raving about.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|great movie highly recommend to those who have not seen it, even if u have this version has extras that add to the story.
1455523550|5.0|I've read only 2 books so far from Nicholas Sparks. This was the second. From start to finish, I could not put this book down. His typical books are a character (main) dies and all love is lost. But this book has suspense and was all in all a great book. Seeing the movie this weekend and can't wait
B006S08RLU|5.0|Love Audrey Tautou.  She is really good in everything I have seen.  This is a very avant-garde movie which is delightful!
B000PKX2KA|3.0|Windows 8 would not accept the unit.  Windows 7 would not find the item.  Needed it right away, tried to make it work ran out of time, got call from seller advising me I should have called them first.  There was a driver needed to make it work.  Pressed for time, seller did good, product needed more information.  Might work but returned it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this. Great ideas and tips for everything I am interested in. I think you should be able to tag people in your pins when you want others to see things.
B00447G29S|5.0|I was read this story when I was younger, and I will read it to my kids when I have them. In addition to the story, I can now also show them the movie.  I loved this movie since it came out.  I was dissapointed to see the first 3D version came with the blue and red glasses, however after seeing that this edition is the new &#34;real&#34; 3D version like every other 3D movie these days, I had to get it.  It's a great story and I'm happy to add this to my collection!
B001ILHY2C|5.0|This movie definitely has a good storyline, there was never a dull moment.<br />The bluray is excellent as well, the sound will blow your speakers away.<br />The delivery through Amazon was very prompt, great service as always! Thanks!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|The ending confusing a bit but other than than a great sequel..on the third already (: these books are great
B0031TZ8TU|4.0|This is an amazing story of the American spirit, but it could have been about 100 pages shorter by taking out the plenitude of unnecessary facts.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great better then temple run definitely a surprise improvement to the hall of games!i also love the incredible graphics.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I went to this movie with no positive or negative expectations.  It didn't take long until I was drawn in, taken away, and immersed in one of the great experiences of my life.  That may sound a little over the top, but rarely have I been so deeply moved.  Truly a masterpiece.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway suffers it is a very good game and can help you with you skills aka you finger and hand muscles and movements...

B0011UJMK2|4.0|Child 44 is the first installment of a trilogy spanning the life of Leo, a Soviet secret policeman who finds his loyalty to the greater good of the Soviet state at odds with his humanity and conscience.  In the midst of this realization, Leo bucks the system in a major way to pursue a serial killer responsible for the deaths of more than 44 children.  Since murder can not occur in the utopian state under Stalin, each case has been covered up or blamed on one of society's undesirables.  There's some bad PR for the Stalin and post-Stalin eras, but there are enough historical facts to make it believable.  I thought it was good enough to continue with The Secret Speech and Agent 6, which take us up to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.  These are great reads that will keep you coming back for more.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Woo Hoo I love this game it is fun & keeps your attention like some other games do not. It gives you the things that you need to advance without having to purchase them. Thanks gameloft

B004I2K4E8|5.0|This is my favorite production of Les Mis. While Nick Jonas kinda stinks it up, all the other singers more than make up for it, especially Jean Valjean!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is by far my favorite game on my kindle, at first i liked temple run but when i discovered it i was hooked on this game.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run 2 was one of the best sequel apps!! It's a lot more challenging and so much fun to play on my tablet. :) The adjustments made to the scoring made a huge difference to me. So much less confusing n easy to manage! I love Temple Run 2!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I know, I know... you plate if full. All of those IT issues are keeping you up at night. Maybe there is a better way.  In The Phoenix Project, a better way to manage your IT shop unfolds right before your eyes as a novel that you just can't put down. I'm on my second read. But reading it will not be enough! You will have to put what you learned into practice.  I kicked off a discussion group on LinkedIn to discuss this book and share best practices. Just look for \\"The Phoenix Project: A Novel Discussion Group\\" on LinkedIn. See you there!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My daughter likes this game but needs a lot of help with it. I would say this game is good for an adult fan or kids over 7
B000028U0Y|5.0|I generally don't listen to &#34;country&#34; music, but Johnny Cash transcends. This album has rock, blues, ballads, country...stir them up and you have a delicious musical stew. (Even The Beatles could have performed some of these tunes.) You can't help but get energized or put the pedal to the metal listening to &#34;Cocaine Blues&#34; (don't be misled by the song title), while &#34;Long Black Veil&#34; is truly moving. Out of the 19 or so songs, I might skip through two or three slower numbers in the second half only because they're a little redundant, but that leaves at least 15 great tunes. Makes me wish I was in the clink, for a day anyway, so I could have been there to experience it live.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This is a great movie. Clint Eastwood is always great both as a director and an actor. Well worth the watch
B000FC10MU|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Neil Gaiman at his best.Buy this book you will be glad you did.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Enjoyed this game a lot. I would definitely recommend it for others to play and enjoy. The graphics are great and makes the game more enjoyable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best app ever!!!!! It's one of those games when u jus wanna play it all day. It's really easy my 3 year old bro can play it. really addicting and fun I love it! U will like it if u like temple run, follow ariannakinz14 on instagram!!
B0034G4OYK|5.0|My kids and I love this movie - fun for the whole family and great voice overs by an all-star cast. Was a little disappointed that this only included UltraViolet and not also Digital Copy for iTunes, but UltraViolet seems to work ok on our Flixster app.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have always enjoyed various Mahjong games and was glad to be able to download it to my new Kindle Fire.
0316212261|4.0|There are so many steampunk knockoff writers who think it's sufficient to throw in a steam engine and some funny glasses to make me care. Yes, there are plenty of funny eyeglasses and steam-driven devices. There's also a rich world-building here with its own logical &#34;rules&#34; - how are werewolves and vampires different? What kind of power could you have if you chose not to use carbon fuels?<br /><br />I loved the costume descriptions, the snarky heroine, and the rich lively humor above all.<br /><br />I devoured all of the books and wish there were more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My kids love this game! This is a very kid friendly and fun game. we love to play this game its very fun and really addictive.
0307341550|5.0|I honestly could not put the book down! I read tons of books but this one still has my head spinning. The characters are extreme in everyway. the graphic detail and use of harsh language is amazing. It is a vivd and tragic novel. Not an easy light read if you get what I mean. I enjoyed this one very very much. I cannot wait to read \\"Gone Girl\\" next.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|i love killing the bad piggies, but it's also fun to liberate the kidnapped birds. this game is awesome! cracks me up!
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Switching between pencil and pen marks took me a game or two to get used to, but after that the game plays great.  Very responsive to the touch.  Hard to put it down.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone.  This is a quality product.  I will purchase more at another time. Great deal and price
B00729GQ0A|5.0|For me it was all about the writing, the words, how they got me. The Forever Girl was a book that held me so close, at the end I felt I'd moved in and was living there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is great but I cant update this on a Kindle Fire so I cant join multiplayer games :(

B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like the app a LOT, but whenever I update it deleted everything! I AM SOOOOOOO ANNOYED at this, and I really hats that. Also, I wont automatically update the app. If the developers are reading this, FIX IT. I spent $10 on coins, and this is very, very, VERY annoying. Please fix it!!!
B0001ZXM54|5.0|ZZ Top is a band that plays rock had one of the best. It is a vibrant sound.Yes I would recommend buying.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Fun game can connect with fb friends or choose a player online for you. It does freeze up some times on my kindle he.

B007THA4FI|1.0|Very disappointing from the author of the Harry potter series that captivated me.  Not much to like about the characters.  I probably should have put the book down before I got halfway through. I hope for something better the next time. I will not preorder.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|this is the first book in the series and I enjoyed it.  The number of characters introduced is large, but once you get past that the book is great.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I do not recommend this to anyone. I like the workouts but they do not work, I did not see any results, even thought I was following the diet plan and everything.... Very disappointed
B0058YPL66|5.0|The story-telling in the first season of this show is excellent.  Each episode has a self-contained plot with a beginning, middle and end, but all tie together into an over-arching story which culminates in the season finale in a very satisfying way.  Before the show first began, I thought it would just be a rip-off of &#34;Fables&#34; by Bill Willingham (also worth checking out, by the by), but that fear proved unfounded.  There are some general similarities, but the characters are utilized entirely differently and the plot is different.  A wonderfully done sci-fi soap opera.
086547897X|5.0|Every animator should have this book so if you don't have it, go and buy it. It has everything you need to be a successful animator
B0083SBJXS|5.0|After the Oscar ceremony, my fiance declared that while the choices were decent, &#34;the people have spoken.&#34;  The Avengers is the third highest grossing film of all time, and it is for a reason.  Fantastically entertaining, appealing to the mind and to the heart, this film is an example of the best version of what popular culture can be.
B00170F0WU|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies, and has a cute love story.  Very well made, and Gary Oldman is wonderful as the insane cop.  One of the movies I watch again, every few months.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Following a brilliant Freshman album, this Sophmore offering was the primary CD in my car for months after release.  An excellent performance.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I love this CD. He is so real and true. More rappers should have lyrics like this. I hope he's around for a long time.
144234430X|4.0|I liked it.  Not scary, but a thriller nonetheless.  Audio books are such a different experience from books one reads.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so much fun!! Whenever Im bored, I just play it. I love how there are missions you have to complete, and I love the mystery boxes and the different people--I guess you could just say that I love EVERYTHING about it!
B00A1U2SVS|1.0|a couple of friends and relatives gave this great reviews, so I bought it. Robert Plant still sings good, but he's no longer the Golden God he once was. Jimmy Page is still a good guitar player, just not the best in the world anymore, and his ego won't let any other guitarists on stage with him, even though many Zep songs have guitar overdubs on the studio albums and would sound better with 2 or even 3 guitars on stage would have been awesome. This bass is muddy but the drums are loud and okay.
0312117337|5.0|This deck I use to choose a card for advice and works wonderfully.<br />Usually the card is exactly what the consultant needs to hear and it´s a great way of ending a session.<br />The cards and book are of excellent quality.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Title says it all... this game really is the best ever. The last game like this that I loved used to be temple run, but now I like this game SOOO much more
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|With Tommy Lee Jones, Meryl Streep and Steve Carrell - this movie had all the potential in the world . . . but it sadly fell flat.  Instead of highlighting the nuances of married life, the story primarily centers on the inability of the couple to have sex - not a plot line that can really carry a 2 hour film.  I was very disappointed, and would not recommend.
B009G78EE2|4.0|Honestly, I've never heard of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis until about 3 days ago.  I'm not a hip youngster anymore, and I guess I need to brush up on my Youtubing skills (dude has 120 million views for his &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; song).  I found this album through Amazon's deal of the day for $1.99  I listened to the first couple songs and enjoyed them, an impressive album for being a completely independent release (from what I hear).
B001PJRAUS|1.0|Like many others, I was interested in the concept of the switch between a modern day girl and Elizabeth Bennet. This could be interesting! But...<br /><br />It was a disappointment. SPOILERS below.<br /><br />I didn't like how the movie played out. It sends out the wrong message: If you hate your real life love life--maybe a magic door will appear and you'll nab the fictional man of your dreams while ruining everyone else's life in the process. Forget about your real life and just abandon that guy who wants to marry you in the real world!<br /><br />I didn't find the Amanda Price character to be likeable at all. I can understand how her presence can alter events but it didn't explain why all the characters were making out-of-character choices. I don't understand what was so appealing about her and why every character was falling in love with her.<br /><br />Lastly, If you love the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth, then don't watch this movie. It's nonexistent here.<br /><br />The only thing I liked about this movie and why I gave it 1 star was Tom Mison as Charles Bingley. Adorable. :)
B000QUCNP4|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this story, I remembered when it was all happening.  But the film itself is very visually and unnecessarily dark and grainy at times.  There is no reason for interior room scenes to be that dark....I kept wanting to scream &#34;turn on a light, idiot&#34;, and so that was all very distracting.  Good acting by all, just difficult viewing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks books are always a great read.  It was different from his other books.  The subject matter is disturbing but he did a terrific job depicting all of the characters.
B00333NCTM|5.0|How is this man still alive? I really enjoyed this book. It's very frank, funny and honest. A must read for any Ozzy and Black Sabbath fan.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I like the choices you have with this game and the grapics are well done for a free game.  Would recommend.
B009GED3HS|4.0|I rented the &#34;standard definition&#34; (aka 480i) Season 8, Episodes 2 through 6 last weekend.  The overall quality of the downloads was good, but the first few seconds of each episode were not included.  I tried to rewind, but the content is not there.  So only 4 out of 5 stars!<br /><br />If you are a fan of the show, you know the narrator (Bob Saget) talks to his kids at the beginning of most episodes, and tells them what the episode is about.  You'll miss that!  It's a simple sit-com though, so you'll eventually figure it out, but it's a little dissapointing.  I think Amazon's &#34;auto-rip&#34; machine needs to do a better job!
B002361MLA|5.0|This book helps one find a spiritual identity without being religious. Might need to reread to keep focused and in touch with my being.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I love the writing, the harmonies, the heart in this music. I highly recommend it. I'm looking forward to what this band does in what I'm sure will be a stellar future!
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|An unexpected delight.  The &#34;miscasting&#34; is intriguing and works well.  Helen Mirren with a tommy gun - somehow it works.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 9 year old LOVES this game!  It is easy to navigate and very entertaining. It's a great game! Fun!
0385342063|5.0|Kinsella is soooooo funny.<br />Her characters are always lying to protect their faults and her books are always a wonderful scaped from the real world.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There really isn't anything I can say other than it's pretty cool to be able to follow along with this app
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Good designed calculator but needs more controls. No fraction or decimal keys or things like that. It's no college calculator but is worth it!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is the Godfather Trilogy on Blu-Ray there is no way you could go wrong. Great sound, great picture. And I got a great deal to boot. Lots of extras in this set. I Highly Recommend!
B007VPLNGW|4.0|Pretty addictive and is challenging. Good graphics and gets to the point. Suggest for 6 and up. Would be cool if there was a sequel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice for a simple animal care game.  Graphics not to bad either.  Nice to be able to own a horse in the city,lol.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The ending was a little drawn out but I enjoyed the story. It had enough highs and lows to keep you entertained.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A great read with tons of technical detail nicely balanced with a plot that reaches out to the deep inner survival instinct in all of us. I was hooked from page 1.
1616550414|5.0|Amazing book, a must have for any Legend of Zelda fan. Beautiful artwork and content, definitely worth it at such a cheap price!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Pillars has always been a book that I regret I'll never read again for the first time.  World Without End does well to follow that path even if it can't quite equal the originial, it's still well worth the time.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|We loved this movie when it first came out<br />looked around to try and find it on blu ray<br />movie looks even m<br />better in hd
B005PK553C|5.0|If u like scary movies this is something u should see.<br />I have watch it about five times already especially home invation and piggy as well as holloween part one and two.
B00867GHS8|5.0|great movie at the best price around.<br />This movie is spectacular in 3D.<br />Would recommend that you buy this move
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Only problem is the ads interrupt my game in the middle of a jump??  Other that I love it it's like caring for your own horse...
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What an amazing book.  Great characters, great message, great read.  I'm a Middle School teacher, and I feel as though every middle school student should read this book.  You instantly love the kind characters, and you root for Auggie, making you reflect on your own actions and ask yourself &#34;what would I do in this situation?&#34;  Thoughtful and moving, this book really is a wonder.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It gets updates all the time the only bad thing is you can not get the nether brick/ack or the block of the white stuff that looks like a white watermelon
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I'll start off by saying that I spent a lot of time reading reviews and specs on this mouse and was expecting greatness.. and I was massively disappointed. I have large hands as it is, and this mouse was annoyingly awkward to use. If you look at the shape of it, it almost looks as if it were designed for someone who is left handed... look at the pictures that amazon provides and do some googling to see how the mouse is shaped.. it does not make sense as far as ergonomics and I felt it immediately when using it. I'm a claw type mouse user and this mouse is really ONLY for people who have their entire hand smothering the mouse the entire time they use it.<br /><br />The drivers are also garbage... The software that you have to download from Anker's website made the mouse even worse.  I spent hours messing around with the DPI, acceleration, Mouse point speed, default profiles, etc... I really could not find anything to make this mouse work the way I was using it (it was their latest software too).<br /><br />That being said... if you are a palm mouse-smothering user... this is your mouse.  It's got a ton of customization features, and I really liked that I could stop the logo from pulsing etc.<br /><br />For $40.00 unfortunately it is not worth it, in my honest opinion. I will be returning it and trying the Feenix Nascita mouse.  The Nascita goes for ~$100 so hopefully it is the mouse to end all mouses.<br /><br />My advice to Anker would be to relook the shaping of this mouse. It would be hard to explain in words how I'd reshape it but as a right handed person, the mouse is more comfortable to use in my left.. it makes no sense at all!<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Edit 03/07/13<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />After I left my review, I was contacted by Erin at Anker, I was very surprised to be contacted by them since, normally, companies really don't care about your opinion of their product.  Erin was fantastic to deal with. She explained that Anker is really trying to make this mouse perfect for all of its users and really valued my input. Customer service goes a long way as far as I'm concerned, and now that I've gotten used to the mouse, it's actually not bad at all. I've found a comfortable position to use the mouse and by playing around with the software settings a bit more, I was able to find a nice DPI setting and button arrangement.  One thing that I should have noted in my original review was the placement of the side buttons on the mouse (where your thumb would go).. are absolutely perfect for either a palm or claw grip which is great when it comes to customization.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to any new products Anker is planning on coming out with and would still love to see a remodeled version of this mouse. As I said before, customer service goes a long way, so if Anker is able to continue this level of customer service that I've received, then I will definitely buy from them again.ies really don't care about your opinion of their product.

B003730LRY|5.0|This is a funny movie about the Adams family.  Anyone who watched the original shows would love to see this.  The cast was great and funny.  I recommend this for the family.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i have no complaints so far for  this  game! it is very realistic and simple so you can play at your own pace.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is very addictive and has lots of objectives to keep you occupied I recommend this game for all age groups
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I like this book because it had like a lot of action. My favorite part has to be when Dorothy and Toto were finding scarecrow,tin man, and lion. If my friends were to ask me what book to read I would say read The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Most awesome book evaaaaaa. You should totally download this book if you are in to myths and stuff like that.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Great story line, great cast---every episode is worth watching and rewatching. Can't wait for season five to come out--loved it!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book has helped me understand why both me and my spouse are unhappy in our marriage. I have always had a critical nature and it has had a negative impact over time. I now realize that some of my negative responses towards my husband were because he was not providing what I need to el e loved. Low and behold, turns out I an not providing the love he needs. We are not speaking each other's love language. This book had provided concrete approaches to learn both you and your spouse's love language.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney did it again. I look to you is my favorite song on this disc. You will love this CD!
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|Conan the Barbarian fans unite; this is the soundtrack score we have all been waiting for! While I owned the previous two recordings, as well as the newly recorded full orchestral version released in 2011, once I discovered this complete, original recording had been located and mastered onto CD I snatched up a copy (via  Screen Archives Entertainment) and in less than five days it was mine.<br /><br />Not only is the sound \\"masterful\\", but listening to it as it was first conducted by Basil Poledouris, I was transported back to 1982 when I first saw the film, and at times, through the music, even further back to when Conan trod the earth. If you only have room for one version of this score in your collection, after the vinyl LP of course, this is the one to own!<br /><br />By Crom, we've waited long enough!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Looking forward to reading the next book and continuing the story.<br />I'm sure it won't be a disappointment judging by the first..
B00AV68GOA|5.0|My wife are late-comers to the Downton Abbey phenomena, only recently watching Series 1 and 2.  I have always enjoyed reading scripts from TV shows and movies, watching deleted scenes, and listening to commentaries, so I did not hesitate to purchase this when it became available. Having access to lines and scenes that were cut from the final production gave additional insights into the characters and answered some of the questions that I had while watching Series 1. The commentary by Julian Fellowes is priceless and helped an American who was not too familiar with the customs of those times gain a better understanding of the lifestyle they enjoyed.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Voice, memories, era, tribute....it's all in this film about a regular and special human being.  Good thing people remember special voices and humanity.

B009EJSUBY|5.0|This Complete Album Collection contains the complete recordings than Van Cliburn made as pianist for RCA, plus a documentary on DVD.  It does not include his sole recording made as a conductor (issued in 1965 on a limited edition LP), nor recordings that have turned up on other labels.<br /><br />By the time I became aware of Van Cliburn he had already retired, and my co-workers at the Classical record store where I was employed dismissed him as a \\"burn out\\".  It wasn't until some of his recordings were issued on SACD hybrid discs that I began to listen to his recordings.<br /><br />Despite Cliburn's All-American, apple pie loving boy from Texas image, his musical training was solidly in the Russian School.  It's not for nothing that his teacher was Rosina Lh&eacute;vinne, doyenne of Russian piano teachers.<br /><br />Listening anew to these recordings, it's also easy to see why he won the Tchaikovsky Competition in 1958.  Cliburn had technique to burn, but never felt the need to get into a speed race - even when he played such warhorses as Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto.  Yet it's Cliburn's recording of that concerto which brings a lump to my throat at the final statement of the third movement's \\"big tune.\\"  Cliburn was among the most sincere of interpreters.  He didn't feel the need to drown his performances in eccentricity, yet one can instantly tell it's Cliburn performing.  His temperament ran warm, but not hot like Rubinstein's and certainly not molten like Horowitz's.  In many ways, Cliburn resembled Benno Moiseiwitsch, the master of relaxed virtuosity.  Also, Cliburn's ringing sonority reminded many of Rosina Lh&eacute;vinne's husband, Josef.  (Vladimir Horowitz once remarked that he and Arthur Rubinstein together couldn't match Cliburn's tone.)<br /><br />Let's get one thing out of the way, Cliburn was a good musician - not a one hit wonder.  There is a misconception, mostly centered in the Germanic circles, that one has to be a great Mozart and Beethoven interpreter to be a great musician.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Much of this stems from Artur Schnabel's statement that he limited his repertoire to music that was \\"better than it could be played.\\"  There are plenty of Romantic works that are \\"better than they can be played\\".  Fact is, there have been plenty of pianists who turn in fine performances of various Beethoven and Mozart works - including Cliburn for the most part.  (There are also plenty of pianists who have been lauded for their Beethoven, Mozart, and Schubert interpretations for no good reason.)  There are not many pianists who can hold together the Liszt Sonata, or make as strong a case as Cliburn does for the original 1913 version of Rachmaninoff's Second Sonata.<br /><br />As with any recorded legacy, there are high, middle, and low points.  The Rachmaninoff Third Concerto, a warm, lyrical performance that proves the piece is more than a pianistic warhorse, belongs in every record collection - despite a rather lackluster accompaniment from the Symphony of the Air.  Cliburn makes the best case I've heard for the heavier, chordal cadenza.  The Prokofieff Sixth Sonata and Barber Sonata rank with the best - and the Brahms Handel Variations is one of my favorite versions.  Many of the other recordings, including works by Chopin, Liszt, and the impressionists, rank as solid but seldom first choices - of course, the same thing could be said about the bulk of Vladimir Ashkenazy's copious output.  The low point for me was the opening movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, played rather loudly and lacking in atmosphere.<br /><br />Cliburn was wise enough to know his limitations and be selective in the music he chose to present to the public. Chronologically and stylistically, the repertoire here starts with Mozart and ends with Barber's Piano Sonata.  Cliburn didn't embrace serialism or twelve-tone because music without a \\"line\\" didn't speak to him.  Nor did he play much chamber music.  Instead, he concentrated on the core Romantic solo and concerto repertoire - and he played it very well.<br /><br />While many know-it-alls crowed over Cliburn's retirement, at least he knew when enough was enough.  That can't be said for many of the intellectual crowd's pantheon of musical heroes - including Claudio Arrau and Rudolf Serkin, great artists who should have left the stage years before they did.  Then there are those who shouldn't have begun in the first place.<br /><br />As with many of their recent reissues, Sony has organized this set to match the original LPs - which means short playing times - and included the original cover art.  A perceptive essay by Jed Distler is also included.  The recordings do not sound newly remastered, but Cliburn got better sound at RCA than many of his contemporaries at that label did - everything is acceptable sonically., he concentrated on the core Romantic solo and concerto repertoire - and he played it very well.<br /><br />While many know-it-alls crowed over Cliburn's retirement, at least he knew when enough was enough.

All round great story
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Helps kill time in a very enjoyable way!  Anyone who loves horses will enjoy it. It can be frustrating in some areas if you are running it on a small screen,  but still worth it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is cool.I like temple run and the running games so this is the one. If you like temple run or even running games you would enjoy this game guarenteed.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Once again Morgan rice keeps us wanting more. This series is great. I can not wait to see what happens next. I haven't anticipated a kings death this much since King Joffery!!!
B004J4WLPU|4.0|I was able to connect with these sisters and their mother so much. Fell in love with Bea's imperfections.  Her grief was so palpable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its fun and I love the upgrades and I think it is great for me and my sisters!!!!! the new upgrade should be.... Costa Rica I like that soccer team
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is a great way to talk to friends and family. You can have groups chats ,take photos and share videos. Kik me at CheyenneBreezy I'll live to here from ya!

B003ZSJ212|5.0|A Great saga!<br />I had seen individual parts before but never the full thing, and I can say it was awesome!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought the first book was great the second one is even better if you can believe that can't wait for the third one.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I really enjoy watching Eragon grow and mature in this book.  The challenges faced and the issues he deals with are intriguing.  While Eragon is a hero in this book, he is not alone, he has a lot of help and realizes it.
1781164266|5.0|The art book is really impressive. It's very detailed and full of new and interesting info on the series. Definitely recommend this to fans.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The plug in works great, it is just a shame the &#34;new&#34; kindle are not as easy to use as before. I have had difficulty with signing on and other issues...not pleased with this product.
0307887448|3.0|But there are themes and messages, especially in the last line of the book, that really damage the story.  It celebrates geek culture throughout but also has a tendency to look down on the parts of it the writer doesn't understand.  A book so reliant on the things geeks love should not take such a stance against certain aspects.  Loved the ideas and the references and the competition/egg hunt.  But it didn't quite make it to perfection thanks to an attempt to push an anti-virtual agenda.  Note that I would rate this a 3.5 out of 5, not a 3, but .5 ratings are not possible on Amazon.
B000KUD2G4|3.0|I think it is? But I can't really tell. It is well built and seems sturdy. I left it in my signal chain. Doesn't hurt but I&#34;m not sure if it's helping?
0399157565|1.0|This is the 22nd book I have read written by Ms. Cornwell; I have very much enjoyed every one. Not this one.<br />Seems like most of my favourite authors; that I have been reading for the last 20 years have lost their magic. Eg., Deaver, Patterson ( co-written novels) and Grisham.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I purchased this book because it was only $1 for the Kindle version. The Irish setting and characters were charming--especially Jamie's neighbors/best friends. The story was pleasantly told and well-written, but progressed quite slowly so I found myself getting bored at times. In contrast, the flashbacks about Jamie's time in the orphanage were highly emotional. The rawness and depth were jarring in comparison to the rest of the narrative, almost like these sections didn't quite fit with the rest of the story--even though I felt this is where the author was at her best.<br />All in all, I enjoyed The Misremembered Man and found the ending particularly satisfying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game in the world!  So much fun and entertaining!  I could play it all the time.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|This app gets me to Wiki faster, helps me to access information more readily and easily by allowing the resizing of pages, for example. It quite simply helps me to do something I want to do. In this case, I want to get to Wiki.  The value of doing this is relative.  For me, getting to Wiki has value. While not as venerable as my old multi-volume Britannica, Wiki is far more convenient, light-weight, and, above all, inexpensive!  It's not quite as even in tone, style, or reliability, of course.  It's quite obvious that the different articles are written by different authors with varying talents.  But, as long as it is used judiciously, but not slavishly, I think Wiki is a fantastic reference tool and this app quite simply makes it easier for me to use it, and it does so without taking up too much space, without troubling other apps or the OS. All of this = FIVE STARS!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly can do no wrong by me, this book was another one of his home runs,couldn't put it down.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I  am the first to admit that I don't know all that much about security software.  My previous experience has been only with Norton on my office computers.  I honestly didn't want all those fancy bells and whistles on my tablet.  I wanted security and safety without fuss!  Time, of course, will tell, but right now I am feeling pampered with Avast working unobtrusively in the background while I play happily on my Kindle.  It was easily installed.  Its controls were easily set.  It's completely compatible with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and asks little to nothing from me.  It warns me if it perceives danger.  It takes care of me!  I'm happy!  AND IT WAS FREE!  What's not to like?  Besides, if it ever fails to do its job, I'll kill it.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A lovely story. A little slow at first but definitely gets more interesting as it progresses. I would recommend it to readers that enjoy human interest stories.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Babkoonosh happy to you. I heart t. Run 2 and so will you.
0307744434|2.0|I would describe this book as pretty but dull. It is fixated on the details of the circus, fashion, color, texture, etc. It paints a beautiful image. But after the first hundred pages of pretty, I was ready for something more, which never arrived. The plotline moves extremely slowly, and doesn't really escalate or conclude at all satisfyingly. There aren't really bigger philosophical issues being explored, or character development. The magic system isn't particularly innovative, or well-explained. For me, a book that is just pretty without much else going for it doesn't measure up. I forced myself to finish it, but I shouldn't have -- halfway through I was completely bored.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I have never read zombie books. This was a great read though. The characters were well used. A few times I even felt I was there.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I will admit, I liked her Tim McGraw song and pretty much nothing else since then.  This album isn't bad!  She reminds me most of the singer/songwriter genre.  I hear no country on this album and really only some pop.  She really has impressed me with this one.  And unlike some of her last work, this album revolves less around stalking boys who are dating other people and more about more adult-type relationships (good and bad).
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Awesome story ~ Disney never fails to delight young and old alike!  Enjoy this story as a family.  You won't regret it!<br /><br />Wonderful and prompt delivery!
B00AA0U05A|5.0|The song selection and instrumentation on Rossum's \\"Sentimental Journey\\" CD are perfect for showcasing her incredible voice. I love it!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|What more can be said ~ we loved it!  This is another great film from Disney and make for a wonderful family time.<br /><br />Delivery was impecable.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love this app....we all enjoy playing it.  Only problems we have is when they moved from New York to Rio, we lost all rewards, trophies, characters and statuses, and hard to start completely over. Sometimes the app will skip and 9 out of 10 times we will crash into something and die.  If these quirks would be fixed, this app would be fantastic and rated 5 stars.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|DVD was in nice condition and showed excellent.....a great deal...This was well worth the money and it was exactly as promised....thank you!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I'm not a fan of the rap genre at all. But I absolutely adore this album. The lyrics are smart,relatable and presented in super appealing and original way. Hope Macklemore keeps it coming because I love this release.
B001RIY49C|5.0|Awesome, this sits on the shelf next to my &#34;alien&#34; head and my planet of the apes &#34;ape&#34; head. A Great film evoking wonderfull popcorny memories, an effects laden treat which works beautifully alongside its more horror driven b-movie predecessor. Arnies finest hour, and a 6 disc box set worthy of a film which entertained me during my childhood...Hasta la vista, baby!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|As this is one of my favorite series of movies ever, I jumped at the chance to take advantage of the 'Todays Deal' offered by Amazon. Great price and timely delivery. Thanks, Amazon!

B005CRQ4GU|1.0|this book is so not for kids. i hate valantines day candy is bad. its just boring.nobody will read this i hate it i like captain underpants
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie was REALLY good. I was not expecting much and was really impressed by it. I do find it sad when a great movie is overlooked. It's perfectly violent and Karl Urban makes an EXCELLENT Judge Dredd.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I am soo glad I read this before the movie.  I am also happy I had little knowledge of what this story was about.  I really enjoyed it.  Thank you susan Morris lahey for the great boom suggestion.  Everybody hopes for the silver lining.
B00783NWB6|5.0|This movie is excellent. It's so rare that a movie this late in a series could possibly be my favorite one of them all. If you liked any of the other movies in the series you need to watch this one. Just my $.02...
B008220C38|3.0|... tried to watch this movie the first time and could not remain interested enough to continue.  tried a second time, with absolutely NO expectations, and enjoyed it much more; for the most part.  as one reviewer implied, it was chocked to the brim with style and as my own beloved grandmother would have said; twas a lot of  \\"artsy-fartsy-ness\\".  this movie is best bought on sale or borrowed from a friend. it was visually beautiful, but very SLOW to become interesting ... which it ultimately did ... i liked most: some \\"play\\" at a night at the theater ...
B005LAII8A|5.0|Yes to-days movies are far greater than the oldies but wait for it, they are far better than to-days if the effects were created back than. Time travel is very interesting and can put you in the mood for something unusual as this show is, thrills and spills action  with the works thrown in. The cast did a fantastic job performing their roles that put you  there with them,  edge of the seat feelings testing your nerves who was going to win or lose. Great entertainment worth putting your feet up relaxing with the munchies, enjoying every minute of a marvelous movie well what are you doing, get to it. what you waiting for I'm not telling you everything as to spoil it. Explore find out and judge for yourself.
1419707671|5.0|my grandson loves diary of a wimpy kid, now he has the whole collection.  great reading for children.<br />made a great christmas present.
B004I744AS|5.0|Wonderful resource. I can quickly find words and their definitions and usage. I love the daily facts and word games as well.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|Great read that makes you feel a little closer to Woz himself. Much more light hearted and fun than Jobs' biography (which was great in it's own right) this tells the story from the other guy. It's excellent.<br /><br />I always liked Woz but reading this book just affirms it. It describes some ups and downs but is mostly an honest look back at a life of a genius who changed the world and never really aspired to. Good stuff.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS WONDERFUL I WISH I COULD PLAY IT EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE  BED TIME
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Fun, good music and entertaining for the family. The addition of amazon instant copies as well as the ultraviolet, DVD and blurry discs make this an excellent bargain.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loooooooove this app so much!! it great and really addicting . its like temple run but a bit easier. great for kids
B009G78EE2|5.0|I bought the whole album for $2, and I'd probably have paid full-price for it. Very catchy beats, good flow, and a nice mix of slow and fast songs. Will be on my work/workout rotation for the next several weeks, easily.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a great romantic read with a twist at the end. It had a nice setup and a thrilling end.One of the roller coster reads!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|The plastic doesn't get stuck in my scrubs or jean pockets, it easily protects against drops on hard tile and asphalt, and it doesn't block larger USB cables or audio plugs like other cases. Plus, it comes with a screen protector!<br /><br />It's not nearly as cool as my Speck Candyshell, but it's easily more durable and less prone to breakage (especially around the Apple connector, which broke on three different Speck cases I've owned). The spiral design on the back reflects some of the light when you use the flash, so that's cool.
B000S88JTS|5.0|I have wanted to see this for many years. I finally purchased it and have no regrets. Great movie to make you want to get out and roost some sand and mud!
1449512569|5.0|I bought the book for my husband who REALLY likes Chesterton. Talks about his witticisms constantly and comments about something in the book every time EVERY time he reads any of it.
0345525558|5.0|I expected this book to be somewhat romantic and perhaps Jane Austen-esque, but it wasn't.  I found the book to be an interesting way to look at a girl who had gone through a lot and found it inspiring that such a little thing, flowers, were able to speak to her and keep her going even during the worst times. It was interesting that this was the way she communicated with the outside world. I didn't love Gone Girl but absolutely enjoyed The Language of Flowers.  I would encourage people who are borderline (like I was) to give it a try.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Son recommended this to the wife and I and we watched with some hesitation -- but ultimately laughed out loud more times than I can count. Really enjoyed it -- pretty funny.  Not a huge fan of all the dope humor, but the rest was pretty good.
030758836X|3.0|The book kept me reading (I like mysteries). However,  the ending was too depressing for me and close to the end I kept wishing it would just be over.  It's a bit too easy to guess this plot and without giving it away, I was disappointed by the ending.<br /><br />Go read the Language of Flowers instead.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I have always been a Stephen King fan and I like most of his books.  Every once in awhile he writes one that is just totally outstanding. This will always be one I will read & re-read like \\"the stand\\", \\"under the dome\\" & \\"insomnia\\"
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The stories characters Sky (Hope) and Holder go through some heart wrenching life experiences as individuals and together. They are strong young people of the heart, who live and love each other through some very trying times. This book is a must read! You will be hopeless to put it down until you've read the last page!<br />Looking forward to reading Collen Hoovers other books!
0871164566|5.0|If you are looking for a book full of creative ideas, then don't miss this one. It's packed full of simplified beautiful, yummy creations.
0345529057|5.0|The series provide an awesome visual painting, but lack the dept of the books. If you enjoy GOT you should definitely read A Song of Ice and Fire (just not at the same time or the plot can become confusing)
B0000UJDLM|5.0|It's a good story. It's entertaining. There's no moral depravity involved. The characters are unforgettable. This movie breeches the generation gap and should be considered a permanent part of everyone's movie collection. What more can be said?
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Very nice app.  Maybe needs to be a bit more obvious with its data for example as a kindle is designed as a reading tool, I would expect length of time left reading to be one of the measurements.
0802473156|4.0|Got this for my husband. Came quickly. Packed safetly. No issues. I would highly recommend. Great book for couples - married or not
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Read all the books of the Jack Reacher series.  I will continue to keep following the adventures of Jack Reacher.
034580404X|5.0|LOVED IT!!!!! I had all three books read in about a week. Can' wait for another steamy romance from E L James.
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|has come and gone.  We have been Brit TV fans for 30 years and counting.  We've primarily followed the various mystery series but have also enjoyed other offerings.  Downton Abbey has taken their TV productions to new heights in a way that Julian Fellows probably never thought possible, but at the same time a sense of detachment and disappointment has settled in after this season.  l hate to be spiteful but it's slowly evolving into an extremely well produced soap opera.  With the various characters coming and going you get the sense they're trying to keep the storyline alive but too many improbable events add up to hard-to-believe episodes.  This entire series has been the best of the best and I consider it to be the crowning achievement of Brit TV. Some of us, a lot of us, here in America have a serious appetite for this formal English society with all its maneuvering and back biting - regardless of our social emphasis on the everyman here.  It's a look back at a different culture, done in an amazingly detailed manner, in an incredibly gorgeous setting, with acting as only the British can bring to the screen.
B001BANK32|5.0|I watched the movie a few years ago and just recently decided to go ahead and purchase the book. I was not disappointed. I read it in two days and I feel like I have The Shining hangover. I would recommend this book to literally everyone!!!
B0092ZEIN4|3.0|The quality is okay, but the analog sticks feel very uncomfortable. I end up using mostly the digipad.<br />It is very small, so it does not feel very good in my hands, that might not be a problem for people with smaller hands, though.<br />I am missing the option to mount the device on top. I thought I don't care, but I do now that I am using the playpad. But when you buy it, you know it doesn't have one.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend a bigger game pad for mobile gaming that includes the option to attach your device.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great say to waste time. And my daughter loves having her very own horse. We play with the horse together and it also comes in handy when I need to get house work done. She plays. An  I get to clean .. very good app to have .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game you get to take of your own horse its like a real horse this is a game for horse people
B00881VLCE|3.0|TO EASY FORMY TASTE BUT OK JUST TO PASS TIME. PICTURES ARE INTERESTING,. I REALLY LIKED THE PUZZLES OF THE KITTENS.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Awesome season with a tantalizing ending! Keeps you wanting more. Can't wait until the next season!! It's a must have TV series.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Easy to use ane navigate documents.  Does a great job with all PDF documents.  i would reccomend this app for anyone.
B001OGTT0Q|5.0|Glad I listened to most of the other reviews that I read and bought this CD.  Previously I had only heard the songs on their greatest hits CD, but this first effort of theirs is outstanding and still sounds fresh....like I was listening to a new artist.
B000EGCITG|4.0|I love pink ! I'm a total music junkie and pink is one of my favorite artists. This album is awesome!! You'll like it too.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case is worth every penny, it comes in minimal packaging that is easy to open, no lethal plastic edges! Case has protected my phone in a couple of drops and it still looks great. I will buy this again when this one gets old.
B004JRVQX0|1.0|Wow.  All I wanted to do was use the library I purchased (EWQL Symphonic Orchestra Platinum) but it turns out that I also need this archaic, outdated, unfunny and overpriced joke.<br /><br />Can't even begin a 16-disc installation process until this slap in the face arrives.<br /><br />PACE, do you read these?  Shame on you.<br /><br />Won't be purchasing anything iLok related from now on.
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|I would have been happier with Ms. Clarkson and her record company, as with all artists and their record companies, if they would put the hits in order of how they appear on each album and the same length of time that shows on the album or the Radio Edit which ever listeners are most familiar with or prefer.  If they had included the song &#34;Dark Side&#34; on the regular Greatest Hits-Chapter One and or I had been able to find a single of the &#34;Dark Side&#34; for less than $10, I would have preferred it, then I wouldn't have had to purchase the &#34;Deluxe Edition.  Oh Well?
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I can't say enough about angry birds.  Such a fun game. When I finish the free app I will purchase another. !!
B00BESLHEA|4.0|This movie was really good the actions scenes are a bit over the top and the gore is spot on awesome! However it ultimately falls short not because of the story but because of the execution of the cinematography and some bad enacted scenes! The movies also, tends to not be grounded at moments but if you can over look that its a really fun story with great characters!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Purchased the camera app to Skype with my Grand Daughter, who lives out of state, so it is a great way to stay in touch.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|...that this calculator would adjust to both portrait and landscape views. It works great, is large and easy to read and super handy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty realistic. My daughters loves it. Only real problem is it doesn't want to load correctly half the time; other than that's its pretty fun.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|We are fans of the show and were pleased to find this season for reasonable price as compared to store prices.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Used this app for many years and haven't used any other app but this one. Found it to be very easy to use and would recommend it.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I love this book series!<br />Soo soo soo soo soo soos soo read it! Good details and lovey dovey story
B000NHPCS0|5.0|This movie was good till the very end. It was a bit long but it didn't drag, everything fit perfectly into the plot.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|This book was good it was very interesting at parts and also sad I would recommend it it was good
B005VPRG10|4.0|I like this set. It’s a good looking model and definitely one of the iconic ships of the Empire, however, for the first time since I’ve been purchasing Star Wars Lego sets, I feel like it wasn’t quite worth the price I paid for it. Compare it to it’s rebel counterpart the X-wing fighter. The Lego X-wing was similarly priced but had more pieces and a much more involved building process. The Tie Fighter however has little more than 400 pieces which doesn‘t seem worth over $50. Also Steps 2 and 3 of the build are the same wing sections (or solar panels or whatever they are called in the SW universe), so you end up having to repeat the same step twice, which is necessary, but repetitious. Also, it might just be me, but I think the finished ship looks too narrow compared to ones seen in the movies.<br /><br />On the plus side, you get a good selection of mini-figs--four in all. There’s no important big name characters here, but I actually like to see more generic Imperial officers and soldiers represented to build the troops, rather than just sticking another Darth Vader in the set. The Tie Fighter pilot looks especially cool.<br /><br />I don’t want to knock the set too much. It really does look good next to the X-wing and it‘s actually pretty big when finished. Also building the cockpit had a bit of a puzzle like quality to it in that you didn’t know how it was going to shape up and fit together until all the pieces are in place, which is something I like about Lego. I just can’t help but feel it could be a bit more moderately priced.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|so sad but so loving, best book.  have ever read.  i love augustus waters so much. hazel is the most reasonable person ever.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|UGH... drugs, depressing situations, another tragic story of redemption ... but it is not uplifting ....  wish I hadn't seen it
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|Very nice renditions of pop tunes. Especially if you cared for the film.<br />My daughters 11 and  12 loved it.  I enjoyed it but thought it could have used some laser weilding aliens.<br />Imo
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Not much else to say, use with Linux desktop and kindle fire, easy setup and works perfectly. Just perfect, wonderful, etc. Got my twenty words in?
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is fun and easy to use on the kindle.  Highly recommend the app for the kindle- fun, fun, fun.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I've played a few different mobile sudoku games and this one has the best interface I've ever used. Great levels, easy to use, looks great.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love it is fun and it makes your brain stretch you should get it is soo fun did you get it yet?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its so much fun. but if anybody can help me please do because i cant upgrade it. i do love it.
B000WCSBQ6|5.0|Arrived very quickly, very pleased with the service. Packed in a protective manner, and works very well -was hard to find this battery.
B0011Z0YJA|3.0|kind of a cross between black crows and Tom Petty - I was going to say like AC-DC but they don't do ballods
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I am so pleased with this game. The cube is easy to rotate and the size of blocks are easy to see.  Once you get used to the rotation of the cube, it is really great. You can also tweet your high score, although I was unable to do so.  I am playing on the kindle fire hd. Apparently the link between game and Twitter does not work on mine.  Anyway, love the game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys matching games.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addictive and fun game.  I would like to be able to change the music but this is a minor thing as I am normally playing other music in the background.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|I was having solo much fun, until I got to the attic.  I have a KINDLE and the second to last record album piece is under my tool bar!  What a bummer!!!!!!!!!  Please fix soon.  I believe I am stuck !!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this book - read it in 24 hours - couldn't put it down. I loved the ending - it keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through!
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|some times the next game does not automatically appear.  I have to go to the menu and then hit resume to get to the next game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I started reading the book, I didn't quite know what to expect (even though I had already seen the movie). But when I started reading, I couldn't stop. This is a great book for readers of any age!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I don't normally read this type of book but gave it a try since it was a free selection.  The story line was very predictable (and seen many times before) but that also made it very easy to put down and pick right back up when you wanted.  I didn't feel the cover picture matched the character description in the book at all.  If you are just looking for a fluff read to take your mind off the stresses of daily life, go for it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I know this series of books was written primarily for teen readers, but these books are great! They are so spellbinding, it is hard to put them down once you start reading. I highly recommend them for people of all ages.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book it kept me on the edge of my seat. Can't wait to see what happens in the next book
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Great game,needs more weapons. Best game out there for free. A absolute must for every gamer. More maps and skins
B008J1QFLU|5.0|Has to be the best conceived box set I have ever purchased. As far as I an concerned it was a bargain.
B000679QK2|5.0|Enjoying Phil and Peter as I travel through the hills and dales of life. Six more words required. oh two more words required.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Dragged a little and not as spontaneous as the other two.  Predictable except the ending where J is the son of someone killed by aliens.
0307352153|5.0|or anyone out there who considers him or herself and introvert - please get a copy of this book, because it will validate many things you have thought about yourself for a long time.<br /><br />Here is what so many introverts have been led to believe:<br /><br />Introversion -- along with its cousins sensitivity, seriousness, and shyness -- is now a second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology (Cain, Quiet, p.4)<br /><br />In contrast, claims cain, extroverts are viewed as smarter, more interesting, better looking and people who would make better friends.<br /><br />If nothing else, Cain presents a good case for why Introverts are needed... and cannot be ignored.  At least 1/3 of the population is an introvert (in America)... and maybe even more.  Instead of trying to get them to be more of an extrovert, Cain presents some good ideas for maximizing the strengths of an introvert: like focus, deep thinking, and listening.<br /><br />Even if you consider yourself an extrovert, you might uncover some valuable insight about the people around you who are mysteriously quiet from Cain's book.  It's a great read and full of great research.  Let me know what you think about her conclusions after you have a chance to go through it.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I dunno if I was just tired at the time but I just couldn't get into this movie that much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv it it is fun and awesome it is also colorful which I like it is like temple run but more colorful and different
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is the only mona app I have seen and it is probably the best one out there, I love this game.
B00913P6G0|5.0|This album really surprised me. I'm very picky about the rap/hip-hop music I like, listen to and especially buy, and this is worthy of my standards. At first listen I thought Kendrick Lamar was just making catchy tunes for people to listen to but listening again (to me at least) he's actually saying something (or at the very least a lot more than others), unlike many other rappers I hear today. This is a guy who is showing us some of himself and he means it. And not only do I appreciate the lyrics, but the music is really good, I mean, really good. My first thought when people called this album a classic was \\"There's no such thing as classics anymore\\" but after actually listening to it, I know exactly what people mean. This album is just a joy to listen to.<br /><br />Oh, and as a big time bonus, there is not a homophobic word to be heard on this album. I never have to worry about hearing something negative that I feel is aimed at myself or people like myself, all I have to do is sit back and enjoy the album.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is so addicting. You arrange your favorite things onto boards on your profile from any site by pinning them. And you can add other people's pins to your boards. Fashion. Recipes. Crafts. Art. Inspiration galore!! Not only can you see cool products you can go to the website where you can buy them. The pins link to the tutorials and recipes and artists. So much fun. And this app is just as easy as using the site on the computer. Fantabulous!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|So far 5 stars. This game is both challenging and engaging.  I really lime the way you can control the level of difficulty. its been years sense I first played this and had forgotten the best way to work towards a favorable outcome.  Once I was thouroughly re-aquainted with it, I was able to easily increase the difficulty and keep it entertaining.  Bravo -mobilityware! you designed this game very well!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a fun game, easy to play, lots of tile designs, nice sound, great picture. As a long-time mahjong player, I'm pleased.<br />Poo
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was awsome. I love all of Nicolas Sparks books, but this one just had a special something. It kept you guessing on what was going to happen and I was totally shocked with the end of the book..I have recommended it to many people, have also seen the movie
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Very quick delivery, and everything came in 1 piece.  One of the discs had come off of the plastic part, but everything was still fine.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I don't have children, but I enjoy a good quality cartoon and I find myself enjoying this movie.  Pixar's animation captures expressions, realistice movement so well it's hard to not be impressed with their work.
B000001ELR|5.0|1982 came at a tough time for Kiss. The departure of guitarist Ace Frehley and drummer Peter Criss left the band at a crossroads about where their music should go. But they werent stuck in this rut long. Enlisting the talents of drummer Eric Carr and a plethora of studio guitarists,including future member Vinnie Vincent,Kiss released their most rockin,fist pumping album to date. And what a joy it is to listen to. Gone are the poppy,art rock sounds of the previous 3 albums. Only hard rock and good times are allowed on this album,with 10 songs clocking in at 38 minutes. When its over,you'll wish it had been a double album.Granted,the following album Lick It Up would go on to greater fame and sold out concerts,but that could easily be attributed to the unmasking of the band members. Any die hard Kiss fan can tell you this is where to start if you're a first time listener and this album is proof that credit should go where credit is due
B008IYOEZM|4.0|Apparently, the DVD of this season has a mandatory advertisement that spoils the end of e season. For this reason, I would get it on amazon instant video (like I did) to avoid those spoilers.<br /><br />About the season, it is not my favorite of the seasons but I do like it nonetheless. A great show, the season lost me for a bit around episode 4 but brought me back in around episode 7. If you liked previous seasons, you should like this one as well.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Its very cute. They resemble j-ello tho. Once you finish it it gets boring. There's more levels to come. And its great on kindle fire. No problems (:
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love the Sons of Anarchy. I think it gives a view into people lives we really don't see everyday. Life can be chaotic for some and this show really portrays that chaos
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor Swift's album is fantastic! Glad I bought it and I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in her music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so fun my little cousins love it. There are no problems . I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|When I got this app I thought it was free and its not going to be good but I got a shock because I just love this game so much I can't wait for more games, just like this one but maybe longer. The story line is great and I just can't say enough about this app. Worth every cent you spend if you want to keep playing this app. Who ever made this app Please hurry and make more and the next apps that are made, please make longer I wouldn't mind paying a few dollars more for a game like this and longer so please HURRY and make more! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GAME.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Easy read that captures you from the first word. I love all the different relationships encountered and surreal feeling of solitude this book gives you. You are important.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter who is 8 loved this book.  Very fun and easy to read - the drawings kept her attention too.
1616550414|5.0|I have been waiting for this book for a while and it was worth the wait! I would have wanted the special edition but this is just as great!
034580404X|5.0|I enjoyed it, and it's nice to add it to my book collection, always keep the look out for new favorites
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Im really talented in this game i have a high score of 1,5**,*** with no hoverboard to help and it comes out something ne every 35 days
0307895475|5.0|If you do not wish to look at you tube and go through the nonsense of waiting for people to get done with their looting as they are telling you how to get through a tough spot or where to even find the quest, this is your time saver.  It tells me everything I wish to know, from ingredients in alchemy to what level souls go into soul gems.  This is a must have in my opinion...
B003405MF6|5.0|What a great CD.  You expect the guitar brilliance given it's Beck, and he does not disappoint.  I love that he's brought in guest artists and vocalists and taken a bit of a back seat on some of the tracks.  \\"Emotion\\" is a perfect title because this work impacts me emotionally.  Great work!  Wow!
0765325950|5.0|After having collected the entire series, (over so many years!) the ending is at hand.  My son and I used to exchange the latest editions every other year , when Robert Jordan would release them, for Christmas !  So sad that he died..so glad someone took up the challenge to finish his writings an put these last two together.  Brilliantly, I might add!!
B008D36INE|3.0|Rachel Weisz is lovely and does a good job in her role as a cheating wife in 1950 London, but the story is nothing new, rather predictable, and pointless.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Got it within a few days. It was a gift so I don't know how it played, however, I haven't heard any complaints :)
B004G600A4|5.0|The heroine is feisty, the love interest is dashing, and the villain is evil with depth. Love it.
B00125WAWS|2.0|I gave this two stars. One because I love Denzel, and one for the climax. This role did not tap into Denzel's awesome talent (see training day)  Plus, the kid character was screechy and annoying. It didn't reveal how to become a great debater except  for enunciation and knowing your facts. On the meat scale of spam-prime rib, this was a cafeteria hamburger.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I am a Sudoku fan and and this is a great app.  Tons of puzzles broke up by level of difficulty.  I like the pencil feature, the number feature.  This is a well designed and put together game.  I highly recommend it for an Sudoku lover out there.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|this movie was amazing with a hilarious helicopter scene. double thumbs up. would watch it again any day. Super Funny
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amazing!!!I like it a lot! It is very very very very very very very very very very very very fun!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The power up system is much improved. The gyms extend the playability, but come with such an ever increasing penalty that they are hard to abuse. It's a welcome change to be able to engage the power up of choice when needed. In the previous game it was advantageous to get the magnet and then the invincibility. But it was hard to come by that combination at random. Now you can effectively stack the power ups by getting one at random then engaging your reserve. The graphics are improved and the terrain varies much more significantly which is interesting.<br /><br />The downside is that this game is pretty laggy. The lag can be bad enough at times to make you miss a jump. This appears to be consistent across OS's too, whether or not your device is connected to the network. But it is still playable. Download it if you liked Temple Run, you'll like this one.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|WITH THE IRISH BACKGROUND, THE STORY LINE WAS REALLY GREAT.  ENJOYED IT AND KEPT YOU THINKING THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STORY.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|this game was boring right from the start i love hiden objects game and this game was too boring to even finish the game
1932100660|5.0|The Neurologist treating me for MS thought I would appreciate this book from a research standpoint, since I had been a research nurse. Wow, was she right. I am now a complete vegan, which I started immediately after reading this book. I never realized how much 'big food' has chosen mis-information and corporate and shareholder profits over our health on such a grand scale. I am so sorry I ever believed milk would give me strong bones. Instead as it turns out, my years of glugging down cows milk may have given me MS. So glad I breast fed my children.<br /><br />You can of course deny or reject everything it says, but at least then you would be giving 'informed consent' for all the risks you are taking by eating animal products.<br /><br />The part about high animal protein diets as a causative factor in osteoporosis, was quite compelling, and makes perfect sense. The American diet is not the healthy model we have been lead to believe. It is killing us. Campbell explains how.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|this app won't let you look through different parts what i'm trying to say is it makes you start reading from the very beginning
B00821PCJS|5.0|I thought this show was very well made.  The acting is good. I lost some sleep because some nights it was hard to stop watching.
B007SGM084|5.0|i REALLY enjoyed this this book when i started reading it i couldn't put it down i would like to find more books like this one this is a must read book
B000P0J09W|5.0|\\"The Goonies\\" has everything--drama and comedy--that will appeal to everyone--child and adult. The performances by Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, et al., are as professional as those by the adult actors, and that is much to director Donner's credit. In the extras on the dvd, the now-grown actors comfortably and with a good deal of comeraderie discuss their experiences making the film. This bond must have been there three decades ago for Donner to have elicited such performances from the kids. As you can tell, for me, the pleasure of \\"The Goonies\\" is watching a group of child actors enjoy themselves as they perform.<br /><br />The other 800+ reviews will tell you about the plot which I won't mention. Well, okay, that's not entirely true. There are individual scenes that will forever be with me: Chunk's confession, Data's entry into the film, the body in the freezer, etc. The parts are as good as the whole, and that's a rare achievement.<br /><br />Beside the commentary by the actors and Donner, the Cyndi Lauper videos are a hoot. Nice quality in a nice package.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Love the old school vibe on most songs; he still sounds like himself.  Good variety, too, of topics, tempos, and sounds. I'm digging it! &#34;If I Knew&#34; is my new obsession; short and so, so sweet.
B001I0T92Q|3.0|This is a great tool but, very flimsy. It started cracking in places and I almost had a major problem with it, but then I just reinforced it at the seems & crack with a thin layer of superglue & AMAZING!!! I have no problem ordering another... I have 2 16gb micro SD s in it and that is much better than the standard 4gb or 8gb I had for PSP 3000... !!!BUY TWO!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Over all good game...I haven't found a good hidden object game with a good storyline I even purchased the second part only bad thing is it freezes and won't let me play anymore

B000OT8GCQ|5.0|AMAZING! That's the only word i I can say!  I loved it...... I need to see the movie now!!! Loved it!
B005S9EKCW|1.0|I saw that movie not knowing really what it was. I went because I had so like the original show of 1985. Then I heard the singing and I couldn't but be but disapointed notwithstanding the cast's best efforts. I will never understand why they made that film. Whoever has seen the show whether live or on a video\DVD can't be satisfied with what that film offers. Each song is torture to the ear and the very worst of the sorry experience is listening to the rendition of Master of the house by Baron Cohen and Bonham Carter when you are in the unfortunate position of being able to compare the noise they produce with Alun Armstrung and Susan Jane Tanner perfect original London original performance. Javert is another character that suffers much with Russel Crowe's silly tentative at being the perfect baryton. Without a doubt, for a sceance offered by amateurs, one must give credit to all these people trying hard and not doing to bad after all. The question is: What were the makers of this fiasco wanted to prove?  That Russel Crowe can sign? I am sure he can cook a cake too. So what!

B000RLFJQ2|5.0|I have always wanted to purchase this movie for my uncle.  I am glad I purchased it for a reasonable price from Amazon.  This movie is a thriller with a great car chase.
B007QSNMS6|4.0|punchy points to get you thinking. enjoyed the conversation format and the relaxed tone. insightful and noteworthy. good for people who need to get some fresh insights.
B007REV4YI|1.0|James Bond is dead and has been replaced by a android. Daniel Craig is playing Daniel Craig. He is the same bland stoic emotionless actor he is in all his movies. Gone is the humor and wise cracking that we expect of James Bond replaced by a humorless boring actor. Sure the modern computer hardware at MI6 is fun but we need plots and acting. How much better would this movie have been with Pierce Brosnan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing and has great graphics and super fun, it is totaly the best free game there is, you must get this game and try it out for yourself.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I seen this movie in IMAX when it came out and it was worth every sent that I bought this Blu-Ray as soon as it hit the streets. I have been a Bond fan since I first seen Pierce Brosnan (don't really have time to look up the correct spelling of his name) play the iconic character and was convinced there was no better Bond until Daniel Craig stepped into the shoes and blew me away. I own both Casino Royal and Quantum of Solace and I would let those two burn in a house fire in order to save my copy of Skyfall.<br /><br />I have no real review skills so just take my word for it when I tell you that this is Bond at his absolute best....so far.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is my girlfriend's favorite book, so I thought I'd pick it up and read it. I did and I am very impressed. It is a really good book that nearly brought me to tears several times. I just feel like giving Charlie a hug.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this after my friend found it and after flipping through it I had to get one for myself. This ties all the Legend of Zelda games together so we have an acurate timeline of how the hero Link came to be and how he eventually ends up after all the games. Dark Horse really did a great job here.<br /><br />If you haven't finished all the games and hate spoliers as I do I would play any game you want to know before reading this especially Skyward Sword. I almost read to much.
B00633W614|5.0|As usual, Jeffrey Archer continues the Clifton/Barrington story in an engaging and gripping way.  The books are so well written and the plots absolutely fabulous  -  I can hardly wait for the third in the series.  Bravo Archer!!!!

B004X75RK4|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie, LOVE IT! They have such great chemistry, and this movie is delightful!  I hate to say it, but Oscar Nunez really makes the movie hilarious!<br /><br />I think the best value out there is Amazon and Amazon Prime for streaming instant videos and downloading movies - love it! Only thing is I cannot download the movies to my macbook pro :( will have to watch the movie from my iphone on the plane!
630587493X|5.0|good movie need to watch every minute and probably need to watch it more than one time to understand it.
B00A83075M|4.0|I can fix it!<br /><br />We've all been down this road before, where we don't seem to be appreciated or accepted for who we are. That's why Ralph decides to leave his game, the 1982 hit \\"Fix-It Felix Jr.\\", in which he is the bad guy, and hops into another, namely the dark and gritty \\"Hero's Duty\\". To win a medal and prove that there's more to him and he could be a good guy if he wanted to. Along the way he meets and befriends a cute little kid named Vanellope in the candy racer \\"Sugar Rush\\" who is having the same acceptance problem as him, as well as suffering from a slight glitch. While the story is very charming and entertaining, not to mention a near mirror image of that from \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\", I have to agree with other people who's reviews I've read online:<br /><br />1. Unfortunately this is not the movie that will prove that video games are an art form<br /><br />and<br /><br />2. It is a little over plotted. In fact in a way it's multi plotted.<br /><br />Those two faults aside though, this is a very sweet movie and it's nice to see some of our favorite video game characters alive and with emotions. And I gurantee that you'll instantly fall in love with Vanellope, even though she was a little annoying at first. That's just who she is and you know the rule, you don't mess with the program. Truly a nice, nostalgic digital roller coaster ride for the family. Two thumbs up!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|This got hyped up far more that it deserves.  There were moments where I enjoyed it, but overall it felt like a waste of my time, as the plot was lacklustre, I didn't like/agree with several of the major plot points or the execution of the plot, and the writing style was by no means flawless.<br /><br />The female lead, Sky, wasn't terribly convincing (and irritatingly, she seemed to claim that she &#34;wasn't one of THOSE types of girls&#34;, ie, 'sluts', whilst simultaneously defending her right sexual freedom and to hook up with whoever she wanted.  I feel like the author wanted to make a stand for women's sexual liberty, and that every girl DOES have the right to kiss whoever she wants and however many people she wants without being stuck with a bad label by society, but didn't have the conviction in the end, and had to include the postscript &#34;but I'm not really a slut like those other girls&#34; to appease the audience).  Furthermore, the female lead didn't have much to recommend her by herself, and it seemed the best part of her was portrayed as her relationship with Holder.  Now that just pisses me off, because it smacks of the concept that a woman isn't complete without a man to take care of her and coddle her through life.<br />Which is exactly what Holder does, whilst being inexplicably and infuriatingly moody.  Why does society constantly perpetuate the idea that women like and should always try to have relationships with brooding men?  It's a terrible idea!  It's ok for characters to have problems, and obviously these problems will have an emotional outlet, but I hate that male fictional characters become &#34;sexy&#34; as soon as they get grumpy.  And refusing to tell secrets, especially those that relate, or you suspect relate, to your partner?  That's not cool, that's a communication breakdown, and at the level of severity it occurs in Hopeless, I would call it a deal breaker.  Lack of communication about important things is NOT noble, it is NOT mysterious and sexy, and is not ok to be excused as &#34;protecting&#34; someone.  I really dislike that this book glorifies Holder's keeping of secrets.  Yes, obviously he felt he had reasons he couldn't tell Sky some things, but the end result is that he withheld pertinent information from her, and as a result she got hurt.<br /><br />**SPOILER**SPOILER**SPOILER**SPOILER**SPOILER**<br />Lastly, I feel like this is not a terribly positive book in terms of the message it gives about sexual abuse.  Whilst I understand that every victim has a different experience and a different recovery, NONE of the victims sought to bring their abuser to justice.  Each suffered greatly, some silently in shame in shame, some dealt with serious emotional and psychological problems as a result, and the abuser got off basically scot-free.  I don't feel like this was a book that gave the victims back their power after the abuser had stripped it away, to me, it felt more like a book worked towards a climax of the full realisation of the tragedy of the abuse, wallowing in the devastation for kicks and without serving a real purpose.  I feel like the sexual abuse aspect was gratuitously added in to raise the stakes, make the lows more tragic and the highs bittersweet.  I believe this would have been a better book if the sexual abuse aspect had been stripped from it, and it was simply a book about childhood kidnapping.  Either that, or the author treat the subject of abuse with the gravity and respect it demands.<br />**END OF SPOILER**
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|It was fantastic as was the previous two seasons.  I am waiting for the next season to take place.  PBS is a winner with this series.
B0015AARJI|5.0|It´s exactly what I need, It is perfect conditions, I´ve been playing with it for weeks<br />Thank you for everything<br />Best regards
B00933JF74|5.0|I bought this game on sale for $1.25, I think. It was well worth it. The graphics are wonderful, the music is enchanting, and the gameplay is really quite fun. You can get lost for hours playing it like I have countless times. There are a dozen or so scenarios and sandboxes as well.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|(PS3) Overall this is a great device.  It does exactly as it claims if you follow the instructions and take the time to adjust the settings in game as noted.  You also want to get a mouse that is at least 1600dpi and is compatible with the device.  Their website has great lists of what others have gotten to work and what has not worked.<br /><br />I know a few people that purchased this after seeing a friend of ours use it.  I took the time to follow instructions and set it up and it worked greast they didn't and it failed them.  Soon as we followed the instructions and set it up correctly it was perfect after that.  Only reason this did not get an overall 5 is the setup.  If you just want to plug the controller buttons into this and start playing like a PC don't buy it.  This is not the device for someone that does not to put in a little effort in the beginning.<br /><br />At first i tried to set this up with a Microsoft standard laser 1.0A mouse and it would not work.  Changed over to a Logitech USB optical and it worked fine.  I do see a big difference between a 800dpiand a 1600dpi mouse with this.  It's more noticeable than on the computer.  Keyboard almost anything worked with it that was wired as long as you don't try to put controls on special characters if the keyboard has them.  Game play has been great.  Targeting is a lot more accurate then with a controller.  This is ideal for FPS games and makes a great control upgrade.  Purchased it and wanted to iron it out for Defiance when it comes out.  Great choice overall.<br /><br />MAC users this is not compatible and it does not claim to be.  So you have to use a VM to set it up or just get a cheap netbook.
B005VTGB0S|3.0|I purchased mine at the same time as my 10.1 tablet (9 months ago). It looked great when it arrived. Functioned as shown. However, it says that it fits a 10.1&#34; tablet. It would not even fit around my tablet. I tried to stretch the elastic holders and still could not get it to fit. I am not saying that it was a bad product for smaller tablets (like an 8') but it just isn't made for a 10.1&#34; tablet.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|This novel is fairly short and an easy read.  You will enjoy it and it makes you think outside of the box. Read it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Kept you wanting more and more. The ending had me infuriated, but it still was a great book.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It's fundamentally a story about vulnerability, and desire.  It's also a meditation on the meaning of violence, and what exactly it means to be human. That one of the main characters happens to be a vampire that looks like a 12 year old girl, well.. That's the twist that makes it so crazy good.  This story plays no \\"twilightesque\\" games with the canonical attributes of vampirism, which is one of the reasons it's so riveting.  Vampires are like anti-superheros in that they have superhuman attributes, but what makes them interesting is their weaknesses. They move amongst humanity, appearing to be human, but in fact are an insatiable alien parasitical force that must skulk in actual darkness, fearing the light and human attention- for while they are strong, a vampire is also very vulnerable to exposure, which literally burns.<br /><br />So the title has several meanings: Eli, the girl vampire must of course according to the canonical vampire rule be invited into a home before she can enter.  But she is also searching for a human servant to invite into her world; to move for her in daylight, be her go between with human society, and to help gather her food.  Oscar, the boy she develops a relationship with, is also very vulnerable, a lonely and sensitive 12 year old boy who is ignored by adults and bullied at school.  They both are seeking someone to invite in, to address their respective longings and weaknesses.<br /><br />Oscar (and his predecessor, now an old man in this film, but once a young boy just like Oscar is in the film's 1970's Sweden) of course responds to Eli as if she were human.  And this is the deepest tragedy of the film.  The film plays with us, too, on that level - because we all respond emotionally to her as if she were a 12 year old girl, when she is in fact a monster playing our perception of her to her advantage. The question of how much \\"she\\" actually feels this, and regrets the loss of her humanity, is one of the most compelling questions here.  I think the movie manipulates us a bit on that score, or really lets Eli manipulate us, because when you step back and think about it, the only truly sane human response would be to put a stake through her heart.  That's what makes this story so transgressive - it taps our humanity and plays it, making us feel affection for a monster who does not deserve it.  Oscar, and Eli's older servant whom Oscar replaces, become complicit in her inhumanity, her monstrousness.  In so far as we sympathize with them, we become monstrous, too.<br /><br />My only criticism of the story's logic, which as I say is amazing, is that you have to accept that a vampire like Eli could exist for a couple centuries (apparently she's been a vampire for 200 years, a fact not mentioned in the movie, but in the book that inspired it) in a country the size of Sweden (and I suppose Norway and maybe Denmark) behaving essentially as a brutal - and rather obvious - serial killer, without attracting any undue attention, and getting caught and destroyed.  Not sure that's really credible, unless there's something about her that we do not know, that perhaps she also speaks Russian or German and has been hiding in places other than Scandinavia during that time.<br /><br />That quibble aside, I think this movie is one of the best of the last decade, and a true classic.  The American remake starring Chloe Moritz is almost as good, being an interesting refraction of the story.  Both worth your time, if you find the grotesque gripping at all., is one of the most compelling questions here.

B009UZBLSG|5.0|Simple to hook up, works perfectly.  I like that it has a charge port integrated into the adapter.  Only issue I have with it is that on an older HDMI compatible screen I use at work the sound is all garbled.  I'm not sure if it's a spec problem, and in all fairness it could be the jack on that screen being screwed up, but I haven't had a single problem with it otherwise.  Highly recommended.

B0015AARJI|1.0|Received this controller fast and in original casing .  Synced fine and worked fine.  Problem was after i was done using the pre charge it came with , and it was time to plug in.  It didn't charge. ruining the review. Instead of progressing battery bars on the menu.<br />It showed  a dead dash. No charging battery icon at all. It looked just like a dash for example.  (  -  )  .<br />Contacted sony support after 30 min of trying to resolve with resetting and different cords.  We came to the conclusion that it lied  in the  DC 5V  voltage stated on the back of the controller as i mentioned to the tech expert.  i told her that my other controller worked fine with the cords . The only difference was that it was your normal  3.7V  controller. So  she told me to contact this seller and ask for a refund or a replacement with a  new 3.7V instead of the 5V.  so thats what im doing . She also mentioned that she never really heard of this problem nor why they would make a controller that wont charge.  Ps3 works fine USB ports in fine condition. problem? the charging?  Does anyone else have a 5V  controller? if so also have this problem ?  replys greatly appreciated.

B004EPYZXK|1.0|Apollo 18(released Sept/11)stars Warren Christie as Captain Benjamin Anderson,Lloyd Owen as Commander Nathan Walker,Ryan Robbins as Lieutenant Colonel John Grey,Andrew Airlie as Mission Control and Michael Kopsa as Deputy Secretary of Defense.This film is yet,(*sigh*)ANOTHER prodigy in the long and ever growing line of Blair Witch Project imitators.Yep the old bait and switcheroo,with fuzzy and fast camera cuts,dark and spooky lighting,strange noises coming from....?,etc.,etc.It is all SO predictable.This latest incarnation takes us to the moon on a mission that never officially existed.The opening tells us that the movie is made up of footage(inference that it is &#34;real&#34;) that was uploaded to a certain web site a couple of years ago.<br />The film is shot using aging techniques quite common in use today,to make it look like 70s film stock.We follow three astronauts from pre flight with their families,to lift off,their journey and orbital path around the moon to two of the astronauts final descent and landing.This classified mission was put together so they could install  early warning instruments to detect Soviet missiles.Everything up until the moment they install the devices goes smoothly.Of course we know it won't last forever and on cue the creepy noise interference over their intercoms starts coming through.Then they find strange tracks in the lunar surface.They also find a Russian space module that has landed before their flight and the pilot is dead in a nearby crater.The officials back home give them so much info,but it is obvious they knew about the Russians and their mission.<br />They start to find things moved around in the LEM and their communications totally fail.They wake up one morning to find the U.S.flag is gone and their ROVER has been tipped over.One of them goes out to investigate and suddenly reports something in his helmet and falls.The other comes out and brings him in.He has limited memory recall on what just happened and they find a laceration on his rib cage.In fact there is something underneath the skin.They manage to pull it out and after a brief screeching noise,they look down and it is just a lunar rock.The astronaut's infection continues and as their LEM has now been disabled by something unknown,they head out to the Russian capsule.Along the way their ROVER gets turned over and the infected astronaut wanders off.The other looks and finds him but watches as he is pulled into a crater by unseen forces.He follows but watches as all the rocks start coming to life around him.He flees to the Russian module and is securely inside.He makes contact with the third astronaut who has been circling above the moon and they agree to rendezvous.Transmission from Earth has now recommenced and NASA is warning the third astronaut not to rendezvous with his compatriot.He ignores his superiors and awaits his buddy's return.However on the way up we see rocks aboard the Russian capsule start to rise and come to life and attack the astronaut.In distress he cannot control the  Russian capsule and the craft crashes into the other,most likely killing both.The film ends in a typed post script as we are told the official reasons for the death of the astronauts;all earth born accidents with no bodies recovered.It also mentions that some of the lunar material actually brought back from the moon,has been given away to foreign countries and alot of it has simply disappeared.<br />I must say for us who grew up and watched these lunar landings way back in the day,this re-creation looks pretty good in so far as the equipment used,both personal and vehicular.But the story is just way too predictable and quite pedestrian,at best.It is yet another case of taking half truths and inferences and making grand leaps of logic to convey a &#34;truthful&#34; message.This is the conspiracy theorists playground and right up their alley.Nice try guys,but no cigars for any of you.<br />Technically speaking,the film is in its w/s a/r of1:85:1,with some parts being full frame to simulate the camera technology of the 70s.Extras include multiple endings,several deleted and alternate scenes and commentary.<br />All in all a complete waste of 86 minutes of film time and yours.1:85:1,with some parts being full frame to simulate the camera technology of the 70s.Extras include multiple endings,several deleted and alternate scenes and commentary.<br />All in all a complete waste of 86 minutes of film time and yours.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|this was a wonderful film. phenomenal casting. well written screenplay. takes one back to those awkward between years of long ago.
0425252868|5.0|An awesome look at how one person in the right place can change the lives of many.  Franz Stigler used his faith and his own mind to make a decision to help another flyer in distress.<br /><br />It's doesn't come as a surprise that the incident was swept under the rug for over 50 years before it came to light.  I'm glad both crews made this known to the world that in times of war, people can still be civil and help one another.<br /><br />Such a fantastic read it was hard to put the book down.  It's a shame both men are gone now, I would have loved to met them in person to hear their story first hand.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was fantastic, I could not put it down. I cannot wait for the sequel. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves action, love and suspense.
B003Q7B78S|3.0|It didn't live up to the book. But I'm not sure anything could. Tilda Swinton's acting portrayed the characters very well.
386521584X|5.0|My husband loves good photographs. He is an avid traveler and takes a lot of interests in people he meets in his travels. This was a perfect gift for him. The photographs take you back to the roads of those days.<br /><br />The book arrived just as described and within the promised delivery date.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Plug and play. It's that easy, great battery saver, have had it for about 3 months and have had no issues, put in the pack and drop on the charger. There is also a noticeable difference on how much lighter the pack is compared to batteries. Nice product.
B005FSI1IK|5.0|I have enjoyed the whole series and have recommended to several family members and friends. If you enjoy family sagas this is a very enjoyable series.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Enjoyed viewing this but easier to purchase videos on  ITunes,  but would consider maybe doing it again for videos that are hard to fibd
B0000549B0|3.0|This is very misleading of Universal. The digital copy is neither hi definition nor restored. It is the old, muddy DVD version. When one purchases a high definition movie, the digital is supposed to be high definition as well. It's not!
B0096DZKZC|5.0|this is one of the best sonic and tails games ive ever played! Its a must-have! for those of you who complain about it not downloading its probably because you need more storage space
B008F5YDRI|4.0|The film is about a fisheries expert (McGregor) who is approached by a consultant (Blunt) and is asked to help a shiek bring the sport of fly-fishing to Yemen.  This is an unusual story but Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor make it enjoyable.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great book lots of emotions from both characters I don't really write reviews so I'll keep it short good read with realistic emotions that I felt myself
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I took a chance and purchased this movie based on the amazing cast: Judi Dench, Penelope Wilton, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup, Celia Imrie, Dev Patel, and many more. It is a charming comedy/drama; very well done.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book more than I love her other books, and that's saying a lot.  I'm so emotionally invested in her characters.  Thank you Colleen.  Thank you.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am a major fan of Downton Abbey, but while I love the series overall, I wasn't happy with the conclusion of season 3.
1583334386|5.0|Most books like this take one or two ideas and drag them out over several chapters.<br /><br />McGonigal has so much information here it is like drinking from a fire hose.  Now that I read it, I plan to go back and write up notes....it was that good.
B00AHJXRS6|5.0|Love these guys and this second release goes along great with their first masterpiece. If this is the future of progressive metal we are in very good hands. Great music and album all around.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Love this series! Great quality collection and wonderful price! Great stocking stuffer for my wife this Christmas! Can't beat it!
B00395ZYVS|5.0|This is a very engaging book. The characters, their relationships, and the places feel very real and vivid, and the story is so compelling that I could hardly make myself put it down.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|The soundtrack is A-MA-ZING and the version that Amazon.com sent to me was the best one, with Tarantino comments and all songs credits. The delivery was good (the only negative fact was that when the package arrived here to Rio's international airport it was Carnival and Federal Police didn't want to process the delivery in these days, so I had to wait a bit longer). I love the article and I'll continue to buy on Amazon.com. I really recommend the site.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie is great in 2D and it even looks phenomenon in 3D. Great Picture, great sound, great everything and no ghosting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I watched my son play this game and decided to give it a go myself, turns out, I love it! Very addictive! Fun for all ages!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Like the actors of this show. Needed to catch up on the season owning this I can catch up at my own time don't have to worry about returning it.
B004QX07G4|3.0|The book was fine.  Not something I would recommend to any of my friends.  Definitely not a &#34;have you read any good books lately&#34; kind of book.  It's forgettable.  But maybe if I was a super Ellen fan I would have enjoyed it more.
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|Love this movie. I have been trying to find this movie for couple of years now was very happy to find it.
0345529057|1.0|First things first, the actual story is great, fantastic in fact. But the kindle version is appalling, poor grammar and spelling. Worst of all I dont know what page I'm on, I'm 70% through the volumes but stuck on page 674. Its incredible that Amazon can sell this product for serious money but the actual product presentation is shocking!..It's S*** actually, shame on you!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is good cuz I can do mp3 downloads to any song I want and its free but the down side of it is that in the mid of a video it tells u that it's unable to play it. Good for mp3 downloads not videos
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Possibly one of the greatest books I have ever read, so touching. However I'm upset that it ended. Must read!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book, tells a wonderful story. You won't want to stop reading.<br />Thanks you to those who serve. And thanks to those who have fallen.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Swiftkey has the best prediction engine I have encountered.  This is a must have keyboard for me.  Great work. Keep the updates coming.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Fabulous performance for Denzel Washington. Watching him spiral out of control in such a realistic role was amazing. Watch his performance and you won't be disappointed.
0345803485|2.0|I was stunned to discover that this book has a female author.  The numerous sex scenes seem like a weird combination of porn written by a 16 year old boy and a very uncomfortable gynecological exam.  Lots of poking, pinching  and prodding and absolute cluelessness about female sexuality.  Ana is always ready and willing no matter when, where, in what manner or how often Grey informs her that he is going to have his way with her.  Her very first sexual experience was pain free perfection resulting in her climaxing magnificantly and she subsequently never fails to climax at least once, often twice, every time they go at it.  And as many reviewers have noted the writing is pure silliness with the same phrases repeated over and over.  But you have to admire someone who doesn't know much about writing or sex who has made a fortune with both.
1601251505|5.0|I love RPGs and this is no exception- it feels well-balanced and I play this all the time with my friends!
1475143389|5.0|Since beginning my fitness journey a short time ago I have read a lot of different books, articles & how-to guides. The author of this book not only tells it like it is, he tells you what other mediums are good and what are BS as well.<br /><br />I have completely adapted my workout & lifestyle to the books philosophy and because of this I am more focused in the gym than ever before. I have complete faith in the knowledge that I acquired by studying this book and give it my highest recommendation to anyone who is looking for guidance in their own fitness journey!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|WHITNEY HOUSTON WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT HER ANGELIC VOICE THAT HAS NOT ALREADY BEEN SAID, IT WAS EVERYTHING I EXPECTED FROM HER, EXCELLENCE, SOUL, SPIRIT FILLED, HER VOICE IS NEVER A DISAPPOINTMENT
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a nice game however once it becomes more detailed the screen on my phone and my finger tips become incompatible in size.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love this dictionary.  You can do a search of the word and find it with the touch of the screen.  The previous dictionary I had to look thru the words and I didn't use that one at all.  I have used the book form of Merriam-Webster and I love the book form.  Another review said you don't have to be online to use it and I hadn't paid attention to that.  This is a great, usable dictionary.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Every song on this CD is a winner.  Two Black Cadillacs is a huge bonus I didn't know I was getting.
B00AHXIC50|2.0|There are only a couple of songs that are worth the purchase.  Beyond &#34;young Girls&#34; & &#34;Locked Out of Heaven&#34; the rest of the album is average at best.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This was very economical and arrived in good time. It played half way thru & stopped. We wiped with different cleaners & tried to play in different brands of dvd players. We finallyy wiped it on a blanket & it plays great.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is an awesome movie...If you are a die hard Bond fan, this movie is for you. It was in excellent condition!
0307730697|3.0|The biography of Navy SEAL Adam Brown, Fearless is the story of a man without fear, who never stops, never hesitates. His story nearly gets derailed along the way, which becomes a major emphasis in this book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my biggest reaction to this book would be a minor rant about marketing. Fearless includes the rather lengthy subtitle \\"The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team Six Operator Adam Brown.\\" This, with the cover of the book and the general emphasis on Adam Brown as a Navy SEAL, suggests that the book is a military story.<br /><br />Author Eric Blehm, however, starts off his prologue by attempting to set this story apart as something different in its genre. Blehm suggests that this is not about a story about \\"Tom Clancy fiction\\"--the battle-scenes and behind-the-scenes thriller usually associated with military stories. Fearless is a good story, reasonably told, with plenty of military flavor, but don't expect much inside info on Navy SEALs or their operations.<br /><br />Rather, expect a different sort of behind-the-scenes story--one which tells Adam Brown's journey through love, addictions, restoration, failing, struggling, and determination.<br /><br />Fearless is actually the story of an Arkansas boy, who grew up in a great family, messed up big, found redemption, found an awesome girl, became an incredible husband and father, and incidentally was driven by his determination to join the Navy SEALS, and then to become an elite operator even within that elite group. To accomplish this, Adam Brown moves past injuries and weaknesses that most people would consider career-changers.<br /><br />I do have to add a small caveat--parts of the story include strong language and crudities, but nothing an adult or mature teen couldn't handle. Much of the rest carries a tone of hero-worship even when Blehm tackles a less-than-heroic story. I also found some frustration in the fact that the stories told here are all third-hand accounts from family and friends (hence a slightly lower rating), but you can probably get a better sense of the book by looking up its website and reading the prologue and first chapter available there.<br /><br />This might not be the best told story of the year, and I doubt it would have been written given a different ending to the story. But it is a pretty incredible story of courage, determination, and redemption.<br /><br />[My thanks to Waterbook Multnomah Publishing Group for providing me with a digital review copy of Fearless in exchange for my honest opinion of the book.]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a very good book. I would recommend it to anyone. It is better than the movie. It's worth your time.
0307279189|5.0|I stumbled upon this book when looking thru the Kindle books on running. Since my recuperation from surgery is over, I wanted to return to running. What a great piece of luck to discover this book. It was riveting...almost every page. You could not ask for a better running book! It was entertaining as well as informative. He has a great writing style.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun I play it al the time you shoudl definitely<br />get it and the best thing is thar its free
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Now I know that sounds overused. How many times have you had someone say, &#34;This series is the best I have ever seen!&#34;, honestly? It all comes down to personal preference obviously, but my answer has to be Game of Thrones. It's one of those shows that has production you expect to see in a movie. You just can't believe this is something that's on television. Much like Breaking Bad, Sherlock or Homeland.<br /><br />The pros:<br />everything<br /><br />The cons:<br />nothing<br /><br />I know that doesn't seem helpful, right? The show is just that phenomenal. If you are a fan of topnotch television, this is the series for you.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have fun playing this game on facebook and using my kindle gives me more access to enjoy playing at any time.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I am a total fan of comic book and fantasy movies that let you just lose yourself and enjoy them.  I never expect the greatest acting as long as it is a decent pace. I enjoyed this one.
1936891026|5.0|Bought this book for I heard it mentioned by Joe Rogan on his podcast. It is a great motivator and a must read for anyone who has failed to bring their inner artist or writer out.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is one of my favorite games for my Kindle Fire HD. It plays much easier than on my computer. I have recommended this one to others.
B005LAII8A|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone who likes action, without high sophistication.  I was an unusual story and certainly not boring.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This is way too fast of a game for me, and I have no idea what I am doing. I have friends who really like it though, so I imagine once I get it figured out, I will like it. If you are looking for a game that really moves, this one is for you!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This movie stays fairly close to the book. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job. Cannot wait for the next movie to come out.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am so happy to be able to use Pinterest on my Kindle Fire HD. Thank you for an app that makes it possible. I only regret that I cannot figure out how to Pin a page if there is no &#34;Pin&#34; on that page already.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Love this book, I actually read it twice, whereas I only read the others once. Great ending to the saga.
B00632HWOG|4.0|It was good to be able to use my yahoo mail on my Kindle Fire HD. This works much like my computer, but without all the ads.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Not much in the way of 3D, but it truly is a good movie to watch especially with kids! I could definitely see a difference from the original to the Blu-ray.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|When I got my Kindle Fire HD, I had no idea how to use it. I was happy to have FB available for free. Thanks for an easy to use app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Vivid and fun. Sort of like temple run. Keeps me alert. I love it play ot a lot almost everyday.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A normal solitaire type game, easy to play (maybe a bit too easy) and just what I expected. When you don't want to have to strain your brain, this is a good game to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game.and I find myself playing this game over and over again. My daughter also lives this game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I purchased season 2 of the Downton Abbey series as I didn't start watching the program until this season (3).  I also purchased season 1.  I wanted both previous years of this amazing series in order to understand the background.  I am so very glad that I did.  The ENTIRE series is adicting.  I cannot wait for each Sunday evening for the newest episode.  Right now I am in withdrawl as Season 4 won't be aired until January 2014!!!  Don't miss this marvelous series!!!!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I would give this game a 5 star review when they get rid of the forced friend aspect. These types of games are played by young children who do not need to interact with a social website. 5-6 year olds should not be accessing Facebook or other adult sites. Other than this minor issue, my child loves to play it.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game is soooo annoying. Every time you play it and you buy one or two cards the little balls at the top call out a number you don't have any of them until the end of the game!!!<br />THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games that i love.it is a cool games and i want it to be france
B000002VMD|5.0|The was an unspoken connection between the two of them and Whitney's music was absolutely awesome.  Had to buy and keep for my forever library.
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|I am not familiar with the gReader so I find it very unnecessary. If was better explained in its introduction I may find it useful.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|Enjoyed this movie to the fullest.  This is one that I decided that I wanted to keep and preserve in my movie arsenal.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I understand the need for ads to support free products, but it can sometimes be difficult to get around them.  Just display the ads and allow a single obvious click to close them.  If the ad is relevant, we'll read it in any case.
6305212112|5.0|One of the best books that I have read in a very long time.  Once I picked it up, I could not put it back down.  The book was far better than the movie.
1616550414|5.0|A big book with lots of great information about the Legend of Zelda franchise.  Includes concept art and more.  Well worth the money.
0345803493|5.0|It was another book that you just could not put down.  It was very interesting and wanted to try and complete in one sitting.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game because you get more like 15 minutes to play you get a longer trial then a lot of the other games i download.
0345803507|5.0|This was a great book.  You couldn't put it down once you began reading it.  Kept your interest for the entire time.
0345803485|5.0|This book is a good read.  The story line is very captivating and will keep you reading and wanting more.
0345803485|5.0|Another good book by the same author.  They all three were very very good reading.  You did not want to stop til the book was completed.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|crossed the second book to match trilogy its additive as matched. once i started to read crossed i wasn't able to put it down. i finished it in about two days i'm drawn to books where a society controls you every move the way the book was written i felt like i was in the book along with cassia . i would recomened this book to my friends
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game because it keeps th mind busy and for an old woman I need my mind busy to keep me on my toes
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Not nearly as adventure filled as I was hoping. These books continue to keep me up at night wanting more. It's easy to get caught up in the story, when present day Kvothe interrupts it is frustrating at first but then I find myself wanting more of that story as well. I also dearly wish to know more about Bast. Can't wait till book 3!
B005OLF6BI|5.0|My daughter loved this hard-to-find DVD.  This is perfect for the die hard Taylor Swift fan to add to their collection!
141659521X|4.0|Gotta love Vince Flynn and his awesome character Mitch Rapp. Book after book, they both deliver. The only thing I would comment on with The Last Man is there's no love interest. For me, a guys as tough as Mitch needs a woman on the brain to add balance. Either way, great book. Might also want to check out a new book called First Night of Summer. More domestic, but still high stakes.
1594203334|5.0|I thought I knew how I would parent because my parents did a pretty good job and I figured I would just follow suit. Well, my husband recommended that we read some parenting books before having kids just to get a different perspective. This book certainly gave me that. I had my eyes opened to a wonderful world of functionality that I have only had glimpses into previously. Babies sleep through the night, cooperate at the dinner table and in restaurants, eat vegetables, and don't have ridiculous meltdowns on a daily basis. And adults are adults rather than just parents; having kids doesn't mean the end of sophistication and fun. This book gives me hope and a sense of excitement for what lies ahead.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. JR did a wonderful job. Its hard to take a reality in a new direction while remaining true to the old one and not disappointing or alienating fans. The Legacy did a great job.
B0017I1FO4|4.0|I like the cd..but it came cracked in the mail...the entire case is cracked or shall I say sleeve...it was paperwrapped but still a cracked cover..otherwise like the cd..second chance my fav....
B005CFWH4A|5.0|The colors are extremely vibrant - just what I wanted. Lightweight and oh so very comfortable to wear and walk in.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|this is a great game, either with cards or electronically....My whole family loves this application and we all have our own profiles.
1449410243|5.0|Birthday present for my brother, which I had to read before giving him in the interest of quality control. Great book. When he opened the package, he started laughing and didn't stop.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|My boyfriend and I watched this together. We have very different taste in movies and we both enjoyed this movie. I really enjoyed getting to know K's character a little better. Very funny movies as well.
0780619587|5.0|Having read an article about the gentleman,<br />I cried when the movie arrived.  I have watched it<br />half dozen times.  It is WONDERFUL!!<br />I still can't believe I was so &#34;lucky&#34; to have had the opportunity<br />to purchase it. Could not find it any where I looked and asked about<br />it.  Thhis is one movie that will stay in my collection for<br />popcorn on a rainy day.  Thank you so much. I will forever be in<br />your debt for the joy this story has brought to me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game; it is just too overwhelmingly good! It's an addiction that I can't control! I'm hooked to no end!!!
B009X01ELC|5.0|i love this case, i accidently drop kindle and the case kept it from being destroyed. would buy it agaom
B008TSVZHM|5.0|Came across this gem while browsing and decided to try it out.  Great way to carry around all our microSD cards!  Cards &#34;click&#34; into place, and I have no worries that they're going to fall out.  A spot on the back for writing card contents.  It's a little bulky for my wallet (IMO), but would probably fit into a case's credit card holder without problem.<br />Will definitely buy more when needed!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a great exiting book. One time though I got a little lost and it does get violent I really liked this action packed book.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I haven't even tried this game and I won't; due to their unavoidable ads constantly popping up on the other games I play. No thanks.
B00390BE7G|4.0|reccomended to the reader who want to know what's behind the meat in &#34;our&#34; plate.<br />A detailed account written from the point of view of an animals' lover
0553582445|5.0|This book was on my son's wish list so I bought it for him for Christmas.  I have not checked with him to see how he enjoyed it, but if he did, I'll be buying the other books in this series.
B005HED08I|5.0|Nothing is ever better than the original. Stand aside bald Enterprise Captain....lol. Only Kirk is the Captain and he has the Helm!
B002ZG980U|5.0|This was a gift for one of my sons and he enjoyed it so much that he also bought it as a gift for his brother's birthday!<br />Now I need to purchase it!  They said I would like it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Got me hooked with the first, really explores Lisbeth as a person, lots of back story and insight into what makes her tick. Really ramps you up for the 3rd and unfortunatly final book. I found myself almost sad, as I was reading knowing there was only so much left in the book.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband and we enjoyed watching it together.  It was encouraging to find a coach who taught values to his team.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just don't like how it makes me restart and resets me. but other then that I like playing it a lot and I play it every day
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|i really enjoyed reading this! little twists and turns i was not expecting. i would reccommend this novel for sure! well written.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is an undiscovered classic (Unless you are from South Africa where everyone owns it). He is someone that just got lost in the mass of early 70's music but should not have been.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|even though we all know exactly where each of these books are heading their still an easy enjoyable read start to finish.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Super fun game it has you going from New York to Rio them to Rome as you are chased by a police officer. It is great gun and free!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter bought this app for her kindle fire. It's a cute and wholesome game that is easy to play. Came in handy during the flu season!!!
1402786360|5.0|Found some great recipes in here. Made some for work and family, they all loved it. the recipes are easy to follow and i love pictures because i have to see what the end result will look like..
B00942S4OY|3.0|While I hate it; my daughters love it.  Therefore, it attains the highly coveted ok rating and will likely drive any adult nuts.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is a deep reading! So stop and reflect often. I never realized all the negative or unhealthy agreements we allow to rule our live! I really can say after this reading I'm ready to take the next step & create my personal heaven on earth! I recommend this book to anyone who is going through a tough time or anyone looking to find meaning/purpose in life!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's Facebook, keeping up with your friend's pictures and post. It does have a little delay but it good enough.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|It's one of the best sudoku games. You can see the timer, you can play different variants, you can choose between different levels of difficulty. If you find a mistake, you can easily delete it and don't have to start again. Also, if you are struggling and can't go on, you can use hint and it helps you. You can even create your own game and there are plenty of things to change. For example you can change the color, font and a lot of things just the way you like it. It's a good app to spend some time and I think it's impossible to get tired of it. It has so many different opportunities. I highly recommend it and I think I would even pay for it. It's really good!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Great way to keep up with people.Good way to fine out with going on in the world. Funny,cool or just down right dirty information you sometimes don't want to know about your friend's or celebrity.
0307949486|5.0|this book go's right along with the movie give vastly more information on the cariters and is great for a midnight read.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|Music video with great pictures.Choose from different types of music. Since I had this app I have been able to view my music with a internet miss up.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I &lt;3 this app because its soooooooooo fun and addicting!! I love the different settings and characters and boards and accessories so u can customize ur game to ur own unique style!!! I loved this and I promise u will to!!! but most importantly: remember: IMACHICKA!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Who doesn't like pinterest. Getting different kinds of ideas of home projects,food, birthdays party ect. It's Google with pictures. It has something for everyone.
B003HKN51Q|5.0|Man if this is an indicator, I really hope technology continues to improve. To hear and see this blu ray!!!!!!!!!!
0060229357|5.0|When I ordered this book, I didn't know what to expect, but it was certainly left to the imagination and alot of fun.  My grandkids are 4 and 6 and enjoyed it and especially to see what Harold was going to do with the Purple Crayon next.  It gave them the concept that they can draw anything.  Great job.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was a good book a little slow moving but really good book.  Would recommend it for sure. Yep
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I was a little behind on picking up the Hunger Games trilogy, but I'm glad I did. The book takes place in a dystopian feature post-USA and is chock full of violence, oppression, and general dismay. In the midst of all that grim, I fell in love with the heroine, Katniss Everdeen. What an accurate depiction of a teenage girl so busy fighting for survival that she seems to barely know herself or understand how to interact with the world. She has her strong suits and she does her best to stick to them and its endearing. The books definitely sweep you up and, thankfully, they are a fast easy read. While many younger children with advanced reading capability can pick up these books, I'd suggest waiting until 12 or so due to the violent and, in the final installment, sexual nature of the books.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I loved this movie!  Matt Damon is fabulous!  And I love that it is full of excitement and romance and everything, but still clean!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I'm a huge Ferriss fan and enjoy all of his work and ideas, even if they aren't 100% applicable to me. The 4HB diet in particular has been helpful and life-changing. A definite must-read.
0307272702|5.0|A must read for everyone (overweight or not)!  This book makes absolutely perfect sense. Not full of &#34;doctor talk&#34; that you can't understand.  Just straightforward everyday advice.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Awesome!!! All the movies and bonus CD is great! If you are a Star Wars fan, get it. There was nothing I didn't like.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a fun game. It takes some time to get enough points to unlock games but it is still fun.
1932100660|4.0|I gave The China Study and Forks Over Knives The Cookbook to a friend to start her new lifestyle.  She was pleased.
0345803493|5.0|I havent been this interested in a romance novel in a long time, I could not put it down. Of course its part of the trilogy, good read though.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I chose 5 stars this game not only teaches you the exact notes but it is highly challenging as well!
B001UV4XUG|5.0|This is one of my favorite chick flick movies. I like that its not really a love story its speaks to me personally because its a story of a guy that likes a girl who likes someone else.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is an attention grabber, it keeps you on your toes, and keeps you coming back for more loved it!
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|i really enjoyed the relationship between the two characters, however i didnt like the ending as much as i thought i would
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The main purpose of this game is to run away from a fat guy in a bunny suit (pedophile), police uniform, zookeeper uniform, etc. Anyhow, it's a nice game. The only part that annoys the crap out of me is that I have to update it monthly to keep up with all the new characters, hoverboards, and settings. Overall though, awesome game.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|this movie is really exciting throughout the whole movie and the special effects are tremendous yet the storyline is hard to understand to get and a little hard to get in at the beginning of the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun filled great game easily addicting especially when competing with other friends with Facebook. Even though u don't have to connect I still love it and prob will never stop.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|this movie has so much action and the characters are great, the length of the movie is so long which is the way i like it without non stop action.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|It's a pretty good game but it eventually gets old after a while the noises can get pretty annoying but other than that it's awesome
B008YI99IE|5.0|this movie is the best out of all of the jurassic parks and there are adventurous and comical reliefs out of every corner.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|The perfect game for a air hockey game it's good the two . Player part was cool and it has a tournament mode
B004NEY9EW|4.0|the movie has a great storyline and Daniel Craig has smooth moves throughout the movie except that the music is a little provocative in the intro.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a great app. it is very easy to set up and use. you can load several locations to keep up with weather in different places. highly reccomended.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|this movie is literally so cool and tom cruise actually did really good throughout this movie and the special effects are amazing.
B008BWFP2W|4.0|\\"Elles\\" (2011 release from France; 96 min.) brings two parallel stories. In the first one, we meet Anne (played by Juliette Binoche), a reporter for the renowed French fashion and lifestyle magazine \\"Elle\\". Anne is writing an article on escort services provided by young women at university in Paris. The article focues on two such women: there is the timid Charlotte (played by Anais Demoustier), and there is also the more brash Alicja (played by Joanna Kulig), a Polish student who has emigrated to Paris for her studies. The second story line centers around Anne's family: her husband and her two sons. Everyone in the family seems to be in their own little world and Anne feels frustrated and boxed in. The movie plays out over the course of a single day (but with flashbacks) as Anne is trying to finish her article for Elle, and is also preparing for a dinner she and her husband are hosting that evening for his boss.<br /><br />Several comments: I realize that the movie is titled \\"Elles\\" as a wordplay on both the magazine and the two young women we get to know (\\"Elles\\" is the French female plural for \\"they\\"), but this is doing a disservice to the movie. Why? Because as it turns out the movie pays more attention to, and is far more effective as an analysis of, Anne's crumbling marriage than it does to the economic and emotional circumstances of the two young women. The last third of the movie barely touches on the fate of the young women, and hence my suggested retitling of the movie. That said, the acting performances of the three leading ladies are all noteworthy.<br /><br />The movie is a co-production between a number of various French and Polish resources. In fact I don't recall having seen so many different \\"supporting\\" and \\"participating\\" groups in a single movie (maybe as many as 15!). The movie is directed by an up-and-coming Polish director, Malgorzata Szumowska, and I look forward to seeming what she will do next. Bottom line: this movie is MUCH better than some of the negative reviews here might lead you to believe. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you will not be disappointed with \\"Elles\\".e of the negative reviews here might lead you to believe. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you will not be disappointed with \\"Elles\\".
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|this movie is probably the best of all the James Bond and all of the 007s with Daniel Craig with his smooth moves, this movie has its great length with awesome action.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I looked forwar the opportunity to obtain this box. Due to Amazon I've got it, at last. I didn't open it yet. I'm awating special case for it. Cool.
B0042C1BP0|5.0|this movie is my favorite out of all the James bond movies, with excitement and action out of every corner and watching the smooth ways Daniel Craig talks to everybody is just so awesome.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I'm picky about my Sudoku so I usually wind up playing it with paper and pencil so that I can do it my way, however this app gets it all right.<br /><br />I love that I can play it in either landscape or portrait, I hate games that force me to play in portrait.  With two keypads on the screen, one for entering in the numbers and one for doing small 'penciled' in 'maybes', I can easily switch between modes without having to press extra buttons. This app lets you chose between hitting the number first or the cell first when entering numbers. It also gives you the ability to change fonts, size and colors.  I've never seen an app that was more customizable. if you want you can also lock the cells so that once you enter a number in a cell you can't accidentally enter a different number unless you clear the cell first.<br /><br />If you are new to Sudoku there are plenty hints you can enable and there is an easy to hit check puzzle feature to make sure you don't have any conflicting values. If you turn off the assistance function then you can't be tempted by the hints or check puzzle feature.  Don't worry, the help feature will walk you through everything.<br /><br />With over 15,000 puzzles and multiple variants such as jigsaw and color Sudoku I won't be looking for new Sudoku apps anytime soon.  The puzzles range from very easy to nightmare, a/k/a, I have a serious headache now. I have barely made a dent in the puzzles so far, but I'm hooked.<br /><br />Well worth the price even if I never get around to using the other features such as importing or generating more puzzles.<br /><br />(Toshiba Thrive and Fire (2nd gen))
B008YI91HS|5.0|the movie is way to exciting to see what happens to the next scene to the next scene and the characters are hilarious and great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app I can play it for hours I hope the maker comes out with new apps you should down load this app
B0013ND30M|5.0|great remastered edition and is great for little kids or maybe even older teenage and even college girls that still miss their childhood.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it!! Great to teach my son how to care for a horse so he can help when we buy one of our own
B0090EIILU|5.0|this movie is a great late night comical entertainment to enjoy with a bunch of friends and this movie has hilarious comments about other countries and this movie was just to funny.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is one of the best games I have and its free go buy it now it is stile the a good game
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|this movie has its peak of making it so funny it hurts in your stomach but beware that you must be able to take the jokes for that they are very insulting yet really funny but overall this movie is way too hilarious.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Just love this Alien Anthology movies. Just did not have the complete set on Blu-ray. The deal was real good.
B008YI9CWW|5.0|this movie is so adventurous and comical, this movie has action by every turn and the directing is literally great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|OMG what a book am so amazed I consumed it in two days. Up down I even cured. I hope the next one she picks peers he's amazing guy.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|this movie is so cool and action full-filled, comical reliefs throughout the whole movies even through the darkest moments and has the coolest special effects.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I wanted a clock more like a regular one this didn't show current time only alarm time which cofused me had to still use a regular clock to tell current time didn't even try to use it because didn't like when I set it up.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|this movie is so cool and adventurous with witty actor robert downy jr. this movie excels in its rising action all the way towards the climax.
B0080GUX2Q|4.0|I normally hate self-help books. This was recommended to me because of this; also the fact that I agree with the idea that being positive all the time is dangerous & not a panacea to all life's problems. I lived in California for 4 years & saw this first hand. I worked in Silicon Valley. We were all encouraged to be more positive. This lead, in some cases, to great success. However, half the time people chose paths that were completely wrong for them. They chose this because they assumed they could be anything they wanted, regardless of ability or talent!<br />The stories (e.g. George Bush) in this book are great. They only problem is that it got a bit repetitive in chapter 4. You could lose readers here. After 10 pages or so it got going again. A great read!
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|I bought this app today because I like Big Fish games. It's a fun concept but I'm breezing through the game. I hope it gets tougher or they add more difficult levels.<br /><br />The game is fun and relaxing.
B0011ETNXE|2.0|2 stars, not because the Artist or music is bad, but because I bought this on Vinyl record hoping to get the best but the mastering is atrocious.<br />It is predominantly the Audiophile market that buys Vinyl records, so why do the modern day engineers re master and butcher great music? Why don't they just leave it the FK alone ! It's a tragedy what these barbarians are doing to classic music. Sadly, a largely uncompressed quality record destroyed by crap engineering.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|As someone living with bipolar disorder with family members that also suffer from mental disorders such as the same and obsessive compulsive disorder, it was very hard for me to watch this movie. I just saw it for a second time and it wasn't any easier.<br /><br />I don't know how to describe exactly how this movie makes me feel. It's very emotional and powerful for me. It doesn't make me sad. It doesn't make me happy. But at the end of the movie I'm ready to walk out with a smile on my face. The undying optimism is something that, in a depressive phase, we don't have. So it was nice to have bipolar disorder treated less like depression and more of what it really is: a lot of misery with a lot of hope.<br /><br />I fervently argue that this movie deserved every Oscar nomination that it got. Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job, and Jennifer Lawrence... I completely forgot she was in the Hunger Games while watching this. She was a real woman in this movie and showed a genuine break-out performance. De Niro and Weaver are a great supporting team and make the dysfunctional family dynamic come to life.<br /><br />I see tons of complaints that the ending assumes that, \\"Oh, they fell in love, they'll be okay.\\" I'd like to let you know that that's simply not the case. It's the end of a delusion for Pat. It's the end of an era of misery for Tiffany. You have to assume that of course, their illnesses will cause struggle as time goes on, but right now they're content. And when living with a mental illness, that's what you want. Stability and content.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this, please do yourself a favor and watch it. It's very real.
1119963192|5.0|This book is the EXACT kind of book that I was looking for. Although it does have drills & training exercises, the primary focus is on TECHNIQUE.  I wanted a book that I could learn about the correct way to swim freestyle and then practice what I learned.  This book has exactly that.  It goes through each part of the stroke and tells you the proper way to do it with tips and even alternate ways of doing something.  There is a section on shoulder injuries and how to prevent, there is a section on open water swimming if you are interested.  Also, the 2 authors share their experience on different topics so you can see how what they are telling you relates to real life.  But it's an easy and fun read and it significantly improved my swimming in a few sessions of practicing.  I always go back to it as reference as well.  This is a great book and I highly recommend it if you are looking for learning more about proper technique.  Now if I can only find a book like this on cycling and running...if anyone has any recommendations, please let me know!
B0090SI460|5.0|Many movies originally not made for 3D are not redone with much 3D pizazz, but Monsters, Inc 3D is one of the exceptions.  Throughout the movie there is so much \\"depth\\" to the scenes, it was exciting for the whole family to watch again.  Definitely worth the extra few bucks to get the movie in 3D for those that have a 3D setup.  the extra blu ray copy, DVD copy, and digital copy are nice to have around for traveling in the car or watching the movie solo on the tablet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the app but I can't update to the newest version. Mine is still on Rio. I want Rome!
B0031QVW2U|5.0|This strap is over-priced, that should be obvious. But if you're a heavy user of the BlackRapid single strap systems this is an absolute must to maintain your strap while moving around. There are probably other ways, but given how often I use my RS-5 with the BRAD I think I've more than made up the cost and I consider a cheap investment in the long term. I was kicking myself for a few weeks after getting this realizing that all of the hassles I've had with my strap moving around could have been alleviated with this little piece of nylon.<br /><br />Also realize putting the strap on, including the BRAD, can be a bit cumbersome, but if you're in a rush you can always wait until you're in a position to do so and it won't get in the way in the meantime.
B005GG7WN6|4.0|It looks new and shows well.  Happy enough and even pleased to give it as a gift to a history buff.
0060832819|3.0|The story is good, but I found it a bit clumsy, not flowing well. I just finished a good new novel:[...] It reminds me of Coehlo's work but less self involved and better written.
B001QJUX24|5.0|The best western ever filmed say many critics. I agree, John Ford at his peak. John Wayne never better. The cinematography is studied in film schools everywhere. I never tire of re-watching this amazing film. More to find frame by frame, DVD is wonderful for the quality of the stop action when you want to treasure certain moments.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I loved it, it was very descriptive in the passionate scenes. Can't wait to see who gets cast as these characters.
B0054JELTI|5.0|This is my fave Shrek ever compared to the other sequels. The originality and the story is solid. The rest of the sequels seemed like they're just trying to milk the franchise! Reason why I said \\"Freakish\\" its because the Blu ray version of Shrek is too clear that you can clearly see Shreks skin texture! It looks kinda greasy! Oh well thats Hi-Def for yall!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|i watched some in hd on my tv and some in regular on my laptop. my friend from the UK was visiting and wanted to see season 5 so we had a blast watching.
B00000IOSU|3.0|The set list covers her best music, but she never really breaks out of the safe zone. It's too soft, even for Sarah.
B00007GZR5|5.0|I saw this movie years ago and have been trying to locate a copy since then. Duh lol, i decided to try Amazon books and Voila. So as you now know I have it in my extensive movie collection and will love it forever. Thank you sending it and it arrived in original condition.
B00007KWHN|4.0|Back in the day, Yes was coming into its own and hadn't necessarily patented its sound. This is the album that shows their musicianship without that label. Amazing musicians.
B000XTE9TG|5.0|Everyone knows Songs from a Room and Songs of Love and Hate, but this is and amazing album. This album is a collaboration with the great Phil Spector and you can hear the influence throughout, with the grandiose production and female backup singers.
0345525558|4.0|The author shows how the past never truly leaves us and how one must get over past hurts to ever truly find happiness in the present.  The elegant writing style in the book echos the beautiful language of flowers that the reader is introduced throughout the story.  Makes a girl wonder why her boyfriend isn't sending her message-laden bouquets.  Why did the Victorians have all the fun?<br /><br />Victoria as a central character will break the readers heart.  A lifetime in the system has convinced her that she isn't worthy of being loved and you as the reader can only watch as she turns away from happiness again and again.  Sometimes its hard to read, as you can't help but want to reach out and shake Victoria to make her stop the cycle of hurt.  Still, the pain makes the growth of the character from the beginning to the end that much more appreciated.<br /><br />I would recommend the book for sure.  Some stories are just inspirational and manage to pick you up even when the tale is a sad one.  This is one such story.
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and I would Highly Recommend it! I read the book in school and this movie did a Wonderful job keeping with the story line of the book! This movie is a classic and I was so happy to find it in Blu Ray to add to my DVD copy! It is a very sad movie at times but there are happy times too! The movie is High Quality and it helps so to bring the book to life!
B009LDXQGW|5.0|THAT IS ALL. WELL ALMOST ALL.... I HAVE TO WRITE 10 MORE WORDS. SO HERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. GO! I AM SO IN LOVE WITH YOU ABEL TESFAYE... XO
B003F3FJQO|5.0|not very much can truly take a person to a parallel world in such a strange way. I am left guessing every step of the way about what would happen next. It's action packed and your constantly on the edge of your seat
034580404X|5.0|Expected to have my hair stand on end, but found the books to be incredibly sensitive to the subject and fascinating.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a very exciting awesome game.Temple Run 2 had better back down because this game is the greatest game in history.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Every CD of his I have purchased has been wonderful. Love his voice and choice of songs he  chooses to record
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun!!!!!!!! This game lets u explore Rome but just n a fun way. I hope u guys enjoy this game a lpt
B004H1V5RU|5.0|it is a nicely challenging game for an above average kid that really wants to do something fun. it is a good way to keep hands and eyes busy too
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Hey this game is very blurry and boring don't see how y'all can stand it that is just my opinion that all you can say it's all perfect but it's not so sorry though
B003SHYVO8|3.0|ordered on my kindle, it was ok movie. Music and dancing always entertaining but story pretty weak. Occupied an afternoon I was recovering from the flu
B0013TTLDE|4.0|This book started out slow with a weird story, but had plenty of twists to the plot so that I ended up dying to find out the whole story!
B0044RUSZM|4.0|Plug in an external keyboard, mouse, and second monitor, prop up the laptop and I'm good to go! It seems a little wobbly, but I don't think it will fall.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I read this book to my children....now they're grown and my grandchildren are hearing this.  I think it's really ME that loves this, but whatever!  They like book reading!
B009G41CG2|4.0|Typical mahjong. It's easy to see and the game set ups are different. Pretty good for a free  game/ app.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Kind of schmaltzy, but enjoyed the growing love story.  The angst of this difficult life scenario was done well.  Worthy of a good read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Easy game and very relaxing to play. Good for animal lovers. Children would like this game. It has nice graphics
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is amazing. One of those books you can't put down. Amazing plot and a amazing description. I would recommend this book to all readers
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The games are engaging and the music is soothing. I enjoy playing before bedtime it helps clear my head and relax me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the first of Flynn's books I have read. If you like twists and surprises, this book is for you. Flynn takes us into the world of Amy, a beautiful, young wife who suddenly disappears, and her husband Nick, an enigma with skeletons in his closet. It's not your usual mystery; it's like an onion. As you peel layers of the story, more and more happens. Just when you think it can't get any freakier, Flynn surprises you again. It's sick, twisted, and brilliant. Great read!
B008N9AAQ4|1.0|The service was excellent and the Blu Ray was brand new, however it would not play in our blu ray player because of a clash of regions!? You know it is being sent to Australia, and if the movie only plays in the USA it should not be allowed to be purchased in Australia. Now we spent money on something we have absolutly no use for! Not happy
0321344758|4.0|I am glad I bought this book even though it is expensive and even though I had to pay international shipping to get it.<br />I am designing a site using WikiMedia and I got some beneficial information from Steve Krug.<br />Don't cram too much info on your site.<br />Don't make the user think too much.<br />Keep it simple.<br /><br />Consider your website visitors to be similar to readers of billboards.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very interesting movie. Keeps you at the edge of your seat all the time. The fact that it is a true story makes it even better.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Add my review to the other 3700+.  I loved it, really and I think it would make a fantastic movie.  Hope somebody has snatched up the film rights!  A++
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|By now we are all 'Seasoned' and this one is so full of surprises!!!  I'm only hoping there is another season because there is no way in 'Hay' it's over.
0307346617|5.0|Great book, lightly used as the description said, but for one penny you can't complain!<br />It's a very quick read.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|The library has it, true, but like I said, I love it enough to want to own it. One of those awesome sing-along musicals.<br />Julie Taymor is an awesome director! Great cast (well, except bono, who I no longer admire or respect... but that's beside the point).
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I bought this for my new Iphone 4s.. I don't need anything fancy. This case does the trick and is still in like new condition after almost a year of use.. great product..
B001TODCII|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever watched! I have watched it several times and would highly recommend it !
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I actually was not expecting the ending at all... I think it's a great read and I recommend it to anyone!
0793927501|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have ever watched!  I have watched it many times and would highly recommend it!
B002SRQ214|5.0|I just bought this off Amazon for $85. You can find good deals on it, and it's the best for your money right now in terms of gaming CPUs, according to Tom's Hardware.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|This sleeve fits the Kindle perfectly, and keeps it from getting damaged or scratched up.  Good thing to have.  Yep.
030758836X|1.0|Badly and childishly written.  Unbelievable characters. Stupid plot. A suspense novel that is not the least suspenseful.  Cannot come up with anything good to say about this awful book.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This is a good show, not for kids though.  There is sex and nudity and bad language, but you get addicted to the characters and the show.  I have the other seasons too, they are all good.
B002APU580|1.0|I cannot add much to the many wonderful well documented reviews of this movie that I have read. I just wanted to add my one star to theirs. This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is terrible.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This  game is my favorite game on my Kindle Fire!!  This game is so addictive and it takes a lot is practice top master it!!  My high score is 721698!!  You should buy this game because it is cheap and the best game EVER!!!!!

1616550414|5.0|This book will be great if you are a fan of Zelda! I like this book because it contains many informations about Zelda.
1592407889|5.0|I couldn't put this book down so I was glad I was on a plane and didn't have to! I was alternately heartbroken and amazed as Sachi took me on her journey. A truly compelling and beautifully written tale, this isn't a slam of her mom, Shirley Maclaine but it is a truthful tale that leaves me longing for an epiloque where Shirley would  take her daughter lovingly in her arms, and tell her she's sorry for any pain she may have caused by neglecting her little girl. Now that would be a spiritual awakening!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|How do you download it. I need help write back plezzzzzzz I want the new version now I/  want to see Rome.
0143119680|5.0|This was a great story.  I would recommend waiting to read this until all three books are out so you can read all three at once.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Won't let me or I don't even know cuz I'm new to my kindle so plz tell me how to update. It
B008YU0AOE|3.0|What can I say!?  Just a calculator that does its job ...  Free, no frill calculator I downloaded for my new Kindle Fire HD.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Omg! It was one of the best books ever. I can't wait for the next book, and a new serie
B0063GORYU|4.0|another form of enjoyment and or relaxation which is the reason i choose to download it recommended only if you enjoy this type of game.
0307744434|2.0|The story wandered, character development was weak, and the ending seemed to have occured because the author didn't know what else to do with plot. The best parts of the book were the descriptions of the circus
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy studing the bible and I also reveive daily devotionals, and live feeds from my church through you version.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|This is such a great album. I have bought eight - one for me - the rest for family and friends. The harmony of their voices is so amazing. See them in person if you get a chance!
1616550414|5.0|If you love Zelda, you're going to love this book. So much detail!  Inside & out, this book is gorgeous!
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I wanted a basic drawing app.  This app has everything but the kitchen sink.  Cool drawing tools. easy to use and the kids love to tinker with.  Works well on my Kindle fire HD.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|if you are looking for a book similar to 50 Shades of Grey then this is the book to read
1451695195|4.0|If Dr. Alexander had used nearly any other title for his book, I would have ranked it five stars.<br /><br />Despite its sophomoric title, though, his storytelling abilities, and certainly his platform, make this a very worthwhile book.  He had a &#34;NDE&#34; and tells of it well.  I see through Amazon that someone's written a Christian Rebuttal to this book, which surprises me because the core of what Dr. Alexander describes shows little or not conflict with the new testament.<br />  &#34;You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever,&#34;<br />  &#34;You have nothing to fear&#34; (both old and new Testaments are filled with the phrase &#34;Fear Not.&#34;<br />  &#34;There is nothing you can do wrong.&#34;  Well . . . . he also gives the universes enough evil to allow free will.  It's charming.
031250926X|5.0|My 23 month old son LOVES the original of this book so much that I decided to buy it for him. (we checked the original out from the library). He loves the slide one even more! Practicing colors, animals & noises are so fun with this book.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I've become an Angry Birds addict.  That's what I do with my first cup of coffee as I try to wake up.  I've gone through all of the releases, but Space and Star Wars are the best I believe.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|So I'm 23 years old and even now I can appreciate this type of film. In addition to the dvd theres bonus material. I like how it discusses the way they filmed it back then. I love david lynch movies. The DVD comes in a fancy pancy hard metal case also.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|at first I thought this game was too easy for me.but as I soon found out that was not to be. really like it.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I absolutely love the books, but unfortunately the 4-book bundle was a bit of a burden.  I didn't realize it would download the books as a single file, so the Kindle recognized the purchase as a single book rather than four individual books.  As a result, it was nearly impossible to tell where I was in each novel.  If I had to do it over, I probably would have bought the books individually.  The books were incredibly well-written and very engaging, I can't wait for the rest of them to come out!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is a really great game but needs some improvement. There a few bugs to work out with movement and attack but its just slightly glitchy.
1451695187|4.0|The book was great and proof of God's greatness. I could not let it go once I began reading it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Its a good app, don't get me wrong. BUT, BUT, there is a fatal crash bug where you try to open it and it crashes. There is no fix and you have to uninstall and re install. Lose all progress :(. Will give 5 stars when fixed.
B000005S0D|5.0|Recently discovered Camel and it's various members.  As a result, I have purchased several albums by Camel, APP, Pilot and Keats to see what they are about.  Stationary Traveller is one of my favorites so far.  The music and musicianship on this album is top notch.  I only wish I had found out about them in the 70's and 80's.  Highly recommended.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is such a fun game! I love playing but there is so much that they want to post on facebook and then there is the few things that require cash. Overall it is a pretty good game!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We can't say enough about this product.  The digital version was very easy to use and we enjoyed all the episodes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|For a 49 year old this is a great game. It does makes me a little dizzy at times. But I can't put it down.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I love this series!  I bought the first book on February 26th and it is now March 1st and I'm halfway through the third book!  It is very well written and has great characters and story line.  The pricing is great right now and it is well worth the money.  You will not regret it!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|you do same things over and over again. there is no point. the characters all suck, same with the boards. every thing is over prised in the game.
0792839749|5.0|Another great movie. Laughed and laughed so hard. I really enjoyed it and will watch it many more times over and over.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|My timer is stupid if I want a sleep timer I have to hear this stupid crackling noise the whole time.don't waste it time buy another one.I suggest not to buy this app.
B000LXH11C|5.0|Heard a few songs on the radio and thought they were good.  Had to buy it and loved listening to it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|it takes FOREVER to get enough money to buy characters and boards. I think unordered to make this game a little better, it should lower the prices
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Watched it on tv and loved it. Cannot wait to watch it again from start to finish and then onto the next season.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Although I had a tough time getting through the first half of the book due to boredom, the second half was very good and kept me wanting to know what happened next. The end was a bit of a slaughtered but I became so involved with the characters that I would stop reading for the day yet couldn't wait to see what happened next. The end was kind oh disappointing but came out kind of how I was expecting.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Watched it on tv and loved it. Cannot wait to watch it again from start to finish and then onto the next season.
B007XF4J70|2.0|Of course this is a perfect movie, but...<br />...this is a VERY VERY VERY grainy Blu Ray. I don't know if it's a bad transfer or what.<br />Maybe there's a better Blu Ray version out there.<br />Again, great film, though.
B009AMALGM|5.0|Bought the other ones and had to buy this one also. It is so great and I look forward to seeing more.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|Nothing to get excited about but it works as it should and allows you to charge your camera on the go.
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|The first time that I heard this group, I fell in love with their music.  I kepp buying more and more from them.

B0000DZEE3|5.0|Another great cd. Not what I expected from them at all. A new experience that I want to pass along to others
1451627297|2.0|I ADMIRE Stephen King, in fact, I'm a big fan, but I don't like the presentation of my book. The book arrived folded at the corners, as if it came used ... does not seem right that if we ask new merchandise is sent to us in these conditions
B0064IOZY4|1.0|Good story about how the songs were written. But not so much into the end result. Wouldn't buy again. Nope
B006GWO5NE|5.0|works great. seems like it charges faster, not sure why. I bent my first cable, so this was a replacement.  I can't believe i had to do a minimum amount of words. crazy.
0062231375|5.0|I'm a 27 year old man, recently bachelorized to live on my own.  My relation to food is onefold: survival; I could care very little when it comes to fancy restaurants.  Yet this book took me to a very emotional place on a subject that matters so little.  The writing style was so playful, so irreverent, that reading it made me feel like peaking inside the mind of a criminal.  I also could not help but drool over flood of adjectives that described the majesty of food he experienced around the world.  As a playground ruled by meritocracy, the kitchen awards hard work and places premium on showing up on time.  Tony embraced the work ethics, and through all the coke and alcohol binge, he paid his dues and eventually became a captain of his own ship. I also like that he gave credit to where it's due, the industrious immigrant workers, for allowing the industry to become what it is today.<br /><br />The glory, the boils on his hands, the treachery of his crews, and the love for his fellow crooks/cooks, I felt it all through this little memoir.  And it was quite a ride.
B008220DIC|5.0|This film portrays the beginning of a \\"self-help religion\\" in the American 1950s when people were searching for something more spiritually.  It highlights the charlatan qualities of a master who knows how to control others.  This is an excellent film for those working with victims of spiritual/religious abuse.  However, there are a few scenes that portray nudity and sexually explicit themes, so viewer be aware of those scenes.
B004N8CP8K|2.0|This product did not work for the application I was trying to get to. I couldn't find any instructions to get me where I needed to go.
B009LRE040|5.0|It is hard to follow The Dark Night in terms of a sequel.  Heath was just awesome as the Joker, and I wondered if the third movie could deliver.  This movie fits well into the series.  I still like the 2nd one best, but this is a great movie as well.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Maybe because I am from Alabama, high school and college football is our purpose in life. We live it 365 days of the year. No off season for us. I loved the relationship of Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw. She is a VERY strong women, but she respects her husband. My favorite part was when all the coaches come to visit Michael at home.  Watch this movie.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Even if you are not into super heros and comic books this is a good movie.  I can't wait to see Avengers 2
B003ASLJO0|5.0|From A fistfull of Dollars to Dirty Harry to Unforgiven to Gran Torino. What a gift to watch a master at work. The only problem I have is that I have a hearing problem and Clint talks so low and gravely, I have trouble hearing  the dialogue. But no problem......I just watch it over and over. Thank you Mr. Eastwood, you have brought much joy to this gal's life. I have been going to your movies since 1970, at a drive-in. Youngsters run and ask your parents or grandparents what a drive-in is. It was wonderful. OH Wait I forgot. I watched Clint in Rawhide on T.V. before all the movies.
B0050PYNP8|2.0|It was purchased and sent to the UK (it didn't  work in that country) The DVD  was as described and<br />received in a timely manor
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love it! I'm hallways skimming through thing wishing I can read them when its more convint. evernote save anything so I can even read offline.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Not as good as the first but definitely better than the second.  Didn't see the ending coming, kept wondering what else is left, enjoyed it till the last page.
6301971272|5.0|Glad to have it in my home. Learned that it was not filmed in the U.S. I like the Civil War parts.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Not exactly the type of book you read to escape your own torrid life. Yet it makes you think and it makes you smile at things we don't even like to talk about let alone think on.
B00004XPPC|5.0|Was shipped quickly and securely, price was good and I am glad to add this dvd to my collection, thanks.
B006O99SYA|5.0|Starts off really strange, one keeps waiting for the characters to begin to relate, but they never do and nor are they supposed to. This book is almost like reading a case-study with its curiously dispassionate observations and in doing so allows the reader to get completely absorbed in a story of hope despite the most hopeless loss of all.
B0074MZSPO|4.0|The album kicks off with the &#34;Hold on&#34; single...one of the best songs of the year....then the album solidly troops along with old fashioned soulful tracks. While good and easy to enjoy, they don't have the energy of that lead track.<br />On vinyl it came with a bonus 7 inch 3 track recording...with the oversize hole (for duke boxes?) ...I need an adaptor so I still have yet to try out the 7 inch!...I have about 1000 albums ...this is the only one I've seen needing the adaptor.
B004SIP8SY|5.0|Tarantino isn't for everyone i'll admit. But with his kill bill part 1 and 2 he really nails it. the fight choreography and dialogue are exceptional and this is a fitting end to the tale of the bride. the picture quality is great and looks wonderful on my blu ray player. extras are mild, but when you pay $5 for this im not gonna complain.<br /><br />a must buy!!!
B007LYB0PC|5.0|I love this album. The tracks are original and challenging. a bit white stripes...with a more complete sound...and more piano lead.<br />The artwork (on vinyl) is moody and beautifully presented....great deal with the digital download....I burnt a CD for both cars...album for the lounge.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|got my sister these for christmas and i was blown away by the packaging. very neat and tightly shut. the handles are very bright and add the right fezazz your kitchen has needed. each tool is useful and the price isnt that bad for the name and everything you get.<br /><br />a 5.............out of 5
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great quality. Wish it was a little easier but very addicting and a fun game. A lot of the stuff in the store is a lot of money.
B007N3A2F0|5.0|I've been a huge Sonata Arctica fan since the debut of Ecliptica. I have stayed with them through the good times and the bad (unit). they started off as power metal, then gradually started getting more and more progressive. by the time The Days of Grays came out, sonata had developed a more unique sound. trying new things, new sounds, and not just double bass and solos. But really thats what makes sonata, sonata. the double bass and solos are their bread and butter. They own the formula and have a ton of albums that are fantastic to attest to this. But here we have something new. With the coming of this album Sonata is no longer a power metal band. They have molded into a very VERY progressive metal band now. Unia scared me and Days of Grays took getting used to. But i am a die hard fan and love this band. But this is truly a wonderful album all the way through.<br /><br />I miss the old stuff, but i enjoy the heavy folk influence that Sonata acquired with this album. Cinderblox is my favorite tune and it definitely has some old sonata fused with the new. I have a right is more of a unia feel to me but i still really really enjoy it. There are going to be alot of haters with this album because they demand the band go back to the source material. This is an awesome record and i highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates great instrumentals and wonderful musicianship.<br /><br />Sonata will always be strong for me and i will always be beside them. check it out guys
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Anime is always a turn off to many outside of the lore. but oh my goodness, Redline is the definition of what anime is haha. by far one of the most entertaining full length features to hit the anime world in a while. this movie never stops the bloodflow and the animation is AMAZING. The detail and facial expressions are ecstatic. The story is a bit out there but if you like anime you should already own this.<br /><br />Think vigilante 8 + FLCL and you have Red Line. its a must see people
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game is not only pretty and peaceful, but it will definitely challenge your problem - solving skills. Well worth downloading!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Kept reading until it was finished! I am so glad I started to read this trilogy. Definitely worth your time!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for horse lovers! It keeps me entertained for hours! The graphics are clear and the objectives keep it interesting.
1607066017|5.0|What else is there to say that hasn't already been said about Saga? It's a story about the daughter of two people from two rival planets who fell in love. Basically, it's Romeo and Juliet if they lived... except with plenty of adult themes, bounty hunters, 1/2 ghosts,  villains with a television for a head and a cat that can tell when someone is lying.
B00ARAO720|4.0|It was a fairly fast paced movie. I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I did. I am not going to spoil the movie. It isn't a \\"must see\\" movie, but if you want to watch something that will entertain you, but not leave you with much to talk about afterwards, it'll do over a lot of movie with too much hipe and not much to deliver on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|you have no idea how good this game is it is the....................AWESOMEST OF THE AWESOME. it has been AWESTRUCK woooooooooohoooooooooo
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is a thinker type game. Move are made with the next step in mind.  It is challenging and makes you use your brain. Fun.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It is a interesting game that have seen no bug in so far.  I am playing on a Acer android.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|If you like shows like NCIS, Bones, Law and Order, you will probably love Castle.<br /><br />Just as well written as the others, but in a lighter style-no 'the world is going to end because of this terrorist' NCIS like stories.<br /><br />If you have never seen Castle, The lead is played by Kate Beckett, a (the) top NYPD homicide detective.  She gets paired with Rick Castle, an author of murder mysteries, like James Patterson (who makes occasional guest appearances playing himself) who gets a permanent 'ride along' gig with Beckett, courtesy of Castle's friendship with the Mayor (they play cards weekly). Turns out, Castle is actually good at solving murders, especially odd ones. And of course, just like Bones, a love interest develops between Rick and Kate.<br /><br />They keep the series light, mostly with Castle doing goofy things, things that only he could get away with, because a) he is a writer, not a pro, and b) because he is one of the mayor's best friends. Things like getting his own Kevlar vest, with WRITER on it, or Castle installing an Espresso machine in the precinct, because he hates their coffee.<br /><br />All-in-all, a nice enjoyable series.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo24EVDC5AUWQXS]]Hipe 8 LED night light is a light and motion sensitive light. It turns on only when ambient light reaches a certain degree of low illumination. I am attaching a video which demonstrates how it turns on in the dark, and does not turn on from the same motion when the light is on. In my experiments it reliably senses motion within 55\\" (4.6 feet).<br /><br />I am also attaching a collage of two photos. The first photo show a close-up of the light with the lights on. The lights are covered with frosted cover, so it does not hurt to look straight at the light. The second photo shows how much light the light generates it total darkness with a set of fresh batteries (some of the stock photos make it appear brighter than it is in reality).<br /><br />The light has three settings: an off position, an always on position, and auto which activates the motion detector. It operates on 4 AA batteries, inserted in the compartment on the back of the unit. On the front of the unit there is a red led which starts flickering every 5 seconds when battery power is low. The unit is 4.5 inches in diameter.<br /><br />The light comes with two mounting hardware options a double sticky tape and a screw (with a hollow wall jacket).<br /><br />I placed this light in the basement in a dark area where I don't have enough light to see the shelves and it does a nice job of providing light only when I need it.<br /><br />I received the light from manufacturer for testing and review. I put it through a number of tests so I can provide honest and unbiased feedback, and I am always happy to answer comments if I did not cover some aspect of its functionality.<br /><br />Ali Julia review
B0059XTUB8|4.0|This was a good movie and the actors did a wonderful job with an interesting story line. It showed the fragile and self-abusive side of Marilyn.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|The children enjoyed it, but didn't ask to see it a second time.  I thouht it was well done, but it is Tim Burton so I expected it to be.  Way to scary in some places for littles who are sensative, but lovely story none the less.
B00127RAJY|5.0|OK, first of all, this is not a 20 minute routine, it is 30 at least for the first two levels.  With that said I really like it.  I have not done aerobics nor running in a long time and found these routines to be a great workout and energizing.  Jillian keeps you moving the entire time.  I do these only 2 times a week, but find it very helpful.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game kept my interest from beginning to end. I rarely finish a game without switching to another, but not this one. I played it on my KFHD8.9. Everything played smoothly.This game wasvery enjoyable and a lot of fun. Thanks for a great game. Nancy Bettac Barton, grammacozy62
B007HACDLK|5.0|Full disclosure. I just download today and quickly read the first three pages. It's classic Rapp, which means nothing less than five stars.<br /><br />I'll update but there's no way I'm going to lower the score.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Great mode music. Well produced and arranged. Guitar back ground Inspirational. Andrea Bocelli was fabulous as usual. Steven Foster just gets better and better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is just so much fun! It takes everything I love about the first Temple Run game and really expands on it. There are tons of new characters and upgrades. The graphics of Temple Run 2 are simply fantastic and very life like. I could play this game for hours on end without getting bored! I highly recommend this fantastic game!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Funny how a simple game is addictive. I guess it takes me back to my childhood and going to the carnival at fair time.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I am sorry to say that I started watching this about 4 seasons too late. I love the characters who have a good sense of depth and warmth. The humor is seems very erratic but it all comes together very well. Although this is all &#34;Ted-centric&#34; all the characters do have cameos of their lives and it helps make a solid connection with the audience. This is one of the few shows I follow because it's so enjoyable.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|Teach yourself JS and HTML5 it's whats hip and new in the web front so definitly check it out :) TYAY\o/
B008XG1X18|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating because of the many different and interesting ideas, projects, and recipes that can be found there. i have made several recipes, made a couple of holiday projects for my home, got party ideas for kids parties, and have seen many things I am interested in looking into further. I have been signed in as part of pinterest for a while but at first didn't understand how it all worked. Now I have a hard time getting away from it. I have been recommending to friends and family, cautiously, because it could be additive! lol
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Does exactly what it's supposed to do. No longer available in Google play, so get it while you can. Thank you.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|Great movie!! I paid a great price for it and it came with an amazon copy that I can watch whenever from my amazon account.
B00B01XDTI|3.0|The acting wasn't bad. It was just kind of boring and not scary. It needed some more twists and turns.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addictive & the changing cities keep it fresh & new.I will keep playing as long as it stays new and fresh
B000YH6YG8|5.0|ship very fast and a very good movie as will. dvd was packed very will and came with no damage at all
B002I0J5FG|5.0|If you like puzzle games mixed with intrigue and excitement, this collection is for you.<br /><br />Ico is a slower, more puzzle-based game.  It can stress you out at times, but I think that is part of the fun!  It is so rewarding when you figure out how to solve a puzzle.  The concept of progressing through a crazy maze in the form of a castle is fantastic!<br /><br />Shadow of the Colossus, on the other hand, is a faster-paced game depending more on skill, but it still requires a lot of thought and planning.  It is very challenging, but extremely rewarding.<br /><br />Both games are masterpieces, in my opinion.  Interesting, Ico came out first, but chronologically it actually occurs after Shadow of the Colossus.  I have found it very enjoyable to play both concurrently.  If you pace yourself in Shadow of the Colossus and make sure that you finish it after finishing Ico, it is a great experience.  Ico can get a little exhausting, so it is nice to play Shadow of the Colossus as a change of pace.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and eagerly await the third installment.
B000268QB2|3.0|love 3 songs better just download the songs instead of buying whole cd but each there own its okay though
B004W2UBYW|4.0|From the beginning, to the end Steve was a man of strong will and determination. Like a child wanting to do everything on their own. He was misunderstood and worshipped at the same time by the same people.<br /><br />It is an understatement to say our world is a better place because of Steve Jobs. Steve gave us what he wanted us to have, not the faster horse.<br /><br />Walter Isaacson provides a balanced view of a simple but complicated person. It must have been hard at times Walter to be in the same room with Steve Jobs, as he knew that Steve could fly off into a rant at anytime.<br /><br />Nice job Mr. Isaacson. I enjoyed reading your book and will us it as a life full of lessons to be learned and shared.
B00632HWOG|5.0|love this app make it sooo soo so so easy for me to check my email from anywhere from my cell!!
B000XXTCF8|5.0|Good sound, great music. Good service. I don't know what more to say but I have to write sixteen words
B0012PDVUS|5.0|Beautiful, thought provoking, and forever changed the way we imagine the future. See it immediately if you haven't already. This edition is finally the one that Ridley Scott fully had control over.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|works real well and its free. fun and challeging to play. pretty hard levels for me. I use it on my tablet.
B0014GVCI8|5.0|I love this movie. Because it was made in Minnesota and I recognize the locations shot. Ellen Page is perfect for the character she plays and the storyline is believeable in todays world.
B00B7FW6U4|2.0|After watching the movie for about five minutes it would pause and I have to buffer the video then it would play for about five minutes and then buffer for another five minutes we ended up giving up after about 30 minutes of this. We use a 40 megabit internet service provider... Amazon really needs to work on their servers to stream video properly. This isn't the first time this is happened I've had it happen on about three other movies as well I am done trying.
B003CN4R74|5.0|The musicians and direction this band took on this album is eye opening. It's grand in every sense of the word, harder and with meaning. The first two albums are great and their 3 ep's also but this album is the best of them all. Songs like: \\"The Otherside, Sick, Never going Back, Made Of Stone\\" are some of the highlights of this album. From top to bottom, Amy Lee delivered incredibly.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|I had heard this series mentioned in several places but never bothered to watch it. My wife and i watched the pilot movie on a Friday and enjoyed it so much we had watched the entire series and the second movie by Sunday. It is a great series and had wonderful characters... I just wish there were more to watch now.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY ENJOYED ALL 3 SEASONS THAT I HAVE PURCHASED AND CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR SEASON 4 TO BE AVAILABLE.
030759565X|5.0|Reading and eating are two of my favorite things, and this book addresses them both. I had seen Deb Perelman's work referenced in other cookbooks and was curious about her blog. After reading some of her entries, I decided I needed this book in my collection. I have since recommended it to several friends, and I think they would all agree that the recipes and the narratives are equally good. Everything I've tried has been delicious, and I think this will continue to be one of my go-to books when I'm feeling creative in the kitchen.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|ALTHOUGH I USED AT LEAST A HALF BOX OF TISSUES DURING THIS SEASON, I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED.  I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR SEASON 4.  MAGGIE SMITH IS AWESOME.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|I love it and get enjoy  of that.The tune of music is beautiful and singers play so good! I made this gift for myself and I'm happy!
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I guess I'm just not into literature where you have to read slowly to understand what is being said. I'll go see the movie!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I Loved the suspense and the cleverness of the main character. Very well written book. I was so easy to read and understand.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|The review sounded pretty good but I just couldn't stay with it.. a little slow getting going...maybe I should have stuck with it a bit longer!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It was a fun game but it needs more characters. I wish that they would add the football player and the cowboy guy into the game.
B007L5GDGW|1.0|Even as a FAOTD this is overpriced.  I'd rather have a bought with IBS than play this crummy game.  It's that bad.
0979019710|5.0|I recently got this book and read it in no time.I also started implementing into my life immediately.I  find myself<br />everyday ready to get up and start my day.And I can feel a change occurring within me.I have also bought one for a dear friend.Because I wanted To pay it forward but I want to keep my own copy.I am going to get a few more to give out as well.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to see a change come into their life.Thank you Hal..
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I figured this would be another game to pass time quickly.  However, I really enjoy it.  It is a kind of Four Rivers game, but the 3-D ability to rotate the cube around as you make your matches really make it more interesting and fun.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout even though I hate her when I am going the video, you can tell by her face expressions and how she talks to you that she wants you to kick your own ass into shape she doesn't want you to stop she wants you to keep moving and push your body hard, when I feel like stoping I just think that's my mind saying stop and I force my body to keep going, I always keep her voice in my head and I say to myself if I'm not fainting, throwing up, I don't need to stop just keep breathing.. I am doing this work out so I can at least jump start my weightlost and build my intensity for insanity! Don't get me wrong there are 3 Levels to this work out and the first one starts off hard because there's no stoping and your working your body hard, today will be Day 3 on level 1, I all do this for another 7 days, then do level 2 for 10 days and level 3 for the last 10 days, I hope to lose at least 10 pounds.. My start weight is 188.. Ill update in two weeks how much weight I lost so far..
B000U7SN8O|5.0|This set of songs is so fresh and different than most of the music being churned out now.  The band makes use of some unusual instrumentation which is so creative and hauntingly beautiful.
B008LFY6NI|4.0|This app is super cute and fun to use. The colors cone out so vibrant and pretty. My kids love it. I would have given it 5 stars if you didn't have to buy more things to paint. You get 5 or 6 shapes to do and then there are two different packages you can buy. The shapes that come with get old kind fast. Its fun kids love it, and it does the trick for keeping them occupied for a min. But like I said u can only color the same pic so many times.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A series for all ages! I am 66 yrs. old and don't think I've read a trilogy that has captivated me as much as this one. Adventure, suspense, romance....what more can you ask for.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a great game that I like to play and its great how the cities change  and that's a cool thing :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a really fun way to spend the time. It is entertaining and challenging to find all the eggs and get coins to unlock boards and characters.
B007L5GDGW|5.0|Graphics are beautiful.. Very addicting.. Permissions are great.. Thank you for not latching on to my contacts, GPS, network, etc
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is so so so so so so so so cool. It is like temple run two. U will loooooooove it.
1439148953|2.0|After thinking it over I went down from 3 stars to 2 based on the question \\"Would I recommend this book to someone?\\"  The answer was no.  I initially enjoyed it (after a slow start) as I tried to imagine my own grandmother emigrating to America from Ireland.  But then what?? We don't even know how old the main character Eillish is. And the detail is in the wrong place.  No explanation of departing the ship, getting through Ellis Island, making her way to her new home, her impressions of  that first view of America?  But we get details of a dance?  We get details of how to balance the books at a business in Ireland?  Is this book self-published?  It does not seem to benefit from any editing.  I would have loved more detail of Eillish getting to know her professor, a recent  survivor of the Holocaust.  The author gave us a few lines regarding that and I thought \\"ooo this story is about to get interesting.\\"  But no, nothing, nada. And no more mention of the original ship-mate who I found a stronger character -- she could have been a good example for Eillish. But no, we never hear of her after the initial ship scenes.  How old was Tony?  This book took place circa 1950-- had he fought in the recent WW2?  This story had soooo  much potential.  No depth whatsoever.  What a let-down.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|In This Moment delivers another solid album.  I enjoyed nearly every track on this album.  Their sound has developed in a slightly different direction, less old school string-dancing mania and more nu-metal with just a small dash of dubstep (not my favorite, but they don't over-do it, so it works).  Maria Brink delivers her amazing vocals, from melodic to demonic.  The whole thing is great!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Great book. Written very well and keeps you hooked through out the hole book. Recommend this book to anyone into this style of fantasy books.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Much like Beautiful Creatures, Beautiful Darkness is a good book that fell short of becoming great. It could have been so much better if more effort had been put into the writing.<br /><br />I'm a firm believer that characters should drive the plot not vice versa. In this novel however, the characters feel underdeveloped and the actions they take seem unbelievable done deliberately to force a certain plot line. Sadly, the only characters that seem well developed are Link and Ridley which is probably why I like them so much more than the main characters.<br /><br />If underdeveloped characters were the only problem with this novel I would be happy to give it at least for stars, but that's not the case. Over and over again I found myself zoning out half-way through a paragraph. Rarely did I feel glued to the pages like I usually am when I read a book. The story just moved so slowly... I found myself wondering if it would ever end rather than hoping it would never end. The plot of this 500+ page book could have fit in 250-300 pages easily. I honestly can't remember 500+ pages worth of story now that I have finished the book.<br /><br />At this point if I read the rest of the books in the series it will be because I hate leaving things unfinished, not because I'm in love with the story.
1594487154|5.0|Great, Easy read, Highly Recommend<br /><br />I am a guy who likes to learn about verbal/non-verbal communication, how to sell not just product/services, but how to &#34;sell&#34; me to others. For example, I find this book highly useful in improving my skills in dating. You meet the girl and you sell yourself to her in a very effective and subtle way so you don't come off as desperate.<br /><br />The book doesn't mention a word about dating, but selling is an idea and technique you can apply to any and all situations. Buy it, I promise you it's a great read :)
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Hilarious!  Seth MacFarlane is a comic genius.  I hope there is a Ted sequel in the future.  I am still laughing.
B0011XBLV2|3.0|The movie itself is very good -- not a &#34;western&#34; in the standard sense, but much deeper with a stylized focus on the characters.  It makes very heavy use of closeups and facial expressions, letting the characters' and raw reaction to events speak louder than their words.<br /><br />The quality of the streaming is so bad though.  It's so bad that it's distracting.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|It was an ok action movie.  Not the original, but ok in its own right. I am glad I didn't buy the movie!  :)
B00AMHFMIG|5.0|The first time I heard of this show, I thought it would be lame.<br />Then, I happened to catch an episode on TBS and fell in love with the &#34;wine gang!&#34;<br />It is now my favorite tv show!<br />This season shows the progression from the first two shows being ok...and how it progressed into the wonderfully funny and yet, heart warming sitcom!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great for those who don't want to spend a lot of money on headphones.  Want headphones that won't break.  Or if you just don't like ear buds.  These headphones work great.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I bought this after a reading the great reviews it recieved in several magazine articles.<br />WOW! They were all 100% correct...this is one I will listen to for the rest of my life!<br />This man is gifted with musical talent!!!
8866130907|5.0|This is a nice and compact calendar with enough space to write thanks to the opposite page used just for notes.  Thanks for making such a useful and nice looking product.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was.....wow. not your typical Nicholas sparks love story....I can not wait to see this movie I hear great things =)
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I didn't want to see this movie, but it was my boyfriend's turn to pick.  I will admit, I groaned and grumbled this movie was picked.  Much to my surprise, it was a hit!  Very funny and enjoyable movie.
B00466HN6S|4.0|:) Perfect for kids of all ages, me and my family all enjoyed this cute little movie, Glad its in my collection.
1616550414|5.0|It's just perfect, you feel happy only seeing it, foe every person that love zelda this book is like a bible!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the funniest game i ever played its so exciting and challenging i love this game the most because the theme keeps changing i love the egg hunt they just started in Rome subway surfers download this game its fun and the greatist part about it is its FREE!!!!!!!!
B006XOBFJC|5.0|Do not pay any attention to negative reviews of this Ring.  Believe me when I say that they are written by ignorant people whose views and observations are such that they appear to have studied scores and listened to recordings for as many minutes as I have years.  (One supposed critic peripherally singles out Reiner Goldberg as the \\"worst\\" Siegfried recorded.  I hate to disillusion someone so, but to anyone who knows what a heldentenor is supposed to sound like, he's arguably the BEST.  He has a voice like that of Ernst Kozub, another underrated but wonderful dramatic tenor.  Check out his Max in the Freischutz DVD in which he appears.  Watch him closely in the Freischutz.  Both he and Goldberg sing with seemingly effortless production but full, ringing sound...a sure sign of great vocal technique.<br /><br />For only $25, this Ring is an incredible bargain...more than worth this bargain price...You cannot go wrong.<br /><br />I'm not going to repeat points that others have so admirably stated or argued, but I would like mention a few things that may have missed.<br /><br />First...three of a countless number of details Janowski follows that most don't.<br /><br />In the Walkure scene, he sticks to the script and has Rossweise sing her complete line solo, \\"...nach alhall brechen wir auf, Wotan zu bringen die Wal.\\"  Having this line sung by the group is idiotic.  It interrupts the conversational tone of the scene.<br /><br />In Act II of Gotterdammerung, he is one of only three conductors I know of who have the male chorus enter correctly.  The others are Furtwangler in the RAI Ring, Moralt in the 1949-50 Vienna Ring and Leinsdorf in the 1959-60 MET Ring.  Most recordings have the whole chorus group sing from the start.  Wagner clearly indicates that first one, then another one, then two, then four...then finally the whole chorus enters.  When done correctly, the effect is extremely striking and dramatically \\"right.\\"  There is a reference in Cosima's diary on the day he thought of idea of having them enter this way.  If anyone knows of another recording that follows this important musical direction, PLEASE let me know.<br /><br />Also, in Act II of Gotterdammerung, Salminnen (most likely at Janowski's insistence) sings his notes in the scene leading up the the great concluding trio with chilling accuracy...hearing the right notes being sung make the lines truly frightening.<br /><br />Wagner would greatly approve of Janowski's approach and tempi.  He didn't want his huge orchestra to blare out like a brass band, but to be used sensitively, more often than not, in small chamber-like groups.  If Cosima's diary is to be believed, he was forever railing against conductors for dragging the tempos.  By all accounts, he would NOT approve of the slow sanctimonious approach typified by the likes of Goodall, Levine and sometimes Furtwangler.  For example, he felt that Gotterdammerung should run just a bit over 4 hours...not 4 1/2 or 5!!<br /><br />The singing is overall very pleasing with no ugly voices or wobbles; their strengths far outweigh any weaknesses and some roles are expertly handled.  Take Altmeyer, for example.  She is no Nilsson, Valkki, Grob-Prandl, or Synek, but she's a hell of a lot better than recent monstrosities e. g. G. Jones, L. Watson and she's certainly superior to Voigt's recent MET Brunnhilde.  The Rheinmaidens, Norns, and Walkures are individually excellent singers and the three groups are VERY well balanced groups.  The Walkures are particularly strong and are able to make the most of their beautiful concerted passage beginning \\"Zu uns floh die Verfolgte,\\" soon after Wotan's furious entrance.  For this passage to work, the voices must be able to sing softly in the high register, a tall order for most Walkures.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have to say this is a fun game to play especially when I'm in school and have nothing to do
B0011ZYIZQ|5.0|This is great music. Ms. Baker is an outstanding entertainer. I was lucky enough to see her in NYC many years ago. Sure wish she'd do something current.
B0097AX6EQ|4.0|Fantastic story of the journey travelled by chopper pilots from training to operations in a highly dangerous war zone.mason takes us through a no holds barred roller coaster ride of his early days in the initial deployment of air cav. Here is another story of a warrior who saw and dealt with terrible battle scenes and danger. It is a fantastic story and one feels great empathy for Mason and his comrades.This is an iconic Vietnam story. Highly recommended.
B003MC5N28|5.0|i choose this rating because it is truly an amazing book. i would recommend this too young adults. fantastic book
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I gave this book a 5 because I couldn't put it down once I started to read it. I got this book because it's a novel we have to read in my school. I would recommend this book for students and people who like to explore their imagination.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I absolutely love this app. The alarm is loud enough to wake me. Wich I am a very hard sleeper. I also enjoy having the weather on there !!!!!-

1609611543|4.0|I changed my diet to all wheat as I thought this was healthier. If that is you also, you must read this book. I have only done this for one week but feel so much better. I can't wait to see how I feel in a month.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Compelling finely drawn characters in an engrossing tale in the period of time in the late 17th and 18th century that gives a detailed picture of the life of slaves and their extended families.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|There are I believe several thousand added words in this version of the book, and the book is even better for it.  I find it hard to believe that any of them were necessary to have removed in the first place.
B0058VW36U|1.0|This app stinks! I paid 99 cents for this app and it still wont even install!! This is a joke of an app.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|You will not stop reading this book. Will and Layken were meant for each other.<br /><br />What are the chances of loosing your parents and feel that you have to take care of your sibling? It was sad, funny, sweet, crazy love, loving love, true love. A must read!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Sensitive, well written story. One gets into the head of these young people whose lives have been compromised. Good read!
B003Y5H53S|1.0|I watched this with my 8 year old boy. I was disgusted with the language. I couldnt believe this was rated pg. Hollywood is teaching the wrong thing to kids today. There are no moral values in this movie.
B009WJ3HY6|5.0|It sounds cleaner, crisper - and all the energy is there.  You can hear John's Bass and Keith's insanity on his drum kit much better, with more definition.  Live at Leeds is a great one - but I'm listening to the Hull show much more.
1401324649|5.0|It was an excellent book. I laughed and was amazed 'how can anyone think of all this in one book.'
B0009P66TK|5.0|Have bought 2 of this model for friends. They love it..... First watch they ever received designed for a 'lefty.'
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I bought this album on a whim from simply listening to one song. I was hooked the moment I heard the album in it's entirety. I would highly recommend this album if you like folk music.
0345525558|5.0|gives a glimpse into the mind of a child and young adolescent raised in the state system and the fears they face in a lifetime. tugs at your heartstrings and keeps you coming back, even if for only one short chapter at a time.
075669910X|5.0|Or, artistic science.  I purchased this as thank you for a scientist friend.  He loved it.  His father loved it.  When Christmas rolled around, they gave it to my friend's teenage niece who apires towards geology.  I was so happy.  It's a heave paper book with fantastic photography.  There is so much information about the evolution of life forms.  My undergraduate degree is in Earth Sciences and I think this should be used in colleges for paleontology and evolution.  Also accessible to those of general interest.  I'm finally getting my copy with my birthday money.  Fabulous, really fabulous.  For study or for coffee table.  Just makes me happy.  Please don't criticize me for a non-scientific review.  I believe its been said.  I wanted to add my five star rating.  The price is phenomenol.  It's easily a $100 text book.  A real pleasure.
B0002W19KQ|5.0|I am not one for musicals, but I am one for a good movie.  This novel adaptation is super tasty.  Gérard Depardieu and John Malkovich are perfect in their rolls as some of the best characters fiction has ever seen.  I would recommend this movie to those who have and have not read the Book by Victor Hugo.
0062080237|5.0|Beautifully written, rich, deep and satisfying, this book is one of Neil Gaiman's best. It is a great fantasy journey through the modern landscape of America, a hero quest and meditation on the evolution of religion and mythology.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|This was not a typical musical with talking and some singing (such as Dick van Dyke or Julie Andrews movies), but was singing all the way through.  The movie, based on a musical which itself is based on a book, was so-so, and should have been rated R.  It left many of us crying in the theater at the end.  I'm glad I read some of the book and know much of the original French concept album, so that I could actually understand what did NOT come through in this movie.  Thénadier and wife remind me of Bozo the Clown and what he'd have for a wife.  In the original French concept album but not the book, they actually WERE funny in their singing, but their inn was no whorehouse.  I think Hollywood overdid it with its typically dirty mind, and all in all, I was  rather disappointed.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Outstanding film for rental, well acted and directed. Well documents actual events of our past and present foreign relationships with eastern areas.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Addicting, fun, frustrating!  Almost at level six.  Much better than original Temple Run! although I played that one for centuries.
B009LUBA7M|5.0|This is by far, and without any uncertainty, the most wonderful musical experience I have had in far too long.
B004ZY0VHY|3.0|Bought and read this book on referral and the only thing that kept me going was the thought it might get better the further into the book I got.  While the story was intriguing, I found it difficult to read.  I found myself having to search the dictionary for words that even my Kindle couldn't define which was frustrating. The writing was not smooth and flowing, but halting.  Watching the movie was even worse.  Had I not read the book first, I would have had no concept of what the movie was about.<br />With that being said, if you can get past the writing style, the story itself was interesting.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|This was everything I'd hoped it would be.  Sinatra never sounded so good!  His breath and phrasing were unsurpassed...refreshing to hear after listening to so many of today's performers who sing only 4 or 5 notes at the most before taking a breath and/or taking a breath in the middle of a word.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Most of my family members liked this game and they liked it better than Ingenuius which is similar. The problem is that one family member has a major complaint about it. I don't know if it's coincidence with just our family, but whoever goes first always seems to win the game. Maybe we all have close enough strategies that that always happens. But we haven't played enough games for me to believe that the first person always wins.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fantastic game and if you don't have temple run then you should get it because its fun like temple run 2.
B007L5GDGW|3.0|The music's OK -- sort of a cross between Orbital and UT2003.

0439023513|5.0|You know this is a good book. The complete series is great but only good for a few reads, after reading it a few times it gets pretty old. Still worth the money though :D
0425263908|4.0|No FSOG but, good read. There is to much background for the characters. You don't really get into it until the second book.
0439023491|5.0|You know this is a good book. The complete series is great but only good for a few reads, after watching the movie a few times and reading it a few it gets pretty old. Still worth the money though :D
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game but you should add like racing and fighting back and give each on a power like make your first character he can fly 300m ahead every 100 coins for tricky if you had A racing mode tricky could dance while kicking our something or she could teleport cause she is tricky but overall this was awesome add racing and fighting
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Great show, only wish the complete series set was more affordable. Wife thought it was boring until she saw the first 2 episodes, now she's hooked!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers! I love to challenge myself to not get caught by the inspector!! I like the different holidays on there too!
B00136Q342|5.0|This is the one album everyone should own and not just because of the great music. This is the embodiment of what Johnny Cash was, a great musician, singer and performer. He does what he does best, takes country music and delivers it with passion and authenticity. Looking past the location and the music, which is now a staple of country, we get to hear a man do what he loves best. I don't think that is just music, you can hear Johnny Cash strive not only to deliver a great performance but connect with his audience. It's easy to forget that these were men in one of harshest prisons and an environment rife with despair. He does this by identifying with his audience, not just lyrics and music at it's finest but intertwined with emotion easy to feel while you listen.<br /><br />If you don't own a Johnny Cash album then buy this one, if you are a fan, then you should have bought this years ago. I had it when I was younger and lost it in a break up, and though I had all his other albums I never got back to buying this one, I now regret not getting it sooner. I'm sure you will as well once you listen.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I could see myself so often in reading this book. I have decided that I don't need to try to be more outgoing--I'm just going to be at ease with who I am. I'm retired so I don't need to be outgoing for business reasons, so what you see is what you get from now on.
B007DIQC90|4.0|I'm thoroughly enjoying this album.  I don't prefer the paper/cardboard cases like this one has, but it gets the job done.  The dropped star is due to the fact that I feel the 3 singles--Mountain Sound, Little Talks, and King and Lionheart--which I'd already heard before buying, were significantly better than the rest of the album.  They seem to have significantly more texture and polish, like they knew which ones would be popular, so they focused on those during recording and postproduction.  By no means would I call the rest of the album filler, and it's all very pleasing to listen to, the quality just seems very disjointed between these three songs and the rest of the album.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Love this book!!! Sweet story about letting your guard down and not being afraid to let love in...which is difficult for guys and girls. The characters were so likeable...almost teared up a few times
B0055IU4GM|4.0|I got this cd because I had John Hiatt's &#34;Walk On&#34; cd and love it. Walk On is still my favorite, but this is is close. I can play Hiatt's music with blues artists, classic rock, Mark Knoppfler, etc . It's just good music.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is sooo much fun! You have amazing DIY ideas humorous things fashion hair and makeup all at your fingertips. You should definitely get it!
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  I initially watched it because it stars Emma Watson and I am a big fan of her work.  Emma's performance and those of all of her co-stars were achingly beautiful.  The script was brilliant and the story completely drew me into their world.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys quality independent films; just be prepared for an experience unlike any other.
1616960922|5.0|This is just a gem of a story, and to think I almost didn’t buy it.  Why, because it just doesn’t portray much band for the buck.  I mean why spend almost $15 dollars for a ultra slim, by today’s standards, volume of only 176 pages.  Then there is my private beef with publishers the last year or two who seem obsessed with producing off size editions.  Maybe for a person that doesn’t have 4000 books on custom shelves that doesn’t matter but I like my paperbacks to fit on my paperback shelves somewhat evenly and this is both slightly taller and slightly wider that normal.<br />Luckily for me Amazon had it on sale when I was ordering some other books so I took the plunge and boy am I glad I did.  This is really a novella since there is a pretty high perchance of dialogue to description and it makes this about a 3 hour read which is pretty rare among modern books.<br /><br />The author crafts a society and a magic system in only a few short sentences and then lets the story run itself.  Shai is being held in jail awaiting judgment.  Her crime, she is a forger who using some rather tenuously explained magic system where through study and research she crafts a soul stamp that when applied to an item rewrites its history.  While this power is favored by the Empire as a way of recalling past artworks it is done more by rote by the accredited practitioners and anyone doing it on their own is an enemy of the State.  An example of this is when she uses her power to change a drab wall into one covered by a magnificent mural.  She has learned that years ago a renowned artist was sick for several months in another room in the palace and working from the assumption that he could have just as easily have been ensconced in this room rather than another and that it would have been equally possible for him to dab away at the walls while he waited to recover his strength.<br /><br />She is enlisted to perform a task of great import to the Empire, something secret that has tobe accomplished in a short time which is completely beyond the ability of the government controlled magic workers.<br /><br />What I enjoy the most about this story is that there is a “WOW” factor in the magic.  It is a highly visible thing that astounds the reader along with the people who are keeping her captive.  Too often books take their magic for granted and dwell at most on the amount of power rather than the wonder of their magic.  Because of the skill of the author I found myself revisiting several paragraphs almost as soon as I finished my initial reading.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|I actually am truly enjoying this game, BUT it is frustrating when objects are hidden under the status bar.  How am I supposed to find those without the hints? Also, I am currently on level 19 and I found all the objects and all I have to do is tap on the pair of glasses but the game won't let me. I use the hint feature and &quot;yes&quot; those are the glasses I need to find.  I tap them over and over and nothing happens.  The game times out and I have to start over.  It makes me mad because I know I am almost finished with the game.  I want to find out how the story ends.  Will she find her sister?  But now I am angry and frustrated that I can't finish the level and the game.
B005USZML4|4.0|the story kept my attention. It was a fun read. Not sure I would purchase it though. I was not aware that this was a series, that Grisham had started writing for kids.
0765325950|5.0|It's been a long road and sometimes a bumpy one,from the very beginning  &#34;Eye of the World&#34; 1990, a book I pulled off a carousel  in a stationary store while looking for a birthday card, to this last and final book, A &#34;Memory of Light&#34; 2013 .As I was reading this book I was already in mourning for the lose of this series. Can you imagine that?  All the loose stings were finally coming together, and in a great way too. I was  afraid things would never come together and never be answered, but they were. What an emotional  roll-a-coaster the last 200 pages brought me, in sorrow and happiness.<br />BRAVO Robert Jordan, may  you rest in peace knowing your mega volume Wheel of Time series has come to a wonderful end, and bravo to Brandon Sanderson for putting his vision into words.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|AWESOME IM TOTTALY ADDICTED TO YOUR GAME BUT WHEN I GET OFF THE GAME AND GO BACK ON I HAVE ZERO COINS ALL THE TIME NEFORE THIS HAPPENED I HAD 567221134 COINS CAN I GET THEM BACK THANX
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I was hooked by Season 1 of Grey's Anatomy and continued watching all available seasons.  Great show -- Love it!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This one is a page turner with interesting characters and wicked plot twists. I couldn't decide whether to admire Malcolm or hate him.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I would compare this with The Walking Dead in the sense that it is a group of people trying to live on their own after a devastating event wipes out a lot of humanity. In this case, it's just aliens instead of zombies. My husband and I started watching this a few weeks ago and have breezed through season 1. Each episode keeps you intrigued and wanting to know what happens next.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book had me hooked all the way through. The zombie apocalypse from the small band of survivors has been done, done again, and done again. This book takes you into the mind of people from all aspects of the crisis, from the lowest peasant in China to the highest officer in the US. Everyone has a different view of the events and that's what makes it interesting and different.
B000NQRE1E|4.0|I am not reviewing the movie itself, but the product and purchase of it here. The movie works great, but there is nothing special enough about this to warrant 5 stars. Fair price, good product, fair shipping. This was a sound transaction I was satisfied with.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I will always keep buying these series. I love the suspense and horror characteristics. Will do business again. Love it
0307341577|5.0|It is not often that an author is able to create characters who become as familiar and true as old friends and whose fate still haunts you in your dreams (or nightmares) long after the last page has been turned. Gillian Flynn's Dark Places is such a book, and despite having eagerly awaited the conclusion of the story and answers to all my questions, I am almost sad to part from a story which has held my undivided attention for so many hours.<br /><br />Libby Day is the only female survivor of a horrible crime - the brutal slaughter of her mother and two sisters when Libby was only seven years old. Having escaped by hiding in a dark cupboard whilst the killings took place, Libby's testimony about the events leading up to the murders and the things she heard on the night ultimately led to the arrest and prosecution of her older brother Ben, who is believed to have killed his family in a satanic ritual. Now in her early thirties, Libby's life is still overshadowed by her past. She is constantly afraid of strangers, has no friends, is estranged from her only other remaining relatives and is unemployed, living off donations of benefactors who have heard about her fate. Since the night of the murders she has had no contact with Ben, who has been sentenced to life in prison.<br /><br />But Libby's life is about to change - the money from her beneficiary fund has been almost depleted, and she is confronted with the reality of having to get her life in order and find work. Still bitter and depressed, she receives a strange offer from a stranger, Lyle, who belongs to a society of civilians investigating the murders of her family, the Kill Club, convinced that Ben is innocent and that the real murderer is still at large. Lyle wants her to be guest of honour at the group's next meeting, in exchange for a generous fee. Broke and desperate, Libby agrees. Confronted by group members, Libby is thrust back into the \\"dark place\\", her memory of the night of the murders. Knowing that her testimony of having seen Ben commit the murders was coerced and not entirely true, she lets herself be persuaded to talk to persons who could hold the key to what really happened that night, such as her alcoholic wastrel father. And though Libby is still convinced that the right person has been charged with the murders, some of the new information coming to light may challenge everything she has believed all these years....<br /><br />Flynn is a truly gifted writer, drawing the reader into the story from page one and never letting go whilst the plot slowly unravels to reveal a clever twist at the end. I never saw that one coming, although looking back there were clues which I somehow overlooked or disregarded as unimportant. By using four different narrators - with Libby's being the only first person account - the day and night of the murders slowly unfold from several viewpoints. A warning for readers who do not like violence - some of the scenes are very graphic and truly horrible, and by cleverly setting the scene and creating a chilling atmosphere the author allows no escape from the horror of it all. One particular scene towards the end of the book made my stomach churn, and yet I could not tear myself away.<br /><br />As in Flynn's other books, evil constantly simmers under the surface and many circumstances converge to lead to the central twist at the end of the book. Exploring the darkest places of the human soul, the title is very apt, although in the book it refers to Libby's memories of the fateful night. All characters are extremely well drawn. As the novel progresses, we see Libby grow from a bitter young woman to someone who takes matters into her own hands - which leaves the reader with a sense of hope despite the truly horrible themes underlying the story. As a mother, my heart went out to Patty, who is honest and hard-working, wanting only the best for her family, but having her whole life derailed by marrying the wrong man - and the spiral of poverty which sees her constantly battling to keep her family and farm afloat. The choices she must make are heartbreaking. The third person to have a voice is Ben, and even though I wanted to shake him at times it was hard not to feel empathy for this dysfunctional character as his unfortunate choices make his life rapidly spiral out of control.<br /><br />I had the audiobook version of this novel, and rate it as one of the best narrations I have ever listened to. Using different narrators for the different perspectives in the book adds depth to the characters and sets a distinctively different tone for each separate part of the novel. Each one of the four narrators did an excellent job in giving characters their own voice, and I had no trouble following the conversations between several people (which can sometimes be an issue where there are lots of different characters to keep track of). I can strongly recommend this audiobook to anyone who wants hours of riveting storytelling - I had many occasions where I sat in the driveway in the dark after work, unable to switch off the recording before I had learnt just a little bit more.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of clever atmospheric mysteries, although not for the faint hearted. I loved it - a definite five stars from me. It doesn't get much better than this.verty which sees her constantly battling to keep her family and farm afloat.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|So FREAKIN cool man like the bestest ever. I just upgraded to Rome and it so hot the best part is being able to jump over the walls and bridges
B0094K1WZE|3.0|It was even more convoluted and not that exciting, in my opinion.  Watching it for free made it more acceptable.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|If your type of scary is something jumping at you and shocking you then this is the movie for you. To be honest it was a little bit of a let down. Seems like all the movies in this family have the same exact style and this was the last one i will watch by these guys.
1605981834|2.0|Story about a completely amoral young man who wants to marry a rich woman...and has no problem killing someone if it gets in his way. I got this back when the forgotten 1991 movie version (with Matt Dillon and Sean Young) came out. I remember liking the book since it's quite different from the movie. This time around though I hated it. It starts of well enough but bogs down by the middle with characters and name changes coming quick and furious. By the end I was totally lost and didn't care what happened to the various characters. Lots of people like this so I'm in the minority.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|No issues , works fine on htc one x and galaxy s3 . No bugs whatsoever. This is a great app
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Excellent adventure movie. Daniel Craig is awesome and the story was great! Great scenes!  Action scenes were awesome and the plot was easy to follow even if you are not a Bond junkie!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie, the entire cast was excellent.  It was especially nice to see Helen Hunt and she was very very good in this.  Highly recommend.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great game to pass the time away. You can make a challenge or easy. Its up to you.  I would suggest this game to anyone.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Its a tribute to the filmaker that even though we &#34;knew&#34; how the story ended, we were on the edge of our seats to the end...highly recommend this movie!!
0446573027|3.0|Have read of few of Baldacci's books and I liked the Forgotten (#2 Puller) better than (#1 Puller) Zero Day.  I listed to both on audio and enjoy sound effects and the narrators Ron McLarty and Orlagh Cassidy made the novel very interesting.<br /><br />Again war hero, John Puller is the top investigator in the US Army CID.  As in Forgotten he is called to work the case after someone is brutally murdered in a remote area of West Virginia.  As usual, upon his investigation, there is more than meets the eye and teams up with local homicide detective Sam Cole.  There are secrets of the past and deceit surfaces.  Without giving up the ending-- A shocking conclusion of family and justice and how to make things right - A fast-paced book with battles between good and evil.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I went to the movies to watch this and what an excellent movie experience!  As usual, Tarantino puts as much into the music as he does the movie.  Waltz is his usual academy award winning self.  Tarantino continues with his unique camera angles and comedic outbreaks intermingled with extreme violence and historical spots.  My favorite is the KKK (well, preKKK since they were officially not called that during that time) scene with Don Johnson.  This is worth watching.  However, if you are interested in the more, sugar coated history like Gone with the Wind, then this is not your film.  Expect the bloody violence that Tarantino is known for.  Not only do I own the soundtrack, I look forward to buying this film when it is released next month.  Django is sure to become another Tarantino classic.
B00821OX98|4.0|Watched this on a whim not expecting much but for a &#34;Bug&#34; infested Sci Fi it was remarkably engaging episode after episode.
0761536434|5.0|If you grew up during the video game craze of the 70's and 80's this book is for you!  It's a great overview of how things really started during the Golden Age of Video Games.  From the start ups of Atari to Sega to Nintendo to even how pinball & coin operated machines greased the skids for consumer video games, just a great read overall.  There is probably a greater focus on the early companies like Atari, but the read on Nintendo and Sega were fascinating to me (as an Atari guy).  I would have like more photos, but the book was very easy to read and I found myself glued to it.  For me personally, it was a nice reintroduction to where video games are today.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|I didn't know Sting's music until I heard him with Andre Bocelli's CD.  This is a beautiful CD and I will definitely find other Sting CD's and check them out.  It's a cold winter day today, so I think I'll put it on now.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I really liked this book. It was exciting and adventuresome. Best of all, it was free. Yet, it was very short. Normally my books are at least 300 pages, but according to the kindle, it was only (about, I haven't memorized the number) 130 pages. I thought since it's become a movie and everything it might be a bit longer.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Never heard a bad Andre Bocelli.  I think I have every CD he has made.  I don't care if it is in English, or Italian I take a few on trips, and sing along with him as loud as I can, makes for a fast trip.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|The puzzles just keep coming and I can always find new ways to challenge myself by replaying a previous puzzle.  I can lose hours playing this game....
B003O86FMW|5.0|Beautifully written. Enough action to not want to put the book down until the last page is read. I'm excited for book three.
143351463X|5.0|This Bible, not yet considering its physical traits, is a wonderful treasure to me. At 28 and having grown up in the church, I for the first time have a thirst and desire for the Lord's Words. I've been led on a moving journey in my life through difficult times battling myself and others, out of the desert and to the place I am now, which is why I've purchased this great book. The articles and study notes are priceless to me for gaining a deeper understanding of the Bible. I can't wait to consume them all.<br /><br />The physical traits of the book are great, too, which helps me remember the value of what's inside. The TruTone color, feel, and structure feels good, and I love the stitching on the cover. I hope to make a leather book wrap for it to make it a little more robust for throwing in the car - I really want this to last me a lifetime, and I can be clumsy or cluttered sometimes. I know eventually I'll do something stupid to bang it up, tear it, or spill something, so I really want a replaceable cover. On its own though, its still a great book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for spiritual and product-quality reasons.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found a lot of great ideas and things to try!!!! Now only if i can stop pinning longing enough to actually try the stuff lol!!! U will love it!

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever you might think it's boring just because all you do is build things but once you get started you can't stop and the are two modes you can put it on if you just want to build you put it on creative mode but if you want mobs and animals to kill to survive you put it on Survival mode I have to say it's worth every cent.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A VERY STRANGE BOOK.  BUT ONCE YOU GET STARTED I COULD' PUT IT DOWN.<br />DID NOT SEE THE MOVIE, WAS TOLD IT WAS DIFFERENT THEN THE BOOK.  WOULD READ ANOTHER ONE LIKE THIS.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing. I have never read anything like it. I sat for hours reading this book. I couldn't stop. I admit, I was hoping for a fairytale kind of ending but I had to face that war<br />Doesn't end like a fairy tale. My favorite character was  definitely Peeta, because he was the one to cheer every up and say there's hope. But basically, this book is amazing, I just wish there was more.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game!  I make the rules round here!!! the game is really,really fun.I'll tell every one to try it and you'll never stop playing.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|U should let people play longer than usual people hate it when it takes so long and then u ,make them spend peanuts which is not cool because some families don't have that much money and their lucky to have the game then they want something really bad but they can't afford it THEY ARE POOR PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a well made series for sci-fi fans. I'm watching the second season now. Thanks to Amazon it's available for subscription streaming. I love subscription streaming. I don't have to have cable or satellite and I get to watch what I want when I want with zero commercials. I have Amazon Pime and  Netflix. Great deal.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I've read hundreds of books over the years and many of them I couldn't put down.  This one was not one of those.  I had to set my jaw and finish it because I can't stand starting something and not finishing it.<br /><br />The book started out slow, took a few exciting twists, got slow again, kept twisting, and then wouldn't stop with all of the twists and turns. The excitement stopped after the fourth turn of events and just became another excruciating chain of events that the reader just couldn't seem to get to the end of.  You would hope that the end of the book would at least give you some relief to help you feel like you hadn't spent those hours of reading in vain, but it did not.<br /><br />In summary, the book took a few chapters to gain momentum and then continued to lose the momentum with every twist and turn. By the end of the book, I was completely frustrated and glad it was over and I could move on to something I could get into and enjoy reading.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The book New Oxford American dictionary is a very good book for young people's It can help them in there spelling and as a teacher like me I will really need it for the children in my class so get a book read it used it  Will help u in the future
0920668372|2.0|I had not read this book before ordering it. The title led me to think it was for little ones(like my 2 year old grandchildren) so I was disappointed and felt that it really was for older children.  The delivery time and condition of the book were fine.

B009AP2G26|4.0|It's slipping a bit this year, I think. They are running out of plot points (not that plot has ever really mattered).  I like it more when they do older songs and show tunes.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Well written story. Makes me question the mind of the author and feel sorry for her husband. Disappointed in the ending.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Like The West Wing, this show is very well written week after week and the cast is truly great. I've admired Christine Baranski for years, Josh has been cool since Dead Poets, Julianna is Felicia and Archie P. is incredible.
B00003OSSL|4.0|This movie tends to get poor reviews. While it isn't necessarily Harrison Ford's best or most famous effort, there are a number of things to like about the movie. The concept of two people getting together after the death of one or both of their spouses in an accident isn't necessarily fresh and the idea of corruption in high places isn't either, but this movie has just enough romance and just enough action to keep your attention. It's not terribly memorable or original, but it's good enough to be entertaining.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game. Has excellent graphics and a totally amazing storyline to go along with it.  G5 puts out interesting hidden object.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|A nice timewaster to get you through boring car rides or just lulls in activity. Nice music, simple graphics and easy gameplay makes it great for all ages
B0083TXXZ4|2.0|My children love Nerf guns, but this one is pretty flimsy and keeps falling apart.  When it works it's pretty cool, but the quality of construction isn't as good as some of the other Nerf guns I've bought.  I would not recommend this particular Nerf gun.
B00466HM28|4.0|This is a fantastic product for the price and is capable of making great music. Unfortunately the pad sensitivity is poor. Takes quite a bit of effort to hit the pads which makes it hard to get the drums perfect.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a great game, but it lags terribly. It also produces many glitches. Overall, it is a fun game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is very addicting biz once u play u wanna play again it has alot of interest biz every month there is a new country or town also new things come up like people and snowboards
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoy all the features in it. We like to see how far we can excape from the Demon Gobling.  It bets Angry Birds by far and not so fustrating.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|There are several bugs I noticed.<br />-Helmets and hoods do not show on any character regardless of class. Some of them, like both of the genders in the Ranger class, already have a helmet stuck on them and no other helmets ever show up.<br />-There are some invisible and invincible enemies that spawn occasionally.They make it impossible to finish the level. The only reason I know that they existis that they show up on the off-screen-enemy-locater thing, and they block my arrows.<br />-Online mode does not work and it says that my username does not exist,even thoughit greets my gameloft live username every time I open the game<br /><br />Other than this the game is fun,but a little repetitive.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|This is a great film in the James Bond series. Daniel Craig is an awesome addition to the actors who've played this role.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|My son has read this book like 20 times. He loves that this has a few pictures drawn into the pages.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Awesome twists and turns in this book. I think it is a lot fast paced then her book gone girl which I think makes it a much quicker read. Loved it an  the broken heroine who really mad  the book.
B0063IH60K|1.0|It was a free app - but after every game there was an advertisement for singles - not for me.
B005HSL626|2.0|My son suggested I get this one because he enjoys playing it. I think i'm too old for this one.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|good ......  ............. .......... .......... ........... . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . ..-
B0063IH60K|5.0|I grew up playing this with real cards. I have played it on my computers and now my Kindle Fire. My husband only plays this game on our computer. It is a great game to play.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|The egg race and two years of hard labor prison camp for cutting the heads off three parking meters. Just amazing tail about cool hand luke.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I can pass the time with this one but it's not my first choice. The screens don't seem to draw my attention like other apps.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|This game is Amazing and the graphics are really good also people keep saying that there. Is not much missions well there wrong there's 23 missions and 27 jobs so there's a total of 50  mission (the jobs are like missions) yes it takes lots of space but this game is Amazing so it's worth buying and downloading It the only thing that I don't like is on some missions the game crashes but other than that this game is really good and also there is 10 racing mission I believe anyways I do recommend this game to everyone except children I would say the rating for this game is for mature only.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I had heard about this and once i got my Kindle Fire for Christmas i had my daughter load this for me. She then looked at her dad and said &#34;sorry dad&#34;. She knew i would find lots of things to make and idaes for the house that he could do as well. Love this site.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|The had me sitting on the edge of my chair. You never know what turn it is going to take on the next page.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is another great reliable game that has stayed at the top amongst all the others. I will always play this one. It is one of my top five.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best app I've downloaded so far! Great graphics! Fun to play. Only drawback is waiting for the energy to refill. My kids play this with me and they love it too! Perfect for horse lovers of all ages.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is fun to play. Makes me feel like a kid again and i am far from that age. I enjoy this one as somethign different to do and can be challenging.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun it takes some time but its all free and its easy to level up with out spending your own money. I recommend this game ;)
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I tried this game beause i read about it in a book I downloaded but I wasn't impreseed with it. It's not my type of game. I may have liked it better if there were more instructions on how the game worked.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|This is one of Beyonce's first live DVDs and I still think it is one of her best shows she has done in front of the camera. Great DVD.
B000JMKNV0|1.0|This was probably the worst book I ever read but I am not a very good reader as it takes me forever to finish a book so I am probably not a good person to review this type of book. I like simple plots that follow a straight course and I don't have to rack my brain to figure out what is going on.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This show was one of the great ones that have been on TV.  If you love the West Wing or never got a chance to watch all the seasons then I would recommend this buy.
B0085A9J18|4.0|The action starts from the opening title and doesn't slow down until the end. I got the unrated version, so I viewed many scenes through my fingers. Some of the special effects left me in awe wondering, &#34;How in the world did they do that?!&#34; I recommend it.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Ok, so the name of the movie turned me off when I saw it advertise.  Once I saw the trailer at the movie theater I thought “this might be good” but the I still wasn’t sold because of the title of the movie.  I ended up watching it at the movies and it was surprisingly a great movie. It has great action scenes and great photography.  I would recommend the buy.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I downloaded this due to all the Oscar buzz, and didn't really know what to expect.  Even after the first couple of chapters I was still thinking how unimpressed I was.  However as I continued reading I couldn't put it down, and at the last words I was praying for more!  If you're on the fence about downloading this, take the plunge - you won't regret it!
B0094K1K42|3.0|Darker than we thought it was going to be. Charlize was great but we do not believe the story was much to work with
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Not much to say because I LOVE Bruno Mars and this album is great. I was only going to buy three songs from the album but I got the whole thing because it was on sale and cheaper than iTunes. When I listen to it I loved the whole thing (that doesn't happen a lot with me).
B00BHMF578|5.0|We were on our tip toes the entire movie. The story, the Setting the Costumes...amazing. The story is not exactly how it happened in real life but gives a great deal of realism
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Outstanding performance by Mr. Jones. Good drama and interesting story line. Suspense keeps the facts from the viewers until the end.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|This was a present for my mom's birthday.  She loves NCIS LA and she started watching it that night, it did not matter that she had already seen the whole season.
B000ICM5MG|5.0|love this movie! great selection, and worth the price. always can rely on this site for anything i want and need
0395389496|5.0|The book was wonderful.  I will look at your other books when I am looking to buy another book. Thank you.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Full of heart stoppers, a good movie.  The plot is pretty good with lots of twists and turns in it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It works quick, easy and love that I can now pin on my tablet and phone. LOVE. By far my favorite app!
B004GYNPL2|4.0|Using the app so far with no issues. Password generation very convenient as you can set the requirements. Makes mesmerizing passwords less difficult and secures your accounts with different passwords. Using different passwords for each account is safer because if one account gets hacked then all other accounts are still safe. Will update review if anything comes up.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is better then temple run and is highly addictive. don't hesitate to download this game. perfect for the kindle.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|If you like jewel games then you will love this! Loads of levels, beautiful graphics, awesome sounds, and hours of jewel blasting fun. If you don't buy this app you are crazy!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read the book in one day, I could not put it down.  Saw the movie and it was good but as always the books are always better.
B005JE1JZC|5.0|I've only started reading Robin's books in the last couple of months but I have found them exciting and enthralling, this is my second set of books nearly done and find as soon as I finish one I can't wait to start the next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My entire family loves this game. In fact, we have it on all our devices. It takes a few runs to get it down, but after that, all is smooth surfing!
B006MPKDD6|4.0|A really great series. Well written and atmospheric. The characters are believable, flawed and therefore interesting. A good crime novel.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Film was exciting, possessed period  realism and had wonderful cinematography. Plot was adequate and the acting from principles was quite good. The Downey-Law hook-up is magic. Now if you're a mystery buff and seek a puzzle to be solved you may be disappointed. This version of Holmes is more action-oriented and less logical than say Jeremy Brett; although he still has a few scenes where he demonstrates his uncanny sense of intuition and empiricism. The difference in this Holmes may be the irony involved in the script. The audience knows ahead of time whodunit and the film is about Holmes just putting the pieces together. I recommend the film as great entertainment..
B006MPKD54|4.0|A really great series. Well written and atmospheric. The characters are believable, flawed and therefore interesting. A good crime novel.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I had wanted to see this when it was at the theater, so now I have my own copy.  I think Meryl Streep imitated Julia Childs so well.
B006MPK9SU|4.0|A really great series. Well written and atmospheric. The characters are believable, flawed and therefore interesting. A good crime novel.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Superb acting.  Great story and plot.  Good twist and turns to the show.  I can't get enough of it.  Bring season four on.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderfully written and acted, brilliant choice of actors, beautiful scenery.  As a lover of period pieces this one is spot on!  Cannot wait for next season. Thank you Amazon Prime for letting me catch up with the first two seasons.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The book started off slow but quickly captured me. A perfect story of the imperfections of life and love. Definitely recommended.
B0025KW29U|5.0|This pioneer mini-series designed for the online community encompasses everything we have come to expect from Director Joss Whedon.<br />With some big name actors (NPH and Nathan Fillion) , a story line that draws you in, and a musical score which easily warrants it's own place in your CD or MP3 collection, Dr. Horrible is a must have for any collection which is not strictly G rated!<br />The story arc has action, drama, and just the right amount of cheese blended in to keep it entertaining viewing after viewing.  This is definitely a show you will want to share with friends, and anyone else you find hasn't heard of or seen it!<br /><br />I'm normally not enthralled by most extras and commentaries included on DVDs and Blu-rays, but found many of those on this disc entertaining as well as engaging.

6305252572|5.0|48 Hours is one of Eddie Murphy's Top Ten best films.<br /><br />Nick and Eddie are a hilarious team. Nick plays the stern cop, while Eddie, 'prisoner on 48-hour leave,' cracks jokes throughout the movie.<br />Eddy's facial expressions are priceless, 'in all his movies.'<br /><br />Many laughs and action scenes.<br /><br />48-Hours was on TV last week, but between commercials and bleeps, I decided to buy the DVD.<br /><br />Amazon's Format description. 1-Star.<br /><br />As stated above, I was about to purchase 48 Hours, but first checked format, which read DVD.<br />While viewing Comments, someone mentioned the movie was Blu Ray, not Region 1, DVD.<br />I do not have nor want another player, including Blu Ray.<br /><br />Amazon should list the correct format. I hope an Amazon Employee reads this.<br /><br />The majority of my VHS and DVD's were purchased through Amazon, but if I cannot figure the correct format, 'because it's unlisted,' in the future my DVD's will be sought elsewhere.<br /><br />As far as the movie, 48 hours is an exceptional movie...a must have for Murphy fans.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Very happy that Amazon Prime offer this great movie at NO cost.  The action keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I love the Mission Impossible movies with Tom Cruise.  Action packed!
B006XOBFJC|3.0|I'm mystified by the rave reviews given this Ring cycle and can only offer my experienced opinion as an antidote. For a bargain Ring in good sound, this old standby fits the bill, but only just. The East German production made good use of prominent Wagnerian singers of the day - but there's the rub. Can the Ring succeed without a great Brunnhilde and Siegfried? That lack sank James Levine's Ring on DG, not to mention Haitink's on EMI. Here the situation is no better. Listeners will have to compare Behrens, Marton, and Altmeyer to decide how much compromise to make in a Brunnhilde. For me, Behrens was at least a major Brunnhilde on stage, and although she vocally lacked strength in her lower range, she's the winner of the group.<br /><br />Among Siegfrieds, the make-dos are Kollo, Jerusalem, and Goldberg, all inadequate and hard to choose among, although Goldberg is surely the worst. Kollo shouts and pushes his voice with unpleasant results, so the choice may be Jerusalem, a born Loge stretching himself and succeeding, insofar as he does, with artistry where his voice falls short. The other major consideration among the lead singers is Wotan, with James Morris far outstripping the veteran but dull Theo Adam, whose voice was never inspiring the way Morris's is, particularly at this stage in his career. Since both sang the role more than adequately, however, I doubt that a final choice rests with them.<br /><br />If your cast is insufficient, much can be made up with a great conductor. For me, the utilitarian Marek Janowski never rises above the competent and assured; he's not even a Sawallisch, and Sawallisch cannot be spoken of in the same breath as the great Wagnerian conductors from Furtwangler to Karajan. The argument that this set serves as a \\"good introduction\\" to Wagner strikes me as poor advice: great music always deserves a great performance, not a workaday one, no matter how skilled the singers are. Under Janowski, each lead singer delivers a more ordinary reading than under better conductors (e.g., Jessye Norman under Levine, Theo Adam under Bohm). Illustrious as they are, on this occasion the Staatskapelle Dresden too often are doing no more than going through the motions.<br /><br />Since the used market offers many choices for individual segments of the Ring, there's no need to settle for any single cycle - all are inconsistent. For dramatic thrust and energy, I'd pick the controversial Boulez cycle on Philips among the integral bargain sets, but its singers vary between inspired and inadequate - at least Gwyneth Jones turns Brunnhilde into a living dramatic heroine, as does Behrens, but the young Jones has more voice.Otherwise, it's away with Janowski, Levine, and Haitink. I'd also remove the clumsily conducted Ring from Barenboim, whose Brunnhilde and Siegfried are seriously overparted, but on VHS and DVD, the visuals of his productions give him an edge.<br /><br />For the individual segments of the Ring, if you want great singing and conducting in modern sound, my picks are Rheingold (Karajan or Solti), Walkure (Karajan or Leinsdorf), Siegfried (Keilberth or Solti, heavily weighted toward the former) and Gotterdammerung (Solti alone, standing tall after half a century).<br /><br />Here is Janowski's cast:<br /><br />Das Rheingold<br /><br />Theo Adam (Wotan), Yvonne Minton (Fricka), Peter Schreier (Loge), Christian Vogel (Mime), Siegmund Nimsgern (Alberich), Marita Napier (Freia), Eberhard B&uuml;chner (Froh), Karl-Heinz Stryczek (Donner), Ortrun Wenkel (Erda), Roland Bracht (Fasolt), Matti Salminen (Fafner), Lucia Popp (Woglinde), Uta Priew (Wellgunde), Hanna Schwarz (Flosshilde)<br /><br />Die Walk&uuml;re<br /><br />Siegfried Jerusalem (Siegmund), Jessye Norman (Sieglinde), Kurt Moll (Hunding), Jeannine Altmeyer (Br&uuml;nnhilde), Theo Adam (Wotan), Yvonne Minton (Fricka), Eva-Maria Bundschuh (Gerhilde), Cheryl Studer (Ortlinde), Ortrun Wenkel (Waltraute), Anne Gjevang (Schwertleite), Ruth Falcon (Helmwige),Christel Borchers (Siegrune), Kathleen Kuhlmann (Grimgerde), Uta Priew (Rossweise)<br /><br /> Siegfried<br /><br />Ren&eacute; Kollo (Siegfried), Peter Schreier (Mime), Theo Adam (Wanderer), Jeannine Altmeyer (Br&uuml;nnhilde), Siegmund Nimsgern (Alberich), Ortrun Wenkel (Erda), Matti Salminen (Fafner), Norma Sharp (Waldvogel)<br /><br /> G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung<br /><br />Jeannine Altmeyer (Br&uuml;nnhilde), Ren&eacute; Kollo (Siegfried), Matti Salminen (Hagen), Siegmund Nimsgern (Alberich), Hans G&uuml;nter N&ouml;cker (Gunther), Norma Sharp (Gutrune), Ortrun Wenkel (Waltraute), Lucia Popp (Woglinde), Uta Priew (Wellgunde), Hanna Schwarz (Flosshilde), Anne Gjevang (Erste Norn), Daphne Evangelatos (Zweite Norn), Ruth Falcon (Dritte Norn)<br /><br />Dresdner Staatskapelle, Staatsopernchor Dresden, Marek Janowskichers (Siegrune), Kathleen Kuhlmann (Grimgerde), Uta Priew (Rossweise)<br /><br /> Siegfried<br /><br />René Kollo (Siegfried), Peter Schreier (Mime), Theo Adam (Wanderer), Jeannine Altmeyer (Brünnhilde), Siegmund Nimsgern (Alberich), Ortrun Wenkel (Erda), Matti Salminen (Fafner), Norma Sharp (Waldvogel)<br /><br /> Götterdämmerung<br /><br />Jeannine Altmeyer (Brünnhilde), René Kollo (Siegfried), Matti Salminen (Hagen), Siegmund Nimsgern (Alberich), Hans Günter Nöcker (Gunther), Norma Sharp (Gutrune), Ortrun Wenkel (Waltraute), Lucia Popp (Woglinde), Uta Priew (Wellgunde), Hanna Schwarz (Flosshilde), Anne Gjevang (Erste Norn), Daphne Evangelatos (Zweite Norn), Ruth Falcon (Dritte Norn)<br /><br />Dresdner Staatskapelle, Staatsopernchor Dresden, Marek Janowski

0307950689|3.0|First, this novel has too many similarities with Da Vinci Code. A loner who is evil, but loyal to his cause. An old philanthropist. Rituals.<br /><br />But the climactic chapters are anti-climactic. The plot not quite as captivating.<br /><br />Some parts of the story have gravity. While others seem like deliberate fillers.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|a very well told, well made movie. beautifully made and handled considering the subject matter. it doesn't preach or take sides either, it's up for the viewer to decide.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I liked it a lot ...and it was OK I guess. CREAMy little sis loved it so I guess it would be VERY GOOD for little kids
1451696191|5.0|The format of this novel is killer - several letters written from one high school student to another.  Remember all of those \\"Dear Pen Pal\\" letters that Charlie Brown used to write?  Imagine that concept jacked up nine million times with a quiet intensity that holds on to you for the entire novel.  You will feel this story.  Read it.

Read this book.

The book is a quick read for how thorough it really is.  It's a small investment to make towards your future.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I was 15 the day Kennedy was shot and Stephen King's 11/22/63 time-travel rendition brought back the texture of the times in great detail.  Plus, it was a great story with vivid characters that pushed me to read the big tome in 3 days on my Kindle.  It was 20 years since my last dive into an SK novel so I was anxious to see if he had lost anything with time and effects from his roadside accident.  I'm happy to report that he is still the master of his genre.  The only criticism I have ever been able to find with SK are some little difficiencies in his science education (English majors!) that a few of his works display.  Time travel and its paradoxes are always messy and SK glosses with the best of them; as an example, I would have liked some reference to the Many Universes version or some other to show that he researched the physics angle as much as he researched the historical angles - it's just a personal thing with me.  I heartily recommend this novel when several days of escapism are needed.

B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was well worth the money and can not wait for the next one. Great graphics and story line. Only complaints would be to add more puzzles, and sometimes it was difficult to move from area to area because arrow was to close to a challenge area.<br />Otherwise a great game.
B0067EKY9K|2.0|I was looking for something more profound about middle eastern relations.  Instead I got a tepid british comedy.  Would not recommend.

B001NEK2GE|3.0|So I have owned this piece of gear for about 10 months now. With the recent update for setting it up, it's pretty good, especially if you like to personalize it. I've used it primarily for League of Legends and Guild Wars 2.<br /><br />So, it works well, when it's working. Often, I have to tab out of a game and then back in to get it to stop resetting to the original configuation. I have no idea how or why it does this, it's pretty random, but it happens a couple times a night.<br /><br />The key layout is comfortable (average size hands), but I don't like the difficulty of depression on a couple of the keys (g19 in particular). Bloody thing sometimes just doesn't want to depress.<br /><br />While I was excited about getting this originally, and I think it could be good for someone that wants to be able to use a small piece of gear nearby the mouse, instead of reaching across the desk, I'm basically back to the market looking for a solid gamer keyboard now. Ah well.<br /><br />Perfect for: Limited space, don't want to lay out a lot of money for a gamer keyboard, alternative layouts/gaming styles<br />OK/meh for: Keyboard functionality, having a \\"half keyboard\\" available<br />Lousy for: Knowing where your hand is (none of the keys are especially different, though there are 4 that have a *very* minor depression to approximate where Logitech thought the WASD should be).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season moves a little slower but still can't wait until Season 4.  Definitely would recommend.  I've watched it over and over again.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|We watch this movie...A LOT. Thank goodness it is also very entertaining for adults, too. I like this one way better than Cars 2.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Suspenseful and brilliantly written. I couldn't put the book down.  Just the kind of book I was looking for.  Read it.

B00936A0RU|5.0|Colorful characters brilliantly produced with an explosive plot, and rich history. I was thoroughly engaged with the three Bondurant brothers' journey.
B00422LESO|3.0|But nothing really to recommend unless you are looking for a nice, light fluffy read.  Three stars is about right.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|Doesn't work on Nabi 2. The controls won't work, I tried a restart and a reinstall. Still no good, waste of money for me.
0061992860|5.0|I ordered based on item description, picture of the item and other peoples ratings of item. I was not disappointed with item; it appears to contain lots of useful information and illustrations.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Most scrolling games get repetitive after a while but this one doesn't!! It gets more challenging as you go on but you can move on without completing all the goals. So you can still go back and try to get a better score later.  Really would like to have it for the computer!
B000JRYOPG|5.0|I had this on bootleg so when it came out on DVD I made sure I had me a copy. I recently sold my car which had an in dash dvd player in it and I left the DVD inside the DVD player.. AHHHHHH..... But AMAZON help me out by having this movie at a a great price and it came way before the delivery date..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for the rides up to des moines or if you are traveling a little ways. I love it because it doesnt have the same scenes all the time they change every once in a great while. I wd recemend it if you are someone wjo travels alot.
B003R50FRI|4.0|A magnificent true story set in Bombay and Afghanistan.  The writer 'Australia's Most Wanted Man' becomes a fugitive in Bombay after escaping from an Australian prison.  At various times he is a slum dweller,  where he establishes a free medical clinic for slum dwellers and then he is seduced into the Bombay Mafia.  Although a criminal he is blessed with an unusual integrity and loyalty towards people he likes and trusts.  Gregory Roberts writes brilliantly and takes his readers on this amazing trip with him.  My only criticism is that the story is too large for one book - both physically and mentally.  I would prefer it to be at least a trilogy so that parts could be absorbed before rushing off into the next round of experiences, adventures and shattering tragedies.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great Read! I truly loved this novel. It def kept you on your toes the entire time wanting you to read more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its so fun and so cool my friend love it to.  I love my horse 's becuas they love me!
B00271DNP4|5.0|I've read all the books twice and am now watching the movies twice.  Waiting for them to come out in a Dvd set. They are fun to watch multiple times because you always pick up something you missed or don't remember seeing.  Very good picture quality on my kindle.  Wellnworth it.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|Quick service as always. This was a Chirstmas gift for my daughter.  She is 21 years old and loves it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This free app (on kindle) is wonderful. I use it for daily forecast shown by the hour, 15 day forecast if we are traveling 50 miles for a concert in the next few weeks or 300 miles up north.  Also great to see what's forecast for an upcoming trip to Florida.  If there is a storm coming I can bring a map up on satallite and watch its progress.  Weather is constantly changing in Wisconsin and I don't have to wait for the TV news and weather.  I would pay for this as I use it every day.
0439023491|5.0|Quick service as always. This was a Chirstmas gift for my wife.  She wanted all of these books from Suzanne Collins and she loved it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Buy this book. It is a great account of the lives that our nation's true heroes lead and the sacrifices they make to make freedom possible for the average American!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|One of the best shows on TV today. Some how we missed the first season so we had to get it. Very interesting show, would not be good for younger kids but teens and up will like it.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|well this used to be a great app very useful but after i updated from version 6 to 7 i can't access any of my google docs which was what i primaraly used this app for. now it just says &quot;network error&quot; and that is the case on both of my devices. so i would say if you have version 6 stick with that. otherwise maybe look at something else until they fix this.

B004XQYBA2|5.0|The first free app of the day for March 2013 from Amazon.com happens to be Sudoku 10'000 Plus.<br /><br />I have written reviews for over 50 apps so far and I have never given a 5 star review before this since I wanted to make the 5 star reviews feel more important.<br /><br />The reason I am giving this a 5 star review today is because the developer of Project Downforce yesterday gave his app a 5 star review even though he admitted he was being biased, and I want to let him know that Sudoku 10'000 Plus is a REAL example of a 5 star app.<br /><br />What makes this a 5 star app?<br /><br />1.  It is full of features.  There are features for many things such as different fonts, different colors, etc.<br /><br />2.  It lacks a bunch of unnecessary ads.<br /><br />3.  It is not too large in size on your device.<br /><br />4.  It has a nice visual appearance.<br /><br />5.  It has several skill levels.<br /><br />6.  It has several variations of Sudoku that you can play.<br /><br />7.  It has enough puzzles to keep you entertained for many months.<br /><br />There are a few things I should point out though.  This is not a Sudoku game designed for kids and other newcomers, but it wasn't meant to be designed to be for kids and newcomers.  And I would have preferred the layout of the level and variation selection screens to have an image of that kind of puzzle next to them without having to select that variation first.  But because these issues are so minor, I am still giving this 5 stars.<br /><br />Now finally I want to mention why yesterday's free app Project Downforce was NOT a 5 star app.  It was not a 5 star app because it lacked numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 above.  The app maker did not really make his game in a way where the controls were flexible and where the skill levels could be adjusted for various level of game players.<br /><br />But I do appreciate the helpful insight to how the Project Downforce game is supposed to operate in his review.  I know it can be frustrating when you're an app publisher getting one or two star reviews, but the best thing you can do is to learn from the criticisms and make improvements to your future app projects and learn what makes apps like this one actually worthy of 5 stars.  Very few people go through life successful at every thing they make.

B003B02PF4|5.0|Once into the story you won't want to put it down.  Grisham once again holds the reader spellbound and wanting more.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is my favorite Miyazaki film so far.  It has l lot of creative and surprising elements.  Interesting fantastical characters. Clever story.  We enjoyed this very much.  My 8 year old loved it.  It really opened him to some thinking and imagination
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I am looking forward to seeing the rest of the shows.  Good show, glad I ran across it to begin with.
B003NWS5AO|3.0|I have another Robert Plant CD that is much more interesting.  This one just didn't touch me.  Its alright, but seems a little bland to me
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|This would be a good game for a small child perhaps. 2 to 4 years old.  A little slow for older kids.
B000065V42|4.0|Got this video for my 8 year old nephew.  We enjoyed it. Lots of fun circumstances.  Lots of stuff kids can relate to.  We had fun.
B000H4TX9I|4.0|I don't understand why this didn't make it to several seasons.  It was interesting premise. I enjoyed watching. Especially liked the lead actor.
B00AYL7OAY|5.0|If you are a fan of the band, you will not be disappointed.If you are new to the group you could start with this one or any of the older albums. They are very consistent.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So easy to take it and other books where ever you go and you can jump to chapter and verse so easy.
B009KNPNH8|5.0|There's no better guitarist or rock 'n roller than EC. The CD for the 35th aniv. had a blue label on it, but the LP vinyl didn't.
B002UXRH10|5.0|I think I listened to this CD over and over. She puts out great music.. love this CD as well as all her others.
B009D3CTVS|2.0|Looks like Roland released the 10.8 driver on 2012-07-26, but as of this writing, it hasn't been updated for Apple's latest incremental update (10.8.2). Thus, it doesn't show in the MIDI window of Audio/MIDI Setup. By the looks of their download page [...], it doesn't look like they update drivers at all for incremental updates. Back it goes :(
B0063IH60K|5.0|A GOOD WAY TO RELIEVE STRESS..... I RESORT TO THIS WHEN I NEED TO TAKE A REST FROM READING,  OR JUST CAN'T SLEEP.
B00BEQZK5Y|5.0|After downloading this from amazon.com first thing in the morning on the day of its release, and listening to it from beginning to end a few times already, I can now honestly say that, even though this album is indeed a bit different from their previous efforts, it still packs the tremendous punch for which Stratovarius have been known.<br /><br />The most obvious difference to the listener upon hearing this album from beginning to end is that Stratovarius are playing around with some mild electronic elements, varying in degree from song to song. Honestly, I DO NOT think for a second that this is a bad thing, as long as it is composed the right way, and Stratovarius prove that they know how to make it sound great along with the guitars and drums. Aside from that, the guitar solos are still as epically amazing as they have always been, and the new drummer more than holds his own with his debut with the band.<br /><br />Overall, this album, like just about everything else Stratovarius have done, is a first-rate masterpiece by a band of first-class musicians. Stratovarius are EASILY one of the best bands in the last 25 years, hands down. They NEVER stop making great music, and this album proves it. So please throw away all those Green Day, Weezer, Fall Out Boy, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit and NickelHACK CDs, and make a more proper investment in the mighty Stratovarius!<br /><br />Anyways, do yourself a favor and BUY THIS ALBUM!!! \m/\m/
B00A757EFW|3.0|I LOVE PAC-MAN.....I HAVE BEEN USING IT A LONG TIME. YOU NEED TO UPGRADE VERSION BECAUSE THIS LITE VERSION GETS A LITTLE BORING BECAUSE IT HAS NO LEVELS...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Loved this game... started on my I-phone and went through various levels, challenging but doable with some thought :) As it got more complex, eventually went to a kindle to make it easier to use the touchscreen. Even that was &#34;possible&#34; on the phone, but difficult. Enjoyed the ability to go back and &#34;perfect&#34; each puzzle or continue on as I chose. A bit addictive, but that's not the games fault... :)
B007IXWL2C|3.0|THIS FINAL BOOK WAS NOT AS GOOD AS BOOK 1 & 2.  I STARTED TO LOSE INTEREST. WHEN I WAS READING THE FIRST (2) BOOKS, I COULDN'T PUT IN DOWN. IT SEEMS BOOK 3, WAS TO ORDINARY....AND BORING. BOOK 3 WAS TOO DRAGGED OUT.<br /><br />I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE FIRST (2) BOOKS, BUT NOT THE FINAL TRILOGY. I JUST COULDN'T GET INTO IT. IT WAS TOO PREDICTABLE.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show!!!!!!!!!  One of the best character driven shows out there.  I will recommend it tp everyone I know!
B006T5GTK0|4.0|A Town Like Alice is the 1956 low-budget film adaptation of the 1950 novel of the same title by Nevil Shute. The screenplay generally follows the plot of the novel, although only the first half of the novel is included: Jean’s experiences in Australia and her life with Joe are absent from the film. Joe is very well played by Peter Finch; Virginia McKenna plays a rather older Jean than in the book, blonde, unable to speak Malay and rather more emotional. The setting is quite authentic, although some of the beauty is lost due to the film not being in colour, and in trying to portray sunburned skin in b&w it is difficult not to make the actors look simply dirty or made up. This film won the 1957 BAFTA Best British Actor, Best British Actress and was nominated for the Best British Screenplay, Best British Film and Best Film from any source. Definitely worth seeing.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Excellent quick read. Hard to put down. Finished in a weekend. Sadden me to think of the horrors of 1942.
B007L5GDGW|2.0|The game has beautiful graphics. However, there are no instructions informing you the tracks link together and no speed control for the ball.  There is no warning about which way to tilt to hit the next track so you have to memorize tracks as you go. Just tilt left and right fast enough to keep up with the ball and hope for the best. Frustration sets in after the first few minutes followed by an uninstall.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Looper I love it Bruce Willis Looper I love it I love it I love it I love it I love i
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This great book as really made a difference in our marriage. It has made it stronger. Recommend it for every couple.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book! Nicholas sparks never disappoints! Had me captivated, I could not put it down! I found myself reading every free second I had!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|best app ever lots of games very hard worth the effort. very enjoyable glad I down loaded this one. not a problem as some of them are.
B002RKSCA6|4.0|It's a little more than my vocabulary is used to handling but I enjoyed it very thoroughly despite my lacking. I recommend reading it
B0098460O4|5.0|If I hadn't seen them with my own eyes, I never would have believed they were teenagers.  The quality of their voices is way beyond their years.  I bought this a few days ago, and I have listened to it every night as I enjoy my evening. This is not a pop album, nor is it something you want to listen to if you are trying to rock the crowd.  This is very classy, very classic music. The music is beautiful, their voices are amazing, and their Latin is fabulous.  I will be buying more from them!
B004FOA84A|5.0|This was a new one for me; had never done one of these games before.  Really really fun.  Thanks for the game.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|This is the first album I have purchased of Susan's, but I did really enjoy it.  It has a wide range of songs and most of them stayed pretty true to their origins, which I liked.  I'm not a huge fan of when artists totally skew a song to try to make it something else.  Some of these were different from the original, but not so much that I wanted to gouge my eyes out.  She has a beautiful, classic, sweet-sounding voice.  Very professional, very clean.  I enjoyed it and will look for other things that she has done.
B003BWERF8|4.0|Works perfect with my Ipod however it does take the charge from my ipod more than I thought it would. I still use the device for my workouts and paired it with LG headsets. They work together perfect. I recommend for everyone who runs or is a gym rat<br /><br />***Pros****<br />Very small and light weight. Easy to pair.<br /><br />***Cons***<br />Battery drainage
B006M9NI48|4.0|The allusion to Quantum Physics is a quite a revelation, and a great discipline for life. If you get nothing else out of this book, you should find yourself improved in many ways. Recommended.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I was a little surprised to find out there was a story in this movie. It was better than I expected and I enjoyed the movie with my girl one night.
B006JDFLR4|3.0|There wasn't much more in this one - just a repeat of what's already been said. The same goes for the last one, The Magic.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Watch it, loved it, can't wait to see what happens next, Better than anything on TV. If the network would produce quality features like this, instead of the Reality, Crap they are now showing, television would be better off.
B008Q0CO0U|5.0|Loved the Helicopter Snow scene, a real nail biter.  Love the ending pure justice!  Mark Wahlberg rocks in this thriller.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I give this book a 5 stars I have read all of the books of this series and they just keep getting better
B00AREIAI8|4.0|wonderful game you have to get this app<br />the horses look amazing I cant think of a game which has more detail
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This app is really good! It is ideal for ebay sellers on the move. It is very user friendly and the alerts allow you to stay on top of your items.
0061978078|2.0|This book was very contrived.  The first one had a way better storyline.<br />I didn't get the point of going back and forth between the past and the present, other than a rather pathetic and unnecessary attempt to build suspense.  I thought that storytelling device was more annoying that anything, and there didn't even appear to be any kind of correlation between the parts to make the author's choice in this make sense.<br /><br />I also was never sure of just how much time had passed between the first book and the second (in the storyline).  Was this only six months after the first book's end or a year and a half or a little longer?  It would make a difference to me in the believability of the story.<br /><br />Additionally, I feel there is a lack of motivation for some of the other characters.  Warning, a bit of a spoiler here: Why would Tack and Raven help spring Julian at such risk to themselves when there didn't appear to be any close relationship between either of them and Lena or Julian?  Also, how stupid is Lena?  She really didn't have any idea that she was being setup?  And especially after the elaborate setup, why would Tack and Raven bother saving Julian if they are so cold and calculating?  Plus, considering how hard it was for Alex to free Lena, are we really supposed to believe that the son of the DFA could be sprung from a hospital/execution room without major injury or losing any members of the rescue team?<br /><br />I'll probably read the last one just because, but it'll definately be through a library because I'm not paying for the last book after the let down of this one.
