B00005NNMK|5.0|I don't necessarily own the Bonus tracks version of this album, but I do have the original. Just to clear up any confusion.<br />   I have to say that not only are the songs on this album great to listen to, but they also sound best when you actually turn the volume WAY up and let the Tempest roar. <br />   This may sound hard to believe, but this song has become something of a big motivational tool to me. Now, yes, I was born in the 80s, and some people would think that I'd be more into todays stuff. That is not the case, however, and when I look back at that decade, I had wished that I were alive back then. This album is probably the chief reason why. It had everything. Soaring vocals by Joey T., massive 6-string chops by John Norum, thundering bass by John Leven, hard-banging drum-tech by Ian Haugland, and ever-be-nimble fingrwork by Mic Michaeli. It is just such a pleasure to be able to listen to a song that truly defined a generation, and that was as big as the decade itself. It's just too bad that the North American audience never gave Europe that type of respect originally, though. Oh well. Still, this album, and the title track, will remain a HUGE 80s cornerstone of musical achievement forever. I STRONGLY urge anyone who wants to start an 80s collection, or those looking to expand upon existing collections, to give this disc a try. It might just turn into your personal 80s collection cornerstone. Well, that's all I have to say about that. I'm outta here. And remember Joey's immortal words;<br />                'Nothing is constant, except change.'
0345448898|5.0|The Dark Materials series is so much better than Harry Potter because it contains some reality in it and is more believable. There is a certain amount of Physics in it, telling you about the windows to other worlds and how they are formed also there is a lot of looks into religion and the heart of Christianity itself. The last book in the trilogy is based on 'Paradise Lost' and it re-tells the stories of angels. The two main characters are strong and different and are independent-not relying on their parents or anyone else but themselves.They have their daemons makes another story of friendship come up.  The story is breathtaking and exciting all the way through, with interesting friendships and a tale of love that is so pure and white that even the snow in the north is darker than it. A very intriguing and inventive series and quite magickal, a very worthwhile read and very much better than Harry Potter...
B00005RHGK|1.0|Do not watch this film!  Gina Philips's and Justin Long's acting abilities are absolutely abysmal.  My god, they ruined any chance at future careers by acting in this joke of a film.  Twenty minutes into this film, my girl friend and I could no longer tolerate the pounding headaches this film induced.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If you enjoy grand opera mixed with the Bohemian ideals of Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and, above all, Love, this is the movie for you.  Take the plots from most of the Italian operas of the 19th century, add montagues of pop music, a talented cast, stir, and you have a wonderful escape for two hours. Baz Luhrmann, of Strictly Ballroom fame, has again assembled an amazing cast for a fast and furious ride. Nicole Kidman is exquisite, Ewan McGregor is to-die-for. Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh are obviously having a grand time with their characters. The entire production radiates in the glow of the Moulin Rouge's electric lights.<br />If you are looking for reality or complete historical accuracy, look elsewhere. From the opening moments, we are notified that we're entering a non-real world. Sit back and enjoy. The look of the production is amazing, from the sets to the costumes. I don't know how the women were able to do those dances with real whale-bone corsets on.<br />The DVD offers a second disk of extra material, from interviews to unseen footage. Well worth the money for anyone who enjoys the movie.
6305907145|1.0|This bit of tripe is not even fit to line a birdcage.  The only reason I gave it one star is because there wasn't a selection for zero stars.  OK, it surely does not stay true to the Jane Austen novel; in and of itself, that is all right, since most novels are not adapted exactly according to the book.  This one, however, completely changes the dialog and personality of the main character (and other characters); it adds disturbing scenes of a sexual nature that are completely gratuitous; and the only relationship this movie has to the novel are the names of the characters, and possibly the setting.  Alessandro Nivola, I admit, is the definitive Henry Crawford, but even he is not worth watching this movie for.<br />Watch this &quot;adaptation&quot; at your own peril.
B00005OWIU|5.0|THIS SOUNDTRACK ROCKS! I just love Hedwig's theme. I defenatly recomend this for all people because the soundtrack has no words about Harry Potter.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day just keeps getting better. They may have traded the approval of their Berkeley peers for commercial success, but who needs approval, anyway? Green Day has been fearless in their approach to punk/pop, and unlike a lot of their contemporaries, they've managed to escape the limitations of &quot;punk.&quot;<br />Warning is their best album yet. It's got classic Green Day songs like &quot;Minority&quot; and &quot;Castaway,&quot; but the band continues to surprise with songs like &quot;Misery&quot; (a genre-bender like the faux-polka track &quot;King for a Day&quot; on Nimrod). &quot;Hold On&quot; and &quot;Jackass&quot; are great, fun, pop-y songs.<br />This album really shows the growth of the band, both musically and personally. The lyrics of &quot;Waiting&quot; and especially &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot; reflect the sweet ache of leaving youth behind and accepting that sometimes life doesn't turn out the way you think it will-- but that's not necessarily a bad thing.<br />Green Day's going to keep doing great things -- consider that a Warning.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I've been a Sade fan since her debut.  She's a refreshing change from pop and hard rock.  This CD is a must-have for Sade fans and for jazz, blues and R&amp;B lovers.  My favorite songs are Smooth Operator, Cherish the Day, Nothing Can Come Between Us, Your Love is King...I love the whole CD!  But my favorite is No Ordinary Love.  That song has so much soul...it just takes me away. <br />Do yourself a favor, get this CD.  You won't regret it!
0446608955|5.0|wow, this is one of the best books i've read recently, i'm addicted to love stories. lol. after seeing that the new movie coming out is based on a book, i decided i had to read it before seeing the movie, i'm a big fan of shane west. (he's HOTT) i absolutely love this story, and i cried a lot when i read it. now i can't wait for the movie to come out, and if it follows the story, it should be great!
B00000064E|4.0|I first heard River Man on the radio on a quiet Sunday and was so intrigued and enchanted, i had to stop what i was doing and listen intently to find out who this was. The sad sweeping strings, the light plaintive vocals and the lulling bossa nova guitar strum had me mesmerised. Buy this album, if only for this one song.
0375703861|4.0|Conversations rivaling Richard Russo's bar scenes (See The Risk Pool)... characters out of a John Irving novel... Just when you think the novel is settling in, she introduces the wacky intellectuals and all hell breaks loose.... and plenty of zinging humor. A pub with an Irish name, filled with Pakistanis! Great stuff.  Much of the political side is very timely.  Towards the end, the plot gets a little wild (aspiring to a movie?), but the well drawn characters save it.  Uneven, yes, but bright, insightful, entertaining, human.... Give us more, Zadie.
0446608955|5.0|I have read a lot of book and this one is one of my favorite.  It is a wonderful story that I think anybody would enjoy.
B000002UAI|3.0|Yes,thirty years ago or so, I certainly enjoyed this more than now. It looks like the old Beatles '65 and Beatles Six combined into a CD. But as always, there is some good stuff here done by guys in their early 20's, listened to today by a guy pushing 50. NO REPLY has always been my favorite rocker from the album,especially the refrain with the boys singing,&quot;If I were you I'd realize that I ...(etc)..&quot;  A sound only the Beatles could do and make it work. I'LL FOLLOW THE SUN is from the same Beatles '65, and is still a very fine harmonious ballad with equally good lyrics too. WORDS OF LOVE, an updated Buddy Holly tune, is beautifully done too, even if a little childish and simple. From the old Beatles 6 album, EVERY LITTLE THING and I DONT WANT TO SPOIL THE PARTY, both sung by John, and fine pop/rock ditties too. Generally, the rest,including updated Chuck Berry and some country/rock,etc. does not go beyond teenage rock, but still shows these guys having some great fun all around. Essential only after you've gotten the later releases...(It is fun reviewing and humming these old favorites again! ).
B00005ARDC|4.0|think Dandy Warhols crossed with a smokey, dank Lower East Side bar (i know, i know, they are from california but indulge me) crossed with a rusted out 1978 ford thunderbird.  get it?<br />The guitar is as thick as physically possible and the bass could not be any fuzzier.  <br />The record can be quite involving, but they have been  careful to not make it too overwhelming.<br />That said, a great record for when you need loud, loud noise  but also cool for the background
B000002UAF|4.0|the originals from 1964-65. This is a group of songs from 3 vinyls, but still a pretty good compilation, even if a little confusing to an old-timer! IF I FELL,and AND I LOVE HER were back to back 45's, and still hold up as among the best love songs for romantic young out there. HAPPY JUST TO DANCE WITH YOU is another of my old favorites, the whole effort just about perfect with a little Spanish flair thrown in, too. Same with THINGS WE SAID TODAY, only a slower melody. Both are from the old SOMETHING NEW (not HARD DAYS NIGHT)! aND I'LL BE BACK , a nice duet of a ballad from the original BEATLES 65. (Just to set the historic record straight, as another reviewer has done in a less direct way). The rockers here, like ANY TIME AT ALL are pretty good too,especially when they slow down a bit during the refrain. But for older fans, perhaps they don not wear as well over the years. Still, listening to this one plus HELP!, IT IS EASY EVEN TODAY TO SEE WHY THIS FOURSOME WAS SO SPECIAL, though the BeachBoys, during the same era, game them a fine challenge!!
6305268843|4.0|This is a well acted, quirky period piece with an unusual story line. Here, an English gentleman (Stephen Dillane) is looking for a weekend of fairly anonymous sex in hopes of fathering a child, as his invalid wife is not up to the task. An impoverished Swiss miss (Sophie Marceau) is desperate for money due to her family's circumstances. She passes muster during the initial interview with the English gentleman and is hired for the job of potential surrogate mother. Their nights of anonymous sex turn out to be a surprise for both of them, yet they part with the understanding that they will never again meet. Their union having proved fruitful, she ultimately gives birth to a child, their daughter, who is taken from her immediately after birth and given to the father, as contracted. For seven long years they are separated. They are then all brought together, causing upheaval and tumultuous changes in all their lives.<br /><br />This is a well acted drama with fine performances by the entire cast. The only wrong note is struck by the child who plays the seven year old daughter. She is simply odious and obnoxious, making the viewer itch to slap her. There is nothing that the child does that makes the viewer feel the child's desire for a mother. The other performers, however, more than make up for this one dimensional child actress. Moreover, the cinematography is quite beautiful, with stunning shots of a fairytale lake house. All in all, this is a film that those who love period pieces will enjoy.
0684800713|4.0|Over about the past 30 years, I have trekked thru just about all the Hemingway oevrue, including the usually panned posthumous works. Yes, there are some great moments here, especially the very last line, if you can get that far. The journeys thru Spain, the bullfights, the semi-deadened characters, some beautiful set pieces make this worthwhile, but in the end it becomes practicaly one drunken/eating escapade after the other.Sure the writing at times is beautiful. As someone else says here,and I agree, THE GREAT GATSBY is better written,more timeless, and about America then and now. As for 1920's expatriots in Paris, Hem's much later collection, A MOVABLE FEAST is, I think ,far superior,witty and amusing, and you can tell simply by the title, not desolate like this one. Still, SUN ALSO RISES has a lot to say,believable characters, and characterizations,despite the seemingly neverending alcoholic binges. It's just not the great writer's best.Perhaps that's to be expected, given that he wrote this at about age 26!!
B000001FOS|4.0|For the first time since Graham Bonnet, Yngwie permits significant collaboration with another singer and ex-Blackmore protege, Joe Lynn Turner. As the songwriting credits  pointedly indicate, Turner's contributions extend beyond the lyric department and his musical influence clearly pervades most tracks, especially on \\"Crystal Ball\\" and \\"Deja Vu.\\" (One is tempted to speculate that thus far in his career Yngwie habitually allocated more autonomy to Ritchie's partners, a privilege which he unfortunately did not avail to Jeff Scot Soto, arguably the finest vocalist to grace an Yngwie album) While the increased permeation of pop (courtesy of Turner) may be certain to pique devotee's of Yngwie's more gothic Scandinavian anthems like \\"I am a Viking\\" and \\"Mystic Mirror,\\" there is nonetheless an unmistakable Malmsteen imprint on this album manifested not only in the shred solos (as scorchingly fast as ever, a remarkable feat in light of Yngwie severely damaging his picking hand in a racing car accident a year before) but on numerous tracks as well, namely \\"Rising Force\\" and \\"Deja Vu.\\" Given its title, the former is quintessential Yngwie, which coincidentally he has noted in interviews as the first track that he wrote. \\"Dreaming\\" is one of Yngwie's most beautiful songs and unquestionably his greatest ballad since \\"Suffer Me.\\" Colored with haunting arpeggiated diminished seventh chords, \\"Dreaming\\" affirms that Yngwie's prodigious knowledge of baroque progressions can likewise produce an ethereal atmosphere not commonly featured in typical metal ballads as well as astonish with through dazzling technique. Finally, no review of this album would be complete without mention of the most famous track, \\"Heaven Tonight,\\" which to still day still stands as Yngwie's only top 40 hit in America. Granted this song reeks of AOR pop metal, yet its chorus is so infectiously catchy and its memorable verses and bridges admirably constructed that one has to concede that it is a well-crafted song. Surprisingly, this is perhaps the one Yngwie song with an unspectacular solo (by his standards), which neo-classical disciple Chris Impellitteri criticizes as \\"sloppy.\\" Nevertheless, thanks to the emphasis on structure and melody, \\"Heaven Tonight\\" ranks as one of the few Yngwie songs which effectively stands on its own without a solo. <BR>  Significantly, no goth metal purist is more dismissive of this album than Yngwie himself, who has extrapolated how even at the time of its release he was already disappointed with its musical direction. Although hindsight undoubtedly played a galvanic role in this reassessment, it is visibly clear from the concert video of Live in Leningrad that Yngwie is displeased with Turner's performance, particularly in the latter's rendition of the earlier gothic songs, whereby Yngwie often interjects quasi-Mark Boals screams during the choruses. Knowing that these shrill vocals were incompatible with Turner's cleaner, subdued, and straightforward singing style, Yngwie presumably attempted to supply the songs with a tougher edge, an endeavor which would be partially realized with the replacement of Turner for the more aggressive vocalist Goran Edman on the subsequent album Eclipse. While this stylistic incongruity is true with the concert, it is nowhere evident on Odyssey in which both Turner and Yngwie made a concerted effort to write songs which accommodated both of their approaches. The fact that these two disparate individuals managed to churn out a lyrical and un-labored album is a testament to the creativity of their fruitful yet predictably ephemeral collaboration. Overall, Odyssey deftly interweaves goth and pop metal brilliantly whereby it comes across as a different yet not by any means unimpressive Yngwie album. While it lacks the savage assault of Marching Out and the emotive histrionics of Trilogy, Odyssey is a landmark album from the Yngwie catalogue which is most enjoyable when appreciated not in contrast to its predecessors but on its own merit.
B000002UAC|3.0|Mr. Vrana, in his perceptive review, notes that this, and many other early Beatles CD releases, were often a mix of earlier 33's,and that really shows here. He's right that it seems Capitol should have two-fers,as has been done with the early BeachBoys,also on Capitol. Maybe Capitol will do it in the future,as another way to make some $$$ from this #1 all-time rock band (with the BeachBoys breathing down their neck in the race!). Anyway, it's obvious that with all their exuberant fun and vitality, much of their early stuff does not really hold up that well over the years, beyond the youth market,which today has other things of their own. (Although I doubt if anything really matches the TOP TWO Capitol 60's bands). These tunes,from MEET THE BEATLES and THE BEATLES SECOND ALBUM include a lot of early 1960's tunes that they did not write, and it shows. MISTER POSTMAN, DEVIL IN HER HEART, ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN, and MONEY (simply a bad song) were all done by earlier performers. TILL THERE WAS YOU is an interesting, and fine, version of a Broadway Standard covered by the Fab Four, one of only two, the other being A TASTE OF HONEY(originally on INTRODUCING THE BEATLES on VEEJAY records). Both were sung by Paul, who was interested in such non-rock tunes at the very beginning, as he has stated in numerous interviews. (John did not seem to agree.) But frankly,most of the originals here are not top Beatles except ALL MY LOVING,  a big single hit too. IT WONT BE LONG was another &quot;yEH..yEH&quot; type, fun at first listening. I WANNA BE YOUR MAN  was written for the Rollingstones, and sounds like it.George's first effort, DONT BOTHER ME, is nice,if not his best. The rest are good enough, but not among their many &quot;don't miss&quot; classics.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I saw this movie because a friend strongly recommended it.  From the description, I didn't expect to like it and wasn't planning to watch it all the way through.  But I hadn't even watched the first minute by the time I was completely hooked.  The movie draws you in and keeps you going right up to the end.  I'm not a rock fan, but the music was AWESOME.  Beautiful art, great cinematography, powerful acting, and a deeply touching storyline.

B00005QZWI|5.0|I'll keep this simple.  I too had qualms knowing Howard Shore was writing the score for these movies.  I had low expectations because I am only familiar with his music for Seven and The Game.  In the end, choosing Shore to compose the 'Rings' scores was a great move, not only did he write a magnificent score, but it doesn't seem to borrow from other film scores like Horner's or Williams's sometimes do.<BR>I will dispute Kevin Soh's (his review is further down) claim that the score has no main themes to built upon.  On the contrary, it has at least three themes that are prominent throughout the score that I can easily see appearing in the next two movies.  The Hobbit's theme is first established in &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; and is heard quite often throughout the rest of the score.  Aragorn's theme, (well I'm just choosing to call it his, I don't know the proper name for it) can be heard at the end of &quot;The Ring Goes South&quot; and beginning &quot;The Bridge at Khazad Dum.&quot;  The ringwraith theme is in tracks 5-8.  All three of these themes, as I said before, I can see being developed in the next two scores, for which I am greatly looking forward to.
0586045449|5.0|The best fictional account of the \\"Other Side's\\" (German) view of being the \\"attacked\\". Mr. Deighton obviously has done his homework in showing how one massive,confused attack on a German town in the Summer of 1943 devastates everyone involved from the British RAF planners and pilots, politicians, and even more the German civilian home front, not to mention just about everyone else on the German side,from the SS,Luftwaffe, to the totally innocent on the ground. When the air raid alarms go off in the ficticious German town to the inevitable,terrifying end, mistakes and all, you know you're reading from a master. The ending is as terrible as you can imagine...
6302859204|5.0|This is by far the freakiest movie that I have ever seen.  I know it differs from the book, but when you see those alien faces they burn themselves in your mind and you hope you never come across anything like that in your life! I was up for days after watching this movie.
B000002UA9|3.0|That is the US MEET THE BEATLES, BEATLES SECOND ALBUM,AND INTRODUCING THE BEATLES. An odd mix for someone used to the originals. Having been familiar with all these for a very long time, and having memorized them all on the guitar, you can surely hear the originality even today, even if some of the cuts don't seem that much better than your solid high school prom band  then,(or now probably). There are some standouts,mainly PLEASE PLEASE ME, with their famous echoing vocals and &quot;Oh yeahs&quot; still as fresh as the morning sunrise (okay, maybe that's an exaggeration). I always thought Paul sounded like Elvis on PS I LOVE YOU, a better song than the old standard of the same name done by many others, including Sinatra! Again the echoing vocals like in some Elvis things. THERES A PLACE another fresh sound, never getting old. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW A SECRET, again with the echoing vocals! The rest are mainly forgettable, or retreads of others' &quot;hits&quot; . (I never could listen to &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; without getting at least a slight headache). Paul gives the &quot;adult contemorary&quot; hit TASTE OF HONEY  a unique flavor. (Remember the famous speeded-up instrumental version by Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass?!) Three stars is enough for this fine,early effort!
0871137380|5.0|If the movie is as half as good as the book, then I think &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; will win the Academy Award for best picture.<br />Since 9/11 America has found new heros to believe in, Bowden's book gives us that!
B00005U2LM|5.0|I will agree that this album is different than the Wu's previous releases, but I don't see how it could be described as anything less than triumphant.  The instrumentals reflect the Clan whose members are aging slightly and bring a sort sophisticated style to the beats.  Any fan of Ghostface's Supreme Clientele won't be able to get enough of the tunes.  The lyrics are classic especially those addressed to the Taliban.  The Iron flag is a untouchable addition to the Wu library.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Don't listen to the people who praise this movie. They obviously want you to think they are understanding something about it that you don't. There's nothing to understand except a big budget was wasted on a confusing, incoherent, and very maddening collection of scenes. It's like taking five or six pails of different colored paint, throwing them against a wall and trying to pass it off as &quot;art&quot;. There will always be a bunch of sheep who claim the result is a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, &quot;genius&quot;. Please! I'm surprised my DVD player didn't just automatically eject it after an hour in a gagging, convulsive fit of disgust. If I had watched this in a theatre, I would have demanded my money back.
6304698690|5.0|This is a film that will appeal to children of all ages. A definite MUST, and this is no exaggeration. Secrets and hidden passages abound in Misselthwaite Manor, where orphaned Mary Lennox is to live after coming from India (her parents were killed in a great Indian earthquake which happened a few months earlier in the storyline.) Adding to the depth of the story is an almost absent uncle who lives in the shadow of a tragic past. There is also her sickly cousin of a brat, who just can't stand the sunlight and fresh air. Put in too, impatient Mrs. Medlock, who is your &quot;perfect&quot; housekeeper. And top these with The Secret Garden, a sanctuary where the story finds its turning point from dark and despair to one of life, healing and hope. It is a place where things begin, and not without the efforts of the children, to grow.<br />There are moral lessons to boot all throughout the story. And for sure, the photography deserves praise. Suberb! Overall a perfect film that deserves a place in a collection. Frances Hodgson Burnett would not have been ashamed to see this film version of her classic novel were she alive today. Don't miss out on this one.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I didn't really think I'd like this movie but I was wrong.  I absolutely loved it.  I rented it and then as soon as I finished watching it I went out and bought it.  I loved the music, the costumes, and the story.  The acting was really great also.  I've lost count of how many times I've watched it.
6305531374|5.0|This movie is the best sequel of HALLOWEEN,has a great story but forgets a little the previous ones,is super cool that the new generations enjoy an anniversary like this movie,what was made before some of us be born,this is one of my favorite movies The DVD has a very clear image but the only problem is the widescreen Letterbox aspect,we need a widescreen anamorphic edition to enjoy more this great movie,the audio Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround is excellent the sounds are separated excellently. The previous edition of this DVD indicate in the packing an audio comentary that is not including but in the recent edition this mistake doesn't appears. I think that there's a special edition with DTS,but I'm not so sure if this is true.<br />All i can say is: Jamie Lee Curtis makes a triumphal return!!!.

B000002J0B|4.0|At the release of &quot;Houses of the Holy,&quot; Zeppelin was the biggest band in the world, riding off the success of &quot;IV.&quot;  &quot;IV&quot; being probably their best album, with &quot;Houses&quot; being second.  This was much more experimental, though, with by far some of their best work.  <br />Jimmy Page continued using strange guitar tunings that he had started on &quot;III.&quot;  And, now more than ever, Page's guitar work and Plant's patented vocals were complimenting each other, creating a swirling effect.  The band also starting using John Paul Jones on the organ/synthesizer for an effect that hadn't materialized previously.  The result was an album construed during the climax of Led Zeppelin's career.  The songs (out of 10)...<br />1.&quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; (10/10) - Perhaps the most fitting and anthematic opener in the history of the LP.  Absolutely classic.  2.&quot;The Rain Song&quot; (10/10) - rarely will you find a song that starts off this well.  A Page masterpiece in Gsus2 open-tuning.  3.&quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; (8/10) - One of the two big singles from the album.  Not as good as the first two, but still classic Zeppelin.  4.&quot;The Crunge&quot; (5/10) - Decent song, but not great.  Pretty funny, though; &quot;where's that confounded bridge?&quot;  5.&quot;Dancing Days&quot; (7/10) - Good song.  6.&quot;D'yer Mak'er&quot; (7/10) - the other big single.  One of Zeppelin's catchiest and radio-friendly tunes.  A little cheesy, though.  7.&quot;No Quarter&quot; (9/10) - Another huge Zepp classic.  Still gives me chills.  Outstanding.  8.&quot;The Ocean&quot; (7/10) - Zepp made some serious music, but every once in a while, they had some fun too.  This is one of the best &quot;fun&quot; Zepp tunes.<br />Overall, the album is an easy 9/10, and like the title says, one of the greatest albums of all-time.  Barely misses the 5 star mark for some of the &quot;little things;&quot; some songs that are good but not greatmainly.  But for those who own the album know that &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; gets no time to collect dust.  Highly recommended.
B00003CXS4|4.0|The general haplessness and incompetence of the various criminal elements and their grandiose schemes and their confounding in this film put me strongly in mind of Donald Westlake's novels of thief Dortmunder and his buddies (&quot;Bank Shot&quot;, &quot;Don't Ask&quot;).  Not the movies made from them, which have never quite displayed this level of precision and deftness, but the books themselves.<br />This is the type of film that can look so easy to just sort of toss off, but is actually quite difficult as one works to get the different story elements to work out at the right times to mesh to convey the story.<br />Vinnie Jones, as has been mentioned quite a bit, is a treasure; his &quot;replica/Desert Eagle&quot; scene, a sort of &quot;elder statesman of mayhem&quot; monolog, is one of the better menace bits i've seen in a while, as well as a helpful lecture on the basic mechanics of their chosen profession to a couple of junior thugs.<br />Dennis Farina and Brad Pitt, presumably chosen to give &quot;Snatch&quot; a bit more USAn appeal than &quot;Lock Stock etc&quot;'s all UKan cast, fit in nicely with the home-grown thugs; and, of course, Pitt's total incomprehensibility to everyone (Thank the DVD Deities for the special &quot;Pikey&quot; subtitles) is used to the fullest effect.<br />The mayhem herein is a bit less random and coincidental than was the case in &quot;Lock Stock etc&quot;, in that almost everyone has a Plan revolving either around illegal boxing matches or the 86-carat diamond or both. Some of them are quite Clever Plans.  The various story lines are a bit better explicated and easier to follow, as well.<br />Unfortunately for these fellows, it is a military truism that even the best battle plan seldom survives first contact with the enemy.<br />Impressively, unlike &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, which got so complicated that even the author of the original book was unable to figure out who killed the chauffeur, all is resolved by the end of the film, and we know what happened to whom.<br />OTOH, the end of the film also indicates a continuation of the screwball action..., and we know what happened to whom.<br />OTOH, the end of the film also indicates a continuation of the screwball action...
B000002LOE|3.0|I saw an old 1991 Rolling Stone magazine a couple of months ago with REM on the cover that said &quot;The biggest band in America.&quot;  I thought of how odd it was that REM, one of the greatest bands in history, were at the pinnacle of their popularity during this, a CD that is outshined by so many four and even five star albums.  Obviously every one is entitled to his or her opinion.  But for me, a pretty diehard fan, I rarely reach for &quot;Out of Time.&quot;<br />It has some really great music enclosed, but the new-found pop overtones can get a little cheesy or sappy.  Mind you, I speak of the music and not the lyrics.  Micheal Stipe is one of the most poetically-inclined frontmen ever, and he is never at a loss for words.  But this and &quot;Document&quot; contain songs that seem too eager for radio-friendliness that they don't stop to realize themselves.<br />&quot;Radio Song,&quot; &quot;Losing my Religion,&quot; and &quot;Near Wild Heaven&quot; are all four star songs; simply great.  I can even swallow &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; despite its cheesiness.  (The band has noted &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; as their most embarassing musical moment).  &quot;Endgame&quot; is a great little instrumental.  &quot;Low&quot; is good too, although I still find it hard to believe that they released it as a single.  But, the second half contains either decent songs or dull songs, nothing really outstanding to me.  And the album as a whole is near the bottom of my &quot;favorite REM&quot; list.  Simply, I liked the indie-rock from their vintage years and this has none of those qualities.  And in later albums they found a way to mix pop, alternative, and something very unique and personable that was all their own.  You, however may like &quot;Out of Time&quot; more than I do.  6 out of 10...
B0000024RQ|4.0|Although this album doesn't have some of Dylan's best songs, it's well worth buying.  Any Dylan fan will appreciate listening to his first recordings, some of them classics.
B000002J1U|4.0|I would have to say that &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; is by far their most under-appreciated album to date.  Many fans hardly recognize it for the beautiful music it contains.  Sure, it's not as catchy, driving, grabbing as some of the more popular Zepp albums, but really that's the basis of its appeal.  &quot;III&quot; is not something you can imagine filled football stadiums moshing to.  It's  what's in the background as you ask someone to pass the coffee on a Sunday.  And critics, as many as their fans did at the same time, sold them out in the early 1970's.  Zepp is heralded as a &quot;Blues Metal Band&quot; (sounds like an oxymoron to me) and people expected the same high pitched wisping Robert Plant vocals to accompany Page's blues riffs.  But when &quot;III&quot; hit, everyone was disillusioned.  Teased with &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; and Part 2 of Friends, &quot;Celebration Day,&quot;  no one could lower their heart rate in time to appreciate acoustic classics like &quot;Tangerine,&quot; &quot;Gallows Pole,&quot; and &quot;That's the Way.&quot;  Perhaps they could swallow the bluesy &quot;Since I've been Loving You&quot; or &quot;Hats Off to Roy Harper&quot; having been introduced to the same sound in their 1969 debut, but on the whole they were disappointed.  <br />Years later &quot;Immigrant Song,&quot; &quot;Friends,&quot; &quot;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp,&quot; and the unreleased &quot;Hey, Hey What Can I Do&quot; rank among Zeppelin's greatest songs.  Page seemed to be the one taking all the risks, hanging up the legendary Les Paul to fiddle with alternate acoustic guitar tunnings (Open D 4th fret capo on &quot;That's the Way,&quot; Open G tuning on &quot;Bron-Y-Aur&quot;).  And after the dust has settled on the bands monster career, &quot;III&quot; is behind only &quot;IV,&quot; &quot;Houses of the Holy,&quot; and &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; as Zepp's finest album.
0061040967|5.0|A fun read.  While I'm a big fan of the other Discworld books, I enjoyed this one more than most just because of the originality of the format.  The illustrations are well drawn and add an immense amount of enjoyment to the reading of this story.<br />Glad to see Terry Pratchett trying new things with his wonderful series.
B000002JSR|3.0|The entire world was shocked to hear about John Bonham's alcohol-related death.  The rest of Led Zeppelin said that they knew they were done instantly after it happened; they refused to find a new drummer.  But the band was kind enough to put out some unreleased material shortly after the tragic incident.<br />Of course, they knew as we know now, that it wouldn't be a classic... or excellent... or even good... it's decent.  A five star album out of ten, which isn't terrible; there's some good music and I'm glad I have the album.  &quot;Poor Tom&quot; is a great song.  Same with Bonham's drumming on &quot;Bonzo's Montreaux.&quot;  The other six songs are okay, but nothing really essential.  But that wasn't the purpose for &quot;Coda's&quot; extrication.  It's to let fans have a little bit of dessert after the full-blown meal of IV's, II's, Houses of the Holies, and Physical Graffities.  Thank you boys.
B000000OUE|2.0|&quot;La Sexorcisto&quot; was a great album.  It was heavy, it was orignal, it was just perfect.  Naturally, I couldn't wait to buy a new White Zombie album.  Then I got...this.<br />I cannot believe this is even the same band.  The killer riffs and bluesy solos have been replaced by a wall of distorted noise, and Rob's awesome growl has been reduced to this sort of pained moaning, that sounds kinda like a sick dog.  &quot;Electric Head Part 1&quot;, is a pretty good song, and &quot;Supercharger Heaven&quot; is okay-ish, but that's about it, I'm afraid.  I mean, this is really a step down.  Compare those catchy, head bangin' riffs from &quot;Thunderkiss&quot; or &quot;Soulcrusher&quot; to the overblown distortion of &quot;More Human than Human&quot;.  It's not even the same band, no way!  The only thing this album may have on the debut is the drumming, because John Tempesta was in Testament, so he's probably a slightly better drummer than Ivan, but that just ain't good enough.  This is just horrible.  Worse yet, Rob sank even lower than this with his solo career.  His new song sounds like frickin' Wang Chung or something!  If you like good music, don't buy this.  I guess something snapped in Rob's brain or something.  Oh well.
B00003CX5P|3.0|George Lucas hadn't made a Star Wars film in over 15 years as he was busy running his empire (and being a single dad.) While the film felt uneven in a number of places, The Phanton Menace reminds you of why the Star Wars fims were so popular in the first place: loveable, memorable characters, unprecedented special effects and storylines that left you with a sense of wonder that appealed to the inner-child and philosopher in all of us. And you've got to admit--who else but George Lucas could have the world salivating and panting for more like a depraved drug addict while awaiting the arrival of a movie?!
B00005RHGK|1.0|This movie was absolutely terrible.  The main characters in most horror movies are dumb, but these characters' stupidity is way beyond that, to the point that you will be [mad] through the whole movie, hoping that they'll just die soon and get it over with.  This movie was definately a waste of 90 minutes.
0395489326|3.0|Acknowledging Tolkien's brilliance as a writer (he writes very, very well) and linguist (innovative) and accepting that a truly great imaginative mind wrote this book, I found _The Lord of the Rings_ to be a turgid trudge of a read.  Thoroughly and utterly disappointing.<br />It's interesting for the first 700 pages.  Thereafter I couldn't wait for it to finally end.<br />I completely lost interest in _The Return of the King_ -- the first two books of the trilogy were moderately interesting.<br />A good cure for insomnia, makes a very good door-stop.  I hope the movie is better than the book.
B00005JKQX|1.0|The character of John Nash had no redeeming qualities -- he had no social skills, was crude, and didn't seem to do anything (didn't go to classes as a student or teacher).  The whole tone of the movie was depressing.  I don't know where they got the title &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; -- nothing was beautiful about the movie or the character.<br />I walked out of the movie because I didn't see how any ending could make this movie &quot;beautiful&quot;!
B00005RHGK|1.0|I don't understand anybody liking or being scared by this movie!  I'll say this: The first 10 minutes looked like the movie was going to be scarier than &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;.....I was psyched.  Then the movie went downhill, and became just plain stupid.<br />You know you have watched a bad movie when it ends so abruptly that you sit shaking your head in disbelief as you watch the credits roll.
6302293553|5.0|There are been a lot of clever flims out there.  Films to make you laugh, films well written, well acted, well edited, with great special effects and all star casts...<br />...but lets forget about them and talk about Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  There are simply not enough adjatives to adaquately describe this film.  It is thinking humor, it is slapstick humor, it is political humor, it is irrevant humor, it parodies Arthurian Legends (with a jab at ancient greece as well) documentaries, spectacles, and itself all in one package.  <br />     It does all of this on a shoestring budget and a cast basically consisting of the six pythons, and a few extras thrown on here and there for speciality scenes.<br />     This movie isn't so much watched as experienced.  For maximum viewing pleasure don't let anyone tell you about the film.  Let them sit you down, turn on the VCR and be amazed.<br />     Like A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM you will miss funny things if you don't watch it multiple times; Unlike FORUM it is not due to editing but do to little backround things that are easy to miss.  I think three viewings minimum are necessary to catch all of the backround stuff.  Of course if you are not Leonard Malton then you will watch this movie three times out of sheer pleasure.  If you haven't bought it yet, shame on you! Don't you know that people are starving in the BBC residuals department!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|It seems that as human beings, we are concerned with an image that we try to uphold and/or a lifestyle that we wish to live out.  However, by some philosophical measures, happiness is an acrasia that is never truly obtainable.  After all, death is the only guarantee from life.  So what is this movie about?  To numerous people in the world who find themselves easily entertained by shallow and face value explanations, it's simply about drugs, addiction and the pain the characters go through.  But to those so very few fortunate movie viewers like myself (and I hope you are one as well) you will understand the movie at so many levels that you can sympathize with the characters for what they have been cursed with: being human.  But this is reality folks.  And the performances by Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Waynes and Jennifer Connelly make it that much more realistic.  The direction and choice in cinemetography of Darren Aronofsky is undoubtbly higher than the accepted, cliche norm, allowing one to connect and view the movie as an individual; something that is increasingly becoming more and more difficult these days to be.  And if you don't see this movie, at least do yourself the favor and read the book that it's based off of by Hubert Selby Jr.
B000050XEI|5.0|I believe that this is my favorite Enya cd ever.  I have been a fan of her music for years and put her music on to satisfy any mood.  A Day Without Rain is quintessential Enya--will delight loyal fans and will no doubt garner new ones as well.
B000002UKS|5.0|Maybe once in a lifetime a CD changes your life, straightens you out, messes you up, and points you in all new directions.  This is that CD for me.  EVERY SINGLE SONG is a gem.  To wit:  The odd, Beatlesesque pop of \\"Doll\\" and \\"See You.\\"  The crunching assault of the rockers \\"My Hero,\\" \\"Hey, Johnny Park,\\" and \\"Wind Up.\\"  The Pixies-inspired loud/soft explosions of \\"My Poor Brain,\\" \\"New Way Home,\\" \\"Enough Space\\" and the delightful \\"Up In Arms.\\"  The haunting, softer beauty of the ballads \\"Walking After You,\\" and the jaw-droppingly gorgeous \\"February Stars.\\" And best of all, the get your ... up \\"Monkey Wrench,\\" culminating in the most triumphant climax in rock history--\\"One last thing before I quit...!, and \\"Everlong,\\" the most hauntingly beautiful rock song ever recorded.  This is ROCK AND ROLL music as it should be, achingly emotional, personal, confessional, utterly devoid of pretension, posing, and turntables.  Soaring guitars, pounding bass, assaultive drumming.  Dave Grohl is a genius songwriter, and this is his finest hour.  No one has made a finer transition from behind the drum kit.  Colour and the Shape is his masterpiece, easily competing with anything in the admittedly exceptional Nirvana catalog.  Long may he rain, if the Foos come to your town, see their explosive show, and if you value truly good things, pick up this cathartic CD.  It just may change your life.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Ok, i wrote a review 4 this a few months ago with all the hype and i gave the cd 5,<BR>While the cd has gotten no worse, i just feel that i am more acceptant of the flaws in it now than i was at first. It rocks in the sense that it has some great tracks, bombastic love, and overprotected bein the best examples, yet it has fillers, and is not perfect. I would still get it, but dont expect the best cd ever, just expect a few good tunes, a few great ones, and a few that could have done with remainin in the studio! Still 1 hot album
0441172717|1.0|All the five star reviews make me wonder who really is writing in for these reviews.  As a Sci-fi fanatic, I was disappointed in this book for a few reasons, the biggest being the boredom aspect.  On page 229, I had to put the book down because I had no real desire to read on.  The other bothersome aspect is that this book does not take you in on the same emotional level as a &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; You really pull for Tolkien's characters, whereas Dune folk felt like automatons going through another Matrix-lite plot.
6305428425|5.0|Remember the 80's?  Well, it's back.  This movie makes me laugh all the way through and it has great music.  Helps me get over my urges to &quot;get back&quot; at those who put me down in high school! LOL
B00002E224|5.0|I can turn off the video portion and just listen to the dialogue and still understand the heart of the movie, which I loved.  The beautiful Vienna scenary and facial expression only add to the movie's soul - the brilliant dialogue.<br />This movie comes as a complete shock to me - the degree to how much I loved it.  You see, I don't buy many romatic/tear-jerker/silly/girly movies.  I'm more of a Action (Arnold/StarWars/Matrix) and soft-core porn man.  Indeed, I was scaning for the soft-core stuff when this came up.  Three things made me buy it:  (1) Ethan Hawke - I like his style of acting (Gattica, Great Expectations) - no I'm not gay; (2) Great reviews; and (3) Cheap as hell DVD.<br />Still, I put off watching it.  Only months later - last night - did I see it.  INCREDIBLE, BRILLIANT, BEAUTIFUL - about describes it.  (Maybe add in TRAGIC - for I have never experience THAT in real life, yet).  <br />I loved so many things in the movie, but I fell most for (Oh, jeez, I must confess) the likes of the \\"milkshake\\" poet, phone thing, snap shot ending, etc.  A lot of the little scenes that complete the movie.<br />This movie makes my TOP 10, along side Star Wars, Matrix and Braveheart.  The only other romantic movie that even comes close is \\"FALL\\" (about a cab-driver poet) and Twice-Upon a Yesterday (Penelope Cruz).<br />Any girls that look like Juile Delpy wanna meet me in Vienna in six months on platform 9?  Email me at ....  Or hell, we can make a new movie in NYC!
B00004RFCM|5.0|I only buy DVDs I can watch over and over and these episodes are definitely shows I can watch over and over.  I'm a newcomer to Sex and the City so to see the whole development of the &quot;Big&quot; situation helped me understand this current season.  If you are a fan I recommend this set.
6303402348|5.0|This movie was moving and funny. I enjoyed the part when Forrest says to President Kennedy, &quot;I gotta pee.&quot; It was hilarious. Lt. Dan was hilarious also especially when he puts his ice cream cone in the bed pan. Now that I no longer own this movie (I borrowed it from my uncle and the VCR wore it out so we got him a new one.) I think about the scenes with Jenny as a little girl. Who would know that this girl was to lead a terrible life. I will always remember this movie.
B000002J09|5.0|This may as well be Led Zepplin's greatest hits.  This album, sometimes called &quot;Zoso&quot; among other things, contains a great deal of the band's hits, most notably, &quot;Stairway To Heaven.&quot;  Other greats, such as &quot;Rock And Roll,&quot; and &quot;Misty Mountain,&quot; which are a few of my favorites.  I certainly reccomned the album to any good, solid rock fan.  It is a neecesity.
0394800389|5.0|Although Amazon advertises this book for ages 4-8, my wife and I started reading this and other Seuss books to our children from 6 months on.  Always a delight, our kids would laugh at the silliness while acquiring a zest for life at the same time.  We started a great habit of reading two or three Seuss books before bed, and the kids loved them.  Soon, they would memorize many of the phrases, beginning a lifelong passion for reading.<br />Every kid should experience reading Fox in Socks while growing up.  Join the Fox in Socks as he leads Mr. Knox on a zany adventure of learning and silly rhymes.  Combine it with other fun Seuss books and your kids will sit enthralled as you turn the pages.  Highly recommended.
B000002J09|5.0|This may as well be Led Zepplin's Greatest Hits.  I've always called it &quot;Zoso&quot; though, like many great albums, it has many names.  A few of my faves: Stairway to Heaven (Of course), Rock And Roll, Misty Mountain, and When the Levee Breaks.  The album as a whole is marvelous, and every good rock fan should own it!
B000021Y77|5.0|This is an amazing film. Very German. I also highly recommend the soundtrack (which is even better if you drive a German car). This is a great film to watch over and over again. It's also really good to show to a friend whose never seen it before... The quality of the sound is very good; and the commentary track is enjoyable.
B000002B7M|5.0|This was an unbeleivable start to Ozzy's solo career. It's also a good cd to start with if you're just getting into Ozzy. Every song is outstanding and it demonstrates Randy Rhoads skill. He was a truly amazing guitar player. I strongly recommend this cd if you are a guitar player. It will give you some great new things to learn. Buy it.
0790733226|4.0|I really enjoy this movie... I wish there were more special features though. I would have liked to see if there were any deleted scenes...
B00005QHPQ|5.0|This album is the best yet to bring back the 80's beat with a millenium twist to it. Enrique has done a wonderful job in reinventing the 80's like no other one has. Especially the song &quot; Escape&quot;. This album not only brings the 80's back but also gives enrique fans a new style to enjoy rather his pop/dance music. BUY THIS CD... ANd you wil be SuPRizeD!! guaranteed. Sounds like nothing you've heard in a longgggggggggggg time.
0790737345|4.0|This is a very nice love story, one of the best love movies I have ever seen. I also really liked the way it shows that you cannot believe only in materialism and that there's nothing beyond, as that's a very empty life. It may be happy in its own (blind) way, but it's actually very empty. This is what a young doctor (Meg Ryan) discovers and decides to change. The movie is very sweet throughout, but not sappy. Beware, as it's not a happy movie, though!
0140042520|5.0|To those of you who have only read &quot;On the<BR>Road&quot;, you need to read this book. Kerouac<BR>made great strides as a writer after<BR>he wrote his first book.

0385505833|2.0|Personally, I thought the concept of the book would be a light hearted boost to the holiday season.  However, I found Grisham to be continuing his downward spiral in his profession.  The story took one pathetic turn after another leaving you with the feeling that &quot;the main characters&quot; were not the crazy ones, but the rest of the world was.  I don't believe human nature to be as shallow as Grisham seems to make us feel.  If a new author on the scene had tried to push this book past a publisher, he would have had a dumpster full of rejection notices.  But of course, the Grisham name sells books even as he continues to crank them out faster than hollywood can make the next movie. Once a huge fan because of his research and detail, now very leary of picking up the next &quot;new&quot; Grisham &quot;tragedy&quot;.
B00005JKMO|3.0|This is the type of film that demonstrates that you can have an Oscar-caliber performance without having an Oscar caliber film. Will Smith is phenomenal. He was fantastic and really helped to bring the viewer to having an experience rather than just watching a movie.<br />You see that while Ali stood up for his beliefs and had a great charismatic flair with the media, he was less than a gem when it came to his fidelity with the women he married... especially when those who married him were totally devoted to him and gave him good advice that he dismissed and ignored.<br />Ali was and still is a fascinating human being and is known as being the most famous living person on earth... pretty stupendous accomplishment in of itself.<br />My less than perfect rating for the film does not reflect upon the acting of any member of the cast... they were all phenomenal and Mario Van Peebles will blow you away with his portrayal of Malcom X.  Jon Voight outdid himself as Howard Cosell and Jamie Foxx deserves big-time recognition for his role as Bundini, the author of many Ali quotes such as &quot;float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.&quot;<br />The film opens up with the location and date... 1957. You see young Cassius Clay going to the back of the bus with his mother and you see him read a disturbing story about the torture-murder of a young black boy in the south... this is obviously intended as a glimpse to his motivation as an adult to convert to Islam, but this is the only such overt scene.<br />As the show continues, there are no more on-screen texts telling you the date, so there is not only a continuity problem, you are really wondering... what date is this supposed to be?<br />The movie should have been a bit longer and have included more character development of Ali as a child.<br />The world knows the adult Ali from the media... and much of the film involves his public persona, not the underpinnings of what motivates him to cheat on his wife or for him to stay aligned with the Nation of Islam after they ban Ali from being a Muslim for publicly stating he was broke (hence unwittingly stating that the Nation of Islam had mis-managed his funds). Despite the murder of his good friend Malcom X at the hands of those working for the Nation of Islam, Ali stands behind the organization and continues to covort with the same folks as before. Sticking to one's faith doesn't need to be explained, but why he stuck with this same organization and this same motley crew is not explained and therefore befuddling.<br />There are some scenes that should have been on the cutting room floor but instead were left in the movie for some unknown reason... my best guess is just to pepper the movie with as many historical references as possible tied in with Ali's fighting career.<br />Levar Burton portrays Martin Luther King, Jr., but you never hear him speak in the film. You see him once in a newspaper photo and then laying dead after being shot... there is no reason to have included these two scenes that are in no way connected to the rest of the movie. MLK may have been closely tied in with Ali's story in real life, but the film drops the ball in explaining the relationship.<br />Later you see the leader of the African nation in which Ali fights George Foreman have a covert meeting with Idi Amin. This disjointed scene has no overt connection with the rest of the film and appears to be another effort to squeeze in another Trivial Persuit question/answer into the film.<br />The film ends with some last-minute paragraphs in an attempt to tie up Ali's life in a little bow. This film had the potential to be so much more than it was. Ali was and still is a larger-than life character, but the film does not step up the plate. The teleplay needed some major re-working and a number of scenes were lacking when others should have been edited out. Character development is far more important than including frivilous details.<br />There are many funny moments andthe outstanding performances will be more memorable than the film itself. Definitely worth seeing, but go early for the matinee.the outstanding performances will be more memorable than the film itself. Definitely worth seeing, but go early for the matinee.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|OK...I rented the movie on a whim...after I watched it for the first time alone, I had Moulin Rouge Parties for the remainder of the movie rental period! Then, I kept the movie one more night to see Nicki and Ewin spin their magic. The extra charge was worth it! Sit back, dim the lights, and enjoy this CD.
B000002572|5.0|I just bought this album recently and it is already rapidly becoming one of my favorite albums of all time. It's very refreshing to listen to this band, as they do not belong to any complicated mixture of sub-genres. They're just good old fashioned rock. There is not a weak track on this record. It also features some very nice guitar work. The interesting thing about this record is that it starts out soft, with the opening guitar of More Than A Feeling, and it ends soft with the lovely Let Me Take You Home Tonight. In between, however, there is some of the rockingest music you can hope to find.<BR>I would recommend this album to absolutely anyone who can appreciate great music that just makes you feel good.
0812550757|5.0|People who are turned off by science fiction will miss on a book whose greatness transcend the subject itself. The author is a wonderfull story teller.
B00005O5JV|5.0|Awesome movie! Actually though, I did expect it to be funnier, but it was funny in parts! Its a gr8 movie about a girl who gets to Harvard Law School just because her Boyfriend dumped her cuz he wanted a smarter law student to marry. And the reason she got accepted into the school is because of her good looks. On the way she learns true love and how much she really does love Harvard Law school!
0375507507|5.0|Alexandra Fuller captures the essence of Africa through words in a way I have seldom read.  Her descriptions bring forth an array of sensory memories that can be comforting, overwhelming and unwanted all at the same time.  Alexandra/Bobo provides the reader a glimpse of life in colonial, transitional and post-colonial African in an unapologetic, uncomplicated manner.  The story of the Fullers in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia is not the tale of advantaged expatriates or diplomats living in Africa.  Rather it is a chronicle of a working-class farmer and his family, an existence subject to the whims of Mother Nature and the tides of political change.
0767809246|5.0|This is one of my faves of all time! I must have seen this movie over 10 times before I was even 10 yrs old! I was just thinking about this movie the other day cuz I havent seen it for a while, and there it was on tv! I loved watching it again one more time! Itsa great movie about 4 12yr old boys who set out to find the body of a boy along some railroad tracks, and they run into some problems along the way (arguments, money, leeches, and trains) while their friendship just grows stronger.
B00005RHGK|5.0|Wow...What a Great Movie. Salva is making new ground for the horror biz. This movie which has taken themes of suspense from the 50's films such as &quot;Creature of The Black Lagoon&quot; and transformed it into a new fear which does not concentrate on gore and blood to spurt the screen. The end was very creative, yet abrupt(if the D.O.P. had gotten his angles and lighting better organised). It's main cast Gina Philips from &quot;Telling You&quot; and Justin Long who plays a witty &quot;Warren Cheswick&quot; on the NBC Show &quot;Ed&quot; makes this film complete and steady from scare to scare.
0783232039|2.0|I feel out of place giving this such a low score, but its how I feel! The first time I watched this back in '98 when it came out, I thought it was pretty good. Then I recently watched it again and I thought it was so stupid, these Chucky movies arent scarry at all, I dont understand why people think they are! Its kind of more like a comedy than a horror! But whatever, If you like these Childs Play movies, youll probably like this one!
B00005QIPH|3.0|I listened to this album on the suggestion of my cousin. He figured I'd probably like it since I am a Velvet Underground fan. Although I definitely wouldn't say it's an awful album, I can't give it a glowing recommendation. The melodies and rhythms are so similar in every song that it's difficult to differentiate one from another. Julian's vocals don't really change, either. He should work on doing something about that. The title track, &quot;Is This It&quot; is by far one of the worst songs on the album. It never goes anywhere, it drags. But there are a few tracks that I do enjoy, such as &quot;Barely Legal&quot; and the infectiously catchy single, &quot;Last Nite.&quot; &quot;Soma&quot; is one of the better tracks, as well as &quot;The Modern Age,&quot; although I found the wail towards the end of the song (2:49) to be an obvious Lou Reed ripoff. Listen to any Velvet Underground or Lou Reed album and you will hear what I'm talking about. Maybe he did it as a tribute to him? Overall, &quot;Is This It&quot; is not a bad album. I just think they need to work on developing more of an original sound rather than being a mere emulation of their musical influences. I believe they are talented and capable enough to accomplish that.
B00004SCX6|2.0|This album just shows that Britney is musically illiterate. I mean, Oops is just a rehashed reedited version of Baby One More Time. By the cheeky title, it proves that she has done it again - had her brilliant production team redo the song that made her famous and exploding onto the charts. The rest of the songs are okay except Satisfaction, which got a funky cover , but other than that, there nothing to write home about.
B000003N7G|5.0|As so many informative notes have been written here about &quot;Love Supreme&quot; I will concentrate on one aspect only of Trane's art: spirituality.<br />Around 1958/59 John Coltrane found a new meaning to his life and became a profoundly spiritual person who &quot;believed in all religions&quot;. &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; is just one, but probably the most beautiful, expression of his love for the Lord. Others include &quot;Meditations&quot; and &quot;Transition&quot; - which also take a form of a suite reminiscent of &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; - and above all  - &quot;Ascension&quot;. But one single, short composition that most serenely and beautifully treats John's feelings about God is &quot;Dear Lord&quot;. It seems that Trane was taken by God to heaven right after the musician completed his mission here in 1967. What else could he play ? He took the music to its apex.
0767814037|5.0|A truly great western and one of a few modern ones that can hold there own with any made in the John Wayne and early Eastwood era.  Lots of stars in this flick with a very young looking Costner and a whole bunch of talent in small roles that will later appear as costars or stars  in entire movies.  The plot is very well written the characters believable and the shoot out scenes lots of fun to watch.  The horse riding and cinematography are both very beautiful.  I first saw this in the theaters and was impressed, it is still fun to watch.  A very strong recommendation to any that like westerns but I would venture that any movie watcher would at the very least not feel they wasted time.  A good movie to own can be  watched multiple times.
6304401132|5.0|This has to be the sweetest, most enchanting fairytale of all. How could I have ever forgotten this captivating fairytale? The three fairies that help protect the Princess Aurora, the mean, evil witch, Prince Phillip, the dragon, all spun together to make a tale that boys, girls, young &amp; old would enjoy. I saw the beauty of this movie thru my eyes as a child, now my grand-daughters eyes.This timeless movie is a must for all children to see. Its a remembrance of a time when life was magical and beautiful, full of the things sweet dreams are made of.
1587990717|2.0|Comments on Nassim Taleb's ?Fooled by Randomness?<br />I must first say that I am not a trader or a mad scientist trying to tell were the stock market is heading. I am just an engineer and an entrepreneur for quite a while. Being interested by stock markets I read Taleb's book and found it rather annoying. Not because of the points Taleb is trying to run home, nor because I certainly agree with the fact that a lot of ?Masters of the Universe? are mere mortals with a little more luck than others - You see the same happening among entrepreneurs - No, the reason is the tremendous amount of platitude that fill the book from page one.<br />Over the course of the past 15 years I have had some success and some failures but overall I'm making rather good and I am happy with my life. I believe I was a bit lucky on average. So why did I need to react on this book?<BR>Taleb's tone is arrogant as if he was revealing some great information to all the blind in this world. He also thinks that the world starts and finishes with the stock markets and that the rest is a sort of decoration to entice the otherwise dull trader's world. <BR>Now let me point out to some mistreated scientific laws.<br />Survivorship bias caught Taleb right in the face<br />At page 159 Taleb is mentioning a supposedly embarrassing experiment with doctors being asked about the probability of a patient being struck by a given disease. As it comes out in Taleb's book, only one out of five professionals (doctors) got the answer right, the answer was 1/51. Taleb therefore concludes that you should's trust your doctor when he tests you for a disease, given (in this particular example) that you have roughly 2% chance of actually being sick. Well, I disagree ferociously!<BR>If, like Taleb, you spend your time reading reports from the pharma industry on how they test the quality of a new drug, instead of trying to imagine what is the every day life for a doctor in his practice you are biased, big time. Let me explain : If you take randomly 1000 people knowing statistically that one is stricken by that particular illness and put them trough a test that is accurate (minus false positives) at only 95%, you get indeed 1/51 probability. Does this correspond to a real life situation? <BR>No! In real life, say we have 10% hypochondriacs and say this particular illness hurts (which most do), so what is the population you would find in the doctor's practice? 90% of the people who go to a doctor and feel sick are actually sick. Say a doctor treats a thousand patience in a given period of time, 900 will be sick and 100 will not. The test will find 905 people stricken out of a 1000 patients which translates into a 90.5% chance of being sick once you decided to go to your doctor's practice because you don't feel well. This changes the odds that your doctor might be right after all, doesn't it ? On this illustration I must say I don't doubt doctors are not very good at mathematics but some of those having taken the test maybe just extrapolated live experiences from their everyday dull life (as we read in Taleb's book).<br />Using Taleb's filtering method would have gotten me an F in electronics class<br />Though I understand what Taleb is trying to run home with the example of page 167, what he says is plain wrong. To dissociate noise from signal, you don't do amplitude filtering but frequency filtering. You take your signal function as amplitude over time and do a Fourrier transform to get amplitude over frequency, the noise's frequency being  at least a factor of scale higher than the signal itself, with an in-band filter you can keep only the band of frequencies around the signal and get rid of the noise. I would advise Mr. Taleb to read an electronics book sometimes to get his basics right.<br />Final words<br />Having spoken with friends in the banking business (that is a Swiss platitude), I must say that Taleb's central point is certainly interesting and revealing for them and I givethe book some credit for that. Nevertheless, the constant bashing of others, the less than rigorous approach, some too quickly drown conclusions make me say the book lacks credibility. My final words are for Mr. Taleb to think about: In French we say ?La culture c'est comme la confiture, moins on en a, plus on l'étale? (culture is like jam, the less you have of it, the more you spread it out thin). <BR>Solon would appreciate, he who saw the future of Croesus in the bowels of a bird!<br />Pierre Kladny
6301934229|5.0|Can someone really play this part as well as Rutger Hauer and not be just a little insane themselves? Edge of you seat suspense! Just when you think it can't get any worse, it does. You could never put yourself in the place of C. Thomas Howell, who picks up hitch-hiker Rutger Hauer, and never think that a good deed could turn so bad so fast. If you've never picked up a hitch-hiker, but have heard all the warnings and horror stories why you shouldn't, you haven't heard the best till now. Rutger Hauer is relentless in his persuit of C. Thomas Howell. Even when he thinks he's rid or Hauer, he shows up again and again, like the bad penny he is. Penny hell! He's a quarter atleast!
B00003W8NM|5.0|I had absolutely no desire to see this movie based on trailers and ads. The marketing folks made it look like a juvenile, gory, bare-knuckled boxing flick. Life's too short for that, so I ignored it.<br />When my son returned from winter camp, he kept insisting that we rent the movie. Knowing that he hangs with creative, rebellious &amp; inciteful people, I got a copy.<br />I couldn't watch it once--I had to watch it a second time. The movie challenges socially constructed ideas of masculinity in several ways. It mocks them. It presents alternatives. It runs one idea to its apocalyptic conclusion. <br />This is a disturbing movie, but well worth the time to watch ... and be careful, you, too, may feel compelled to watch it a second time. But remember, it's just a movie, as the characters keep reminding us. <br />If you watch this on DVD, make certain that the disk is clean before starting. Although not a bad idea for any movie, one _MUST_ do this to fully appreciate this one.
B00000DHTF|5.0|I'll start of by saying Tracks is fantastic, yes it contains some rubbish, songs obviously unfinished and that have lyrics picked from the Boss's parts bin, but overall it's worth five stars, in fact it would get five stars for just two of it's songs, firstly \\"Back In Your Arms\\" and secondly \\"Happy\\" which is, I think the best love song ever written and deserves more recognition than it will get on the final disk of a box set that will, I guess mainly be bought by Springsteen fans. So there are some bad songs on these CD's but there are loads of good ones many that have never been heard before, but where is \\"Trapped\\", that song is brilliant and should have been included.
6304698658|4.0|Watching this film, myself, as an adult, I was just hysterical with laughter; I loved it!!<br /> But, watching it, as a father, well, I'll just say...it's not a family film. I felt on a whole, it's no worse than the &quot;Home Alone&quot; films, with the laugh-out-loud physical humor; on the other hand, there was brief nudity, and strong language (they say the 'F' word once, but still...), I can't comfortably allow my children to enjoy this film, and share the humorous moments (and there were many) with me.<br /> In short, I loved it. I appreciate good comedy. But, if you are searching for a wholesome, family Holiday film the whole entire family can enjoy together...well, um keep searching. As an adult, I enjoyed it; as a dad, I have to say it's not entirely approriate for younger viewers.
B00005JKT8|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable movie!  Just suspend belief in reality and enjoy. Meg Ryan, who is always cute no matter what, seemed to be off her usual perky self.  But Hugh Jackman is a WOW!!  He carries his role handsomely (literally), and we never doubt his royalty.  I agree with the reviewer who said he hoped this was his breakout role, and \\"message to Hollywood\\" - put Hugh Jackman in more movies!
6305622930|5.0|Patton on DVD is a classic and should be owned by any WWII movie buff. The only complaint I can think of is that sometime the dialog seems to be a bit on the soft side, maybe I just had the volume too low. But other than that this is a great classice that everyonew with a DVD player should own.
B00005ASHM|5.0|The consensus is that this remains one of the truly great and unique albums of all time with Wouldn't It Be Nice, Sloop John B, Caroline No, and God Only Knows among others.<br />Although it has become fashionable to pan &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; in favor of some of the beatles' fare, reviewers like aaron should know that sgt. pepper came out after Pet Sounds, therefore it was lennon/mccartney reacting to Brian Wilson, not vice versa. Brian Wilson was the embodiment of the complete artist - lyricist, songwriter, arranger, musician and producer.  As good as they were, neither lennon or mccartney could compete with that. 5-stars - easily.

B000002UAU|3.0|In my opinion, although Sgt. Pepper is O.K., the Beatles earlier albums (Rubber Soul &amp; Revolver) and the later albums (White Album &amp; Abbey Road) are better than the 66/67 albums - Magical Mystery Tour and Sgt. Pepper. <br />Regarding Sgt. Pepper: the title tracks and A Day in the Life are good, but there is a lot of filler to skip over like When I'm 64 and Within You, Without You.  Therefore it gets a 3, as in adequate.
0156711427|4.0|This is an accomplished novel.  Beautifully written and interesting, it portrays a very believable world of people who quite probably no longer exist.  Everything is visualized, from the tedious monotiny of the 'proper British sort' of the early 20th Century to the haunting menace and lingering sense of doubt that such a shallow and repressed existence must struggle with.  Add to that the mysterious and incomprhensible alien nature of a foreign society the lead characters never imagined and the force of the book can take on a fascinating sociological spin.<br />Of what I've read, this is my favorite book by Forester, an author whom I regard as a pretty and absorbing writer of generally dull moments.  This book simply succeeds in keeping the reader rivited on numbness in the face of catastrophe more consistantly than Howard's End or A Room With A View.
B00005QATY|5.0|I'm not a &quot;Dumb movie&quot; type person, so I wasn't really looking forward to &quot;O brother, where art thou&quot; But after the first 5 minutes, I knew I'd love it. <BR>  George Clooney is perfect!! &quot;I am a man of constant sorrow&quot; Was great, though the rest of the music kind of had me plugging my ears. This is truly a one of a kind movie. SEE IT!!! Don't listen to people who say it's stupid.
B00000K31V|1.0|I think watching this movie actually lowered my I.Q.  I'm a fan of really bad movies.  I actually own &quot;Boxing Helena&quot; and &quot;Sliver,&quot; so you can see that my tastes tend towards the corny... But this movie was soooo bad that not even I could find anything of redemptive value in it.  It seems to have been written by ninth-grade boys who were high at the time.  The special effects also seem to have had about a comparable budget.  I only made it through the first hour of this movie, mainly because I was too paralyzed by the sheer awfulness of it to get my frozen finger to press the &quot;off&quot; button.  If I were Jude Law, I would make it my life's quest to hunt down every copy and burn it.
B00005TT77|5.0|If your movie budget can't afford to use the real Beatles then this is pretty darn good. IF Beatles originals are A+ this CD is B+.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This CD is great, much better, in my opinion, than their first.  The songs all have a beautiful and in some instances haunting melodies.  The lyrics really get emotional and you can tell that the artists are trying to actually communicate, not just sing.  Amazing!

B00005QZ7U|2.0|The stars in this review are solely for the stunning visuals.  While I have spent time watching worst movies, I simply cannot believe the amount that went into this supremely unoriginal conceit of a film.  La Kidman oozes glamore from a bygone era, but even she could not keep me tuned into this messy reeking fop.  From the kitchy score and dated soundtrack, to the unbearable acting and staggeringly unfunny lines, this film moves me not.  The script begs the question of just why this film was made.  It could have been a soso film if the director wasn't intent on gagging the audience with the hellatious singing of all involved.  This will be a sad footnote on musicals in the 21st century.  I cannot say more than to advise watching with the volume down...way down.
0790729652|5.0|Tim Burton the director of this film did a wonderful job on It. He inspired burton fans. He made the film dark. The movie had a great music composer Danny Elfman his been doing queit a few of burton films. The movie is about Gotham City is a sunless, ominous haven for criminals, held in the corrupt grip of crime boss Carl Grissom (the ever-magnetic Jack Palance), and terrorized by a sadistic vandal and murderer known as The Joker. But it isn't long before a dark, mysterious caped crusader, who goes by the name of BATMAN, is on their trail and trying to thwart their evil doings. In this darkly entertaining retelling of the Marvel comic classic, ace photojournalist Vicki Vale (warmly and sympathetically played by Kim Basinger) is also on the trail--she wants to find out who Batman really is. So go and see it.

B00005JKES|3.0|I first watched the Twin Peaks series on the SCI-FI Channell approx 3 years ago & was blown away by how good the series was. My main reason for buying a DVD was that I heard that Twin Peaks was to be available on DVD,... I live in the UK & was worried if this version had RCE(Region Coding Enhancemnet) on, this has NOT I am pleased to say & plays on multi region players with no problems.<br />The first thing I was peeved with was where is the Pilot episode I naturally thought this would have been included, not so. ...<br />The Second thing I was not to pleased about was the packaging of the Box set. There are 4 DVD's in essentially a Cardboard folder, not a normal robust DVD case, this will not take long to get dog eared if not respected properly.<br />The final thing I could not see the point of was the fact that they have converted the format to 4:3 from 16:9 why not give the user the option of Widescreen? Widescreen is becoming the norm these days.... I hope the Second series gets released in a better state, that's if they can be bothered to release it, which would not suprise me.

0790736039|2.0|Ah, the old giant spider down the sewer disguised as clown ploy. Nobody creeps up behind me with the old giant spider down the sewer disguised as clown ploy. I'm a Stephen King survivor. It's a support group, you know. A group of kids are not fooled by the giant spider down the sewer disguised as clown ploy and decide that this flagrant violation of local bye-laws shall not go unpunished. Naughty spider, stop what you are doing - that sort of thing. Call it a manifesto, if you like. Not to be out done, the spider retaliates with a manifesto of his own. &quot;I am the eater of worlds and of children&quot; he tells them. I do wish he'd get on with it then. I'm sorry, but popping up every few years and dancing in the streets dressed as a clown is not exactly cutting it in the world domination stakes. If he got on with the eating of worlds bit then the eating of children bit would sort of take care of itself, wouldn't it? But then spiders are not very bright. You yell at them to get the hell out of the bath from your vantage point standing on the sink but do they listen? No! Anyway, this spider gets his manifesto the wrong way round and has to resort to the old werewolf down the boiler room with attitude problem and no shoes ploy. The kids are not impressed by the old werewolf down the boiler room with attitude problem and no shoes ploy so they buy a sling shot for a couple of dollars and let rip.<br />Years later they get together as adults and decide local bye-laws are still not being closely adhered to. Unfortunately, Richie has grown up to be a loud mouth who keeps insisting everyone leave town. Go already. So annoying is he that it's a wonder 'The Losers Club' as they are so monickered, don't borrow a gun off the clown and shoot him. Trouble is, a red flag saying 'BANG' would probably come out the end. The team decide they must go down the sewer and arrest the spider for over acting in a built up area. Just before they do, Richie tells them he's leaving for the airport. Go already. His mouth is so big you could fly a plane into it and still have room for a golf course. In the sewer they find a very small door. Now how does a spider go about carpentry? Did it kidnap Santa's elves? (It's a very small door and a few kids in the town won't be needing their presents anyway, heh-heh). It is at this dramatic point in the story that one of the team decides that this is just the moment to have a nervous breakdown over the fact that he's never had sex. Stop whining, it's never done me any harm. They find the door is easy to open. Great, he's the eater of worlds and he can't even afford a decent home security system. Now, in 'Annie Hall', Woody Allen sorted out a spider in Annie's bath the size of a Buick with a tennis racquet. I mean, Woody had the tennis racquet, not the spider. Unfortunately, The losers Club are faced with a spider the size of Wisconsin. There is no choice but to get stuck in and give the spider a quite comprehensive duffing up. That'll teach it to sell balloons without a license. It goes quiet and they walk away. Now, this is a mistake. Spiders curl into a ball and play dead and then they suddenly attack you when you're sitting on the floor with the headphones on. Spiders are not so dumb. Which contradicts what I said earlier. So sue me, already.<br />How long is this film? Felt like years. What really scares me is the thought that Stephen King may drop his shopping list and a producer will grab it and turn it into a series. After this debacle, I wouldn't want to be the production company that handles his potatoes.
1572523166|5.0|i've always found that solitude and loneliness are two of the best outlets for artistic expression. prime examples of this include, 'the metamorphosis,' by franz kafka, 'wish you were here,' by pink floyd, and this astounding film, 'the man who fell to earth.'<br />the movie has a relatively simple plot. an alien comes to earth looking for water for his dying planet. he meet's a sensitive (yet boring and boozy), young woman who he has an affair with, but all the while, his heart is not on earth. it is on his home planet where his family is dying of thirst.<br />at first, his mission stays on track. he starts a huge electronics corporation and begins building a machine that will be able to transport water into out space (nobody knows it's true purpose). however, he is soon corrupted by alcohol, meaningless sex, and television, and his mission starts to fall apart.<br />on top of that, there are higher powers bent on destroying his mission and siezing the money he has made, and soon finds all those he thought were his friends desert him in his time of need. as he goes into an alcoholic daze, we realize that all of the characters are aging except for him, so presumably he has spent decades here on earth. it is at this point that his mission is completely lost, and he will never be able to return home.<br />bowie's performance in this film is astounding. he assumes the role of an alien so perfectly, and he is simply so beautiful and androgynous. it's a wandering, isolated movie, not to be watched alone.
B00005OCMR|4.0|Greetings, Program!<br />It seems the previous reviews were written about some other, earlier DVD edition of this film.  The 20th Anniversary Edition is a great 2-Disc package with plenty of extras, including a 1 1/2 hour retro-documentary of the making of both the original film and this DVD edition. Also included are a collection of production drawings by Moebius, Storyboards & Animatics, Deleted Scenes, and some deleted music! (Please note that Disney & Wendy Carlos have FINALLY remastered the original soundtrack and added a few missing tracks for a new CD due to release January 29th. 2002!) Check out ... for the full story why this took so long!<br />This new edition is well worth the price and is certain to please die-hard TRON fans!  In the Supplementary materials, Director Steven Lisberger even hints at the possibility of a sequel! TRON 2.0!<br />A word of warning to Sony Playstation2 Users! There is a MAJOR GLITCH that seems to only affect Playstation2...during Chapter 8, the scene where Flynn/CLU is introduced to RAM in the Game-Grid holding cells, the picture wigs-out into a mess of pixelated garbage and artifacts that can only be eliminated by resetting the machine!  I returned my DVD to [retail store], only to discover the defect on the replacement disc, as well!  The defect did not show up when I played the disc on a friend's dedicated DVD Player. (a small horizontal blip/glitch did appear, but caused no serious problems.)<br />Playstation Users - If you experience this Glitch, Please do not hurry to return \\"defective\\" discs to Amazon.com!  You can get past this glitch by simply \\"fast-forwarding\\" a frame, or two, past the problem spot! In fact, if Playstation2 is your only means of playing DVDs, you may have no alternative!  <br />There is also a small problem with the Sound Mix during SARK's Introductory Speech to the \\"Programs\\" being readied for the Game Grid....When SARK is not actually On-Screen, or is seen from the Grid Warriors' Point-Of-View, hisdialogue volume drops noticably to the point where his speech is quite difficult to understand!<br />Hopefully, the manufacturer will remedy these problems in a subsequent pressing.  But, Playstation2 & Sound Glitches aside, this a wonderful package that I highly recommend!  I was lucky enough to find the disc on [retail store's] shelves a few days before the release date!  ...but buy yours here, the price is the same!<br />End of line...
0380729407|4.0|I had heard a lot about this book, but just recently decided to read it.  I was glad I did.  The book is NOT science fiction (as the cover states) but is a wonderful and dark fantasy.<br />Steven King, in Danse Macbre, notes that this book is a universal childhood fantasy book.  I would qualify this just a bit, it is a &quot;boys&quot; childhood fantasy, and may be universal for boys.  This distance from my personal experience(I'm a woman) didn't harm the book in the least.  The themes are universal, so, while it may not strike and &quot;I know that!&quot; chord, it sure does ring true.<br />Not the scariest, or spookiest, but full of wonderful images and tense moments.

What did you do to him?\\" He confronts Logan with the girl in his arms. \\"Is this good, is this what you want?\\" Wails Francis. \\"We had good times buddy!\\" Unfortunately, Francis comes off a little worse for wear and is last seen staring lovingly up into Logan's eyes. \\"Hey, Logan, you renewed!\\" But what does Francis think Logan has renewed? Later, sitting around a camp fire, Jessica and Logan discover that men and women used to marry and stay with each other for life out of a sense of love. Logan smiles. He likes the idea. Poor Francis is probably turning in his grave.
0783240503|5.0|What can I say about &quot;Joseph&quot;?  Well, it's certainly a show that has been added to my personal collection-in both DVD and VHS form!  I received it on DVD for Christmas, and I watched it about 4-6 times before I left to go back to school.  There's just something about seeing a true story acted out like a fairytale, yet true at the same time, on the screen.  I ordered the VHS to show it to my hallmates at school- they've never seen it before!  I can't wait to get the VHS in my CPO!<br />Besides the whole effect, there's just something that Mr. Osmond adds to the musical that I don't think anyone else could offer- the childlike wonder and the sparkle of maturity that comes only from distinguished actors with great experience in the theatre.  I think everyone who has seen the video/DVD can agree with me that &quot;Close Every Door&quot; from when Joseph is in prison was written with Donny Osmond in mind- it was pure genious musical scoring by Sir Andrew Lloyd Weber.  I have listened to every sample of that song from every soundtrack on Amazon.com, and none of the other Josephs sing it with the same emotion and intensity that Donny does.<br />I agree that the Mrs. Potiphar's bedroom scene is quite risque, but so is the Elvis scene, if you look at the servant's costumes!  This video is meant for the family- and though some of you might not want your children seeing such things on the TV, you have to admit that they'll see it somewhere else later that day on cable TV.  My suggestion: Sit down with your children and explain WHY these costumes were used; it's better than them hearing it from anyone else, and they have to learn about it sooner or later.<br />All in all, six out of five stars- Thank You, Sir Andrew Lloyd Weber!
0340393653|5.0|This story is a little bit out of reality, but it keeps you interested in the book and you can compare the FBI with the former KGB as they work almost in the same manner.

B00004SVID|5.0|Pink Floyd are so old that their newer fans have lost a sense of time and the past.  This isn't a reguritated effort to rip the fans.  This is a chronicle of one of rock's finest moments.  Unfortunately, only a lucky few were there to see Rog, Dave, Rick and Nick show the world what rock was capable of.  As a collector, I had a copy of the Nassau shows in early '83 and I was in awe.  Almost 20 years later, technology and mass production has caused this recording to be a victim of inflation.<BR>Put this recording in perspective and you'll realize that show is as important as many other live giants such as Live at Leeds, Get Yer Ya-yas out, and The Song Remains the Same.
B00005U122|5.0|This DVD is awesome.  Both the sound and the picture are great.  This show is also available on CD, which came out in 2000.  I had been looking forward to the DVD for a long time and it was well worth it.  I saw Roger Waters in West Palm on the 2000 leg of the In The Flesh tour, and with the DVD I can relive the show over and over again.<BR>I recommend this DVD to any Floyd/Waters fan.
B00000IPAX|5.0|first of all, let me say, that if you think blink 182 are not talented.......u should seek therapy. Mark and Tom are 100 times better than your average guitarist but Travis Barker is by far the most unbelievable drummer on planet Earth. Im a drummer myself and if at all i have any idol........its Travis. One listen to songs such as 'Whats my age again?' and &quot;Adams song' will instantly let you how talented these 3 young guys are. Whatever ur tastes in music are.........If you dont own this album.......you dont know what music and talent is.......AT ALL<br />P.S GUYS.....PLZ TELL ULL BE COMING TO THE MIDDLE EAST SOON!
B000053GTF|5.0|from a very wonderful vocal performer. Her videos aren't very inventive, but watching her in interviews...her personality, her charm, her humor is why I enjoy watching her videos-she shows a lot of respect and grace. And this is why I gave the video collection a 5. Not to mention this collection stems from the A Decade of Song cd...which has all of her hits on it, plus new tracks. 'Memorial tunes from movies and personal 'times' within yourself will take you back to that moment that you heard the song.<br />She's top on my list of vocal performers and I'm pleased to hear that she's coming back with new material. Those who like vocal performers, I doubt will be able to get enough songs from the vocal 'diva'. Those who like Celine Dion will enjoy this collection and I highly recommend it to those who enjoy music of the vocal nature!!
B000000OQF|5.0|It's a shame Guns n Roses went down in flames. But how could they ever top their debut album? They never did. Appetite for Destruction is 12 tracks of hard rockin' to the extreme. This album will go down in history as one of the greatest ever. There will never be enough words to praise this album as a staple in every headbanger's collection. It's one of the few albums that you can listen to every song without tempting to hit the skip button.<br />Welcome to the Jungle was the first single and it shot this band into superstardom almost overnight.<br />The very next song 'It's so Easy' keeps the momentum going. Axl's voice change is so extreme, you think at first it's another singer.<br />Nighttrain and Mr. Brownstone give praises to the vices of alcohol and Heroin.<br />I Think About You is one of my very favorites and a very overlooked song. The guitar is awesome. Slash shined on this album from beginning to end, but I always liked this one.<br />Paradise City is a classic even if MTV played it to death. Who doesn't want to be 'where the grass is green and the girls are pretty'?<br />Rocket Queen, Michelle, and Out ta Get me are more great songs.<br />Axl's ego, rotating band members, and softer edged songs spelled Guns n Roses doom, but when this band first hit the charts, they had the potential to be legendary. Unfortunately, after the explosion of Appetite for Destruction, there was nothing left but the settling dust. Too bad.
B0000028RR|5.0|This was actually the last Rage album I purchased, but don't let that fool you. This is an excellent album, with some really explosive and powerful tracks, whether its &quot;Freedom&quot;, &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot;, or my personal favorite, &quot;Wake UP&quot;, which was later featured on the Matrix Soundtrack. Tom's sharp and creative guitar riff's set the perfect backing for some of musics most aggressive and politically fueled lyrics. Unlike lots of other albums on the market, there are no rambling filler tracks that waste your time. This self-titled album shows just how unique Rage Against the Machine are, boasting creative lyrics and music. Here we se fierce, bold, and incredible guitar work throughout the entire album, displaying Morello's creativity, talent, and technical brilliance. The drums on this album, as on others by the band, add a great flavor to the music and have some great beats. The bottom line is this; if you like anything by Rage Against the Machine, check out this album. I know not everyone is drawn to their methods of self-expression, but don't be afraid to listen in.
0553288105|5.0|It's been a while since I read any of Asimov's books - the Foundation series has always been one of my favorite science fiction series. Therefore, I decided to read another classic of Asimov (or at least, so I've been told). &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot; didn't surprise me, yet I was also surprised. Why? Well, the book was terrific, definitely one of Isaac Asimov's greatest novels. But also, I was surprised to see such an amazing description of a fascinating alien society - Asimov usually does not like to write about aliens (at least, that's the impression I've gotten from reading his books), but the &quot;alien part&quot; of the book was SO good, and so well conceived and written, it made me wish Asimov would've written more books in this style.<BR><BR>What is the book about? The book contains 3 parts, each is actually a separate story which revolve around the same theme. <BR>The first part tells the story of Dr. Peter Lamont, a physicist, which recalls how the &quot;Electric Pump&quot;, a device which enables receiving a near-infinite amount of energy as a result of matter transferral between our universe, and another universe which has different laws of nature. Lamont finds that this device might destroy our solar system, and this story depicts his attempt to stop the pump. I really liked this story. It's written in typical Asimov style: witty, humorous and totally brilliant.<BR><BR>The second part tells the story of Odeen, Dua and Tritt - an alien &quot;Triplet&quot; (3 beings which are a family). These aliens live in the other universe and the story describes what happens on this side of the pump (as a result of the events from part one). As I mentioned before, this part was truly amazing. I wish Asimov had written more books about this world, as he created such a fascinating universe. You have to read it to see what I mean.<BR><BR>The third and final part, tells the story of Denison, a scientist which also appeared in the first part, and as a result of events which occured there, moved to the moon. I found this part a bit boring. This part resolves the story lines from parts one and two.<BR><BR><BR>I wholeheartly recommend this book, if only for the second part. Asimov being a professor, this book is filled with real science in a way which integrates with the plot and supports it (contrary to &quot;technobabble&quot; use of science) - this is one of the reasons the book is so good. The only thing which bothered me a bit, is that the first and second parts aren't really resolved on their own, meaning, the story ends only after the third part is over. This disappointed me, because these really were the best parts of the book and I felt somewhat cheated that I could not see how the protagonists reacted to what happened in the end. Nevertheless, this only detracts a little from the book which is still a masterpiece.
B00005JKT8|4.0|I went into the movie knowing nothing about it. I didn't see any previews, I didn't hear or read any reviews. A friend that I went to the movies with wanted to see it, so I said 'what the heck'.<br />It's a unique story line, not one of Ryan's best but very cute, charming, romantic and funny. Towards the end it was drawn out a bit but all &amp; all not bad. And Hugh Jackman ain't bad either!! ;-) I just thought I would throw that in!!<br />Do I say run out and see this movie right away? nah. Take your time, if you don't see it in the theater...catch it on rental when it comes out!!
B00005JKT8|4.0|As a big fan of romance novels set in the regency era, I could tell from the previews that this would be my kinda movie and overall, it was.  Hugh Jackman was believable as a Duke, the perfect gentleman, and he was the perfect actor for this role.  The sky might have been the limit as far as his shining performance goes had he been cast beside someone within his acting league.<br />I was embarassed for Meg Ryan.  Does she not have any friends that tells her the truth?  Whatever she did to her lips, she looked like Jack Nicholson in his role as the Joker in the first Batman movie!  She couldn't even ACT like she was used to her new lips!  When she's drinking a glass of wine, I couldn't even concentrate on the dialogue!  I was too busy watching Meg learning how to drink with her new lips while still in her role as Kate.  Her tired face isn't going to win any beauty contests either.  Not even a local contest!  Someone with Hugh's looks deserved someone better looking.  I'm all for women of all ages being represented in Hollywood and a wrinkle here and there is ok but not when she's got &quot;ugly-morning-face&quot; all throughout the day.  And a talented actress should be able to portray someone who is tired without actually looking worn-out and exhausted.  I don't blame Meg.  I blame the people who chose her for this role.<br />Then there's her hair.  I understand that she was to portray someone who was trying to break the glass ceiling and she needed to wear pants to remind Leopold that he was no longer in his time.  But there are women who are trying to break the glass ceiling who still look feminine and who wear modern skirts.  I don't believe there is ANY requirement that a female has to have a butch hair cut and look worn-down to climb the corporate ladder.  And this is a fantasy after all.  Why fantasize about ugly when you can fantasize about beautiful?  I myself don't wear make-up and wear pants most of the time but if I wanted to see that, I could've looked in the mirror!  I go to the movies to ESCAPE reality not to look for similarities.  I want glitz and glamour in my escapism.<br />Last but not least is her now famous dance of joy that she does in almost every movie I've ever seen her in.  She throws her fists into the air in the same manner and style every time!  Meg wasn't acting as Kate.  Meg was being Meg in a movie about a character named Kate.  Why couldn't they have gotten a talented actress to play Kate?  (someone who's proven they can play versatile roles such as Holly Hunter or almost any British/Australian actress)<br />This fantasy movie was good despite my grumblings about how Kate was represented.  But it saddens me because I see the potential in what might have been.  As it stands now, I have no idea what it was that drew Leopold to Kate.  Her physical points aside, she was suspicious, untrusting, clumsy, uncaring and a lousy cook!  I vote that this movie be remade again with Hugh Jackman and another female actress.  Meg isn't the only thing wrong with this movie but that would be a start.  Those few minutes wasted on the next door neighbor kid should've ended up on the floor of the editing room.  There should have been more of the romance between Kate and Leopold instead.  But that bring me to my final point.  Most glaring of all, I could tell there was no chemistry between these two and I &quot;sighed&quot; over Hugh but did not &quot;sigh&quot; over their romance as I always do when I finish reading my romance novels.in the mirror!

B00005N9CV|1.0|I agree with the first reviewer.  She has become more and more commercial and artisitically empty and uncreative.  In answer to the question posed as to does her beauty make her less talented? No, her lack of talent makes her less talented.
B000002J0G|4.0|Let me start off by saying that, on the whole, Testament is probably one of the best thrash bands ever to pick up their instruments and this is one of their best albums. It's not really death metal but it has more staying power than The Ritual. It's kinda hard to describe it but the songs on this one drive more, a lot like the songs off Legacy and New Order and the drumming, courtesy of John Tempesta rocks (check out his performance on First Strike Still Deadly for more). The rest of the band are excellent as well. Chuck has that throat growl but you can still understand the lyrics, which is good, and James Murphy proves he can play a very competent lead guitar (I miss Alex though). Greg is also still pounding away on the bass as hard as ever. The songs, as I said before, drive as well, which is a good thing thanks to Tempesta laying that foundation. The standouts are of course Low, Dog Faced Gods (cool vocal effects) and my personal favorite, Hail Mary. The ballad is pretty good, too, as Testament are one of the better bands at writing them. None of them are cheesy. Overall this is a great album that sounds modern with the right amount of old school Testament mixed in, a must for fans both old and new.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|If you missed this Australia gem, don't fail to get it when it comes out soon.  The Aussies are rabid about their ballroom dancing, and this movie pokes gentle fun at their obsession with classy wit that is incisive and yet endearing.  The whole movie is stocked with super performances in this tale of the ugly ducking turning into a swan simply because she wants to dance ballroom.  The characters, editing and delivery of all the actors keep this on the cutting edge that make it one you will want to view again and again.<br /><br />Absolutely one of the best!!!
0385505833|4.0|I thought it was a blast.  Just a light-hearted look at life around the holidays.  I would have finished it sooner, but I was too busy decorating my Christmas tree!
B00005OM4N|2.0|I spend a lot of time with my friend's daughters, so it helps me keep my finger on the pulse of today's youth.<br />THIS is good music by today's standards?<br />Okay, okay- I'll admit that when they played the cd for me, it got my booty shaking a little bit.  But no individual songs stood out as being very good.<br />...P>Guys like Britney for obvious reasons.  Young girls look up to her, somewhat perversely, as a role model.  But us middle aged women are left wondering what all the fuss is about.
6305922756|5.0|This is one DVD where you get your money's worth.  All but a few of the extra scenes are fantastic.  Especially wonderful are the bits where the band is musing about the speed of elevators and how your neck brakes if you break the sound barrier or the band's philosophising on the diet of gorillas -  &quot;Gorillas - culture, baboons - subculture&quot;.  Oh, I forgot about the deleted scene where the Sinatra-obsessed cab driver parties with Spinal Tap.  <BR>What's great about a DVD is I can pop it in view a selected scene, say, You Can't Dust for Vomit and get a quick laugh.
B00001ZT6Z|2.0|If you're looking for the classic riffs and unsettling lyrics that made Black Sabbath into the band most easily assoicated with the term &quot;heavy metal,&quot; choose another record. &quot;Headless Cross&quot; is far from Sabbath's best. It's a very dull, pop-metal-sounding album that made me run screaming back to &quot;Black Sabbath, Volume 4.&quot; <br />The musicians on the album -- Tony Iommi, Cozy Powell, Tony Martin, et al-- are, of course, great. However, the songwriting consists of clunky, boring riffs coupled with lyrics that are made up of silly horror movie cliches.<br />If you want a good Sabbath album from the Tony Martin era grab &quot;Eternal Idol.&quot; &quot;Headless Cross&quot; will leave you feeling a little more broke and a lot more annoyed.
0385335482|5.0|A great book for those of us who can't seem to keep within our budget.  If you love Prada and Gucci and designer wear but just can't seem to afford it, then you will be able to relate to Becky!  A story of love and balancing your checkbook!
B00005JGAF|5.0|Rocket to Russia is my favorite album ever,I just can't live<BR>trough a day without Cretin Hop or We're a Happy Family.RTR shows<BR>Ramones at their best.Everything's here:Johnny s beautiful,comma-<BR>nding,hard,but still melodic guitar,Joey s amazing voice,full of<BR>emotions,Tommy's non-stop loud beating,and,of course,DeeDee's<BR>simple,but enjoyable bass lines,and his lyrics(okay,it says songs<BR>are written by the Ramones,but,since DeeDee was the main lyric<BR>writer and composer in the band,I think the praise should go to him).Song are classic Ramones style:you have Joey's great poppy<BR>oriented love songs and ballads(Her Today,Gone Tommorrow,Locket Love),and DeeDee's punk classics(We're a Happy Family,Teenage Lobotomy,Cretin Hop...)There is nothing more to say.This is the <BR>third of Ramones first five albums,...
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I love the world Baz has created- and I think Ewan McGregor is simply brilliant in this film.  Other than the movie itself- which I do agree is not for everyone- this DVD set is everything I could have hoped for.  The extended dance sequences are wonderful- and the rehearsals are really interesting.  Seeing the dancers doing the same choreography in modern dress, on a soundstage shows you just how magnificient the set design,, lighting and costumes really were.  The commentary is really interesting, and the musical extras are also cool.  <br />I can't believe they included the MTV performance of :ady Marmalade- which to me was the least interesting of all the songs in the movie.  I never thought of myself as a Nicole Kidman fan, but I think her look really works- and there are a few goofy scenes where she comes across as very human and real.  <br />I will also say that my my brothers and guy friends are movie watchers- but not musical fans- really like this movie as well.  I am more impressed each time I watch it, and I think this DVD set really adds something unique and special to the typical viewing experience.
B00005RFAI|1.0|One of the other reviewers said if you want to expect R+B and Hip-hop you will be disappointed, and boy was I! It is full of pseudo-Bon Jovi rubbish. Check out the schmaltziest lyrics in the world on 'My vietnam'. At least Britney and Nsync have the integrity not to pretend they're something they're not. This isn't rock music (it just really wants to be), this isn't pop music, and (unfortunately) it isn't R+B (I bought the album without listening to it first on that mistaken impression). Yeah, 'Get the Party Started' is great. That's why it's the first single...it's the only good one on the album...and guess what? It wasn't written by her!!! I've wasted my money on this...and I strongly advise you not to do the same.
B0000508U6|5.0|Simply one of the finest pieces(I consider the CD one connected overture) of music ever written. Not since Matchbox 20's debut album has a CD captivated me like this. Every single track is as good as the &quot;radio play&quot; singles.
014028009X|5.0|I absolutely loved Bridget Jones!  I could feel her pain with the weight gain and tracking everything.  It was so funny to read about her trials and tribulations.  The movie is good, too, but the book gives so much more detail.  Great book!
0446608955|5.0|I started reading this book late one night after watching ER, and finished in the next day during school.  I was practically reading while I walked through the halls.  I loved it so much.  I am such a sucker for a good love story, and this one was definitely a good love story.  The main characters were so sweet and perfect for eachother, and the transormation of Landon was the best.  If you are a girl and you are planning on reading this get a box of Kleenex out.  I cried during the last 20 or 30 pages. It was so touching, I want to read it again. I am also seeing the movie the first weekend it comes out. READ THIS BOOK!!!
B000001DTM|5.0|Combined with The Joshua Tree, this is U2's masterpiece.  You can't have one without the other, because they seem to be two sides of a very amazing coin.  For its side, Achtung Baby brings forth a variety of memorable songs.  My personal favorites are, &quot;Zoo Station,&quot; &quot;Until the End of the World,&quot; &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;Ultra Violet.&quot;  The guitar solos in the middle two are simply spectacular and sometimes breathtaking.  Intense only begins to describe those four songs, along with the others.  If TJT was the questing, searching part of U2, then AB is U2 at their expressive best.
0060278234|5.0|This was a great book, even better then Sabriel! Only a few minor errors, Sam IS a spoiled kid that dosen't know whats good for him, and I can't see how the time zones match up. If an abhorsen was her father how come she is not as old as Sabriel, and why in Sabriel did those ghosts pull her back saying she had to live because she was the last abhorsen if she really wasn't? Or is Sabreil really young or something? But over all the rest was great. <br />It mostly is about Lirael, a girl that is growing up and living with the Clayr. The Clayr can see things in the future, and everyone related to the Clayr gets this power. But somehow Lirael doesn't get the power that is her birth right. Year after year she watches and sees other Clayr become higher then her, and it's quiet depressing. Then she gets a job at the libary, where she spends hours looking at books, and this changes her whole life. Soon the excitement begins. Though this book ends on a terrible cliff hanger it is still wonderful.
6305841861|4.0|and I mean that. This is better than the first one. I don't consider the first one as part of the trilogy though. Not that I don't like the first one, it just doesn't flow right. The second one almost recreates the entire first film in the first ten minutes. This film just absolutely rocks. Sam Raimi is the master of creepiness, and there are tonsof scenes that will just knock the cobwebs of ya. There is a scene involving a severed head, and it drops down, and, uhh. You have to se it. Bruce Campbell is the king of the universe, but his movie to shine in is really the sequel to this, Army of Darkness (Which is a hilarious film, and Bruce plays the same character.) Bruce plays Ash, who gets stuck in the cabin over night. His girlfriend gets turned into a monster, so he slices and dices her, and his hand gets infected, causing him to need to lop it off. He then attaches a chainsaw and spews one liners at Deadite monstrosities. Classic stuff. If you haven't seen it, see it now, if you have see it again for the heck of it. the new DVD's featres rock, too. Hail to the King Baby.
0517548232|1.0|If you're a right-wing fanatic, you'll love this book. It's all about affirming selfishness and how the rights of big business are much more important than the rights of the individual. Additionally some of his arguments are VERY flawed. For example, he says that there can never really be a trade deficit because American dollars can only be exchanged for American exports. Well Henry, that's not quite true as we learned from the Japanese. American dollars also work quite nicely for buying American real estate and American businesses. It turns out you can do more with a dollar than buy exports. <br />The author also argues that you can not make money by giving away your products, but you can. All you have to do is force your competition out of business by giving away your product until you establish a monopoly. Then you can charge whatever you like. For all his rhetoric about not being short-sighted, he sure mucks it up himself.<br />Although the author has the occasional valid point, most of his arguments are extremely pro-corporation and anti-labor. But hey, it makes a great gift for your favorite reactionary.
B000056V73|4.0|The first time I saw this film I didn't like it at all.  I didn't know what to expect, was apprehensive since its about the early 70s when I was a teen, and was afraid it would bring back too many bad memories.  Yes I do have them.  I also watched it with my mother.  Another fatal mistake.<br />Since then I have watched it probably 4 or 5 times and its really grown on me.  The party Russell and William get invited to by the &quot;regular&quot; every-day kids in the van is very reminiscent of some great parties I went to (except we never had a rock star jump into a pool from the roof of a house).  The song they group sing at the hotel in LA (Something in the Air?), a great choice for that time.  The clothes and hair are true to the times as much as they can be, except for Kate Hudson's hair.  No self-respecting &quot;cool&quot; girl in the early 1970s would have wanted that permed hair look that Kate has.  Sure, that look was cool in the late 70s (Farrah Fawcett gets credit for it) 80s, 90s, and even now, but in the early 70s, cool girls wanted their hair straight (and I mean straight straight) parted in the middle and long.  Want an example?  Check out Sissy Spacek's hair in the movie &quot;Carrie.&quot;  Carrie wasn't cool, but Sissy was.  <br />The Elton John songs from the movie may not seem hip enough to some people now, but Elton was the &quot;king&quot; in the early 70s and his songs were played every where all the time, so its fitting.<br />Cameron Crowe did a very good job of making everything fit the times.  I don't think the casting could have been better.  I still think the &quot;band-aid&quot; groupies are kinda sad.  Crowe shows the ultimate sadness of girls who lived like that through Penny Lane's experience.  But I guess we all live and learn.
B00005RHGK|3.0|It never ceases to amaze me when people claim that horror movies are unrealistic. Of course they are! If you anaylze all movies then about 97% of them are unrealistic and full of holes. Jeepers Creepers tells the tale of a brother and sister coming home from college, when their paths cross that of The Creeper. A supernatural monster who feeds off of humans whenever one of his &quot;parts&quot; start to waver. I'm sure some people will be turned off from the ending, and some will complain that the ending is predictable. But you can't please everyone. As for me, I was satisfied with the ending. Just look out for Jeepers Creepers 2. If you're not sure about this title, I think it's at lease worth the price of a rental.
6302732875|5.0|Those who must rely on their wits to make a living are often prone to desperate measures born of the insecurities inherent in their field of endeavor-- a straight commission salesman, for example; or in this instance, a real estate salesman, in particular.  And under pressure, to what will one in such a position resort to stay afloat when times are tough?  A legitimate question that every consumer would no doubt like to have answered before signing the dotted line and committing some big money to a purchase.  Well, hold tight, because help is on the way, as writer/director David Mamet goes to great lengths to answer it in \\"Glengarry Glen Ross,\\" an unflinching, hard-edged film that examines the motivations of those who would readily and eagerly separate you from more than a few of your hard earned dollars, and whose least concern, apparently, is the value of their product or that parcel of land, which according to them is situated just this side of Shangri-la.  And if you've ever trusted a big-ticket salesman in your life, after visiting Mamet's film, it's doubtful you ever will again.<br /> Very simply, the story is this:  The Company wants results; the hierarchy expects their salesmen to produce, and they don't care how.  Toward that end, a \\"motivator\\" (Alec Baldwin), has been dispatched to this particular office to put things into perspective for those who would sell their wares, as it were.  The deal is, that at the end of a given period of time, the salesman whose name is at the top of the tote board will get a new car; those who fail to meet their quota are out the door.  End of story.  They will, however, be supplied with \\"leads,\\" but from the \\"old\\" file.  The new, \\"fresh\\" leads are reserved for those who first prove themselves worthy, those who can do whatever it takes to make the sale, without qualm, reservation or conscience.  But the prospect of being put on the street in the wake of the give-no-quarter edict only serves to drive one amongst them to an actof desperation-- an irrational act from which there can be no forgiveness and no redemption.  A tough verdict, but then again, nobody said life was going to be easy.<br /> In adapting his own play for the screen, Mamet returns to one of his favorite themes by exploring yet another variation of the \\"con\\" forever being perpetrated somewhere, on someone, in one way or another.  In Mamet's world (in films such as \\"House of Games\\" and the more recent \\"Heist\\") nothing is ever as it seems, and the confidence game is always afoot, the causes and effects of which make up the drama of his stories.  And this film is no exception.  Whether it's the smooth and savvy top-dog of the office, Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), schmoozing a client into handing over a check, or a veteran loser like Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon) showing up at someone's door on a cold call at a most inopportune and inconvenient moment and refusing to leave, Mamet convincingly maintains that the con-is-always-on, and the result-- especially in this film-- is a bleak, but riveting commentary on the human condition, delivered with an intensity that will keep you on the very edge of your emotional seat right up to the end.<br /> The cast Mamet assembled for this offering is superb:  Al Pacino is in top form and extremely effective with a comparatively tempered performance; the scene in which he lulls his customer (played by Jonathan Pryce) into complacency is absolutely hypnotic.  This is the salesman you hope you never encounter, especially if something like the Brooklyn Bridge is being offered, as such overtures as those proffered by Ricky Roma are just too hard to refuse.  And Pacino not only sells it, he closes the deal, as well.<br /> Ed Harris, as Dave Moss, is outstanding, also, creating a character whose bitterness seems to flow from the inside out, and has long since overwhelmed that ability and better part of himself that could've made him a successful salesman, had he but turned his energies to more positive concerns and away from the self-defeating, self-pity into which he has descended.  While at the opposite end of the spectrum is George, played by Alan Arkin, who unlike Dave (who though unable to act upon it, at least had promise at some point in his career) has nothing but insecurity and empty dreams to sustain him.  As wonderfully realized by Arkin, he's the proverbial duck-out-of-water, who belongs anywhere except in a job as a salesman.<br /> The best performance of all, however, is turned in by Jack Lemmon, who in Shelley Levene creates a character so steeped in despair and hopelessness that's it's almost tangible.  You have but to look into Lemmon's eyes to understand the turmoil and depth of Shelley's desperation, and Lemmon successfully conveys the complexities of this man in terms that are believable and incredibly real.  He makes Shelley a guy you can feel for without necessarily sympathizing with him.  It's simply a terrific piece of work by a terrific actor.<br /> Another of the film's strengths is the performance by Kevin Spacey, as John Williamson, the office manager.  It's an understated, but pivotal role, and Spacey does a good job of making it convincing, which ultimately heightens the overall impact of the film, especially the climax. <br /> The supporting cast includes Bruce Altman (Mr. Spannel), Jude Ciccoledda (Detective) and Paul Butler (Policeman).  Mamet builds and sustains a tension throughout this film that drives the anxiety level through the roof; at times, it's exhausting to watch.  In the end, however, \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" is a satisfying experience, involving very real situations with which many in the audience will be able to relate, and delivered with a high-powered energy equal to the subject matter.  And once you catch your breath, it's one you're going to appreciate even more.  It's the magic of the movies.

0425107469|4.0|First off, this is one of the better Koontz novels I've read. It was gripping, fast paced and an extremely good read. If you enjoy Koontz and have not read this one yet, I suggest you give it a run. <BR>Sadly, Konntz does not explore any new ground and the typical Koontz formula is applied to Watchers with a different plot and setting. Down and out characters that are going through problematic times, ex-military is usually involved, a character has some kind of supernatural powers, a love interest is always involved - a kind of mutual healing for both characters, good vs. evil. <BR>For Koontz' formula, this book works, if you are looking for anything new from Dean, I'm not sure where to direct you.
6305508550|5.0|I love this movie.  It has so many individual scenes that are hilarious.  The overall plot and story aren't the greatest, but I've found most people can over look this.<br />This movie is rated R, and I think its one of the tamest R movies I've seen.  There is brief nudity and a fair amount of swearing (mainly in rap music).  However, the R rating may be for the best since I don't think anyone under the driving age will think this movie is all that funny.  It's mainly work related and relationship comedy.  I am thrilled to say there is no &quot;bodily fluid&quot; humor that has been in so many movies lately.<br />The DVD features are almost nonexistant.
B00005RHGK|5.0|JEEPERS CREEPERS    (USA/Germany - 2001)    Aspect ratio: 1.85:1  Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS    Adding its own particular twist to the currently popular teen-horror cycle, JEEPERS CREEPERS - the sleeper hit of 2001, co-produced by Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios - demonstrates how a fairly conventional narrative can be enhanced by the kind of loving care and attention to detail exhibited here by writer-director Victor Salva. His clever, attentive script describes the terrifying experiences of teenage siblings Trish and Darry (played with exceptional warmth and sincerity by attractive newcomers Gina Philips and Justin Long) who are driving home from college when they're terrorized by a demonic creature which initially runs them off a lonely country road. After stumbling into the monster's lair and uncovering it's ghastly secrets (a genuinely heart-stopping set-piece), the kids flee from the monster's wrath, only to be warned by a terrified psychic (an ultra-creepy performance by Patricia Belcher) that the creature has targeted them for a particular reason and won't let them go... ever.    From the dark-hearted drama of NATURE OF THE BEAST (1994) and RITES OF PASSAGE (1998) to the spiritual uplift of POWDER (1995), Salva has always demonstrated a willingness to challenge the conventions of mainstream cinema by thwarting audience expectations at every turn, and JEEPERS CREEPERS is no exception. An avowed fan of old-time monster movies, the director has marshalled his considerable creative resources to produce an equally old-fashioned creature feature, updated for modern sensibilities and characterized by jump-out-of-your-seat thrills, a well-developed sense of irony, and plenty of heart and soul. To top it all off, there's also a pretty impressive monster - a combination of clever makeup, CGI effects, and a truly menacing performance by Jonathan Breck, buried beneath masses of latex and foam rubber.    With nods to an assortment of genre outings, especially DUEL (1971) - which the director happily acknowledges - the film maintains a breathless pace before culminating in a final showdown which capitalizes on the strong emotional undertow established during the opening sequences. In a commentary recorded for the film's original US DVD release, Salva mentioned that he was forced to cut twenty pages from this section of the script for budgetary reasons but, crucially, he doesn't mention what those missing pages contained. Perhaps he's saving them for the forthcoming sequel?    With fabulous, evocative production design by Steven Legler, and equally moody cinematography by frequent Salva collaborator Don E. FauntLeRoy, which transforms the central Florida locations into a Gothic, brooding 21st century dreamscape, the movie's relentless forward momentum allows just enough humor to offset the ultra-convincing trauma suffered by the principal characters as they pit their wits against a merciless force of supernatural horror. However, Salva's normally impeccable judgment is slightly compromised by an unwarranted, needlessly cruel postscript: Having staged a predictably lavish, crowd-pleasing finale that scales the heights of operatic tragedy, Salva chooses to close proceedings with a downbeat coda that's actually more depressing than horrific, and seems completely out of tune with the Big Fun Monster Movie that precedes it. It's the only significant flaw in an otherwise perfectly realized miniature.    Followed by JEEPERS CREEPERS II (2002).
6303407188|4.0|Whatever deficiencies Burton's biopic may have as a film are readily compensated for by a subject matter, script, and style so cinematically evocative that the viewer is apt to sense he's seeing many other films at the same time.  Burton captures the fanaticism in every true movie fan, the sheer exhilaration experienced by the lover of movies of every artistic level, the driven exhuberance and enthusiasm that unite the best directors and their audiences.<br />The posters in Woods' office--of &quot;Kane,&quot; &quot;Dracula,&quot; and numerous grade B movies--range from the sublime to the ridiculous, each betraying their owner's undiscriminating passion for films and his compulsive need to complete his projects.  At one point he meets the great Orson Welles (an uncanny impersonation by Vincent D'Onofrio) who, like Wood, is struggling to finance his latest project--&quot;Don Quixote,&quot; of all things!<br />&quot;All visions are worth fighting for,&quot; Welles counsels Wood, who takes the advice to heart.  Sharp enough to know the greatness of &quot;Kane&quot; even in the fifties and smart enough to quote Coleridge's definition of imaginative art as &quot;the willing suspension of disbelief,&quot; Wood remains oblivious to the fact that his movies are fooling no one--except himself.  He watches them repeatedly and uncritically, mouthing each word of atrocious dialogue, shedding tears of pathos and joy, and always shaking his head in disbelief at the wonder of his own illusions.<br />It's easy to see why Tim Burton would be drawn to a project such as this, and Burton's own attraction to the surfaces of the medium, to the light and shadow of the projected image, and his eye for the off-beat make him a creative and spiritual descendant of Ed Wood.  And Ed, like every great director from Eisenstein to Burton himself, understands the very essence of cinema.  It's not about the &quot;reality&quot; documented by the camera: it's about the creative, imaginative, inventive mixing and matching of strips of celluloid.  Early in the film he makes the claim, &quot;I could make an entire movie of stock footage.&quot;<br />Many directors could, and have.  But Ed is represented by Burton as being uncritical and fanatical about his projects to the point of being utterly and fatally careless as well.  He's energetic, relentless, generous, but never exacting.  The &quot;details&quot; don't matter, he tells his crew and producers on &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space.&quot;  And so his failures, though no less resounding, are at least free of cynicism and are fueled by a vision of cinema in which the viewer's imagination can be counted on to replace verisimilitude.  Wood brings to film-making a kind of free-spirited, carefree vision that disciplined film-makers like Burton know can never succeed with a public insisting that film simulate, and not merely symbolize, reality.<br />My only reservation about Burton's impressive tribute is the casting of Johnny Depp as Ed Wood.  Depp is a skilled, off-center actor and somewhat of a cult Hollywood figure himself.  But Depp's adolescent voice and youthful appearance almost suggest a star-struck, recent teenager going for broke against all odds--a common, familiar theme throughout our culture.  Wood, on the other hand, was an innocent, enchanted child-creature in a grown man's body.  He's the amateur in us all, including those of us who might fit the description of a middle-aged yuppie in possession of nothing more than a camcorder, an iMac movie editing program, and a dream.mixing and matching of strips of celluloid.

6305364613|4.0|It's common to update Shakespeare, and this is a nice adaptation.  The filmmakers are trying to say that the themes and feelings in R &amp; J are universal and timeless, and the story is updated well to make that work.  I especially like the opening scene:  Shakespeare often opened with a clown to make the audience pay attention--the director here opens with a punk rock clown-hair colored thug.  Nice in-joke.<br />I take a star away because, although I don't mind EDITING Shakespeare, I have some problems that the lines were put in the wrong order.  One, in particular (&quot;The drugs are quick&quot;) moved from the death scene at the end to the party scene at the beginning--changing its meaning and altering perception of both scenes.
B00004U8P9|3.0|More turns out to be less in the case of this double DVD edition of 1975's &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show,&quot; a charming if innocuous and uneven spoof of horror and sci-fi B movies with a rock n' roll, gender-bender twist.  The whole point of the Rocky Horror phenomenon was the participatory role of the audience, not the movie, which is as much of a period piece as the movies it attempts to send up.  The extra disc in this set includes a lengthy, turgid, humorless documentary about the making of the play and the movie, with interviews of the director, writer, producer, and various actors--practically everyone associated with the show except the most important contributors--the audiences whose &quot;appearances&quot; in the production easily exceeded those of the actual performers.<br />We are unlikely to witness anything like the Rocky Horror cult phenomenon again.  In Western theater as well as mainstream movies the role of the audience is generally passive, isolated, private and voyeuristic.  Only in the Dionysian theater of ancient Greece or the cult rituals described by Antonin Artaud in &quot;Theater and Its Double&quot; do we learn about a kind of theater that amounted to a communal celebration of the daemonic, a liturgical worship with the audience as active celebrants.  But &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; rewrote the rules or, perhaps more accurately, the audiences themselves invented a new form of movie, in effect &quot;producing&quot; the 20-year-run of a happening known, for lack of a better title, as the &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show.&quot;<br />Throw away the documentary disc and set the movie's alternate sound track to &quot;audience,&quot; easily the feature that makes the DVD the one to own rather than the VHS version.  Now what you have is at best a reminder of a singular party that ended the instant it became a mass-produced commodity.

B00005QDW5|3.0|I knew what I was purchasing before I purchased this CD set, and expected the songs not to flow as a Pink Floyd album should. However, I do notice at least some attempt by the band to make these flow together in some sort of meaningful way. At least some of them partially do, it takes some imagination though. <BR> Anyway, I have two main complaints here. First, leaving out many better songs which should have been included. Second, cutting short the most passionate and powerful guitar solo by Dave in Echoes. You know what I mean if you know the &quot;real&quot; Echoes from Meddle. I was all into Dave's solo, as it built towards it's climax, then, suddenly, it ends and the groove section begins? What is that all about? <BR> Now, Shine On, I have heard many shortened versions of this particular song, and all are quite good, so I can't complain too much about that one being cut short here. But the complete version on the Wish You Were Here album is still the &quot;real&quot; thing.<BR> One last thing! The inclusion of Sheep, instead of Dogs, is in my opinion a mistake. Dogs, as everyone knows, has the famous dual guitar solo, with a third answering back. It's one of Dave's best solos, which should have been included I think. The songs from the Final Cut are good, but it should have included also &quot;Gunner's Dream&quot;, which is a powerful poetic piece. Also, make note that unlike a lot of bands, Pink Floyd almost always sound better live, so check out their live material, it's great stuff. <BR> The &quot;rocking&quot; classics from Pink Floyd are mysteriously missing here also, except for One of These Days, which thankfully is included. Run Like Hell, Mother, and Young Lust, should have been included.<BR> Do yourself a favor and purchase ALL of the Pink Floyd albums individually, that way, you get the entire story and message from each.
B000004286|5.0|As far as I am concerned, the best original scores ever written are 'Gladiator', 'Last of the Mohicans', 'Titanic', 'Star Wars', and of course, 'Braveheart'.  This breathtakingly celtic score is sure to capture your imagination and take you away to Scotland.  James Horner makes great use of bagpipes, harps, and some other folk instruments.  'Bravehearts' score has a wonderful natural feel to it, as if this music could have really been there during the story.<br />James Horner is most well known for his Academy Award Winning score for the critically acclaimed 'Titanic'.  If you enjoyed the 'Titanic' score, you'll love this.  The same drama and emotion is present and you may be faintly reminded of the 'Titanic' score after hearing this.  Remember, 'Braveheart's' score came before 'Titanic's'!<br />James Horner creates some absolutely stunning and memorable themes here which are reused throughout the score.  From the tender and emotional 'A Gift of Thistle' to the upbeat and dramatic 'The Battle of Stirling', James Horner manages to set the mood with his compositions.  These pieces are all abosolutely stunning, you won't find yourself skipping over any of them as you usually must do with scores!  I usually choose a few favorites when reviewing a score, but I find that I cannot with 'Braveheart's!  If you have not seen the film, YOU MUST!  And YOU MUST purchase this stunning piece of work, one of the finest scores ever!
B00005TT77|1.0|I'm surprised by all the gushing about this album. To me, it is a really, really bland collection of music. Most of these versions do not sound all THAT different from the originals ... they're just worse, that's all. The Black Crowes doing Lucy in the Sky with Daimonds is hilarious in its wretchedness.<br />To me, the lone exceptional track in this collection of junk is Grandaddy's Revolution. It's an interesting version--kinda strange and refreshingly surprising ... which is something I CANNOT say for anything else here.
0671027344|5.0|I read this book last year, when i went to a very sheltered catholic jr high school where even a a whisper of suicide or death would get you detention. This book made me realize how horrible this was for a child maturing into adulthood, who would soon have to face the real world. The fact that the main character, Charlie, is so open and trusting that he tells all and holds nothing back, helps the reader find somthing to identify with. Through this book I gained an understanding of an individuals growth and the obstacles they encounter. The reader of this novel (if around the age of Charlie) realizes that the words of Steven Chbosky are exactly how they feel, and exactly what they are going through. A new outlook on the world may be developed from what you learn from this book, if you just take the time to think about its meaning and the connections to everyday life.
B00005OAIE|4.0|What a breath of fresh air this album is. Indeed it is a feel-good CD about life, love and longing that doesn't require an explicit lyrics label. It's a body of work that will take up residency in yout CD player for weeks on end. Mayer is a fresh singer-songwriter worthy of a listen, or two, or three. Compare his sound to Dave Matthews or Michael Franks.  I caught wind of his tune &quot;83&quot; on the Serendipity soundtrack and wondered if the rest of the CD would measure up to this cut about times when he was small, and it did.&quot;Neon&quot; is another great song on Mayer's album that will become familiar to the repeat button on your stereo.Even if it's not your usual genre of music, you'll find yourself singing his songs when the CD is off. Mayer may be an newcomer to the mainstream, but he's on his way to becoming a household name.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|The only thing that remotely saved this piece of tripe was some decent gravy.  Costumes and cinematography were lush and creative.  The story was almost worthy of the visuals, but the overall camp level was beyond Rocky Horror.  And at least Rocky Horror can boast original music.

HAUNTING ME is the best song on the CD.  SOMETIMES IT HURTS is really good too.  If you dont have this CD, pick it up-this is one of the most underrated groups out there.

B00003CXRP|3.0|Being led into a deception is annoying enough.  Leading yourself down some primrose path to confront disappointment is downright awkward.  &quot;Tom Hanks&quot; must mean this will be a film worth investment, right?  Wrong on nearly all counts.  Tom Hanks is a fine actor.  He does a memorable job in this film.  He conveys the agony of isolation with lively intensity.  The viewer shares his struggles with sympathy as he draws you into his daily acts of survival.  Hanks is a superb actor.  The pity is the material he's been given to work with.  No matter how adroitly he conveys the desire to survive in isolation, carrying the memory of his  abandoned love, Helen Hunt, the film is predictable from start to finish.  There isn't a single surprise in this latest entry in Hollywood's Robinson Crusoe sweepstakes.<br />The transformation of a shallow man into someone bringing hidden abilities to bear on a difficult situation is a favourite Hollywood theme.  If it's done well, we can all identify with the individual.  This is Hanks' special talent.  He's done it elsewhere, and he does it superbly here.  A mid-level executive in the FedEx courier firm, he operates under a compulsion to succeed.  He does it by driving others to match his pace.  Thrown on his own resources on a lonely Pacific island, Chuck Noland must develop new skills and strengths.  They're not readily forthcoming as Hanks expresses so well.  When he finds FedEx packages from the wrecked aircraft, his hesitation at opening them is manifest.  It must be the ultimate transgression for a FedEx employee.  Ludicrous as the discovery of ice skates seems, of course they prove valuable tools on the island.  The transformation of another find, a volleyball, into his alter ego is pure Hanks.  He carries the film in splendid isolation.<br />That isolation, given the cast, is this film's greatest shortcoming.  Bringing Helen Hunt into this film in &quot;bookend&quot; scenes at the beginning and end is to do an outstanding actress a great disservice.  Instead, we are given Bill Broyles' experiences in survival schools imparted through Tom Hanks.  Had Zemekis goaded Broyles into broader vision, this film might have been redeemed.  Hunt could have portrayed her grief at his loss and whatever led her to follow the path ultimately revealed.  Slipping from the level of work he achieved in earlier films, Broyles here slips into simplistic and trite formulas.  Hanks calls &quot;I'll be right back!&quot; to Hunt before entering the aircraft.  Did any viewer doubt they wouldn't see each other until the film approached its finale?  Worse, the caption &quot;Four Years Later&quot; flashes on the screen and you know what must inevitably follow.  Hunt's other &quot;bookend&quot; appearance begins with her fainting, a totally inappropriate event for someone who exudes strength.  Even relaxed, Hunt couldn't assume a &quot;shrinking violet&quot; role, yet Broyles forces that unlikely role here.<br />If you're a Hanks fan, this is a film to view once.  If you're a Hunt fan, you may enjoy the brevity of her appearance, which is hardly to her credit.  If you want a captivating story, well presented and rich with innovation, you'll be only partly satisfied.  Watch it once and pass it on.  Anyone wishing to own a copy may contact this reviewer for a bargain deal.  Perhaps you could also explain why the film's title is incorrect grammar.  &quot;Cast Away&quot; is the action of someone disposing something.  &quot;Castaway&quot; is what Tom Hanks plays.ing actress a great disservice.  Instead, we are given Bill Broyles' experiences in survival schools imparted through Tom Hanks.  Had Zemekis goaded Broyles into broader vision, this film might have been redeemed.  Hunt could have portrayed her grief at his loss and whatever led her to follow the path ultimately revealed.  Slipping from the level of work he achieved in earlier films, Broyles here slips into simplistic and trite formulas.  Hanks calls &quot;I'll be right back!&quot; to Hunt before entering the aircraft.  Did any viewer doubt they wouldn't see each other until the film approached its finale?  Worse, the caption &quot;Four Years Later&quot; flashes on the screen and you know what must inevitably follow.  Hunt's other &quot;bookend&quot; appearance begins with her fainting, a totally inappropriate event for someone who exudes strength.  Even relaxed, Hunt couldn't assume a &quot;shrinking violet&quot; role, yet Broyles forces that unlikely role here.<br />If you're a Hanks fan, this is a film to view once.  If you're a Hunt fan, you may enjoy the brevity of her appearance, which is hardly to her credit.  If you want a captivating story, well presented and rich with innovation, you'll be only partly satisfied.  Watch it once and pass it on.  Anyone wishing to own a copy may contact this reviewer for a bargain deal.  Perhaps you could also explain why the film's title is incorrect grammar.  &quot;Cast Away&quot; is the action of someone disposing something.  &quot;Castaway&quot; is what Tom Hanks plays.

0783117388|5.0|The Sex and the City-The Complete First Season is a great item for those who don't have cable TV (unlike me). I get HBO just to watch these shows. Most of the year I don't have HBO, but when June comes, I rush to get it. I have all of the first, second, and third season on tape, but this is a great gift idea for friends. I will probably buy this for one of my family and friends for birthdays or holidays (just to get them as addicted as I am). The great thing about this show is that every woman can see a little bit of herself in every one of the characters. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is the character I most relate to because of her fashion sense and her personality (very similar to mine). Samantha (Kim Catrall) is the woman that most women vilify, but wish they were like. She is so bold, daring and downright outrageous. There is a little Samantha in everyone. Miranda is the workaholic of the bunch who seeks perfection in everyone and everything. She is bold like Samantha, but in a different way. Charlotte is the one who you find endearing. Her search for her Prince Charming with a Madison Avenue job and Park Avenue apartment is something to watch. She goes through so many frogs, it is hilarious to watch. <br />This is the season that all of the newer fans must see. The first season gives insight into each of the four main characters (it relies more on the book (written by Candace Bushnell-a great read) in its descriptions of the characters ). It includes the beginning of the relationship of Carrie &amp; Mr. Big and the first break-up (to be followed in the next few seasons by many more). It also includes the many misadventures of Miranda, which makes this season all the funnier. Samantha is at her vampiest. Charlotte is not as prudish and judgemental in this season (something to see). It may not be the best season of the show (which is season 3), but remember there would not be a show without this season.<br />This show has all of the elements that keep you tuningin. This is a must buy for fans of the later seasons. Buy it!!!
B00005N9CV|5.0|Don't believe the critics on this one--it is a stone gorgeous<BR>and tasteful album, may even be her best (and that's saying something given<BR>&quot;Love Scenes&quot; and &quot;All For You&quot;.)  Those who call<BR>it jazz muzak or elevator music--get some ears.  It may or <BR>may not be &quot;pure jazz&quot; for purists, but it takes jazz back to<BR>where it ought to be--in people's homes and lives.  She is<BR>perhaps closest to a female Sinatra in this CD, which reminds<BR>me in some way of Sinatra's slower concept albums such as<BR>&quot;In The Wee Small Hours&quot;.  The orchestration is beautiful, and, yes, there is plenty <BR>of jazz for those able to hear it.  Sorry,<BR>critics, if you don't like her versions of &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;<BR>and &quot;The Night We Called It a Day&quot;, get the wax out of your ears<BR>and listen to what the woman is saying.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana, most people view them as the Beatles of the 90's and they have good reason to, they created and led the genre of grunge to the masses. Back in the early 1990's most American teenagers were looking for a reason to not care, for a new sound to fuel their \\"ignorance is bliss\\" philosophy, and Nirvana answered the call. When \\"Smells like teen spirit\\" hit the airwaves it was a pure rush of adrenaline, something no one had ever heard before and it changed everything. Out with the 80's hair bands, in with the grunge heads and punk rockers, to this day one can not deny Nirvana's influence. Front man and legend Kurt Cobain became the modern day John Lennon, backed by incredible lyrical genius and a modest personality. <br />But I suppose you have heard enough of my rambling, here is what you came for, the review of \\"Nevermind\\". Wow...what words can really describe it I can't seem to bring to mind right now, in all honesty though it is AMAZING. Even to this day Nirvana is held in the highest regards, many times being compared to groups like The Beatles, The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Led Zeppelin. Many people have even had the nerve to call this album \\"pop\\"...Well if you are going to say that, you might as well call the Beatles long time pop icons instead of rock n' roll legends. Every rock fan should own this album, if you don't it's not a crime...But it sure as hell isn't a good thing either.
0440219078|5.0|No one can truly review this book because it has many meanings within it that speak differently to different personalities. This is a beautifull book that for most, helps them realize that they shouldnt take things for granted. To some this is religious. To some it is a fake story that would never happen in real life, when some see this as real life painted itno a story. Anyone should read this book because it will open your mind to new thoughts.
0060278234|5.0|A wonderful new story that is told in the Old Kingdom. This story revolves around Lirael, a daughter of Clayr. There is only one problem; she doesn't have the Sight. At 14 it's unheard of for a daughter of the Clayr to not have the Sight. Well, that's not the only problem... her mother has left her and she doesn't know who her father is, and she doesn't look like ANY of the Clayr.   Though this story centers around Lirael, it is also has a sub-plot about Sabriel's son (if you don't know who Sabriel is, you should read \\"Sabriel\\" first.) Sabriel's son, Sam, is not the perfect Abhorsen that he thinks he should be, but the last thing he wants to do is disappoint his parents, and going into Death. This is an intriguing story filled with twists, but it alsot deals a lot with destiny, and what you are made to do.  Although I dislike the thought of destiney, I still liked this book.  I'm waiting not so patiently for the next book in the series, Abhorsen.
6300214540|4.0|This is sometimes seen as a typical 1980s film, making the name of Tom Cruise and featuring typically 1980s themes. Military men (compare with the dozens of Vietnam films) in smart white uniforms (An Officer And A Gentleman) fall for women with bad hairstyles. But this is really a film out of time. There is apparently a war going on with an un-named country (the implication is that it is the USSR), and this war is necessary to give any credibility to the dangers these top flyers face. This film feels as though it should have been set in 1943, with war-time themes of pilots on leave, garrison towns, and the 'first of the few' spirit suffusing the whole thing. Having set the story in the 1980s, however, the flying scenes are all handled skilfully and effectively, my only criticism being that it is difficult to see what is going on sometimes, especially with the stars' faces hidden behind flight helmets. One thing that is particularly 1980s, however is the soundtrack. Giorgio Moroder rarely puts a foot wrong, and some of his best work is on show here in the Oscar-winning Take My Breath Away.<br />Anthony Edwards gives a great performance but it's a pity he is in the shadow of Tom Cruise throughout as he deserves more. The two ladies in their lives are played by a young Meg Ryan and Kelly McGillis, both being believable in the roles they play. If I had one criticism, it would be that too much time is spent in the air with 'planes, whereas the real drama is on the ground between humans

630027179X|5.0|John Boorman says that he made his design staff watch Terry Gilliam's Jabberwocky over and over again to get the correct atmosphere for this piece, and it shows. This is about as realistic and dirty as grail romances get, with an amoral Merlin played meticulously by Nicol Williamson, Nigel Terry's Arthur with feet of Clay, and a sinning and repentant Lancelot played by Nicholas Clay. John Boorman also proves that he knows how to spot talent, with support from Patrick Stewart, Gabriel Byrne and Liam Neeson all lending this movie gravitas and quality. The story is cleverly adapted from Arthurian romance, taking liberties here and there, but entirely in keeping with the tradition of such storytelling.<br />A beautiful film you will want to watch time and time again. It's a shame there are no extras on the DVD

6305263248|2.0|'Ronin' is a perpetuum mobile of action set-pieces, pursuit and flight, by car or on foot.  Fans were delighted that in an age of limitless technological gadgetry, the tough, narrow, 70s-style crime thriller could still find a place, where speeding cars genuinely terrorised crowded streets, where market barrows were set up to be knocked down, where ancient monuments and picturesque old lanes gave a Hitchcockian frisson to the various chases.  The dank and dark atmosphere, the shorthand psychology, the terse dialogue and tough poses all added to a nostaliga of integrity harking bak to 'Bullit' and 'The French Connection'.  It didn't seem to matter that the various plot points necessary to drive and tidy up the plot were preposterously contrived; that the backdrop of Russians and rogue-IRA operatives was closer to cartoon than James Bond ever was; that grimaces and twitches were substituted for actual acting (with the honorable eception of Jonathan Pryce who, despite borrowing his Irish accent from Julia Roberts, has a genius moment when long-wished for success is interrupted).  <br />Not only does the film recall 'classic' 70s policiers, but also the film that influenced them, Melville's 'Le Samourai', as it transposes Japanese warrior culture to pastiche film noir.  Here, however, the Orientalism seems tacked on, the idea of 'masterless samurai' a nonsense not fully worked out in its 'modernised' context, and 'explained' by one silly dialogue scene between De Niro and an againg Matt Groening-lookalike, which suggests the screenwriters weren't totally convinced either.  No, it is Melville's master whose spirit drives this film, John Huston: 'Ronin' is a study in male endeavour, female treachery and the elevation of failure to a moral code.  It's watchable enough, but it feels very tired.

0061053147|5.0|'Future Noir', also known affectionately as 'The Bible' among Blade Runner fans is a very thorough examination all aspects of this groundbreaking film. <br />Written by Paul M. Sammon, the book takes us through the making of the film, the initial screenings and subsequent release, interviews with the cast and crew, the special effects, mistakes and problems with the film, the question of &quot;Is Deckard a replicant?&quot; and much, much more. This book is very much a reference book so it can be read in almost any order and referred to when you have questions that need answering. <br />The book provides some very interesting little insights into the film. One example, revealed during an interview with M. Emmet Walsh, is that Ridley Scott said that Walsh's character, Harry Bryant, had a stomach problem. This is the reason why he pours two shots for Deckard in his office and none for himself. He likes to see other people drinking since he can not.<br />The book is quite long and goes into a lot of detail, particularly in the section dealing with special effects. If you're not interested in such things it can be skipped over, however I am happy that it was included. It is better to have too much information than not enough. One thing that bothers me a bit is the fact that shortly before the book was to be published the publisher cut almost 300 pages of material from the book. This left Sammon scrambling to figure out what to cut and where to put important information from those deleted chapters in the book. There is talk of republishing the book in an expanded, more heavily illustrated version in 2002, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of Blade Runner's original release, but whether this will happen is not yet clear. A deleted chapter from the book about the BR crew has been made available online on the website 2019: Off World. Do a search on Yahoo! for 'Blade Runner' and you'll find it.<br />The book also contains appendices outlining the many versions of the film, the soundtracks and many other useful tidbits of information.<br />To sum up, this is a great book. It is a must for die-hard BR fans and for anyone who is interested in delving a little deeper into the mythology of Blade Runner.
B00005QK3W|4.0|I bought the CD the day it came out.  I've been a Macca fan since the late 70s.  I think it is a good album, though I think its not as good as Flowers in the Dirt or Flaming Pie.  I would rank Flaming Pie as his best post-beatle album with Band on the Run second.  My favorite tune on the album is 'Shes given up talkin' A really good tune and very unlike macca.  &quot;Riding into Jaipur&quot; was very Harrison like...perhaps an uncouncious tribute to his &quot;...baby brother&quot;.  George would have liked it and probably did.  I wonder what Paul thought of Ringo's son Zak playing drums for the Who at the New York concert.  Anyway a good album overall, the man still has the touch.

B00005QIPH|5.0|This is the best CD I've purchased since OK Computer.  While, I wouldn't compare the two musically, they are both equally addictive.  I was not able to remove OK Computer from my stereo for 2 months and, so far, &quot;Is This It&quot; looks like it's going to be in HEAVY rotation for a long time as well.  Every track on this CD is excellent.  So far each one has spent at least one day in my &quot;best track of the CD&quot; column.  If you like unique stuff, get this CD.  It's a hell of a lot better than any other new band out there.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Oh my God! I love this movie! Admittedly I am a Python addict, owning all of their first season as well as some other python related items(ie the cardinals cape and a dish rack)But I must say this my absolute favorite(excluding of course the dishrack, as it is both fun AND functional). On that note, this movie is definately one of the funiest ever made, and if you don't like it, tough! From the rather rude frenchman(&quot;your mother was hamster and your father smelt of elderberries&quot;), to the ballad of Sir Robin, you won't stop laughing, or if you do, it will be from something other than this movie.

1570427496|4.0|Having intensely disliked the author's former novel, &quot;Message in a Bottle,&quot; I was very surprised to find out how much I enjoyed this book on tape.  I actually listened to the full version, not the unabridged, from RecordedBooks (that is not read by the author) so I can't comment on Nicholas Sparks' own recording.  However, the version I did listen to was entertaining, sweet and sad.  The main character of Landon Carter is a bit naive but this is set in the 1950's, not today.  Teenagers were nicer and more trusting 40 years ago.  The main character of Jamie Sullivan is a cross between Joan of Arc and Melanie Wilkes and manages to get exactly what she wants without ever being demanding.  She is a very &quot;good&quot; person as the author tells us over and over again.  Landon is actually the more interesting of the two people because he does go through somewhat of a life change and matures by the end of the book. <br />The audio is not long - about 5 tapes - and worth listening to if you get a chance.

B000002I27|4.0|These songs were a continuation of the dark themes from the debut album. There was more of an experimental and psychedelic feel replacing the live garage band sound on the previous record. One could sense that the stronger batch of songs were picked for the first album, and leftovers were used for this one. Despite that, there are still six gems that clock around or less than three minutes that are not played on the radio, (tracks 1,2,4,6,8,and 9). Among those are mysterious ballads such as You're Lost Little Girl, and rockers like My Eyes Have Seen You, of which Black Sabbath partially ripped off the riff in 1970(the song was N.I.B). The Top 40 Hits on the album include Strange Days(#12), and Love Me Two Times(#25). The remaining two tracks are perhaps the least accessible. Horse Latitudes, a demented albeit humorous poetry recital, is somewhat of a throwaway track, and When the Music's Over, another rather pretentious yet successful mixture of poetry and music, in the mold of The End, including better variation in the instrumentation. After obtaining the first album, this is a good companion record, although it falls short of it's predecessor in both length (35 minutes to the debut's 44), and overall quality, though the high points are among the band's best work.
B00005NWRS|2.0|This is not a bad record it just isn't that good.It comes across as an Alt country by numbers record without the touching (if a little hackneyed) songs that made Adams's name on &quot;heartbreaker&quot;.Even the title &quot;Gold &quot; is hardly inpired?<BR>You'd be better off with a Wilco or  early 1970's late 60's Rolling Stones record from which he has taken so much and made so little.It is interesting to note that the record was produced by Ethan Johns, the son of sometime Stones producer Glynn Johns and features Chris Stills son of etc..I think this kind of thinking is what holds Adams back as he has an obvious talent.

B000058983|5.0|Everybody wants to show off by showing their superior love for this essential yet supposedly obscure relic by Arthur Lee and Love. Let us now close the book. It is the greatest album ever, better than Sgt. Pepper or Are You Experienced or Pet Sounds. But, as all these reviews prove, it is no longer obscure among people who like good music. Perhaps Love was not sufficiently lauded during the sixties, such that even &quot;authentic&quot; hippies might have missed them the first time around, but that was largely because the band was anti-social and refused to tour or promote themselves. Arthur Lee was a brilliant musician, a visionary, and a cult figure among those who want to synthesize and expand upon everything they love about Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and John Lennon. So we all love Love. Those few people who don't know forever changes (much less Da Capo, and (my secret affection) the eponymous first album) may be stray sheep, but they must not be shephered into fanhood. Isn't the greatest part about Love the fact that we all discovered them &quot;by ourselves?&quot; Agreed? Enough. (Though might I recommend as a rival to this album &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; by the Zombies?) Also, a truly obscurantist, pretentious Love fan will invariably cite &quot;Flowers&quot; as his favourite rolling stones album. Enjoy.

6300147630|3.0|This breakthrough from cult director David Cronenberg sees a tramp suddenly discover that he is a 'scanner', a person that can read and control minds.  This eventually transcends into a struggle between the good scanners and the bad.  Underneath this there's a neat little romantic interest which is underplayed effectively and an early version of the evils of genetic manipulation.<br />There are some highly impressive special effects, good acting and some fantastic set pieces - especially a modern artist's studio.  Although often advertised as a gore fest, it's not really too bad until the end.  However, when you do reach the end, it is incredibly gory, so be warned.  The ending itself is generally impressive though.<br />Still, at the end of the day, this is impressive for its genre but it's not really my thing.  If you like movies of this sort then you'll probably love this, which is remarkably fresh to say it was released during the 1970's.

What you may not know is what a fantastic DVD package this is.<br />1. Picture quality is unbelievable.<br />2. It will take you hours to get through all of the additional material, and with the exception of a feature on an Episode I video game, all of it is worthwhile if you're at all interested in this movie or the Star Wars series in general. Only complaint: there's some overlap of material among all the various features/documentaries.<br />3. The menus are clear, intuitive, and attractive.  It's nice to see some real care taken in the menu design.<br />4. The &quot;commentary mode&quot; is the most consistently clear and informative example I've heard. No idle, disjointed chit-chat here.<br />If you're sitting on the fence, buy this.  It won't make you like Jar-Jar, or the sometimes clunky dialogue, but this is what all DVD packages should aspire to.

0060916540|3.0|Reading 'Touching the Void' by Joe Simpson I was left with some very strong impressions, most of which are probably not what the author intended.  Firstly, the book is full of jargon not used outside of the niche world of climbers; I found myself looking up many words in the dictionary (hint to Simpson: how about having a glossary in the next edition of the book?).  Secondly, the book reads like nothing more than a collection of glib diary entries.  Fine for the likes of Anne Frank, but this book would have been a better if written by someone else (hint to Simpson: climbing mountains and writing books don't mix).  Lastly, I am ASTOUNDED at how such an obviously intelligent man like Joe Simpson got himself into such a horrific mess climbing a mountain ... with the end result he is left with injuries he'll live (and suffer) with the rest of his life.  I did NOT get the feeling &quot;gee Joe, you're one helluva survivor&quot;.  You shouldn't have gotten into the life-threatening situation in the first place.<br />For those who haven't guessed, this book is the real-life adventure of Joe Simpson as he and a friend climb an icy peak in South America.  Even though both individuals have climbing experience, both acted wrecklessly (IMHO) whilst on the climb.  Joe suffers a serious fall and, no doubt enduring pain that perhaps only a holocaust victim can relate to, manages to make it back on his own.  Inspiring?  No doubt for some, but not so for this reader.<br />Bottom line: the book delivers both &quot;how not to climb mountains&quot; and &quot;never, EVER give up&quot; messages.  Unfortunately it is not well-written.  Perhaps best left to climbers and, more so, wannable climbers.

B00003CXB7|5.0|1970 was the year Hollywood went to war with War Movies!!  Patton (WWII Europe), Tora Tora Tora (WWII Japan & Pearl Harbor) and M.A.S.H. (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital - Korean War).  The first 2 were high budget, Star Studded and on location.  Mash was low budget, unknown cast and filmed on the Universal Ranch.<br />MASH became the sleeper hit of 1970 receiving 5 Oscar nominations and winning 1 (Best Screenplay).<br />This 2 DVD disk digitally remastered Widescreen (Letterbox)set has an extensive history and background information about the Korean War, Mash Units and the people who served during these difficult times.<br />Actually MASH was an Anti-War film against the Vietnam War, but was done very effectively to be a very Dark Comedy in a war time environment.  With the Humane Medical Teams showing the carnage of War through surgery and the horror of war and death.  The movie conveys the story, cast and war time setting very effectively so we can enjoy the black humor, sex and horror.  We get the message wihout the anti-protesters in our face.  We see how war destroys us one way or another.<br />Summary: The 4077th M.A.S.H. Unit is stationed 3 miles form the Korean front lines.  The Cast of characters are drafted Medical Personell that find a way of serving and existing in this environment through humor, defying authority, sex and friendships.  This movie is fast paced, a highly intense drama/comedy which allows us to enter the combat front through the humanity of medicine and the miracle of life.  The cast is outstanding!  <br />You must see this movie.  It is a historical statement of 1970 and it remains a timeless classic!  After all, in 1972 a TV series evolved and remained in our lives for 11 seasons and now in reruns.  Enjoy.

0380796090|5.0|I hope my words will be able to adequately describe my surprise and pleasure when I discovered this book. It was totally by accident. Where has this author been all my life. She has many more and I plan to hunt down everyone of them. This book has over 400 wonderful pages. It's a page turner. The humor is great, and so are everyone of the characters. Her family, the husband and even a few off beat surprises. It kept me going right up to the end. I salute you Ms. Keyes you are a excellent writer. I'm glad I make my own decisions on what books to read because Oprah has missed another winner! Thanks for the good time I had with your book. I'll miss you Claire, Helen, Anna, Mum, Dad, Adam and even James.
3438052199|4.0|This is \\"BHS,\\" the edition that most Christian seminaries require for courses that require the original-language text. It's a reliable text.<br />Granted, neither the BHS text nor the idealized Massoretic Text is problem-free. Still, take the \\"critical apparatus,\\" the notes at the bottom of each page, with a grain of salt. They represent work by mostly Christian scholars from the 1600's CE to today, who have been trying to reduce the number of \\"text problems.\\" The work will remain debatable until Judgement Day. Pay attention to your \\"Exegetical Methods for Hebrew\\" professor, and read about textual criticism.<br />Also, the text layout in BHS has some annoying features.<br />...If you must use BHS for your seminary course, get BHS. The small edition is easy to carry to class; the large edition is easier on the eyes.
0385484518|5.0|I love this book.  I didn't put it down once I started until I finished the whole book.  This is a great book that touches your heart.  Although most of the lessons that the author tries to convey are nothing new, he still does a very good in touching a reader's heart, let it be love between a teacher and a student, love between husband and wife, love between brothers, love between father and son.  This book is not an lengthier version of your ordinary 'chicken soup' stories but rather a very well put together piece of work.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I thought that the movie was great.At first when he wanted to go back to the drain pipe I thought that no one would do that but when he said that if that were you wouldn't you like someone to help I sympathized with what he said.The first time I didn't get that the tag that said beatingu was b eating u.It was entertaining and I loved the cast.
6304143184|5.0|E.T. is an excellent movie that was a real joy to watch and definitely a feel good movie, I liked all the actors in this movie but I especially liked Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore. I havent watched our video in a long time but it's definitely a movie I could watch again and not be bored watching it again. I very highly recommend this awesome movie!
6305428220|4.0|After Scream there was The Faculty....and what a masterpiece by Kevin Williamson. This movie takes the brilliance of Scream but creates a new formula. Instead of stalk n slash teen terror we have a high school being taken over by aliens and the terror of not knowing who's an alien and who isn't. It has a killer cast including Elijah Wood as the cute Geek, Josh Hartnett as the cool bad boy and Jordana Brewster as the popular girl. The teachers are walking the halls preying on students but some of the students have other ideas how to battle them before they are the only normal people left. Well done Robert Rodriguez and Kevin Williamson!!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Let me start off by being very honest.  I never intended to watch this movie because of all the bad critic reviews and because it starred Ben Affleck (sorry, I'm not a fan of his).  Anyway, I went to my father-in-law's one day with my husband and had actually taken some needlework to do while he worked on his computer. My father-in-law offered to let me watch the movie and so as to not hurt his feelings I said sure, I'd watch it.  I must tell you I was in for a big surprise.  About fifteen minutes into the movie my needwork was forgotten.  I was completely absorbed in this movie.<br />I don't understand all the negative reviews.  Come on people, the movie isn't that bad.  Everybody compares it to Saving Private Ryan.  Newsflash...  this isn't Saving Private Ryan, it's Pearl Harbor.  I thought this movie was done in an excellent way considering it is about an actual event.  The writers and directors stayed with the facts and recreated them well.  The attack scene was brilliant.  The actors did a great job of portraying their characters.  I even liked the love story.  <br />I have purchased the DVD (I seen the VHS version at my father-in-laws).  The DVD includes two very great bonuses:  The Making of Pearl Harbor and the History Channel's Unsung Heroes.  These two bonus features are worth the price of the DVD even if you aren't too crazy about the movie.<br />To sum it up I thought this was a great movie.  I've watched it twice within a month.  I'm not a big war movie fan but this movie grabs your attention and won't let go until the end when you are left wanting more.  Don't pay attention to the bad reviews, buy it or even rent it yourself and watch it.  I think you'll like it.  It's a keeper!!
B00000K3D4|4.0|Jennifer Connelly's early appearance on the screen in Jim Henson's The Labryinth is an excellent juxtapositon of make- believe and adventure cleverly disguising the journey from childhood through the labyrinth of adolescence into the composure of adulthood and integration of the inner child within us all. Meant to provoke adult's awareness of their own similar journey and keep kid's attention as Connelly's character faces off with David Bowie as the goblin king. It is a gas!!!
3895080799|4.0|Excellent book!  Easy to read and index of terms in the back make for easy reference for Old English terms.  Other stories are worth a look as well.  I never realized the author had written so many macabre stories.  It was fun and interesting.
B00005R87Q|4.0|I bought this movie knowing the comparissions between Gone In 60 Seconds but I think that this one is better.<br />The plot and the action secuences are better by fast.<br />A good choice.<br />Regards,David.
0451167716|5.0|Though Puzo is better known for helping create the Godfather movies, his book that inspired the movies is a fabulous one and lays the foundations that lead to the success of the movies.<BR>The book depicts the life of Mafia lord Vito Corleone and those of his family and close associates.  His struggles to maintain his position of power and ensure a good life for his family is a motif that seems unconventional given Corleone's position, but it ends up making its point of the universalness of all man.<BR>Interestingly, there is a whole storyline of this book that the movies cut out, which I personally found very fun and informative.<BR>Highly reccomended.

B00003CXE7|3.0|I've seen Gladiator but don't own it.  Looking at all these great reviews for it, though, I'm admit I'm tempted to buy it.  The movie has many good parts in it, like in the beginning when there's a big battle.  All the battle and action scenes in the movie are good too, but the opening one is my favorite.  This is all I really liked, though, the action.  The other stuff -- the acting, dialog, and ending -- wasn't any good.  For those who've read 'Hamlet' you'll know the ending was unoriginal.  I vaguely remember reading 'Hamlet' in high school, but I know it ended with poison, like 'Gladiator' does.  So the ending's no good.  The acting and dialog is pretentious.  So many looks and words are exaggerated or embellished for effect.  R. Crow's performance is good, and he's a good actor, but I think he's almost too good, to the point where he's unbelievable.  For me, and I'm sure for everyone, I need to believe a movie to really appreciate it.
B00004YKUY|5.0|Having heard the new cd, and seen the band live on three different occasions since Steve Augeri joined the band, there is only one thing i can say.....WOW! With a new linep that is 60% Journey, 60% Bad English, 40% Hardline, and former Tall Stories and Tyketto singer Steve Augeri, how could it go wrong. The songs are absolutely awesome. Thanks to napster, i was able to hear all of the tunes 4-6 months before the cd was released. The cd has everything from rockers to ballads. Neal Schon plays like only he can. He can go from playing a beautiful solo to a shredding lead run. \\" With Your Love\\" ranks as one of the alltime best Journey ballads.  Augeri does a wonderful job filling some pretty big shoes. there's no lookin back now for the band. Their journey is headed in the right direction.......straight to the top!
B00000J6AG|5.0|This is a great CD, blending dance beats and old-fashioned gospel. Much better overall than the single he remade with Gwen Stefani. Buy it.
B00003CXRP|3.0|I too am a believer that this film could have been much better.  Here's my main problem with it.  Even for those who have yet to see it, you already know that Tom Hanks has apparently been stranded on an island and (due to the nature of Hollywood scripts) it's safe to assume that he will at some point be rescued.  But do you get to see the manner in which he is rescued?  Do you get to see him engage in his first human contact in over four years when he gets rescued?  NO, YOU DON'T!  You sit through this long and quiet movie, hoping for a wonderous rescue, and you don't get it.  Quite simply, I don't understand it.  I do think though that Tom Hanks' peformance is great, and his struggle on the island is very compelling.  I just can't believe how this movie builds you up to such a high point, and then it comes crashing down with a big thud.
B00005T30L|4.0|Enid and Rebecca are a pair of outcast slackers who have just finished their senior year in high school.  Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) takes a job in the local coffee shop, while Enid (Thora Birch) must complete a remedial art class in order to earn her diploma.  Their relationship is strained as Rebecca tries to take the first steps towards financial independence, and Enid tries to decide what she really wants from life. They spend their free time dreaming about having their own apartment, making prank calls and co-existing with the weird denizens of their lower middle-class neighborhood - like the mullet-coiffed redneck who haunts the Sidewinder convenience store; the wheelchair-bound geezer armed with a laptop to cheat the coffee shop's trivia challenge; and Norman, who waits for a bus that will never come.<br />One of their prank calls snares a lonely middle-aged dork named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a quiet, insecure man who has a passion for collecting vintage 78-rpm records.  Eventually Enid befriends Seymour, alienating Rebecca even further.  <br />Ghost World is based on the Daniel Clowes' underground comic of the same name.  The movie is dry, witty and somewhat cynical - it's also a hilarious and bittersweet study of the disaffected youth of Generation X.  It's quirky and engaging, with great visual appeal and a very cool soundtrack.  It drags a little toward the end, however, and the ambiguous ending may frustrate some moviegoers.<br />P.S. You'll be sorry if you don't stick around until the end of the credits!<br />John C. Snider<BR>....
0375501851|5.0|This was one of the best contemporary novels that I have read in the past two or three years.  I was amazed at how well versed Miss Smith was on topics ranging from genetic engineering to religous studies to military strategy.  The characters were so full of life and she used humor in all of the right places.  I'm one of those readers who likes an author who ties up loose ends.  This was a complete novel in every sense of the word complete.  You can choose one of two words to describe this book: TIMELY or FUN.  You decide.
B000002IO1|3.0|Taking advantage of a recent daydream, I purchased a few CDs from my remembrance of years gone by (while dipping a madeline in my tea... no, wait a moment, that's someone else's daydream). This one came to mind due entirely to the throaty, breathy voice that belted out \\"Black Velvet\\" with such feeling. I was interested to discover if I would find the song as satisfying today as I did those years ago.<br />In short, I did. \\"Black Velvet\\" conjures the same dark, rural gothic images today as it did then. Then I listened to the rest of the CD.<br />Make a note, when encountering a CD by a singer who is essentially a \\"one hit wonder,\\" don't listen to the other songs on the CD. None of them have the power or the feeling of \\"Black Velvet;\\" some are merely mediocre, others just plain bad.<br />Be that as it may. If you are wishing to revisit your youth, or whichever of the stages in which you found yourself when this album was released, for a drive down Memory Avenue, ten bucks is not so drastic a price to pay for the cab fare.
B00005JKMO|5.0|Ali?   Who is that? the kids might ask.....Noo sweeties, not the TV Series - this is THE Champ!   THE Greatest!   The One!<br />Brilliant performaces by Will Smith as Ali, Jon Voight [totally immersed and unrecognizable as Howard Cosell], underrated Jamie Foxx as the befuddled, semi-alcoholic sidekick and more.<br />A moody piece loveingly crafted with great humor by the ensemble cast under Michael Mann's expert direction.    It's a smorgasbord of life in the 60ties seen through the brilliant mind of a sometimes too easily condemned public figure, [and seen with great wit and charm] - detailing the painful emergence of African American rights, culture and being.   Not only painting the public picture of suffering, but also the private and personal trails of the always embracing, always enduring African American woman.    <br />Highly recommended - viewing should be mandatory!
0792151712|5.0|Titanic is my all-time favorite movie.  It's the awesome love-story of a rich-girl (Rose) who hates her life and a poor artist (Jack) who has learned to love having nothing.  In their few days together Jack teaches Rose how to be herself and try to have fun.  Then, the ship hits the iceberg and they face losing each other, but they hang on until the bitter end...and then don't even let go in death.  Sure, this may be a sappy romance, but I like this sappy romance!

B00005NTNU|5.0|Are you in love with sturdy screenplays, slick production values and pressure-cooker plots involving unique twists?  Are you smitten for violence, colorful characters, creative cursing, and enough nudity and sexual situations to make even Hugh Hefner blush?  Make Inspector Harry Callahan your R-rated Valentine.  Order all of his adventures in this DVD collection and swoon as he back talks his cranky superiors, badgers his doomed partners with his cut-and-dry wisdom and goes after evil trash with his equally cut-and-dry .44 Magnum.  (This collection guaranteed to rivet people to the screen who normally shun cop thrillers.)

The bad thing about the book is that I don't feel colsure at the end of the book and philip should make another book that gives you a wonderful feeling.
B00005JKQX|5.0|&quot;A Beautiful Mind,&quot; based on true events, is a gripping, heartwarming tale filled with suspense and love.  A WV genius, John Nash, tries to prove his revolutionary theory on governing dynamics, while his mind takes a dark turn.  He struggles to keep in touch with reality while battling schizophrenia.  His loyal wife Alicia is what ultimatley keeps him grounded to reality and sanity.  This is an academy award winner for sure!!<br />&quot;He saw a world in a way no one could ever imagine...&quot;  <br />Its a beautiful story, a beautiful mystery, a beautiful movie!
B00005JKQX|4.0|Russell Crowe has done it again with another virtuoso acting performance as genius mathematician John Nash, a victim of schizophrenia.  This movie is very reminiscent of an earlier film, Shine, about a gifted, but mentally ill pianist who overcomes tremendous obstacles to make a comeback on the concert circuit.  I did feel the ending to this film was a little over the top in its sentimentality.  And who persuaded director, Ron Howard, to &quot;age&quot; Jennifer Connolly with what has to be one of the worst and phoniest make-up jobs in history!  Aside from that, this movie must be seen just to appreciate Crowe's amazing performance.
0345451325|5.0|I love the game, that's the only reason I bought the book. Since it's the origin of the Master Chief, I had to buy it. I wasen't expecting much, but I was blown away! The author did an amazing job making an origin out of the Master Chief and the Covanent. The fight scene's are really well written, (which is a good thing for this type of novel)the characters are established well and the spce fight scenes will remind you of some star trek movie. Overall, this book is a great read, it sucked me in for a week, but unfortunately spat me out. It may seem like a long book, but once you get to the end, you'll want the book to go on.
B00003CWL6|2.0|This is a disturbing film. The Academy Award judges(who are so far removed from middle class America) were convinced that this represents America and picked it as best picture. At the same time, the movie going audience who are probably the same people who worship televsion shows like Jerry Springer and Jenny Jones spent their money to watch a rehash of what they like to watch on tv. It's hard to make heads of what the point of this movie is about except that middle America is really screwed-up.  One goes to the movies for escapism, and not to be reminded of how bad and dangerous real life can be. The producers, writers, director probably knew the same kind of girls I knew in high school, because their portrayal in this movie nails it right on the head.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|At a time when movie-goers reward high budget, formulaic, Hollywood concoctions, I am grateful for this creative, unconventional, genre-defying movie. By genre, I don't mean musical or drama. I mean film, theater, opera, circus. Somehow the director had so much vision he managed to take so many unsavory elements (unoriginal love story, singing, dancing, so much lace and ruffles, a bit of campiness)and turned them into breath-taking entertainment. The first time I saw it, it did strange things to my pulse, but it was the second time that I let myself enjoy it. I feel sorry for all the critics and movie-goers who expected it to be what movies are 'supposed' to be and so didnt have anything to compare it to or knew how to relate to it. There really has never been anything like it. For those who have not seen it, I suggest approaching it as you would a roller-coaster ride (dont expect to be in control).
B00003CX5P|1.0|I love all the Star Wars movies, I can watch them over and over. But The Phantom Menace, was terrible. Jar Jar Binks drives me crazy and wrecks the entire movie. I wonder what The Attack of the Clones will be like? If Jar Jar Binks gets knocked off, I'll give it two thumbs up.
B00003CXRP|2.0|Another Z grade movie I've watched just for the satisfaction of strengthening my despite for commercial productions. The whole story is unbelievable to say at least and acting could be a lot better. Totally boring, awfully long and painfull to watch. Any intelligent person would instantly take the DVD back and demand a money return, but guess what? I'm quite a masochist and had the godly patience to wait until it finished. ....
0060392886|5.0|Back in his alcoholic heyday, Vince Neil was ejected from a Benihana restaurant for biting mouthfuls of cocktail glasses and then reprimanding his waitress for bringing them to him broken.  Nikki Sixx once shattered a Jack Daniel's bottle on a train passenger's head in Japan.  These are the sort of manic, intoxicating anecdotes that comprise the best of \\"The Dirt.\\"  The book also addresses more serious subjects like Nikki's troubled upbringing, Mick Mars' rare bone disease, Vince's turmoil over the death of his young daughter and (most tragically) Tommy Lee's relationship with Pamela Anderson.  Indeed, if there is one lesson to be learned from the Crue's autobiography, it is this:  a drunken weekend of bliss in Cancun won't serve as a strong foundation for marriage, even a celebrity one.<br />Only rock stars can spin tales of blowing millions on booze, blow, ...women with the singular luxury of having standing reservations at assorted rehab clinics.  I have little doubt that the decade-plus of decadence described is actually understated.  And much of the book reads like a therapeutic retelling of the highs and lows of substance abuse at a 12-step meeting.  While music is central to the mission of Motley Crue, it seems to play only a peripheral part in the lives of the band behind the scenes; Nikki admits as much by calling \\"Theater of Pain\\" and \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\" slipshod efforts.<br />Motley Crue's genuine craft is celebrity.  Oscar Wilde once noted that the lives of artistic geniuses are rather dull because their lives are consumed by their work.  Those less talented are far more interesting because their lives are their principal work of art.  Motley Crue resembles a Jackson Pollock painting - a chaotic, torrid mess on the surface but also totally bedazzling, bold, virile and gargantuan in its totality.<br />The book's layout and chapter titles are exceptional, which befits a group who mastered the visual aspects of rock music and lasting celebrity.  This is well worth the hardcover price, and is must reading for anyone even remotely interested in 80's pop culture (and who isn't?).ell worth the hardcover price, and is must reading for anyone even remotely interested in 80's pop culture (and who isn't?).
020161622X|5.0|I came to this book at a low time in my life. I had been working in software for over 12 years and I was beginning to think that I was an old fossil that no longer knew anything about how to write code &quot;these&quot; days. This book reassured me that I still knew what I was talking about and that my experience still had relevance in today's software environments. For that, I cannot thank the authors enough.<br />What I liked most about the book is how it is based in the real world. This isn't an airy-fairy book about how things should be done but what the authors have discovered as they have progressed through their careers. I must admit that a lot of it strikes a resonance within me, especially the areas that I feel that I am weak on.<br />In many ways the book confirmed many of my long-held beliefs (e.g. the command line is a &quot;good&quot; thing ... for developers). However, it encouraged me to think more about documentation (i.e. building it in) and meta-programming (to cut down on duplication and ease code generation). I have thought about this issues from time to time but Andy and Dave help you to realise that this can work for you, and cut down the overall amount of work you have to do. I had always avoided meta-programming since getting the immediate task completed always &quot;seemed&quot; more important at the time.<br />I cannot praise this book enough. It covers the praticalities of working in software in a way the Steve McConnell's Code Complete does not. I think the chatty style is what makes the difference. Code Complete, which I admire in many ways, seems far more dry than The Pragmatic Programmer. I would recommend that a engineer read both books since CC covers so many basic issues that it is difficult to fault (expect for the positioning of braces in C code) whereas TPP is ground in the practicalities of what does, and does not, work within a wide variety of environments.<br />I would heartily recommend TPP to anyone, especially to those thathave been working in software development for a few years.
B00003CXB7|4.0|This antiwar movie is timeless and classic, but Robert Altman's commentary mostly complaining about the hit series that spun off is irritating.  I think he's just 'ticked' off and jealous that the TV series of MASH actually overshadowed the movie to the point of the movie almost being forgotten. Both the show and the movie are great in their own unique way, and neither takes anything away from the other. The original movie's strength is the intertwined dialogue between the cast members along with some outrages moments, and great characters.  The odd thing between the movie and the television version is that in the movie, the theme song is called \\"Suicide is Painless\\" and the televsion series calls it \\"The Theme from MASH\\"...
B000001FS3|5.0|U2's The Joshua Tree is perhaps the greatest rock album of all time, right up there with Led Zeppelin IV, Who's Next, and Abbey Road.<br />The album's first three songs are the group's three best songs and are three of the best in rock history. No matter who you are or where you've been, Where the Streets Have No Name and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For will transport you back to your favorite place with your favorite people at your greatest moment. With or Without You will find anyone who has ever been in love choked up with emotion. These three songs are wonderful in terms of exhibiting The Edge's reverberating guitar, the group's beautiful melodies, and U2's vivid lyrics so filled with imagery.<br />The album, though, does not come to an end with With or Without You. The rest of the album is solid, especially songs like Running to Stand Still and One Tree Hill. Other U2 albums only give glimpses of the brilliance routinely displayed on The Joshua Tree. Pride, Bad, Beautiful Day, and Walk On are more isolated on their wonderful but nonetheless inferior albums. <br />Finally, the album has wonderful flow. U2 could have spread the first three colossal tracks throughout the album, but instead the band chose to put one right after the other at the beginning of the album for maximum effect. This creates a synergy on the album unmatched by any song combination in rock history. The three songs are three of the most emotional pieces of music ever written and are placed in the perfect order; the rest of the album is almost irrelevant. It just so happens that the remainder of the album is very respectable. If you're going to buy one U2 album, this is it. If you're going to buy one album from the past twenty years, this is it.
B00003CXS4|4.0|A British &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Lots of colorful characters running through the streets of underground London. People you can care,hate, or chuckle about,and a story with many twist and turns. It is a great change of pace to see the Brits as &quot;toughs&quot; apart from seeing them as &quot;proper&quot; like in period piece films that is often seen in British movies.  Hell, even James Bond would be frightened of the characters in this movie. A solid piece of entertainment and film making with another quirky performance by the versatile Brad Pitt.
B00005OAIE|5.0|When I first read of this artist in the Media Play magazine REPLAY they said that he would at first sound like Dave Matthews voice mixed with David Gray's music. I would say that after listening to his Cd, that's not entirely accurate.  He doesn't really sound like Dave because it's far smoother. Dave has a grittier quality. I also believe that it sounds more influenced by the vocal stylings of Stevie Ray Vaughn. Albeit a Stevie Ray Vaughn singing jazzy pop rock tunes. Mayer's music sounds more like Dave Matthews in the sense that it has a jazzy sound to it, but it doesn't retain their free jam feel.  Mayer isn't a genius, or cutting edge, but he has made a very consistently melodic and expressive album that mixes his influences just right. Blues, jazz, rock all equate into the mix for a mellow album. Also of note is his song of anguish &quot;My Stupid Mouth.&quot; The title says it all.

0871137380|1.0|I bought this book looking forward to learning about the Somalian incident and began reading it with great anticipation. I am so disappointed in the writer, both his &quot;jump-around&quot; reporting and his redundant and poor writing that I could not force myself past page 50. By that page he has told the reader no less than four times that the dust is ochre colored and the trees in the courtyards are small. He has also judged the Somalian adults as being lazy because they don't have jobs, this from a reporter whose own account describes a country who's infrastructure had been destroyed. Who, exactly was looking to hire anyone? He dismisses those who question military actions as &quot;liberal do-gooders&quot; and describes the troops as men who couldn't even &quot;write a high school report about Somalia,&quot; an ignorance that is truly frightening and explains why this country finds it so easy to &quot;bomb the brown people&quot;. At one point he states that the more than 100 military personnel involed includes only 2 people of color, which he says is revealing, but does not explain what it reveals or explain in any way what he meant by the statement. I surmise Mr. Bowden (...), and his treatment of the event is fragmented and superficial. As a high-school report, this book would get high marks for quantity of factual (?) information and flunk on writing skill.<BR>The book angers me because I feel duped by all the hype about it.

B00005Q45W|5.0|Formally, this music is not blues. But for me it feels like real blues.<br />It may be the utmost simplicity of the arrangements, or the overwhelming simplicity of the melodies, or the honest vocals... This CD has to rank among the best CD' issued in recent years. With each listening the melodies become more effective, without ever sounding banal. It takes a lot of courage to produce such simple arrangements in today's music market. But it seems that Cohen and the highly talented Sharon Robinson followed their own path all the way through.<br />It seems that the spiritual life Cohen and Robinson lead in a Zen monastery adds depth to their music. The result is so effective...<br />This is recommended to anyone who loves music.
B000001FS3|5.0|&quot;All That You Can't Leave Behind&quot; was a fantastic collection, a welcome return to form. Still, nothing on that album compares to the U2 of 1987.<br />&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; explores a variety of styles, but is unified by an elegant simplicity. The band channels its penchant for layered guitars and keyboards into sparse arrangements that allow the songs -- which have always been the best thing about U2 -- to shine through.<br />Take, for example, &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name.&quot; First we hear the swirls of keyboards, which seemingly combine an organ and choral voices. The effect is not schmaltzy or overwrought, but completely mesmerizing. Then Edge's finger-picked guitar enters, blending seamlessly into the keyboard textures. Just as the guitar segues into a gallop, the rhythm section of Mullens and Clayton drops in and anchors the song. <br />No extraordinary studio trickery, no &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; sonic pileup. Just good, stripped-down rock. &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; aside, is there any more effective opening in rock music?<br />The first three tracks are the most renowned, and they deserve it --&quot;With or Without You&quot; might be the best song in the U2 playbook. But &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; was recorded as, and is, an album. In fact, &quot;Running to a Standstill,&quot; in all its understated beauty, rivals &quot;With or Without You.&quot; The band propels &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; along smoothly, while Bono provides the emotional charge (apparently the song was written for the funeral of a friend -- the grief is definitely palpable in Bono's voice).  &quot;In God's Country&quot; is one of the best air-guitar songs this side of AC/DC. &quot;Exit&quot; seems somewhat shapeless, but the gorgeous &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot; brings the album to an appropriate close.<br />I hesitate to predict that U2 will ever make music like this again. There is a certain youthful exuberance and joy of discovery in the sound of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; that I doubt a band of middle-agers can capture. &quot;All You Can't Leave Behind&quot; seemed to confirm this: while excellent, it sounded pedestrian in comparison.<br />But then again, U2 has made a career of being unpredictable. So prove me wrong, guys -- please.
B00005JKES|5.0|This really is the best TV DVD set that I've come across.  The transfer's vibrant, it has DTS surround sound, and a plethora of extras.  My recent viewing is the first time that I've seen the show.  I put in the first disc and watched episode one and was quite bewildered.  To remedy this I bought a copy of the pilot from ebay, and when I rewatched episode one I loved it and am now addicted to Twin Peaks.  Artisan has done a wonderful job with this set.  Warner is certaintly the bad guy for not licencing the pilot.  Don't let that keep you from getting this set.  It really is David Lynch at the top of his game.
630471193X|5.0|Phenomenon may not be John Travolta best movie but he certainly gave his best performance as an actor and it is a shame that he was not even nominated for this movie. The story about a mechanic (Travolta) from a small town in California who witnessed a bright light from the sky and the next day he woke up as incredibly smart man. Robert Duvall gave excellent performance as the town doctor and Kyra Sedwick is the love interest. The story is moving and quite a few funny moments. <br />The DVD is OK as this is an early release. The picture is bright and sharp and the 5.1 sound is about average. Higly recommended DVD.
6305508550|5.0|This is simply the funniest most real-life comedy about the truly funny life of those of us who really work in an office!
0345440757|4.0|I don't know much about Hogg's background but she is funny. I liked this book in part because she was fair to both breastfeeding mothers and bottle mothers. I myself am a stay home mom who breastfed exclusively for 11 months. But I like her support of mothers who make either choice. I liked her E.A.S.Y. plan because it allowed a new mom to make a simple structure out of a very crazy time. I was clueless as a new mom with a colicky baby and I went through hell trying to regulate my baby who was VERY hard to read. Many of the suggestions she offers worked like a charm for us such as developing a bedtime routine. We used a bath and feeding prior to bedtime EVERY night and our colicky son slept through the night at 3 months and has since been a wonderful nightime sleeper. I had already developed the habit of nursing on one side only per feeding when I bought this book and she supported that practice. It is an easy book to read and helped me to feel relaxed with my son and my own insecurities about being an unexperienced mom. And it is funny. A downside is that her opinions are presented here, no scientific research. A good read for new parents but make sure you also consult other books such as the AAP's Caring For Your Baby and Yound Child and Dr. Marc Weissbluth's Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|haven't you ever listened to an album that felt so right, so true, so fresh that you had to listen to it over and over, wishing you could hear that same music again and again without hearing the same album again and again?<BR>manu chao is constructing a musical terratrophica not comprised of one melody or one album, but so far two albums which are both similar and different bound together with shared melody, fleshing out the full emotional possibilities of these simple tunes.  this is the continuity of an aesthetic vision.
B000021Y74|5.0|Run Lola Run is an intense suspense film.  When Lola's boyfriend looses 100,000 DM from a drug drop and has to have it by noon he calls up Lola in desprate need of help.  After suggesting to rob a grocery store, Lola pleeds with him not to and the movie kicks into three senarios of what may happen.  Every time Lola gets the money, but it's a question of if she gets it there too late or if her or her boyfriend might even die first.  The soundtrack is also amazing adding for an even larger on-the-edge-of-your-seat sensation.
B000059Z8J|5.0|&quot;Superman&quot; recalls a time when adventure movies had their innocence and weren't shameless corporate marketing devices.  This film has the same energy and spirit as the &quot;Batman&quot; movies, but what makes &quot;Superman&quot; a cut above the rest of the other based-on-a-comic movies is that this film has a heart.  Christopher Reeve is perfectly cast as the man of steel who parts from his father (Marlon Brando) and is transported to Earth to fight evil.  Gene Hackman is devilishly good as Lex Luthor and Margot Kidder shows spunk and verve as Lois Lane.  The DVD is also an attractive package: although the picture leaves a bit to be desired, the sound is so solid, it looks like it was recorded this year instead of 1978.  Plus, the features are a real treat, including a few featurettes, and the original trailers, which show how long a way we've come in marketing films.  As with all franchises, the Superman films hit a dead end and wore out their welcome, but the original is the first and best.  Recommended for all viewers.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Golden Raspberry Award Winner: WORST SUPPORTING ACTOR &quot;Jar-Jar Binks&quot;. Need I say More?
0805066691|5.0|What can one say?  This work, first printed in 1971,  is still in print and still widely read, and it very much deserves to be.  Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is probably one of the most eloquent, intense and moving works of exposition I've ever read.<br />For the most part the author, Dee Brown, lets the records and the personal reports of the various participants in the events of the American Indian wars of the 19th Century speak for themselves.  He creates thereby a narrative that is more riveting than any modern adventure novel and more poignant than even the finest of the Greek tragedies.  The work is very well researched, with an excellent bibliography of the author's sources.  It is also well illustrated, with photos or paintings of the various leaders of the native American tribes of the time.  It is a veritable who's who of the native west.  There are short biographies of many of the more important individuals.  Names like Black Kettle of the Cheyennes, Little Crow of the Santee Sioux,  Red Cloud and Crazy Horse of the Oglala Sioux, Chief Joseph of the Nez Perces  (&quot;I will fight no more forever,&quot;) Sitting Bull of the Hunkpapa Sioux, and Cochise and Geronimo of the Chiricahua Apaches are among those most likely to be recognized by non-native Americans.<br />What I found most interesting was the extent to which the various tribes were able to hold out against the odds, even resoundingly defeating the US military that hounded them nearly to extinction.  It is evident from even a quick reading that it was less military superiority than the policy of starving out the people by destruction of land, animals, and other property that brought about defeat of the tribes.  The US military of the time  made a war on women, children and the elderly, slaughtering even infants in surprise raids made in undeclared wars or in provoked confrontations.  Starvation, freezing weather, and disease brought these proud people to their knees, not military might.<br />In these times of international conflict the tragic treatment of the native American population should be a cautionary tale of what can happen when the self righteous, the culturally narrow, the ambitious, and the greedy use the military to achieve their own agenda.  The types of people responsible for the near eradication of a race of people in the 19th Century are still common enough today.  In my opinion this book should be required reading for any American history course from junior high school level and beyond it.  Only by raising the consciousness of the average citizen from youth onward can the specter of racism on this scale be avoided./>In these times of international conflict the tragic treatment of the native American population should be a cautionary tale of what can happen when the self righteous, the culturally narrow, the ambitious, and the greedy use the military to achieve their own agenda.

B000002OMN|3.0|\\"Back into Hell\\" just might sum it up for the legions of critics who panned Meat Loaf's original Bat out of Hell album nearly 16 years before this one.<br />But the zillions of people who bought the original (and continue to buy it) probably just want more of the same. And so they should, for Part II is at its best when it's ripping off -- er..reliving! -- the past glories of Part I.<br />As in the original, the songs are written by Jim Steinman, who peppers the CD with just enough Hell/motorcycle references to justify the title. The production also owes something to the original, though Steinman replaces Todd Rundgren on production duties (Rundgren is reduced to arranging background vocals and, one assumes, getting coffee).<br />The CD's opener, the much-maligned \\"I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)\\" with its male/female tradeoff and sing-song chorus is the missing link between \\"Paradise By the Dashboard Light\\" and \\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\\". Once again, Meat Loaf has an itch to scratch. This time, however, he's willing to say he loves her -- a far cry from the same guy who once wanted to \\"sleep on it\\". Fittingly, his advances are once again turned down.<br />Equally fun is \\"Out of the Frying Pan (and into the Fire)\\" an upbeat rocker that benefits from the fact that Meat Loaf can't pronounce \\"frey-ing\\" pan. And despite its impossible title, \\"Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than They Are\\" is an irresistable ballad dripping with typical Meat Loaf angst.<br />The disc flounders, however, on tunes like \\"It Just Won't Quit\\", which features one of the cheesiest synth solos of all time and \\"Life is a Lemon and I Want My Money Back\\", which is a thud-rock misfire, though there's something undeniably sastisfying about Meat Loaf demanding his money back.<br />For anyone who liked Bat I, there's more to enjoy here. And, as far as Meat Loaf is concerned, everyone else can go to Hell.
0684867621|4.0|Growing up I started camping at a young age and before I knew it I was wandering thru the woods with my younger brother, scared to death to go too far but wanting to know what was around the next bush and always being disappointed when my parents would discover what I was trying to do.  Trisha at the young age of 9, gets lost accidentally and stumbles across a world in the deep woods that I always knew was there but never had the opportunity to discover.  At times I felt she was entirely too smart for a 9 year old (knowing and remembering all the info about the berries and plants) and other times I felt that in the real world, she would have had a lot more close encounters with snakes, but overall it was neat book with a happy ending.  Unusual for a King book but I'm not complaining.
B000001E18|2.0|Originally intended to be released as an EP to promote U2's Zoo TV tour, Zooropa is a risky experiment in style that ultimately fails.<br />Exploring electronica in a deeper way than its predecessor, the classic Achtung Baby, Zooropa yanks U2 far from its earnest, Irish roots and transplants them in a cool, post-apocalyptic disco somewhere in Berlin. As one might expect, the results are uneven.<br />Case in point is the CD's first single, &quot;Numb&quot;, an industrial-style rap featuring the rarely heard vocals of guitarist The Edge(he also sang &quot;Seconds&quot; on War). To release this track as the first single was considered mind-blowingly subversive and cutting edge at the time. Now, alongside U2's other singles, &quot;Numb&quot; is the audio equivalent of the family member that no one wants to talk to at the reunion, a novelty song that would give Lou Reed minutes of laughter.<br />More successful is the CD's other big surprise: the lead vocal by Johnny Cash on &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, which cleverly updates Cash's sound by planting his world-weary vocal smack dab in the middle of a sythesizer riff. The neato result is the best thing on the CD and deserves a place on all future Johnny Cash compilations.<br />Other highpoints are few and far between, though &quot;Lemon&quot; is a giddy ditty worth a listen just to hear Bono in all his falsetto glory. And the beautiful &quot;Stay (Faraway So Close)&quot; is the one track from the CD strong enough to earn a place in the band's current live set list. <br />Not beloved in its day, and sounding even less substantial now, Zooropa is likely a CD that most U2 fans own, but that very few actually play. For completists only.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I suppose I'll start by addressing comments made by CJG.  Yes, the ending is much more unsettling then most anything the Hollywood hit machines can crank out, but that's what makes the film so powerful.  The movie is about addiction, plain and simple.  The characters in this movie are so deeply seeded in their addiction that there is no possible way they can come out unscathed (Ellen Burstyn's character may have a chance).<br />Let me reiterate what everyone else is saying about Marlon Wayons performance by saying that he is fantastic in this movie.  I sincerely hope, after seeing this movie, that he never appears in another comedy/spoof film again.  He is that good in this movie.  Jared Leto is the guy who appeared on &quot;My So Called Life&quot; (with Claire Danes), and if you remember him from that role alone, you never will again after this movie.  He is almost too good an actor for someone who appeared on that show.  Jennifer Connelly continues to take the risks as an actress that made me love her so much in &quot;Dark City&quot;.  Yes, she is good looking, but you won't see that at all here, just a great performance.<br />Another actor that few people give mention at all is Christopher McDonald (the ringleader of the info-mercial Sarah watches on T.V.).  This guy has gone from his previous best known role as Shooter McGavin (the great &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;) to this role, and it really shows his chops as an actor.<br />The bottom line is that you have to watch this movie.  Not only is the cinematography amazing, but after watching it, I promise you will not even think about using drugs for the rest of your natural life.  Yes, it is THAT disturbing.<br />Let's see what Aronofsky can do with the next Batman movie (a crap franchise, indeed).
B00005A1PR|5.0|I was compelled to express my gratitude to the music industry and it's critics, for their acknowledgement of this profound ARTIST. India's talent and creativity DESERVE the upmost recognition. Primarily, because she refuses to compromise for the sake of record sales, or a shallow image. &quot;Video&quot; speaks for itself, and is a reflection of India's personal journey. While listening to the captivating &quot;Ready For Love&quot;, one is brought to to the realization, that a position in the &quot;Album of the Year&quot; category, is not displaced. Concrete, confident and inspiring, &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; is a &quot;DIAMOND IN THE RUFF&quot; and worth every listen.
0345339711|5.0|I have read already The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Rings and I have one thing to say about The Two Towers, it is awesome.  After the Fellpwship you know Gandalf is dead, the fellowship is probably going to be scattered, and Frodo is going with the faithful Samwise to Mordor alone. The Two Towers, like the first book, is split in to two sections.  One is with Strider, Legolas, and Gimli to set out and find Merry and Pippim and deal with the treachory of Saruman(and on hint, there is a huge suprise in store).  The second is all about Frodo and Sam on the trek to Mordor with the treachorous Gollum.  At first he seems to be different and wants to be called his old name, Smeagol,but you quickly learn that Gollum has two sides(named by Sam as Slinker and Stinker).  It all ends with a perfect setting for the next book, The Return of the King.  All in all The Two Towers is one of the best books you'll ever read in your lifetime.

B00005U2LM|5.0|This album brings back the good old days with old fashioned Wu Tang Slang.  Wu tang has definitely changed the hip hop industry and have been trend setters. It is very hard to compare this with past wu albums as the new eras have brought about different changes. This album has old fashioned beats such as, &quot; In The Hood,&quot; , &quot;Radioactive&quot;, &quot;Iron Flag,&quot; and combines new beats like &quot;UZI,&quot; . This album is much better then &quot; the W&quot; which was definitely under rated but shaky. That album contributed great songs such as &quot;The gravel pit&quot;, &quot;Careful&quot; and &quot;thang, thang,&quot;. One of the best little pieces on this new album is the Iron Flag Anthem which is on track #11 but towards the end. Many of these songs are classic hits and you can see yourself bobbing your head to them throughout the years. The difference between a good album and a classic is that a classic still sounds new after many years. This album is definitely a head banger. Lyrically, there is no soloist or group that talks the streets like the Clan does. In addition although they may be looking for more airplay they do not sell out on this album. Im very proud to be a Wu tang fan after this album, The W was a lil shaky and worried me, but here i am RAISING THE IRON FLAG. WITH MY FISTS IN THE AIR (Like at the Wu tang Concert on the 19th at Hammersterin) yelling, WU-TANG!!! WU-TANG!!!
B00005R2M3|5.0|I could rank `Laundry Service` byfar the best of Shakira,I think.With her English debut she's blinking to the lucrative American market.But,those who try to undermine her unambiguous favourable outcome shall be proven erroneous.The rock infusion on the songs is well perceived which bringd her about to a distinctive place than other latinas and which is good.Shakira got much commendation from me with her latest album.
B00001PE4D|5.0|This is one of the best teen movies I've ever seen! It aboards very serious matter about sexuality and human relations between high-school students.<br />The perfomances of Sarah-Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillipe, Reese Witherspoon and Selma Blair are astonishing! Not to mention the exceptional appearance of Joshua Jackson. <br />This movie has no sex scenes or nudity, but several adult situations; I guess it reflects the reality of a large group of late-90s teens.
0451191153|5.0|If you are looking for a book of &quot;suspense,&quot; as one reviewer here mentioned and subsequently gave the book a horrible review, then I recommend visiting the aisle where the mediocre drivel of John Grisham, et al is placed.  <br />The Fountainhead is simply the best book I have ever read.  So many readers here have told you what it *is* about, so let me tell you what it is *not.*<br />The Fountainhead is not a feel-good book meant to make you feel all warm &amp; fuzzy inside.  (Buy Harry Potter if that is your mentality.)<br />It is not about the status quo and going along with popular politics/opinion in order to get ahead.<br />It is not your typical novel that was dumbed down so American readers can &quot;get it.&quot;  In fact, if you don't get what the book is all about, then perhaps that is a good thing.  <br />Quite simply, if you are looking for a book to take along to the beach then skip The Fountainhead.  If -on the other hand- you are looking to stretch your brain and deviate from the usual, mass produced, mass sexualized, mass dumbed-downess of an ever encroaching Disney-inspired, American mentality, then do yourself a favor and read Ayn Rand.  *Any* Ayn Rand.
B00003CX8J|4.0|Very good movie, very good story development, introduction of some of the classic X-men characters; excellent visual effects.<br />The Cons I find in this movie are that I don't buy the idea of Magneto's machine, this movie is developed in a more \\"real\\" environmet\\"; and the fact that not all x-men appear here (where are Gambit and Jubilee?)<br />Overall is a very good movie. If you like action and sci-fi, buy it!
B00005ARDC|5.0|This is an impressive debut album.  These guys know their craft and pay homage to their roots while being creative and not ripping off.  Everybody grew up listening to something.<br />There are a lot of ideas and emotions on this CD.  In order to appreciate this band and album you need to:<br />a.  listen to the CD a few times to let it all sink in; and then<br />b.  play &quot;Whatever Happened to my Rock n' Roll&quot; in your car at full volume while driving in excess of 90 mph at 2 a.m.<br />You won't be dissapointed.
B000000JO3|5.0|I shouldn't have to explain to anyone how classic and timeless Minor Threat is, anyone truely into punk rock should already know.  This band is the reason why all you sxe kids &quot;X&quot; up. This band is the reason why countlss amounts of people (including myself) got into punk rock, and stayed. This band is the greatest hardcore/punkrock band of all time (and that is a proven fact).
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Okay, I admit it.  When the Absinthe fairy appeared, I was hooked.  I mean, here I thought I was the only guy in the world who saw little green fairies while on a bender . . . <br />The movie is a total hoot!  Luhrmann keeps piling up bad 70s  pop songs, relentless kitsch, bad 80s pop songs, dizzying camerawork, bad 90s pop songs, huge dance numbers, bad Rogers and Hammerstein songs and narcoleptic Argentinians, one upon the other, until he creates this massive, frenetic, rococo tower of crazed pop images that lists wildly back and forth in the wind, but somehow manages never to collapse upon itself.  It's a gorgeous, sprawling, insane mess that completely impressed me with its audacity, energy and originality.  <br />And, of course, now I'm gonna think of Jim Broadbent every time I hear a Madonna song . . .
B000002JOH|4.0|This CD is worth the money. I will agree with ALL Metallica fans that Phil Anselmo ... as a singer, but then again NO ONE in heavy metal has voice as good as James. I still can't listen to Slayer and Sepultura because those guys scream their lungs out, Panthera is somewhere in beween those two and Heitfield.  Diamond Darrell is preety damn good guitar player, though it sounds like it has been fabricated bit too much. Drummer though kicks ... and sounds like Ulrich in Justice if not better. This has made it to my essential list.
B00005OM4N|1.0|This CD is a shift in Britney's style, but a shift for the worse. Melody was sacrificed for harsh rhythms in an attempt to uncover the &quot;matured&quot; Britney, so that there's more noise than music. However, it amazes me that the same masses who praised Britney at her debut are now claiming that this album is her best, although it's radically different.<br />If you liked Britney before this album and you don't want to change your opinion about her music, stay away from this one.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|I was given this as a present as most of my friends knew my fascination with naval history - especially WWII. By chance, I had just finished reading an account of the capture of the Enigma from U110 in May 1941 (a very hazardous boarding led by Sub Lt David Balme from HMS Bulldog). I was aware the film was only loosely based on these events but I as I watched I realised that any enjoyment I would have got from the film was totally ruined by the building resentment that Hollywood had totally rewritten the story to give its core audience (the American public) home grown heroes to cheer. Nothing wrong with that you might think - but why not choose any one of the many heroic feats of arms performed by the USN - esp in the Pacific Theater - where there would not be the need to take credit away from some very brave men and there would also be the opportunity to educate the public about the real sacrifices made on our behalf 60 years ago.<br />To those who think I am being over defensive - firstly  I think, as a matter of principle, historical revisionism is dangerous and should be exposed when encountered and secondly just imagine the reaction if a British film came out detailing the capture of Iwo Jima by British Royal Marines or one showing an outnumbered  Royal Navy carrier force inflicting grievious losses on the Japanese at Midway....
B0000508U6|4.0|Even if Coldplay isn't the most original band in the world, they do have very good taste in their influences.  They seem to get a lot of Radiohead comparisons, but I don't quite see the connection other than that both singers tend to overuse their falsettos a bit.<br />The band is quite good, especially the drummer and most of the songs are very catchy in a maudlin way.  This is the type of quality guitar rock that used to be easier to find, but is now becoming quite rare.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Listen to some of these lines from just the first half hour:<br />&quot;I got some genuine French champagne, from France, and I thought we could celebrate you being my hero.&quot;<br />Ben - &quot;You are so beautiful it hurts.&quot; Kate - &quot;It's your nose that hurts.&quot; Ben - &quot;I think it's my heart.&quot;<br />&quot;If I had one more night to live, I'd want to spend it with you.&quot;<br />&quot;It's so cold it goes deep into my bones, but there's one place I can go that's warm and that's to think of you.&quot;<br />&quot;Every day I look at the sunset and try to draw the last ounce of heat from the long day and send it from my heart to yours.&quot;<br />After that last one, I just couldn't take it anymore!  Blecchhh!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I have to say that this must be the best movie ever. And like Shrek, the ogre, Shrek, the movie, is like an onion. It has layers!!! <BR>There is the first layer of animation, which is superb. The characters, although cartoony, are very detailed, and the voices are superb. I didnt mind the cartoony part too much, because the main character, after all is a big green ogre, and how can you have a non cartoony green ogre?? <br />Then there is the other layer of humor. The jokes are side splitting, and although some of them are a bit &quot;bathroom humor&quot; - it's not too bad. The jokes are done very tastefully, and they are definetly much more decent than the way kids talk nowdays. Older kids(7-15) and adults will love the humor. Younger kids may not get some of the humor. Eddie Murphy is excellent as the DOnkey, and I could watch the entire DVD just watching Donkey and nothing else. There are potshots at Disney characters, which can be quite entertaining<br />The next layer is the story, which is sort of a farce on the traditional fairytale, which would be expected to be predictable. It does have a slight twist at the end though<br />Next are the characters and the relationships between the characters. Shrek and Fiona, and even Donkey too some extent are quite deep. Both Shrek and Fiona have their wishes, hopes and desires. Both the characters have paradoxes within them. Shrek is a green ogre that everybody hates, and who is quite content living in the swamp alone. However, he wants to be loved, and deep inside he wants company. He has built up a facade of a big macho guy who lives alone, to keep people from hurting him. Fiona is a female who has pre-set notions of &quot;true love&quot;, and has her life planned down to the last detail. However, life doesnt turn out the way she planned, when a big ugly ogre comes and saves her. Part of the story is how she comes to term with the circumstances, and in doing so, finds her true self. The characters could have been muchto complex for a children's story, however the story has been played out sobeautifully that it's not too hard to understand them. The realtionship between Donkey and Shrek as best friends is really beautiful and so realistic<br />Next is the dialogue. The dialogue is full of humor, but it also at the same time manage to be quite deep. The conversation between Shrek and Onion on how Ogres are like onions is astonishingly simple and yet so descriptive of the character. The author must have given a lot of thought on how to represent the character in such a simple, clean, easy yet meaningful terms<br />Last is the music. There are song and dance sequneces in the movie, and there is a karoake scene as an extra that the kids will enjoy<br />So, I would say definetly buy this DVD, I know I am going to. Kids, and even some adults will love watching it again adn again and again
B000001FY9|5.0|If you are just being introduced to the father of reggae Bob Marley, then this is the CD to get.  It has all his greatest hits.  The beautiful &quot;Is This Love&quot;, &quot;Redemption Song&quot;, &quot;Now Woman No Cry&quot;, &quot;Exodous&quot; &quot;Could You Be Loved&quot; &quot;Three Little Birds&quot; and &quot;One Love&quot; are my favorites.  Marley really will forever be the heart and soul of reggae.

0792844882|5.0|Showgirls is one of those films I bought used at a video store and find myself watching from to time just because its so entertaining.  This is one of those movies that is pure camp.  I think it would have been much better if it had been made to be a campy comedy instead of a supposedly serious film. There is glitz and glamour and exotic costumes and the film really shows Las Vegas as a wild place. Yes the dialogue is awful and the acting is beyond out there.  The characters are for the most part not likable at all and the acting is beyond over the top.  Its like Elizabeth Berkeley just overacts during the entire film and in doing this makes some very overly dramatic faces.  Even the sex scenes are hilarious with the main character making love in a very spasmodic fashion in the pool.  I still can't believe these guys made the film &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; which was a very good suspense thriller.<br />All in all, Showgirls is a bad movie but an entertaining one. I'm never bored when I watch it.
B00005RDAF|3.0|It's not a bad collection,but it isn't exactly what the name implies. Yes,It would be good to include Britney's entire video collection all in 1 place.The only place I have seen 'Born To Make You Happy' is on the videotape that McDonald's sold last year.If you're a big Britney fan,this is one for you to add to your collection. But for only 30 minutes long, its a bit expensive. I'll wait for the Live in Las Vegas DVD. More excitement for the money.
6304007523|5.0|I have always been an unabashed fan of this movie, and succumbed to its humble magic yet again during the 25th anniversary tribute on TV.  Rocky, looking like the holy fool from world folklore in his comical all-black ensemble and gold neck cross, clashes with the godlike Apollo and emerges as a hero in spite of the judges' decision back on earth.  The other reviewers are exactly right about the story's allegorical and archetypal qualities.  When people watch a movie again and again and again you can bet that it has tapped into some universal human constants.  <br />None of the reviews I read mentioned the classic Thanksgiving vignette when Adrian and Paulie have a hysterical screaming match and the turkey gets pitched out the window  (and caught behind the scenes since there was no room in the low budget for another!)  There is passion aplenty in this grouping, which needs only to add self-discipline, commitment, and cooperation to  \\"go the distance\\" together as an interdependent unit.  One of the key moments comes when Rocky's nose is broken in the big fight. Once the last vestige of pride is gone he can at last give himself completely to the impossible battle half blind like only the bravest champions can.  Rocky's experiences in the ring remind me of Nikos Kazantzakis' story about a man who fought with the Devil and hoped to win, then fought with God and hoped to lose!  <br />...  Let us not forget that the main function of the hero/servant is to inspire and empower, as when Rocky brings all the neighborhood kids up with him when he again ascends the City Hall steps in ROCKY II!  Rocky turned the American Dream into a timeless myth that can still be realized if the Russian and Ukrainian immigrants I work with are to be believed.  This film is a treasure.
0920668364|5.0|I love this book. I first read many years ago, when my much younger (12 years) brother was a child. He loved it, and I loved to read it to him. Now I read it to my 3 year old niece. I cried when I first read it, and I cry now. <br />This book is about the unconditional love between parents (and even grandparents or other family members depending how closely knit you are) and children. It speaks to the notion of knowing that the bond between a parent and a child is something that is hard to break. <br />The beauty of this book is that it isn't corny or fake. Everything about the story has a ring of truth to it, even the whimsical bits like the mother going to the son's house and sneaking in. It was sweet and it gave me a chuckle, and it was a poignant metaphor for the notion that no matter how far away we are from our families, we carry them with us everywhere.<br />I know that as I get older, and watch my parents aging, and see them dealing with the aging of their own parents, I can begin to understand in a new way the ending of the book, where the son sings the song to his mother. <br />The illustrations are exquisite - I love all the details that are included, like, as another reviewer mentioned, the way the cat ages.<br />I think any parent would do well to own this book. I know that it is now my favorite baby shower gift.
B0000508U6|5.0|Smooth melodic vocals mixed with nice guitar riffs and a cool feeling makes for one great album.This album is one of those albums where you can listen to it and not get annoyed with it.Whenever I listent o it i fall in love all over again.
0920236820|5.0|I adore this book. It is about Princess Elizabeth who has to defeat a dragon when the Prince is kidnapped. Elizabeth has to rely on her own strengths, creativity and ingenuity to win the battle with the dragon. Every female I've read this book to has loved it, from my 3 year old niece to a group of 12 year olds to my university Women's Studies class. The book has a fantastic message about women's potential to break through sex-role stereotyping. The book boosted the self-esteem of the girls I was working with and led to some great discussions about the fact that they don't need to have a boyfriend to be happy, and the need to accept themselves and recognize their strengths. I think this book is empowering and uplifting and I reccommend it to anyone who is in contact with young girls. Heck, get it for yourself. You deserve it.
B000059TPN|5.0|This movie can be watched time and time again.  The great music, action and awesome actors.  A definite addition to anyone's dvd collection.
B00003CWL6|2.0|..This is the best that the Movie People can do for an Academy Award, no less! Starting off with the hubby masturbating in the shower (yes, just the facts,no embellishments). Some pleasant shots of California suburbs. So what, I can see some trendy suburbs here in Pa., or anywhere else for that matter. Every character is completely useless, except the long suffering daughter, whose father (who does his thing in the shower,this demonstrates his dead end,loveless marriage with an even more shallow money/real estate obsessed wife) is a true smarmy, lying wimp, not above smoking dope with his deranged (but pleasant) teenage neighbor,who turns into a friend of the wimp's long-suffering daughter.And to top it off this frustrated 40 year old suburban white,married (very unhappily) male,with one daughter has an ogling obsession for the Lolita-like cheerleader,foul mouthed friend of said long suffering daughter! There are plenty more generally nasty stereotypes, including the big shot real estate man with whom the said cipher of a wife goes gaga, resulting in the standard voyeuristic hard to watch bedroom scene which is supposed to be funny. And we're supposed to think that blackmailing your pain in the rear boss is funny too! And the strange boy's dad who thinks the aforementioned man, he who does smoke pot with son (not known by son's father) is actually what was once referred to as \\"queer\\", and may be directing his son in this direction..More misleading,voyeurism which some may find sickening. One or two of the real estate scenes may be funny,even if they're older and more dated than MR BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE from about 50 years ago...The last 15 minutes all of a sudden become a decent thriller too, if you make it this far. And there is a twist at the very end, but this viewer was not surprised in the least...The moral seems to be \\"Why don't we just treat everyone with love and kindness,and think about the important things?\\" Nice moral,but a very ugly way to sayit!! However, this film is timeless in that it is a classic case of a very ugly popular culture at the turn of the millenium! After watching this Academy Award Winner (Best Picture !!), I decided I would pass on the standard self-congratulatory \\"Making of this Film\\" nonsense.PS...Could anyone ever imagine leading actors (leading men)of yesteryear playing a role here like Spacey's,starting with the shower scene? Imagine Clark Gable, Jimmy Stewart, Cagney, Bogart,H. Fonda, John Wayne,Cary Grant, Burt Lancaster, William Holden, the Marx Bros(!)Jack Lemmon,the Three Stooges(!),Ronald Reagon,Sinatra,Orson Welles, anyone...I Don't think so. But in the 80's 90's film industry, yes such a role is possible, maybe even coveted!
B00002ZMNV|5.0|I purchased this dvd for my boyfriend who is a diehard metallica fan.  I think of all the gifts he received he liked this best. These are great presents for people who enjoy concerts.  You can listen to the music and watch when the spirit moves you.  This DVD included many of his favorite tunes and the orchestra makes it awesome.
0812580346|5.0|I could not put this book down.  The gripping plot, combined with an easy narration that avoids complicated and awkward explanations of scientific details, kept me up until the book was finished in a single night.  This book combines science fiction with some mystery, while touching on the future of mankind, and follows the success of some good, smart, hard-working characters.  Great read that was highly entertaining.
B000000W8C|4.0|I grew up in Indiana and went to school in Ohio.  Before the internet, I relied on word of mouth and Rolling Stone for cd purchases.  I bought Urban Hymnes during my Junior year and it really blew my mind.  It is my favorite album of all time for me.  &quot;Loaded&quot; by Velvet Underground is second.  This band is easy to LOVE for the masses because it has the 'unknown, uncommercialised' appeal and because they are truly a great band. For some reason I waited to buy 'A Northern Soul', maybe out of fear that it would ruin my feelings toward the band.  The album is cool to listen to because I can feel there movement towards &quot;Urban Hymnes&quot;.  It is less layered and complex than &quot;urban hymnes&quot; and &quot;So it Goes&quot; is already a classic in my mind, along with &quot;Drive you Home.&quot;  I bought Richard solo effort and it was too calculated.  BUT, Richard Ashcroft truly is incredible, defiently the most under rated rock artist in the last ten years.  Maybe he is huge in the UK, but not in the states.  Buy this album if you want to listen to some great music.  Ryan Adams and The Strokes media machines and alcolades make me sick while &quot;The Verve&quot; goes unnoticed, but hey, isn't that how we like it?
B000050IE6|5.0|With Still life, their fourth album, the masters of Swedish Melancholy are back with a vengeance. Simply put on this album, the hard parts are heavier, the soft parts are creamier and the mood is sad, sad, sad. <br />Opeth are utterly frightening musicians. They excel in areas where other bands are afraid to even tread. Like pulling off thrash breakdowns in the middle of grinding death metal riffs, only to throw in a lone acoustic guitar in for one measure. The singing ranges from classic cookie monster growl, to genuinely sweet, melodic bridges. Again, this is ground that Opeth has covered in the past, but their mastery of it is becoming more and more complete. And the drums are booming.<br />If you are reading this you are probably already a fan of Opeth. Maybe you have just heard that they are pretty good. Even within the doom metal circles, these guys have a great rep. But Akerfeldt, Lindgren, Lopez and Mendez take it way up a notch here. Because they are not just singing about dueling trolls and God's withering touch. They are talking about women and how sad this makes them. In other words, they realize they are human. Which is a good thing.<br />I played this album for my best friend in my car and when I asked him how he liked it, he replied, \\"It's perfect.\\" Indeed.
0385505833|1.0|I have been a John Grisham fan since his first book.  Although some are better than others, &quot;The Testament&quot; being my favorite, this was a huge disappointment.  I found the characters to be nothing more than annoying and, although once I start a book I read it to the conclusion, I couldn't wait for this book to end.  Thank goodness it wasn't a lengthy volume; I might have had to change my commitment to finish every book I start.  I didn't find the characters to be real people; I can't believe anyone would act as they did.  Mr. Grisham, stick to lawyer books!!
B000002WPR|4.0|I LOVED this album when I was a teenager (I had the explicit version) and I still consider it the best album ever.  But last year I decided to get the clean version.  Quite a disappointment.  The song that originally got me into the album, &quot;7th Chamber part 2&quot; isn't even on the clean version.  They've just cut out far too much when it wasn't necessary.  It's really a disappointing listening experience compared to the clean version of Wu-Tang Forever for example.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Ron Howard's interpretation of the life of John Forbes Nash, the Nobel Prize winning economist and mathematician, based on the biogragphy of the same name, is fantastically enthralling as it acts as a kaleidoscope into a mind so abstractly imaginative it lost its grip on reality.<br />Without spoiling Howard's approach to achieving the audience's appreciation of paranoid schizophreneia, I will say that he manages this with great success, so much so that the audience midway through the film questions his own understanding of what is real and unreal.<br />All the performances are commendable--Crowe's gentlemanly West Virginian speech patterns and exquisite hand gestures remind us of how different such great minds are--whether or not they actually are the hallmarks of Dr. Nash are irrelevant; they add dimension to the personality Crowe perceives in his own mind.  I don't think I've seen Jennifer Connelly perform this well since I first saw her in &quot;Once Upon a Time in America--her integrity in this shines through with a rare radiance.  Ed Harris is particularly threatening as the G-man who elicits Dr. Nash's expertise in looking for and cracking codes in 50s mainstream publications.  Fantastic casting!<br />The musical score is wonderfully appropriate--intricate, haunting, triumphant with an odd little edge--hopefully a sure thing for an Oscar like many of the other components of this film.<br />Do go and see this film, not because it accurately portrays the life of Dr. Nash--it is a film after all--an entertainment that is also a work of art with its own theme and purpose in its own right--if biographial accuracy is what you want read the book--see it because Dr. Nash's accomplishment is simply astonishing and should be shared and applauded.
0394800184|5.0|This book will make your child run the gamut of emotions, from sadness, to desperation, to joy at the end.  I still remember this story well from my own early childhood.  It sure made me appreciate my mother!!  <br />We bought it for our own child and it is one of his favorites.  This is an essential book for any child's library.  <br />(A big caveat: make sure your child isn't overly sensitive.  Also make sure to read this book to the very end or else your child will be very sad!)<br />Also as another reviewer pointed out, this book has deeper themes for adults to ponder as well!  It's one of the few books I can read to my kid and actually be interested in analyzing it.  :)
6305696071|3.0|You all know Pretty Woman by now.  If you like this movie, I do, get the DVD and listen to Gary Marshall's comments.  If you know Gary Marshall at all you know he is a hoot!  I laughed during the whole movie just listening to his comentary on making the movie.  I my never watch this movie again with out his comentary.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Galaxy Quest is another space-age movie but with a comedic twist. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman head the cast of actors who starred as astronauts in a cult Television series over twenty years ago called Galaxy Quest.<br />Loyal fans still flock to Sci-Fi conventions to pay homage to their adventurous heroes. It is at one of these conventions that Commander Taggart (Allen) meets the Thermians, a race of aliens from the Klatu Nebular. They have misinterpreted episodes of the series as 'historical documents' and arrive on earth to whisk the actors into space, thinking that they can use certain 'documents' to help them defeat a deadly adversary.<br />After a string of hilarious events, the crew are convinced that the Thermians plight is genuine and the actors are beamed up on a mission to help save them. Now it is time for them to put on the performance of their lives!<br />All ends well when the actor Jason Nesmith (Commander Taggart) gets in contact with a fan on earth and he along with his friends who are fellow Questrian fans, guide the crew back home after they save the Thermians. <br />Once Galaxy Quests gets you laughing, it will keep you in hysterics. In addition to the humor, this movie is full of great special effects, action, excitement and an unpredictable romance.<br />I loved Galaxy Quest because it appealed to me as a Star Trek fan. A must see for Space Cadet fans alike. You are guaranteed to love it even if you are not into Sci-Fi films. It constantly pokes fun at this genre but at the same time, pays tribute to it without insulting its audience.<br />Never Give Up! Never Surrender!
B00005NI5Y|4.0|Perhaps more brilliant than &quot;Self Portrait&quot;. Quite arresting in fact. Enjoy my dear &quot;Dylanies&quot;.
6305907145|5.0|One of my favorite movies. The pacing and gentle flow of the movie, as well as the wonderful score, makes it a sublime work of art which gives me the chills whenever I watch it.
0517122707|4.0|As the typical Gemini, I understand both the reviews that hate this book &amp; the ones that love it.  I hated it for the first 100 pages.  Ignatius Reilly is such a self-centered, unattractive character that I wondered why anyone would write a 462 page book about him.  And in truth, he doesn't change from the beginning to the end of the book.  Is he insane or the classic iconoclast?  What Toole does brilliantly in this book is swirl a universe of minor characters and absurd events around Iggy.  The minor characters are extremely well defined from the mother to Santa the matchmaker to Dorian Greene the gay blade to Mancuso the addled policeman that we delight in the world that seems to swirl around Ignatius, just outside his much touted &quot;worldview.&quot;  If you hated this book, you're absolutely right because the main character takes the word &quot;jerk&quot; to a whole new level.  If you loved this book, you're also absolutely right because it is a story rich in detail, fresh in its outlook, even several decades after it was written.  This is a book that challenges us, tries our patience, and rewards us with a glimpse into the alternate universe known as New Orleans.  Good luck!
B0000041Z3|5.0|With only a slight apology to the traditional &quot;three B's&quot; of music, we might describe the pre-WWII 20-century in music as dominated by the three S's - Sibelius, Schoenberg and Stravinsky.<br />But where Schoenberg and Stravinsky were the highly publicized polar opposites of the tumultuous stylistic changes through the course of the 20th century, this was one march with which Sibelius did not feel obliged to keep step.  The fact is, for every composer who proclaimed that the only way for music to go was forward (or in some other &quot;interesting&quot; direction), there was another composer who - without simply (and lazily) &quot;re-writing&quot; the Music of the Past - quietly and calmly insisted that the roots of the past were needed, for the shoots of future growth.<br />Indeed, Stravinsky himself (though in his characteristically flamboyant manner) drew attention to the importance of the past, in the many famous pastiches of his Neo-Classical period.<br />The musical development of Sibelius had little to do with this argument of Who the Future of Music Belongs to;  indeed, for his own reasons, Sibelius was so disenchanted with the gap between what he felt his music ought to be doing, and what All the Musical Rage Was, that he struggled with an eighth symphony, put in a good deal of work on it, but at the last decided to destroy all trace of it.<br />My favorite among the Sibelius symphonies is probably the sixth.  There is a directness, and an economy of expression, which taken together with the instrumental ingenuity which characterizes all of his work, plus an affinity I have for his musical materials - al of this make the sixth one of my favorite symphonies, by any composer.<br />Notwithstanding the occasional quibble with slight infelicities of detail, there is fine musicianship which carries most of the symphonies in this set.  I find no particular disappointments in the sixth and seventh, and much to the contrary, I find these to be particularly convincing performances.  I think that Maazel's muscular, at times brisk, approach to Sibelius' work is truer to the composer's spirit than is the Ormandy whoosh.  Ironic that a fellow reviewer should mention Ormandy, as we do have an Ormandy recording of the Sibelius second;  for the most part, I far prefer Maazel on this set.<br />It is possible that more people are talking about the Mahler symphonies, and that more conductors are taking up more orchestral time with rehearsing and performing the Mahler symphonies; but apart from this superficial sense, there is no case to be made for Mahler's work \\"replacing\\" Sibelius'.  Mahler's work is easier to follow, and often has a maudlin, sentimental character with which it is easier for the average listener to \\"identify\\";  but Sibelius' music is well made, and uses the orchestra for the incredibly subtle and expressive macro-instrument which it is. Sibelius writes for the orchestra in a manner which enables a conductor to lead, and an orchestra to play, without any need for a medium to seek the composer out in a crystal ball to ask what he meant, really, by writing such-and-so a passage.<br />Sibelius is a great antidote to Mahler, for his work demonstrates that music can be exciting and emotional, without being antisocial and narcissistic.  There is something lastingly wholesome about Sibelius, and inescapably morbid about Mahler.<br />The Great Pendulum will turn again, and Mahler will be a footnote; and Sibelius will be the magnificent saga, seemingly rough-hewn, yet in fact carefully shaped and marvellously balanced.
B000002ITW|3.0|4-Way Street is an album that I've come back to after 20 years. I was curious to see what it sounded like today. Well, this album is divided into an acoustic set and an electric set. It was the acoustic side of the band that I have the fondest memories of, particularly David Crosby's 'Traid', the spine-tingling 'Lee Shore' and Graham Nash's 'Right Between the Eyes'. These songs still sound great - worth buying the record for alone, not forgetting Neil Young's acoustic contribution, 'Cowgirl in the Sand' (Neil comes off the best actually. His voice and style are so distinctive). The electric set is rather loose and some of it consists of pointless jamming so two stars off for that. The rest is superb. The stuff of really fond memories.

0451191153|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, and I'm thinking that I'm going to love the other Rand books I have yet to read.  This book is quite philosophical, so you are looking for a beach read, mystery, or simple romance, look elsewhere.  It is not for everyone, but if you read the first few pages, you will probably either find yourself hooked, or put it away fairly quickly.  <br />I was supposed to read this book as part of a special program in the third grade, but I'm very glad that I didn't, I probably would not have understood even a tenth of it.  The theme of the book is fairly serious, and as I mentioned before, very philosophical, so I doubt I would have gotten the full meaning back then.  It's a huge book, but I spent every spare minute I had reading it, and it just took me a couple of days.  It is a wonderful book and provides a very insightful look into the human spirit in its various forms, and how it can either shape or be shaped by society.  I already have my copy of Atlas Shrugged, and will undoubtedly be reading it soon.  If you are a fan of Ayn Rand's books, don't miss this one!  If you're not, you probably won't like this one either.

After the apparent suicide of a book collector, Corso is called in to authenticate the fragment of Alexandre Dumas's &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; that's been left behind. Then Corso is hired for a mysterious job involving a book whose creator was burned at the stake for heresy. The two plots converge and blend, leaving Corso bewildered and fighting for his life as those involved die in the wake of contact with Corso. He gets help from a mystery woman named for a woman in a Sherlock Holmes story, but at what cost does this help come? Fully intertextual and entirely mesmerizing, Prez-Reverte's thriller presents enigmas wrapped in mysteries that, when solved, leave the audience breathless. While I too had problems with the way the book ended, after reading the ending again, it makes perfect sense to me in the scope of the story presented here. I was a fan of the movie version, &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;, until I read this book. Yes, the movie is pretty good taken by itself, but as an adaption it fails.
630451087X|5.0|David Lynch did it again!!!After a long break from the Twin Peaks series/movie,David Lynch directed this amazing movie that envolves murder/sex/suspense e of curse all the bizarre types you can imagine.This movie remembers a little of the Blue Velvet,the music and the actors,its the David Lynch formula of suspense again,but its not borring.And when the movie ends you wanna see it again 'cos it makes you think what the hell happen.<BR>A movie you shouldn't miss...you must buy it!
B00005QZWI|4.0|I like this a lot. But the movie's lack of characterization does not let me revel in remembrance while listening to this soundtrack, as I like to do with soundtracks to great movies. It is beautiful in itself, however, and Enya enhances it very well without making it a New Age score. Good buy; get the cheaper version...
0062502182|5.0|a brilliantly written book but you need to have the patience, &quot;hence why good things come to those who wait&quot;.  If you are lost in life's race then i would suggest reading this book and others related.  It can give you the kind of direction where general notice boards can often mislead you.  much too regularly you miss life and its different components which make a &quot;you&quot;.  take your time and enjoy the ride, the only person who has put a time limit on you is yourself.
B00005Q3TZ|3.0|Even though this movie from the military ( Miller is addressed as a Petty Officer before the attack occured) and historic aspects does not reach a 5 star I still found it very interesting to watch and quite enjoyed it. I have to admit even though I am a woman I was not that enchanted with the lovestory. Yes it was cute, but so predictable and it took up way too much time in the movie that would have been better spent on &quot; real&quot; characters. I am married to the Military and my husband is a Military Pilot, so  I got the real thing and maybe know better. If you want a real documentary on the events that took place in Pearl Harbor I recommend the National Geographic Documentary. However I know there are a lot of uneducated people out there that either don't want to or don't care to watch educational shows. For them this might be the perfect movie to learn at least a glimpse of how America entered WWII. Most people have heard the term Pearl Harbor, but never really knew what had happened and how devestating and destructive it was. The things I really liked in the movie are the fantastic cinematographie, fantastic flight scenes and the way the attack itself was portrayed.
0395759242|2.0|These are of course very difficult subjects to sleuth out, but.....<br />His analysis of estimated people killed in Congo (5-8  million) is less than rigorous.<br />Likewise, rigorous analysis of what ($) Leopold put into the Congo vs. what he took out is lacking.  Was this a successful venture for Leopold financially (on a return-on-investment basis)?  Maybe or maybe not, but  Hockschild does not prove it by pointing out that  Leopold put up a few statues and built a wing on his chateau.......Leo was't exactly poor to begin with.
0446608955|5.0|this book is really good... Sparks does a great job of writing his books... I wish he had more books about teens since I am one.  It was really sad but it was really well written and this is a must read
B00003CY0V|4.0|This seems to be one of those movies that all critics pan and most audiences are pleasantly surprised by.  I was not going to see it at first for the bad reviews, but everyone I talked to liked it.  I do agree that Halle Barry's nude scene was unecessary, particularly because nothing blossoms between her and Jackman, although we just don't know: it certainly did help to instill empathy within the men of the audience during the scene in question.  I enjoyed the special effects; the opening scene featuring the 360-degree ball bearing explosion was particularly breathtaking, and the air-lifted bus scene, while not heart-pounding edge-of-your-seat excitement, presented enough novelty and sheer wackiness to be highly enjoyable.  The end is one of those calculated twists that has been unfortunately worn out in the aftermath of The Usual Suspects, but it does work.<BR>Bottom line: I do indeed recommend this movie, despite its bad press, and I'm not denying that it's a guilty pleasure.  If you look at this movie piece by piece, as critics tend to do, it doesn't seem like much, but upon viewing it emerges as more that the sum of its parts.  It's really a pretty good movie.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Jimi Hendrix lived a short life, but if that can be resolved in anyway, it's that he produced some of the best music I have heard in my young life. People always seem amazed that me, a teenage girl, would listen to this kind of music. I myslef don't know why I love it, I just do. My parents never listened to Jimi, saying he's too loud and repetitive, but they obviously never listened for more than a song and a half. I just recently got into Jimi Hendrix, and I can say that this has probably been one of the most inspiring choices I've ever made. Jimi's music has opened my eyes, not only towards the world itself, but also the world of music. His song &quot;Castles Made Of Sand&quot; inspired me to start playing guitar, and now I can play that and &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. This album itself is great, with many of my favourite songs, including &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; (I hate it when people call it Voodoo Chile!) and &quot;Crosstown Traffic&quot;, and of course that Hendrix classic &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot;. It disappoints me that there is only one &quot;best of&quot; album, for he had many more good songs. But by far the most disappointing thing, (which has nothing to do with quality), is that not enough people are listening to this lyrical genius. People are too stuck up in the pop music and rap images to even care about quality. Half the people in my school have never even heard of AC/DC, let alone Jimi Hendrix! I just want to say that this cd is great, and that everyone should at least try Jimi Hendrix once, just once. Try him, you might love it, just like I did. And remember, Jimi Hendrix was and always WILL be a God, in his own right.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I reluctantly sold my original DVD of Almost Famous and bought<BR>this Bootleg Cut. Great decision! Thirty of the 35 minutes of new<BR>material was great stuff--not cutting room floor sweepings.

0679446230|4.0|THINGS FALL APART begins fable-like, telling us a story of Okonko, who is almost a Homeric hero. Honor and masculinity are integral to his character, and what he perceives in his father as laziness and femininity no doubt plays a role in his concern for these qualities. Two major events cause a major change in his life. As a result of an accident, he is cast out of his village for seven years. The other event is the coming of Europeans and their spreading of Christianity.<br />There is little idealized in the town of Umuofia, where Okonko lives. The lives of the portrayed characters is not shown to be either easy or humane. And the missionaries in this book don't bring pure evil. The converts are converted of their own accord, and due to a trading store, &quot;much money flowed into Umuofia.&quot; This book is fortunately free of moralizing. Things fall apart, but new ways are formed, and these ways may be better or worse than the old ways. Still, Achebe's novel is not blind to the destruction that the missionaries bring, and the brutality of their increasing power, which is moving towards domination.<br />Achebe shows skillfully the dilemmas and problems of two cultures clashing that misunderstand each other. I just watched Nicolas Roeg's film &quot;Walkabout&quot; a few days ago, and though they are quite different stories, they have many parallels, such as the curious ending scene. More importantly, the theme of the mystery of culture, and destruction and self-destruction remain the same. In an age where globalization seems to be the key economic topic, it is crucial that we understand the variety of life on earth, the histories we are involved in, and the need for communication and understanding.
B00003CX9S|5.0|This film deals with a theme that is close to all of us, that of a misunderstood man whose shining inner being redeems himself, as well as those around him.  Heroic stuff.   This theme has been dealt with throughout the history of film (The Hunchback of Notre Dame, On The Waterfront, ad infinitum) on various levels and in various scenarios, and has nearly always presented the audience with a cathartic experience that can change the way we look at ourselves and others.  There is something very spiritual in &quot;The Elephant Man,&quot; an essence that digs deep into the human psyche, far deeper than those films that seek to merely manipulate us by tugging at our collective heart strings.  The film's visual quality, the industrial audio textures, the gorgeous musical score, the sensitive acting by masters of the craft--these all add up to a true masterpiece, something that is rarely seen in films of the '80's and '90's.  What's more, the DVD provides us with a rendering of a piece of art that is finally worth its salt, well deserving of the rave reviews regarding the outstanding image quality. And one more thing: the extras on this disc are splendid, and I don't give a hoot in Poughkeepsie whether the disc is separated into chapters.  So there!
0553573403|5.0|The other reviewers have already touched on the highlights, so let me just say that this is one of the only (series of) books I've ever bought in hardback.  Worthy of my bookshelf and worthy of my time (I'm stingy w/ both!)  If you open the pages, I believe G. Martin will dazzle you as well.
B000002UJQ|5.0|In this music lovers opinion (over 500 cds, avid fan of just about everything out there), OK Computer is not the best album of the 90's.  It is the best album of all time.  Personally, no other music hits me the way this album does.  I've listened to it many times over the past few years, yet every time is still just like the first time.  The lyrics are cryptic and majestic, making sense and nonsense at the same time, itching to be dissected and pondered.  The music is beautiful, eerie, catchy, epic..timeless, really.  If you haven't heard this album yet, you are in for one of the biggest treats of your music-fan life.  It'll leave you speechless after the first listen, and it only gets better.  Read some more of these reviews, get your curiosity bubbling to a peak, then go out and get this cd.  Watch how fast this cd climbs the ranks of vh1 and mtv's &quot;best of all time&quot; lists as the years go on.  Perhaps it's still too soon to reap such an accolade on this album, but it deserves the title nonetheless.  Better than Dark Side.  Better than Sgt. Pepper and Revolver.  Better than Pet Sounds.  Better than Nevermind.  Get it now and fall in love with music all over again.
B000001FRY|5.0|This album, along with a number of other records such as The Clash's London Calling, heralded the beginning of the '80s.  There is not a weak track here, whether it be Stories for Boys, A Day without You or Electric Co.  Besides great lyrics, they all really rock.  This record really lacks the pomp and bombast that to some degree permiates the newer stuff, such as All That You Can't leave behind.  These guys may have been young and naive, but even then there was a message they were determined to deliver.  This is an essential edition to any comprehensive music collection.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Sure, I've heard it all before: Star Trek - The MotionLESS Picture.  (Yeah, ha ha.  You're such a card!)<br />Out of all the other Star Trek movies and TV series, this movie is unique.  It features the original cast before they got too old, the BEST musical score of any ST movie, a take on the Star Trek &quot;universe&quot; that hasn't been repeated, and don't forget those cool space jammies!  (The refreshing lack of space-jargon that clutters up all the later TV series is also a nice change of pace!)  <br />Lots of people decry this film with charges of it being boring.  This film has a slower pace than most modern films, but it also offers the viewer to be amazed at the beauty and scope of the cosmos.  Most modern SF films are all mindless action.  It's refreshing to enjoy a movie that has wondrous visual images, a positive message, and Jerry Goldsmith's incredible musical score!<br />The &quot;Director's Edition&quot; of STTMP features this film in a form that more resembles Robert Wise's original vision.  The changes are subtle and enhance the movie.  They don't distract from it like the updated Star Wars films.  (And for those of us who want to still see the original film elements, they are included on the bonus disk.)  Mr. Wise has taken the original 1979 film,<BR>added the crucial scenes from the 1983 TV version, and edited the film into a more comprehensive whole.  <br />The parts added to the film were originally intended to be part of it back in 1979 (they were fully &quot;storyboarded&quot; way back then).  Time constraints and technical limitations of the late 1970's prevented them from being included at that time.  Because the release date was set in stone, Mr. Wise never had the time to see what worked (and what didn't) in the film and then re-edit the movie into what he truly wanted.  This is why he went back and &quot;fixed&quot; certain parts for DVD.  <br />A few reviews on these pages are lamenting that Robert Wise made the film &quot;less&quot; somehow because he cut out certain parts.  I admit, I hate tampering with classic films (Why George Lucas now has Han Solo shooting Greedo &quot;in self-defense&quot; in Star Wars is beyond me!).  I would have been upset if the deleted scenes weren't included on the bonus disk.  But, when you watch the missing scenes, you realize that they didn't really propel the story at all.  Watch the movie, then look at the stuff that was cut.  You'll see that it wasn't missed.<br />I've seen this movie more than any of the others.  Why?  Well, *liking* it more than the others may be a start, but it's also due to STTMP's &quot;epic&quot; nature.  While the later films in the series are good, they don't have the same visual appeal (space jammies notwithstanding!), nor do they have Jerry Goldsmith's wonderful STTMP score!  <br />This DVD collection is well worth the money.
B00004Z459|5.0|this cd was excellent.  i listened to it from start to finish without having to skip tracks to find a cool songs like i might do with a diffrent cd.
0385505833|5.0|I cannot say enough about this book. IT IS GREAT!!!!! I have read some of Mr. Grisham's earlier novels and was anxious to see his talents in a story about my favorite holiday season. AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.  In fact, I plan to purchase this delightful and VERY funny book to read every year. I laughed out loud at the antics of the main characters to the point of tears! I have recommended the book to perfect strangers as well to all my friends. I certainly hope that the story is set up on the big screen where we can see it played out in 'reality'. However, while it may seem to some of the readers(reviewers, a story liking to 'a National Lapoon', I upgrade it. The only ones who would do THIS justice would be Steve Martin and Diane Keaton in the title roles. But enough about that. READ THE BOOK!! You'll laugh out loud. John Grisham has you seeing the characters. I LOVED IT!!!
B00005QY5Y|4.0|There is no doubt that Ryan Adam's star is shining very brightly indeed.After the stunning solo debut and the excellent delayed release of Whiskeytown's &quot;Pneumonia&quot;,you sort of wondered how he'd keep the standard so high.I've had this album now for several months and I've sort of been resrving judgement.I mean the glorification of the initial reviews sort of turned me off if anything.I think they raised my expectations just too high and I was a bit disappointed when I first heard the album.Now after time I can say I really  like it an awful lot-even though I wouldn't describe it as quite a classic.<br /> The influences on this album have been spoken about quite often in the music press and on this website.As one previous reviewer said in an excellent review-Adam's influences are a sign that he's guilty of having a great taste in music.Lots of blues,lots of alt/country.Sometimes he reminds me of the Stones,songs like &quot;La Cienaga Just Smiled&quot; reminds me of Springsteen's Tunnel Of Love.In my opinion he sounds like a ringer for Roy Orbison on the track &quot;Somehow,Someday&quot;.There are catchy songs like the blues/rock track &quot;New York,New York&quot;.Track 9 &quot;Sylvia Plath&quot; is a haunting beautiful tale with just piano and strings-it reminds me of a Joe Henry track from his Trampoline c.d.He paints an amazing character and gives her great depth-yet the feeling of lonliness is startling.&quot;Wildflowers&quot; has Adam's voice sounding so fragile and tender and then he changes style for a heartwarming and almost rousing chorus.&quot;Nobody's Girl&quot; may last for well over 9 minutes,but it's another soothing and constantly interesting track.The guitar work is so good on this track.His vocal style on &quot;Rescue Blues&quot; is also excellent,especially in the hoarse delivery of some of the higher notes-totally suitable for late night radio.The fifties style rock sound of track 11 is a welcome break from the album's quieter moments.Theone great thing about this album is that despite the fact there are 16 tracks-the high quality of the songs is relentless.<br /> Adam's I think will go on to become one of music's major  'newish' superstars of this new century.I hope Wilco give us an album this year to match what Adam's has done recently.I'm now hooked on all his work and I can't wait to see what he does next.He's been so prolific recently though,I wonder will we have a long wait?
0452282152|4.0|How delightful it was to spend a dreary afternoon lost among the sloping streets and shimmering canals of Delft with Griet!  I found this book to be a delightful meld of the literary and the artistic world, as Chevalier &quot;paints&quot; a colorful history of a somewhat exasperating girl.  I admit, at first I was a bit trepidatious of reading a book that dealt with painting, and Vermeer's paintings at that, in a literary form.  How was the author going to capture the incredible skill, and beauty of a painting with words?  I extend my congratulations, for Ms. Chevalier did just that.  Somehow, she managed to meld the words into a medium that conveyed artistic flair, perhaps grinding her ingredients just as Greit did, into a paint that she splashed on the pages.  Her descriptions of Delft, and the houses surrounding the canal I found to be a surprisingly perfect setting for this story.  I recommend this quick, but engaging read for a cold day and a hot cup of tea.
B000001F3C|5.0|Steve gave us the sound of U2 and Big Country (RIP Stuart Adamson).  That guitar sound we love is a combo of Edge's chords and Lillywhite production.  This album, along with Boy and October, were a trilogy of angry anthems from a band on the verge of superstardom.  Now 20 years has passed and Sunday Bloody Sunday is still just as powerful.  The whole world has changed.  So has the sound of U2.  This was the end of their first phase....don't forget.
B00005JKT8|5.0|I loved this movie! It fallows a guy leapold from 1700s in his jouney in the 2000s.  he falls in love with kate (meg ryan) but unfortuanitaly has to return to the 1700s and doesnt want to leave due to kate. Nobody belives that leapold is truely from the past.  You will fall in love with megs adorable out of work actor brother who befriends leapold.  THis is a perfect date movie, it is a comedy- and a romance, but not the kind u need to bring a roll of toilet paper to.  i am deffinitly buying this when it comes out on dvd
B00005JKQX|4.0|It was a huge mistake for the makers of &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; to ignore John Nash's homosexuality and mistreatment of his illegitimate son.  The John Nash brilliantly portrayed by Russell Crowe is nowhere near as complex and interesting as the actual man.  The excuse that they must leave certain aspects out due to time limitations does not suffice.  Did the marketing executives have too power over the final cut?  If so, what were they thinking?  A film such as this one is likely to attract only those sophisticated enough to easily handle the more controversial aspects of Nash's life.<br />Still, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is worth seeing.  Russell Crowe, as a genius suffering from the mental disease of schizophrenia, has earned another Academy Award nomination, and reminds us once again that he may be the greatest male film actor of our time.  I am simply in awe regarding his stupendous ability to truly get under the skin of his character.  Many other actors essentially play the same role over and over.  In Crowe's case, though, each movie is a special treat and a journey into the unknown.  Jennifer Connelly as Nash's wife is beautiful to look, but I sense that the real Alicia Nash is quite a bit different in person.  Paul Bettany and Ed Harris are challenged to play the parts of men who are imaginary.  They succeed admirably, and provide another reason to view this film.  Congratulations are also in order for the efforts of both Judd Hirsh and Christopher Plummer.  The cast selections were near perfect, and visually &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; captures the era between the 1950s and the year when Nash won the Nobel Prize.<br />This movie doesn't deserve five stars, but I have no hesitation in giving it four.  Russell Crowe once again saves the day.  One should always go out of their way to observe a master in action.  You won't be disappointed.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This is my favorite Star Wars movie (followed closely by all).  All the actors give amazing performances (especially Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor...as Amidala and Obi-Wan).  I like all the subtle humor Lucas puts into his movies along with the adventure, suspense, great story, and amazing effects.  Everyone has been critizing Jar-Jar, but he adds some comedy when the story needs it.  Jake Lloyd as Anikan is a decent actor (as much as you can ask from a 10 year old).  I am very excited for the next film, no matter what the name is!  ~Meg<BR>P.S.  This is also a great movie to drool over Ewan McGregor!
0425170349|1.0|... but for the love of God, stay away from this one.  You can do so much better than this, a book that reads as if one of his \\"Op-Center\\" co-authors wrote it.  In the beginning, there was \\"The Hunt for Red October\\", a taut, intense action read.  300-some pages of absolutely gripping story, the sort you don't put down unless it's 5 in the morning and you've gotta work tomorrow.  Then, other ones (great, good, all-right... but at least readable).  But apparently the end of the Soviet Union as an antagonist has left Tom bereft of evildoers more realistic than Oddjob or Dr. Evil.  So now we have 1,000-plus pages of the most ridiculous terrorist scenarios conceivable (see also \\"Executive Orders\\"-- just as bad), ones that seem all the more absurd when juxtaposed with the horror of September 11.  I won't give away the plot, but suffice it to say that if you're into Clancy, or want to be, start at the beginning (with \\"Red October\\", in my opinion his best), and read his work in chronological order.  When you get to \\"Debt of Honor\\", read it (if only for the 'at-the-time-it-seemed-so-implausible' ending) then go back to the ones you liked before.  Do. Not. Read. Any. Farther.  You will only be disappointed.
B00005NGSE|4.0|I owned the vinyl before there even were cds and I felt then, and now, that the performance is much better than the recording. Uli John roth absolutely steals the show with his blistering lead guitar riffs.  He was so much better than Mathias Jabs.  At this time, they were a blues based hard rock band.  To me, this was their peak artistically.  Tracks like Speedy's Coming, We Burn the Sky, Fly to the Rainbow, and Robot Man are blistering.  And, get the import double disc with ALL tracks.
B00004Z400|5.0|Without a doubt, this is probably the most violent and disturbing albums one could ever listen to - and it draws you in quitely ...and I love it. Its like stepping into the mind of a psycho killer. Unlike most music today, where you are to be a passive observer - just entertain me dude - this album brings you into the dark vision and makes you an active participant. The deeper you go, the more your skin will start to crawl. This is creative work at its best, and the uncomfortable feelings that it induces could be compared to the movie 12 Monkeys. It pulls out of you real feelings of pain. The song that clued me into the disturbing vision is the song &quot;knife prty&quot; - with the beautiful voice of the singer turn into a stomach aching screams. But all the songs on the album share such violence and dark themes - Great job!
B00005QJDG|5.0|Live Scenes from New York is a must have for true Dream Theater fans. I have always been impressed by these guys in studio and in concert, and the things they do with this album are astounding. Three CDs is a lot of music, making this an extremely good value. This extended concert has the entire &quot;Metropolis part 2&quot; as well as some additions from other albums and a touch of Liquid Tension Experiment. I can also get a good sense of the superb musicianship of Jordan Rudess from his solo and there are a lot of live &quot;additions&quot; from Mike and John. Mike Portnoy is the rock drummer to listen to now for anyone missing Neil Peart during the extended departure of Rush. If you enjoy progressive rock than anything by Dream Theater is a must have, but I believe this to be their best live album.
0684867621|5.0|I have read many mysteries and terror novels before, however, I feel that this book is more interesting than the others. It is about a nine-year-old girl called Trisha; her parents are divorced and now she now lives with her mother and her older brother, Peter. Trisha is deeply in love with a player named Tom Gordon; she always feels that he is with her. One weekend when her mother takes her and Peter out for picnic, somehow Trisha does not follow the trail with her mother and is lost in the woods. She was frightened and worried. However, she still believes that Tom Gordon is standing besides her and he is leading her to the right pathway. This book describes in depth all the horror and terror of being lost in the woods, and how alone a little girl would really feel in this situation. I like how the author conveys this girl&iexcl;¦s love for the player, even though she is lost in the woods, she has the feeling that he is still with her. Her strong feelings for Tom Gordon are realistic and the book shows how a nine-year-old girl really thinks. When she is lost in the woods, the author uses many ways to convey the fear of what might happen, and also allows the reader to experience what it feels like to be lost in the forest alone.<br /> When I was reading this book, I would sometimes think and ask myself<br />&iexcl;§If I were this girl, would I be as brave as her, or would I be terribly afraid?&iexcl;¨<br />It made me think about being alone and how I could cope. I enjoyed reading this book and enjoyed the fear of being in the woods.
B00005JKES|5.0|the film transfer is a-maze-ing! previously i had only seen the show via the vhs boxed set that has super crummy tapes which were recorded in EP mode. those tapes were 5 hours long and easily lost their charge thus degrading the picture quality each time you rewound and played back to see the nuances. the DVD has very sharp and clear picture and sound which gives way to finding even more nuances and the breath taking music sounds even better in 5.1 DTS. <BR>my only gripe (and it could just be that i am some sort of idiot) is that the controls are a bit funky. i still haven't been able to access the script notes on my computer DVD player. i just figured out how the chapter navigation works. the overall visual ellegance of the design and the clunkiness of navigation seem out of sync. some of the supplemental features (like the documentary and black lodge speak) are poorly produced as well. these things aside i give it five stars because of the packaging, the transfer, the sound mix, and the visual aspects of it's design. let's rock.
B000002UB6|5.0|There may be no Beatles album that sparked a larger controversy and recieved larger backlash then their final release (not album, release) Let it Be. However once you sit down and listen to it, you'll realize that whoever bashed it knows nothing about music.<br />When it all comes down to it Let it Be is the Beatles still being the greatest rock band in the universe! It is melodic, rocking, and boasts magnificent songwriting. It contains such Beatles essentials as Let it Be (next to Hey Jude the greatest Beatles song ever!), Across the Universe (One of John Lennon's finest moments as a songwriter), Get Back (Addictive driving beat and great lyrics), Two of Us (An underated folk rock classic), Dig a Pony (Another magnificent example of Lennon songcraft), For You Blue (Some of the finest guitar work on a Beatles song), and I've Got A Feeling (a two parter that you won't beable to get out of your mind). If it weren't for the project being so sloppily concieved and Phil Spector's overproduction on certain numbers (No Beatle fan can forgive Phil Spector's for his abomination of a could have been classic Long and Winding Road.) this would have been raved as an all time rock classic. But apparently this Beatles album can only settle for being excellent.<br />So if you were to hesitate on purchasing this album because of some bad reviews you'd be sadly mistaken. Phil Specter or no Phil Spector, inter band turmoil or no inter band turmoil, this is a Beatles album. And there are no bad Beatles album. Buy it right NOW!
B00005LMBK|3.0|I'm not sure why so many people here are lavishing 5 stars on this album. Don't get me wrong- it's good, but it's not great. Although, it's certainly much better than most of the stuff being peddled as \\"alternative\\" these days. The tracks are far too disimilar, and the ride is a bit too bumpy for my tastes. It seems almost as if three artists worked on tracks separately, and then threw them all together to make a single album. IE- \\"Latin Simone\\",\\"Clint Eastwood\\", and \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\" all have a very similar feel- right down to the dub melodica, while the rest of the album sounds as if it was done by different artists altogether. <br />The tracks that are good on this album are very good, but most of them leave me feeling disappointed that the music wasn't pushed further. There are some good ideas here, but it seems as if they were afraid to explore them as far as they could. <br />Overall, it's a good disc for freshman listeners, but I can't recommend it to those with discriminating tastes, (or to anyone hoping for a landmark album ala DJ Shadow's \\"Endtroducing.\\")
0446677450|5.0|I am amazed at the negative reviews of this book.  It seems that most of the reviews focus on the obvious shortcomings of the book, namely the poor writing style and incomplete suggestions for obtaining wealth.  What few seem to note is that this book teaches you to get out of the &quot;rat race&quot; and stop consuming.  It challenges you to look at assets and liabilities differently and makes one realize the tremendous risks of being dependent on an employer their whole life.  Take the good from this book and it while change your life.  Could it be that the CPA's don't like this book because it's at cross purposes with the advice they give about buying a bigger house for a better tax write-off?  Look at the book for what it is, not what it isn't.  It is WELL worth the $15.  I've given copies to my entire family and some of my friends.  A very worthwhile read....if you're tired of being a slave to money.  Otherwise, don't bother.
0380715430|4.0|This is a fun book.<br />Author Bill Bryson is best known for his travelogues. This book is an eclectic survey of the English language:  its origins, evolution, borrowings from other languages, pronunciation and more.  Through the book, Bryson's trademark humor is present.  Although this book has less laughs per page than &quot;A Walk in the Woods,&quot; it features Bryson's wonderful wit and leaves out the sarcasm that made some of his earlier efforts less than par.<br />Bryson clearly loves and respects the power of English.  Perhaps alone among major languages, English developed without official sanction in the fields and streets of early medieval England, where the court spoke Norman French.  Looked down upon, it was free to flourish and find expression for how most people really lived their lives.<br />This lack of officialdom during its birth and early rearing left us with wacky spelling and a few other eccentricities.  But it also greatly simplified the language by, for example, eliminating the masculine and feminine articles inherent in French and the large number of verb forms associated with other descendents of Latin.<br />It also picked up more words and thus maintains a larger vocabulary than its European rivals, according to the author.  This has given English the ability to richly texture speech and writings and provide a sublime ability to distinguish expression and thought more so than one is able to do in many other languages.<br />This is not a textbook, although it does pack a lot of serious information and linguistic discussions of the technical aspects of language.  In a few chapters, Bryson relies too much on long lists to show his examples.  This wears only a little and is buffeted by his humor throughout.  Particularly interesting and enjoyable are his discourses on swearing, word games and improbable place names (like Maggies' Nipples, a town in Wyoming and Coldass Creek, located in North Carolina).<br />This book is very enjoyable and informative.rmative.
0385505833|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is not your typical Grisham book but is a delight to read. Other reviews state that it is not true to reality and misses the mark in accuracy. Well, people have you ever heard of an imagination? This book was a great story to make you think about skipping important things in ones life. Skipping Christmas is a wonderful book to read and enjoy!<br />I highly recommend this book!
B000007638|5.0|Fantastic effort by a well rehersed group.  Re-mastering would add greatly, especially to disc two, but put it on and crank it up,you will not be disapointed.  A bit pricey???

B0000399WC|5.0|Steve McQueen gives what has got to be the performance of his career. It is truly a shame he was not even nominated. The color and quality of the film on DVD is truly amazing. This is a stark yet beautiful film full of adventure and pathos. Any and all fans of great acting(McQueen and Hoffman)and breathtaking filmmaking will not want to miss this.
6304466498|5.0|All of Mel Brooks' films are great, but this has to be one of his best! This and Blazing Saddles (Also directed by Mel Brooks) are my 2 all-time favorite movies.
B000002I2G|2.0|Es stinky!  I suspect some marketing &quot;genius&quot; decided the Doors needed to sound like Chicago, the Outsiders or some of the other brass pop bands.  I bought it only because I can't find &quot;Runnin' Blues&quot; anywhere else and I'm compiling a CD version of &quot;Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine,&quot; a 1972 compilation on LP.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This in tandem with Kid A is one of the finest music experiences of my life.  Do not do anything else while listening to these albums; they demand your full attention - and deliver a near out-of-body experience in return.
B00003CXBK|1.0|I first saw Princess Mononoke when it came out in theaters. With all of the hype, I was expecting something wonderful. The first thing I noticed was the good animation. The second thing was the flat, miscast voice acting. The third was the bleeding heart mumbo-jumbo story. Half way through the show I realized that I didnt care about any of the characters. The wolves were boring. The male hero whispered all of his lines like he was too cool to show any emotion. None of the monsters sounded cool (Not even any extra snorting for the attacking worm infested pig!). The best performance goes to the princess. Joe Bob didnt sound anything like he looked on screen. I dont know, I love anime, but I got so bored that I walked out before it was over. Don't believe the hype!
6305342768|2.0|THE MOVIE IS REALLY NOT SO GREAT, BUT IT'S REALLY NOT SO BAD EITHER. I GUESS YOU JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS MADE TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT ISN'T AS TECHNICAL AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN. THEY PUSH THIS AS A KID'S MOVIE AND MANY OF US SAW IT AS KIDS... DOWNRIGHT SCARY!!!!!
0446677450|4.0|Robert T. Kiyosaki presents us with a book where some concepts of Stephen Covey (7 Habits) and Emotional Intelligence resound, but constrained within the bounds of personal finances. Concepts such as not letting emotions such as fear rule over your financial decisions (easier said than done, most of the time), postponing immediate gratification, and responding with a proactive mind (and a proactive language) in the face of financial adversity, are examples of this.<br />However the author has some contributions which might shock you both for their originality as much as for how the go against what's established as acceptable. Yet that's what makes the book as appealing (or discouraging for some).<br />We all agree (I hope) that money is not taught in schools, not money management at the personal level, at least. And when/where it's taught, in general it's with a great deal of care, avoiding risk. Well, the book teaches you how to manage risk, how to take calculated risks. What for? In order to make money WORK for you and have you get out of the Rat Race. This can be better understood by thinking of how to create enough wealth within your assets (and he doesn't count the home you're living in as one, so that you can begin counting it out) to pay for your monthly living expenses, so that you don't need to depend on a job for that, which is the case of most of us. The kind of assets he talks about are businesses that do not require your presence, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, income-generating real estate, etc.<br />The book also goes to some extent into some of the advantages of incorporating your own corporation, but it is by no means an exhaustive guide on the topic; it goes into why you should work not for money, but in order to learn. To have each job as a learning ground on which you can build skills which you can later use for yourself as you run your own corporation or company. Does this sound a little selfish? It might be, and that's another paradigm which thebook attempts to break: to mind your own business, meaning to do what you have to, but not to loose sight of your financial goal. The author's point is to make the best of each work experience and learn as much as possible from each. Learn about the management of cash flow, systems and people as the key skills needed for success later on.<br />As for negatives, one thing I found about the book was that it could have used some more editing. At times the author suddenly jumps between thoughts from one paragraph to the next. Ironically enough he admits in the book that he's not one hell of a writer (and that's OK), but the editor could have done a better job. The other thing is the level of the book. When you're done with it, hopefully (as it did for me) it leaves you thinking, which is a good thing, but it also leaves you with a bunch of questions. My guess is that the author just wouldn't give out the entire 'enchilada' to you in one book (after all he's a business man!) so some of the answers can be found in other books of his, or written by his associates (other authors of the Rich Dad series). Other than these two things, I found the book interesting, useful and quick to read (doesn't <BR>take anything else beyond an open mind).
B00004XONN|5.0|Some of the music here is very ambient/atmospheric (especially \\"Treefingers\\" and \\"How to Dissapear Completely\\"). and some is pretty strange, and experimental (especially the title track). In Limbo, Optimistic, Morning Bell, and Idioteque are the best on here.<br /> Why didn't Radiohead release any videos or singles for this? They wanted to prove that they didn't need MTV to overplay their videos so it could sell good and they sure proved that. Also, they were going to make Kid A and Amnesiac into a double album but decided not to, and Amnesiac came out only 8 months after Kid A so they didn't have time to make videos. Although I would've liked videos for Idioteque and Optimistic, (They would've made very succesful ones) Radiohead made a smart decision with that. The songs are still amazing.
0790749815|4.0|One of Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces. It has so much in it. It has class, sophistication, humour, tension, sexiness, all in a great plot.<br />Although a bit dated, it stands up well to watching and rewatching, there is so much in it.<br />The documentary accompanying the film narrated by Eve Marie Saint gives fantastic insights into the behind-the scenes goings on with one of our great filmmakers.
B000021YQV|4.0|I like SOAD because their music is so different from anything. &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; Is actually not one of my favorite songs here. I think &quot;Prison Song&quot; is the best, and i like &quot;Toxicity&quot; and &quot;Forest&quot;. Very original to say the least... I don't even listen to the song Chop Suey, because I'm sick of hearing it now. But the rest of the songs are worth it. Just because they got overly popular on MTV doesnt mean theyre bad. Usually it does though. ;/
0525946284|5.0|A book more in the vein of &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; than his more light-weight recent efforts, this book is a major event for us Follett fans.  It is a real page-turner, with the usual Follett detail that we have come to expect.  A real winner.  &quot;Eye&quot; is my favorite Follett spy/intrigue work, with &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; being, in my opinion, a very under-rated effort.  This book doesn't approach the majesty of &quot;Pillars&quot;, but it is definitely in Follett's top five or six.
B000002N2Z|5.0|I can't even describe how good this is. The first album is a lot more 'raw'. I've read these reviews a lot and each person's favorite songs are different. The obvious best are 7 words and engine No. 9, but i give all these songs 5 stars, none of them are weak and I enjoy them all equally. When they named this album, they named it very accordingly, because it gets your adrenaline pumping when you listen to it. Chino's singing is incredible, he sings with a lot of emotion and anger. And the guitar riffs are also incredible. Even the way he screams is incredible. The music is so original and intense. I've only had this for about 5 months, but it feels like forever, and it will probably never get old. If you don't have this what the HELL are you waiting for.
6303022901|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful films - and the music just gets me every time; as a filmmaker, I give this film 10 stars; must see for all - especially mothers and daughters of all races!
B00005B36H|5.0|With Lateralus, Tool has gone in a bit of a softer direction. But it is still amazing. There are still some heavy songs like Ticks &amp; Leeches and Parabola. With this album they sound alot more Progressive. It is not the type of music you hear for the first time and start headbanging to, it takes a long time for the songs to climax. (maybe even a few listens) The fillers on here are not like on Aenima and flow perfectly between the songs. The fillers on Aenima are just stoopid. (Even though i still like Aenima beter, overall) Mantra gives you this creppy feeling and Schism right after that just flows perfectly. Same with Parabol+Parabola. The 11 minutes of Disposition will just take you away to another dimention. Reflection sounds a lot different from anything. And Triad is the best damn instrumental track My ears have experienced. All the songs are pretty unique, and stuff. What else Can I say? The only song I don't really like is &quot;The Patient&quot;. My favorites are Lateralus and Schism, but I enjoy every song. This is another classic Tool album in the collection.
B000002BUY|5.0|i am a fan of incubus, i wouldn't say a particularly huge fan, but this in my opinion is their best album!  well i can't really say that cos i have only got this, 'morning view', 'make yourself' and 'enjoy incubus', but out of them i feel this is the best!  i prefer this to the latest two because i feel it is harder and funkier than 'make yourself' and 'morning view'.  i am actually going to see them this friday at manchester and i can't wait!  and i am really hoping they play a big mix of their songs and not just stuff off 'morning view', but anyway that has nothing to do with this review so i will get on with it!  if you wanna download to check them out i would recommend downloading any of the first six songs!!  they are all brilliant, but i love all of those songs!!  so yeah if you like funky, hard, original music then you should get this now!  ...
6302293553|5.0|One of the best Monty Python movies, and a great comedy besides. Lots of memorable scenes and dialogue. I think I should have waited and bought the DVD version though.
0385505833|3.0|John Grisham takes a fairly simple premise and weaves it into a short, yet worthwhile title. It may not stand up with his other books, but you could do far worse. It reads well and \\"omits needless words\\" to keep the boredom down. A Christmas Carol is a better read at Christmas, but a modern day tale of foregoing the rat-race of the holidays blooms. 3 out of 5
0446677450|4.0|This book inspires me to think about my future and encourages me to take action to get out of the &quot;Rat Race&quot;. I think the key point in this book is &quot;let money works for us!&quot; The author uses 6 chapters to teach us how we can do that.This book tells me a different view about money and I understand money better now. I am totally agree with the author that &quot; work hard in school and get a good and stable job&quot; doesn't really work today.There are many people who are well educated but still they are struggling with MONEY! They are working for money all their life. I still believe that what we learn today in school is very important for us, however, I think it is also important for us to understand how money works. We should know how Rich get rich. I don't want to work for money all my life and live in the &quot;Rat Race&quot;.
B00004RE7C|4.0|What could be cooler than to [take over] the Enterprise? STIII is a shocker in many ways. Its character charisma retains well and bands them into (of all things) outlaws in cohoots with the Vulcan Ambassador, Sarek. The movie plays on the feelings left over from the end of STII and creates a gut-wrenching, tight story. III provides, ST fans with new toys...the Klingon Bird of Prey, science vessels, and the \\"great experiment\\" USS Excelsior (a far superior ship than the refitted Enterprise). Although, the Excelsior is not immune from Mr. Scott's handiwork, it's still a nice visual site (as is the interior of Spacedock). The crew goes on a forbidden mission back to Genesis, steals the Enterprise, and duels with the Bird of Prey. These luxuries combine to a few sad moments, a goodbye to a ST mainstay, and the spiritual ending that leaves you wanting for more and anticipating ST: IV. I left one star off because it does have a few boring moments...about 7 minutes worth. The adventure begins, again...
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Jake Gyllenhaal is unbelievable! Let's hope he stays versatile. This movie takes you where few movies dare to go. I can't give away plot details, but it's very stylized, eerie, menacing and surprisingly complex. Oh, and there is a giant talking bunny. The use of 80s music is excellent. Don't let yourself miss this one becasue it never played in theatres near you.
6305910103|5.0|Star Trek II, III, IV are the strongest in the series of original cast movies. VI is a finely done ending, but these three \\"treks\\" support each other. Since the day of Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\", there hasn't been a classic, simple, and enganging story of revenge and hatred. Nick Meyer's directorial takeover from Robert Wise (ST:TMP), was a good choice since Meyer likes to lay back on his classic-story roots. He portrays the characters, for the first time, as human...not forever youthful heroes. The Kirk-Khan rivalry take the vengeance scenario to new heights as past and present come together. ST II is about the acceptance of loss, the past that comes full circle, and the bystanding people who get caught in the middle. The Wrath of Khan remains, by far, the best in the series...and a chilling awakening of a realistic storyline. It may be sci-fi, but you can be assured the tale hits home...
B00005RHGK|2.0|I bought this movie thinking that it might be good. Boy was I wrong. I was amazed that every turn the characters would do exactly what I thought they would and in such a stupid fashion it wasn't even funny. That is the problem with new horror movies. They have absolutely no plot and no fun or spunk to them. What happened to the good ole classic 80's horror movie that was cheesy and dumb but smart? And you knew that it was going to be cheesy and dumb, but it was cool and smart anyway. I think that the movie industry needs to rethink their whole attitude toward these new movies that they are making. NO ONE LIKES THE FORMAT!! The sooner that movie producers figure this out the better. I gave it two stars one because I couldn't give it any less, and one because the special effects were fair.
0140186409|5.0|As I read these reviews, I came upon two that disregarded the finest book of all time as &quot;boring&quot;, and &quot;without a point&quot;.  I was saddened to realize that the crucial message so eloquently produced by John Steinbecks' fine pen, was lost on so-called &quot;AP&quot; students. (For starters, &quot;real&quot; AP students would have developed more profound literacy arguments than those stated.)  I was first exposed to this jewel of literature as a freshman AP student in high school.  As a senior in college now, the depth of this story only grows with each reading. Perhaps most disheartening in the disdain of these readers, is the ignorance to the storys' ending, the very crux of Steinbecks' message.<br />  Despite the grevious hardships endured at the hands of her fellow human beings and the stunning death of her infant, Rose of Sharon offers her breast to a dying man without hesitation.  This clarifies Steinbecks' hope; not just for the dying man or the Joad family, but for humanity itself.  A poignant symbol such as this is obviously lost on a few young reviewers, but valued by others.  My suggestion for the young readers who so obviously do not understand or appreciate this moving piece of literature is to start out with something more at their pace; Hardy Boys perhaps?
B000003NA3|5.0|I got this from the public library and i was surprised.  Each song is repeated at least twice but each new version is distinct in speed, instrumentation, and solos. <br />I really like Eric Dolphy's bass clarinet on my favorite tracks: INDIA, NAIMA and SPIRITUAL. The drone is smooth and relaxing and his yelping crying screaming solos are full of lyrical emotion.<br />Elvin Jones' drumming is raw and funky almost like rock but he is constantly swinging either with smooth brushes or cement mixer sticks.<br />I cant believe McCoy Tyner's solos! he flies but still manages to play the right notes at blistering speed and with subilty.<br />With these excellent sidemen Coltrane himself is taken to new heights of unrelenting drive in his playing that wouldnt be captured on record for 3 more years with A LOVE SUPREME.<br />It took me awhile to get ahold of these 4 discs and i didnt really see why a 4 disc set of live recordings was so good especially with the same 5 songs or so.<BR>IT IS WORTH HEARING! A LOVE SUPREME sounds sterile after hearing this but its still structured somewhat not like his later stuff.
0618129111|5.0|1) Gollum (Smeagle) is the epitome of the lowest creation. From the beginning when he murdered his best friend for the ring Gollum was doomed. He had the ring, but it possessed him. However, he lost the ring and even though it pained him he still loved and longed for it. It was his own, his precious. Gollum disappears, but then returns during the fellowship. After guiding Frodo and Sam he betrayed them in an effort to seize the ring. In the Return of the King he reappears and shadows Frodo and Sam. He plays an integral role in the completion of the task of the fellowship in Tolkien's ironic way.<BR>2) The unconventional way of wizards is an example of Tolkien's creativity. Most wizards have a wand, but Tolkien's wizards, though they are mystifying, seem to be the caretakers and historians of the world and are concerned for the greater well being of the earth and its inhabitants. They also seem to gain power from knowledge. When Gandalf returned as Gandalf the White he speaks of learning much and he has also increased in power. However, wizards are susceptible to the temptation of evil because a dark wizard is more powerful.<BR>3) The main object of the epic is the ring. The ring is inanimate yet it can turn anyone who possesses it towards evil even if they wish otherwise. It also could turn those who put it on invisible. The rings main purpose is to return to its master (Sauron). When it was created Sauron put part of him in it, in order to make him more powerful. It was also part of a masterful plan to force every creature under his power.<BR>4) Tolkien's depiction of the evil Sauron as a lidless eye that sees all is interesting anthropomorphism because he possesses the attributes of most evil beings, but since he is unable to take physical form he is a mysterious unseen powerful ruler. The Eye of Sauron sees all yet its attention can be focused on an area, allowing things to slip.<BR>5) The Ents are a truly original Tolkien conception. They are trees that have been awakened. Though their major role is in the Two Towers they do appear in this novel. They live to be extremely old, and don't like to be hasty. They also can break stone easily.<BR>6) Though the title of the book concedes the knowledge of the king's (Aragorn) return, after this event the book unexpectedly continues. After all the hobbit's hardships, when they reach home they still have to deal with an unforeseen difficulty. Saramen, a character who was thought to be out of the book, resurfaces at the head of the conflict. In the chapter the \\"The Scouring of the Shire,\\" Tolkien twists the plot and creates a small climax as the four hobbits rebel against men.<BR>7) This book, as with the previous two novels, showcases Tolkien's conceptual world. He masterfully is able to take the reader into this world, as if the story was fact.  <BR>8) This verse opens the book.                                                                                         &quot;Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,<BR>Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,<BR>Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,<BR>One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne<BR>In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<BR>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,<BR>One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<BR>In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.&quot;                                                                          It sets the stage for the coming tale and leaves the reader waiting to uncover more<BR>9) A skilled linguist, Tolkien's elven language further contributes to the overall sense of reality.<BR>10) By focusing on minor characters, such as Merry and Pippin, Tolkien is able to keep the reader from predicting the next event.

B00000IL1K|5.0|I discovered the magic of Sarah Brightman from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Masterpiece Phantom of the Opera.  I found in her a voice much more pure and clear than that of your average soprano.  I began recently to explore her other albums, and I must say I'm very impressed.  Eden if a fantastic mix of pop and classical.  If you are a fan of sarah brightman, you must buy this album.
B00005MG2Y|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I've ever heard. If you like ANY of the Linkin Park songs, you will like the rest of this CD. I don't think there is one bad track on here.
B000001FA4|5.0|Actually, maybe &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; is their best work; can't decide really. Whatever the matter, that mid-1980s, early 1990s period marked U2's creative peak. &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot; is a great collection of songs, not just one of U2's best but one of the best CDs in my collection...
B00005QAPH|5.0|This is an amazing film that hits you aesthetically and viscerally. The opening dream sequence is about the truest expression of a male in his forties that I could imagine and Mastroianni as the exhausted director Guido is the perfect blending of anxiety, detachment and ennui that follows the creative mind caught between projects.<br />A wonderful film. If you don't want to own it, rent it. You will not be disappointed.
B00005AUBA|5.0|I had always avoided the cutely-monikered Mogwai because of their reputation as uncompromising noiseniks.  I don't know about their previous work, but listening to this short album provoked a slow, creeping, hesitant but eventually wholehearted experience of pleasure, love and the kind of nostalgia for a non-existent past emotional life Wilde said was the peculiar power of music.  '2 Rights Make 1 Wrong' is only the most ambitiously beautiful of eight very beautiful songs: it is also exemplary, its base, long looping Television-style guitar melody, framed by phosphoric female backing vocals, is overlaid by instruments such as the banjo, trumbone, hammond organ or accordian, accumulaitng in a kind of restrained wake, half ritual dirge, half Pogues-style knees-up.  'Sine Wave' sounds exactly like movement through a musical graph, its curving deviations unutterably moving; 'Dial:Revenge', sung by Super Furry Animals' Gruff Rhys, is a ballad of spiked lugubriousness.

0140288503|5.0|This is one of the most accurate and gut-wrenching accounts of modern warfare available to those who do not have a Top Secret clearance. The access that the author was provided to the combatants and civilians involved appears to be largely unprecedented. And he has taken great pains to check and double-check the accounts he was given to present a truly objective account of the action. This is journalism of the highest order. Not for the faint of heart, however.
0375507507|5.0|I just finished reading this book and found I had a hard time putting it down. I was fascinated with this story of a life in Africa, growing up in a land that to me seemed so harsh, scary and uncomforatble, and yet so loved by the author and her family. I couldn't imagine living like that, the way her family lived, and I was astounded through the whole book and mesmerised by her matter-of-fact tone when she described different instances.<BR>I did find I had to keep myself from judging the author and her family because of their views on the people in their homeland, and I kept reminding myself that their life is so far removed from my life and anything I understand. I think that is what made it so interesting, so engaging.<BR>I can say, the only thing I wish the author had done was explain why her parents chose to live there, what made them tick, but again, that is putting my judgement on their family, which I am still struggling with. I also am interested in how the author finds living in the states, what life is like for her now. Of course, I have these questions because I became so wrapped up in the author's story, I wasn't ready for it to be over. I wanted to know more about this fascinating woman, and how growing up in this way affected the way she lives now. Exellent read.
B00005KHL5|5.0|&quot;The Wicker Man&quot; is proof that movies were more daring and provocative in the early 1970's than they are today.  This phenomenon certainly had much to do with the fall of the production code in the late 60's, and the rise of young filmmakers such as Cassavettes, Polanski, and Friedkin, as well as Schaeffer.  This film is sort of a macabre variation on &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; with the protagonist venturing into a world of seeming tranquility and peace as only the pagans could create.  However, under it all is a dark, sinister force at work, which is made all the more disturbing by the bouyant and frivolous manner in which the community lives.  In fact, the viewer will never look at the festival of the May pole in quite the same way again.  This film is a real treat and should be watched again and again for the complexity of its simplicity in setting and performances.
B00005K3OT|1.0|I have yet to see a less horrible movie since I saw this one. The symbolism is not so much thinly disguised as it is like getting hit with a freight train. It is one pretentious load of garbage that attempts to disguise just how bad it is by being a period piece set in France. Avoid at all costs.
6305907145|5.0|I am in the process of reading the book after seeing the movie and I can honestly say I loved this movie.  It's in the same spirit as Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility.  Although it maynot be true to the exact storyline, it definitely a wonderful movie to add to your collection if you like period pieces and well-defined characters.
0060273224|5.0|When Sabriel (age 19)gets a message from her father saying he is trapped in death, Sabriel must go on a long dangerous journey to rescue him before it is too late. Along the way she must fight many mysterious dead creatures with the help of her two companions, Mogget a very strange talking cat, and Touchstone a charter mage about Sabriel's age. This book is exciting, adventurous, and full of surprises. I recomend this book to anyone who likes fantasy books, or anyone who just likes to read.
B00005MP58|5.0|If you like romance and witty conversation... this is great DVD to snuggle up with for a few hours.  Buy it, you won't regret it!
B00005R2M3|3.0|We happened to catch Shakira's 'Whenever, Wherever' music video for the first time on Much Music this afternoon, and were very pleasantly surprised by her exiting voice and Latin influances (not to mention the lively visuals on the video).  <br />I can only offer the above rating as a rough '3' stars, since we only heard that one song from her latest album.  I doubt her ratings will go anywhere but up as her music becomes more popular in Canada.  Way to go Shakira!  Her latest album is a definite 'buy' for our family.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I am a recent fan and it's because of this CD.  Just Like a Pill and Misery are fantastic.  I highly recommend this CD.  I love it!
B00004XMV6|5.0|As an avid reader of erotic literature, it's certainly understandable that most erotic books could hardly be put on film without the cast and producers being immediately and summarily jailed by the powers to be. <br />However, this DVD of top notch entertainers, both in front and behind the cameras, have managed to develop those super elements of eroticism, of pursuit, capture, and ultimate submission of the mind and body that give spice to the sex and sin of it. <br />Zalaman King, as one of the team that produced and wrote the screenplay, and soundtracks by Grace Jones, Eurythmics, and Joe Cocker, not to mention the wonderfull acting skills of Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke (don't let preconceived notions of Mickey cloud your judgement in this DVD)makes this DVD a star packed sensation cut by masters. <br />It follws that the technical production of this DVD is blue blood quality and of course it's widescreen, dolby digital etc etc  ... nuff said ... <br />In the story our hero(Mickey,) meets and then seduces, Elizabeth(Kim B,) and then leads her on a wild and woderfull erotic journey of the heart, mind and the body. Elizabeth does not understand this and has trouble with this magical mystery tour since she has never met a wealthy, gentle, caring man who is a master of all flavours of erotic delights, and, he has the patience to court, woo and gently seduce our heroine .... (BTW it's true those men don't exist, so, if you want reality, stop reading here and forget this DVD ... LOL ) ...... <br />The erotic seductions scenes are skillfully done, and, the scene on the kitchen floor where Rourke feeds Bassinger a luscious assortment of foods is probably the best food erotic scene ever filmed. Trust me, there aren't many of todays actress stars that would allow the camera to get in that close to their faces as Bassinger did while literally gobbling up those dleights that she should get an academy award for that performance .... <br />Finally, I would venture to guessthat most men would not enjoy this movie, (they wouldn't have the patience and besides that's why they invented porn)  but, I can assure you, that if you are a woman and reads romance novels you'll, love it, and, here's the best part, if you are a woman that enjoys erotic literature, well then RUN and I mean RUN and buy this DVD cause like I said, hands down, (or whatever) it's fabulous and you won't love this DVD you'll gobble it all up ......
0789423952|3.0|This is overall a good book, with some interesting knots and useful illustrations. At times, however--more frequently than is acceptable--I have found the instructions a little too telegraphic and the illustrations completely mysterious. For instance, the illustrations sometimes seem to change orientation from one step to the next with no word of warning. At other times, critical parts of the knot are obscured by a hand of the person holding it. The descriptions sometimes give me the feeling that small but crucial operations have been left out, as if they belonged to the author's unconscious &quot;muscle memory&quot; and he never thought to include them. For example, it seems to me that it is topologically imposible ;-) to produce the Turqouise Turtle (pg. 52) following the the instructions and illustrations. You just can't get from step 3 to 4 without some missing manipulation of the rope.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I allready bought the soundtrack before I saw the movie. It only made me more curious for the movie. And what a movie it is! Go see it if you haven't seen it yet!<br />This score is full of pulsating choirs, dark string sections and sweet celtic music. I am very happy that the producers of the soundtrack decided to use the two most ethereal voices in popmusic, namely Enya and Elizabeth Fraser. Enya is featured on The Council Of Elrond and the end titles song May It Be. They are both gorgeous and fit perfectly in the movie, esspecially when two players in the movie share a romantic moment. It gave me goosebumps. Elizabeth Fraser is featured in the Song Lothlorien and with her shimmering voice, she sings a sad song for Gandalf. Please check out the Cocteau Twins, (the band where she's from) if you like ethereal popmusic, they are for you! This is a pumping and dramatic score, and it fits perfectly by the movie and the legend that is Lord Of The Rings.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This is a great CD. You listen to it once, and its addictive. Shes got a great voice, and talent. If you buy this CD, you wont be sorry. I cant wait for her next CD if there is one.
B00004TLMC|1.0|I heard all the hype about this movie, how great the acting was, etc., so I had the opportunity to watch it on HBO.  What a disappointment!  My view of Tom Cruise has really changed after watching it.  Rated R?  More like NC-17.  The movie left little to the imagination and I found it difficult to follow.  Was there really a storyline, or was it a show-all video?  It goes to show where people's mindset are these days.
B00003CX7L|5.0|I think that Toy Story 2 is actually better than Toy Story 1. I found it more exciting because of the new characters and the new storyline. Also the setting was expanded. There is the Al's Toy Barn, run by the greedy Al who collects toys like Woody!<br />There is an awesome scene where the toys drive the cars! The toys are rendered beautifully. Obviously, tons of work is put into such a production. Kudos to Pixar.
B000002UVZ|5.0|At first, this album seems a bit more straight rock than REM's earlier releases.  &quot;Begin the Begin&quot; starts the record off strong, and doesn't let up at all in the second track.  One of my favorite parts of the album is Mike Mills' great background vocals on &quot;Fall On Me&quot;.  <br />Another first on this album is the track &quot;Superman&quot;.  I believe it is the first time REM put a cover song on an album, and it is Mike Mills' first track as lead singer.  <br />All in all, another great release from REM, although a bit more straightforward at the beginning.
B00003CXN3|5.0|Traffic is one of those movies that you've definately got to have time to sit down, concentrate and really follow the plot. There are a number of different story lines that all start leading off at the same time, but they are all really related to the same main theme, which is the drugs trade in North America. The movie is not just based in the US, but nearly half of it is also set in Mexico, and so this part is all in Spanish language with English subtitles. It deals with many different aspects of the drugs trade, such as those who are dealing drugs (eg drugs cartels in Mexico and the dealers in the US), those who are using drugs (youngsters in the US) and those who are trying to clamp down on the drugs dealers(on both sides of the US-Mexico border). The movie also doesn't just give you one view of what the drugs trade is all about, as it deals with a number of different aspects and lets the viewer decide what to think. I think this is a great movie because there aren't any big punch lines and not everything works out in the end, and in reality that's the way the world is. Sometimes the 'bad guys' do get their way. There is a great cast of actors for this movie, and I think that Michael Douglas is brilliant in his role. Steven Soderbergh is a top director and I'll definately look out for his films in the future.
B00005R87Q|2.0|While this movie has a few high speed scenes and a great sound effects, the movie's week plot is worsened by cheesy &quot;I'm gonna kick your ass,&quot; teen talk.  A semi-surprising plot twist leaves the viewer hoping for more.  In the end, you've got a movie aimed at teen guys who still love cars covered in fancy crome and racing stips.  Maybe it's worth a rental on a rainy day, but save your cash if you plan to own it.
B00005JKQX|5.0|I must live in a cave, because I managed to see this movie without knowing too much about it in advance - a strategy I highly recommend to anyone not already familiar with the plot.  <br />There are a few things I can tell you that won't give anything away.  This is the first time I've ever understood the attraction of Russell Crowe.  It's not his looks, it's that he's smart sexy - amply on display through the movie.  His performance is consistently spectacular, from the big moments to the small ones.  Jennifer Connelly gives a wonderfully balanced performance as his loyal wife.  Not too sappy, not too rigid.  Director Ron Howard has done a great job of taking the outline of Nash's story and turning into a compelling movie.    <br />Stop reading right now and go see the movie.
B00005QZWI|3.0|I will refrain from reviewing the movie and the score itself, as no doubt some have done, and leave that to the appropriate venue.<br />As for this soundtrack CD, I thought it was at least adequate.  In fact, it was probably a more than adequate presentation of all of the score themes heard in the movie.  <br />Unfortunately, first impressions are the strongest, and my first impression was a bit disappointing, because although the rest of the score is fairly represented, I felt that the opening theme was somehow not properly represented on this album.<br />The first impression one gets as the movie opens is the voice of Galadriel uttering her prophecy, and then the somber music opening up.  Unfortunately, this part, the part which set the mood and gave me the strongest first impression of the movie; this was missing from this CD, and that was the part that should have been left in as part of the soundtrack, thereby creating the strongest first impression for the listener.<br />It also seemed to me that the music that is presented here in \\"The Prophecy\\" is somehow a bit different from the actual opening theme.  Is it? Perhaps I am mistaken.  Am I also mistaken in thinking that some of the other sections are close renditions of the original, and not actually the original?<br />By the way, for the benefit of the reviewer \\"Garland\\" in San Francisco, I also thought at first that the CD would not play on my PC.  However, I then remembered that combo CD's which include other content besides music, are will not always play automatically by putting it in the CD drive as normal music CD's do.  Instead mine went to a website link.<br />But...just open the Windows Media Player, go to CD Audio and it will be there.  Just click the play button.
B00003CXXS|4.0|Jurassic park 3 is an awesome action packed thrill ride. Reuniting us with Dr Alan Grant (Sam Neil) from the first film, this third installment takes us back to Site B - Isla Sorna where a divorced couple set out to rescue their young son who has been lost on the island after a parasailing trip went wrong.<BR>This film is helmed by Joe Johnston (Jumunji, October Sky) who although is no Spielberg, manages to deliver some incredible action and suspence sequences. The Dvd has three screens of special features including theatrical trailers for all three films, audio commentary by the special effects team and lots of behind the scenes footage. The picture is very sharp and the Dolby Digital sountrack is earth-shattering. With lots of brand new dinosaurs including flying Pteranadons and the giant Spinosauras, mind blowing special effects and a decent story to hold it all together Jurassic Park 3 should blow you out of your seat and is a must for the DVD collector.
0449227421|4.0|I found this a nice book to read. It is an interesting concept that  kept me reading and even guessing to the end.
0452282152|4.0|Girl with a Pearl Earring is an engaging portrayal of how the author imagined the famous Vermeer painting came to life.  I enjoyed especially the author's abundant use of imagery.  Chevalier creates a word picture herself with so many colors, similes, and metaphors.  <BR>Some other strong points I appreciated are the insights of the protagonist Griet.  She is very observant as well as sensitive, even though she realizes she is trapped in a world not of her choosing.  How she manages to survive and build another life for herself is touching because she has to overcome personal loss, the jealous Cornelia, intimidating Maria Thins, pouting Tanneke, and tempestuous Catharina, not to mention the sensitive yet insensitive Vermeer himself.  <BR>Griet is presented as a very strong young girl who is able to hold her own among some ineffective and weak people.  This aloneness of Griet's is what also drew me to the story.  <BR>That said, I must admit I prefer Girl in Hyacinth Blue, which also centers on Vermeer's art.  Its more intriguing presentation won me over, once I figured out what was going on.  Chevalier and Vreeland have very creatively re-presented a master to us in this new century of continuing crass commercialism and shallow efforts.
0060987464|5.0|Ive never been a fan of Marilyn Manson until recently. I saw his book...and after skimming through the pages, decided to read it. I know the media portrays him as a satan worshipper, reason for Columbine, etc. I, myself, didn't understand him but after reading this book find him very humane,funny,gross, and attractive at times. This is a good read for anybody...even the right handed Christian.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This film makes up for its mediocrity with it's extensive DVD package which is comprised of the best ever behind-the-scenes documentary, 7 completed deleted scenes and a whole host of other goodies.  THe only down fall of this DVD is a poor video transfer (it appears blurry at times) and an audio track that is almost &quot;too dynamic.&quot;<br />Don't buy this DVD necessarily for the movie, get it for the extras.
B000002N2Z|4.0|ok first off let me just say i bought this cd in the bargain rack and at first i didnt like it all but then it started to grow on me. the only problem with this album is the constant cussing for no reason on almost every song (yes i know its suppose to show anger but MAN). This cd doesnt have a sticker on it and i cant believe it doesnt because it is horrible lyrics. but i gotta say the music is very powerful and talented. i'm just saying this because i just cant believe it doesnt have a sticker on it and it should!
B000002MQ9|5.0|Personally i think  this is the best DCD cd' , it is enriched of the  finest Melodies  blended with Deep Classical instruments &amp; Defined into a Dark Romantic voyage,  creating Harmonies full of obscure and intense Beauty.
B00005RYKV|5.0|A Japanese yakuza henchman (played by Kitano) named &quot;Brother&quot; came the States after his clan was destroyed in a mafia war back in Japan.  Here the Brother organised his friends into a clan and started a cruel war on local mafia families to win a space.  The newcomer is cruel and does not think twice before killing his rivals.  However, what makes this movie worth watching is natural looking Darwinist style violence and relationships within his band beautifully played by Kitano and his actors.<br />What always appealed me in Kitano's films is human interaction between central characters including the most negative ones.  The Brother is cruel, strong, and a good marksman.  He is not a kind of person you ordinarily would like to meet on a street.  However, he ultimately sacrifices his life to save Danny, his black companion, from the band of Italians.  But in the beginning of the movie those two characters had very few if any reasons to like each other after the Brother pokes Danny in the eye with a broken bottle, then cheats him in a game.<br />Another moving scene is when the Brother's right hand man sacrifices his life to persuade another local Japanese criminal ring to merge with the Brother's operation.  Simple, convincing and incomprehensible at the same time!  <br />I gave this movie five stars and highly recommend it to anyone interested in action.  This film is The Action itself!
B00003CX9S|5.0|&quot;The Elephant Man&quot; is arguably the best of David Lynch's works while some may argue his best being &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, a film which may easily lock him up as a best Director nominee for the 2002 Academy Awards.  <br />&quot;The Elephant Man&quot; takes place in England about a man called John Merrick, who's used as a freak show because of his abnormal looks and body structure, played by John Hurt, who was given a new life by a doctor played by Anthony Hopkins.  The movie later takes us to see what Merrick goes through in his life before being rescued and the life after.    <br />It's important for many of you to note that this is a PG movie because this movie is that important for everyone to watch.  It demonstrates ignorance, prejudice, and the evils of the human race.  Watching this movie is a life-changing experience and perhaps a turning point in your life.  David Lynch's direction in this movie is absolutely outstanding right from the beginning to the end, strange and dreamy.  Lynch has long been criticized for his film to be a dreamy imagery by the film critics.  However, in this film, it works in its effect of telling the horrific cause of Merrick's looks and teaching us the main lessons of the movie.  It's evident there's so much passion put in to make this movie.<br />Bottom line, even though the movie could be disturbing at times, but it is compelling and beautifully made- in black and white.  If you want to see good acting and directing, this is the one.
B000002572|5.0|More Than A Feeling: Might be the greatest song on the CD, but who can tell?  By the time you buy this thing, you have heard this song a million times on classic rock stations.  The other songs will seem more new.<br />Peace Of Mind: The 2nd best song here.  The word &quot;compition&quot; never sounded so cruel, the phrase &quot;I Understand....&quot; never so comforting.  All with bombastic, sourround-sound.<br />Foreplay/ Taking My Time:  The worst song here.  The &quot;Foreplay&quot; section is imitation Pink Floyd, the &quot;Taking My Time&quot; section is hand-clapped hell with a retched solo.<br />Rock 'N Roll Music: An obvius Zeppline imitation, but it's authentic and innocent in it's worship.<br />Smokin: A more original version of the above song, but with unexpected (in a good or bad way I can't decide) boogie synth.<br />Hitchin A Ride:  Boston hijacks Zep's &quot;Going To California,&quot; but this song shimmers in it's own way.  GREAT guitar solo; sounds like proto-Def Leopard on Hysteria.  Also, great harmonies.<br />It Isn't Easy:  Four heart-stopping moments in one song: A) The ghostly opening, B) the visceral, zooming guitar notes immediatedly following the opening, C) Four words: &quot;GOTTA GOTTA HAVE YOU&quot;, D) The whiplash-inducing noise that immediately followed.  This song, the best on the CD, sounds the way that sex without a condom feels.  Throw in Everly Brother's-level harmony.<br />Let Me Take You Home Tonight:  Strange, more than anything.  Boston looses the advanced-calculas guitars.  Sounds like one-half Jimmy Buffet, one-half Marvin Gay.  To me, this is a formless, ungraspable song, but others may like it.  Just pretend it's not Boston, and everything will be just fine.<br />Overall, the CD displays a sound that still seems state-of-the-art.  The guitars are rightfully legendary, and make up for a few weak songs.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|The instrumentation is surreal, deep and moody, dazzling the listener inward into introspection. Lyrically \\"The Rainbow Children\\" is laced with undertones that emote a religious epiphany reminding us of Prince's deep rooted sprituality. Most of the content of the album is based on a common theme and remains consistant to a story Prince is trying to tell of a spiritual journey he has made, and is sharing with us this information. His revelations are indeed mysterious but always reveal an intriguing glimpse into Prince's world. Ironically though, as \\"Rainbow Children\\" is being hailed a \\"religious album\\", the recording is at times very demonic, right down to the painting of an evil impish and unhappy looking Prince on the actual Cd. I immensly enjoyed the tracks \\"Rainbow Children\\" , \\"Muse 2 The Pharoah\\", \\"Digital Garden\\", and \\"The Work\\". Prince gives us glimpses of some of the workmanship and originality of the \\"Sign O\\" The Times\\" and \\"Lovesexy\\" era, where he tended to be more experimental. A song like \\"Wedding Feast\\" which was presumably intended to be \\"brilliant\\" or \\"surrealistic\\", was in my oppinion an abrasive annoyance, a miscalculated backfire that disables the listener temporarily. With perky little numbers such as \\"She Loves Me 4 Me\\" (the only song close to a hit on here), \\"The Rainbow Children\\" has alot of ambition and has definately got to be listened to several times before you begin to appreciate it as a whole. Prince is far beyond the realm of trying to record pop hits, thankfully. He is at his creative best here spliting the world open like a ripe watermelon, finding his muse with an explosion of creativity at hand. \\"The Rainbow Children\\" was tagged \\"controversial\\" and I'm not quite sure what is so controversial about it, but it works on an artistic level that Prince hasn't displayed in the recent past. Could it be a movement? Are we experiencing Prince's \\"blue period\\" or is he stuck in the bell jar? Perhaps. \\"The Rainbow Children\\" leaves me feeling likea curious child on the balcony, puzzled yet wonderously intrigued.
B00005JKMO|3.0|The title of this review does not mean Ali is a brilliance amidst many other mediocre movies. It actually means one can find some brilliant moments in Ali the movie, but for most of the 2-and-half hour duration, it's boredom and incoherence.<br />I almost fell asleep the first 15 minutes into the movie. I don't think the boxing scenes are exciting, maybe except the last 2 mins of the last one (Ali Vs. Foreman in Zaire)... mostly due to the refreshing soundtrack accompanying that. And there're quite a few long and dragging boxing scenes. I was surprised that the style of shooting the boxing scenes in this movie is pretty similar to that in the Rocky movies (which were made about 20 years ago!). I had expected more artistic touches or maybe even more thrills in the boxings in Ali. But it's disappointing.<br />The movie is more like a collection of anecdotes in Ali's early career than a coherent story, not to mention a drama. As such, there is really not a point in the movie that can be called a climax. Without an interesting storyline, in order to keep the audience mentally involved in the movie, it at least has to offer some superb acting and effective atmosphere.<br />For the acting, it's one of the few brilliant spots of the movie. Will Smith is very good. On the screen, he's totally a people's champ and he portrays Ali's confidence (arrogance) and humor wonderfully. Besides Smith, I think the other cast members in general do a good job, too.<br />However, the second ingredient, the atmosphere, is less than satisfying. The decision to shoot some sequences using hand-held camera is a good one. It gives a more real and historical feel to this cinematic biography. And overall, I think each scene is OK (maybe except the one where thousands of supporters in Zaire are chanting Ali's name for... oh the whole 3 mins or so!). But on a larger scale, the arrangement of the scenes does not seem sharp enough. As I mentioned, too much time is given to too many boxing sequences.A few more scenes describing the mental journey of Ali before and after his decline to join the military would be welcome additions. And I would feel more comfortable if the long scene where Ali stares at his portrayals on his admirers' houses in Zaire is completely deleted (too corny and artificial). <br />The movie wants to give a big picture of Ali to the audience. But it's hard to do because the movie can be only 2 or 3 hours long. Unlike in many other biography flicks like \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" which revolves around only one or two extraordinary aspects of the character's life (and portrays it with some dramatization), Ali the boxer is presented in a matter-of-fact manner and many different aspects of his life are covered with equal weight. This style is not likely to work if the atmosphere is not really well crafted, which is unfortunately the case here. To me, not a fan of Ali's, he's just another person with some character and some achievement. I'd thought this movie would change my perception somewhat. But even during or after the movie, I really don't feel as though I care much for him. I suppose I would not prefer this movie to a PBS documentary of Ali (if there's one).
0385505833|1.0|Reading Skipping Christmas is like waiting for a really bad joke teller to stumble through to the punch line when you already know what the punch line is.  The book is filled with flat characters, moronic dialog and a plot so painfully obvious it would have a tough time passing muster for a sitcom.  Don't waste your time.
068485743X|1.0|The First Five Pages does give some insight into how quickly agents and editors will toss a manuscript. It was much more about clear writing than anything else, though, and if the author is right about how little time editors spend looking at the text, good writing wouldn't help either. She cites an example of a man who submitted a Pulitzer-prize winning book in manuscript form--every publisher rejected it. So, editing according to her guidelines will do little to get you published.<br />Incredibly, the author makes no mention of queries or proposal letters; only complete manuscripts. As I understand it, agents and editors almost never accept manuscripts before proposals, so regardless of how good your manuscript is, it will be tossed before it's even looked at. This is a bizarre oversight from someone who is supposedly an industry insider.<br />The emphasis on tight writing is appropriate, but there are other books that succeed here where The First Five Pages fails: Joseph M. Williams \\"Style: Toward Clarity and Grace,\\" which is the best book I've ever seen on the subject.<br />In short, \\"The First Five Pages\\" doesn't seem like the kind of book that should have made it past the editors.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This was the first movie I ever owned on DVD I liked it so much.   No matter how many times I watch it I sitll get chills, and I still hang on every word.   The animation is clean, beautiful.  The way the humans  and animals move is quite subtle but when you pay attention to it, the level of work and thought is amazing.  <br />The  story is chocked full of mysticisim, and is set in an age when man and beast lived side by side, and thier tolerance of each other is growing weaker and weaker day by day.<br />The most amazing thing about the story is the complexity of all the characters. not a single one could be placed into a stereotype, Goodguy, badguy, clown... whatever... They all have a degree of complexity to them that can make a viewer love and hate them at the same time...  All the characters have a goal, even if it means going against each other, but each of them have very valid reasons and are not evil for what they seek. <br />Oh yea, A great score too, the orchestration really accentuates the plot and amplifies the characters emotions without being too distracting, which is a nice change.
B00005QHSN|5.0|I ordered this CD cause I'm in the states and it hasn't been released over here.  It was well worth the money.  This CD is nothing short of amazingly awesome.  There is so much soul and funk that I was actually applauding while listening to it in my car.  I've been a fan since Symphony and if you liked his older stuff you will love this.  Just incredible.  I hope that one day, I'll get to see a live performance.  Until then, I'm just happy that he has released a new CD after 6 years.  Incredible talent, songwriter, musician, and overall performer.  Terence Sananda is DA MAN!!!  Welcome back.

B00004Z459|5.0|I honestly wasn't sure about how good this cd would be when I got this album from my girlfriend...let me just say it is amazing and well-worth your money! This is honestly one of the very few albums that one doesn't have to flip through looking for good songs - every single song on here is amazing! True, this music may seem a little bit heavy for some people, but I honestly can say that I like almost all music and this ranks high on my list! I say go for it and buy this CD because its so amazing! If your not sure, then preview some of the songs to see how &quot;heavy&quot; they are...although personally I don't think they are all that much, but hey, thats juz my opinion.
0446677450|1.0|The main point this book makes is to buy assets not liabilities.<BR>An asset is defined as something that puts money in your pocket, a liability takes it away.  The way this guy is really making money is with all his best selling books (with spelling errors).  I would recommend multiple streams of income by Robert Allen, at least he admitted to making millions off a book.  If you're clueless about money and in debt, maybe this book will convince you to not be stupid with money.  A lot of people are bad with money, that is the reason for the great reviews.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This movie is not alone a sci-fi-Adventure movie, it's a whole Pinocchio inspired universe in the near future, words cannot describe this movie, you have to watch it, if you're a big Spielberg fan!<BR>Elder school kids will love this entertaining and educating movie about our society, and the world, that could end like this movie.
0871137380|5.0|I served 12 years in the Air Force as a Combat Controller (AF Special Forces) and was last assigned to the 23rd Special Tactics Squadrons at Hurlburt Field in Florida.  Are motto, \\"First There, Last Out\\", pretty much sums up what we did.  I have never read a book that more accurately captures the sentiment that a soldier never leaves a man (generic for person) behind...NEVER.  It cost the Army 15 additional men, good men, attempting to save the soldiers in the bird that fell that day, but it was worth it.  After all, try getting soldiers to fight for their country if they don't believe that their country will risk this much to save them if indeed they fall in combat.   Although it has been said many times that we fight for God and country, those of us who have been in combat know that it is God and country that motivate us into battle but it is the man next to us that keeps us there, and keeps us going back in...until no one is left behind.  It is for them that these brave soldiers fought and died, not for ideology or a blind sense of duty.  <br />What had been portrayed as a series of screw-ups in the media was in actuality nothing of the sort.  This book eloquently demonstrates that these soldiers accomplished every bit of their intended mission that day.  The only screw-up occurred long before that day, when President Clinton, not unlike President Reagan before him, put our soldiers in harm's way without adequate support and with an untenable mission.  This story shows that we can no longer afford to put our people in the middle of a target-rich environment and then shackle them to a rule of engagement that says only shoot when shot at.  If a battle is waging and there are people on the rooftops, for instance, you can bet they are not there for shelter...those people are by definition combatants.  One need not wait for them to take careful aim and pip off a surface-to-air rocket as they did here.  An A-130 gunship would have saved 19 lives that day.  It was in the futile attempt to spare innocent lives that these soldiers were sacrificed.  Some day the politicians will learn that the military is designed to kill people and break things, not to surgically extract dictators or to carefully glean the subtle nuances between combatant and &quot;casually-dressed woman pulling an AR-15 from a basket.&quot;  By the time you recognize her as a combatant, you've lost three men.<br />Based on a recommendation, I recently read a book called Operation Pseudo Miranda and was mortified to see another example of politicians placing soldiers (in the war on drugs) in harms way without sufficient support or proper training.  Not unlike Black Hawk Down, most of them got dead for their troubles.  And not unlike Black Hawk Down, you feel as though you are there and are glad you are not.  Read both.
B00004ZD69|5.0|In a world full of Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys, along comes this! &quot;Orchestral&quot; doesn't even do it justice. Sometimes bleak and often powerful, this is an incredible effort. Truly worth the money, a feast for your ears!
B000002ADT|5.0|Not since bethovens ninth has music approached such perfection as this.  Transcendent in every sense from first to last note. Masterpiece seems understatement.
B00005B36H|5.0|This new Tool releases is probably among the top 10 albums of 2001. Lately, there are too many hard rock bands out there that sound so much alike that is difficult to tell one from the other. Tool has reinvented its self and by presenting this amazing album shows that hard rock can be a fertile ground for music innovation.  Lateralus sound production is also noteworthy as the instruments (specially the bass) shine all through the recording<br />But be aware this is no easy listening. Lateralus is a dense record with no &quot;hit singles&quot;. Its a concept record that evolves with time. For me Tool is lake the King Crimson of hard rock bringing new ideas with each record. No wonder they toured with KC last year.
0375703861|3.0|This is an interesting little book. The end is a bit of a let-down: you get the feeling the author could have gone on and on with these characters' lives, and so at some point she just had to say &quot;stop&quot; and her ending was simply the best way she could come up with to stop the action, dead in its tracks.<br />It is a page-turner. And frankly its entertainment value should not be minimized. But even though it has the opportunity to tackle some hugely explosive issues (inter-racial marriage, minority oppression, religious fundamentalism, racism, etc), these things are really glossed over. The characters remain amazingly flat.<br />This is light reading. Good. But very light.
B00001ZULV|4.0|Genesis is one of those bands that could never be properly represented in a greatest hits CD. The ground covered in progresive rock and even pop music is best represented in the two Archive boxed sets released before this compillation. <br />Turn it on Again: The Hits is based on the Phil Collins era of the band with only two songs from the Peter Gabriel time (I know what I like and the Carpet Crawlers). This of course will make serious Genesis fans discard this CD from the begining. Nevertheless, the song Carpet Crawlers has been recorded again by the most &quot;legendary&quot; Genesis line-up (Gabriel, Collins, Rutherford, Hacket and Banks). The truth is that this alone makes the CD a must buy. The new interpretation is perfect with both Gabriel and Collins taking turns on vocals and the end results is one of the most memorable Genesis moments ever. <br />As for the rest of the CD I must confess that I like it. Perhaps is ment to do just what the title suggests to turn again the old Genesis records and motivate us to dig deeper into the amazing musical legacy that this band has constructed over the years.
B00000099Y|5.0|Aenima is just simply a magnificent album with brilliant underlying themes.  One of the very best rock albums of the 90s only matched by pearl jam, ten. Maynards voice is exceptional in all forms of music from the hard rock stylings of Aenima and stinkfist to the more mellow songs brilliantly played on Aenima. Message to Harry Manback is an interesting view into Tools minds but is by no means the only guide to their views. Tool are one of the few bands that see an album as more than just a collection of songs as they show on Aenima they few the album as a complete piece of work and seperate tracks are only necessary for the publics ease of use. A must buy a great album.
B000000OS2|5.0|This is one of the best rock concerts I have ever heard. Tesla recorded this album when acoustic performances where not as popular as they are today. The record presents a hard rock band with no effects or stage extravaganzas but the music instead of loosing focus becomes more interesting and intense. Being a band from the late 80's (when glam rock was at its peak) this was a bold move at the time.<br />The set features both original and covers of Creedence, Beatles and Rolling Stones among others and putted Tesla in the spotlight as a powerful classic rock band. This record, in retrospective, was perhaps their most solid and sucessful.<br />The good thing about this album is that is still as interesting and true today as it was when it was recorded. Its one of those records that stands the test of time and gets better with age.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If you like musicals, songs you can sing along to, romantic stories, or stories that leave you with a smile and tear, you'll LOVE Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge!<br />Moulin Rouge is set in France in 1899. It's the tragic story of a spontaneous love affair between a young, idealist writer named Christian and a jaded showgirl named Satine. All goes well until the Moulin Rouge becomes dependent on an evil Duke, who just happens to wants Satine all for himself.<br />This is a love-it or hate-it kind of movie. With remakes of songs from artists like Elton John, the soundtrack is a truly dazzling entity in and of itself (BUY IT!!) However, with songs about every five minutes, it's hard for people with short attention spans to fully appreciate the little nuances in the songs and in Ewan's great smile. But if you're a showgirl at heart, or if you truly believe in Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and Love, you'll LOVE this movie!
B00005QY5Y|5.0|This is partly a review, and partly a &quot;thank you&quot; card to the other reviewers for talking me into buying this with your glowing recommendations.  I will add my own here.<BR>I think this is one of the best albums I have bought in a LONG time.  I fell in love with it so quickly, that later the same day I was back at the store to purchase &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;.  Part of the reason that I did fall in love with it so quickly was becuase it sounds so familiar.  Not in a bad way, as some have mentioned in thier complaints of the album.  Yes, Ryan Adams borrows heavily from 60's rock, but he also infuses his own brand of songwriting which helps keep it fresh.  While there have been many names dropped when comparing the album to artists of the past, I would say that the one he sounds like through the majority of the album is Van Morrison both vocally, and musically.  <BR>This is a very soulful rock album, driven by it's excellent choruses and thoughful verses.  You won't find another song like New York, New York on this album - as most of the album is more toned down than the fun, upbeat opener.  That isn't to say that the album is without other great uptempo tracks, because there are enough to keep the album flowing along.  After listening to &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, fans of Adams will notice that this is a nice change of pace from his debut.  While I do really enjoy &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, I found that it just had too many really slow blues numbers for my taste.  They tended to blend together by the end of that album.  He aparently learned from his debut, and keeps the pace fresh by changing it up from time to time on this one to help keep the listener on thier toes.  <BR>Is this a perfect album?  No.  I would prefer that he choose what voice he is going to sing in, and stick with it.  If I were to hear a few of these songs on the radio in a row, I might not have any idea that they are all the same artist.  Is that his way of keeping things fresh?  Is thathim just paying homage to the legends of the past?  I'm not sure, but I personally could have done without it.  That said, there isn't a track that you would want to skip on this album.  Put this on, and let it play!  And play, and play!<BR>Still, this is a major step forward from &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; - which is saying a lot, considering some of the strong tracks on that album.  I look forward to future albums, with the hope that he takes even further leaps.<BR>I highly recommend this album, as a gleam of excellence in the era of overindulgent punk/rap/teen-pop.
6302516919|3.0|This film does not do justice to the book. Many important details were changed and some left out all together. Carpenter abriged many elements of the story that made it scary, such as the nightmares, the car's strange smell, and the lights on the dashboard that seem to turn into eyes. The film manages to be entertaining, but lacks the suspense and emotional impact of the book.
B00005OMTT|4.0|It looks like the Enigma mani won't stop right now, nearly ten years after their first debut album, with the classic hit 'Sadeness Part I', and now they released a new single called 'Turn Around', and I hope it means a new album this year, or next year.<BR>I've been a Sandra fan since I was kid, and I didn't know Sandra was the female voice of Enigma, untill I loaned the first Enigma album in the library.<BR>The only backdraw on Enigma's albums, is the sampled chantings, Michal Cretu can chant by himself, it's heard on the start of 'Enigma 3'.
B00000AFWW|5.0|While I really enjoyed \\"Live Through This\\"...Holes' follow up \\"Celebrity Skin\\" is their finest release in terms of polish and refinement of sound.  It has more melodic and soft cuts, but these are not always the rule here.  Oddly, while the first 4 cuts are radio friendly and light, \\"Reasons To Be Beautiful\\" my second favorite cut on this CD, is the classic Hole we all know and LOVE.<br /><br />While Love is using her vocal talents in a softer way than ever before on the majority of the cuts,  when the CD transitions at the aforementioned cut #5, she reverts to the earlier singing style of \\"Live Through This.\\"  The next three cuts are unmemorable except for the lyrical content.  The soft pretty melodies return on \\"Boys On The Radio\\" cut #9, a great song.  I also like the closing cut \\"Petals\\" very much too.<br /><br />The title cut \\"Celebrity Skin\\" is definitely the shining star on this CD.  It is my favorite cut, and one of my favorite songs, period.  I love the lyrics that pretty much sum up Courtney's (w)hole Hollywood experience in a quite accurate and delightfully scathingly way.  Every single line is a gem, and the melody is catchy, chord pattern fantastic!  When you pop in the CD and the cut roars in with a quick riff and Courtney singing \\"Oh make me over...\\" you know you're in for a treat.<br /><br />Do I recommend you buy this CD?  YES!  My personal opinion is if you have no less than three, and preferably 4 or more cuts you really like, it's worth a place in your collection.  This CD has 8 winners in 12 cuts, a very generous helping of quality listening material.  Of course, you'll have to listen and judge for yourself.<br /><br />If you like Hole, this CD will NOT disappoint you.  Even if you enjoy the rougher grunge style of the bands previous releases, you will still find alot of things to Love about Courtney here.  I consider \\"Celebrity Skin\\"  a milestone and a must for any true Hole/Courtney Love devotee.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Billboard has certified the Beatles 1 album as the no. 1 album of 2001. So I don't know where Gregg Holycross from South Bend, IN is coming from. Billboard just certified this album 8x platinum. The Beatles 1 CD set a new world record by going no. 1 in over 34 countries. Gregg Holycross, you must be living in some sort of cave. The Beatles 1 is the top album of 2001. Ain't you heard the news?<br />The sound quality of this album is spectacular. This is without a doubt one of the greatest albums ever released, in any era. It is not only the top album of 2001, it is one of the all-time greatest albums ever released anywhere. Gregg Holycross makes comments that are rubbish. In stereo or mono, the Beatles sound great. This album was put together by the Beatles themselves, not EMI as Holycross erroneously states. The last time the Beatles released a greatest hits package was in 1982, the Beatles 20 album. So this album is a long time coming and fills a void in the Beatles discography. Holycross is a nowhere man, totally out of it.The sound quality is excellent. One of the channels on &quot;Day Tripper&quot; was restored and &quot;She Loves You&quot; was also restored. The songs never sounded better. This album will in time become the biggest album of all time. It is that good. This is the album to take on a desert island. These are the greatest songs of the greatest musical group in history all on a single CD. This album is not only the top album of 2001 but will become the greatest album of all time. Sorry to disappoint you Gregg. You are like that Decca executive in 1962, Dick Rowe, who turned down the Beatles and told them &quot;guitar groups are on the way out.&quot; Rowe later got a chance to eat his own words. You too must be munching on those words!
B00004Y62T|5.0|Here's a film that I watched upon wakening one early morning, and it is truly an eye opener in more ways than one.<br /><br />Matt Damon as the movie namesake, is sent to Italy by the father of a spoiled and wayward son,  Dickie (Jude Law) to bring him home.  Instead, Ripley becomes infatuated with Dickie upon their first meeting.  He charms with his uncanny imitations of Dickie's Dad,  mimickry being his talent.  He then insinuates himself and becomes part of a troika with Dickie and his fiance, played by Gwyneth Paltrow.  When the idolatry begins to pall, Ripley is rejected and trouble begins.<br /><br />Part of what makes this special, is the most incredible European flavor throughout the film, and the mood  it creates.  The gorgeous countryside locale shot in Italy with all the wonderful statues, fountains, marble, gardens ect...is a treat for the eyes.  This film also showcases the talented Mr. Matt Damon in an outstanding portrayal of a sociopath who has crossed the line and gone too far to ever come back.<br /><br />For a very interesting plot, a fine character study, and a video trip to beautiful Italy, you must see this film.  It's truly fascinating.
B00005UKE0|4.0|First I'll explain the suggestive header of my review. With all the hype, effort, and cost of reissuing this magnificent work, why oh why did the C.D.'s come in Dixie-cup paper quality sleeves.How impractical is this..you have to pinch the disc hard to get it out of the straightjacket sleeve!!<br />There is no need to glorify this effort...it stands on its own as a reminder that the best rock and roll is not necessarily loud and rebellious, but melodic and introspective. Current bands like Creed are often credited with making \\"religious overtone\\" palpable for rock fans...here's the evidence that George did it FIRST \\"all those years ago\\".<br />I was a kid when this project was originally released, and at that time I was limited to buying radio singles. The purchase of this disc introduced me to a goldmine of George tunes that I had never heard before...what a revelation! Along with the obvious hits, this masterpiece boasts gorgeous and haunting tunes such as \\"I'd have you anytime\\" and \\"Art of Dying\\". I also enjoy \\"Wah Wah\\" and \\"All Things Must Pass\\".<br />A number of the reviews knock the Phil Spector production on this C.D....I refuse to knock Phil Spector...time cannot diminish the value of his contributions to this project...\\"sound\\" is a matter of taste. Like any producer, Phil added his \\"flavor\\" to the recordings, and I enjoy the end result.<br />I called a friend who owns the 3 lp set, and borrowed it to do a sound comparison. The C.D is significantly better the l.p.. Re mastering cleaned up the recording without changing its shape too much. I am only too happy to sacrifice some of the muddy textures that dominate much of the record version. I give this disc set 4 stars because of the ... cd sleeves,short booklet, and \\"My Sweet Lord 2000\\"...ouch, that hurts! By the way, if you can find it, get a hold of Georges live c.d. from 1992 (\\"Live In Japan\\")...I was lucky enough to find it as a cutout, and its magic!<br />Thank You George ... your inner light shines forever!ver!

B00005RHGK|2.0|A potentially good movie, ruined by too many cliches, a bad script and the two dumbest kids in the whole of the United States. This movie could have been good - the plot idea was quite workable. However - enter the main stars of the film ... Did no-one ever tell them that it is bad for your health to stand and watch the evil guy who has spent the movie trying to kill you instead of simply driving away as fast as you can ? There are a few redeeming features to the movie - a creepy soundtrack and some good moments (though few and far between) - which save this from getting just one star ... The movie would have been better if it were another Scary Movie style spinoff, unfortunately it tries to take itself seriously.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This brilliantly choreographed, acted, and filmed movie tugs at my very emotions every time I watch it.  Not only is the movie beautiful in its portrayal of the Union and Confederate leaders, it is also historically accurate and objective in its story and setting.  The movie draws you into the intensity of the battle and leaves your heart pounding at the end of the film.  I especially enjoyed the portrayals of Richard Jordan as Lewis Armistead and Stephen Lange as General Pickett.  Although a lengthy film, its story commands your attention every moment.  I was also delighted with the music (Randy Edelman) and how well this beautiful soundtrack blended with the events in this great epic.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|but Rufus Wainwright deserves it. There is a haunting lyricism and a power to his words and his arrangements that stretches across genres, across cultures, across genders and orientations. The tongue-in-cheek &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot; and the trippy &quot;Tower of Learning&quot; are especial standouts, but every track is beautiful, whether it's just Rufus and his guitar (singing his father Loudon Wainwright III's &quot;One Man Guy&quot;) or a chorus of heavenly voices (on the futuristic &quot;Shadows,&quot; featuring a member of the Propellerheads). <BR>If you only buy one CD that came out in 2001, make this it. You will not regret it.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I can't say I hated EVERY minute of it.  I thought the podrace was exciting and well done -- I liked the underwater-with-giant-beasts sequence -- Queen Amidala's outfits were very cool -- I enjoyed the two-on-one lightsaber duel at the end.  The sprawling land battle scene between the droids and the Gunguns was very cool visually.  Ootah Gunga, the underwater city of the Gungans, was freaking gorgeous! as were almost all of the locales -- Theed (Naboo's capital city), the Jedi Council chambers, etc.)<br /> Things I disliked about Phantom Menace:<br /> 1.) Jar Jar Binks (though I didn't hate him as much as other people did) His voice/language were very grating.  The fact that Lucas felt it at all necessary to include something so goofball gets to me.<br /> 2.) I know for a fact that several members of the cast are incredible actors; I've seen them in other films.  Yet they are SOOO wooden in Ep. 1.  I have to assume it's Lucas's fault.  He's become so enamored with his super-advanced non-linear editing system where he can digitally combine Take 7 of Liam Neeson with Take 13 of Ewan McGregor.  So in love with the fact that he can just put his actors in front of a bluescreen.  I feel he is robbing any and all spontaneity from the performances of his actors.  There's no rhythm to their conversations.<br /> 3.) The boy playing Anakin (Jake Lloyd) was awful. But I can't help but wonder if he's victim to the problem noted above.<br /> 4.) What the @#$&amp; is up with the Star-Trek-scan-for-lifeforms-in-his-blood-sample explanation of The Force?!?!?  And the whole immaculate conception thing?  Was any of that baloney necessary?  I (and probably just about everyone else in the world) was perfectly content to have The Force be an ambiguous something that even a master like Yoda could only explain with poetry and vague-isms.  I didn't see Yoda greet Luke's arrival on Dagobah and request for training by whipping out a handy dandy Lil' Jedi's First Aid Kit.<br /> 5.) The dogfight against the droid ships/mother ship was a joke.  Not developed at all - no pacing, no one we cared about (except Anakin and that's debatable), no sense of what their objective was.  The best dogfight was in Star Wars. Excellently paced, different people taking their shot at the trench, the emotional resonance of Biggs's death, etc.  Even Return of the Jedi's dogfight had these elements, especially the sudden realization that the death Star was &quot;fully operational&quot; and then started blowing the big ships out of the &quot;sky&quot;, will the Falcon be destroyed, if they DO succeed in destroying DSII Luke is dead, etc.  I just didn't care about the Ep. 1 dogfight.<br /> Now don't get me wrong, I wouldn't have wanted to be in George Lucas's shoes by any stretch of the imagination.  Fan expectation was immeasurably high.  High to the point that I believe it would have been almost impossible to please them (us).  But, that said, I think that removed from the excitement of seeing a new Star Wars movie, after fiercely clinging to a hope and prayer that this movie would be worthy of the Star Wars legacy, that after the incredible eye candy that a legion of production artists, animators, digital montage specialists, costume designers, etc. has faded from your retina, you are left with a slow paced, poorly acted film populated by characters we barely care about which dismantles beloved aspects of the original trilogy.<br /> I still pop Ep. 1 into my DVD player from time to time but it is never to watch the movie.  I do it to watch one of the &quot;making of&quot; documentaries or to watch the podrace sequence or to freeze frame one of the gorgeous digital compositions.  That to me is a sad, sad fact.
B000007T1M|5.0|The self-titled debut from System Of A Down demonstrates what happens when you mix creativity with insanity and loud instruments. Its seems that the band is out to feed the fire within all who hear their music while intriguing with odd lyrics and a new sound. If thats what they came here to do, then they have succeeded two-fold.<br />Although they didn't really become a common name until they released the first single from their second album &quot;Toxicity&quot;, I thought they were incredible and that they represented some new and different in music. Mainly focused on screaming the first time around, singer Serj Tankian performs each song with fire and intensity and at times, toning it down while rambling wild lyrics (i.e. the verses of &quot;Sugar&quot;). The instruments are not as focused as their sophmore release which make the album even more wild. Daron Malakian's guitar is low and deep, giving a kick in the face with every power chord and sudden maniacal tangents he plays. As usual, bassist Shavo Odadjian and drummer John Dolmayan follow pursuit tightly and complete the full-on harsh sound of the album.<br />Most of these songs are the usual hard-hitting mosh-fest you'd find in &quot;nu-metal&quot; bands today, excluding &quot;Spiders&quot;. I can't really pinpoint the best tracks because each one grabs hold and doesn't let go until the final note. Give it a listen and discover your favorite tracks.<br />System Of A Down's debut album is a strong album, exhibiting the best music of today's metal scene. This album is a must for &quot;nu-metal&quot; fans and anyone who enjoys the madness of the second album. There is more to this album than &quot;Sugar&quot; and &quot;Spiders&quot; so check it out. Its definitely worth a listen.
0679745203|5.0|This, as my teacher told us, is a novel one must reread every five years or so.<BR>Not a quick or easy read, The English Patient one of those books written in language so distilled, so concentrated, that one phrase can be explicated for pages.  Its images, many of which I do not yet understand and many of which I'm sure I missed this time through, slip in and out of your consciousness long after you've finished the novel.  The effect is that of someone tugging gently on your sleeve and saying &quot;hey, pay attention -- this is important, this is what meaning is made of.&quot;  <BR>The story is that of 4 characters who have come to inhabit a bombed-out, ruined and abandoned Italian villa towards the end of world war 2.  With supreme skill as a storyteller, Ondaatje dips us into their pasts, so that we are made aware of their stories snapshot by snapshot; this is particularly true of the mysterious nameless faceless 'English patient', a severe burn victim with a deep, secretive history.  <BR>There is such power in this novel I'd like to bottle its spirit, its poetry and its beauty, and carry it with me.  This book is IMPORTANT to me.  I cannot say any more than that.
B000002KKS|5.0|For over a decade and through 8 albums, Ozzy Osbourne fronted one of the bands that basically pioneered the metal genre. In 1979, tensions within the band resulted in Ozzy's expulsion. In 1980, Black Sabbath returned; same sound, new singer.<br />That singer was powerhouse vocalist Ronnie James Dio. His vocals were in no way similar to Ozzy's but his ability and how he blends with the music did away with that fact. Before joining Black Sabbath, Dio had performed vocals for Elf and Raindow who, although different in their own ways from the Sabbath sound, had the same type of upbeat, rocking and, at times, trippy moments. Behind the new frontman's vocals were the three original men of Sabbath: guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Terence &quot;Geezer&quot; Butler and drummer Bill Ward. Iommi's guitarwork on this album is a lot less gloomy than earlier Sabbath releases but it is still very good and inspiring, my favorite guitar riffs being from &quot;Children Of The Sea&quot; and &quot;Wishing Well&quot;. The great Geezer Butler (one of the best bassists to come out of the 70s) once again does fantasic work, especially on the track &quot;Lady Evil&quot;. Ward's drumming is very solid and provides a nice rhythm and backdrop to the songs.<br />Much like the previous Black Sabbath albums, each song is wonderful with no filler tracks. Amongst the 8 tracks, the ones that stand out the most to me are &quot;Children Of The Seas&quot;, &quot;Lady Evil&quot;, &quot;Heaven And Hell&quot;, and &quot;Wishing Well&quot;.<br />I realize that absence of Ozzy from this album turns fans off but I think they should give the album a chance and take a listen. You may be surprised. Fans of Raindow and Dio's solo work may approve of this album as well.
6304711905|5.0|This is one of my favorite versions of the Wyatt Earp story.  Kurt Russell is great as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer steals the show as Doc Holliday.  Powers Boothe plays Curly Bill (as an Western version of an organized crime boss) and Michael Biehn acts as Curly Bill's henchman Ringo, who is very quick on the draw. <BR> <BR>One of the aspects I liked about the movie was the emphasis on the strong bond of friendship between Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday.  The movie also seems to portray the feud between the Earps and the Clantons as two rival &quot;gangs.&quot;  <br />Another aspect of the movie that I found interesting is that the movie portrays Earp as somewhat of a self-centered entrepreneur who was unwilling to act as a marshall until he was forced to by his brothers. <br />I liked the pacing of the movie.  It was not long and drawn out like &quot;Wyatt Earp.&quot;  The action sequences are great (e.g. The Gunfight at OK Corral is exciting and more authentic then the other portrayals in other movie versions).<br />I give this movie a two thumbs up.

B00003W8NM|5.0|Not only is the adaptation to film brilliant, but the added scenes and ideas seem as though they were meant to be in the original novel.  Chuck P's statement about consumerism is violently real while the underlying story deals with the proletariatization of the middle class and how our struggles within ourselves can lead to external violence and rage.  The DVD has some awesome features, like a hilarious catalogue filled with all kinds of crazy things (like a shirt that comes in the color &quot;bunny&quot;) if you have the time and eye sight to read through it.  There are also T.V spots, trailors, commentaries, and various other fun stuff.  Read the book, buy the DVD, be enlightened.
B00005JKOV|5.0|This movie is really an idea movie that is similar in structure to Slacker.  However, this one actually has a loose philsophical plot. Descartes idea that we can't decipher when we are awake and when we are sleeping is ever present. This leads to many different meetings with peaceful characters, violent ones, angry, vehemently idiological, and vehemently active people. Sometimes the main character can talk with these people and sometimes he's not even there as if he's a spirit listening. Regardless, he can't seem to get out of his dreams.  While he meets/observes these characters the animation is sometimes dreamlike, sometimes realistic, sometimes whimsically expressive of the characters making this a movie that accentuates the personalities of the speakers. Yes, this is a visual movie, but it's one with great depth and it's wouldn't be as interesting if it didn't make the audience ponder the numerous ideas that are brought forth. For the thinkers who also respect visual innovation
B000000WCA|4.0|I was a latecomer to the world of Spice, not buying their debut album until after I saw them in concert in June of '98, although I had liked all the singles. But I'm glad I bought it, as this is one disc I would gladly take with me if I were stuck on a desert island. This is the best album this group ever did, and they have rarely equaled it since, whether apart or together. Long live the Spice Girls!
B000002UAO|5.0|The Beatles show their versatility here, mixing rock and folk. I love the old pop albums, but this one shows some maturity, though &quot;Drive My Car&quot; is just a fun rocker.<br />Lots of great tunes here. I have the American vinyl and must say the British original blows that away. &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; is still a classic. I'm not a big fan of &quot;Michelle&quot; and the last song just isn't that good, especially the lyric, &quot;I'd rather see you dead little girl than catch you with another man.&quot; That shows the Beatles hadn't quite grown up completely, and it's vintage, cynical Lennon.<br />Other than those, it's another great Beatles album.

B000003TAR|5.0|. . . that the 5 stars here go to the quality of the songs on In Utero. When it comes to production values, *however*, I have a major bone to pick. I sometimes feel like kicking Steve Albini right in the ass. The music is SO LOUD on this record and the voices are so distant and faint it is often nauseating! And when you crank up the volume to hear the voice, it's STILL faint, but at that point the music becomes so loud that it starts to develop static. In any case, I only wish this was different, cause it took something away from the listening experience, obviously, especially on Pennyroyal Tea and Serve the Servants. <br />I can't really think of a 'standout' song on this record... each of the songs is so reservedly unique and wonderful on it's own. If I HAD to chose though, it would be All Apologies for, well, for everything.<BR>Scentless Apprentice is really strange. I have to give the band props for including songs like this one on a Nevermind follow-up (yes I *know* Incesticide came inbetween), especially right at the beginning as a second track. I also really like Tourette's, and I'm glad they included it, since I read it wasn't meant to be included initially.<br />The lyrics on In Utero are probably the best and most outrightly-poetic from all the Nirvana albums. My favorites: Dumb, Heart Shaped Box, Serve the Servants, Pennyroyal Tea, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter, and All Apologies.<br />As an aside, Unit Shifter is another one of those terribly-overlooked Nirvana songs (see: Incesticide) that most people of course have never heard of, unfortunately. <br />One of the things I love about Nirvana, as opposed to, say, Pearl Jam (who I am definitely NOT dissing), is that there's hardly any spectacle or overblown/grandiose production of the songs, and In Utero is the album that illustrates this especially well. Like I said already, it sounds humble, reserved and raw, and therefore, really unique.

B0000035E7|4.0|Bleach is one of those rare albums where all the songs go SO well together, and form a unity which makes a record extra special.<BR>I love Bleach, but the reason I am giving it 4 stars is that there are two songs I just plain don't like. I have tried, but still don't. For most other albums put out by today's bands, this would be a big accomplishment but since it is a rare case for me not to like something on Nirvana's records, I have to rate it more strictly. <BR>The songs are Floyd the Barber, and Downer. I don't know what it is about them, but I just tend to find them rather pointlessly obnoxious as opposed to hilariously obnoxious. <br />*(For the record, I think the SubPop people were stupid to refuse the song &quot;Beans&quot; because I found that one absolutely hilarious, and much MUCH better than either Floyd or Downer. But that's just me.)*<br />Having said that, I adore 9 of the 13 songs. I don't really see how Negative Creep, of all the songs, is the &quot;obvious standout&quot; but the band seems to have performed that one quite often, so maybe I'm alone at thinking that song is just okay.<br />Everything has already been said about About A Girl, and it deserves all the acolades. But my absolute favorite song on the album would have to be Sifting. Everything about it somehow seems special to me, and the music is fantastic. People say Cobain was less than impressive as a guitar player. Okay, yes, but personally, I think he carried the whole Bleach with that guitar, because on songs like Love Buzz, Mr. Moustache and Big Cheese I personally like the guitar parts better than the singing parts (some of the lyrics here are obviously less great than on the other Nirvana albums). Lastly, Cobain's voice is amazing on Bleach. That's a bit unusual considering this was the band's first album, but it has power and passion: an enormous roar as opposed to that grate that for some reason predominated on In Utero. Not that I'm dissing his grate.

B00005LC4B|2.0|If director Martin Scorsese ever made a throwaway film, this is it.<br />Cape Fear is a remake of a 1962 film of the same name. The story begins when a violent ex-con (Robert DeNiro) plots revenge on the lawyer (Nick Nolte) who put him behind bars. He begins harrassing the lawyer, but soon develops other plans when he sees that Nolte has a wife (Jessica Lange) and teenage daughter (Juliette Lewis).<br />Good premise. The problem is that Scorsese's film is a remake in the most literal sense of the word, and he goes so far as to use identical shots, dialogue, and even Bernard Herrmann's music from the original film. Like they said to Gus Van Sant when he remade &quot;Psycho&quot;: Why bother making a film that's already been made?<br />DeNiro, of course, is great even when in mediocre films, and Cape Fear is no exception. With his over-the-top Southern accent and overly tattooed body, he is funny and chilling at once. He also gets the film's best scene: at a screening of &quot;Problem Child&quot;, he puffs a cigar and yuks it up, to the chagrin of others in the audience. He's a vicious killer AND he talks during movies -- it doesn't get any worse than that, does it?<br />Viewers who don't mind the violence might get a kick out of DeNiro's performance. Everyone else would be well advised to get the original.
B00000K0DK|4.0|In order to survive the passing years, a film must be able to transcend the limitations of the era in which it was made.  This is a difficult test, particularly for films that largely rely upon new technology and innovative technique for impact: as these new effects are seen more often in other films, we come to accept them as standard, and in consequence the film that introduced them no longer has same the freshness as once it did.<br />To a certain extent CITIZEN KANE faces precisely this problem.  A pioneer in the use of deep focus photography and in innovative editing, KANE stunned audiences of its day with a powerful visual and aural montage.  Some forty years later, however, most filmgoers have had at least some opportunity to see other and later films that at least approximate KANE's effects; consequently, these elements lack the same impact they once had, and the film must increasingly rely upon story, script, and performances for continued appeal.  And it is here that KANE runs into a bit of trouble.  The story KANE tells is quite cold, and although the script has incredible precision, bite, and complexity, it ultimately presents its characters as second-rate personalities who prove unable to transform their lives into anything beyond the pathos they so deplore.  They are not likable enough to be sympathetic, they are not dark enough to fully stir our curiosity, and for all Charles Foster Kane's millions they ultimately emerge as merely so many opportunity-squandering unfortunates.  As such, while they certainly engage the viewer in an intellectual sense, they seldom engage the viewer in an emotional one; this coupled with the fact that the film's technique no longers offers quite the same shock-of-the-new as once it did makes CITIZEN KANE increasingly problematic with the passage of time.<br />There is a tremendous amount to admire in CITIZEN KANE, but with each passing year it becomes more and more of a historian's darling and less and less of a film that remains able to engage a purely casual viewer at all levels.  Even so, it is (and will no doubt for the foreseeable future remain) a landmark film, one that will be worthy of considerable reverence for many years to come.remains able to engage a purely casual viewer at all levels.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Christian, a struggling young poet, moves to 1899 Paris, joining the dark, fantastic world of the now legendary Moulin Rouge. Bedecked in the dazzling and newly-discovered electricity, Moulin Rouge introduces him to Satine, its most beautiful courtesan. Satine responds to his love, but nightclub owner Harold Zidler warns her to forget him. Her life is about satisfying men for the dollar. Not love. Zidler tells her: &quot;We're creatures of the underworld. We can't afford to love...&quot;. For Christian the doors to Moulin Rouge will only lead to sorrow...&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is exactly like those corny old musicals we all love--only completely different. An intoxicating entrance into the imaginative mind of master director Baz Luhrmann, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; has been nominated for 6 Golden Globe Awards. Fresh from her acclaimed role in the excellent horror-thriller &quot;The Others&quot;, Nicole Kidman sings and dances her way through &quot;M.R.&quot; with strength and clarity. Her co-star, Ewan McGregor, does not fare as well. McGregor played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; in 1999, and returns for &quot;Star Wars Episode II-Attack of the Clones&quot; in 2002, and &quot;Star Wars III&quot; in 2005. English born Jim Broadbent is superb as feisty showman Harold Zidler. Producer, director, and co-writer Baz Luhrmann filmed &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; in 1992. He directed Leonardo Di Caprio in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1996. The Australian director invested 4 years on &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, his third film. The music of &quot;M.R.&quot; is integrated masterfully between pathos, mad humor and green absinthe. The lead actors sing standards by the Beatles, Elton John, Madonna, Sting, and more, all with their own voices. The only original song, &quot;Come What May&quot;, is in fact the best. Fox's brand new &quot;M.R.&quot; DVD is 2:35.1 anamorphic widesreen DTS 5.1 Dolby Digital and THX. It's flawless. Disk 1 gives you the 2 hour movie and 2 separate commentary audio tracks. That's 6 hours of entertainment.  Disk 2, over 3 hours long, has a documentary, interviews, bios, photos and detailed reviews of set design, dance, music, and more. There are 2 videos of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;. You need 9 hours to see it all just once. &quot;M.R.&quot; has 8 Easter Eggs. To find one hidden on Disk 2, go to Main Menu and select &quot;This Story is About&quot;. In the next menu, highlight &quot;Old Storylines and Script&quot;. In that menu, select the Return key. Now press the &quot;Right&quot; arrow on your remote control and a green fairy will appear. Press &quot;Enter&quot; and watch the director spout some off-color language. The other 7 Easter Eggs can be found on the Internet. A big, brassy colorful romp spinning 90 miles-per-hour,&quot;M.R.&quot; is a musical-comedy tragedy about love. As our young writer says: &quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return&quot;.

B00005RHGK|1.0|If I could have given it 0 stars I would have! This movie was absolutely terrible from beginning to end. First of all, even a crazy erson wouldn't do half of the things that the two main characters did. If you just saw someone throwin 2 bodies down a huge pipe why would you turn back around to go see if they're alive. Second, if you saw a head without a body attached hit your car window why would you get out the car to see who, what, where, and why!? This movie was poorly written, directed, produced, and the lighting was terrible. There too many parts of the movie where you could see absolutely nothing. This movie gave me a headache and I'm so glad I didn't waste $... to see it in a movie theater(I rented it). I would have been pissed. I f you have never seen this movie please don't waste your time watching it, even when it comes out on cable or even regular TV.

6304383827|5.0|While I am generally not a fan of Paltrow (and I usually leave her films feeling that she is just too over-rated as an actress) I have to admit to finding her charming in this light-hearted rendition of Emma.  Emma, not my favorite Austen story, contains perhaps Austen's silliest characters, but her humor is well served here, and I recommend this version highly.

B00005R87Q|1.0|I fully understood that this would be an action movie based on a cookie-cutter plot. What the hey, I just wanted some escapism. But it wasn't quite so.<br />Oh, there's action. But not at the pace I expected. It's here and there, between overlong stretches of ... uh ... &quot;plot.&quot;<br />And when the action arrives, it isn't that stupendous. Mostly sequences of cars going very fast ... in a straight line. Not terribly interesting. Some shots of cars in formation were kind of nice to look at, though.<br />There are a couple of good stunts, but you saw them all in the previews. They provide some interesting visuals, but that's about all.<br />The human angle is laughable. The romantic interest is wafer-thin on plausibility. Unless you're really into how these cars are souped up on nitro, I don't recommend a buy.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I don't think that anyone has been as diverse as Prince over the past 30 years, and now he jumps head first into the realm of funk-jazz.  The music arrangements are amazing, and he lets the new comers in music (DeAngelo, Bilal, Badu) that he can funk with the best of them.  Some people may be disturbed by the BIG BROTHER like voice that booms on portions of the CD, and the religious overtones.  But whatever happened to appreciating originality and the dairingness to stretch the boundaries of both music and your mind?<br />My personal favorites are &quot;Willing to do the work&quot; and &quot;Mellow&quot;, but the whole CD is a ride through fantasia
B00003CXZ1|1.0|The trailers looked pretty fun, right? As long as I wasn't expecting anything Shakespearean, it might be entertaining, right?<br />Wrong.<br />The plot ... the plot ... the pain. In the abrupt climax, the villains, the fabled Illuminati, turn out to be chumps. And talk about abrupt! You don't realize that was actually the big finish (so to speak) until the credits roll and ... wait, that was it?<br />Lara Croft also dispatches huge stone monsters with ridiculous ease, and bullets from her little guns.<br />Is this review incoherent? Yes, have some. Well, that's the feeling you get after seeing this movie.

B00005JKT8|2.0|The movie was a good idea, but they just didn't deliver.  I have enjoyed Meg's performance in other movies, but it is obvious that she is burnt out in K&amp;L.  She looks like she hasn't slept in weeks, but more importantly her acting is very lackluster at best.  And the script!  What studio exec let this script out of development?  There are so many holes in the plot - such as Kate has expressed no desire to visit Leopold's time period, add the fact that a modern-day independent woman would have to face a life of having no voice in her own affairs or society, why would she want to go back?  And why didn't Stuart notice Kate when he took her picture?  You mean he wouldn't notice his own ex?  K&amp;L's love affair in the present is unconvincing.  There was no conflict.  There is no chain of cause &amp; effect.  There are too many coincidences.  Neither of the main characters experienced any change or development.  They should have sent the writer back to Screenplays 101!

1857993284|2.0|Basically this is a bit of pro philosophy propoganda. A young girl recieves a mysterious letter asking her some questions about her identity. You know, not like her name but in reality who is she. She then starts to recieve an course in philosophy. <br />The book is moderately interesting as it keeps us wonderning who our heroine is and who is the mysterious Major in the peace keeping force in Lebanon. <br />Basically however it is an attempt to popularize philosophy as an area of interlectual interest. It doesn't do a bad job but the reality is that philosophy is dying. <br />It was a thought system which developed in the Greek world to supply a non religous explanation of natural phenomena. At the time of Hume we had a split. Hume developed a theory of empirical knowledge and rejected all of the complex systems which had been developed prior to him. Philosophy very much lives on as a historical study into these old thought systems which have little value in the real world. <br />After Hume philosophy tended to become an ethical and historical area. The rise of science has marginlised it in life and also in academic institutions. <br />This book doesn't really look at whether philosophy is a live discipline. In fact the only critism it makes of the discipline is of Plato's theory of forms. Still attempts to popularise things seldom are in depth studies so that one should not complain to much. <br />If you are interested in learning about philosophy from someone who likes it this is your book. If you are sceptical about it steer away.
B000009QPE|2.0|First of all, the only reason this CD gets 2 stars is because 1 star rating is reserved for Limp Bizkit-type bands. This CD is nothing more than pounding, pounding, and more pounding. Lyrics sound like 6th grader wrote them. If musical assault means beating drums as fast as you can and yelling \\"Hell, Suffering, Evil..\\" as many time as possible, and for guitar player to try to play as fast as he can not carrying about how melodic the riffs are, than this is the CD for you. This can't even begin to compare to most Panthera's work, let alone to old Metallica's masterpieces \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\".[...]

His father has regained rights to the music and has re-mastered and re-releasaed it all.  It is Incredible, you can hear every instrument, the vocal track.  It is so clear that Jimi literally jumps out of the speakers at you.  The tracks are Jimi's biggest, they speak for themselves, but It does include \\"Redhouse\\".

B00005RHGK|4.0|This is a really scary movie, I'm really surprised more people didn't recommend it here. It heald my attention from start to finish. It's the kind of original horror movie that they haven't made since films such as In the Mouth of Madness and Lord of Illusions. Plus the end is gutsy, left me pale and speechless, it's both disturbing yet it has some dark humor to it too. This is a creepy film, almost creepier than the director's backround, lol.
B00004W199|5.0|Herk Harvey's CARNIVAL OF SOULS is considered among the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of cult-dom, and with very good reason.  With a plot that plays like a lost episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and a luminous star like Candace Hilligoss, how can this film NOT have a cult following?!<br />Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) and her two girlfriends challenge two slack-jawed yokels to a drag race, before crashing off a bridge and sinking into the inky depths of the river below.<br />Mary is found emerging from a river bank, covered in mud and clearly traumatised.  She later gets a job playing the organ in the local church before being offered another gig in a nearby state.  This is where the fun starts.  Mary is taunted and haunted by images of zombies and a &quot;Man&quot; (Herk Harvey himself) that appers everywhere with a lewd expression etched on his ashen-white face.  Periodically Mary crosses over into a new plane of existence where there is no sound and she is seemingly invisible.<br />Mary begins to panic, for &quot;they&quot; have come for her for the last time, begging her to dance with &quot;them&quot; at the carnival of souls held just for her...<br />The ending is still a supremely affecting one, and still gets me every time.  With Sidney Berger, Stan Levitt, Larry Sneegas, Tom McGinnis and Art Ellison.  Filmed mostly in and around the small town of Lawrence, Kansas.

B00004XPPK|4.0|Rita Hayworth stars with Glenn Ford in the film noir masterpiece GILDA, which is widely considered to be the finest film in Ms Hayworth's career.<br />Gilda (Hayworth) is a young woman trapped in a loveless marriage with corrupt illegal casino owner Ballin Mundson (George MacReady) when she comes face-to-face with her past; Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) her previous lover whom she left and married Ballin on the rebound.<br />Gilda and Johnny re-ignite the passions when Ballin &quot;kills&quot; himself.  Little do they know that Ballin has suspected Gilda of infidelity and has left the picture so he may observe - and kill her - if she shows any indiscretion.<br />Featuring Hayworth's galvanising renditions of &quot;Put The Blame On Mame&quot; and &quot;Amado Mio&quot; (although her vocals were dubbed here by Anita Ellis) , this is the ultimate vehicle for the legendary sex-goddess.<br />The film has been fully restored by the American Film Archive for its glittering DVD debut, which also includes the trailer as well as a Rita Hayworth tribute from the Columbia Studios documentary &quot;The Lady with the Lamp&quot;
B00005QDW1|2.0|As another review stated, don't compare this to past No Doubt albums. Indeed, their sound has changed --and of course, it's nice to see a band grow and experiment. Overall, this is pretty much a fun and poppy album. But even as a stand alone album, it's heavily disappointing. Not all of the songs are like this, but the majority of it is dull and repetitive. What do I mean? I start listening to the song, it sounds good with a lot of potential and promis, but then it starts to repeat the same tune again and again for the next three or four minutes. Wait, where's the beginning, middle and end? Good as mindless background music or lift-me up/relaxer, but not spectacular.
B00005BJPO|3.0|I decided to start with the 2nd disc because it seemed to have the most material on it. It took me about 3 days; on and off to pretty much see everything the disc had to offer. That alone makes this DVD truly worth the purchase. Unfortunately, they descided to mess around with the the movie; (disc 1). Big mistake! The audio was superb but, the new voice-overs had me screaming at the TV., &quot;If it's not broken, then don't fix it&quot;! I found the new voice &quot;actors&quot; to be EXTREMELY irritating and without NY. style accents. They were able to successfully suck the energy out of the film. Over all, the movie looks the crispiest it's ever been. I strongly suggest if you've never seen Akira before to pick it up. For the rest of us, whether you get it for the interviews, story boards, and trailers on disc 2 or just as a great collectors purchase, be forewarned, and please for your own sanity, turn ON the subtitles.
B00005R2IS|5.0|I first watched Mad Max on a cheap VHS copy. I already knew that the cult film had its audio dubbed over for American audiences, but I still cringed when I heard the actors voices. It was terrible! And although I enjoyed the film (although not as much as its successors) the US dub made it feel extremely cheap. Well, with this new DVD release of the film, complete with original Australian dialogue, it felt like I was watching a brand new film! You can switch between that track and the US dub for a good laugh. Also included on this disc are a Mel Gibson documentary, an interesting behind the scenes featurette and a great trivia track that displays fun facts about the film during key scenes. A great package.
B00005NOOH|3.0|Short and sweet.  Great documentary, love it.
0684800713|5.0|Set on Paris' Left Bank, and then in Pamplona Spain, the story surrounds the narrator Jake Barnes and Brett Asley.  Jake is an American journalist who has been severely wounded in the war, while Brett Ashley is an English aristocrat, flamboyant and so irresistible.<br />It is the year of 1920 and the post World War 1 expatriates cling to each other to find solace, as they alleviate the tragedy and depression of the war with Pernod  and Champagne sessions and gourmet meals.<br />The potpourri of characters consist of the Jewish boxer and tennis player Robert Cohn, who has a thirst for travel like all of his cronies; Billy Gorton the novelist; Michael Campbell Brett's fiance; beautiful Brett the brilliant chatterbox who steals the show at every given chance; and of course Jake, so cruelly wounded where no one can see.<br />The book is marvellously entertaining as they leave the cafes of Paris for a sojourn to Spain to take in the famous bullfighting, and to enjoy a change of scenery.  They continue their pleasure-seeking but then there is some strain and tension amongst certain parties which will inevitably lead to dissappointments.<br />This is a beautiful story and an ideal read for the beach or to take on a vacation.  I gave it five stars.  Don't miss it!!!<br /><br />Reviewed by Heather Marhsall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE) January 16th, 2002
1587990717|5.0|The book is very rigorous albeit in a little cavalier tone of voice which can get irritating for those unused to reading such texts devoid of the usual formalism. He may be too idiosyncratic.<BR>1) I went and checked the example on page 167, which seems to correspond to a periodic function with noise. The noise can be removed using many possible methods (including Fourier transform or smoothing kernels used in stat). Nonacademic reviewers making statements should update their textbooks and/or not focus on trivialities.<BR>2)Taleb has sometimes a tendency to tempt you with a topic and then forget about it. He should have made the book a little longer...or perhaps write another.
B00005JKES|5.0|Lynch and Frost are amazing with their sense of directing and writing of the TP series. I recently purchased this dvd set and watched all the episodes over 5 days and was amazed by the clarity and authenticity of the series.  Its stands out far beyond anything I have ever seen. I just wish the other seasons where available because I can not wait to see what happens next!  Does anyone know when the second season will be coming out on dvd?
B000009M5E|5.0|Others have commented on the performance.  There are things I could imagine being done better -- Serafin, while generally excellent, can be a bit syrupy; I'd prefer a less thin-voiced and soubrettish Musetta than D'Angelo; the Schaunard muffs a couple of good comic opportunities.  But overall, this has as high a standard of performance as any BOHEME recording -- and the best part is, it's an ALL-ITALIAN performance (or nearly all; I think D'Angelo may have been Italian-American), and it really does help, especially in the comic scenes, that all the singers know what they're singing about.<br />Next, the sound.  It took me a couple of listens to get used to the style of sound used here, but I soon came to be impressed by it, and finally to love it.  The singers are not really distant; it's just that they're recorded in somewhat realistic perspective, as you might get in the opera house.  This creates a real feeling of a stage picture, helped by the fact that the recording was &quot;staged&quot; in the studio: Most of the sound effects were done simultaneously with the music rather than being superimposed afterwards, and the stereo stage movement is meant to simulate a stage performance, so that you hear not only entrances and exits, but movements that correspond to all sorts of stage actions (though of course the singers are usually dead-center for their arias!).  The sense of atmosphere conjured up by producer Erik Smith is quite phenomenal: The beginning of act 3, with the offstage and onstage action played out in differing perspectives, makes you almost feel like you're there watching and &gt;feeling&lt; it happen before you.  Many audiophile friends of mine consider this the best-sounding opera recording ever made.  I'm no audiophile, but I'm inclined to agree; in sonic terms it outclasses even Decca's Freni-Pavarotti recording, and runs rings around most of today's claustrophobic digital recordings.<br />Even at full price, this would be my first choice among BOHEME recordings; at this price, it's one of the great bargains in the operatic catalogue (though you'll have to find a libretto and translation somewhere else).
B00004RF8J|4.0|Anyone who's gotten this far probably has a pretty good ides of the plot of this movie; boy-gets-plant, plant-gets-people, boy-gets-girl, etc.<br />But the difference between the stage and film versions of this musical gives ma a chance to talk about the difference between stage and film musicals and why i hardly ever really like the latter. (With the exception of &quot;Guys &amp; Dolls&quot; and &quot;The Music Man&quot;...)<br />As Frank Oz remarks in his (excellent) Director's Commentary, the original ending of the stage version is acceptable and funny... because we know the actors will be taking curtain calls in short order.  That's the point; a stage musical is, obviously, Not Reality.  The sets are basically flat (sometimes exaggeratedly so, for effect), costumes, makeup, action and voice performances are exaggerated to carry past the proscenium, and lighting and other technical aspects constantly remind us that It's Just A Play.<br />Conversely, we have been taught, by cultural factors and simple assimilation, that a movie is, in some way, Reality.  Look -- it's out in the street, moving around!  We can go from one building to another and see that they (apparently)have Real Interiors.  Makeup, costume and so on are more subtle. (For an example of what this is like, see if you can find photos of the &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; cast in the stage versions of their costumes and makeup and in the film versions; see how differently the same person/character is done for the different media) It just plain Looks Real.<br />And so -- for me, anyway, when all of the strangers not only know the owrds but sing perfect five part harmonies on the spir of the moment, i can't deal with it in the movie,but have no problem with it on stage.<br />And the original ending of this film -- on film -- was much more final and much more of a downer than it would be live, where, as i said, we know that the cast are gonna be taking curtain calls as soon as the last number (&quot;Don't Feed the Plants&quot;, i believe) is over.  And test audiences told them so, emphatically.<br />And so, with reluctance, they went back and reshot the end of the film, giving it a happy ending (though even then they couldn't help slipping a little foreboding/foreshadowing...), and re-edited a couple of other places where the audience had been a bit grossed out.<br />As Oz says, he didn't like to, but this is a business, and if you don't please the audience...<br />A Few Notes On Production Values:  The Skid Row exterior set is about the largest interior studio set i have ever seen (it compares favourably with the set Hitchcock built for &quot;Rear Window&quot;); several stories high, a couple of blocks long, lovingly detailed.  If i ever raise enough money to make a film based on Will Eisner's &quot;Sprit&quot; comic, i want that set to film on.  It has that air of deep urban realism, almost hyper-realism, that so much of Eisner's work has.<br />Oz's commentary on some of the technical decisions made in getting the best possible result are interesting:<br />I am particularly impressed by the crane shot that begins at Audrey's apartment window and in one continuous movement ends on Crystal, Chiffon and Ronette (the film's girl-group-style &quot;Greek Chorus&quot;) on a building roof half-a-block away; Oz reveals that they rigged a camera crane *on* a camera crane to get the necessary moves and range of action.<br />In order to make the plant's movements seem quicker and more fluid (the final version weighed something like half a ton and required the services of fifty-plus puppeteers to animate), they were undercranked -- shot at slower-then-normal speeds (12 frames per second and/or 16 fps versus the normal 24 fps) to cause them to appear faster when projected at mormal speeds.  Unfortunately, several of these scenes require on-screen interaction beween the plant and Rick Moranis... which meant that Moranis had to act at half or three-quarters speed to look as if he wereacting normally in the final result.  He even had to lip-synch to a track slowed down to 3/4 of its original speed.  He did it beautifully.<br />'S'a great fillum.  Great stuff on the DVD.  Buy it.  You won't regret it.acting normally in the final result.  He even had to lip-synch to a track slowed down to 3/4 of its original speed.  He did it beautifully.<br />'S'a great fillum.

6305077630|5.0|John Hughs directed a film that some have considered not up to par with the other high class of films over the years.  However with Wierd Sicence John Hughs would place a film with cult statis.  Of course let's not forget such preformances from Anthony Micahel Hall and Kelly Lebrock.  This film is really for those with a fondness for the strange the bizzare and quite frankly a bit of strange taste to everything life has to offer.  It doesn't matter if you have a VCR or a DVD player this is one of those movies you have to have in your collection.
B000002LRX|5.0|Unfortunately for those reading this who are 20 and under, probably the only FNM you have been exposed to is the overplayed to death \\"Epic\\". There is much more to this band than Epic. Angel Dust is a mindblowing journey of rock music. It's what a band can do when they throw the rule book out the window and get on with creating meaningful music. What makes it even more wondrous is that Angel Dust isn't simply avant garde noise and weirdness for weirdnesses sake..it's got actual songwriting. Songwriting that most other bands would give their eye-teeth for to produce. It's tragic in this day and age all we hear on the radio is play by the rules nu-metal and derivative second generation alt-grunge. As one reviewer once said these nu-metal bands \\"never met a rule they didn't obey\\". Discover Faith No More, a band that could give a ...... about rules.
B00000016K|5.0|I feel ridiculous writing a review of a Cream album because everyone already knows they are among the best bluesy classic rock bands and are essential to any collection. For those who might not be aware, however, this is an album to own and play to death, at a loud setting (definitely at 11). The first half was recorded in the studio and has many classic guitar phrases we've all heard whether we knew what it was or not. Other chords and breaks are still fresh after all these years. Cream has been such a powerful influence that some of it sounds like current MTV stuff. The second CD is from live concerts and gives satisfyingly long guitar, drum and harmonica solos. If you want the ultimate Cream experience, get this one.
6304698623|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. So well-acted and well-made. Leisel Matthews is a very good actress, and she does a great job at portraying young Sara Crewe, the little girl who is sent to a strict boarding school by her gentle and loving father, who must go serve in the war. When Captain Crewe (Sara's father) is believed to have been killed in battle, Sara is devastated, but she decides to have as much optimism as she can. Though the coldhearted mistress of the school, Miss Minchin, forces Sara to become a servant, Sara's spirit does not die. Miss Minchin takes away all of Sara's pretty things and attempts to take her \\"princess\\" title away, but Sara will never give up belief that she and all other girls are princesses, mainly because her beloved father has told her so. Sara develops a close bond with Becky, who is also a servant at the school. Throughout the movie, Sara's strength and her kind nature will enchant everyone who watches the film. It is truly an uplifting story. It's my favorite version of \\"the little princess,\\" and it definitely deserves 5 stars. I'd give it 10 if I could.
B0000067L2|5.0|When you've heard all of Hendrix a thousand times and are desperate for more, but not the same, you must turn to Cream's psychedelic bluesy classic rock! Great tunes, great solos, by the best rock stylists of their time. One great thing about Cream is that whether in the studio or live, they remain fresh and this album is proof. I realize that saying Disraeli Gears is the best Cream album (over Wheels of Fire) is setting myself up for a fight, but there it is. Every song is a major one, with the most immitated rock guitar tracks of all time (the only exception being Stairway to Heaven). Plus, it is most distinctively Cream, whereas the other albums have integrated many licks and styles that can be found on Hendrix and other blues and rock artists' albums. That doesn't stop me from owning and playing the heck out of them, but establishes, for me, that Disraeli Gears is the supreme achievement of the band.
B000002LGW|5.0|\\"101\\" is truly a compilation of their greatest songs from 1980-1988 and it does not disappoint. Only one or two songs seem to be \\"fillers\\" (\\"Pimpf\\" and \\"The Things You Said\\"); the remaining songs are great are among Depeche Mode's best.<br />If one wants to buy only one Depeche Mode album and/or purchase only one to find out what they are like, (at least '80s Depeche Mode) this is definitely the one to purchase. The only downside is that Dave Gahan screaming and yelling -chants of \\"yeah!\\" and \\"go!\\"- dozens of times throughout every song (to pump up the audience and \\"get them into the songs\\") rapidly becomes annoying.
B000002KGT|5.0|From first track (Second Hand News) to last (Gold Dust Woman), easily the most complete and consistently good album ever recorded. Better than Sgt. Pepper and in the same league as Dark Side of the Moon, Are You Experienced, Abey Road and Pet Sounds.
B000002KN8|4.0|Speak &amp; Spell, the work of keyboardist, Vincent Clarke (who I've followed throughout his 20 year career with Depeche Mode, Yaz, and Erasure) is oddly cheesy, yet cool at the same time.  It's obvious when listening to the music that the Depeche Mode band members were just beginning their careers -the lyrics are pretty cheesy and the songs are kind of weird and silly- but notwithstanding, the melodies, though generally simple, are funky and cool as are the synthesizer tones that Clarke employs.  In fact, for a number of reasons, this is one of my favorite Depeche Mode albums.  Although, Clarke has come a LONG ways since Speak &amp; Spell (in the right direction), I still consider this album one of the cooler 80's synthesizer pop albums to have ever been developed.
0780020693|5.0|fellini is a filmmaking god.  filmmakers arent really gods but hes really really good.  this film, amarcord, i havent even seen but im sure to watch it tomorrow.  la strada was so great because of gelsomina and when she smiles.  the score is great too.  i have very high expectations for this film.  if its no good, i will be beyond letdown.  after all, it did cost 35 dollars.
B000002LK1|4.0|Violator is not only Depeche Mode's last 80s album (it was actually released in 1990) but it's also their last GOOD album. Beginning with \\"Songs Of Faith And Devotion\\" -when Depeche jettisoned their keyboards in favor of the Alt. Rock scene- D.M. began a creativity decline from which they never recovered.  It's too bad that they didn't retire after Violoator, their last good album and maybe their best, also.<br />Violator follows in the footsteps of the formulaic mid '80s Depeche Mode releases with very dark, gothic lyrics and music and a perfect combination of upbeat, dancy songs and slower ones.  Violator is probably, in fact, the darkest, most gothic D.M. album of all.  The synthesizer tones are extremely heavy and stark and sometimes eldritch as they mimic human growls and breathing.  Although the array of synth tones employed in songs is a little more spartan and minimalistic, the end result is that most the songs are among the best that Depeche Mode has ever developed.  Alan Wilder's keyboard arrangements are stellar.  My favorite songs are \\"World In My Eyes,\\" and \\"Policy Of Truth.\\"<br />Violator would've been near perfect had it included the B-side: \\"Happiest Girl,\\" which is one of the darkest and best D.M. songs I've ever heard.  As it stands, Violator is probably the second best album after \\"101.\\"  It's too bad that 101 wasn't released directly after Violator was -so that it could have included the best hits from Violator as well as the best of D.M. from '81-'87.
B00003CXC7|5.0|&quot;Rear Window&quot; is widely considered as one of Hitchcock's best, and there is good reason for this. I am no film critic, but I do know when a movie is good or not after I see it. In such a small neighborhood setting all throughout the film, Mr. Hitchcock is able to generate considerable viewer-interest and suspense as he affords us a window-sized view into the lives of the tenants living in the surrounding apartments. We see these through the eyes of our hero, who for the moment is tied to the wheelchair with one leg in full brace. It is through the idle hours of doing nothing where he begins to look out of the window and observe (spy is a more fitting word) more closely the lives of his neighbors. The dilemma starts when he begins to suspect one of them as having committed murder.<br />Let's face it, to some degree, every human being has a taste for voyeurism (although, the nature of voyeurism in this film is not largely sexual : only one scene where our protagonist sees, through a small window which only exposed the head, the young woman living across his apartment taking a shower.) The movie knows this, and aptly capitalizes on this knowledge. James Stewart stars, and Grace Kelly, as the leading lady, has never been more beautiful and captivating. The cast is first rate.
B000002LCI|2.0|Based on several reader reviews, I bought this album and ended up severely disappointed.<br />In a nutshell, there are only two or three really good songs (especially, NEVER LET ME DOWN AGAIN) and the remaining tracks seem to be experiments in synthesizer sampling without any actual melody.<br />Other than \\"Contstruction Time Again\\" this is probably the only other '80s DM release that I loathe.  Much better alternatives to this album are \\"Black Celebration\\" and \\"Some Great Reward.\\"
B00005ATQG|4.0|All actors very good indeed.Shot in cool,stark black and white.Not too many longeurs,good music and Peter Sellers a stand-out.
B000002LB6|4.0|Erasure's break-through album, The Circus, is a considerable improvement over their debut, Wonderland, and up to this day remains one of their best releases of all.<br />Every song could make an excellent single and represents Vince Clarke's creativity at his highest apex.  And although Clarke progressed over the years, adding complexity to his melodies and different arrays of synth tones to his repertoire, The Circus remains one of Erasure's most endearing, poignant, and emotional albums.
B00005QK3W|5.0|o.k. enough of that!   first off I would just say to those who have gone to the trouble of writing negative reviews, that perhaps you are looking at this music; d'une oreille distraite,( with half an ear). not always a bad thing, but I will tell you why I say this. I was not planning on buying this recording, but I found a cassette of driving rain in san remo(at a price I could not refuse, ha ha...) and this being italy and not monte carlo I could not refuse, no??  truthfully I did not expect to like it, but it is great driving music! especially here on the cote d'azur. so now I must go and buy the disc version. I would recommend this disc to anyone who likes what I would call happy music(it comes through that way). paul is sounding once again literally, au temps de sa verte jeunesse! if you know what I mean! probably that squeeze, heather, has something to do with that!! the first track, 'lonely road' is excellent!  the vocals are right up there with, 'why dont we do it in the road'. especially when he sings near the end, 'I dont wanna, I dont wanna. paul sounds like an old angry black man( which is 100% a compliment and should only be taken as such). and would'nt it be great if we could time travel back and take some of these tracks and sort of send them through a transmogrification process and see what we come up with.....o.k. so I'm not really touching on all of the tracks here as that would take way too much time. there are 3 tracks I would have cut from the final list( you can decide which three) however ,the 4th track of the disc, driving rain, is quite possibly the best driving song you will ever need to hear. the 10 minute track is a great jam, with great vocals and great teasing guitar bits near the end and I would'nt have minded had it gone on minutes longer.( a final note if paul is listening or reading this; my line-up for the ultimate pop band would be paul on bass, piano and vocals. neil finn,  vocals and guitar.  johnny marr, guitar. karl wallinger(world party) , vocals and guitar. ringo on drums of course.  daniel lanois producing(perhaps doing a  guest vocal en francais) and providing atmospheric guitars which he does so well. maybe even brian eno,  providing sonic distress. o.k. guys thats it. read this. get it together. get it rolling. take a few years if you have to. we'll be waiting......) please let it be a case of, sitot dit, sitot fait!
B000002NJS|5.0|This is the best CD she has ever made. I first heard the song Ray Of Light when i was 9 years old when my dad bough the cd.. I FELL IN LOVE!  From 1994 bed time stories... was a great cd with songs like human nature and secret big hits.. but she kinda went away for 4 years. ya she did have something to rember but that had old hits and only one new one. I am sorry to say this but i am glad ( not in a bad way ) she dissipeared for 4 years. She didnt dissipear but she has a little girl ( lourdes ) and was in Evita etc. etc... but She made the best cd. She has lots of good cd but this tops it all.  i would recomcde it to anyone!! its my favotite cd...<br />  Holly! MG
6303471714|5.0|I have used this video off and on since it first came out.  Although she sometimes moves quicker than I prefer, I simply slow down and/or reduce the number of repetitions according to how I'm feeling (you really do have to listen to your own body).  I consider this a great exercise video because I haven't found anything that (along with nutritious dieting) tones me faster or better and actually makes me feel more energetic in the long run, and I'm 51 years old.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|This album shows Lenny's diversity. If you happen to see Lenny's Behind the Music segment on VH1, it adds a lot to the songs, due to his marriage breakup, and other tragedies he has had. The Greatest Hits is more a biography, then a collection of great songs.
0679879269|4.0|It took him long enough to write it! But...it was worth it. *some minor spoilers ahead* Philip Pullman outshines once more, with epic characters and landscapes. It was a bit dull around the edges (it seems as though he had a bit of a formula in mind going into writing this book) but above that it was spectacular. <br />Probably the best scene in the book was the &quot;Stalemate&quot; scene with Coulter and the Gallivesipians...I giggled like an excited schoolgirl when I read it. Sadly, that is probably the highest climax the book reaches. This scene was something different for Pullman...he usually builds up to the climactic scenes, as he has done in previous books and in the latter part of this book...<br />We revisited many old friends in this one (both expected and unexpected ones) Many of the older subjects he dealt with (Dust of course) reappear in this one. It's pretty apparent Pullman's an Atheist and it shows with the reiteration of the &quot;Killing the Authority&quot; theme. This book is much more theological than the other two (using both theological themes and imagery) <BR>****BIG SPOILER UP AHEAD****<br />Although comedy is not Pullman's strong suit, he definetly shows us his dark comedic side in the scene where the cliff-ghasts pound the life out of the Authority (God, obviously) while he is still inside his little cage. It's kinda like Fargo when you see the foot sticking out of the wood chipping machine. <br />**spoilers end** <br />Overall, this book brings to a graceful close this amazing saga. He excelled in tying together all three books with Dust. If you are going for a stand alone read I definetly recommend The Golden Compass, it is still the best of the three. The Subtle Knife (much more of a transition between 1 and 3, as opposed to a stand alone novel) does a very good job in introducing Will and making parallel dimensions a more dominant theme. I would give this novel a 5 except for a few things... *medium-sized spoilers up ahead*<br />1) The raw emotion from scenes like Bolvangar and Svalbard (from book 1) were not very present. <br />2) If taken as a stand-alone novel, the ending is only slightly above average (tying the whole saga together though, it really does make sense and is not so bad) <br />*spoilers*<br />3) There are a few incongruencies now and then...if you notice in book 2, Lyra sees Will &quot;without a daemon&quot;. Shortly after she realizes that it's inside of him...Well if that were true then how come in book 3 Serafina says to Mary that &quot;Everyone has a daemon and can be seen through practice&quot; (or whatver the line is) if in our world we don't have daemons? (ie physical manifestions of our souls)Mary should not have been able to see her daemon since she doesn't really have one (and did not cross over to the world of the dead either, for that matter). <br />Final Complaint: I mentioned this before but...It seemed as though Pullman had a formula now and then (ex: The Land of the Dead...striking parallel to the Bolvangar scene in book 1. Seems as if he tried to recreate it) He definetly did not top himself by using this formula. Only now and then did his true genius from the first book shine through. <br />But..All in all, Pullman gracefully brought the plane down with minor turbulence. Good Job.
6305090564|5.0|Okay, if you're into deep meaning and subtitles this is not a movie for you. However, if you fondly remember the Saturday afternoon creature feature, you really should put this in your library. The plot is mostly predictable - goodhearted smuggler meets girl and must save her from large sea creature and money  grubbing bad guy. There are some great gross scenes and Kevin McDonald is a classic comedy foil. This is an all around fun movie.
B00003CXXP|5.0|My number one pick is David Lynch's Mulholland Drive.<br />Most people i talk to dislike A.I. immensely.  But, when i ask them why, all they say is &quot;Spielberg stinks&quot;.<br />Being myself one who generally leans toward a dislike of the trademark spielberg sappiness, i was pleasantly surprised by this film.  it is far from perfect, i'll be the first to admit, and i would have loved to have seen a Kubrick directed version of it.. but Kubrick, sadly, is no longer with us.  Even he, before his death, recognized that this film was better suited to Spielberg.  I respect that.  And i absolutely loved this film.  Visually, emotionally, conceptually, and philosophically, it is not one you'll soon forget, unless you go into it with a closed mind and a hate for all things spielberg.  But, then again, if you watch movies with that kind of attitude, you're likely to miss alot of the great cinematic efforts of your time.  Perhaps AI isn't quite the Mona Lisa of film, but few are, and AI has more meaning and depth in the first 15 minutes alone than 90% of the garbage Hollywood has released in its entire existence put together.
B000001FI7|5.0|I always knew that Portishead is a band worth checking out yet it always turned out that I preferred to invest my money in other bands. No more. I thought that \\"Glory Box\\" is but a nice song (Has anyone but me ever noticed the striking similarity between this song & Neneh Cherry's \\"Woman\\"?)- It never convinced me enough to buy Portishead's albums. However when I saw the video for \\"Only You\\" (From the sophomore album) one night on an alternative music programme I felt the beauty & delicacy this band projects enough to buy both of their albums (There's also the live album from NYC however I'm against live albums- The subject of a completely different article tho'). Dummy is the debut, the album that started triphop as we know it today. Sure, many would say that Massive Attack were already making the triphop revolution back there in 1991 with their debut Blue Lines; However Portishead has managed to improve Massive's dub/hiphop oriented style, creating a cold/warm effect comprised of precise drummachines (Checkout the wonderful \\"Sour Times\\" for example), electric organ chords, an occasion turntable scratch & Beth Gibbon's tender voice to float above it all, creating a stark contrast. If the sound of this album sounds familiar to you it's only because every feminocentred triphop act that is active today has tried hopelessly to emulate it. Dummy, on the other hand, is where it all began. Make no mistake- This is not a breathtaking masterpiece reminiscent of, say, Radiohead's OK Computer; But on the other hand it is exceedingly indulging & enjoyable, rewarding to the ones who are willing to put all of their focus on the album- To listen to it in a closed room, with a high quality stereosystem so they could feel the beats pounding in their blood & Beth's vocals carressing them smoothly, creating a form of art so exquisite that they can do nothing but embrace it with the utmost love & appreciation. It just ain't gonna work otherwise. The album works best on wintry days butthen again, it should let the winter in each & every time you play it.
B00005QIPH|3.0|Any time I hear a band compared to Television, I have to check them out (Television was, in my opinion, one of the greatest bands of all time). After reading numerous comparisons between The Strokes and Television, I decided buy the CD.  What I found was a solid band with catchy songs, but one that broke no new ground.  One tune reminded me of Iggy Pop, another sounded like the Velvet Underground and one had Stereolab written all over it. Other than ocassional Tom Verlaine-like riffs from the guitarist, this band is hardly comparable to the ground breaking sounds of Television.  The Strokes are obviously influenced by Television and other 70's punk and new wave bands, but they bring nothing new to the table.  Most critics put &quot;This Is It&quot; on their 10 ten CD's of 2001 lists, but this is more a testament to the horrible state of music today, than a tribute to the, so-called, excellence of &quot;This Is It&quot;.  This being said, &quot;This Is It&quot; is a solid effort and has spent a lot of time in my CD changer since I purchased it.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Hands down one of the year's most solid films.  Stunning performances by both Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connely in a<BR>beautifully directed film. This film not only moves but inspires. Not a dry eye in the house.
6305546789|5.0|The story begins like any other. It is Halloween night and all the kids are out trick or treating. But that is where the  ordinary ends and the terror begins, because this year someone is going to die. It seems that little Michael Myers has developed a thirst for killing and he wacks his sister. Off he goes to the asylum , but luckily for us the system isn't going to let him out, right??? His psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is the only one that can sense the evil that rages in this little boy and he is scared.<br />The story jumps to fifteen years later and guess what holiday is right around the corner....Veteran's Day? No, Halloween. Michael who can't wait to be set free by the system takes his fate into his own hands and escapes. He heads back to  Haddonfield to finish what he started.<br />Flash to Haddonfield. We see that a young blond (&amp; future scream queen) Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) has a little trouble heading her way. Sex, drugs, and Blue Oyster Cult fill the air. Slowly, but surely Michael begins his rampage of killing in search of what, I cannot say (you will have to watch Halloween II to find out that little secret). Poor little Laurie does everything in her power to stop this madman, including stabbing him with knitting needles, poking his eyes out with a hanger, and using his own knife on him. Not even Dr. Loomis can stop him by dumping 6 shots into him. Do we really think the nightmare is over? No, it has only just begun.
0805047905|5.0|Our son can't get enough of this book, and we are happy to oblige. Fun animals, incredible art, good color awareness builder.  It has been with us for about a year and our 2yo son is almost able to 'read' it to us by himself!
0743216458|2.0|I read this book in 3 days, having waited to watch any of the HBO show until I had finished reading the story behind it.  I have yet to watch the show, but I hope it is better than the book.  While I usually enjoy WWII books, this one disappointed me.  The stories set around individual soldiers or small groups were quite good, being told from the stories that Ambrose gathered from those very men.  Where the book falls short is in the description of the major movements of the troops.  His descriptions are confusing and he uses some abbreviations that a person not familiar with the military may be confused by.  Ambrose could have put a little more effort into better explaining these battles.  Adding the maps into the chapters they applied to would also have helped.  Would have like to see more photos also.  It is still a decent read, but disappointed me.
B00005R87Q|1.0|Awful, Awful, Awful. This film could have been great &amp; I thought it would be based on some interesting reviews. But what a joke!<br />The actors(?!) can't act, the script was absolutely terrible..who affects speech like this? So embarassing to hear white people mimic urban black street speech. I cringed! Unintentional rascism? The only intelligent person, or I should say the only character who was portrayed as being intelligent(the computer/engineer geek who of course dies) has a learning disability! WHAT!<br />The cars are the stars of the film. The desire to see the cars is the real lure here.  Not once does the director focus the camera on them and them alone. They missed the whole web of fantasies assosciated with car culture.<br />And the music was so scouse, so low-budget. A wasted oppurtunity on every level.
B00005NTJK|5.0|This review is of the newly remastered 2001 pressing of &quot;Benefit&quot;. Most Tull albums that were issued on Chrysalis the first time around sounded like crap IMO. Not this one. I CANNOT BELIEVE what I have been missing this whole time. I don't need to convince you of how great this album is, that has already been stated in other reviews. Like fine wine and art, this album is one of life's greatest treasures and gifts. If you already own the first pressing on CD, or have never bought this album, buy this CD. This newly remastered version is THAT GOOD. Enjoy!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|After Romeo and Juliet, I was not a big fan of director Baz Luhrmann. However, was always an avid fan of Nicole Kidman. And on Ewan McGregor, I was an agnostic. Now after watching the Moulin Rouge DVD, I am a believer of all three.<br />I won't say that this movie is for everyone. But anyone who likes the theater and opera is sure to like this movie. Excellent scenary (although not real). Excellent tunes. Nicole sings almost as well as she looks! McGregor sings much better than he looks. If you saw the movie, you know what I'm talking about. But the DVD is worth the purchase. Extra clips, footage, documentaries, and &quot;stuffs&quot; to keep you busy for days.<br />Come what may? Own this DVD and you won't be disappointed.
B00005MAM2|5.0|You all know this film I'm sure, but this DVD version finally gives us a cleaned up close to Japanese theatrial release experiance.<BR>The Big complant people have about this DVD was that it didn't have the original english Dub. Trust me don't complain, i imported this DVD as i am a massive Japanese animation fan (especially with the big budget ones like this) and wanted the tin case and all that, but not long ago i also bought the local Australian (local for me) release of the DVD as i noticed it had all three audio tracks on a single DVD. <BR>Now i think i watched about 30mins of the original dub until i decided i remembered it to be better than it actually was. Now whenever i watch it, i always watch it in Japanese, overall everyones voices are better, especially Tetsuo's, who in Japanese truly sounds emotionally erratic and at times psycotic, it also gives the film a truer feel as it is the original language of the film.<br />A well earnt 5 stars. Everyone must see this film, especially now that this DVD has arrived to show it in its true form.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I love this movie!   Strictly Ballroom is just the right blend of humor, some drama and of course dancing.   I also enjoyed the movie soundtrack.  This is the movie that really highlights Baz Luhrmanns' abilities as a director/producer not Moulin Rouge.  Strictly Ballroom is worth watching, (but, you will end up wanting to watch it more than once).
B00005RFQ5|1.0|Or you'll regret it.  He's dabbled with spirituality in his music for over twenty years, but this pseudo-enlightenment babble is dreadful.  Banished Ones? Rise up, rainbow children?  Sorry, no.  The sound is a little more confused -- granted, it's certainly more original than the old work on the Vault and Crystal Ball -- but it's primarily enjoyed only if you're a wide-eyed postmodernist.  I've been a fan forever (I even like Lovesexy, and loved the movie UTCM) . . . and dislike the pop trash we have now.  You want funky?  Go elsewhere.  You loved Leonard Nimoy's folk album?  Then you may appreciate the bizarre enough to like this CD.
B000002LCU|5.0|this is one of his best CDs since All Things Must Pass. I like the following songs,<br />Cloud Nine<BR>That's What it Takes<BR>Devils Radio<BR>When We Was Fab<BR>Got my Mind Set On You.<br />Most of the songs are dancable and full of fun. I think that he rediscovered just how much fun making music really is. His all time best...
B000002B7M|5.0|I was not an Ozzy Osbourne fan until this album. It features phenomenal heavy metal standards such as Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley, the dark,controversial Suicide Solution, The touching ballad Goodbye to Romance, the beautiful epic Mother Earth (Revelation), and I don't know (the rest isn't bad but not classic). Though the real star on this album isn't the Ozz,it's the one and only phenemonal Randy Rhoads. Man what a guitarist, mixing metal and classic. It is insane and sick that any one could play as well or fast as him. RIP to my favorite guitarist, it's too bad that he only lived to do one more album.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When I saw this movie in the cinema I did not know what to think. The first half of the movie was just chaotic mixture of the past and the presence, but than it started to have a real action. The performance of Nicole Kidman is just excelent. This movie takes you out of reality to a different world of sadness, love and kitsch. It is a worth to see this movie, just to forget all daily problems, sit down and listen to the beautiful songs.
6305428557|5.0|Funny stuff - this movie is hilarious!  Initially, I only wanted to gawk at Hugh Grant but I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.  I just could not stop laughing at the antics of the townspeople!  As with all English flicks - the humor is subtle and constant.  Enjoy!
B000001EXR|5.0|In the mid '90s, shortly before the original members reunited for a very profitable nostalgia tour, Kiss made one of the boldest moves of its career. They shed their cartoonish personas, dropped their trademark pop metal, and opted for the harder metal of the day. In the end Kiss the grunge band is as impressive and then some than their best party rock. (With some exceptions) We see deeper songwring that dig deep into the darker side Kiss; from the story of a best friend's suicide (Childhood's End) to an ode to one's son (I Will Be There, a ballad that though great sounds very out of place on this collection of hard rockers) to proclaiming that the &quot;preachers rape the needy&quot; (It Never Goes Away) to screaming that the &quot;Master and the slave will rule us to our grave&quot; (Master &amp; Slave, the best song on the album). These are not the typical topics of Kiss song are they?<br />Most important of all as unlikely as it may seems this never sounds forced. The music is sludgy and raw the anger is real, making them sound like veterans of the Seattle grunge sound. This is also some of Kiss's best instrumentation, and much of the credit belongs to Bruce Kulick on his final album with Kiss. To add to all there are very few Kiss albums that were better produced. (Much thanks to Toby Wright) Essential cuts; Hate, Rain, Master &amp; Slave, Childhood's End, Jungle, In the Mirror, I Walk Alone, the last of which contains the only Bruce Kulick lead vocal in his Kiss tenure.<br />In conclusion this is Kiss at its most creative, lyrically and musically. This is without a doubt Kiss's heaviest and darkest album, and certainly its best studio album. If you were to buy one Kiss album buy Alive! If you were to buy two buy Alive! and Carnival of Souls! And if you wish only to buy those two Kiss albums than buy them NOW!
B000002L75|4.0|Depeche Mode solidified synth pop as the other way to express unhappiness in the 80's if you didn't have the anger to go punk.  With Vince Clarke and &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot; out of the way, it was time for more mature songwriting.<br />Martin Gore stretched his creative muscles in the variety of the songs on &quot;Reward.&quot;  He's also a better singer than David Gahan.  It's easiest just to itemize how they sound; I'll quit trying to be Kurt Loder.<br />*Something To Do - upbeat, danceable working-class lament<BR>*Lie To Me - mid-tempo love song for cynics<BR>*People Are People - danceable, overplayed peace anthem<BR>*It Doesn't Matter - no beat; &quot;I know somewhere / you are<BR>                     dreaming / though it's definitely not of me&quot;<BR>*Stories of Old - mid-tempo filler<BR>*Somebody - haunting piano and voice; a self-loathing lonely<BR>            heart<BR>*Master and Servant - good dance song; as close as DM ever<BR>                      got to being &quot;bad boys&quot;<BR>*If You Want - the other filler track; interesting vocal <BR>               melody<BR>*Blasphemous Rumours - deceptively easy on the ears; a <BR>                       chilling tale of a young life lost<br />&quot;Blasphemous Rumours&quot; slips the knife in gently like The Smiths often did.  The &quot;last breath&quot; ending makes my blood run cold every time. <br />&quot;Some Great Reward&quot; is a must-have if you're a fan.  It's a good warm-up to the darker, more critically praised &quot;Black Celebration.&quot;
B000001FOL|5.0|Okay, its a sad fact that most people in this world are not musically knowledgable or appreciative on a deep level.  This is illustrated by the fact that, as reviewers have noted before, not nearly enough people have ever heard of Nico.<BR>I will state this very plainly:<BR>This album is the classic Nico album.  It also contains the single most beautiful set of songs I have ever heard in my life. And this comes from someone who prides themself on having a broad and obscure musical taste.  There is a certain Zen in this album that I just can't express. Especially on the understated &quot;These Days&quot;. This song gives you the feeling that Nico is singing to you the exhausted lament of someone who has come back from the dead. Its haunting and priceless. As for Nico's voice being unusual, I would have to protest.  People devour the albums of artists like Bjork and PJ Harvey, and to me their voices have a much more unnatural tonal quality.<BR>I urge you to at least listen to this album.  I know the Royal Tenenbaums really got Nico's music back out there, so I hope a lot of people can share in this rare experience.
B000002AZ8|5.0|For some reason every has always considered Pearl Jam Grunge. Well guess what they're not. They were much to straight-egded and commercial sounding to be grunge, but since they were from Seattle every labeled them grunge. But if Pearl Jam ever did have a grunge album, this would be it. This album has much more of a raw, garage band, &quot;grungy&quot; sound to it. And on this album they actually play power chords.  Some awesome grungy songs on Vitalogy are Spin the Black Circle, Whipping, Satan's Bed, Corduroy(One of Pearl Jam's best songs), and Last Exit(great opener).It has some great slow songs too like Nothingman, Betterman, and Immortality. It also has some awesome wierd psychidelic tracks like Tremor Christ; which is perhaps the best song on this album and Pearl Jam's best song; and Pry, To; a wierd short one that you'll get addicted too. Then there is also Not For You, which does not keep a steady boring riff throughout the whole song despite of what some of these reviews have said; it develops into a great normal pearl jam sounding song. Then there is Bugs, some wierd but cool accordian thing with great lyrics and Aye Davanita, another sort of psychidelicish song but without lyrics, still good though. The only song I wasn't impressed with was the last track; it is just a long and annoying noisy mess that never really develops into anything the least bit musical.  If you're going to buy this cd, don't expect it to sound like any of their early 90s commercial stuff or the no code/yield/binaural stuff. This is what Pearl Jam sounded like at the crossroads of their two major eras. When buying this album you don't just get a great Pearl Jam album but a great Grunge album.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Despite some really good films that came out late in the year (Lord of the Rings, Gosford Park), this tops my list for 2001.<br />John Cameron Mitchell has created a character that is fascinatingly complex and bizarre.  It's impossible not to get swept up in the story.  Stephen Trask has written songs that rock at one point, and turn touchingly poignant the next.  Mix in a lot of wild costumes and witty one-liners, and you've got an amazing film.<br />Funny, touching, impossible to get out of your head - all the marks of a wonderful movie!
0425180638|4.0|I love Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  I always enjoy them and hate to see them end. This one showed Kay in a more vulnerable light than in the past. However, it made sense as you could see several different stories coming together in this one. I am looking forward to the next one which will probably have Kay starting out in a new direction.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes her novels.
6304836619|5.0|This movie, pure theater in celluloid, is really a masterpiece. If I could save only ten films to see the rest of my life, Sleuth will be one of them. Its extraordinary how Olivier and Caine play their roles in this embroidered, strange, peculiar and unbeatable script. A rare jewel. Dont think twice: buy and see this film and do word of mouth with your friends... spread the buzz. Theres nothing like this, nor even remotely.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Shakira's first English-language album was, in my opinion, very good for her fisrt try- especially since she had just learned the language. The songs may be lacking some of the poetry and I don't know, essence (?) that she's so good at, but what can you expect with it being her first time writing in English? I loved almost all the songs on the CD other than &quot;The One&quot; (which I just couldn't feel the beat or the words)and &quot;Que Me Quedes Tu&quot; (That one went to slow and there wasn't enough singing). The rest were really cool songs, especially &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot;- that one is my favorite song on the album (of course, the Spanish version is better. The Spanish versions are always better.) Well, anyway, I LOVE this CD. I think it's great that Shakira has been able to step out and make it into the ever close-minded American music industry. Keep up te good work, girl! Tu eres la mejor!
1565847032|5.0|This book is aptly titled. It is, indeed, indispensable as a guide to Noam Chomsky's prolific work as an activist writer/speaker, spanning four decades and innumerable topics. Chomsky is often at his best in talks, Q &amp; A sessions and impromptu answers to interviewers. This is how one should like to be introduced to Chomsky's vast political work. But previous books of interviews, however laudable for their readability, are equally damnable for the absence of references. Where did Chomsky read that comment by such-and-such an official? How do I know he's not making it up? Such questions occur rightly to most people upon their first encounter with someone presenting a view of the social world as unorthodox as Chomsky's. And the interview format provides no answers. The editors of this volume have found an ingenious solution. They have produced a Chomsky reader that is quite unlike a reader -- it consists mostly of transcribed exchanges with audiences at teach-ins and seminar-type discussions -- yet offers notes and references as extensive as -- indeed, more extensive than -- any of the books Chomsky himself has written.<br />Chomsky has spoken of the need for &quot;primers in intellectual self-defense&quot;. This book, I think, could serve that purpose very well.
630463949X|5.0|The production is unbelieveable for a group that has not really played together much lately.  Lindsey Buckingham gives it his all. He is a tremendous talent but all the members make a good contribution to the DVD.  It is one to have. Like a lotof music DVD's, the music is slightly out of sync with the video, i.e. the mouths move and a split second later you hear singing. Guitar riffs are just a little uncoordinated with their sound.<BR>Same issue on Steely Dan's Two Against Nature. Sound and performance on both is stellar.
B000059WOD|5.0|What can I say?  This CD is the perfect mix of all music.  Personally I hate rap, but I like the Linkin Park rap for some odd reason...  I hate Metal, but I like the whole CD which has close to Metal music on all tracks.  Usually I don't like slower songs like &quot;My December&quot;, but its one of my favorites on the CD. Linkin Park has a very special gift for music, and lets hope they don't screw it up by starting to sound like Limp Bizkit and other groups that swear way too much.
0060977493|5.0|Arundhati Roy introduces us here into Indian society in Bombay. It is a marvellous love story between a Touchable woman and an Untouchable man. The story is very moving and very convincing. It is brought to us mainly through the eyes of the two twins of the main character. She is a divorcee and she raises her kids in her family which owns a pickle factory. The two kids, a boy and a girl, make us discover this world with naive eyes and also with a lot of double-thinking. They think and speak in two languages and these two languages are mixed in a very agreeable way. But they also think in two different ways because they are from two eggs and yet twins, one and yet double. But they also think double because their best friend is an Untouchable and this is the cause of the drama. This Untouchable has been favored by the family but there are limits to their favor. Then, when this limit is trespassed, the whole society and everyone becomes ugly, brutal, immoral, unbearable, even the kids are blackmailed by their aunt into accusing the dead Untouchable of having kidnapped them, to save, so the aunt says, their mother. This leaves a bitter taste and shows how urgent it is for this society to find a way to move away from this feudal tradition. It also shows how it is an important slogan for the dominant communist party, even if it is only a slogan.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B00003CXDZ|1.0|Like Titanic, this was a movie that I intented to enter my grave having never seen.  Unfortunately I ended up watching it.<br />That's two hours of my life I want back.<br />This movie is the most disjointed piece of trash I have ever seen.  The cinematography alone is enough to make me hate it, but add to that the plot that seemed to have been created while the writer was on some sort of illegal substance[...].P>I'll admit that the costumes and sets were great.  Fine.<br />But everything else was so bad that it made up for it.  I can't see how anyone likes this movie, or how anyone would be proud to have been in it.  I just kept expecting that it would get better, but it never did.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Mr. Dylan's latest recording is a testament to his long career as a musician.  We should feel lucky that Love and Theft was put to disk, packaged, and distributed in today's world where popular music is decaying into electro-nonsense, which is used more as a backdrop for some model to dance to writhing and lip-syncing than for artistic merit.  Dylan has come a long way in forty years.  He isn't the folk/protest singer, the psychedelic iconoclast, the country crooner, the crusader, the born-again Christian or drugged out forty-something.  He is a chronicler and reinterpreter of traditional American music. Love and Theft speaks to the decades the man has spent absorbing the entire range of traditional music that is our heritage.  <br />The tracks have an earthy honest feel, and one doesn't hear over dubbing or computer manipulation on this album.  The band is on display here; they romp superbly through all the classic styles weaving together banjo, slide-guitars, piano, organ, fiddle, accordion, and drums into a highly textured masterpiece.  Each song has a distinct personality but the album as a whole has unity, a sense of time and place.  The music is of back porches and delta floods, the lyrics convey images of old men fishing for bullheads and reckless youths roaring across the country in mustangs.  I believe that Dylan is looking back on the last century, a hundred years that saw a great musical explosion, a melding and flourishing of new musical creations that gave rise to the many distinct styles today, and paying homage.  There is no popular musician today who dares to go where Dylan has courageously gone.  <br />The music speaks for itself, and is Dylan's new personality-the old traveling blues man.  The album deserves a place on any music lover's shelf.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Every Pythonite should own this DVD, I don't care if you don't even own a DVD player; just buy it and watch it at a friend's house. Countless hours of one's life can be wasted on this single purchase alone. Not that it's a bad thing.<br />I dare anyone to find the newly added 24 seconds of film!! It'll take you at least that many times watching it through to find it. This set is loaded with awesome special features and anyone remotely interested in Python will enjoy them to the fullest.<br />Lastly, I read the first review and I have no idea what the glitches are because I've yet to encounter any. Everything ran smoothly, and just being able to repeatedly watch your favorite Holy Grail scene without constantly rewinding/fast-forwarding deserves to be in everyone's DVD collection!!
0393312836|5.0|I thought that this was an excellent book and would recommend it to anyone. From the beginning I could not put this book down because I got really wrapped up in Alex's character.  His character really reminded me of (in an exaggerated way) a lot of modern youth.  Obsessed with violence and not caring what happened to other people, so involved in himself/themselvs he didn't even care he was hurting the people who cared for him like his parents and even his \\"droogs\\".  I think the message in this book is that no matter what happens that people will always eventually grow up and that even people who might seem happy still have dreams that could make them really happy and not just seem happy on the outside.  But as we mature we realize what is making us happy might not be what we need in life so we change our ways and look forward to a better tomorrow.
B000051S44|5.0|If you love endurance racing, this movie is for you. You will love the sound of McQueen heel-toe rev-matching his Porsche as he enters Le Mans front straight, and the Ferrari just screams.<br />I like this movie because it concentrates on what I really bought it for; the cars. I didn't buy it for McQueen's mug, or their plot line. I bought it to drool over the cars. It's kind of the same way I watch &quot;Ronin&quot; for the car chases.<br />I just wish they would release this on DVD. I would love to crank this on a DTS or Dolby system and listen to the cars scream by.<br />If you love the cars, buy it. If you're looking for a good plot, move along.
0385505833|5.0|This book is such fun.  It is not typically Grisham but rather a satirical,easy read. Poking fun at the commercialism of Christmas, the author brings out thoughts and feelings we have all had around the holidays. With classic comedic satire, Grisham points out how we have let the trappings of the holiday overide the true meaning of this most important Christian celebration. This is the perfect time of year to read this novel. By January or February, I am ready to read something light and humorous. And of course, the true meaning of Christmas always prevails.  Enough said.  I don't want to give anything away. READ THIS BOOK.  You will enjoy it.
B00005Q66T|5.0|I really don't know what to say about this album except that every song is excellent!  This could be the greatest compilation album (other than Immaculate Collection).<BR>I don't think I could choose a favourite song from this album - there's too many good ones!  But my favourites would have to be: - <BR>1) Deeper &amp; Deeper -<BR>    For making me get up &amp; dance everytime it's on.<BR>2) Beautiful Stranger -<BR>    Because it has great lyrics and it's very dancey.<BR>3) Don't Cry For Me Argentina -<BR>    Because it is an absolutely beautiful song, sung perfectly by       Madonna.
B00003CXSM|1.0|This movie was so boring and predictable.  Jennifer Lopez wasn't bad at all, but Italian - not bloody likely.  They should have done a Latino family it would have helped.
B000002KFJ|5.0|To say that this is the most underrated album in Black Sabbath's catalouge would be an understatement. While Paranoid, Master of Reality, and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath get all of the attention (for good reason, too) Sabatoge remains lumped in with their later, more lackluster efforts (just check out the ponderous riffage on most of Never Say Die), which is a big mistake. <BR>Although there is a significant amount of synth-driven songs here, they do not detract from either the writing or the power of the tunes. Almost all of the songs here are forgotten classics: Hole in the Sky (sung with extreme desperation by Ozzy), the very heavy Symptom of the Universe, the catchy Am I Going Insane, and the intense, haunting, and angry last song, titled The Writ.<BR>Iommi comes up with a lot of impressive riffs, which are competently backed by Butler and Ward's rhythm section and Ozzy's wailing vocals. Overall, I would say that it falls a bit short of Paranoid,Master of Reality, and Vol. 4,but on par with Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and the self-title. It's also worlds beyond Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die, as well as all the post-Ozzy material. So if you're a Sabbath fan, go out and buy it-you wont be disappointed.
B00004U60I|5.0|My 10 month old loves this DVD!!  Not only does it expose her to the world of classical music...but it can keep her attention for the entire length of the video.  She loves to listen to the &quot;play time&quot; section during the day...and mommy and daddy love the &quot;bedtime&quot; music in the evening.  My daughter knows when the opening credits come on the TV that her video is getting ready to play and she will stop whatever she's doing and stand in front of the TV to watch (or when the jammies are on she wants to sit in our lap for snuggle time).  A must have for any parent!  I've already started shopping for other videos from Baby Einstein.
B00005RHGK|5.0|It scared me, I almost didn't want to finish watching it!  But, I did.  Although the \\"bad guy\\" was a little stupid...you can't beat the plot, the characters and definately not THE ENDING!!!!<br />It's a great flick and well worth the [price].
B00005R87Q|1.0|First of all, don't expect any kind of realism from this movie.  I was dumbfounded when the main characters FLOORBOARDS came out of his passenger side when he used his nitrous boost.  Next scene he picks up someone who was running from the cops, no problem.  <br />Each of the &quot;underground street races&quot; have about 10,000 to 20,000 spectators (you can see them flying by the whole time, even when the speedo is reading 160mph... yeah sure), and yet none of them get caught by the cops when they do finally show up (after the race is over, of course).  <br />Honestly, I stopped this movie before it was over.  The acting in the movie is terrible, and the cars were little more than import tuners with a bunch of plastic ground effects and lowered suspension.  The story has been done time and time again, if you want to see an underground cop movie, at least watch one of the originals in this cheesy genre like Point Break, or Terminal Velocity.<br />Do yourself a favor, use your time for something more desireable, like getting your teeth drilled at the dentist.
B00005QC5D|4.0|My opinion for the soundtrack is well, I think it's okay. I mean I have favorites like #1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,14,18 and 19. But some of the songs are really boring. I was waiting for the soundtrack ever since I watched the movie. But out of all the songs I said I like,I really like #1 and 19. So out of all the Harry Potter fans out there,I would like to say,GET THE SOUNDTRACK!                                                       -Lisandra
B000000OMJ|5.0|On Peter Gabriel's third consecutive self-titled album, he finally perfected all the many moods he had tried to capture with his previous work in Genesis and on his own.  The album is experimental in sound, full of  challenging and thought provoking lyrics and innovative musicianship.  &quot;Intruder&quot;  is a strong opener to the album and a great song, but the standout is the brilliant &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot;.  Quirky in sound and socially conscious in content, the song is cutting and edge, yet completely accessible and radio friendly.  Other great songs include the aurally mystic tale of the South African civil rights leader &quot;Biko&quot;, the high charged &quot;I Don't Remember&quot; and the poignant &quot;Family Snapshot&quot;.
B00005U8EM|4.0|The movie is about a tv reporter(B.Murray) who lives literally the same day over and over again. Finally at the end, he finds his way out of it(with the love of A.MacDowell). I definitely suggest everyone to see it, it is an enjoyable movie.
B0000019PA|5.0|Let's pretend, for a moment, that you're listening to Aeroplane for the first time, having heard nothing at all from this alternately praised and despised album.  The first thing to notice is the faintly catchy acoustic strumming of &quot;King of Carrot Flowers, part 1&quot;.  In bursts a slightly nasal voice that was never intended to sing, an odd accompanying wind or brass instrument that strangely matches it, and nonsensical lyrics reminiscent of Syd Barrett but with more sex.  Just when you're getting used to this little piece of quirk, Part 2 begins, and a lo-fi electric guitar begins arpeggiating uncertainly.  The voice is back, and this time it's nigh-excruciating as singer Jeff Mangum belts out &quot;IIILooooooovveYYOOOOOOOOOUUUUJEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESUSCHRIIIIIIISSSSTT&quot; in a register far above his capacity.  At this point, the listener either runs screaming, never to touch the album again, or (and this is the path you follow) s/he &quot;gets the joke&quot; and bursts into fits of laughter; Mangum sure has balls.  Aeroplane gets mentally filed into the &quot;Novelty&quot; section.<br />No sooner do you dismiss this act as a good joke than Neutral Milk Hotel shatters the conception by bursting into the dreadfully catchy and piledriving near-punk of Part 3.  As a plethora of sounds and instruments clank and whirr along, the band reveals its ace in the hole, a brass band that brings even more of a mad, carnivalesque tenor to the song.  Maybe this band can rock after all, you think, however weirdly.  Could they possibly be _serious_?<br />The final piece to the puzzle comes with the next two songs.  The affecting (and affected) &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; is quite possibly the finest piece of music ever recorded involving a musical saw(three-part saw harmonies, no less!), and the surreal lyrics finally coalesce into a theme, as fine a musical take on &quot;carpe diem&quot; as I remember in rock.  By the time Two-Headed Boy Part I rolls around, thesongwriting's become almost unbearably good, the singing's become almost unbearably strained, and the instruments have just gone nuts.  The sense of yearning is palpable, but something odd's going on.  Sure, there's the acoustic guitar being played as violently as in any punk song, but is that the brass band shifting into a New Orleans funeral march?  Indeed!<br />The remainder of the album is a kaleidoscope of oddity, pain, love, young sex, Anne Frank, flowers, flames, spines, and death.  Rather than being any one of the the things suggested in the previous paragraphs, Neutral Milk Hotel is ALL of them.  Mangum is joking lightly and deadly serious, celebratory and mournful, mad and sane, sober and wild.  Illustrating the contradiction are the songs that can make me cry even though I couldn't understand the lyrics if my life depended on it.  This album encompasses it all, and just when it all seems like it's going to fly apart, the tortured conviction of Mangum's voice and the utter catchiness of the music win out.  _Aeroplane...&quot; is a terrific album if you're willing to accept it on its own terms, and I pity anyone who misses out on it; in all the flailing weirdness, it somehow becomes universal.  <br />PS:  The voice becomes incredibly endearing after enough listens.

B00004T8RK|3.0|Well these Granddads of Grunge are still putting out better music than most today.  Its better than all that pop or over-produced rock like Creed or Kid Rock.  Not as inspired as some of their earlier stuff, but good listening.
B00004Z311|5.0|This movie is not about dazzling you with special effects,<BR>or finding the right teeny bopper actor to play a million dollar<BR>roll.  This movie is all about what most good books and movies are, a great escape from our everyday lives.  And what an escape it was!  To venture through merky forests and talk among elves, to follow a fairies guidance and to conquere the darkness that exists within us all.<br />   Sadly, Ridley Scott is slowly developing this directors cut.  It contains so much that was taken away from the original film, plus includes the music that it was meant to have, not the Tangerine Dream score.<br />   Though derived from several scripts, one of which was under the original title called &quot;Legend Of Darkness,&quot; a much darker and violent portrayal of good versus evil, I think that the film ultimatley manages to reach the child-like wonder in us all.<br />   If you haven't already bought this movie, do so immediatley!!!
0345451325|5.0|I am an avid gamer myself, not many games can really intrigue me. I played the game Halo the plot-line from the beggining is difficult to comprehend. I played through all the missions had fun, exept for the concrete storyline the game in almost all aspects perfect. I was looking for a much more in-depth view of the game. When i came across The Fall of Reach i read the book learned how everything happened how The Covenant came to be and who Master Cheif really was. I believe that Eric Nylund did a very good job in making this book. He put interesting twists and turns in it. All in all i would give this book a 10/10 for anyone who likes to play Sci-Fi first person shooter games, or anyone whos just bored.
B00005RJ1U|1.0|This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen.  It starts out with so much promise and then just leaves you wishing that the demon would leap through your tv screen and kill you so you don't have to finish watching it!!  It almost seems like someone took two different movies and spliced them together to form one big pathetic, confusing mess.  The first half of the movie portrays the bad guy as a royally messed up, yet intelligent individual...who turns into a flying, drooling excuse for a villain by the end of the movie.  How are we supposed to believe that this slobbering, dirty under-sniffing bat-thing was responsible for the intricate mosaic of dead bodies seen in an earlier scene?  Who is &quot;the creeper&quot; and why does he kill only every 23 years?  We'll never know.  And what is the significance of the recurring song?  He doesn't steal everyone's eyes...it makes no sense.  But I guess not making sense is the only thing this film accomplished successfully!!  I hope to God they don't make a sequel to this sorry excuse for a film...there is no way they can salvage this cinematic train wreck.
B00005QG9J|2.0|This album is not all that great.My favorite track on this albu mis the only track that they made a video for.This album isn't worth buying.I was very suprised about this album sucking so much.

B000002JKA|5.0|songs like caught in a web, the mirror, and lie are enough reason to buy this album. i liked these 3 mainly because i'm mostly a heavy metal guy. anyway it's a great album so buy it.

I think this movie is great to buy.
6302256704|3.0|I enjoyed this movie it had some funny gags and jokes but some of the gags and jokes worked and some didn't and it isn't as funny as Airplane or Naked Gun but I really like Charlie Sheen he was very good in this movie. I would recommend that people rent this first before deciding if they want to buy it unless they have already seen it and really like it enough to add to their collection.
0060012331|5.0|On the Discworld, even wizards produce leftovers.  Their discarded garbage, however, is laced with traces of magic.  Out on the tip, the rats forage in the scraps - apple cores, candle stubs [good carbohydrate source], dogends.  Like any trace mineral, the magic builds up until the rats have changed, gaining new talents.  Among those talents are speaking and reading.  Speaking allows them to communicate better while the reading gives them words to use as names.  They're an organized group now, and they have an ambition.  They want to find a safe place for retirement.  They have a mentor, Maurice, a cat who shares their talents, but has an extra one of his own - he's a con cat.  And he has a story hidden away.<br />A street smart feline, Maurice has learned the value of money.  He knows how humans use it, and he wants the independence it offers.  To gain it, he's organized the rats and adopted Keith, a rather simple human, into his group.  Together, they work the towns to create a &quot;plague of rats&quot; then provide a piper, Keith, to lure them away - for cash.  Despite disputes over percentages, the team has scored many successful ventures.  But Keith, and the rats, are having misgivings over the ethics of the con.  They want to quit, and Bad Blintz will be the last place they work the con.<br />Every venture has its risks.  Bad Blintz is clearly not a rich place.  The villagers queue up for bread and sausages, which are in short supply.  There are rat catchers who carry strings of tails, but the team can't find a live rat anywhere in the maze of cellars and tunnels beneath the town.  In resolving this conundrum, team encounters a powerful new force - one that challenges all the skills given them by the wizards' residue magic.  Their very survival rests on how they deal with the mystery.  Its resolution is consummately Pratchett.<br />Terry Pratchett's books increasingly delve into philosophical questions, even moral ones.  It would be nice to know if he actually intended this book for &quot;children.&quot;  You'll note above that the publishers call for &quot;Reader Level Ages 9 - 12,&quot; but the editorial reviews say &quot;12 and up.&quot;  The disparity is typical Pratchett.  Why the lack of consensus?  One guess is that Pratchett thinks the adult mind set is too rigid to discern the point he's making.  This book isn't a fantasy about &quot;talking animals,&quot; it's a spur to stimulate thinking about the relationship of humanity to the rest of the animal kingdom.  We're part of that kingdom, but we deal with our relations in ignorance.  Children, and a few adults, are best suited to begin revising that approach.  With human society devastating the habitats of so many creatures, a new way of thinking about them is required.  Pratchett's conclusion shows that the process won't be simple and we have to start thinking now about how to do it.  Who better to start with than children?  They still have the capacity to learn.<br />It's almost superfluous to discuss Pratchett's writing.  He's a master of language and a skilled manipulater of ideas.  If you are new to his work, this is a fine place to start.  If you're an established fan, there's nothing here to disappoint you.  Add this book to your library and buy another for someone.  Anyone.  They'll surely be grateful.ly intended this book for &quot;children.&quot;  You'll note above that the publishers call for &quot;Reader Level Ages 9 - 12,&quot; but the editorial reviews say &quot;12 and up.&quot;  The disparity is typical Pratchett.

0783240287|5.0|What a hoot!  I was enchanted!  When I brought the dvd home, my husband raised an eyebrow and said &quot;you're going to make me watch THAT?&quot; before turning back to his computer... 15 minutes into the movie, I caught him tapping his feet and whistling along under his breath.  <br />Some of the sexual innuendo had me a little thoughtful, at first, about showing this to my godchildren -- but it's nothing as bad as they see on TV every day, and certainly not enough to make me decide not to show it to them.  <br />Great staging, good choreography, good wardrobe (that had me taking notes, in places, for tribal belly dance costumes).  The cast obviously enjoyed themselves tremendously which made the show that much better.  This one's a keeper!
B000002UAX|5.0|the best rock album of all time period. to match this music you have to go to karajan and the berlin philharmonic playing beethovens ninth. nothing more need be said
B00004U60I|5.0|I have 6 month old twins, boy and girl, and they absolutely LOVE the baby einstein series.  Amongst their favorites are Baby Bach, Baby MOzart, and Baby Dolittle.  My daughter screams with delight at certain parts of the movies.  I highly recommend these tapes.  Sometimes by putting them on, it can free up an hour for me to get things done!  My kids can be screaming, and when I put the tapes on, they suddenly are enchanted by the music and images, and are totally entertained!
B000002JSP|5.0|(I suppose that's one way to describe John Bonham's death)<br />I'm tempted to lower my rating to 4 stars because &quot;Fool In The Rain&quot; and &quot;All My Love&quot; have been overplayed to hell and back on radio... but the truth is that this record is very good and, despite the overexposed shortcomings of those two tracks, the rest is still solid rock by one of the giants of rock.  Note that it's &quot;South Bound Suarez&quot;... the typo will persist forever, but at least you know better now.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is one of the most hilarious DVDs I've Ever seen.  The extra features on this DVD are really great too.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Finally, a DVD worthy of the film. The transfer is beautiful (intense color), DTS sound is awesome, and all the missing bits we've seen in cable documentaries restored, as well as some expanded conversations here and there that really improve the character relations. Very nice extras, including Wyatt's diagram of the OK Corral gunfight. Boothe, Lang &amp; Biehn defend their characters as if they had become Cowboys. Oddly enough, the crucial line omitted from the release print, where Wyatt calls Josephine a nasty epithet to drive her out of Tombstone(to save her life), is still omitted, although his apology and her forgiveness (at the Hooker ranch) are still there. It's actually worth buying Jarre's screenplay to get all the pieces that are missing, even from this version. Nonetheless, this is one of the all-time GREAT DVDs.
B000002LAC|5.0|'Trio' is a great album. These singers are some of the best voices in the world.<br />I don't know that much about country music. And so I don't know if the songs on this album are actually country songs.<BR>But I don't really care. Because the music on 'Trio' is so lovely, it inspires me everytime I listen to it.<br />I would recommend this album to everyone.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I have to say it!  I have never seen anything LIKE this before!  I was told it was good, which, to me, usually means I'm disappointed.  However, this one's a gem!<br />I couldn't wait for the DVD!  The extra's are incredible and I've watched it about 15 times since I bought it - I switch on the DVD to watch one quick song (Roxanne!) and end up watching the whole thing over again.  It's absolutely mindblowing!  LOVE Ewan, LOVE Nicole, hell - Love everybody!<br />Boys who are into their cars, go play with &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; - this one's not for you.  For everybody else, stop hanging around and buy it - you won't be sorry!
6305127689|3.0|While this movie is one of my all time favorites and a must for everybody's DVD library, there are NO special features!  No 'Making of the movie', no 'deleted scenes', no commentary.  How can such a great movie be put on a DVD without any special features?  I'm hoping there will be a re-release of the DVD that will be much better!
B00005JKOV|5.0|This movie was the most visually stimulating work I've seen in a long time.  It is also very funny...  All of the existential art theories explored are done with such comedic finesse that I really couldn't stop giggling with glee.
B000050XEI|3.0|I bought two albums simultaneously, Watermark and A Day Without Rain.  Watermark is by far the superior album, with a better mix of tunes and simply more intersting and varied songs.  Example:  I've listened to A Day Without Rain once, and Watermark five times in the first month since I purchased them both.<br />Besides the cover track, none of the songs really stick out in my mind as being that great.  And the whole album tends to blend together.  I can't recommend this album, though it would make nice background music when one wants to relax.  Musically, nothing sophisticated.
B00005QATY|2.0|I saw the original &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou? in the theatres three times and simply loved it. It was probably my all-time favorite movie --that is, until I bought my own copy and saw how money-hungry, consensus-building editors had ruined this masterpiece. I am a big bluegrass and blues fan and really loved the varied music, and in the original, caught a glipse of the South of my grandparents' time in the picturesque scenery and hilarious spoofs on the bigotry that was an unfortunate reality of the day. The portions that were cut out of the theatre version were the very &quot;glue&quot; that held the story together from beginning to end and what made the corallary with &quot;The Odessey&quot; credible. Worst of all perhaps was the omission of critical scenes that not only destroyed the plot and developed the characters, but defamed the music as well, especially Allison Crouse's solo and subsequent choral crescendo leading up to the baptismal scene. What a sad, sad hack job. It makes me want to weep. And what I wouldn't give for a copy of the unadulterated, unbutchered version!
B00005JKHP|5.0|The original release of ST:TMP was, to say the least, a rush job. Paramount had committed to a release date that had made it impossible to do the film right, and had wasted huge amounts of time and budget with visual effects people who weren't up to the task. Moreover, in the wake of Star Wars, they put far too much emphasis on those visual effects. The 1983 edition was an improvement, tightening up the slow spots while restoring scenes that should never have been cut, but even it left something to be desired, in part because the added material from the abandoned &quot;Memory Wall&quot; sequence created a gaping continuity hole in the &quot;Spock Walk&quot; sequence that had replaced it (namely, Kirk changes from a &quot;work&quot; space suit to an &quot;evacuation&quot; space suit with no explanation).<br />This edition is as much of an improvement over the 1983 version as that one was over the original, partly because the pacing has been refined even further, and partly because the new visual effects finally let us see what the film was intended to look like. It's regrettable that the &quot;Memory Wall&quot; footage of Kirk leaving the ship had to come back out of the &quot;Spock Walk&quot; sequence, but as beautiful as it was, it had created far too jarring of a continuity gap in the 1983 version.
B00003CXXI|5.0|&quot;Shrek&quot; is perhaps the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. What exactly about it makes me tick? Is it the funny &quot;Matrix&quot;-parodying 360 degrees shots? It is that Gingerbread Man scene? Is it the fact that an ugly ogre is the savior of a hot chick? Actually, for me it's that wisecracking Donkey, who, done by Eddie Murphy, is hilarious for his comments. More important, he does his stunts to get a reaction out of Shrek, which creates tension between the characters (let's face it, it took a long time for Shrek to like Donkey). Perhaps it's the rendition of &quot;I'm a Believer.&quot; Whatever, I say. If you watch Shrek, prepare to laugh. Hard. Painfully. But hey, that's more than you can say for TV lately.
0060254920|5.0|My mother purchased this book for me when I was little along with Harry the Dirty Dog and The Happy Egg I fell in love with them both.  Well I have moved several times over the years and managed to damage several books including the ones listed.  Well lets just say that I enjoyed these books enough to search many book stores and online auctions to replace them because the stores are timeless.  I really enjoy Where the Wild Things Are because when I was younger I was afraid of monsters and things that were hidden in the shawdows and this book lets you know that there is a bit of the monster in us all and that there is no reason to be afraid.  I also like the fact that the book shows that when a parent punishes a child it does not mean that there is a loss of love.  I recommend this book to anyone with or without kids and if you like this the other two listed may also be something you will like.  And if you can find a copy of the Happy Egg anywhere grab it along with Happiness Is a Warm Puppy another one of my favorites.  Thanks for reading this and I hope it was helpful.  Also who needs Harry Potter when you have such classics.
B000002UAO|5.0|RUBBER SOUL is one of The Beatles' best albums, if not one of the world's best. There are almost no fillers; the only song that comes close to being considered a waste of space is \\"Wait.\\" This album is packed end-to-end with great music.It retains some of The Beatles' simple, love-song past, while pointing towards a quite psychedelic future. The first sign of that is the thin strains of the sitar in \\"Norwegian Wood.\\" <BR>\\"In My Life\\" talks vaugely about love, if not about only friendship. <BR>\\"Nowhere Man\\" takes us to a new plain as far as Beatles songs go: it isn't about love. <BR>The album has its ups and downs, but it all meshes together to create a truly unique body of work that only The Beatles could create.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I've read many reviews from different sources and I realise that people either love the album to the extreme, or hate it.  Given the fact that I have no exposure to any of her previous albums and therefore without a certain level of expectation to start with, I am hoping to write a fair review on Shakira's new English album.<br />Let's begin by looking at the album from the lyrical point of view.  Many of you may not be able to relate directly to her lyrics but they are personnel and sincere.  It is as though you are reading the diary of part of Shakira's love life.  From someone who has hurt by love, \\"All this pain begins to feel like pleasure, with my tears you'd make a sea of desert, salt my wounds and I'll keep saying thank you\\", to someone who has just fallen in love, \\"So I find a reason to shave my legs each single morning ... so I learned to cook and finally lose my kitchen phobia\\", to someone who has fallen deeply in love, \\"You're a song written by the hands of God ... underneath your clothes there's an endless story\\".<br />I would classify the music itself as fresh, creative and lively - partly because of her Latino root.  All the solo instrumental pieces, be it as a short duration of guitar solo, or percussion, are beautifully blended into the mood of the song, almost to the perfection.  Shakira's singing is unique, versatile, at times moody, but mostly rhythmic.  Together with her music, the singing gives the audiences a new kind of audio experience.  Not before long, the melody will stick into your mind and her singing will make you tap your feet (or your hands when you are driving).  Try not to criticise her pronunciation too much and try to take the whole package as it is and be grateful that the accent is part of the uniqueness of her music.  <br />I disagree the critics who compare Shakira with Alanis.  Alanis's music is not as diverse as Shakira and Alanis's singing is quite terrible.  I also feel a bit hard to relate Shakira with Celine Dion as what the editor's review says.  They are from two different genres.<br />Do check out the album if you are looking for something fresh, something creative, and if you want something different from the commercially engineered products.  Nothing beats the joy of adding another album into your all-time-favourites.
B000002UAR|4.0|REVOLVER is, to put it simly, amazing. Almost perfect. George Harrison's contributions, &quot;Taxman&quot; &quot;Love You To&quot; and &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; are truly from the heart. This is probably the second album in which you can see each Beatle's personal tastes more clearly, the first being &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; released about eight months before this one. John Lennon was more avant-garde and harsh, Paul McCartney, more soft, simple, sane and loving, George Harrison was more spiritual and honest, and Ringo Starr, well....Ringo was just silly! <BR>&quot;Taxman&quot; is a clear rock number. I can see George's point about being angry about taxes. Finally, when you get to actually make money, you have to start giving it away to the government! Paul's &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; is haunting and sort of depressing. But then John brightens things up a bit with &quot;I'm Only Sleeping,&quot; a silly song about, simply not wanting to get out of bed. George tones it down with &quot;Love You To&quot; an obscure song with spiritual lyrics. One of Paul's most loved ballads, &quot;Here There and Everywhere&quot; comes next, followed by the truly classic &quot;Yellow Submarine.&quot; &quot;She Said She Said&quot; is hard and strange, not the album's best. &quot;Good Day Sunshine,&quot; a Paul song, is sweet and simple, singing about loving good weather. &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; is nonsensical, but &quot;For No One&quot; is truly heartbreaking. It almost makes you cry. &quot;Doctor Robert&quot; is upbeat, about a medicine man of some sort, &quot;I Want to Tell You,&quot; earnest, &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot; simple and straightforward, the title explains it all. But then, the final track, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; wakes you up like a bolt of lightning. It is truly weird. <BR>Obscure lyrics, janglings and murmurings, a repetitive, almost hypnotic beat, and John Lennon's flat, monotone voice fills up the album and defines it as the first truly psychedelic body of work. <BR>Over all, the album is a gem, not to be missed.
B00000295A|5.0|now...i'm not just saying this...i own all of their cd's (except synkronized)...and this is the one that i keep coming back to, time after time...tracks 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 are some of their best work....if you like any other jamiroquai albums, you will def. like this one!  what kind of fan doesn't have the album that started it all, anyway?  check this one out...you will NOT be disappointed!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Shuster you are a nerd. why dont you go watch The Sound of Music if or something.  This is a great movie with a very original plot.  This is not a main stream movie created by the same Communists that control Hollywood.  Set back and enjoy it is just a good movie.
0446608955|4.0|After reading Spark's &quot;The Notebook&quot; and &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; I didn't think his books could get much better than that. But when I saw an ad for the movie &quot;A walk to remember&quot; (starring Shane West and Mandy Moore) advertised as being based on a book by Nicholas Sparks I immediatly managed to find a copy even though it had been sold out at all bookstores in my hometown for weeks. <br />I picked it up and managed to read it in a record of 4 hours on and off. I loved the way Sparks developed his characters so they were like the average seventeen year old. Being sixteen it made it really easy for me to relate to the feelings felt by the protaganist, Landon. <br />This book is the perfect gift for any teenager looking for a good read but make sure to curl up by the fire on one of those wintery night and don't forget the tissues!
0743200799|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was especially fun to read this book and then watch the movie &quot;The Dish&quot; as they complement each other quite well!  In addition to the events at Nasa, this also doubles as a semi-biography of Gene Krantz, also interesting, but not what I was expecting!  All in all this is a great read representing a unique period in American history.
B000002LPD|5.0|With For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, Van Halen got more serious after doing a couple of more radio friendly albums.  The CD gets down to business and rocks all the way.  The progressive aspect is there too.  When Sammy came on board with VH he helped take them in new directions.  Hagar is not afraid to try new things and this CD shows it.  Songs like Poundcake, Judgment day and Top of the World ground it in the rock world, but others like Pleasure Dome, In &amp; Out and Man on a Mission delve into different musical flairs.  All in all, this probably the best post David Lee Roth album Van Halen has made.  But make no mistake, even though Dave made some great music with Van Halen, Sammy is still better then Dave.
B00003CXTG|1.0|For aviation and warbird afficianados, the much-anticipated flying scenes are sorely disappointing. The Battle of Britain is inaccurately depicted. Sorry to say (particularly for the Brits), late model Mark V and IX Spitfires (cannon-armed &amp; 4 blade props!) weren't available for the Battle. It's understandable that a low-budget film would have to show late models for &quot;real&quot; ground &amp; taxiing shots, but the computer-generated aerial battles could have at least been rendered with correct models. Here's another...Ben Affleck is shot down &amp; ditches in the Channel where moments before he was in sight of Beachy Head. Goes MIA for weeks? Rescued by a French boat? How long did you tread water Ben? Maybe the Brits didn't want to rescue this one! Here's my vote for editing award of the movie. Look carefully and you'll see the yellow-nosed Bf109 which waxed Ben's fanny viewed from the rear in a hanger at Pearl Harbor! Reverse lend lease? Do you really think Doolittle would draft 2 single-engine flyboys for the Tokyo raid? Bit of an insult to the B25 crews there. Bottom line if you want the aerial view of the Battle of Britain, rent the movie by same name. For Pearl, go with Tora Tora Tora &amp; Finally 30 Seconds Over Tokyo is still the definitive movie on the Doolittle Raid.
B00005QDW1|4.0|And, yup you guessed it..start dining. It may not be consistent, but, has there ever really been a consistent No Doubt album?  I can't say one exists.  The songs may not hit ya on the first listen, but, just suck it up and play it again, it'll get to ya.<BR>When I first heard &quot;Hey Baby&quot; I frowned.  Then, I heard it again...and again...and yes, again, and I still do not see what the all the fuss is about over this song, but, it is certainly fun and enjoyable, just like the rest of the album.  &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; &amp; &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; are my absolute favorites, but, other yummerz include &quot;Hella Good&quot;, &quot;Detective&quot;, and the sweet ballad &quot;Running&quot;.  There are some not-so-yummerz that you wish could've been baked a little more, such as &quot;Start the Fire&quot;, &quot;In My Head&quot;, and &quot;Underneath It All&quot;. Even with the number of familiar faces on the production credits, the album still fails to truly impress. &quot;Making Out&quot; is not William Orbit's best work, and Prince's re-working of &quot;Making Out&quot; allows Gwen to explore her vocal chops, but, still feels as a little incomplete. Even so, it's still hard not to enjoy most of these songs. The only real bummerz (that's just my weird terminology, go along with it) is the title track &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, which plays out the intro into a chorus that gets repeated way too much. Hey, they may be far from being musical rocket scientists, but they're still thrilling.
B00003CXQY|5.0|This is an awesome animated film. I find it hilarious and fresh. Not to mention TOM JONES does the opening song! WOW! It is a true example that Disney is ready for the changing times. This film has some of THE best lines I have heard in a loooonnnnng time!  They are original and get both kids and adults to burst out laughing.  My friends child is about 2 years old.  She doesn't talk a lot because she is VERY shy.  But if anyone points to a character on the cover and says &quot;who's that?&quot;  she pipes up proudly and clearly says their name!  She has even memorized lines in the movie (especially Kronk lines).  I am addicted also.  Granted my husband and I truely appreciate Disney art and animation.  So, maybe I am a little biast to begin with.  But this is no ordinary Disney movie.  Many Disney loyalists have booed this film.  It really is a departure from the Disney norm.  That, said I can recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor.  Just a few heads up: #1.  This is not a musical, appreciate it for what it is and don't expect them to break into song at any moment!  #2.  The humor is not usual Disney. It is very corny, and adult (I don't mean sex, violence, etc.) but kids can really get into it.  There is also a lot of Physical humor, bouncing, tripping, crazy walking, etc. #3.  Other reviewers have noted that the Special Edition DVD is not worth the extra $ because there really isn't any extra stuff, WRONG!  These are people who obviosly have no interest in the research, development, and art of making a Disney animated feature.  As such they should have read what was included, realized that it would mean nothing to them and purchased the regular edition.  As for my family (I repeat, we are animation and Disney fans) this was a real treat.  It is very interesting. So decide which side of the fence you are on and make the smart choice.  I close with a list of my favorite lines from my favorite characters:<BR>Kuzco - &quot;No Touchy&quot;<BR>Pacha - &quot;No Kuzco, No Kuzcotopia&quot;<BR>Yzma - Not so much a line but when she is trying to get rid of Kuzco. Yzma and Kuzco are at the dinner table. Kronk is serving. She is trying to tell Kronk to hit him on the head but he just ain't gettin' it.  So she has a brocolli in each hand and is repeatedly hitting one brocolli with the other.  Under her breathe and out of the corner of her mouth she says &quot;(h)it (h)im on the (h)ead.&quot;<BR>Kronk - (talking to a squirrel)&quot;Squeek Squeekety Squeeker&quot; (and many others!)<br />Old man in opening - &quot;Beware the Groove!&quot;
0316777722|1.0|I know Sedaris from his work at NPR.  On radio he can be funny, but reading about his empty and sad life was depressing.  <br />Sedaris'claim that meth harms no one was offensive and flat out wrong.  Meth has absolutely devastated many individuals, families, and small towns in the Western USA.  Meth labs are also an environmental disaster with toxic chemicals being dumped into landfills all over the West.
0812550706|5.0|When you finish the book, you are left with an empty feeling that it's over, and you want to turn back to page one and start all over again.<br />Ender Wiggin is one of the best characters I've ever read about. Card creates some of the most beleivable characters in this story, and has a great understanding of human behavior.<br />Although the best part about this novel is that from start to finish, there is not one page that lags the story, it's a constant go-go-go pace. You will not be able to put it down once you start. This book is simply beautiful.
B00005LC1H|5.0|This series is the funniest TV I've ever seen!  My wife generally doesn't get Brit humor.  She walks away puzzled over how I could find Python funny.  <br />Fawlty Towers is something else entirely.  I made her watch once and she became an instant believer.  Between the clever running jokes and John Cleese's brilliant physical humor, I still find myself gasping for breath between belly laughs even after seeing these episodes for the thousanth time.
B00000420F|5.0|As a performing operatic tenor, I well know the difficulties of maintaing line and expressing subtle nuance associated with this period of music, but Cecilia does a fantastic job on both accounts!  What purity of tone and clarity of thought she presents.  For those students of voice, this is a recording which can properly introduce, in a simple and unadorned way, the basics of line, phrase, breath, and musicality; a fantastic addition to one's musical library.
068484267X|4.0|Another one of those recent books which has to compared with the movie. As ever the book wins hands down. Not a light read but enjoyable none the less.<br />It is the writers memoirs of a poor upbringing mainly in Limerick. Does it really rain there contantly? The downstairs of the family is permanently flooded. The loss of siblings is described in a matter of fact way which emphasises its inevitability. <br />It is not all gloom. There are moments of real humour - particularly the first communion where 'The Lord Jesus' becomes stuck in his throat and is subsequently vomited into the back-yard. <br />As this is a memoir it is unclear how much is historically accurate. but it isn't a history book.<br />I would have given it 5 stars but it was depressing in places. Hardly a reasonable criticism.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Ok to start off being a big Britney fan this CD in a way was a big change for her! ritney experiemanted with new producers new beats and new concepts for the songs. Although in some of the tracksit is obvious she is sticking to her Pop roots as to not alianate her younger fans, but she is definately trying to keep her original fans who are growing up. Here's a breakdown of each song.<br />1) I'm A Slave 4 U - This song is definately a change and shows our little Britney is growing up. When I first heard the song I thought this is NOT the same Britney. The song combines some urban beats with tons of sound FXs. Great song awesome lyrics.<BR>2) Overprotected - Personally my favorite song on the CD. Basically Britney talks about how she is the ruler of her destiny and she is gonna do things her way. She says &quot;Say Hello to the girl that I am&quot; and &quot;I'm so fed up with people tellin' me to be, someone else but me!&quot; For the most part this song sticks to Britney's pop roots.<BR>3) Lonely - This song really reminds me of Janet Jackson. This is an awesome song. They play with her voice a little in this song kinda like they did in Stronger. This has kinda a rock flare to it with alot f guitar sounds and bass beats. Really great song, ou can hear the emotion in Britney's voice as she sings it!<BR>4) I'm Not A Girl, Not yet A Woman - Britney second single and Theme song for her debut movie &quot;Crossroads&quot; Beautiful ballad composed of mostly piano, and Britney sings it VERY well. I've read in other reviews that say this song does not fit her voice but beleive me that is NOT true. She sings this song tremendesly well especially live.<BR>5) Boys - Second track on this album that was Produced by the Neptunes. Awesome club sounding track, definately a song girls can relate to! Whats cool about this track is for the most part the song is fast paced and upbeat but there are two little kind of balla breaks where the muic slows.<BR>6) Anticipating - AWESOME SONG!!!! Reminds me of the 80's! I love this song, has to be my favorite song after Overprotected. Basically she sings about a night out with her friends.<BR>7) I Love Rock 'N' Roll - In my opinion a good cover. MUCH better than her cover of &quot;Satisfaction&quot;! Anyways, personally I listened to the original after I heard this one and I like this one better because Joan Jetts acent just does the song NO justice! But Britney it to a new level with the sexy accents to the words and she sings it with of heart it sounds to me.<br />8) Cinderella - Again this song sounds like something from the 80's and I like that sound, but some may not. Good song and good message.<BR>9) Let Me Be - Good song written By Brit about people thinking you can't take the pressure and you can't succeed.<BR>10) Bombastic Love - This song has a good beat and ok Lyrics, not the best song on the album but fun to listen to.<BR>11) That's Where You Take Me - Second ballad on the album although more upbeat than Not A Girl, good song nice beat and lyrics.<br />12) What It's Like To Be Me - AWESOME SONG! My third favorite, co-written by Brit's man Justin. Awesome beat kinda techno inspired.<br />Overall this was an awesome album, but I would buy either the Australian or Japanese imports for the Soul fact the Bous tracks, &quot;Before The Goodbye&quot; &quot;I Run Away&quot; and &quot;When I Found You&quot;,<BR>Are awesome and should have been on the US but whatever. GET THIS CD IT'S AWESOME!!!

B00005RHGL|5.0|One of the best and most AUTHENTIC western movies can now be seen the way the director meant it to be seen. I loved the DTS soundtrack. It really gives the action scenes a lot of punch.<BR>The extra scenes that were added back in to the movie helped me to understand how some questionable scenes took place. One in particular, is a scene where Doc leaves Tombstone to help Wyatt track down the Cowboys. He has a confrontation w/ Kate about him leaving her behind. In the original treatment he just shows up w/ Wyatt at the train station and you never see Kate again. Also, the special features are very good. Especially the documentary. The packaging is some of the best I've seen for DVD. If you like this movie and you have a DVD player, you should get this version.
0440224764|5.0|If you've yet to read a Grisham novel, start here!  I've read most of them and this one stands out as, far and away, the most gripping.  The story drew me in and held my attention to the last page.  What a story!  Amazing, just amazing.
0694003611|5.0|By far, my 16-month old son's favorite book.  My wife and I read to our son every night and he almost always picks this book for us to read to him.  With its great narrative and colorful illustrations, this book should be on the shelf of any home with small children.
B000021YQV|5.0|System of A Down is the most politicaly charged band out there at this moment in time.  Few bands have had the ability to capture the ferocity of politics that S.O.A.D. employ.  TOXICITY is in no way an exception.  All of the songs have a point to make, and that point is made with intensity. &quot;ATWA&quot; is a beautifully orchestrated song on the environmental views of one Charles Manson and at times one cannot feel a little mournful.  Do not dismiss them however as just a political band, but rather think of them as a 'heavy mental' band for the politically aware.

B00005AQF7|4.0|No doubt this is Snoops best album. He teamed up with Dre and the result is a pure G-funk style and tales bout gangtas, pimps, hoes, guns...Straight gangsta rap...This album spread this gangsta s**t throughout America...Musically is a banga...But Im not giving the star missed cause &quot;G Funk intro&quot; and &quot;Lodi Dodi&quot; r kinda wack..And its good to listen a hungry Daz, Kurupt, Lady Of Rage, RBX, Nate Dogg...Everybody did their thing very well!!
B00000JZIK|3.0|the usual suspects is primarily interesting on one level: in it's ability to surprise. if you watch movies to be intrigued by plot twists and aren't looking for much emotional involvement, perhaps this is a movie which will please.  certainly the filmmakers and actors have created a clever piece of work.    if, on the other hand, you watch movies looking for something more-- let's say, something more mysterious, more ephemeral, something perhaps inspiring, or beautiful, something that gets into your soul the way great music (whether U2, Mahler, Miles Davis, Jeff Buckley, Manu Chao, Mozart, Cat Stevens, Eminem, you name your favorite)  or great movies can, then I personally see very little here for you.  there are no human truths here (the way there are in great thrillers by Hitchcock or John Huston, or Kurosawa (Rashoman-- that's clever, because it's about people!)  there is no emotional subtext (except perhaps the unwittingly revealing narcissism of the filmmaking and a couple of over the top, showy performances, which reminded me more of a fashion show than the art form practiced by brando, james dean, sean penn, etc, an art form which makes the human soul visible).       the sad part is that the audiences, whose capacities to feel have been reduced by suckling from the tv nipple for so many years, lapped it up, proclaiming it a \\"great movie.\\"   and critics, desperate to suck up to the crowd (and hungry to find anything remotely \\"new\\") lined up to proclaim its structure innovative and \\"post modern.\\"      in the end, i have nothing really against it except the fact that   i didn't care much about the characters and so i found the movie slightly boring despite all the games being played.  frankly, perhaps i found the general coldness of the movie off-putting.   even the darkest of characters usually have souls.    as a result, i felt that all the acclaim showed up how impoverished our pop culture (or at least the most hyped part of it) really is. (perhaps not a fairway to judge the film, but somehow the film seems to want to be taken seriously). if \\"chinatown\\" (a film with a dark but deeply felt vision of life) were released today, perhaps people would find it boring.      there are some true gems out there -- even the cohen brothers at their most \\"detached\\" still show an infinitely greater interest in the humanity of their characters than this film.    a masterpiece for the gameboy generation.<P....
B00005QZWJ|5.0|I have only had this CD for a little over 24 hours, and have already fallen in love with it. Once, when I turned the music off, I wasn't completly sure if I was hearing someone's CD or if the music was in my own head! This CD has beautiful music on it, and I strongly recommend it.<br />Over a year later....<BR>Even now I still love this music. I have listened to this CD over and over, and still there are parts that inspire me, and parts that cause me to pause and just listen. It is not a mistake to buy this CD, I believe.
0783226004|5.0|Sneakers is a great sleeper techno gadget thriller.  Robert Redford leads a fantastic, charismatic ensemble team (Sidney Poitier, Dan Akroyd, River Pheonix, Mary McDonnell &amp; David Strathairn)in this outstanding movie!  The villian is perfect too. (Ben Kingsley)<br />Summary: The Redford Security Expert Team is hired by the NSA (National Security Agency) to recover the ultimate BLACK BOX from a powerful corporate magnate villian (Kingsley), who happens to be Redfords old college friend.  This Black Box can decode any program!!  All turns out not so friendly and the techno cat &amp; mouse game thriller begins.<br />Outstanding value and the Widescreen DVD is an excellent transfer.  This is a fun movie &amp; Redford is at his best.  Enjoy.
B000002C2E|5.0|He hadn't had a 5-star album since Desire. This one is one of the top five Dylan albums of all time. First listen it sounds a ittle mainstream bluesy, but a few times into it and there is an intricacy that sustains the musical side, and Bob's voice rebounds, hasn't sounded this good since Ring them Bells on 89's Oh Mercy.<br />Kind of a bummer when you get so much enjoyment out of one man's misery, but this is one artist who follows his muse, and is at his best when she has left him and he questions the worthwhileness of everything.
B00005UKKF|5.0|Britney has done it yet again.  She is awesome, talented, her songs rock, and she is just all around BEAUTIFUL!!!I went to this concert and it was better in person!! People say that she was lyp syncing---but they are wrong! I was there~!! This DVD will be packed with awesome performances and you will love every minute of it!!! And besides, it's Britney Spears! Who wouldn't love it (besides those few who hate her because they are so jealous it's scary!)!  Anyway, I wish that they had ten stars because it is worth that much and more! ENJOY!

B000000WHX|5.0|Arrogant, pretentious, self-absorbed.  These harsh adjectives have been used to describe Massive Attack lately.  But for all of the harsh words thrown their way, they sure make one hell of a CD.  This is it.  The originator, the innovator, the percolator of trip-hop.  And what a CD it is.  At first listen, some songs are great, while others are obnoxious.  Some you wish would go on forever, while others go overlong.  But as you listen, the album sticks to you like white on rice.<br />I'm not  fan of giving CD's five stars.  But Blue Lines is truly a masterpeice.  It takes the best elements of reggae, house, hip-hop, funk, and soul and puts them in a blender.  Every song, with the help of a number of guest vocalists, sounds completely different from the last.  The album has a cohesiveness that few albums share nowadays.  This is truly a record that can be appreciated as an entire record, front-to-back, rather than just a compilation of songs.<br />High points: Too many to count.  Safe From Harm is a stellar and spacey opener, with One Love following it up with a brilliant reggae vibe.  Five man Army could be the mellowest hip-hop song in history, and Unfinished Sympathy evokes feelings that had not yet been seen in electronic music.<br />Low points: I wish I could say that there aren't any, but Daydreaming (the first single, no less) can get a little repetitive, as can Lately, but that hardly keeps it from being a perfect album.  If you are a music fan and can stand to listen to equipment that's a little outdated.  Do not hesitate.  buy now.

Yes everything has been done and we pray to the gods of The Pottery Barn but you can break free.  It is a crazy ride and you must watch it twice to truly appreciate its strangeness.  I hope for your sake that you don't know the bizarre twist because it makes it even better.  Edward Norton is unbelievable as always and Brad Pitt is made for the role.  All I know is that after I watched it I blew up my fully furnished apartment, burned all my catalogues, quit my job and am now writing the great American Novel.  Oh wait, it has already been written by Chuck Palanuik. Read the book too!
B00005R2M3|4.0|Shakira knocks your socks off with her great voice and terrific band.  The songs in Spanish are beautiful and make you want to learn the language.  Many CD's you buy, you like 2-3 of the songs and the rest are just okay.  Laundry Service--every song is great and gets stuck in your head.  &quot;Whenever, Whereever&quot; is really a great song.
0679882820|4.0|My daughter loves this book.  We began reading it to her when she was about 15 months old.  The best part is that thunder and lightning are addressed in the book.  So that when she was a little scared of a thunder storm, we just say &quot;boom, boom, boom&quot; and laugh like we do when we read the book.

Follett does not overload his stories with too many technical descriptions, nor does he insult the reader's intelligence; thereby creating a quick, entertaining read.  Set during the time of the space race and Cold War of the 1950s, Follett dissects the loyalties among college friends who met and came of age at the dawn of World War II.  Although predictable and littered with clichs, I still found it highly engrossing.
B000001Y5J|5.0|That lyric just about sums up this CD. It's nothing worse than perfect, but if it was meant to last, it would suck. Think about it, this CD is only 26 minutes long, and for good reason. All 8 songs rock, but a full CD would get very repetitive.<br />However, I love this CD. It's addicting. I mean, just listen to &quot;Pinion&quot;. It slowly get louder and louder, and better and better. &quot;Wish&quot; won a grammy, and with good reason. The highlight of the CD though is &quot;Last&quot;. It just might be my favorite NIN song. &quot;Help Me...&quot; is just an interlude. &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; pretty much sums up NIN...unpredictable. Starts heavy, then it gets in to a nice techno beat, then the same thing again. &quot;Gave Up&quot; is awesome. That's all I can say about that song. &quot;Physical&quot; is a big departure, but I love it. &quot;Suck&quot; is pretty good.<br />All in all, an excellent CD. If you don't have any NIN, buy Downward Spiral, then The Fragile, but then pick this and Fixed up.
B00005JKQX|5.0|&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I saw it first with my husband and was so mesmerized that I went to see it again with my 12 year old daughter.  We all thought it was superb!  I was then curious by the story of John Nash so I bought the book.  Still not satisfied, I rented other Russell Crowe films to see just how this man evolved as an actor.  He has made many terrific films with very diverse roles, but this is by far the best in my opinion - he &quot;aced&quot; this character. I definitely give the power of the movie to the acting of Crowe.  I honestly forgot I was watching an actor on screen - he was that believable. Ron Howard did a great job portraying the film through the mind of Nash.  I had such emotion built up inside of me for the struggles of John Nash that I felt emotionally &quot;spent&quot; after the movie.  Jennifer Conley was terrific and had great chemistry with Crowe as husband and wife - a very believable couple.  The supporting cast did everything right.  My advise - SEE THIS MOVIE - more than once!  Buy the book for some insights on Nash - it's fascinating. The movie does leave some facts about Nash out of the plot, but I understand why - it would complicate the complex story of schizophrenia even more. Bravo to A Beautiful Mind and a beautiful portrayal of John Nash by Russell Crowe!  Good job mate! I'll be cheering for you on Oscar night.
1587990717|2.0|I found the book diffcult to follow because the author is writing down to his audience. He tantalizes us with broad generalizations but fails to provide the kind of back-up detail which will support his conclusions. His language in many instances is vague and the syntax unclear.  I suspect the trouble is that he knows what he is talking about, but can't express his ideas clearly in layman's languague and he dare not get into the math of the subject because it is too complex. People who enjoyed the book mostly seemed to do so because he uses a variety of examples and techniques to provide amusing or human traits, but they simply do not add up to a clear exposition of his main theme. which, I think, is that when it comes to randomness few people can detect the signal from the noise.  P. T. Barnum expressed it clearly and simply years ago. &quot;There's a sucker born every minute.&quot;
6302968135|5.0|Even after seeing this film over 20 times, it still is the best film ever produced! Three characters, all very different, all thrilling, a stunning display of acting by all three actors. The story about rivaling gangs in and outside the prison walls of San Quentin is exciting from the beginning till the end, with great eye for detail. A must-see for everyone who's into cult films!
B00005QATY|5.0|I saw this movie at my daughters house. At first I thought it was going to be just another stupid, ridiculous comedy but the GREAT MUSIC had me hooked. I watched the whole thing and am glad I did. I'm buying my own copy so I can watch it again and again if for no other reason than to watch the &quot;Soggy Bottom Gang&quot; performance.  <BR>Funny Stuff!!
B00001IVOF|5.0|I just got this CD and sent it back and got it again. Although it is THE best CD I have ever bought, the CD crackles and has static in the background. Does anyone else have this happen? I know it isnt my stereo. Please help. This CD is awesome and its pissing me off.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Russell Crowe is BRILLIANT, AMAZING. I have never been so riveted by a movie or by an actor's performance. 10 stars!
0006531407|5.0|This book is great!  It tells you (and shows you)how to make shelters, catch food, tie knots, what different plants and animals are good, bad, deadly, and edible(through color pictures).  The book goes into detail about basic wilderness first aid and it also talks about everything from ocean to desert survival and even to nuclear fallout!  It has detailed pictures and descriptions on just about everything.  Buy this one...you won't be sorry.
B00005R2M3|3.0|I was a Shakira fan about a year before she came out with Laundry Service.  This is an AWESOME CD and Shakira has tons of talent.  However, the reason I gave it a 3 was that she repeats some of the same songs she sings in English in Spanish...that is kinda annoying b/c it's 4 or 5 tracks less...overall it's an exceptional piece of work! Go Shakira!
B000056IKS|4.0|Neu! extends their hypnotic style from the first album, throwing in tape experimentation, slowing down and speeding up the music. Despite the toying, the music is still very catchy and accessible.
0385505833|5.0|This book was so enjoyable - very funny and easy to imagine vividly each scene.  The second half was hysterical and I laughed out loud throughout,leaving my family to wonder what was wrong with me.  The book reminds me of a cross between the movie &quot;Its a wonderful Life&quot; and  several movies with the &quot;Griswalds&quot; with Chevy Chase. It was very light, fun reading with a message. Most entertaning book I have read in ages!!  Also a surprise touching ending. Loved it.
B000002UCN|5.0|simply the best from george<BR>but there are 2 more songs that supposed to be in the cd:<BR>i need you<BR>dont bother me<BR>just excellent
0345413377|5.0|This was a thrilling book, leading you through suspense filled, jaw dropping adventures, that include use of the Subtle Knife, the Golden Compass, and most importantly, the Amber Spyglass. This book will take you more in depth of Dust, and simply amaze you. A must read.
B00000JG41|5.0|At the present moment, this is the only CD with Mike Patton on it that I own. However, I feel the urge to get more. These guys have great instrumentation (&quot;None of Them Were Robots,&quot; &quot;Goodbye Sober Day&quot;), and extremely depressing lyrics that seem eerie when paired with the seemingly upbeat music (&quot;The Air Conditioned Nightmare,&quot; &quot;PInk Cigarette&quot;). Pop music was almost proclaimed dead, but then I heard these guys. Mike Patton is a modern day Syd Barrett, and you will find as much insane genius here as on Piper at the Gates of Dawn. If you are fed up with all that crud on the radio, and want some GOOD music, definatly check out Mr. Bungle.<br />DISCLAIMER: Because of its wierdness, it may take you a few months to get accustomed to California. Once you do, you'll love it.
0395177111|5.0|J.R.R. Tolkien really captures the imagination that a young child has.  The Hobbit shows you a whole new side of the world.  Whether you're sitting on your couch or flying in the claws of an eagle, you can't help but love the adventure that Bilbo Baggins is experiancing. You begin to have a real fear of the goblins, and to admire Gandolf for his wisdom.  The Hobbit truly brings out the inner child in any adult.

B00005A46U|4.0|If I Could Do It All Over Again is the second album from one of the great Canterbury prog bands. This was their first album on a new label, Decca in the UK and London in the US. While I think their self-entitled debut is excellent and I recommend it greatly, the major problem of that album is the really horrible muddy sound quality. However, on their followup, the sound quality has improved greatly making it easy to hear both the instruments and the vocals, which was a little difficult to hear on their debut. &quot;If I Could Do It All Over Again&quot; finds Caravan doing lengthier, more adventurous numbers. This is also their first album to feature David Sinclair trademark fuzz organ sound (their debut features him playing more standard Hammond organ sounds). There are a few great pop numbers like the title track, &quot;With an Ear to the Ground...&quot; and my favorite, &quot;Hello Hello&quot; (sung by Richard Sinclair, this album only had two cuts with him on vocals, rest are by Pye Hastings). There's an original version of &quot;For Richard&quot; (actually divided in to several songs, like &quot;Can't Be Long Now&quot;, for example) which they did a much better version on Caravan &amp; the New Symphonia. Of course this version is still great, but the New Symphonia version is simply more energetic and powerful. There's another cut called &quot;Asforteri&quot;, and if you think of it, the word seems to mean &quot;As for Terry&quot;, as in their manager Terry King. This is one of those great albums you can tell something better was down the road, and that will be with their followup album, In the Land of Grey &amp; Pink, but don't worry, If I Could Do It All Over Again still has that wonderful classic Caravan sound and if you're a Caravan fan, you should not go without this album.
0345360338|5.0|I just finished reading this book, and while it wasn't quite as romantic as the first in the trilogy (Here Be Dragons), it was an excellent read.  It focuses on the life of Simon de Montfort, who is often called the father of representative government.  I fell in love with him while reading this, as I fell in love with Llewelyn Fawr in the first book of the trilogy.  Ms. Penman's characters are so well developed that you will feel close to them, as if you knew them in real life!
B00005U11Z|5.0|First off, I'd like to correct another reviewer who says there is something wrong with the 5.1 surround mix on this DVD.  There is NOTHING wrong with it!  The center channel is used for &quot;ambiance&quot;, rather than just piping the lead vocals through it.  Many of the &quot;live&quot; concert DVD's do this to offer more of a &quot;live&quot; sound.  The 5.1 mix is very tight and will definitely give your system a workout.  The stereo mix is outstanding too!<br />Now...on to the rest of the DVD.  If you've never seen Journey live, this DVD will show you exactly why they are one of the tightest &quot;live&quot; bands in the history of Rock &amp; Roll.  I've seen Journey live 6 times ('82,'83,'98,'99 &amp; twice in '01)...and they NEVER dissapoint!<br />The current lineup is the best ever (yes...there have been several lineup changes in this band).  Deen Castronovo is nothing less than a genius on drums!  You will be floored by this man's ability.  Founding members Neal Schon &amp; Ross Valory have never sounded better.  Neal puts on a guitar clinic every time he touches the strings, and Ross provides a strong backbone (and a funnybone) to Journey's music.  Jonathan Cain is the master of the keys....and one heck of a great rhythm guitar player.  Finally, Steve Augeri (who has been Journey's lead singer for 4 years now) is amazing.  He sings Journey's classics with a strength and passion that even a certain Mr. P. could not achieve at this point in history.<br />Get this DVD and prepare to have the time of your life!  Then, go out and see the band live when they tour this summer!<br />P.S.  The extras on the DVD are very sparce, but the quality of the performance more than makes up for it.
0393312836|5.0|No book has captured the disillusionment and separation resulting from the schizm formed of technological advancement and cultural devolvement like 'A clockwork Orange' has. Quite simply put, it is a not too distant future of ours. As technology breeds increased comfort and increased isolationism, it also breeds racism, hatred and desensitization. This near 40 year old book really captures this feeling, daring to the reader to attempt to define 'free will' in a world in which all images and content are provided for you and have a singular semiotic meaning. In light of our all too common subway shootouts, our random executions and a penal system spiraling out of control (all things happening relatively recently), it is amazing that Burgess could so accurately cast a world of rave clubs, X, random abuse and Ikea furniture.<BR> <BR>     This version has the 'controversial' 21st chapter, and let me say the controversy really lies on the choice of the idiot editor who removed it in the first place. It sums up so much and adds an interesting twist to the theme of the book. <BR> <BR>     If you are between the ages of 16 and 45 and consider yourself to have a social conciousness, this is THE must read book.
B00003CXXS|5.0|Simply stated JURASSIC PARK III is much better on DVD from the two showings I saw in the theatre. For one thing the images are much sharper and crisp than what I saw on the silver screen. This alone makes it worth having on DVD. Also, and probably more important JURASSIC PARK III is a good film. It's quite a change of pace from its two predecessors. It takes getting used to. There is actually a much more solid plot line and even character development evident from when I first saw it. The film moves at a fast pace or so it appears that it may gloss over you if you were expecting something different. I would have to say that I really enjoyed this movie on DVD. It looks and sounds great.
B00005QZWI|3.0|One of my fellow movie-goers has been known to say that if he doesn't notice the music in a movie, it fits.  If that's the case, then Howard Shore's score for this first installment of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; would have five stars.  Rarely did I pick up on his heavy percussion or massive vocals...but that might be because I was too engrossed in the epic visually-impressive tale unfolding before my eyes.  However, it is once removed from the screen that the music develops its own personality.<br />Refreshingly remiscent, Shore has composed an enjoyable tapestry, drawing from and perfecting the massively dramatic technics of John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith and the emotionally charged lulls of James Horner and Hans Zimmer while at the same time infusing his own &quot;quirks&quot;.  Shore makes no attempt at deception as the opening track, &quot;The Prophecy&quot; unfolds with a booming choral arrangement, hurling the listener forward into a maelstrom of darkness reminscent of one's most tumultuous nightmares.  We've been given fair warning: this is going to be one hell of a ride.<br />The hobbits theme featured most prominently in &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; is absolutely enchanting; one can hardly help from laughing as it beckons images of tiny halflings adorned in their capes scampering about The Shire.  &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum&quot; is not for the faint of heart as it pounces on the listener with an invigorating barrage of brass and percussion, then corners us with an arrangement of chillingly demonic male chantings, only to have all subside as the softer sounds of a female chorus wash wash away all fear and harber the sorrow of a lost comrade, gently lifting us with a beautiful soprano solo yet bitterly wrenching in its emptiness.  And of course &quot;Lothlorien&quot;, with its other-worldly ambience is absolute magic to behold.<br />Also noteworthy is Enya's contributions, not the least of which being &quot;May It Be&quot; for the end credits.  Absolutely soothing.<br />And yet amidst all this wonder, the score somehow manages to sound surprisingly redundant.  Nearly every track sounds in some way reminiscent of a previous one.  However, this is a small &quot;quirk&quot; and easily overlooked.  My advice: turn out the lights, close your eyes, and let this landscape become your world for an hour and eleven minutes.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|THis is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I don't know the game it's based on so perhaps I can't complain.<BR>It is still awful. No substantial plot, no dialogue, no acting, no directing, no talent. <BR>I would sell my DVD copy but I don't want to afflict this bad movie on anyone else.
B000002KHH|5.0|Black Sabbath's finest album, &quot;Paranoid&quot;, was a classic when it was first released, and remains Sabbath's most influential album.  Classics like &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;War Pigs&quot;, &quot;Planet Caravan&quot;, &quot;Electric Funeral&quot;, and the classic title track are all here, and without a doubt is this the definitive Sabbath album.
B00004TH83|5.0|I thought she sings so powerfully, with great pottential. She is inside out a beautiful person, and wonderfully talented.
B0000067L2|4.0|What separates a power trio (such as ZZ Top or Gov't Mule) from a rock band who happen to have only three members (such as the Police or Ben Folds Five) is that while a three-pierce rock outfit band can explore any avenue, power trio is a term strictly reserved a group that forsakes most of hard rock's excesses and takes the genre down to its bluesy basics. A power trio's members mix together superbly and keep a self-possessed attitude about their sharp, electric grinding. Disreali Gears, from the British bluesrock band, Cream, is one of the ultimate albums by this variety of rock band. The LP swings between outstanding backdoor blues (\\"Take It Back,\\" \\"Outside Woman Blues\\") and swerving psychedelia (\\"Dance the Night Away,\\" \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses,\\"). It features some of the band's most beloved compositions, including the wavy \\"Strange Brew;\\" the rapid-fire rocker, \\"Swlabr;\\" and the irresistible, flawless, psychedelic anthem, \\"Sunshine of Your Love.\\" These tightly tuned, masterfully executed performances feature a pitch-perfect, taut chemistry that would not only not benefit from additional personal, but could be harmed by them. Disreali Gears makes a strong argument for power trios.
0440178002|5.0|The size and scope of this book is breathtaking.  Clavell's tale of feudal Japan and the &quot;barbaric&quot; Europeans who land on its shores is a classic.  The story is inserted nicely into that mysterious and pivotal time period when countries began to break out of their boundaries with ocean exploration.  While some criticisms exist that claim Clavell was a little off on his &quot;Japanese culture portrayal&quot;, I must say he held true to his depiction throughout the whole book.  Some authors let their culture values bleed together.  Clavell presented a Japan that was alive with culture, grace, violence, and tradition.  He did a good job presenting the varied European groups as well, pitting the English against the Portuguese and Spanish.  I was also intrigued by the presentation of the Church (possibly a little over the top, but fascinating nonetheless).  I couldn't put this book down once it got going.  Highly recommended.
B000002C1V|4.0|Dark Side of the Moon is paranoiac; Wish You Were Here is mournful; Animals is scathing; the Wall is disturbing but none of Pink Floyd's albums are as discouraging as the utterly bleak last release of their classic years, the Final Cut. The 1983 album takes every step to alienate every audience except for the most involved, infatuated listener. The arrangements are lethargic, subdued and extremely anti-septic. The vocals are inaudibly soft one moment and boisterously loud the next without warning or middle ground. The lyrics are distant, complex and utterly desolate. Do not expect of coy emotional expressions and rich, lush ambience of other Floyd records and certainly do not expect a catchy single like \\"Money\\" and \\"Another Brick in the Wall Part II\\"<br />Instead, the Final Cut presents a gloomy, vivid portrait of a morally crumbling post-WWII England. The album is fixated on the second World War and what the personal and societal sacrifices of that conflict mean to Great Britain in 1983. \\"What have we done to England?/Should we shout, should we scream/`What happened to the post war dream?'\\" lyricist, Roger Waters asks on \\"The Postwar Dream.\\" Throughout the Final Cut, Mr. Waters (who lost his father in World War II) explores that inquiry. He presents a cast of disgruntled, discontented veterans who are disappointed in the generation they preserved (\\"One of the Few,\\" \\"The Hero's Return\\"), pursued by ghosts (\\"One of Your Possible Pasts\\" \\"Paranoid Eyes\\") and mentally eroding (\\"The Fletcher Memorial Home,\\" the title track) while simultaneously pointing a finger at British Prime Minster Margaret Thatcher and others who betrayed the nation's post-1945 socialist ideals (\\"Not Now John,\\" \\"Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert,\\" \\"The Postwar Dream\\"). Here Waters is at his most stunning but he is also at his most embittered, complicated and convoluted. It is possible to enjoy the Final Cut. But the lyric booklet, a pair of headphones, your undivided attention and a strictly analytical approach to music are all necessary.
0805066691|3.0|It concerns me how well people review this book in general. The book is good, don't get me wrong. But 5 stars? Not remotely close. 4 stars? I would say not due to it's unbalanced view of history. Are there good points? Clearly there are a great many accounts of things our government does wrong. But just as there are good points, there are bad points as well. Let me start with those.<br />It's bothersome that he gets some very basic facts wrong, such as the way Crazy Horse got his name. Crazy Horse's father was named Crazy Horse. Yet Brown goes into some mythical explanation of where it came from. There are other points in the book he does this.<br />Referring to Crows that work for the whites as &quot;mercenaries&quot; bothers me as well. Don't people question the loaded nature of the word &quot;mercenary&quot;? Why were they not opportunists? Especially since the Crows were always at war with the Sioux? But when a Native American took arms against another in the name of the white, he adopted the bad traits Brown unilaterally gives white settlers in this book.<br />Brown never explores the cultures that led conflicts to end the way they do. He does not explore the fact that white history does not act like Native American in that 1 or 2 deaths is bad. There are deep underlying cultural causes to explore here that he does not. However, this is not a Brown specific problem. Most Indian books ignore this.<br />Brown totally glosses over the reality of how Lewis and Clark were treated by the Nez Perces. He claims that they were totally gracious and accomodating hosts when the reality was that stealing from the white was commonplace.<br />As in his &quot;mercenary&quot; use, there are always loaded adjectives that taint the narrative to say what he wants and not paint a factual picture. Saying things like Victorio was &quot;slaughtered&quot; instead of killed.<br />Saying that it was acceptible for the Modocs to &quot;tax&quot; the whites as they stole items from them was a gross justification by Brown.<br />Finally, the way he states Canad &quot;treated&quot; Sitting Bull. He complained that the US would not just leave the Hunkpapas alone. But when Canada did exactly this, he complains about it as well. There is no consistency with his work.<br />Ok, so those are the bad things. What about the good things?<br />Brown very successfully highlights the problems just about every Indian chief had in dealing with wiser elders and more reactionary youths. This continued rock/hard place scenario plays itself out in chapter after chapter.<br />The above is the well done in the book and really shows the youth versus the old and stands as a commentary to the ongoing theme of social unrest in society and its inherent nature as youth does not have the wisdom of age.<br />Brown highlights the irony of the Comanche history of planting food, then being driven out, then being told they should be planting crops. Very poignant and indicative of the US government in how they treated the natives.<br />Brown also documents well the continued destroying and ignoring of treaties. This is interesting because the US does the same thing today.<br />Brown's book is painfuly researched. This much is clear. But it bothers me that after so much research, an indian death is a slaughter and a white death is revenge. He paints every Native American as an innocent bystander forced to protect himself and every white as an Indian hating racist.<br />Again, there are good points to the book. But you have to be very careful of the loaded nature of it. I would recommend reading this after you have red several other West/Indian books.a gross justification by Brown.<br />Finally, the way he states Canad &quot;treated&quot; Sitting Bull.

6305508550|4.0|The _MOVIE_ &quot;Office Space&quot; gets 5/5 stars in my book. Yeah, the plot is minimal, but the dialog and the characters are wonderful! However, I give the _DVD_ only 3/5 stars. This movie has so much potential for an enhanced DVD experience, but there's little in the way of extras. The trailer is included, but that's about it. Some interactive features, director's notes, or how about the _original_ &quot;Office Space&quot; animation that focused on Milton!! I'd love to get both in one package. So overall, 4/5.

0385484518|5.0|I found this book to be very useful to anyone dealing with friends or family going through the dying process.  It provided a lot of insight and a different take on death and dying.  His writing style allows a wide variety of people to connect with his experience.
0425107469|5.0|I absolutly loved this book!from the first time I read it in high school ten years ago, to the time I read it last summer, it hasn't lost it's touch. I have never read any author who has captured the wonderful compasion of such a simple soul, as that of a dog like Dean has. Being a dog lover, I can totally relate with much of the manorisms, and behaviors that he has described in the wonderful Einstein. Also, the beast, who only longed for the same love that the dog had all along-I found myself feeling very sorry for him, even though he was the whole familys worst enemy. I feel the whole book, cover to cover, is the best book I have ever read, and every time I read the last sentance, I cry..Call me a sap, but this book nails it. It's freakin good reading-especially if you love animals of any kind, and you appreciate a good love story too. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of gore and suspense, but overall, I think anyone (except that one previous guy who reviewed) will really like this book.It's the BEST!!!!!!
B00005R2M3|5.0|I know her since she had 13 years old and all this time I've been following her throughout her career.  She is different from other artists that I know, and I know she will become the kind of artist that by the time you hear it you'll with her,  the meaning of her words is incredible.  I recommend this CD not only because I'm her fan but she did a very good work even though the English language is not her native language.
0345413377|3.0|I really loved &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; and I thought &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; was great, too: intellectually intriguing, engrossing, and well-crafted. I hate to be a nay-sayer, but I really thought the story fell flat in this final installment. Pullman is amazingly ambitious in this trilogy--so ambitious that he has simply has gotten in over his head by Vol. 3. To effectively pull all the various threads together that he has started working with in Vols. 1 and 2, he would need about three more books--not one--in my opinion. I thought this third book felt rushed throughout. Its pace was totally different than the other two books. I also thought the &quot;love story&quot; part came out of left field and was a little weird and off-putting. (I'm sure others will disagree with me on that.)<br />All that said, I still think this series as a whole is well-worth reading, and would give it four stars overall.
0060977493|5.0|I admit, the first time I tried to read this book, I could not get through it. However, when I went back to it, I could not put<br />it down! I was mesmerized by Roy's innovative use of the English language. The metaphors and imagery she invokes on every page are stunning. The storyline has a combination &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; and &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; feel to it, and shows how the mistakes of one generation can wreak havoc on generations to come.

(I'm sure others will disagree with me on that.)<br />All that said, I still think this series as a whole is well-worth reading, and would give it four stars overall.
B000002VTE|1.0|This album comes about as close to representing the feeling of  floating in space as a punch in the arm. Annoying, overproduced garbage.

B00005OCMR|2.0|I've seen every version of TRON available, from the Laserdiscs to the two DVD pressings.<br />I was really excited about the new TRON special edition DVD disc set, but was very disappointed when I dropped this one into my DVD player. Unlike the first DVD release of TRON and the Laserdisc box set, the special edition is severely horizontally squeezed. Why Disney opted to do this -- I have no idea. Unfortunately, this ruined it for me (and many others -- I'm sure).<br />As well, the transfer is horrid. It's easily as bad as the previous DVD (terrible DVD compression artifacting). If you want to see a good transfer, try to hunt down the special edition Laserdisc set. In fact, if Disney has no clean prints, they could simply digitize the LaserDisc (and lower the compression settings, while they're at it). It would be an improvement.<br />So, once-again, I've been led to believe that Disney would take some pride in such a land-mark film -- and once-again, I've been shown quite the opposite.<br />The one real plus to the special edition is the production information on the second disc (as well as the 'making of' documentary). Interestingly, the aspect ratio and frame treatment of the production material is correct.<br />Did Disney somehow think that nobody would notice??<br />WTF?<br />        -- Rorian.
B00003CXXP|4.0|God, man. Man, android. The second wants to become the first. None of them can. That's the metaphore behind this movie. It`s a shame that it had to take almost 3 hours to express eternity and death.

B000002UYZ|5.0|The &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; Beatles CDs are testament to the genius of the band's music and are an excellent overview and a great place to start for those uninitiated (if there are such people) with the greatest band in history.<br />1962-1966 (&quot;Red&quot;) covers the Beatles' Merseybeat era, a time when the Beatles were considered a singles &quot;teenybopper&quot; band. Among the best cuts on the first CD are &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, &quot;She Loves You&quot;, &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;, and &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;.<br />Their progression from teenyboppers to &quot;serious band&quot; begins to show in the songs from 1965's Rubber Soul, including &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, featuring George Harrison on the sitar, and John Lennon's introspective &quot;In My Life&quot;, which hints at the band's glorious and more complex studio work that was to follow.<br />The Red CD collection ends with two songs from 1966's Revolver, a record that placed the band on even higher creative ground: Paul McCartney's masterpiece &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; is the first time a string quartet accompanied a rock and roll record, and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; was one in a line of catchy, childlike songs written for resident jester and drummer extrodinaire Ringo Starr.<br />The first disc of 1967-1970 (&quot;Blue&quot;) has the far more unenviable task of selecting four representative tracks from 1967's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, still considered to be the most ground-breaking and influential album in the history of rock. &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; is the standout -- Sgt. Pepper's closer and emotional peak. <br />The CD closes with the two songs that best demonstrate the eventual clash in Lennon and McCartney's songwriting styles: McCartney's &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and Lennon's &quot;Revolution&quot; were sides A and B respectively of the Beatles' greatest-selling (and perhaps just &quot;greatest&quot;) single. Where Lennon's song is a snarling, self-righteous rocker, McCartney's is a sing-song orchestral ballad. The one you like best probably depends on whether you're a &quot;John&quot; or &quot;Paul&quot; person -- truth is they're both great.<br />The final CD spans from 1968's The Beatles (&quot;The White Album&quot;) to the end of the band's career. McCartney's best moments &quot;Let it Be&quot;, &quot;Get Back&quot;, and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; (Despite that over-the-top Phil Spector production) are here, as are Lennon's &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; and &quot;Come Together&quot;. The closer is &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot;, though it's perhaps a weaker conclusion than &quot;Two of Us&quot; might have been.<br />The Red and Blue collections are awesome reminders of the Beatles' past accomplishments and their continued vitality even today.

0671027344|5.0|What a tremendous book, based on changing and developing in the messed up society that we live in.  Charlie is a tender hearted boy that just about every High School student can relate to.  The parties, the drugs, the friends....these are all very realistic activities for many students, yet Charlie's extraordinary friendships are something many people only dream of.  Charlie's insight is somewhat comical, but yet in a way very somber. Seeing the world through the eyes of a so-called &quot;wallflower&quot; is very enlightening. The fact that the reader is left to interpret who Charlie is actually writing to, makes this story intriguing and I personally want to know what has come of him.  Not falling in love with Charlie's character isn't an option when reading this heart wrenching story involving the things they don't teach you in high school.

B00005IC2H|5.0|I discovered Sigur Ros by accident via a soundclip on the net while I was in the process of looking for more great sounds from Iceland.  I had just seen 101 Reykjavik (a good movie with a good soundtrack, so I wanted to know more.  Sigur Ros is transporting, their music astounding despite its smooth flow and beautiful sounds.  They're innovative artists who make what they like, so they're not only good, they're respectable.  The sound is fresh in a world where the din of Britney and Back Street invades everywhere.  And he plays his guitar with a bow!!!  Love them.
B00005QEO2|3.0|This is Aerosmith's fourth attempt at a  best of collection, and it's the fourth to omit my two favorite Aerosmith songs (I'm not the only one who has picked these among favorites), &quot;Sick As A Dog&quot; From &quot;Rocks&quot; and &quot;Seasons of Wither&quot; from &quot;Get Your Wings&quot;. I walked into a club last weekend and the DJ was playing &quot;Dog, then he played it again. The crowd cheered. At least somebody got it right!
6304080921|5.0|I will not attempt to describe the plot as this has already been done rather well by a number of people. I will just rave... 12 Monkeys is the most breathtaking piece of recursive temporal symmetry since Joyce's Finnegan's Wake. Perhaps one of the most perfectly conceived and executed movies of all time - up there with Blade Runner and Jacob's Ladder.<br />While the Wake is structured around a recursive temporal spiral, overlaying an archetypally-driven consciousness matrix, 12 Monkeys is necessarily simpler, because of its movie format. Yet the movie generates the same transcendent majesty as the concluding temporal convergence reveals to the viewer that this has been as much a spiritual odyssey as a brilliantly constructed Science Fiction story.<br />Without giving anything away, the bitter-sweet climax is one of the most stunning and uplifting scenes in the history of the film industry. This total classic and its cast and crew should have won everything in sight. It's way over Joe Wife Beater's head, but any true Sci Fi fan will love it.
B00005ARDC|4.0|They are young, they are raw, they are innocent, they are from sunny California, but \\"B.R.M.C\\"s self titled first album is less fun/sun/water, its more Jesus & Mary Chain noise, Phil Spector fuzzy Wall-of-Sound, black leather jackets-drug abuse and dirty fingernails et.al. In terms of redefining pure R.O.C.K, this album grabs you almost the same way the \\"Strokes\\" album did a few months ago. It means also that the \\"Motorcycle Club\\" sure have learned his lesson well by listening to some old VU and/or Rolling Stones records, but its the ruthless drive of each song and their passionate performances that save them from any such thing as plagiatism. Even if you dont ride a motorcycle (I dont either !) you should give this album a try ! The next big thing is on its way. Rock, rock on !
B00005NB8K|5.0|I remember being twelve years old back in 1991 when the movie was beginning to first open out at the theaters. Back then I remember seeing the preview on T.V. and I was suddenly interested. And I didn't even know a thing about The Doors or who they were. When the movie first came on cable and when I finally had a chance to see it, I was hooked on the movie that every time it came on T.V., I would watch it. It also made me wanted to learn more about the rock group, well Jim Morrison especially. My brother just gave me the Special Edition DVD for Christmas because he knows how much I love the movie. After reading the other reviews I didn't know the movie was not true. But I do remember watching &quot;The Road of Excess&quot; documentary on the second disc and I remember the people who knew Jim Morrison saying something like the way he was portrayed in the movie, he was not really like that in real life. But so what. True or not true, The Doors is still one of my favorite movies of all time, and I can never get tired of it.
0393314804|5.0|I read trainspotting in about three days, which, for me, a semi-literate, self-absorsed, junkie teenager is pretty good. I didn't have a bit of difficulty with the dialect, in fact Welsh has a much better writer's ear than noted &quot;greats&quot; Pynchon or Burroughs. All you have to do is hear it in your head, a skill which comes naturally for those of us who move our lips when we read. And nobody puts you in the picture like Irv. Of course he steals from his predecessors, but that just shows he has good taste. As for a lack of a plot; here's the plot: Margaret Thatcher's Tory Administration served to seriously damage Scottland's (and working class England's) economy. Once well-payed and well respected workers were now often broke or on the dole (that's &quot;slang&quot; for welfare). Pour newfound poverty and strife into ill-considered project-style tenement housing (they call them &quot;schemes&quot;), add Heroin to the mix and you end up with this tragic generation of self-absorbed, absurdist junkies. If you understand the context, the resultant ride is fascinating. And entertaining as hell!
0446678430|3.0|I read thru the reviews on this site for this book and it's interesting to apply the perspectives of this book to the reviews.  The reviewer who agrees with the principles but says that it's only for people who have disposable income is viewing the book within the context of most people.  If you believe the authors, they started their financial plan from a position where they didn't have jobs or money, yet they succeeded without getting full time jobs or entering the employee mentality.  And the reviewer who states that money isn't everything is missing the point as well.  Money isn't everything but it enables you to do things you WANT to do rather than having to do things to survive.  The point of the book is not to get rich at all costs but do understand that being rich doesn't mean necessarily that you had to give up your soul to get there.  As I see it (not having read the other books in the series), the biggest flaws of the book is that (1) he repeats himself a LOT and (2) he doesn't really go into detail about HOW he and his wife managed to work on his plan without getting full time jobs and where they found the money to learn all that he said he learned in the first two years of their plan without getting full time jobs.  The relationship of content and context is a great thing to point out however, since our context does limit our ability to absorb and process content.  It's an interesting read but the real applicaiton of his advice is a bit vague.
078322608X|5.0|Really great....this is one of those several-times-watched movies of mine (and there's not many of those).  This is the type of movie you watch, and then invite your friends over to watch, simply to see and hear their reaction, and then discuss it with them.  A whole new respect for Brad Pitt's acting and adaptability to roles emerged after this movie, as well as thorough appreciation for both Willis and Stowe and the way they carry they carry thier roles out, and infuse the film with their presence.  See this.
B0000057C5|4.0|I really liked the cd but I was reading the other reviews and I'm now really confused about Du Hast. Some say it's you hate and others say its you have. But anyways, I love the music and their voices. Nice and deep. I really like Klavier.
B00003CX5P|2.0|I mean it.  My first response to Episode 1 was the same resounding disappointment that was felt and expressed by many other movie viewers who hoped for and expected a progression in a style more fitting with the traditional Star Wars mythology.  This just wasn't it.  This was a phenomenal dose of glitz, far more than would have been neccessary, or even fitting, to really please those who have high appreciation for the trilogy.  <br />However, I highly doubt that Lucas was even thinking of this category of moviegoers through the creation of this film.  In fact, I really hope he wasn't, because there is such a seemingly enormous break with tradition here, that the rift seems to be precisely the point.  <br />Though I did not see the movie in the company of any children, I am quite sure that this category of moviegoers were absolutely delighted with the movie (and perhaps the very people Lucan had in mind in the movies creation).  In fact, if I had a child, I would rent this movie in a heartbeat for them to have fun watching.  I'm sure they would. Somehow, it is in thought of the children, that I give two stars, and not one.  (or none)<br />For those who are keen on the trilogy, well, I just might even buy the movie for them, partly as a prank, and partly to fire up their creative analytical capacity to further explore how the movie veered or kept in sync with the style of the trilogy.  <br />My instinct, upon first viewing, was that it was completely out of sync with anything associated with what was previously known as Star Wars.  And I was agitated by it.  Frustrated.  I noticed however, that the person I had gone to see the movie with, my father, quite enjoyed the film.  And I realized that he, like many others who enjoyed the trilogy, but are not attached to its atmosphere and style, were precisely the folks, along with children, who may have had the most enjoyable viewing experience.<br />It's interesting to think that a whole new breed of &quot;Star Wars&quot; interest has perhaps been born with this film.  It has been born amidst the camp of moviegoers for whom this might have been their first Star Wars film (as in 6, 7, 8 year olds).  Frightening?  Perhaps.  Interesting? Definitely. What will they think when the see the triolgy, after having been introduced to the Star Wars myth through Episode 1? (!?!)<br />I would watch this movie again, as in a second time, for the same reason that I would give it to a fellow fan of the star wars myth.  Simply to hone my analysis of how the creation and display of this epic veered in this particular path and to see if there exist any possible clues as to why Lucas decided to take this drastic, drastic shift.<br />On a concluding note, I simply missed the architecture and emotion of the trilogy.
B00005TT77|5.0|so good, i want to touch myself in all the wrong places, reincarnating john and now george to join me.
0790733226|5.0|A nearly subliminal image of the &quot;cages&quot; was even managed to be slipped into the movie.  And that is only one of the several very fascinating details of Contact, and the methods in which Sagan's incredible book was translated to film.  <br />There is really so much to rave about, suffice to say the movie is perfect in my perception.  The inclusion of the cages, in such a fantastic glimpse (when she is in space en route to Vega and pausing, looking up), is merely evidence of the profundity of the entire film, and a very edgy creativeness, which surfaces just barely in these glimpses, to expose that the film's perfection is far more than air tight.  It is, in a way, not finished.  There are certain scenes, which move on, logically, naturally, but leave an open page.  And all of this done in such a subtle way.<br />But of course, I recommend this movie, as well as a reading of the book.  After, or before the movie viewing.  I really do not think, in this case, it matters.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Well,  I stumbled upon this album by chance and I am greatful for that one chance.  It`s an incredible album, reminds me how I first listened to Ok Computer.  Just the tremendous experience that awaits afterwards...  I think sonically, it reminds me of old Spirtiualized and early Verve as well as other shoegazer bands, but I think these guys have more to offer.  The soundscapes are amazing and only if I understood the lyrics(I don`t understand their language) I am sure it would be one of the best albums I have listened to.  It can be a task to listen to this album if you are not in the mood, but the funny thing is that by listening to this album, it makes me want to listen to this outside under the stars.
0871137380|4.0|This book is fantastic for a number of reasons. One being that the battle is described in vivid detail. Another being that the author doesn't mess around, for example, when implicating the Italians for possibly tipping off the Somalis in the marketplace that the Americans were coming. That is the kind of stuff that is left out of movies for fear of offending people (and fear of hurting the bottom line - see \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and the Japanese edited version).<br />My only complaint is that the book simply describes the battle and the specific details of what went down. He doesn't step back and attempt to designate who was responsible for the debacle. I realize that was not his purpose but to me it is still an important part of what happened in Somalia...
0140135154|4.0|What do we see when we look?  What makes us look in the first place?  This book from the 1970s is a classic about what makes art and what attracts the eye.<br />It has become a bit outdated, as others have noted -- it is almost 30 years old.  The typography dates the book.  Perhaps it is time for a second edition?<br />The book was based on a BBC tv series.  I can't recall if it had been shown here in the US.  Regardless, it's time for a rerun.
B00005QG9J|3.0|As i counted down the days till the new Incubus cd release I was imagining how great it would be. I figuired it would be like science or make yourself, the two best cd's i've ever heard, but when i picked up their new cd I was bitterly disappointed.  It took a long time to get over their change in style.  Personally I hate that they have changed, they should have stuck with what got them this far. Hard rock was their thing, and now they turn a new leaf and go to soft rock...I dont care how hard rock cirlces is, none of the songs on morning view can come close to the awesomeness of songs such as vitamin, idiot box, a certain shade of green, pardon me, and the list goes on.. I really hope they return to the right path and stay clear of this soft rock [...junk] they are pushing now...AS a huge fan i think it is safe to say STICK WITH THE MUSIC THAT GOT U HERE...FOLLOW SCIENCE AND MAKE YOURSELF..
0446608955|5.0|This book is my favorite book of all time. It's heartwarming, sweet, and of course, very emotional. Most people who see the trailer for the movie will be like, ewww, it Mandy Moore or that looks really good! Well either way read this book! It will make you smile and cry and make you want to change your life. If your totally into love stories, don't pass this by! And, if your not into love stories, still read it! I am going to see the movie the day it comes out. The only thing I wish now is that I was more like Jamie and that somebody will love me as much as Landon did for Jamie. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!

B000007492|5.0|Supertramp was definitely an anomaly in the late 70's musical landscape. They were really too pop to be considered rock, too rock to be considered pure pop, too mainstream to be considered progressive, too quirky and avant garde to be considered mainstream, not quirky and avant garde enough to be considered new wave or punk. And like any great band with a signature sound, they experienced their peak popularity at a time when they were TOTALLY out of place with the predominant music of the time (disco). Now that over 20 years has passed since \\"Breakfast In America\\", we can conveniently classify them as \\"classic rock\\", but they definitely defied categorization in their heyday. Listening to the tracks from \\"Crime of the Century\\", you can definitely sense a jazz and R&B influence woven into their take on progressive rock that made them stand out from the more arty and guitar rock trappings of bands like Genesis, Yes, and King Crimson. Their style evolved over the course of several albums to become something purely their own, a sound which thankfully was never ripped off by a slew of wannabes. One reviewer of BIA classified their sound as almost \\"carnival-like\\", which makes sense even though it's not a conventional description. But then few things about Supertramp were convenitional. From the vocals of Roger Hodgson (the nasal-y voiced one) to the viscous sax of John Halliwel, to the jazzy-staccato electric piano work of Rick Davies (also their other lead vocalist - the deeper voiced one), this was a band that had several distinct trademarks. <br />This collection does indeed copy the running order of the previous best-of \\"Classics Vol. 9\\", but ups the ante three different ways: <br />(1) It adds the track \\"School\\"<BR>(2) It digitally remasters all the songs (\\"Take The Long Way Home\\" in particular sounds absolutely pristine)<BR>(3) it includes the full-length versions of all songs. <br />The anemic \\"Classics Vol 9\\" included shamelessly edited versions of \\"Take The Long Way Home\\" (the intro is what really made the tune cool) and \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", which upset me so much I immediately carted it off to the second-hand CD store. I bet on the fact that a better compilation would come along eventually, and my wish came true. There's hardly a hit missing here. If you're a fan of 70's rock, your collection is incomplete without \\"The Very Best of Supertramp\\"
6305622914|5.0|Characters you care about, a plausibly funny plot, and a film one can relate to and feel good about.  The Full Monty also has something that is hardly seen in films of recent past and that is a comraderie among a group of men that is not brought on by a war or a team sporting event, but by another type urgency; unemployment and lack of self esteem. The male bonding does not go as far as hating women, but only the need of respect from women and from people in general.  The relationship of Robert Carlye's character and the son is genuine, and the lower middle class English town and it's people are atmosheric and very real.
B000002UDG|4.0|My enjoyment of Paul McCartney tunes goes way back. How far back, you ask? Well, some of the earliest pop tunes I recall from my days as a toddler include `Silly Love Songs', `My Love', and `With a Little Luck'. I must've heard one of these tunes at least once on my parents' car's radio every time they drove me either to or from the local pre-school I attended! From those days on, I've always enjoyed his works, both with `Wings' and by himself. I eventually caught on to `Band on the Run', `Live and Let Die', and the duets `Ebony &amp; Ivory' and the lesser-known McCarney/Michael Jackson team-up, `Say Say Say'. Most of the tunes here are good to listen and relax to after a hard day's night (doh!).<br />Although the subsequent `Wingspan' collection includes these tunes &amp; several other Mickey-Cee moments (both Winged &amp; Wingless, like this collection), I didn't care too much for the other songs on it. Don't get me wrong- I like quite a few of his tunes, I'm just not an all-out big-time fan. `All The Best' has all of the tracks I care for, so I don't really feel any need to `trade up'! So if you're a casual fan of this amazing ex-Beatle, then this collection is all you'll ever really need!<br />`Late
B000002KB8|5.0|Black Sabbath is known best for being one of the pioneers of the metal genre. With each album through the 70s, that fact was held true. Their self titled debut album was definitely no exception.<br />From the beginning, Black Sabbath had the right formula: good vocals singing strong lyrics, a varied guitar sound between gloomy and happy, strong bass influence and tight, consistant drumming. Prophesying our doom on vocals was John \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne, who's vocals enhance the mood and fit the songs like a glove. Tony Iommi delivers the guitar grooves in his signature fashion: slow and down-tuned. But these deep tones can't hold a candle to the moment Iommi breaks into a solo. The bass playing of Terence \\"Geezer\\" Butler shines on this album, specifically on the bass solo and N.I.B. Bill Ward provides a raw display of drumming and builds on the gloomy sound.<br />The album starts off with the doom-ladened Black Sabbath, speaking of an encounter with the devil. Very slow song with occassional pick ups in volume. I find the ending to be the best part, where it picks up in speed and has a wild finale. The Wizard sounds like a revved up blues song with interesting lyrics and some nice guitar. Wasp/Behind The Wall Of Sleep/Basically/NIB is a great track because it is long, continuous and constantly changing. Wasp starts off with chord progression and a solo-like piece which leads into the medium paced Behind The Wall Of Sleep. Basically is Geezer's bass solo and he rips it up, using a wah pedal to make it all the more better. The solo leads right into NIB which is one of the best Sabbath tracks ever. Wicked World is a song I enjoy greatly because of the guitar work. From the intro to the verses and from the bridge to the solo, the guitar on this song is awesome. The album ends with A Bit Of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning which is a very cool track, but in my opinion, Wicked World should have been the last song.<br />Since there are only 5 tracks, you can't say that there are any filler tracks. Each song is great and was definitely a step forward in music at the time. Since this is classic metal, metal fans will be pleased. Fans of Sabbath who don't yet have this album need to buy it. This album, along with a few of the earlier albums, defined the band's sound and the direction rock music in general would soon take.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I got this c.d. for Christmas.  It was wonderful!  I immediatly went to track 4 since i knew the song, but listened to the rest.  All the songs are great!  Its upbeat and hot.  I took it to school and all my friends loved it so much that they went out and bought it too.  I give this c.d. 5 stars, two thumbs up, and any other really good rating you can think of.
B00004Z459|5.0|The title of Linkin Park's major label debut, \\"Hybrid Theory\\", released in the Fall of 2000, basically describes their musical style: a hybrid. In this case, the music is a hybrid of rap attitude and the angst of rock/metal. But instead of the same, trash-talking droning of other groups of the rap-rock style (i.e. Limp Bizkit), Linkin Park adds feeling and personal emotion to their lyrics, hitting a nerve with the public. <br />Linkin Park's music is somewhat different from the other rap-rock, even though it has the same basic elements. These elements being the crunchy guitar riffs (played by Brad Delson), drum beats that flow (Rob Bourden) and the turntable scratches (Joe Hahn). But what sets this band apart from the others is the vocals. The rap-infused vocals of Mike Shinoda along with the anger and melody behind the vocals of Chester Bennington and the harmonies between the two intensify the music and its message. With these two presiding over vocals, the band rocks hard and hits home their point.<br />Each track is strong, consistent and diverse from the one before or after it. On certain songs, Shinoda dominates on vocals (In The End) and on others, Bennington is in the front (One Step Closer). Each song is filled with the &quot;nu-metal&quot; waves of power chords on guitar with the other instruments setting the rhythm (on this album, the band did not have a bassist). The only track I dislike is the instrumental &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot;. But after you hear the other 11 tracks, you won't mind it and you'll want more.<br />The album begins with Papercut which is a hard-hitter right off the bat. Cool guitar stuff with the turntables going wild in the background. One Step Closer, their first single, is next and again, its hits hard, especially toward the end. The next 5 tracks, With You, Points Of Authority, Crawling, Runaway, and By Myself are the same formula as the first two. In The End stands out on this album because of its calmness compared to the other tracks. With lyrics shooting straight from the heart and Chester singing with some meaning, this song is definitely one of the best songs from the album. The next two tracks, A Place For My Head and Forgotten, as well as Pushing Me Away are  excellent tracks but, as I said, the instrumental is kinda lame.  <br />The tracks I enjoy most are With You, Points Of Authority, Runaway, By Myself, A Place For My Head and Forgotten. Again, like in other bands, the singles are good songs but they get played too often so you have to look to the rest of the album for pleasure.<br />Linkin Park hit it big in 2001, scoring, I believe, certifications of gold through 5x platinum. They are another band that seems to connect to those people who want to hear them by the lyrics they sing or speak while not necessarily asking us to feel their pain. This is an incredible album from a talented group. They put all they have into their music and their concerts. This is definitely for the fans of rap/rock, &quot;nu-metal&quot; and even  rap/hip-hop in general.
B000001AJG|5.0|This was a terrible movie, but Stevie's soundtrack was his greatest musical accomplishment.
B000002H97|5.0|Released in the summer 1991, this album has been branded many things by Metallica fans (or ex-fans). Its has been called &quot;the beginning of the end for Metallica&quot; while on the other hand being called &quot;the start of something of new&quot;. Whatever it may be, it is definitely something. Something wonderful.<br />Three years after the release of one of the band's most artistically written albums, ...And Justice For All, Metallica began to receive more credit where it was due. They brought themselves into the mainstream and their musically definitely did not fall on deaf ears. A rough but clean metal sound was what Metalica had to offer the 5th time around. But this change of sound and increased popularity turned off some fans, feeling that they had been betrayed.<br />The music is loud, hard and powerfull with less speed than their earlier releases. The songs are shorter as well, and there are not 7 minute plus epics.. This is just in-your-face metal. Leading the band is vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield, whose lyrics have a great deal of pain, sadness and madness while supplying the attitude through the riffs he plays. Again, Hetfield lends his acoustic ability to the album on Unforgiven and Nothing Else Matters. Playing lead is the great Kirk Hammett who can still pump out amazing solos, especially on Enter Sandman. Lars Ulrich's drumming is very good on this album but I prefer the beats of the earlier albums (check out Dyer's Eve). Bass is not too evident on this album but Jason Newsted does get his time to shine on the song My Friend Of Misery. The ending jam to that song is some great work.<br />The highlights of this album are Enter Sandman, Sad But True, Holier Than Thou, Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Nothing Else Matters, Of Wolf And Man, The God That Failed and My Friend Of Misery. Thats 9 out of the 12 tracks. You can't go wrong.<br />Some people feel that Metallica would be a lot better if they had stuck to their thrash metal roots while others don't mind the direction Metallica is taking. I feel that this is definitely a good buy. It is one of Metallica's stronger and more consistent works to date. Fans of the metal scene would be pleased but to the fans of Metallica's first albums who dislike the newer Metallica sound, stay away. This is not for you.
B000002GW5|5.0|Where does one begin to review &quot;Running on Empty&quot;? <br />I wanted this album for years and years. The phrase - running on empty - has been a part of my life since 1977 when the album first came out and believe it or not, I heard the track (and the rest of the album) for the very first time in January 2000 when I finally found the CD in Tower Records, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia!! The CD has been in my car ever since and has never moved from it's No. 1 slot in the 10 CD Changer (The only one I have never removed). I don't think I've ever come home at night in all this time without it playing so loud that the windows shake! This is a masterpiece! Plain and simple. the title track is one of the most outstanding pieces of work in all the rock I have heard (and I've heard lots). One reviewer here said he didn't like it. If he isn't deaf he is most certainly tone deaf. What a song! What an absolutely impossibly amazing song! Rolling on to The Road, Rosie, You Love the Thunder, Cocaine (though competing against Cale's classic is a tough ask) Love Needs a Heart and finally to the downright thunderously spectacular Load Out/ Stay medley with it's 3 time signature changes, Bonnie Raitt on backing vocal... and you're hitting the reload button to play the whole album over again. <br />Months on the road tightens the sound of any band, and Jackson Browne's backing men (and women) are so tight they absolutely hum!  The only other - on the road - album that occupies the same space as this one is - Frampton Comes Alive! (in my humble opinion).<br />Running On Empty is still my only Jackson Browne album. A flaw I have recently corrected by buying 5 more on Amazon!<br />Buy this album! If you don't like it, I'll pay for it.
6304308388|5.0|I watched this movie recently on VHS and I loved it! Jack Lemmon gave a geniune feel as C.C. Baxter; Shirley McLaine was great as Fran Kulblick (She should've won an Oscar for her &quot;crying&quot; portrayal in the movie); and I was surprised about Fred McMurray on how he portrayed his character, J.D. Sheldrake, as a villian so well. All three, plus Joan Shawlee and Ray Walston, made this movie so entertaining to watch. I also enjoyed seeing the time capsule parts in this movie (i.e. the steno equipments) and the part where C.C. Baxter met Mrs. McDougall in the bar (&quot;What is Castro?&quot; &quot;The man from Havana with the crazy beard&quot;). This movie is NOT one to miss! :) You will enjoy it as much as I did!
B00000JPH5|4.0|David Bowie allowed to go over the top (but fortunately staying a tiny bit restrained)...<br />Jennifer Connelly (beautiful, a little whining, though the plot requires it of her; from her pre-R days)...<br />Muppets galore, doing their thing...<br />Great tunes, that fit the movie...<br />Worth watching a couple times.
0783235607|5.0|VARIOUS OBSERVATIONS<br /> * Psycho is a nightmare film. Not because it is scary - because it isn't particularly frightening. It is deeply unsettling, perhaps, more than scary. ''The Birds'' left me in shivers; this one only left me with deep elusive emotions and the memory of Norman's maniacal, psychotic smile at the close of the film, an image which almost twelve hours later has not left me. Any more than has ''Mother's'' voice. I suppose this film is a study: a disturbing, but true look into the human nature. We all could be psycho killers if we had been in his place, and although we cringe at the horror and sickness of Norman's twisted mind and split personality, we find it hard to despise him. <br /> * Norman Bates looks at first glance as innocent as anyone - he is really quite ordinary. Who would suspect he is a maniac scizophrenic? After all, practically anyone can acquire the aggravating habit of continuous candy corn consumption, or be twittery and stuttering, or look creepy in certain lights. But the moment the illumined ''Bates Motel'' sign comes into view through the weeping night, it is an edgy feeling that crawls over the viewer. But why? The cabins are no different from many others; in fact they are quite charming. Still, a peculiar air seems to be pervading the place, an air of dread, uncertainty and darkness. Not only the darkness of the hour, but of the mind. Perhaps it is the old house that stands guard of the cabins which is so menacing; perhaps she is protective of them. She looks as though she could reach out and destroy anything which threatened the solitude and silence of those twelve vacancies.<br /> * Mother's room is heavy, oppressive in its ornateness and antiquity. The imprint she left on the bed direct's one's mind - rather unsettlingly - to the thought of those plaster casts made from the hollows left by the victims of Pompeii. Trapped for years, perhaps, leaving a mark that will take many more years to efface. Norman's room is suggestive of the child he still is. His life as Norman ended at five, after all. When did he have a chance to grow up? At five his father died, and Norman began his long slow descent into madness. His toys have never been taken out of the place. The record in the player is Beethoven's ''Eroica'': powerful music, almost light at times, frightfully aggressive at other moments. The motive goes in circles, first loudly, then softly, sometimes overlapping, never really reaching a resolution until the slamming close.<br /> * Mother Bates herself isn't all that frightening. I expect we are too desensitised by this time - after all, one see hundreds of such masks and worse at Hallowe'en time. No matter how revolting they may be, such things no longer frighten us as they would have done the general public in 1960. Lila touches her shoulder; the corpse turns about - eyeless, all smile and teeth and grey hair and shawl. When Norman comes in, looking ridiculous and far too tall in Mother's dressing-gown and wig, and is taken over by Sam, Mother rocks peacefully, the eternal smile fixed. The light bulb as it swings gives a weird shadow effect. Where Mother's eyes should be, the shadows play back and forth as if she is glancing from side to side - laughing at what she sees, laughing at the destruction she has helped to create.<br /> * I would say everyone should see this film at least once, for the experience. It is well-done and thought-provoking, with much more depth than the cheap horror flicks of today. This is a real situation, this could actually happen (only let's hope not very much). I know a Bates Motel. I've never been in it. Perhaps someday I'll go check it out, but I think I'll stay out of the shower.
0380730367|5.0|MY FAVORITE OF THE FIVE IN THE SERIES!

B00005JKQX|5.0|I walked into the theatre of &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; knowing only that it was about a math genius, John Nash, whose level of genius flirts with madness.  How closely intwined are the two?<br />I don't have much experience with psychological thrillers, but this movie threw me for a loop at every twist and bend.  By the end I didn't know who was what, or if anything was real.  The two hours felt more like ten years as I tried to grasp the mental capacities and problems of a man, watching fifty years of his life flit before my lives.  Russell Crowe's acting is (once again) brilliant, perfectly depicting the tortured Nash, and rightfully earning him a few nominations for various film awards.<br />What a ride this movie is.  I highly recommend it to most anyone...but if you're really bordering on mental insanity yourself, you might want to steer clear.  It could push you over the edge.  ^_~
B000022TT4|5.0|I've been a fan for years, making the track to the midnight movies years ago to see Rattle and Hum in the theatrical release.  But the sound quality of the DVD blows everything else away!  This DVD alone is reason enough to go out and purchase a player.  If you are a fan of U2 this DVD will be nothing short of a religious experience!
0780629450|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I had never even read the book before.  After watching the film I had to read the book and I was surprised that there was very little difference between the book and the movie.  I was pleased that Kenneth Branagh had said all of his lines and he actually said them with such great feeling that you would never get anywhere else.  The movie followed the book very well except for the fact that Shakespeare orginally had the time period set in the 1200s where this version of the film is set more along the 1800s.  It's a strange difference but I didn't let that get in the way of enjoying it.<br />I've seen other versions of the play but this one is by far the best.  Even the big hollywood actors with the smaller parts (J. Lemmon, R. Williams, B. Crystal, & C. Heston) did a superb job with their characters.  I have to recommend this title for all Shakespeare fans or anyone who just wants to see a great movie.

B00005QW5X|4.0|Meet Hans, an East Berlin teenager desperate to escape the communist block who undergoes a botched sex change operation in order to marry an American military man and flee to the free world.  Now meet Hedwig, the rock-em-shock-em punk band leader into which Hans transforms himself when his American husband abandons him in the midwest.  Embittered when the Berlin wall falls and furious when a later teenage-lover steals her music and becomes an arena-filling rock star, Hedwig now dogs the teenager's steps by staging a tour with her own band and following him from town to town.<br />John Cameron Mitchell, who co-wrote and starred in the New York show and who appears in the film as both director and star, mutes the more savage tones of the material in favor of pathos and a broader sense of the character's humanity; consequently, the film isn't really as far-out or edgy as it might seem, so it lacks the sharp bite you might expect.  The film also seems a bit unfocused, a bit unstructured, and at times I felt a bit frustrated by what it leads you to expect but never actually delivers.  Even so, Mitchell and company (especially Miriam Shor), give some extremely interesting and often drop-dead funny performances, and the music performed by the band as it tours is first rate throughout.<br />Sadly, some viewers will reject the film without seeing it on the basis of subject matter alone--which would be a mistake.  Often funny, often touching, and certainly thought-provoking, HEDWIG packs a solid punch by appealing to the untapped creativity in all of us and leads us to question our own internal sense of unity.  The characters and ideas it presents linger in mind afterward, and while Hedwig and her angry inch aren't quite as knock-out as you could wish they're still fascinating.<br />The DVD contains lots of extras, most notably a documentary (almost as long as the movie itself) that describes the creation of both stage show and film.  The footage of the New York show is particularly fascinating.cularly fascinating.

B0000062GE|5.0|Stabbing Westward is, without a doubt, one of the best bands currently making music today.  While their fourth album doesn't have the bite of this album, it still carries the basic foundations of what Stabbing Westward is all about.  The foundations of their music are expressed brilliantly in their third release, Darkest Days.<br />Singer Christopher Hall has said time and again that this is a concept album.  Also of note is that this is the only SW album that contains more than ten tracks.  Regardless, it is a brilliant body of work, and their second best release, behind Wither, Blister, Burn and Peel.<br />Stabbing Westward has always had a flair for creating fantastic opening tracks.  &quot;Darkest Days,&quot; the opening title track to this album, is no exception.  I still get shivers down my spine when listening to Walter Flakus' opening sample.<br />The band's music also grows more complex on this release.  While their previous album relied more on creating music over a silence that permeates throught the disc, this album focuses more on creating layers of sound, all on top of one another.  The best example of this is &quot;Drugstore,&quot; my favorite song on the album.  It combines tribal beats, eerie samples, and some of the finest bass work on the entire album from Jim Sellers.<br />As I state before, this is definitely a concept album.  Most of the songs on this release don't stand out on their own, but when taken as part of a whole composition, they are masterpieces.  If you are new to Stabbing Westward, give Wither... a listen first.  The music on that release is SW at its most raw and powerful.  If you like that one, then this one will definitely blow you away.

B00005QK3B|2.0|I read and studied reviews of Marillion both here and in the newsgroups, resulting in particularly high expectations of the quality this relase.  After deciding that this had to be a no-lose purchase, I orded the CD. I waited with eager anticipation to be blown away by the music, the vocals, the arrantements....only to be boringly disappointed by the complete plack of originality of this band.  <br />I can only guess that Mr Fish admired Peter Gabriel, and most likely intended to pay homage with this release.  But....come on now - this is Gabriel/Genesis, but without the life, the spirit, the talent and the originality.  If I had not lived listening to and seeing performances by the masters King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Gentle Giant from '72 to the present (Crimson's current releases e.g. Heavy Construktion, is still many light years better than anything that the current set of neo-Prog wannabes can even imagine to write or perform) then I would image that this music could be touching.  But alas.....to no avail.<br />The Underground Railroad and Stoit/Flower Kings are much better investments of time and $$ for someone who would like to listen to the best and most original/creative ensembles currently around.

B00005QDW5|1.0|It has some good tracks, but none of it flows! I feel like I am listening to a burn every time I pop it in. Plus my two favorite albums (\\"More\\" and \\"Obscured By Clouds\\") have no recognition with Echoes, which is a bummer. Most of what you hear you can easily listen to on the radio... If you want \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" go ahead and get this junk. If you want \\"Cymbaline\\" or \\"Mudmen,\\" then I see where you stand. Echoes gives no justice to Pink Floyd whatsoever. They give it a new identity. Pink Floyd is supposed to be slightly different in every release. This just jumbles everything up in an ugly mess...<br />I am just happy they were wise to include \\"Fletcher Memorial Home\\" and \\"Bike.\\" Although maybe this wasn't a good move because all these garbage-consuming people want is Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall. I like both albums, but I certainly believe there is more to Pink Floyd than just that.
B0000009RT|4.0|The Mother's first album is great as everyone who has heard it knows, but the transfer to CD could have been much better. Compared to the original vinyl version, the sound is uneven. Frank's guitar is so much more prominent on the vinyl version of Hungry Freaks, Daddy, for example. Some songs sound as good as on the vinyl, but others do not. But then, I think the original master tape of the album was in poor condition to begin with, thanks to Verve-MGM's storage of it in a warehouse or somewhere. It would be nice to get a remastered and remixed version of &quot;Freak Out!&quot; for all to enjoy.
068817776X|5.0|Throughout time, different cultures and groups of people have had varied ideas on what makes a hero. In Edith Hahn Beer's autobiography, The Nazi Officer's Wife, she tells what it was like to be the wife of a Nazi officer-and a Jewish woman with false identity papers at the same time. Some people have criticized Hahn for the manner in which she survived the Holocaust, by being married to the enemy while other Jews were dying in the Nazi concentration camps. Her inspiring autobiography, definitely worth reading, makes the reader admire in stead of criticize her. It tells the story of a young, afraid, hunted Jew living in Nazi Austria who overcomes adversity to become strong willed and brave, helpful to others, and hard working. These qualities are those of  heroes, and are reasons why Edith Hahn Beer should be considered a hero or heroine. <BR>One heroic quality that Edith demonstrates is that of her bravery and strong will. She remained cool when Nazi officers questioned her parent's lineage during her marriage ceremony. This is important because when she filed for her marriage to Werner Vetter, her papers had her registered as Grete Denner, a Christian. If the government had found out about this, the lives of both Edith and Christl Denner (the original owner of the papers) would be in jeopardy. Another brave thing that Edith does is listen to the BBC, and other foreign radio stations. This is a brave thing to do, because \\"Anybody who [listens to foreign radio stations] will go to Dachau or Buchenwald or Orianenburg or God only knows where.\\" Finally, one major thing Edith does to demonstrate her amazing self control and bravery is to give birth to her daughter without any anesthetic. After working as  Reich nurse, she had discovered that people giving birth had said all kinds of things that could get them in trouble with the government. \\"I began to remember all the patients I had seen who had come out of surgery or had been sedated during childbirth, and who said things that could incriminate them and their loved ones.\\" After she is done, she goes on to say that in all of World War II,  giving birth to her daughter was the only part in the war where she wanted to die. Going through this much pain to protect the people you love is quite heroic.<BR>Throughout the course of the book, Edith proves herself to be very concerned about other people. She helps others even when it is potentially dangerous to her own self. In the beginning of the book, she becomes a nanny and tutor to a young woman named Christl Denner. As time goes by, Denner becomes like a little sister to Edith. Edith's mother goes on to say \\"When [Mr. Denner's] girls needed a substitute mother, someone to listen to them with a caring heart, you were there.\\" The fact that Edith befriends Denner as a youth is crucial. Years later, Denner saves Edith's life. Christian Christl let Edith use her original identity papers, and reapplied for a set for herself. With these Christian papers, Edith could then function as an Aryan woman in Nazi Austria. Edith even helps complete strangers. A Nazi officer knocks on her door and says \\"... We have reason to believe there is a deserter hiding out in the vacant apartment.... Right above you. He would have been here last night. Did you hear any noise?\\" Even though she had heard footsteps, shuffling, and a creaking bed among other noises, she lied and said \\"No, Nothing.\\" This act saved a complete stranger. If the government had found out that she lied about this, her whole cover as an Aryan housewife could have been blown.  Finally, post war, Edith works shortly as a judge. People come to her requesting emigration papers, with custody battles, and with cases involving impoverished Russian children. She takes all these cases saying \\"Finally it was my turn to save someone's life.\\" At the end of World War II, non-Aryan judges with proper credentials were in high demand. These people that Edith Hahn was among helped to restore order to thechaos that post-war Europe had become. <BR> Finally, one last heroic quality found to be true to Edith Hahn Beer is that of her hard work and determination. Throughout the course of the war, she is forced to work in at least 2 places: an asparagus plantation in Osterburg, and a factory in Aschersleben. At the asparagus plantation, her fingers \\"ached as though they were broken\\" and her back \\"would not straighten,\\" yet she was still considered one of the plantation's best working. Her hard work was important here, because it showed her inner drive. Even though this was something she wasn't exactly thrilled to be doing, she was still doing her best at it. Life was similar at the factory in Aschersleben. There, she helped cut boxes. Her planning and pacing resulted in having her quota raised twice. A good friend, Mina, went on to say \\"You are clearly one of `Bestehorn's best'!\\" Hard work was important here for the same reasons that it was in Osterburg. As long as Edith was working for the government, she and her family were safe and in the Reich. Edith lastly proves her inner drive and hard work by crepe making. With the end of the war, Bradenburg (the city in which she lived) fell to the Russians. She evacuated with her young, measles stricken daughter, to a nearby city. There, she lived briefly with a farming family and soldiers, all going hungry. She told everyone to go to nearby farmers and bring back milk, eggs, jam, bread, and flour for Crepes. \\"All day long, as the men streamed into the little house, I made hundreds of delicate Viennese crepes for the Wehrmacht [German for armed forces] and the woman and her daughter served them.\\" This gesture not only represented her willingness to help others, but her hard work helped to feed these starving German soldiers. Since this occurred post-war, this also represents her making amends with the German armed forces, once considered enemies. At the end of the war, she saw that many of them were just tired, beaten down, hungry men and this gesture of her hard work shows that. <BR>There are many different kinds of heroes. There are political heroes, battle heroes, heroes who are innovators. Edith Hahn was none of the above. What made Edith Hahn Beer a hero was not one single deed, or necessarily one big achievement. Her persona, willingness to help others, bravery in hard times and her hard work left footprints in the hearts of those around her, and continues to touch those who read her autobiography. That is what makes Edith Hahn Beer a hero.
B00005RFVL|5.0|I love Robbie.  I love his stuff.  But what was great on this album were the duets that he did.  I was extremely impressed by his duet with Nicole Kidman.  I was sceptical, but she really nails it.  I also like the ones with Rupert Everett and other friends.  I bought it last month through the Amazon UK site when I heard it was at the top of the charts in the UK.  <br />There is a whole &quot;Rat Pack&quot; feel to the album, so it is appropriate that he dedicates it to Frank, Dean, and Sammy.<br />The album was inspired by his Miss Jones contribution to the Bridgette Joneses Diary film.
068817776X|5.0|Throughout time, different cultures and groups of people have had varied ideas on what makes a hero. In Edith Hahn Beer's autobiography, The Nazi Officer's Wife, she tells what it was like to be the wife of a Nazi officer-and a Jewish woman with false identity papers at the same time. Some people have criticized Hahn for the manner in which she survived the Holocaust, by being married to the enemy while other Jews were dying in the Nazi concentration camps. Her inspiring autobiography, definitely worth reading, makes the reader admire in stead of criticize her. It tells the story of a young, afraid, hunted Jew living in Nazi Austria who overcomes adversity to become strong willed and brave, helpful to others, and hard working. These qualities are those of  heroes, and are reasons why Edith Hahn Beer should be considered a hero or heroine. <BR>One heroic quality that Edith demonstrates is that of her bravery and strong will. She remained cool when Nazi officers questioned her parent's lineage during her marriage ceremony. This is important because when she filed for her marriage to Werner Vetter, her papers had her registered as Grete Denner, a Christian. If the government had found out about this, the lives of both Edith and Christl Denner (the original owner of the papers) would be in jeopardy. Another brave thing that Edith does is listen to the BBC, and other foreign radio stations. This is a brave thing to do, because \\"Anybody who [listens to foreign radio stations] will go to Dachau or Buchenwald or Orianenburg or God only knows where.\\" Finally, one major thing Edith does to demonstrate her amazing self control and bravery is to give birth to her daughter without any anesthetic. After working as  Reich nurse, she had discovered that people giving birth had said all kinds of things that could get them in trouble with the government. \\"I began to remember all the patients I had seen who had come out of surgery or had been sedated during childbirth, and who said things that could incriminate them and their loved ones.\\" After she is done, she goes on to say that in all of World War II,  giving birth to her daughter was the only part in the war where she wanted to die. Going through this much pain to protect the people you love is quite heroic.<BR>Throughout the course of the book, Edith proves herself to be very concerned about other people. She helps others even when it is potentially dangerous to her own self. In the beginning of the book, she becomes a nanny and tutor to a young woman named Christl Denner. As time goes by, Denner becomes like a little sister to Edith. Edith's mother goes on to say \\"When [Mr. Denner's] girls needed a substitute mother, someone to listen to them with a caring heart, you were there.\\" The fact that Edith befriends Denner as a youth is crucial. Years later, Denner saves Edith's life. Christian Christl let Edith use her original identity papers, and reapplied for a set for herself. With these Christian papers, Edith could then function as an Aryan woman in Nazi Austria. Edith even helps complete strangers. A Nazi officer knocks on her door and says \\"... We have reason to believe there is a deserter hiding out in the vacant apartment.... Right above you. He would have been here last night. Did you hear any noise?\\" Even though she had heard footsteps, shuffling, and a creaking bed among other noises, she lied and said \\"No, Nothing.\\" This act saved a complete stranger. If the government had found out that she lied about this, her whole cover as an Aryan housewife could have been blown.  Finally, post war, Edith works shortly as a judge. People come to her requesting emigration papers, with custody battles, and with cases involving impoverished Russian children. She takes all these cases saying \\"Finally it was my turn to save someone's life.\\" At the end of World War II, non-Aryan judges with proper credentials were in high demand. These people that Edith Hahn was among helped to restore order to thechaos that post-war Europe had become. <BR> Finally, one last heroic quality found to be true to Edith Hahn Beer is that of her hard work and determination. Throughout the course of the war, she is forced to work in at least 2 places: an asparagus plantation in Osterburg, and a factory in Aschersleben. At the asparagus plantation, her fingers \\"ached as though they were broken\\" and her back \\"would not straighten,\\" yet she was still considered one of the plantation's best working.

B00005NNU4|4.0|Alright, so it's been six years since TTD's last cd, and like all talented artists he has changed his name. Often compared to Prince, TTD has proven on each successive cd that he will not derail his career with self-indulgence like Prince has in the past 5 years. In fact, &quot;Wildcard&quot; continues to show growth and originality. TTD has always used rock, r&amp;b, jazz and blended them into something of his own. &quot;Wildcard&quot; adds some drum and bass, funk, Parisian accordian, and whatever else was handy to come up with some amazing results. I had to listen to &quot;Wildcard&quot; many times to hear all the musical and lyrical nuances and to really enjoy this cd. Still, I will be critical as well as praiseworthy. I do have all five of TTD's cds and I can't admit that &quot;Wildcard&quot; is better than 1993's &quot;Symphony Or Damn&quot;. I just can't do it. However, the strengths on &quot;Wildcard&quot; are as follows, in my opinion: &quot;O Divina&quot; with its Motown influences, &quot;Designated Fool&quot; with its electro-funk feel, &quot;My Dark Places&quot;, which has the great lyric: &quot;Since we're parking in each others places, won't you be with me in my dark places&quot; (Classic D'arby line), &quot;The Inner Scream&quot; with its commentary that if you don't let your anger out it can become a disease, &quot;Drivin' Me Crazy&quot; with its catchy drum and bass rhythm, &quot;Suga Free&quot; (in the vein of Supermodel Sandwich) with it's humorous line &quot;Sweet tooth is missing a cavity&quot;--also this song has an unusual electro-funk-operatic quality, &quot;Ev'rythang&quot; is a good ballad, &quot;Sweetness&quot; is a moving hip hop/r&amp;b flavored song, my favorite song is &quot;Be Willing&quot; with its positive message of finding happiness in life, &quot;Goodbye Diane&quot; with its unique rock and roll sound with unusual chorus, &quot;...And They Will Never Know&quot; with its stop and start rock and roll, &quot;Sayin' About You&quot; has that classic 70's r&amp;b sound, &quot;Shadows&quot; with its Parisian accordian is an unusual twist near the end of the cd, and last but not least &quot;Testify&quot;, the bonus track, is a solid closing statement about taking a stand on love. The songs I think could have been excised are the bizarre and pointless &quot;SRR-636&quot;, the boring &quot;Shalom&quot; and &quot;Love Can You Hear Me?&quot; the repetitive &quot;Reflecting&quot; and &quot;Benediction: Sugar Ray&quot;. It is these weaknesses, and the fact that TTD has already suprised us with &quot;Symphony Or Damn&quot; and &quot;Vibrator&quot;, so the uniqueness of &quot;Wildcard&quot; comes as no suprise, that I am giving &quot;Wildcard&quot; four stars instead of five. Still, TTD is one of a few artists that can pull off a 19 track cd with little complaint from me. TTD fans will be satisfied with &quot;Wildcard&quot; but today's radio audience, the kiddies watching MTV, they won't get TTD, and that's a shame, because TTD has just as much musical legitimacy as Lenny Kravitz, Prince, Macy Gray, Alicia Keys, Aria Arie, R. Kelly, Brian McKnight, Wyclef Jean, Lauren Hill, etc. I believe TTD offers a wider range of sounds and often times more poetic words than many of those artists. Now, if TTD could just put out music more often than every four to six years!as that classic 70's r&amp;b sound, &quot;Shadows&quot; with its Parisian accordian is an unusual twist near the end of the cd, and last but not least &quot;Testify&quot;, the bonus track, is a solid closing statement about taking a stand on love.

0788812807|5.0|They sure don't make their films like they used to. Nowdays disneys has the voices for the films in the end credits and the not the first. And pretty much the old films, don't have very much end credits. Just to the end of a story and says &quot;and they lived happily ever after.&quot; That depends on who they are in a film, like a prince and a princess or in this case, two dogs, a house dog and a stray dog (which goes to Lady &amp; the Tramp). I'm not sure if Mr. Disney wanted films to go out of stock for a long time. But this just like Emperor's Ne Groove is a short film, this runs 76 minutes long. And I'm sure that all of you know that Mr. Disney died of lung cancer in the mid 1960's. I enjoy this film because it is an animated movie. And I think this should be in everybody's collection of disney animated movies.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Some Movies are good because maybe they have a good story, or because they're entertaining, or they have good action. But it's been a long time (if ever) that I've seen a movie that challenged me and made me think about life like American Beauty (AB) has, and that's why I regard AB the best movie ever. I just saw it for the 2nd time on DVD, and it's message is just as profound and challenging as ever.<br />Middle-aged man has mid-life crisis where he starts to question everything about his life, his material accomplishments, the BIG question. He is confronted by a materialistic wife, and a young and insecure but intelligent daughter. Against this backdrop moves in his neighbors, a military man with violent and rascist undertones, and his teenage son who appears more mature than his age.<br />In Lester's world where everyone is a bit wacky and has their own deep problems, the Neighbor's son, Ricky, appears to be the only person &quot;who is with it&quot;, and yet, he's a young lad peddling weed.<br />The message? There is beauty in the world, there's beauty all around us, all we have to do is stop chasing the chase, relax and  be able to see the beauty that already exists around us. Like Lester Burnham says at the end, &quot;you probably have no idea what I am talking about I'm sure. But don't worry, you will someday.&quot;<br />Do yourself a favour, rent this movie and see it for yourself. You won't regret it.
B00005K3O4|1.0|This movie rates up there with Pumpkinhead and King Solomon's Mines starring Richard Chamberlain as one of the worst movies of all time.  Two reasons why I purchased it.  One, I got it for $.... Two, the review from Amazon.com.  In the future, I guarantee I'll get a more reliable review before purchase.  Don't waste your time!  If you want scary, get the original Dracula or any Hammer Studios film.  If you want camp, try Fiend Without a Face or Black Sunday with Barbara Steele.
0790734850|4.0|If you like cops and robbers, detective stories, Columbo style, with good acting and great sets, you'll like LA Confidential.<br />Story of 3 cops, in a corrupt LA department, with Hollywood at it's prime as the backdrop. Great acting primarily by Russell Crowe, Guy Perce, Kevin Spacey, and Kim Basinger makes the movie especially enjoyeable.<br />An interesting performance by Russell Crowe in his pre-gladiator roles, shows this guy is a real actor, not another hunk. The acting alone is worth watching.
0316777722|5.0|The first half of the book is good reading if you appreciate the absurdities of life.  If you struggled to fit in (or struggled keep from it), you will appreciate his scenarios.  <BR>The second half is brilliantly funny.  His experiences with the French language had me in tears and gasping for breath.  <BR>Even as a straight, married, parent of two young children, I can identify with (and laugh at) what the author goes through.
078324228X|3.0|For a movie that was well praised by critics, I was sort of expecting more. Not that it was bad or anything, but the story was predictable, and nothing in it was surprising.<br />I generally agree that Denzel Washington's acting was good, but at times, I felt his character remained aloof. In the end, I didn't warm up to Rubin Carter as a person, but was I supposed to?<br />Basically, the movie is a good portrayal of Rubin Carter, his career, his incarceration, chronicling how his Canadian friends stayed by his side and helped freed him. I seem to not have much to say about the movie ... perhaps that says enough, I liked it, but didn't think it was that great.
B00000K0DK|5.0|First, the fact that when middle aged boomers like myself were in school, the one thing we probably all knew about Orson Welles was his 1938 Radio Show WAR OF THE WORLDS, and his movie career was a very secondary thing. CITIZEN KANE is probably the most written about (see the late Pauline Kael's famous piece etc.) movie ever, but many have still not seen it,even after the mid-1980's video era began. It was rarely on TV before then. Notice the handling of the young boy with his mother in the snow storm,and his being told he'll be rich, and moving on to better things with his new guardian, and the boy's sadness,and losing the sled. Right from the start, Lord Acton's comment &quot;Money corrupts absolutely&quot;, one of the great themes thruout this incredible feast of a movie. We all know it was Welles' first chance to do his own movie, and,like Mozart, he proved himself a Boy Wonder!! The shots and narration of the &quot;Castle&quot; with all the animals. This too is a wondrous scene, but they continue all the way thru....ending only in the final scene of the fires burning and the sled marked by the famous name, the utterance of the great,but defeated, man on his death bed. All he really wanted was the innocence of youth, as the middle of the film shows his slow decline and corruption. At least that's my take on it...Other great short scenes include Kane meeting with Hitler, Mussolini (I think..I have not scene this for years, and am writing this strictly from memory.) etc. The growth of the newspaper empire is beautifully done too...Obviously, the lighting and cinematography is perfection all the way,as is the make-up and aging of Orson's own portrayal,ie from a young man to a senior,maybe 50 years of Kane's life...The only weak spot IMHO are the operatic scenes where his second wife squeals away, cheap shots at Hearst and Marion Davies..And there's the dinner table scenes with his first wife,perfectly showing the deterioration of a marriage,as they slowly begin toignore each other (too familiar for many of us probably). Anything and everything by Welles has at least a stroke of genius, and CITIZEN KANE is one long stroke. After this don't miss the rare LADY FROM SHANGHAI,and MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS. The others are all great in that special Wellesian way, but these three are the top. And don't miss THE THIRD MAN ,based on Graham Greene's classic story of post-war Vienna, with Welles really stealing the show as a scoundrel of the worst kind!!
B00003CWTI|5.0|This is a long movie, but watching it didn't seem long, because of the masterful way the director has weaved the various human stories. The acting was great at all levels. The ending was a bit unbelievable but nevertheless did not take away from the power of this movie.<br />I won't repeat other reviewer's comments, but basically this movie is several stories rolled into one. For me, I found the main theme running through was &quot;pain&quot;, pain between father and son, pain between daughter and father, pain between relationships lost, pain in our everyday human lifes. This pain often runs deep, and may never heal. The human condition is fragile and lives with such pain all the time. Occasionally, that pain is lifted and gives rise to optimism. <br />It's the way the director has compiled so many stories into one, dealing with the human condition, that makes this movie so powerful. When the pain is shown, it's intense.<br />This movie will stay with you for a long-time.
B0000024RZ|3.0|FREEWHEELIN,the earlier release, is for sure the best early Bob, and probably the best of any. It is amazing that he did some novel things at such a young age, better than his later efforts. Still, listening to TIMES THEY ARE A CHANGIN in 2002, much sounds really dated, especially the title track,along with &quot;My Generation&quot;, a real generation divider way back when. Now, the generation that these guys liked to condemn is called the GREATEST GENERATION, and if Bob and the Who still do these live, it would really seem ridiculous. Hopefully, they spare the audience. &quot;With God on our Side&quot; has always been a folk favorite for me, but it's message too is timeworn today. And there's no humor here,a staple of much early Dylan,which always kept Bob's albums from being too self-conscious, and preachy. Still, most of these have an intimate, heartfelt touch, and his quiet vocals make listening reasonable, if not always enjoyable...All in all, pretty good coming from a 22 year old, even if it doesn't always hold up after so many years.
B00000JPH4|5.0|This tale follows the spiritual coming of age storyline.  Its struggle of good verses evil leaves me enchanted.  <BR>The puppet master, Jim Henson, brings this world to life and leave me longing to jump into the television &amp; share the adventures of Jen.<BR>I have watched this film since I was a child &amp; will continue to watch it over &amp; over &amp; over.  No child or adult should resist losing themselves in this world.  <BR>A beautiful, mysterious masterpiece.
B00005O3VC|5.0|this is onbe of the greatest comedy's ever fimed, this shows that you can make a funny movie with a very tight budget, i believe it takes real talent to make a movie like this, and this movie will stand as one of the great comedy's for generations and generations of humans.
B000000OEI|5.0|The power that this score has can simply not be put into words. This score contains some of the most mysterious, nervous, beautiful music that has ever graced a film. Zimmer perfectly matched the musical style on this score with the theme of the movie. Just listening to this album takes you on a deep journey to the depths of the sea and then surfaces you again to reality. In my personal opinion this is Zimmers best work, followed by Broken Arrow and The Rock. If you are a electronic music fan or a film score / Hans Zimmer fanatic...you cannot live without this masterpiece of musical perfection.
B00005JKT8|4.0|Anyone who has enjoyed reading fairy tales as a kid or who misses &quot;the good old days&quot; will love this movie. It stars the amazing Hugh Jackman as Leopold, the Duke of Albany, and inventor of the elevator. Hugh Jackman does a smashing job... dashing his way into the hearts of his female viewers and invoking serious jealousy in the hearts of men.<br />Seriously though, the character of Leopold has something to teach of respect and integrity... not to mention, does a pretty good job of blueprinting the mind of a genius. The movie does an excellent job of contrasting the rat race of everyday life in modern day New York with the turn of the century Victorian New England. Lack of development of the main female character (played respectably by Meg Ryan) as well as too much action in the beginning of the movie and a short ending are really it's only shortcomings. (Oh and I must add, what was costume thinking in regards to Kate?!)<br />If it's been too long since you've said, &quot;awwww&quot;, laughed until your side hurts, or if you've forgotten the virtues of mankind and la dolce vita, you need to see this movie! A little history, a little romance, and a great heaping dollop of laughter make this a great one to see (and buy)!
630463949X|5.0|This is my first music video DVD, and I love it! Fleetwood Mac has always had an intensity, and it's really just captured perfectly here on DVD. I have The Dance on CD and VHS and in my opinion it doesnt compare to the DVD. I noticed during the ending of &quot;Gypsy&quot; (which was an incredible performance) Lindsey's guitar playing was very much more prominant. You can really hear the individual musical sounds of each instrument here, and the vocals are much better, someone mentioned them not ben n sync with the picture, thats not the case on the DVD i have, definetely worth your money! I love Stevie, and Fleetwood Mac and this captures them in their finest.
B000002UV1|5.0|&quot;Mother's Milk&quot; is the first great peppers album. They really hit thier stride on this album, giving us a sign of things to come. This album does no rank as high as &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; or &quot;Californication&quot; but it does stand on it's own. The highlights on this album are: &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, &quot;Subway to Venus&quot;, &quot;Magic Johnson&quot;, &quot;Knock me Down&quot;, &quot;Stone Cold Bush&quot; and &quot;Johnny Kick a Hole in the Sky&quot;. Needless to say this album is pretty damn good. This was the perppers first album with guitarist John Frusciante and he is the perfect choice for this band, Flea's bass isn't as prominent on this album as it has been on thier newer albums but it does take center stage on a few tracks. I love Kieidis' vocals on this album, he shines on all of the tracks, especially &quot;Magic Johnson&quot;. This was also the peppers first album with drummer Chad Smith and he couldn't be better, his outstanding work is all over this album. For Peppers fans this album is a must, and even non peppers fans will like this album, pick it up.
630542845X|5.0|Personally I thought it an excellent movie.  It is one of the very few movies I have watched more than once.  It was moving and sentimental and thought provoking.  I have bought several copies to share with friends.
B000003N7G|5.0|I held off buying this album, which runs about 40 minutes in length, in favor of longer albums by other artists so I could get &quot;more for my money.&quot; I could'nt have been more wrong.<br />This album is worth its weight in gold. Beautiful, uplifting, words can barely describe it. The rythmns and technical ability of Coltrane &amp; Co. is ear-bending and mind-boggling. Sometimes simple rythmns and note combinations make for beautiful music, but Coltrane's hymn is a complex woven tapestry that should please your senses and warm your heart. I love the insert as well -- Coltrane's poetry matches the best of David's Psalms. That's a strong assertion, but one that I think many would back up.
B000001E7L|5.0|To start of this has to be one of the all time best cd's every made.  This cd [is really good], there is only one lil' bit of cranberries that I dont like and it can be fixed Delores O'Riordan's lyrics, dont get Me wrong she has one of the most beautiful voice's in all of music, but here lyrics can be a lil' childish.  Even with that I can still give this cd 5 stars.  It's rare that You can buy a cd and listen to it the whole thing and not change the song because You dont like it, with this cd You dont have to do that. Every song is a gem waiting to be found.  The best of the best in my mind anyway are \\"No need to argue\\",\\"Ridiculous thoughts\\",\\"Empty\\",\\"Dreaming My dreams\\",\\"Daffodil lament\\",\\"Ode to My family\\" and \\"Zombie\\".  Pick up this Cranberries cd and also there first album \\"Everybody Else Is Doing It So Why Can't We.\\"
0140386335|5.0|Reading this book transports the reader into that space where we dream and forget the limits of our finite reality.  My whole family raved about this book, and every time I read it, I feel enriched and strangely enlightened.  Michael Ende must have opened himself up to some pretty divine inspiration when writing this, because it speaks profoundly on many spiritual and religious points of thought and belief.  The Neverending Story is a necessity for all who cherish imagination, wonder, and truth.  (Sounds cheesy I know, but it's true!!)
0440217563|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  I read it in 4 days.  Outlander was Diana Gabaldon's first book, and you can see her writing and style change and improve with each novel.  The non stop action kept me glued to each page.  As Jamie and Claire re-discover each other, the new characters make the adventure fun. A true romantic page turner.
B000021YQV|3.0|There are a few tracks on this album that are just amazing...Chop Suey, Toxicity, and one of my favorite songs ever - Aerials...but as a whole I cannot rate it so highly. Some of the other tracks are good, but many are only average or annoying.  They are at their best when they do songs that actually have melodies and when Serj actually sings, as in the three songs I named earlier.  Unfortunately, most of the songs don't have much of a melody, and Serj relies on yelling and screaming rather that using his excellent voice for what it does best...sing.  I still think the good outweighs the bad and that it is worth buying...but I don't think it deserves much of the praise it has gotton, such as Spin Magazine's album of the year.  THAT, I do not understand.
B000002ADT|5.0|amazing! this album stuns me. If you dont like this album then you probably are the type to drink wine out of a box.<BR>This music sends chills down my spine
B00004ZAV3|5.0|My daughter never understood the reality of the Beatles. She has listened to me sing along to the radio to them for years, but now things have changed. She got Beatles 1 for Christmas and suddenly I have a 13 year old Beatles maniac. She wants to hear all of the music and know all of the stories. She is buying books and CDs galore....It reminds me of myself at 13 years old. <br />What a gift to be able to share!
0767825411|3.0|Even though it came out in 1984, I only recently saw Ghostbusters for the first time just two weeks ago, and all I can say is that, although, it may have seemed pretty cool when it first came out, it isn't a classic, it doesn't stand the test of time and it really seems like an atypical, outdated '80s flic to me (like \\"The Breakfast Club,\\" \\"Police Academy,\\" \\"The A-Team\\" T.V. series, etc.).<br />The actors themselves aren't exactly Hollywood's greatest. Included is the overrated, non-versatile Bill Murray who seems to only play one type of role: A non-chalant \\"I don't care\\" type of actor which I thought didn't fit in well with Ghostbusters, it being a sci-fi drama-action flic.<br />The special effects were okay for its time but the movie doesn't provide an iota of suspense and it doesn't compensate for its lack of scariness except for the mediocre action scenes. I might have enjoyed it a LITTLE more had I seen it when it first came out when I was a teenager as I was more impressionable. But how other reviewers can rate this outdated flic more than 3 stars is beyond me. It's just not very good.<br />While I don't regret seeing this movie for the first time ever two weeks ago, it's certainly not a movie that I desire to see in the near or far future.
B0000508U6|5.0|I bought Coldplay's &quot;Parachutes&quot; last year after seeing the video for 'Yellow' about twenty times on MTVUK.  I was pleasently suprised to hear the great lyrics and beats.  It is definitley an album that you can listen to all the way through.
B000002KH3|2.0|Like most OTHER VH albums, their 1978 self-titled debut album is vastly overrated.  Most Van Halen songs in the Roth era are too simple -some to the extent that they lack the complexity that most \\"jingles\\" do.  There are a few 'average' songs from their debut, such as \\"Runnin' With The Devil,\\" \\"You Really Got Me,\\" Aint' Talkin' 'Bout Love,\\" and \\"Jamie's Cryin'.\\"  But of those, none really stand out though at least they're solid.<br />That's not to say that I completely diss Van Halen or am not a fan of them.  I have my own CD-R best hits compilation of VH, in fact.  It does, however, only consist of 11 songs from about 8 albums, which is an average of only 1 song per album.  At least I can say that most of them are some of my favorite rocks songs ever of any artist.<br />My Van Halen elite 11 are:<br />1.  Runnin' With The Devil<br />2.  Dance The Night Away<br />3.  And The Cradle Will Rock<br />4.  Unchained<br />5.  Jump<br />6.  Why Can't This Be Love<br />7.  Dreams<br />8.  Love Walks In<br />9.  When It's Love<br />10. Feels So Good<br />11. Right Now<br />Clearly, in my opinion, VH's best album is \\"5150\\" (my fav. Halen song is Dreams) and I I think that in the \\"Van Hagar\\" era, Van Halen had matured and made more complex and better music in general than the David Lee Roth era.  But with the exception of 5150 most VH albums have 1 or 2 songs at most that are really good -the rest pretty much suck and their debut is no exception.
B0000542DJ|3.0|Oliver Stone is a brilliant director and storyteller.  If you understand going in that his story is not fact, but a collection of unrelated conincidences, unsubstantiated anecdotes and pure rumor that is woven together as a fictional account of the Kennedy assassination you will do fine.  If you accept the film as gospel, you are doomed and there is nothing we can do to save you.<br />Based partially on the memoirs of Jim Garrison (the Oliver Stone of the legal world) and partially on the unsubstantiated claims of others, this film paints a dark and bizarre view of the most important event in our nation's last sixty years. It is as fascinating to watch as it is depressing to contemplate.<br />In this world, most everyone in the federal government at the time (including, apparently, the President's family) actively participates in a world-wide coverup for a group of cross-dressing anti-communists who murder John Kennedy for revenge.  Those that do not aid the coverup are actively involved in the plan itself.  Their allies may or may not include the Communists themselves, Organized Crime and Texas state and local governments.  They would also have to have the ongoing help of a good number of those that have held power in each of those groups from 1963 to the present as well.<br />Coming away from the film, you recognize Stone's genius as a storyteller and want more.  You should also recognize that what you saw was a story - the greatest urban legend of all time.<br />If Stone must have a conspiracy to investigate, here's one:  the CIA gives him the idea for &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; as payback.
B00005RDAF|4.0|While out Christmas shopping for his mother, my 5 year old asked if there were any Britney Spears DVDs available.  We checked and he asked if he could have this one for Christmas, so I got it.  I'm not much into her music but both of my sons love this DVD.  The short program is no problem since they tend to have relatively short attention spans and run from one toy to another.  One good thing is that this caused them to discover Joan Jett due to Britney's cover of &quot;I Love Rock and Roll&quot;.  The sound and video on this disc is excellent.  I don't remember girls looking quite like Britney when I was a teen...
B00005QDW1|5.0|I would say that most of the songs on this album are pretty good.  Exept for like on or two songs (Don't Let Me Down &amp; Waiting Room).  I like the variety of beats that were incorporated in this album.  Something different from Return of Saturn was that this cd is mostly upbeat compared to Return.. which was more mellow and slow. Good job No Doubt....
B00003CXB7|5.0|This 2-disc collection features 2 1/2 hours of extra documentaries, with recent interviews from cast members Donald Sutherland, Elliot Gould, Tom Skerritt, Sally Kellerman, Gary Burghoff, Rene Auberjenois, Fred Williamson, Bud Cort, Michael Murphy and John Schuck. Wish they woulda got ahold of JoAnn Pflug (Lt. Dish)....man, she looks great in the film; woulda loved to see what she looks like these days! But the film has been painstakingly restored and looks better than ever with all the surgery scenes intact. If you have friends or family who are only familiar with the TV series, you must show them this classic comedy and let 'em see where it all started. It still holds up today and looks like it always will! Great, great movie!
0140042520|5.0|I agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although I am a little biased (Kerouac is my favorite author), this book inspired me to write a poem after I finished reading it.  And although it may not inspire you to do anything at all, it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if you're an artist.  I read &quot;On The Road&quot;, &quot;The Town and The City&quot;, and just before this one, &quot;The Subterraneans&quot;, which I found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were 2 or 3 pages long !  This one was much more fun to read and I could not put it down.  If you really like Jack you should also check out James Baldwin and Norman Mailer.
B000001FKY|5.0|Hysteria is by a significant margin Def Leppard's best album (Pyromania is the 2nd best.  No other Def Leppard albums come close to either of them.).  Most bands are are lucky enough to come up with an album which has 2 or 3 great songs.  In my opinion, 8 of the 12 tracks from Hysteria are awesome and some of the best hard rock songs ever concocted by any artist.  (The only tracks that I don't care for are \\"Don't Shoot Shotgun,\\" \\"Run Riot,\\" \\"Exciteable,\\" and \\"Love And Affection.\\")<br />The music of Hysteria is rife with very memorable and melodic hooks that sometimes straddle the category of 'power ballad' but they all absolutely rock.  \\"Hysteria\\" and \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" are the best Def Leppard songs ever.  Two of my favorite songs that weren't included in Vault: 15 Greatest Hits are \\"Women\\" (great tune, great lyrics) and \\"Gods Of War\\" which is one of DL's most complex and emotionally powerful songs.  It's an anti-terrorist song and Ronald Reagan's audio excerpts and the jet sounds at the end are terrific.  Simply because Vault omitted these two tracks, I made my own Def Leppard hits compilation on CD-R.<br />Aside from Hysteria and Pyromania, Def Leppard's other albums are very subpar, mediocre at best.  Hysteria is awesome and may be the best hard rock album of all time.  It's certainly my favorite of all time.
0553381407|5.0|It takes courage to pick up this book -- to dare to consider the possibility that one's parents were, in fact, inadequate.  You might think that the book attempts to blame all one's difficulties on one's parents.  It doesn't.  It deftly adopts the stance simply that each person is responsible for his own actions.  You aren't responsible for what your parents did to you, and they aren't responsible for what you do now.  You are responsible for making your life better than it was for you as a child.  This book tells you how.<br />The book provides: 1. a marvelous catalog of virtually every possible kind of abusive parental behavior, from the most obvious to the most insidious and subtle 2. a list of the emotional effects of such behavior on children (and the adults they become) and 3. a strategy for overcoming these effects.<br />For once, a self-help author claims to know something, and proves it, without falling into defending some pet theory such as the one that every abuser was abused as a child (and is therefore somehow less guilty as an adult).  Susan forward completely avoids such pointless posturing.  She just identifies a problem, its effects, and its solution.  And she gives plenty of evidence for the correctness of her theory and practice.  Case histories abound.<br />About the only thing I don't like about the book is how she follows several case histories simultaneously.  I got a bit confused.  I recommend writing down the (fictional) names of the patients, so you can keep track of who is who.<br />All in all, the most helpful self-help book I've ever read.  Worth reading over and over.  Packed with clearly-stated wisdom.
6305807086|4.0|Even though we saw this in the theater, it was worth picking up the DVD.  I laughed so much the first time I saw it that I missed some key lines, so watching it again a couple of times has made me appreciate it more.  It's not often that a movie so clearly illuminates the dark side of the human condition and at the same time displays such youthful innocence.  Great flick!
0060392886|4.0|Hammer of the Gods, the rock bio that chronicles the good times and the bad times of Led Zeppelin (pun intended), is usually regarded as the ultimate guide for debauchery and bad behavior in the music world.  Although they've never reached quite the same legendary status critically, Motley Crue outdoes them in the excess department...by a landslide.  <br />Love them or hate them, the Crue always remained unapologetic for their ganglike lifestyles.  Drugs, deaths, domestic violence, prison, depression, groupies, and - sometimes - a heck of a lot of fun.  This surprisingly thick and detailed bio jumps back and forth between the main players (the band plus various managers and so forth) and reveals more than any fan could hope for.  As the various versions of the same story unfold it's clear that the guys still don't entirely understand the extent to which the other band members are capable of helping to ruin their very existences.  As if doing drugs and bedding the other band members' wives in public weren't bad enough, they were also usually doing worse drugs and bedding other wives and girlfriends that never got found out.  Until now.<br />Neil Strauss, who helped pen Marilyn Manson's subpar book a while back, has arranged these pages perfectly.  Aside from the &quot;dude&quot;-littered ramblings of Tommy Lee (which are unintentionally hilarious in spots) the band seems to have a pretty good grasp of the terror that they've inflicted on almost everyone they've met in the last two decades.  Mick Mars, who always struck me as being the quietly insane member of the band, keeps his words brief and to the point and comes across as the most down-to-earth (despite his ruminations on spirit worlds and dinosaur extinction theories).<br />All of the &quot;dirt&quot; is here.  Every drug shot up, every car wrecked, every drink drank, and every act of adultery intact.  It's an amazing journey into a world that only a few unlucky souls get to live in, a pure hell that revolves around the adulation of the fans and the medication required to keep that image from fading. While many bands have gone down this road I doubt that any have gone as far as Motley Crue.  They are truly lucky to be alive and able to brag about it and it makes a trashy good time to read.
B000059PR5|4.0|I first saw &quot;The Day After&quot; in 1983,at the height of the nuclear war movies,when President Reagan had his famous &quot;Evil Empire&quot; speech.  I also remember seeing &quot;Threads&quot;,&quot;Special Bulletin&quot;,and &quot;Testament&quot; at the time.  I did not sleep peacefully for the following week,remembering the horrifying mushroom clouds bursting over Kansas City(I knew that these were special effects,but it all seemed too real,knowing that it could really take place),the graphic images of people,animals and objects being instantaneously vaporized(the x-ray effect I remember),and the impossibly realistic image of a fireball engulfing the city and everything in its path. I am glad that we live in a somewhat more peaceful time,yet in the back of my mind knowing that some rogue nation may take out its anger against us,and the nuclear missles still in existence can do just as much harm today as they could have done almost twenty years ago.  I am happy that I have found a copy of The Day After,and can view it again with a more open insight and mind. Jason Robards,JoBeth Williams and Steve Guttenberg stand out in this film;certainly one of the best performances by Robards in any of the nuclear disaster epics.
B000002H1T|4.0|Simply put, this is my favorite Cars album.  The sound is more pop-rock than their prior productions as synthesizers are heavily employed.<br />Heartbeat City is nearly perfect and would qualify as my Cars: Greatest Hits compilation if only a few amendments were made: Substitute \\"Shake It Up\\" and \\"Just What I Needed\\" for \\"Why Can't I Have You\\" (very slow and forgettable) and \\"Stranger Eyes\\" (solid, but not great).<br />Heartbeat City is probably The Cars best album and definitely my favorite.  Every song is a perfect synthesizer/guitar combo that rocks like only The Cars can.
0380778556|5.0|&quot;Rebecca&quot; by Daphne Du Maurier is arguably one of the best books ever written.<br /> The presence of Rebecca is haunting and unforgettable. The shy, timid and unamed second Mrs. DeWinter is another wonderful character, although she is overshadowed by the commanding presence of Rebecca. Another worthy character is that of Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper who seems to keep Rebecca's presence 'ever alive'.<br /> Ms. Du Maurier's prose is simple and flowing, providing a spellbinding and haunting read.<br />A permenant book by my bedside, &quot;Rebecca&quot; will be read over and over again.<br /> A wonderful read for all age groups, I truly reccomend it to everyone.
B00000064G|5.0|Nick Drake released only three albums in his too-short life.  &quot;Pink Moon&quot; was his last, and in my mind best, album.  But, if you've never heard any of his music before, I think you might want to start with his first album, &quot;Five Leaves Left.&quot;  It will give you a good first indication of where he's coming from musically and will prepare you for the stark, emotional sound of &quot;Pink Moon.&quot;  <BR>   From the very begining of his career, Nick was showered with critical praise, but his first album was a commercial failure.  He attempted to remedy this by coating his second album (&quot;Bryter Layter&quot;) with a lush arrangement and slick production (which is probably why it's my least favorite of his albums, but it's still VERY good).  Again, despite his best efforts and the praise of fellow musicians, the album went completely unnoticed.  In some ways, he was very naive and he couldn't understand why an album that recieved such glowing reviews in the intellectual quarter of the press failed to sell.  Trends in popular music were against him at the time.  The period from '69-72 saw the emergence of the &quot;power trio&quot; in rock, and the general population wasn't receptive to Nick's quiet, melancholy, and very english type of music.<BR>   All his frustration and depression over his lack of success came through on &quot;Pink Moon.&quot;  He abandoned the busy production of his second album and recorded &quot;Pink Moon&quot; in two nights with only his guitar, a piano on a few tracks, and his breathy, almost whispered vocals.<BR>   This is an amazingly beautiful and emotional album.  It weaves pictures of abandonment, frustration, and regret.  It perfectly illustrates Nick's inablity to understand and coexist with the world he found himself in.  Many reviewers have said that this is a depressing album.  I suppose it is in a way, but I don't think it reads like a suicide letter.  Despite it's mournfull tone, it is also infused throughout with a sense of hope; hope that beauty and dreams can somehow clear a path through the muddle of all our lives and lead us to something true.<BR>   Buy this album.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This is definitely my favorite album. I buy new CDs often, but still play this one. The songs are well written and performed, Dido's voice is amazing and full of emotions, though her singing is smooth and pleasant to the ear.<br />The songs in this album would mostly fall into the &quot;chillout&quot; current, but they are way more than that, as they have very good music, a great text and are performed by a real artist.<br />I cannot say which one is my favorite, I like them all! But probably Hunter is pretty close to being my favorite.
B00005TT77|5.0|Not much to say, just listen to a sample or mp3 and you will love it.  These songs are so alive, 50yrs from now musicians will still be wanting to sing these great songs.  These artists  do nice justice to the Beatles songs.  The tracks are just different enough but yet still similar.  I felt alot of emotion listening to this soundtrack. I am not a soundtrack fan and have not seen the movie, just love Beatles music.  This is a very, very good album.
B000002L99|4.0|5150 is easily Van Halen's best album.  \\"Dreams,\\" \\"Love Walks In,\\" and \\"Why Can't This Be Love\\" are three of the best songs that VH has ever come up with.  Like most of other VH's best songs, they are synth-rock combos with very poignant, memorable hooks.  \\"Summer Nights\\" and \\"5150\\" are decent but not great; the remaining songs are very forgettable and talentless.<br />5150, the debut of Sammy Hagar, is Van Halen at its apex of its creativity.  In the David Lee Roth era Van Halen's rock was harder but most the material is very simple.  In the Hagar era, VH became more pop-rock oriented, creative, and complex but the vast majority of their songs -as with the Roth era- really don't cut it.  Most Van Halen albums are vastly overrated and  have only 1 or 2 songs at the most that are good.<br />If you want a compilation of Van Halen's best, \\"The Best of Van Halen, Vol. 1\\" is a very good compilation.
B00005LB9O|2.0|Bland, bland, bland, bland, bland. Hmmm, wonder if I could set that to an acoustic guitar and a shuffling drum beat. Probably would sound the same as any of the other tracks on this carbon copy of their last album. Take that back; I'd have to rhyme bland with hand, remand, or gland before getting it right. <br />I used to like Travis when their debut was released, but since then every song they've written sounds like a wet sponge. Maybe they don't have to work at it any more, or maybe they like making music your grandparents would listen to. Nothing edgy or inspiring to comment on. At least by using a banjo you could argue that the musical envelope has been pushed, but I don't think it would be a valid claim. &quot;Side&quot; sounds like &quot;Drive&quot; by the Cars...<br />This is a band that wrote a song called &quot;All I Wanna Do Is Rock&quot; for crying out loud! Hey, Travis! Why not try to &quot;rock&quot; on your next album?  Better idea, dump Fran so he can do his little miserable shtick on his own, because the rest of the band must be bored. Rich, but bored.
B000002LLC|2.0|Most of this album is just not that great! Vogue is the sole bright spot, but i'll admit that Hanky Panky, More, Something To Remember and What can you Lose are O.K. If you have not been exposed to any of Madonna's albums before, don't let this be your first!  Go buy Music, Like A Prayer, or Erotica (my personal favorite) instead!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Ah, the ecstasy, the thrill of a big production!  I loved everything about this film, from the trademark Luhrmann editing, to the bigger-than-big dance sequences, to the absolutely trite and predictable storyline, to the little &quot;see who recognizes the pop reference first&quot; game that you inevitably play against whomever your watching this film with.  This is what happens when you combine a smart, young, creative filmmaker with Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein.  The acting?  Nothing to write home about.  The singing?  I've heard better.  But it isn't any one element that sells this movie, it's the grandeur of it that makes it a wonderful EXPERIENCE.  And isn't that what we want from a movie in the first place?
B000001EHS|5.0|Vault: 15 Greatest Hits is an excellent, near perfect compilation of Def Leppard's best songs.  It should come as no surprise, and I at least am certainly satisfied, that most of the material used in Vault comes from their hands-down two best albums: Hysteria and Pyromania.  Still, at least in my opinion, it's almost perfect but not quite.<br />Although I'm definitely not anything resembling a Def Leppard \\"completist\\" (I only like Hysteria and Pyromania), due to the fact that I love Def Leppard's 'best' songs so much I ended up making my OWN Def Leppard Greatest Hits compilation on CD-R (which is what I also normally end up doing with most other artists' best hits.<br />My Greatest Hits ended up also having 15 tracks.  It's nearly the exact same as Vault except that the following songs were omitted: 1. When Love And Hate Collide (sounds way too much like \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad,\\" which is significantly better).  2. Two Steps Behind (very mediocre).  3. Bringin' On The Heartbreak (one of the worst and most annoying Def Leppard songs I've ever heard; very \\"filler\\" material).<br />In their places I substituted the three following songs:  1. Women (awesome lyrics and awesome music.  If not one of the best from Hysteria, most certainly one of the better ones).  2. Gods Of War (one of Def Leppard's most complex and awesome songs ever made.  Very melodic but rocks.  Great pro U.S.A./anti-terrorist song and the ending is great).  3. Too Late For Love (I don't know how this was omitted from Vault considering all the radio play this has received.  Not one of my fav. Leppard songs but very solid, nonetheless).<br />Even though I found a few minor faults with Vault and, like I do with most other bands best hits -make my OWN compilation- Vault should nonetheless satisfy most Def Leppard or hard rock fans.
0553106635|3.0|I am surprised that people loved this book so much. Not because the author and the story are fantastic and wonderfully wrought with enough twists to keep your head spinning, but the third book is nothing but a repackaged version of the second book. I was extremely dissappointed to find that out. <br />Read the excerpt pages and you will find out that you have read those words before.
B000000OPU|5.0|1986's So was Peter Gabriel's commercial breakthrough.  After almost twenty years of releasing albums, Mr. Gabriel had never cracked the US top ten on either the singles or album charts as a solo artist or with Genesis.  That all changed with So, as the album peaked at number two and spawned two top ten singles.  The first single, &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; went all the way to number one thanks to a catchy, danceable beat and a classic and inventive video.  The song is a departure from his usual world beat sounds and even if it is a definite attempt to be more commercial, the song is among his best.  &quot;Big Time&quot; was the other top single, peaking at number eight, and it follows the same formula as &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, with a big hook and a danceable melody.  Even though those two songs are the big hits, the most memorable song from the album may well be &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; which has a classic world beat sound from Mr. Gabriel.  The song gained new life three years after the album was released, thanks to prominent use in Cameron Crowe's superb film, Say Anything.  &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; is a gorgeous song with a haunting vocal performance by Kate Bush.  So was a major critical and commercial success and elevated a much deserving Mr. Gabriel to a big time rock star level.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|You all know the story about this being Cameron Crowe's not so semi-autobiographical coming of age story about being a young rock n' roll journalist.  The acting is all superb, the editing, the soundtrack, the pace, the tone--in short, everything is absolutely perfect in this film.  Cameron Crowe somehow managed to make a quintissentially funny, romantic, nostalgic, melancholy, celebratory, tragic masterpiece, and anyone who has ever loved something and seen its deterioration will respond, primally, to this film.  Remarkable in every way.<br />The only way for Crowe to make it better was to release a &quot;director's cut&quot; and a treasure trove of extra features so that the viewer wouldn't be forced to leave that world before he/she was ready.  I couldn't recommend this more emphatically.
B000002H70|4.0|The Cure is one of the very few bands of the Alternative Rock genre that I like.<br />As other reviewers have stated, this is The Cure's best album, hands down. Disintegraion has some of the most gothic, romantic and enchanting songs The Cure has ever written.  \\"Pictures Of You\\" is deeply emotional and melancholic.  Two other favorite tracks of mine are \\"Fascination Street,\\" which is has a dark and witchy-ominous quality, and \\"Lullaby\\" which is seductive and haunting.<br />Disintegration can be considered a greatest hits album as it truly has about all of The Cure's best songs.
B000002JEV|5.0|If for no other reason buy it for John Bonham's powerhouse drumming. Simply awesome. The final track 'Thank you' is spine chillingly brilliant. I weeped when I first heard it.
B000000OSW|4.0|After the success of So, Peter Gabriel got experimental and released the soundtrack album Passion.  It took him six years to release a follow up to So with 1992's Us.  The album follows the format of So, but the songs aren't quite up to So's level, but they are still very strong.  &quot;Digging In the Dirt&quot; is a fabulous song that has a slow as molasses rhythm that thumps along like a heartbeat until the refrain rings with a clanging guitar.  &quot;Steam&quot; is like &quot;Big Time&quot; redux, but is a decent track while &quot;Kiss That Frog&quot; shows off a fun side to the normally ultra seriousness that Mr. Gabriel exudes.  Us is a quality album that amazingly is last studio release Mr. Gabriel has released.
0525457585|4.0|This is dark children's fantasy at its, um, most absorbing. I only wish I could read the original German; some of the book's poetry is obviously lost in translation. But the story and characters are intact and wonderful. The second half of the book is less satisfying than the first; it is not a story I'd want to find myself in, but Bastian's adventure is definitely exciting enough for adults and children both.
0312965788|5.0|All Creatures Great and Small is a book about James Herriot's spirit after becoming a veterinarian in 1937.  His life-long journey begins when he moves to the beautiful countryside of Yorkshire England to work for Dr. Farnon.  Dr Farnon is a respected veterinarian in the area and becomes James' mentor.  James learns very quickly that there are many ups and downs in his vocation.  Angry farmers, stubborn animals, and 3:30 house calls are just the start of his fun.  His compassion is very evident in this book.  He is a great role model for anyone.  I was interested in reading this book because I am pursuing a goal to be a veterinarian myself.  This book gives me very useful insight on how I could live my own life.  I would recommend All Creatures Great and Small to anyone interested in reading a heartwarming story about animals.
B000001U3K|5.0|this album is probably the best of lou reed's solo career. the velvet underground are one of my favorite bands, and i think he never really captured that magic again. but, 'transformer,' is pretty  close.<br />david bowie and mick ronson were very involved with this album, and bowie's influence can be heard all over it. not to say this album sounds like david bowie, but he did seem to tap into uncharted territory in reed's talent. great songs are aplenty here. 'vicious,' is a nasty little rocker opening the album, and leads into the more subdued, 'andy's chest,' which is one of my favorite lou reed songs, with or without the velvet underground.<br />'perfect day,' is one of the most magical songs i have ever heard, although i almost always associate it with the o.d.-ing scene in, 'trainspotting.' it's a lovely, lovely track. the next song, 'hangin' 'round,' is another great rocker, with absolutely hilarious lyrics. and then, the big hit, 'walk on the wild side,' comes on. a great song but not the best on the album.<br />that's 5 songs of pure, unadultured bliss, and there's more. the cheesy but sweet, 'sattelite of love,' (another of his best songs), and, 'goodnight ladies,' with it's haunting brass section follows. i have yet to really digest the other songs, but not many of them are as good as the aforementioned. <br />the great thing about this album is that it can be bought on the cheap. so buy it, for [goodness] sake. it's so good.
B000002C1V|5.0|I must agree with many previous reviews that this album is more of a Waters' solo record than a Pink Floyd record.  Although this album continues with some of the themes that were touched on 'The Wall' this is a tighter and more cohesive album. The themes of this record deal with Rogers' views on war, the death of his father, the Government, his childhood and how it all eventually shaped him.  The record is a bleak look into his personal pain.  The beautiful orchestration of co-producer Michael Kamen gives this album an epic feel.  To attempt to highlight a couple of stand-out tracks would not do this album justice.  This album befits the ideal of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.  However, I would have enjoyed this album even more if they left off the track 'Not Now John' and replaced it with 'When the Tigers Broke Free' a track that appeared in the film version of 'The Wall' but left off the album but which can now be heard on the cd 'Echoes The Best of Pink Floyd'.  <BR>In all, I find this record to be a masterpiece and one of the finest records ever made, but not quite a Pink floyd album as much as a Roger Waters solo album.

006092988X|4.0|\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is an America classic, so you probably already know the plot outline.  The book is the story of Francie, a poor young girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early years of the 20th century.  Francie is an intelligent girl who aspires to be a writer, but she has to overcome the predictable obstacles associated with poverty and absence of connections.<br /> But the author doesn't over-romanticize the story by inventing a too-good-to-be-true character who is single-mindedly ambitious.  Francie has the same concerns as any young girl in the poor section of Brooklyn would have had during those years.  She is no more honest, no more selfless, no more generally virtuous, than any other girl.  That typical-ness, I believe, is the key to the book's popularity.<br /> The book has been more popular with women than men, I believe, because the book evokes powerful memories of what a girl's childhood is like.  And the female readers whom I have talked to all say, \\"Yes.  That's just what it was like.\\"  And it's probably not a bad idea for men - especially men with daughters - to have that vicarious experience by reading the book, either.<br /> Heartwarming, genuine, and well worth your time.

B000007MVD|5.0|I had delayed buying this cd because of some of the more negative reviews.  BOY - did I waste time!  Guess you just can make some people happy.  These recording were made for BBC radio shows in the early to mid 60's.  There were no studio magic tricks to be performed.  Of course some of the quality isn't like a regular studio recording - what do you expect?  The Beatles intentionally performed songs that they were not releasing to give the listeners something to look forward to - why tune in to a radio show to hear a song you can play on your turntable any time you want?  This is as close as most of us will ever get to knowing what it was like to see a live performance by the Beatles.  If you are a Beatles fan (and real Beatles fans do not only like the phsycodelic stuff - they may prefer it - but they appreciate all aspects of the band) then you have to own this.  The interview clips are hysterical (especially when John yells in the background &quot;Tell 'em about my book!&quot;).  The songs are wonderful - very energetic and raw.  Really makes you wish you could have caught them at the Cavern!  As for &quot;I'll Be On My Way&quot; - the only Lennon/McCartney song on the album that they never released, I don't see why a June/moon rhyme is a bad thing - I love that song! Paul's versions of &quot;That's All Right&quot; and &quot;Lucille&quot; are really great.<br />If you don't own yet and you are reading this - click &quot;ADD TO SHOPPING CART&quot; RIGHT NOW!

B00000DRA9|5.0|This is the perfect soundtrack to one of the best fantasy films ever made. The music is very original and feels like it has the ability to transport you into the movie. I love every track ecpecially 'Swamps of saddness', 'Ivory tower' and the opening theme. If you like the film or enjoy film music you will love this CD, I never get sick of listening to it.

0446525537|5.0|I can't say enough good stuff about this book. This is by far Nicholas's best novel, in my opinion. I read it in about two hours and sobbed nonstop for about the last 50 pages. I don't think I've cried so much in my life! This is an incredibly poignant, beautiful story about true love and how two seventeen-year-olds' lives, as well as their whole town, were changed forever. This is definietly one to read over and over again, but I wouldn't go near it without a full box of Kleenex! As a fifty-seven-year-old Landon Carter says in the prologue, &quot;First you'll smile, and then you'll cry. Don't say you haven't been warned.&quot;

0375507507|4.0|Born to parents who are much loved by their children but self-centered and almost criminally irresponsible in their child-rearing, Alexandra Fuller reconstructs her remarkable childhood in Rhodesia, Malawi, and Zambia.  British expatriates, her parents seem to have gravitated to Africa because it is a place which enables them to live, work, and drink on their own terms, freed from the limitations imposed by conventional society.<br /><br />Opposing majority rule in the countries where he lives, the father serves as part of an active, armed, white militia in Rhodesia.  He teaches his two daughters how to handle guns and to shoot to kill, and tells them what to do if their parents are killed.  As Mum and Dad eke out lives as farmers and ranchers during Rhodesia's civil war, they treat as mere inconveniences the landmines planted in their dirt roads, the razor wire fencing around their property, the armed escorts when they go to town, the necessary bribery of officials, and even the abuse of their daughters.  Not even vicious assaults on their help and their animals can shake them from their self-involved world or make them fully connect with their children.<br /><br />Despite all this and her mother's several frightening breakdowns, Alexandra (Bobo) clearly loves  her parents, the independence of her childhood, and her African life, which fills her senses with unique and beautifully described sights, sounds, and smells.  She accepts as normal the scorpions in the algae- and mosquito-laden swimming pool, the cobra she shoots inside the house, the cat-sized rats, and the leopards, which farm managers illegally kill and skin.  Without self-consciousness, she reveals her own naïve acceptance of her \\"superior\\" role, developing, as she matures, a growing sensitivity to the Africans whose world she shares.  As she relates her tale, complete with the teasing, the local slang, and a point of view which feels absolutely right for her age, the reader marvels at the normalcy she reflects and the resilience of her spirit.  This is a remarkable celebration of a remarkable childhood and of an irrepressible spirit, triumphant.  Mary Whipplethe resilience of her spirit.

B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt's latest offering ROCK STEADY is a bit of a departure from their other albums. As a fan, you either love it, or you don't. This fan here loves it. The album has a more electronica feel, with a few more beats and texturized sounds. No Doubt worked with a variety of producers on this album, namely William Orbit, Nellee Hooper, Prince, etc. The result is a fun party album which has a variety of music styles, including reggae, ska, pop, and more. To me the biggest standout of the album is the Prince produced track &quot;Waiting Room&quot;, which is an irresistible song to listen to, very catchy, hopefully it will be released as a single. Other great songs include &quot;Running&quot;, which features compelling vocals by Gwen, some of her best, &quot;Making Out&quot;, &quot;Underneath it All&quot;, &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. Not for everyone, but its a nice move and overall a great album. Give it a try.
B000002IWQ|4.0|Since Rush is my favorite group, I'm pretty much buying everything they've put out.  I thought it was time to see what their latter-day stuff sounds like, although I had heard PRESTO before.  1993's COUNTERPARTS shows Rush going back to their hard rock roots with some pretty intense results.  Although the record starts off with a bang, it kind of drags in the middle which is rare for a Rush album (since most of their records are consistent, with no bad tracks).  This may not be my favorite Rush album, but I still like it.<br />&quot;Animate&quot; is yet another dynamic opening song in their canon, with groove-oriented arrangements and tribal rhythms.  &quot;Stick It Out&quot; is definitely one of my top 10 favorite Rush songs ever.  It's heavy, aggressive, and the music perfectly complements Neil's almost-paranoid lyrics (&quot;Stick it out/Don't swallow the poison/Stick it out/Don't swallow your pride&quot;).  &quot;Cut to the Chase&quot; continues the hard-rockin' goodness with its explosive main riff and lyrics that discuss taking chances and preparing for consequences.  After those three great tracks, the rest is pretty much a mixed bag.  &quot;Leave That Thing Alone&quot; is a great, moody instrumental, unlike &quot;YYZ&quot; or &quot;La Villa Strangiato,&quot; but it has an awesome groove.  &quot;Alien Shore&quot; and &quot;Double Agent&quot; (the latter shows Geddy Lee deepening his voice to sound like the angel and devil in the song) are also note-worthy.  I don't really care much for &quot;Cold Fire&quot; and the ballad &quot;Nobody's Hero,&quot; unfortunately.  &quot;Everyday Glory&quot; has a nice melody and solo by Alex, but the lyrics are directly lifted from &quot;Nobody's Hero.&quot;  That's strange.<br />Overall, COUNTERPARTS shows that Rush still have it.  The musicianship is still there, Neil can still write great lyrics, and it proves they can still rock.  Too bad about the filler songs, though.
B000002U9Y|4.0|Saucerful of secrets is the more compelling, weirder cousin of Piper at the gates of dawn. Wheras Piper often gets by on it's charm alone, this lp is far more diverse, and as a result, mistake ridden.<br />Let there be more light - Beats anything they had previously done. Very Crimson-esque. 9/10<br />Remember a day - Dreamy gothic pop. Wrights key riff in the subdued chorus is melancholic in the extreme. 8/10<br />Set the controls - brilliant psychedelia. Put on a well placed speaker system and drift away. Better than the cloudy, sludgy version on ummagumma.  10/10<br />Corporal Clegg - This would have continued the album well, were it not for 2 KAZOO SOLO's. Wheras the kazoo on Hendrix's Crosstown Traffic sounded ace, Hendrix could make a triangle sound good. If you can find a way to edit out the kazoo, you have a fun pop song. 2/10 (7.5/10 if you edit the kazoo)<br />Saucerful of Secrets - The presence of Corp Clegg's wet kazoo fart &quot;joke&quot;, sandwiched between Set the controls and this track, is a joke in itself. This track sounds like it is trying to create a nightmarish ambiance - and it works. Wrights coda at the end makes it all &quot;make sense&quot;. The creepy sound effects are dated but entriging nonetheless. The acid quotient on this song has a ph of 1. 8/10<br />See Saw - I saw this got a beating in some of the reviews. It's not an engaging song, but it's spacy arrangement is cool. On the bad side, it sounds like Wright making a half arsed attempt to copy sid's unique songwriting. 6/10<br />Jugband Blues - Pretty overated. It's the worst track if you take away the kazoo on corp clegg. 3/10

The music and the lyrics are beautiful and romantic - you add Luis Miguel and you got a hit. If you don't understand Spanish, you don't need to.  The music speaks for itself.  Buy it you will not be dissapointed and you will play it forever. It's captivating. You need to see him in concert.

0596000480|5.0|I had a VERY basic knowledge of JavaScript coming to this book, (i.e. I could make an alert popup) and no knowledge of other programing languages (well HTML, but that doesn't counts). I found it to be an excelent resource and teaching tool. True, some parts are complicated, but you can skip around chapters with relative ease, and I could always figure things out with some puzzling. It's nice how authoritative it is, and how completely it documents the syntax. It takes a while to get into the programing mood and understand its power though, so it requires some thought to get into the more advanced techniques. I would recommend this book to anyone, with the possible exception of someone without a strong basis in HTML. Also, quite frankly, what you get out of this book depends on your intelligence. If you like to read manuals (like I do), and have a strong basic computer knowledge to back this up, it'll be all you could hope for.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes became one of my favorite bands within 48 hours of my first exposure to them.  I haven't felt this kind of excitement about a band since first hearing Stereolab or Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;.  Not much good music is played to the masses, but every once in a while something great comes along, and The Strokes are even better.<br />The songs are simple yet well thought out in their composition.  Nothing is overplayed and there's always something fresh beaten into your ear drum.  They're great song writers, incredibly catchy, and definitely put a unique spin on their influences which sound like the Velvet Underground, Ramones, The Doors, maybe Stereolab, The Clash, and early Talking Heads.<br />Buy this album for it's mastery of the music...not for the hype.
0451167716|5.0|How often does one read a novel that takes you on a trip as though you were there, side by side, with the characters of the book? Unfortunately, not very often. Surely they're mostly fictious creations from human minds, often forgotten about after the last page is turned. However, The Godfather is a different issue. This book is as engaging as the movie is, and the characters come out with as much punch and realism as depicted by Brando, Pacino, De Niro, Caan, Duvall and Cazale. That's the first thing that makes this book so wonderful...the characters are so real and entirely believable, almost as though Vito or Michael or anyone of the Corleones took you by the hand and pulled you into their lives. Secondly, the book is incredibely eloquent and beautifully written, in a style that is often subject to emulation and envy, probably by Mario Puzo himself. None of his books come out as electrifying as this. The Last Don, Omerta, The Fortunate Pilgrim, The Sicilian...all these make good reads, but none are as memorable or as moving. Finally, on a much more personal note, everyone I know who has read this book (including myself) were left begging for more. It ended too soon, and I believe it would have ended too soon had Puzo wrote another four hundred pages. It is impossible to have enough of this book. Unarguably, the best novel about the Mafia, and definitely my favourite book.

Well, I have been depriving myself all these years from enjoying a cinematic masterpiece.  A movie made in another time period, about something that is hardly out of date -- the worth-fullness of our own lives, and the optimism and hope that comes from knowing that we do make a difference.  <br />But as sappy as this topic could be in the hands of a lesser writer/director, Frank Capra puts it into an engaging story that we can all relate to.  Now I know why this is a yearly tradition in American households.  We need this movie.  Only if to remind us of how valuable we each are.  Buy it, watch it and rewatch it.

The sound quality is the worst I have ever heard for a concert that was filmed in the last 10 years.  Definitely NOT worth getting on DVD.  Not worth owning at all, really.<br />The camera work is good, but the actual performance is only average.  Definitely a group of talented guys, but this particular show is fairly boring.  It was shot a couple of years ago, so maybe they have improved their stage presence since then.  <br />Unless you are in the BSB target market (i.e., a teen-age girl) you will likely be disappointed with this DVD.  I recommend buying their Greatest Hits DVD instead and wait for a better quality live performance DVD from them.
6305609721|5.0|Star Trek IV was the well anticipated sequel to The Search for Spock. Trek III left a cliffhanger so large that the filmmakers had a veritable world of possibilities available. The mid-eighties Eco-trend was pulled off perfectly in its time, and the present. Species are still on the brink of extinction, global warming, and rainforests are still a problem. STIV takes the trek fans and non-trek fans on a wild ride back in time to 1986 to combat the extinct species problem. The 23rd century is devoid of: Whales. An alien probe is unleashing punishment on man for his abuse, and ultimate extinction, of the \\"humpback\\" whale. Kirk and crew (minus the Enterprise) have to go back in time to bring a couple of whales to the 23rd century to thwart the probes destruction. Spock is not himself, but he's far more hilarious, and the crew must travel in a rust bucket Klingon ship that is battle damaged from the late starship Enterprise. The movie is filled with twists and turns that are sure to still please fans and closet fans alike. Remember, Kirk and Co. are still outlaws in the 23rd century, and strangers in the 20th...
B00005RFQ5|5.0|A prince fan for 20 years, this album is a pleasant return for the artist back towards really exciting music. Prince's guitar is back, as is the voice of God (or the Wise One) from Temptation from Around the World. It harks of Quincy Jones. Prince is reveling in God again which he has a long history of, maybe his new found faith (he's a Witness now), is young, but building a song like &quot;Willing to Do the Work&quot; pay homage to God, James Brown and makes me want to go door to door, frankly. He seems to be regesturing at his roots of Jones, Brown, Gospel, Jazz and identifying strongly as Africa American. I always though Prince's music was best was he was riding a stint without a female figure. The performance, composition and production shine.

0451205146|5.0|This book is simply a great story.  The author does an incredible job of conveying the chaos and fear that these soldiers went through.  The first 250 pages of the book have the pace, feel and horror of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan.<br />Several reviewers have commented that the author seems to be trying to convey a political message.  In reality, he does anything but.  The book is not about the political situation that resulted in this battle.  Instead, the book, just as the soldiers on whom it focuses, takes the political situation as a given and instead focuses primarily, and deals almost exclusively on an minute-by-minute description of the battle itself.  What I took away most from the book is the sense of duty and loyalty to their fellow soldiers that drives these young men to keep going, even beyond the point where they are scared to death.   Our country is lucky to have young men (and women) like that.<br />My only real quibble with the book is that additional maps and diagrams would have been helpful.  The action was so fast-paced and detailed that it was hard to keep track of who was where and what was going on.  Of course, as other reviewers have mentioned, that pace and confusion does result in the reader experiencing some small shadow of what the soldiers themselves felt.
0517122707|5.0|Don't be dissuaded from owning this book and consequently not being able to share it with kindred spirits. Reviewers &quot;egreg1&quot; and &quot;A Reader&quot; don't get it. This Pulitzer Prize winning kind of humor must be too sophisticated for their limited world view. From reading their &quot;thoughts&quot;, I would conjecture they have a problem with the &quot;politically incorrect&quot; nature of many of the sentiments of our protagonist.  This book was written in the sixties and is a fiction. <br />And what a gem it is. I have read it twice now, and will I'm sure, read it again and again.  There is not a boring page or line in the book.  You can open to just about anywhere and crack a smile.  The first time I read this classic I was on a plane laughing out loud.  People around me demanded to know what I was reading. <br />People who do not genuinely enjoy this master work say more about themselves than about the author.
0425074811|5.0|Wow, I have to admit, when I read this, I was a skeptic, and was like, &quot;I'll never buy this stuff&quot; but by the end of the first chapter, I was a believer!!!  But, the underlying fact that authors is NOT that aliens visited earth, but MORE that why can't people accept OTHER beliefs beside their own?  He just wants to say, &quot;there ARE other possibilities, maybe not these, but SOMETHING.&quot;  A VERY quick and entertaining read.  Good book to take on Vacation ;)
B00005KFUM|5.0|Ok, I'm not sure exactly which one to review, being 4 versions of this, but, whatever. I pretty got both of Muse's albums at the same time and i like this one better. The guitars, pianos, and singing are truly excellent and brilliant. The beginning piano intros the New Born and Bliss are haunting and I wish all of the songs had the pianos in them. All the songs are so different from each other and each time you listen you will find something new. The best songs are New Born, Bliss, and Plug In Baby. you HAVENT LIVED YET If you haven't heard those songs. The riff in plug in baby is awesome. Space Dimentia is also a sort of Haunting sound with pianos. This is a must have in any collection, all the songs are brilliant and they never get boring. What else can I Say?
B00005N9CV|2.0|Because I loved previous releases of DK, I pre-ordered two of these CD to use one as a gift for somebody very special to me. However, this disk is a sad disappointment. Shortly speaking, it is over-produced, arrangements are annoying, sound quality is poor. 'Besame Mucho' is a disaster...<br />She sings slow ballads, which I like best in her interpretation, but the feeling of intimacy is missing. After two years of silence this CD sounds like a joke from such a talented artist.<br />It is no use to make further critical comments concerning this record - read others from those who describe themselves as her big fans and yet give it one or two stars only. Unfortunately, they are perfectly right.<br />Sorry K., I didn't know...
B00001SIES|4.0|If you like Radiohead, I really suggest you buy both these band's CDs. Imagine Radiohead slightly heavier and with the addition of pianos in a couple songs like &quot;Sunburn&quot; and &quot;Cave&quot;. I actually bought this after downloading only Muscle Museum, which is the best song, very catchy and original. I'm very glad I bought this. Also check out the band Ours if you haven't already.
B00004RJ71|5.0|If you like this movie, be sure and pick up Jimmy Santiago Baca's books! It will give you insight on this movie!
0380778556|5.0|The story begins with one of my favorite opening paragraphs (second only to A Tale of Two Cities): &quot;Last night, I dreamed I went to Manderly again.....&quot; From there we are swept into a seaside story of paranoia and excrutiating love. Rebecca is a classic mystery story set in a lone English Manor by the sea and filled with dark secrets. It is a tale of rivalry. A new, young, painfully shy wife, is brought into a legendary estate, and forced to share her marriage with the presence of her husband's beautiful and tragically departed wife - Rebecca. I read this book for the first time when I was twelve years old. I thought Mrs. Danvers, the obsessed (maybe possessed is a better word) housekeeper was the devil (still do). I remember lying in bed in the dark of night, hearing only the ticking of a clock in the hallway and feeling that Rebecca was watching me too. I was insanely in love with Maxim, and desperate for his approval of our heroine.  I used to try and guess what her &quot;beautiful and unusual name&quot; could possibly be, since Du Maurier never tells us but consistently refers to it, admitting later that she could simply never think of one.<br />Du Maurier, one of the great masters of suspense, uses the art of manipulation in its' finest form here - leading your mind and thoughts where she wants them to go. You feel what she wants you to feel and are shocked when she wants you to be shocked. You smell the salty sea. You hear the dark ocean waves lapping on the shore like long, cold fingers. And most of all, you share the terror of the unyielding presence of Rebecca.<br />A jolly good read.
B000000WA4|3.0|First, let me say that Billy Corgan could have cut a few songs from &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; and I would give him five stars. Why? Because when he gets to screaming, he overdoes his chops, often dipping into irrelevance that frightens the children.<br />As we all know, there is some classic stuff on here. You can't beat &quot;1979&quot; or &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; or &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings,&quot; the best song ever in Corgan's preferred &quot;let's all scream, shall we?&quot; style.<br />Then there are the songs that aren't singles but are still great: the piano opening to &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; is one of Corgan's finer compositions. &quot;Lily&quot; is a great love song, Corgan's strong suit although he doesn't seem to favor these songs as much as his screaming. &quot;We Only Come Out At Night&quot; is what those darn Everquest kiddies need as an anthem-it describes them perfectly. <br />Then the rest pretty much stinks, since Corgan cannot fill 9 minutes with noise too well, as he tried on one song. In fact, for the most part, any song where Corgan screams is to be avoided like the plague. Usually his howled denunciations don't make much sense and it's kind of frightening.<br />But it was only a precursor to the best stuff of Corgan's career: the Internet-only &quot;Machina II,&quot; which is the finest music the Pumpkins ever made. Go figure.
0440180295|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; is one of the finest books I've ever read. I want to extend my deepest thanks to my girl Meredith for placing it in my borrowing hands. It's a fabulous reading experience that when explained verbally makes no sense. I'm sure that my breakdown of the plot structure didn't make anyone want to read it, but my neverending enthusiasm for the brilliance of the writer and all he accomplished in the 200+ pages of text probably did. Vonnegut is a genius of prose, and he handles a story that jumps back and forth through time and space like a kangaroo with a porcupine in its pouch with a delicate touch of dark humor that treads the boundary of the nearly ludicrous, but always stays this side of believable. It's an astonishing piece of anti-war sentiment that examines the life of Billy Pilgrim through the 4-dimensional eyes of time, seeing time and events therein as something that have always happened, is happening, and will always happen. This sets the time-hopping structure of the book.<br />The book is rooted in Billy Pilgrim's situation as a prisoner of war, held captive first in a run down little camp that is pretty much headed by the distinguished Englishmen who have come to know the Nazi soldiers as comrades in arms, and then he is moved to Dresden, Germany; the site of a massacre that the combined destructive power of which took more lives than the Hiroshima bomb. We find out that Billy Pilgrim also became a optometrist, married a rich woman, and may or may not have been taken to a planet called Tralfamadore to be put on display in a zoo for the interest of the planet's inhabitants, who teach Billy about the true nature of time.<br />I couldn't explain how or why this book drew me in with such power, but there is no doubt in my mind of its greatness. Vonnegut uses his characters to the anti-war angle splendidly, gives us some new perspectives about time to think about, and he sort of makes us feel guilty for wanting to chuckle at the snide moments of obscure humor he throws at us like eggs, and we're all the dumb football jock's car. It's a wonderful balancing act of psychological profiling, satire, theory, and love. This is a true timeless masterpiece.ckle at the snide moments of obscure humor he throws at us like eggs, and we're all the dumb football jock's car.

B00005R87Q|5.0|I walked into the theater not knowing exactly what to expect from this movie.  The action packed commercials had lured me into the film but not knowing much about cars, I wasn't too sure if I would understand everything.  This movie was everything its title promised to be, right from the beginning. The plot is simple-Brian Earl Spilner (I've seen this movie 8 times, I know by now), is an undercover cop who is assigned to learn more about Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his \\"team\\" of late night street racers. The goal is to find out if it was Dom's team or one of the other local racer packs who has been terrorizing California truckers, stealing their shipments. However, Spilner soon becomes part of the team and falls for Dom's sister. The movie continues as he tries to crack the case under the pressure of the FBI, police and suspicions of some of the racers.  <BR>    I am by no means a car afficianado now, but I can tell you that after seeing this movie I learned a LOT about cars.  I can't wait to find out about local underground car races and get involved.  Its easy for any viewer to recognize that the cars in this film are top quality and being an Eclipse lover, I was personally thrilled.  You can't possibly help get pumped up by the incredible racing scenes. Of course you can't discuss this movie without mentioning Gone in 60 Seconds, but this movie goes above and beyond that film in every aspect.  And girls, don't be weary, I know I thought it would be a total guy flick, but once you catch a peek at Vin Diesel and Paul Walker you'll be thankful to see this movie.

This is one of only two books on Web design that I recommend (I have read dozens).  This is not some doctoral tome with tons of pictures (it does have many good pictures, but they are useful ones).  This is not the latest full-page flash artist scheme.  This is good, quick, hands-on knowledge -- just like a good Webpage should be.  Read it and prosper.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Slowly over the years I have come to appreciate Guy Pearce as an actor more and more.  First, (to my knowledge) PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT - He is very strange and absolutely wonderful in this film.  It has become one of my all time favorites! Next, (I saw him in)LA CONFIDENTIAL - ROCK!  He plays a little pain in the buns that you can't help  but love/hate. Then, RAVENOUS - Whoah!  This is a crazy, delicious film!  I recommend it to anyone with a stomach on the strong side, again he rocks!  NOW, my loves, MOMENTO!!!!!  YAHOOOOO!  He is awesome.  This is very near a one man show staring my favorite actor!  The others in this flick are great also, Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of Matrix fame.  But our Guy hits the bullseye with this in depth look at a human beings inner thoughts.  Everything about this film is intriguing and fresh.  From the way it is filmed to the way it makes you think.  Not to mention the moments you burst out laughing (who would have thunk it?).  I can honestly say this went into my best bin along with Priscilla: Queen of the Desert.  Next up (and I am far too pumped about) The Count of Monte Cristo.  not only does Guy seem to be in a great role but the other actors/actrices seem to be great.  Also, (and I thought I was dreaming this one) in March 02, The Time Machine!  I can't believe my favorite actor and one of my favorite old movies coliding into a new movie.  AND IT EVEN LOOKS PRETTY GOOD!!!  So all in all Memento is awesome!  Definetly see the others for a taste of great film making and talent.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|It finally seems fashionable for Hollywood to treat the worlds created by authors, writers and now cyber-writers seriously and budget them accordingly.  Hence we have a strange set of leading characters as diverse as Wolverine(X-Men), Lora Croft, Harry Potter and Froto Baggins.<br />Worlds that were only fantasies come alive on the big screen to the delight of their respective fans and target audiences, but also to the chagrin of cynics and critics.<br />Nobody expects a James Bond or Terminator movie to explain Life's questions, or even to really explain all of the details in the book.  I've read Ian Flemming.  Show me where he ever really explains 007's motivation for constantly saving the world and engaging in shallow, meaningless sexual relationships?<br />Simon West takes Lora Croft's world seriously and actually does come up with a reasonable explaination for what would motivate an extraordinarily rich girl to constantly expose herself to incredible risks.  Mountain Dew commercials aside, there is a limit to what adrenalin and extreme sports will do for you.<br />Angelina Jolie leaves her stunt doubles sitting on the sidelines as she brings Lora Croft alive and leaves the audience cheering for more.<br />Like all who are really in the know, I left the movie knowing that the answer to &quot;Life, the universe and everything&quot; is 42 and that the leading character for the best &quot;James Bond&quot; movie I've ever seen, turned out to be a woman

B00003CX9E|5.0|A lot of the reviews here stew over Citizen Kane's place in history, its watchability for people who aren't film buffs, and all that. I'd come down on the side of this being an amazingly well-written, engaging movie, myself. Hey, I was one of those skeptics when I first saw Kane, but it's a great story, told in a really winning way, with fantastic acting and a real sense of honesty to everything about it.<br />Even leaving that alone, though -- wow, does this DVD ever understand what makes you want a DVD.<br />First of all, the image transfer is astonishingly clean. If you have an old tape of this movie, you're going to sit up in your chair three or four times and realize you never even saw this or that whole scene before; the images are that much clearer than your bleary old VHS copy. It has that visual zing that you get from really good DVDs.<br />Then there are the extras. You get a whole extra two hours' worth of the American Experience episode, which is extremely satisfying entertainment for anyone who's ever liked a televised biography. (American Experience bios are sometimes breathtakingly good, and this is a superb example.) You get original storyboards for scenes. You get letters from Orson Welles. You get studio memos from the censors. You get production photos. The two soundtracks' worth of commentary are quite different, complementing each other well, and both of them are good fun. (I wish Roger Ebert could stop talking long enough to breathe, or that the sound balance was a little lower [or less consistent] on him during his soundtrack, but he has a lot to offer.)<br />If you're on the fence, Kane is absolutely worth buying in this form. The only DVD I've been quite this impressed by is the Criterion Collection version of The Third Man, for similar reasons: superb restoration; loads of fun extras; and a dazzling, classic, complex and satisfying movie to begin with.
B00000FCBC|3.0|I bought this mainly for the Garage Days portion of the CD. The other CD is simply dissapointing at best with only a couple of songs worth listening to. If you already own Garage Days Revisited, don't bother with this 2CD afair.
0446608955|5.0|I remember when I read The Notebook that I started crying and didn't even know it. No book has been like that since--except this one. It's quick, it's simple but that doesn't take away from the fact that Sparks has created the type of love story that we need right now. It's not about something tortured, no sex, no violence, no anger, just something that actually grew out of respect, and turned into the type of teenage love that we might remember and the type of adult love that we all hope for. Jamie Sullivan is the type of person we perhaps strive to be, and Landon Carter may be the type of person we really are--we have our flaws but recognize the beauty and goodness of those that are better than us and that make us want to be better people. Some may say that this book is too simple--but maybe it is us that has made things too complicated.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica went over the board in trying to make this album musically challenging, so much so that they no longer enjoy playing these songs live. However, it worked, because this is by far their best album, and is not for the faint of heart.
B00005QZWJ|4.0|Nobody, simply NOBODY captures the mood of Tolkien's Middle-earth like Glass Hammer (The Middle Earth Album ).  But Howard Shore DOES capture the mood and feel of Jackson's movie.  He does a terrific job of staying out of the way - you don't notice the music so much, but it's there and driving the movie right along.  Enya is superb, and the music of Rivendell my favorite.  Once again, if you want to experience Middle-earth as Tolkien envisioned it, check out Glass Hammer.  But if you enjoyed the movie as much as I did, you'll certainly want to add this to your Tolkien collection.
B000002H97|3.0|This is not a bad Album, per say, but it's an album that put Metallica on the Radio, anf for true Metallica fans it wasn't what was expected after their previous 4 albums. There are some good songs on there, but I've heard much better music before. A must have for all Metallica hard core fans of their new era, but don't bother otherwise
B00005QG9J|3.0|I had high expectations for this album coming off the heels of one of the best cd's in the last decade \\"Make Yourself\\". My expectations were a little to high, but Morning View delivers a solid album with no filler.<br />The hard-hitting songs on this album are Blood on the Ground, Have You Ever and Under My Umbrella. Although they don't compare to the trio of Privilege, Nowhere Fast, and Consequence from Make Yourself, they're still pretty cool. The new stuff they try-out like Warning, Nice To Know You, Circles, Are You In?, and 11am aren't great a first listening, but they all grew on me (although I got sick of Are u in). <br />Mexico could of been one of the best Incubus songs in a while except that it drags out about a minute too long which makes me skip the track before it ends. Just A Phase is sick once it gets to the chorus and the build up is tight, but the lyrics aren't all that great (\\"they'll be throwin' quarters at you on stage\\"). <br />My favorite is the extremely strange and creative Aqeuous Transmission cuz it's just so relaxing and such a change of pace from everything else. The frogs at the end I don't get, but I can live with. Bottom Line: Very Good album but no classic like its predecessor. (Too Bad They Sold Out; but still better than most bands out there)
0525946284|2.0|From a Ken Follett fan of years, the last two books by Mr. Follett have been ridiculous. When he's on he's really on but when he's not it's a waste of money.   This book, much like the last one, has a very predictable plot, albeit hard to believe, and so disappointing.  Still hoping to see another good book from him.
B00005QDW1|5.0|A lot of steadfast no doubt fans don't seem to like this CD, but I certainly do. Its one of my favorite CDs to date. At first listen, I regretted wasting my money, but after a couple of listens I really got to appreciate what they put into on the CD. They co-wrote and co-produced every song on this CD which considering a lot of acts today is something very cool. Plus they weren't afraid to try something different which also deserves credit. BUT onto the music. I really like almost all the songs on the CD. They compliment eachother very well for a very distinct sound. Also they are mostly happy and upbeat which I like a lot. All very danceable. The standout tracks are definetly &quot;Hey Baby&quot; &quot;Detective&quot; and &quot;Running&quot; (A slightly slower song on the CD). They not only have awesome vocals (thank you Gwen), but the actual music is really cool sounding, too. Far from the usual ska, but not an unwelcome change. Anyway, I'll run through the tracks now. &quot;Hella Good&quot; is an upbeat song which has some really cool guitar riffs. &quot;Hey Baby&quot; (which you've probably heard on the radio) is a dance-able, arguably pop-y song, but very fun. &quot;Making Out&quot; is a cool song because it has a cool beat and I like how Gwen goes back and forth from singing to talking, etc. Gives it a cool sound. &quot;Underneath it All&quot; is a slower song featuring Lady Saw which gives it a cool reggae- 80's type sound. &quot;Detective&quot; is one of my favorite songs. Its got such cool melody and how it goes back and forth from sound to sound is awesome. &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; is a good song I think. Nothing really special, just kinda feel good music. &quot;Start the Fire&quot; also has the reggae-ish sound. I'm not too crazy about it, but its a dance-able song with an interesting rhythm. &quot;Running&quot; is the slowest song on the CD, but one of my favorites. It really grows on you after a while. &quot;In My Head&quot; is a very interesting little electronica- type thing. I like it a lot except for the &quot;In My head, its only in my head&quot; chorus. I find it annoying. &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; is a very odd little mix in which I understand absolutely nothing of the song, but its got a cool melody and most of the time Gwen's voice is drowned out by the background music. &quot;Waiting Room&quot; is probably my least favorite song on the CD. Its too weird for my taste, but it goes out to all those Prince fans because he co-wrote and produced it. &quot;Rock Steady&quot; is a nice song. Very feel-good. Not much to say about it. Well, to sum up, I think its a great CD and you should buy it if you're into this kind of stuff. But if you like the old No Doubt, don't look here.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|I will not be so snobby and say that my opinion garners serious attention.  My opinion is my own and I hold no ill feeling to those that enjoyed this movie.  In fact I enjoyed it myself for the most part, but in my opinion, I walked from this movie with nothing.  It was entertaining to see how the movie progressed.  The story that unfolded backward was ingenious, but rough getting started.  The performances were excellent, as was the script.  Guy Pearce, Cary-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano all carry the movie so well.  My problem is that the entire movie gets you to sympathize with the character and by the end, you're not sure what to think.  I don't want to give much away by saying anymore.  The movie is obviously leaning toward being artistic, and that's fine.  And I do know something about art, I was an art major in college.  I guess my beef is that the movie is dark and down in it's tone, and many people will not find it entertaining in that respect.  Movies in general are supposed to entertain and with that said, if you don't find dark, moody, twisted and surreal entertaining, you probably won't find this all that much fun to watch.  Myself, I tend to sit on the fence between artistic and entertaining and this movie leans too much toward artistic.
0375420525|2.0|... and yet this isn't one of them. At this point you may look at those tiny two stars I gave Danielewski's book and think that I've got no clue what I'm talking about.<BR>There IS method in my madness, which can hardly be said about the author of this most contradictory (mind you, I did not say &quot;complex&quot;) book that would definetly look better in an art gallery rather than on my bookshelf, next to Stephen King's novels. Here's why I think this book is worth reading if and only IF you have plenty of free time on your hands. <BR>The House of Leaves is supposed to work on so many levels that it eventually fails on pretty much each and everyone of them. The only part that's actually interesting (psychobabble and page layout aside) is the book within the book, the story of the fictional (?)  Navidson Record. The rest is pretty much crap. Johnny Truant bugged the hell out of me and by the time he's had sex with the fifth or sixth woman both him and his rambling become boring (that is of course, if you're not into porn).<BR>Danielewski (or Zampano, or ... whatever!) does a great job of creating a good premise with some pretty sharp characters (The Navidsons) and then screwing everything up with pompous &quot;I'm so much smarter than you and I can write all this symbolic, choked-full with details and names, mumbojumbo that you probably don't get and don't care about but you'll just pretend so that you don't seem denser than carbon&quot; style. <BR>If you give up on Truant's foot notes and skip the pages that deal with technicalities, it may stil be not such a waste of time after all... which could explain some of the 5 star reviews I've read. But my main problem with &quot;The House of Leaves&quot; is that it's not for one moment neither &quot;thrilling&quot; nor &quot;breathtakingly creepy&quot;, as some reviwers claim. As for &quot;intelligent&quot;, that's up to you to decide...<BR>There is one questions that arises: what if some &quot;avangard&quot; Hollywood(or indie) producer decides to make a movie about a guy who finds a fictional book about a fictional (?) movie... Then we're in the deep do-do!
B00005RFAI|5.0|After listening to the samples I decided to buy this CD and I'm glad I did.  Pink puts her soul into songs like &quot;Family Portrait&quot; and just has a good time with songs like &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; and &quot;Missundaztood&quot;.  All in all this is a very good CD.  It's very easy to listen to.
B00000JGOJ|4.0|This is a cute little piece of loosely-tied vignettes that give several of today's hot actors the chance to actually ACT (not one car chase, alien abduction or plot to destroy the world in evidence).  We receive insight into the lives and phobias of three sisters (Anderson, Jolie, Stowe) for the few days leading up to their parents' (Connery, Rowlands) anniversary marriage vow renewal.  Ryan Phillippe, Dennis Quaid and Jon Stewart really steal the show as the love interests.  Phillippe and Jolie are believable and sweet as a twenty-something couple with some pretty large issues making the L.A. club scene while Anderson and Stewart are good as thirty-something professionals trying to get through the scar tissue created by past romantic disasters.  Quaid, however gives the best performance when he sets out to prove to himself that he's not the boring, unimaginative husband Stowe thinks him to be.  Jay Mohr and Ellen Burstyn also shine in a wonderfully poignant subplot involving a mother-son relationship.  It was especially nice to see Mohr in a softer role - I recall all of his previous characters as selfish, crude S.O.B.s.  This movie reminds me of the days before special effects where the story was the star.
B0000509BZ|4.0|This is the movie that started it all!  Christopher Lambert, in one of his best roles, plays the immortal Connor MacLeod, who is stabbed during a Scottish battle and mysteriously survives.  Sean Connery plays Juan Ramirez, another immortal who mentors MacLeod and prepares him for an immortal life.  Great special effects for its time and excellent swordfights makes this film stand out over other action/sci-fi movies.  This movie spawned three sequels and a T.V. series, but none of them are as good as the original Highlander.  If you are an action movie fan, a sci-fi fan, or a Lambert fan, then you must see this great movie!
B00005Q45W|5.0|not a fan of leonard cohen, but this disc has me thinking that i've been missing out.  simply put, it is easy to listen to.  &quot;ten new songs&quot; is a welcome breath of fresh air filled with interesting melodies, thought provoking lyrics and an escape from what the masses call music these days.  check out &quot;here it is&quot; and &quot;the land of plenty&quot; for a sample.  it is all good.  very good.
0786867973|5.0|This is the most beautiful cookbook I have ever owned!  The coconut cake on page 23 is wonderful as well as the recipe for Mulled Wine on page 269.  I have a cookbook library and this is by far the prettiest to look at inside and out.  The recipes are easy to follow and superb.  Thank you Nigella!  Bon Apetite!
B00005U2LM|5.0|Personally...I thought that the last album from Wu...&quot;The W&quot; was not at all close to some of the best rap ever written which was on the first two group albums and some of the solo ones...&quot;Iron Flag&quot; though not their best album ever, really brings back to the fans what we love...Good lyrics...tight beats...that original Wu-Tang style...This album is great...A must buy for true rap fans... <BR>                                -J.L.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This CD comes with everyting you love about prince and his creative musical talent. It goes from mellow to dance to spritual a little something for everyone.  This reminds me of the good old days when you bought a album and enjoyed it from front to back. Some particular favorites include Muse 2 the Pharaoh, 1+1+1=3, She loves me for me and Family Name.  It's all good for faithful Prince fans I guarantee you won't be disappointed you'll love it!
B000002UDD|5.0|I have always liked Metallica over Megadeth. But I really have to hand it to them on this album. It has some amazing guitar work and includes my favorite Megadeth song, In My Darkest Hour. Yeah, you can say it's a little cheesy, but 80's cheese is cool. Overall, this album is solid and will always remain a thrash classic.

B00005A46T|1.0|This is absolute ....  All of nu-metal is.  Grown men scream and play the most terribly uninteresting guitar I have ever heard.  Period.  And they're ugly.  This isn't music, and I sincerely hope nobody fools themselves or anybody else fools them into believing it is.  If you want to call yourself a rock fan, then listen to real rock....
B00005R2M3|5.0|This album is great. The songs have enough rock sound, and it isn't &quot;pop&quot; the way Britney Spears' &quot;Britney&quot; album is. Shakira has not made any compromises in going English. None of the songs are slow or boring. I love Shakira's voice - it's very distinctive, with a nice Spanish accent.
B00005UK1F|5.0|Green Carnation's first release &quot;journey to the end of the night&quot; wasn't widley received by anyone.  And it's a shame for the only reason i own &quot;light of day, day of darkness&quot;  is due to my just happing to stumble on a copy of journey to....  Though the first release is no where near the opus this one is it is still amazing and should be sought after.  As for this one in comparison to the first, there is significant change and all for the better.  All but gone is the ever present opera vocal beauty of thier frist release, but it was to make room for emotional music and strong male vocals occasionally backed by a female.  though this cd is magnificent in both quality and quantity, i do miss the incessant opera beauty of the first cd.  Best advice; buy the cd, light some candles, turn out the lights, and rock yourself to the ultimate emotional and physical release for very few will understand this, much in the same way as &quot;black aria&quot; by Danzig, yet those of us who do get it and love it will gladly extend a hand to those of you who do not yet understand the magnificence of music's power and motivation.
B00005JRX0|5.0|This is a great way to combine AC/DC's newest album and their smashing concerts. AC/DC live is a must see, it can't be descibed without being seen.<BR>I'm a great fan of AC/DC and I can really recommend this record
0811826848|4.0|Have read more than my fair share of Beatle books. Aside from a wealth of insider material (wanna see hotel receipts and personal memo's up the Yingyang? Me either...)that are, at times, hard to see due to them being used as graphic embellishment. It's a pretty standard Beatle read. <BR>McCartney has once-again assured his position as group polite guy, while practicing generous amounts of retro-histroy. To hear him tell it, HE was the artsy one with John coming in and taking his 'scraps' as it were. Paul seems to resent not being cannonized the way John has been. Sorry Paul, gotta die for that.<BR>There are some very nice photos here, but really, for something that feels like such a tome it sure comes off as a Rolling Stone fluff piece.<BR>Exercise caution. Get a bargain on the price if you can.<BR>I would not use the term essential OR definitive. I think I enjoyed &quot;Shout!&quot; by Philip Norman better.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This CD was an impulse buy, and I couldn't be happier w/ my purchase.  It has the calming acoustical sounds that are (just as the title claims) soulful.  And India's lyrics are heartfelt and inspirational.  This fresh new sound is a wonderful addition to any CD collection.  <br />&quot;Video&quot; was the song that hooked me on India, but I've fallen in love w/ many other tracks on this album.  &quot;Ready for Love&quot; seems to be written from my soul instead of hers!  But &quot;Beautiful&quot; is by far my favorite track, just listen to it once and you'll agree.  And really, I could list every song here and tell you why I love it... but that may make this review a bit lengthy!<br />I'll just tell you that if you go out and buy this CD you will not be disappointed!
B00005QXXO|4.0|This CD, like virtually everything Radiohead, requires a bit of an investment by the listener at first. It didn't grab me by the throat, but then after listening a couple of times one starts to become amazed at what Radiohead are bringing to the live shows.<BR>It struck me several times while listening how tight they are as a band and how simply so much of the dense material from Kid/Amnesiac breaks down. They do some really amazing things here, it's nice to have it on disk.<BR>Would have liked to have another 5 or 6 tracks, maybe at least a COUPLE from o.k. computer.<BR>Here's hoping they start rockin again. Getting real tired of all the electronic mewling and crybaby sketches on the incomprehensable covers.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I purchased this CD awhile ago, and I'm not sure why I didn't get the chance to listen to it.  But finally a few months ago I put it in my CD player and it hasn't come out yet!  <br />Sarah's lyical talent is amazing.  And her voice is so unique and wonderful.  <br />&quot;Hold On,&quot; &quot;Good Enough,&quot; &quot;I Love You,&quot; &quot;Do What You Have to Do,&quot; and &quot;The Path of Thorns&quot; were never released singles... but should've been!  I absolutely adore these songs and play them over and over!  I seem to be able to attach a part of my life to each one of them, and you probably will be able to do the same.
0385505833|5.0|I love all John Grisham books, and I was surprised to see he had written such a silly book.  I absolutely loved this book, however, I would have told my daughter, no way baby, Dad and I are going on a trip!  It was funny through out and you can read it in two days, good humor for your Christmas blues!
0345413377|5.0|As I said, I am so sick of hearing about how horrible and ungodly The Amber Spyglass is. Let me adress it issue by issue:<BR>     1) &quot;Mr. Pullman portrays God as a simple old fool. He obviously hates the church.&quot; How do you know how Mr. Pullman feels? Have you asked him about it? It's called a work of fiction, my dears. As in IT'S NOT REAL. Who says that just because Philip Pullman writes this stuff, that that's what he believes in?<BR>     2) &quot;The first two books were great, but The Amber Spyglass was just pagan slop.&quot; If the book was so awful, then how did it get nominated for the Booker Prize in Britain? <BR>     3) &quot;The message is stupid, it's telling people to rejectreligion!&quot; Actually, the book is saying that even though we are sinful, it is worth it because that is what gives us our free will. Without it, we would be kind of like mindless machines. I think this is what the Spectres do. They consume a person's soul and take away their free will. The state they are left in is what humans would be like without sin.<BR>     The Amber Spyglass is one of the best book ever written. The message is great, the writing superb, and and the plot romantic and wonderful. I have no idea where I would be without the His dark Materials series, they are what got me into reading.
0061092037|5.0|Wow!  This was one of the most exciting novels I have read in a long time.  I kept thinking as I was reading it how many of my friends would enjoy it, too.  It's a Kane and Abel-type story, the clash of two titans in the newspaper business.  What I loved the most about it was all the twists and turns of one-upmanship that each was able to pull on the other!  This author's knowledge of the business world, and of human nature is just astounding.
B00004RJ74|5.0|Okay, let's face it...Tarantino kicks as usual, Clooney takes a different turn by PUTTING them in the ER for a change,<BR>Keitel got soft here, Lewis is OK, (but still not my dreamgirl),<BR>Trejo is the man again, the dude with the \\"Assault on Precinct 13\\" t-shirt has come and gone, but the flick is still on the shelf in the \\"kick ...\\" section!!!!<BR> Must confess, the concept of the Gecco Brothers on the run is far more interesting than vampires, which have been reused and reabused for the last million years!!!!! Still loved it thanks to the double DVD including \\"Full Tilt Boogie\\" (aka \\"The making of From Dusk Till Dawn\\")  See this flick !!!<BR>Just as much as I'd ... to see a prequel of Reservoir Dogs showing the fouled robbery, I'd ... to see a prequel of this one showing the Gecco Bros demented  killing and hostage spree.<BR>Oh by the way, ramblers.. leave Dusk 2, 3, 4, and any other ... on the dusty shelf, right next to \\"Pay It Forward\\" and \\"Scream 2, 3\\", maybe even \\"1\\" !!!!!!!!
B00003CXTG|5.0|I went to see Pearl Harbor at the cinema, and i was blown away, the storyline had me hooked from the minute i saw two little farm boys playing in a make shift plane. It was one of the most emotional three hours of my life, how could you not empathise with these people. Things like that really happened, men really were trapped in ships such as the Arizona and that is why i took such an interest. Maybe it did have something to do with the fact that Josh Hartnett was in it, but it did me the world of good, it made me realsie the importance of innocence, life and to appreciate what i have in life. It's an eye opening experience, but i feel i've learnt something. I watch it at least three times a week, it makes me laugh, makes me cry, but God does it make me glad to be growing up now!
B00005RHGK|1.0|Jeez, I can't even believe I paid ($) to rent it, yet alone ($) for the tape to put it on, no-scares, no-good scenes, no-nothin'!<BR>Just another example of what the last 5 years of movies have to offer not since Blair Witch have audiences been conned so badly. Guess what? movies are the only item you can pay for and never get your money back if you're not satisfied (and they know that)!  Through strategic marketing, previews, pre-release \\"hype\\" and god knows what other good scamming techniques they use, they get the opening weekend they want, laugh at you, make $ and move on.<BR>This was so disappointing, I barely remember it!<BR>This makes \\"Scream 3\\" look like a masterpiece! (and that blew, as usual)<BR>If you are suffering from INSOMNIA, rent \\"Jeepers Creepers\\", \\"I Know What(..) Last Summer\\" and play a double feature .... nighty night
0060926317|1.0|This is a fictionalized redo of Shakti Gawain's &quot;Creative Visualization&quot; (which you are better off reading, - at least you will get your New Age information straight on), stilted and artificially done.  The best that can be said about it is it's short and easily read.
B00003CXXR|5.0|While it's obvious the JURASSIC PARK dynamo is wearing down,this was still a fun and enjoyable 90 minutes. The dinosaurs again are the real stars, and there are some really remarkable creations in this one, too.<br />The plot is standard B-movie fare, and I still don't know how Laura Dern knew where Sam Neill was calling from.  Caller ID?  At any rate, in movies like this, the plot and the acting become incidental.  If you just want to have fun and get a few jolts and laughs, &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; fits the bill nicely.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I'm not big on Musicals and sappy love stories but this movie was GREAT!!!. The songs all fit in to the story and were sung well, the story was great, and it was even funny at times. There are also so many extra features on this DVD which makes it that much better. I bought this for my wife, and I think I liked it more than she did.
B00005R87Q|1.0|This movie is plain terrible.<br />Anybody ever seen Point Break, this movie is a copy. They just use a different instrument. In Point Break it was surfers and here it's F and F its cheap cars. eclipse's and civic's? lol. Comon guys. The acting sucks!!! How can you say this movie was good. Pearl Harbor was even better then this. I've seen every movie since back in the day, and wow this one is def. in the bottom 10 worst
B00005R2IS|5.0|The best low buget film ever.I liked a lot.With great extras and the original australian soundtrack this version will enhance the original.<br />The first time I saw in my country I get overwhelmed.The cars the chases the roads,magnificent spectacle.<br />I recommend to you.
B0000009N1|5.0|Without a doubt, this is some of Frank's finest work. This is where Frank begins to take the music business to school. Challenging all comers. The guitar work is impeccable. Once again Frank is hiding musical genius under repulsive lyric, making you the listener work for it. Just as hard as he did composing, writing and arranging it. The rewards are there however, you just have to listen for them. The variations in style and meter within the confines of a single track are mind numbing. The statistical density of the poly-rhythms used herein was outright intimidating to most of the popular &quot;rock&quot; musicians of the day, and for that matter still is to this day. Most of America didn't quite know what box to put this body of work into. When one contrasts the harsh gritty vocal's Captain Beefheart brings to &quot;Willie the Pimp&quot; alongside the raspy yet catchy violin melody interwoven with Franks genius lyric &quot;tryin' to buy pussy with a third party check&quot; it causes one to rethink ones taste in music and ponder the question &quot;How the hell does Kid Rock make a living doing the same thing?&quot; Is America really that dumb all over?
B00003CXTF|2.0|The visual impact of the attack is without a doubt an amazing achievement, but the storyline of this movie is painful and amateurish. I appreciate the idea of doing an old fashioned movie, but emulating the style of the classic war movie does not mean trudging out every cliche of the genre without some creative revision.  If you want to see a quaint revision of the old style war movie, rent Memphis Belle.<br />This movie is more like the cast of Friends facing the ravages of War.  I almost gave up on this movie only 20 minutes into it, but I was able to hold on until the attack on Pearl Harbor.  While that scene is clearly stunning, I should have quit before putting in disc 2 (why the director didn't also quit then is a mystery to me).<br />War movies need a human side, but few movies artfully integrate this with the images of war.  Saving Private Ryan, which also stunned audiences with its realism, was far from perfect, the typical Speilberg morality play left the Germans without much of a face and tugged a bit too hard on the hearstrings, but at least the characters came across as more genuine and the story avoided the worst of the soap opera plot devices.<br />Its a shame this movie couldn't take a simpler approach to examining the war's impact on humanity.  As it stands, the movie is a lot like the Titanic epic; it's long on visual detail short on subtle human revelations.
B0000524CY|5.0|The Exorcist Was a great movie.  This one's even better.  One of the deleted scenes was the vamous &quot;Spider Walk.&quot;  That I think was the scariest part of the movie.  Other scenes of the movie are'nt that amusing.  The oringinal plot was a great movie.  The deleted scenes in the book like &quot;The Spider Walk.&quot; The book said that when she came down the stairs she flicked her tongue like a weird snake.  But in the movie she got down the stairs and spit out blood.  If you find my review helpful vote for me. Thank You!

B00000JPH5|5.0|This cult movie had probably stood the test of time to become one of the all-time greats of fantasy cinema.  In 'Labyrinth' Jennifer Connoly is a typical teen, torn between adults that don't understand her and her baby brother that she resents having to babysit for.  Her flitting wish for her brother to be spirited away by goblins comes true though, and an 'Alice In Wonderland'-type story follows when she realises her responsibilities.<br />The best thing that this movie has going for is probably Jennifer Connoly, a fantastic actress that's finally beginning to make it in Hollywood after performances in 'Requiem For A Dream' and 'A Beautiful Mind'.  Here she manages just the right amount of angst, frustration and vulnerability of our teenage heroine.  David Bowie plays the goblin king in a shameless role of self-promotion, but since the goblin king is over-the-top anyway, this actually kind of fits.  The world itself meanwhile is absolutely magical.  Created by Jim Henson's Creature Workshop, it's dazzling to watch.  Thankfully it's completely free of cutesy creatures - everything in 'Labyrinth' is ugly, evil or both.  I particularly liked the small ogre at the beginning that kills the dainty little fairies.  There are also some relatively troubling ideas here to say that this is often referred to as a children's movie.  For instance, the Escher-like hands that reach out of the wall and several menacing creatures along the way.<br />Alongside this totally immersing fantasy world though, are side-issues of the journey of adolescense which, whilst clear, are never rammed down your throat.  Wonderfully performed, realised and completely watchable, 'Labyrinth' is a classic of its genre.
0783229526|1.0|Damn!  When I went into this, I figured \\"Okay, Terry Gilliam, great director, Johnny Depp, good actor, should be funny and at least all right.  ....  It is funny in the beginning, especcially Depp's drugged-out warning \\"We can't stop here, this is bat country!\\", but after about 20 minutes or so you realize that it's just one drawn-out drug trip and the only question on your mind (well, my mind anyway) is \\"When will it end?\\"  To Depp's credit, he does do a good acting job under the circumstances (I hardly even recognized him with his bald head), but the story was just bad and Terry Gilliam has a tendency to keep his films going long after they should have ended (in the case of this one, it should have stopped when he got the script).  All in all this was a most disappointing movie experience; if it came out a couple years after the novel did, it probably would have done well, but not in today's world.  Sorry.
B000002KD9|5.0|This was Neil Youngs third solo album although whether you can call it a true solo album when you have Crazy Horse backing you is open to debate. And i welcome fellow future reviewers to debate this minor point. Anyway it isnt important. What is important is the music. nils lofgren plays on this album. Of the 11 tracks on this 10 are neil compositions, the other one is a cover of don gibsons Oh lonesome me. I dont know the original but this is a good if sad song. The standout tracks of a generally very good album are the title track and Southern Man which prompted a response from Lynyrd Skynnyrd with SWeet Home Alabama. They thaught Neil was slagging the south. Either way it is a class number. Is this a better album then Harvest. Well Harverst was more successful commercially but i think this is a better album and in my humble opinion is his best early album along with Deja Vu released the same year as this one with Crosby,Stills and Nash and Zuma from 1975. This is a class album and a great introduction to the legend that is Neil Young.<BR>  I got this album after i heard a reference made to it in a film. Cate blanchette thaught billy bob thorntons character looked like neil young from  his After the Gold Rush album. I was intrigued enough to go out and check it out. I am glad i did and glad i saw that film. Neil young is a legend and this album, Harvest, Zuma and Tonights the night will tell you why.
B000002HJA|5.0|I am a latercomer to Kyuss's music, I found out about them after getting hooked on Queens of the Stone Age. I discovered that Josh Homme (Queens Singer/Guitarist) was also the man behind Kyuss so I checked them out.......and boy I am glad I did.<br />There is a lot of debate among Kyuss fans as to which of their albums is the best, I personally love them all and find it hard to compare any of them. My favourite Kyuss song is 'Gardenia' off Sky Valley due to its incredible heaviness and groove.<br />However, this album 'And the circus leaves town..' is a masterpiece. You can really see what direction Josh Homme was planning on taking after Kyuss as he introduced a lot more melody on this album.<br />Their have also been mumblings on some reviews about the singer, John Garcia, I personally think his voice matches the songs perfectly and both music and vocals complement each other nicely.<br />Standout songs on the album are 'One Inch Man' , 'Tangy Zizzle', 'Size Queen', 'Catamaran' and the incredible 'Spaceship Landship'<br />The latter of those is a monster of a track and is arguably one of the best hard rock songs of all time.......it simply rocks like a ...!!<br />There are also some really cool instrumentals and this album, in particular 'Jumbo Blimp Jumbo' which is shows off Josh's amazing guitar ability.<br />In fact that is the one thing that stands out in all of Kyuss's albums, yes the drums are superb and the bass is f**king incredible but the guitar playing is out of this world and Josh really is a guitar god.<br />If you are new to Kyuss I would get this album and 'Sky Valley' first and then work back to 'Blues for the Red Sun' and 'Wretch'<br />I have just added their 'greatest hits' album to my collection although it is mainly full of live tracks and rough cuts that didn't make it on to their proper albums.....still worth a purchase though as anything Kyuss did was awesome.<br />Don't delay......buy today.<br />And if you are into the whole desert/stonerrock thing then check out Karma to Burn and Queens of the Stone Age who are two of my favourite bands.
B000002I25|5.0|This was the debut doors album released in 1967 and is in my opinion the best along with strange days. All the best doors numbers are here with light my fire and the end being the centerpieces. My personal favourite is Whiskey bar(alabama song) which is their version of kurt briecholds Mahoganny. I also like twentieth century fox which is about ray manzareks girlfriend Dorothy. Simple psychedlic music at its best. Jim morrison and the doors rock. What a debut. Should u buy it? Yes. Dont question just get it.
0783117523|5.0|Have you ever been so lonely and bored that drinking or smoking or altering your state of mind seems like a good idea? Gia argues against that thought. Remarkably anti-drug, it features harrowing scenes of drug use, complete with infected heroin needles, popping veins, and even scarier depictions of the way drugs affect our mind and emotions. Based on the life of the late 80's supermodel/lesbian/heroin addict/AIDS victim, Gia Carangi (Angelina Jolie) this HBO film can't be so much labeled as an \\"issue\\" movie, although it clearly encompasses themes of anti-drug, anti-modeling industry, pro-gay, pro-AIDS awareness, and covers them more powerfully and with more artism than most films can do with just one of those heavy topics. When the tragic ending comes, Gia casts a dark, powerful spell. Kudos to Angelina Jolie and especially Elizabeth Mitchell as Gia's caring lover, Linda, now a near vet on playing lesbians.
B00003CXE7|1.0|Thin on dialogue and plot. OK for fans of action movies, which I'm not. Cecil B. DeMille did this kind of thing more colorfully.
B0000041Z5|5.0|There may be argument among Brahms aficionados whether these Solti/Chicago sessions were the pinnacle of the performing of the Brahms Symphonies, but as a package, this 4 disk set is a superb investment for any Brahms lover. The performance is solid and Solti uses the orchestra's full dynamic range masterfully. What sets this set above others is the high quality of the recording. Excellent soundstage and dynamics. All sections are well balanced. Background noise is totally absent; the orchestra comes out of a black velvet silence. I don't know whether this was studio or auditorium recorded, but the acoustics are first rate. Its a great example of the \\"golden days\\" of recording.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I'm real quick with my reviews: First ten to fifteen minutes, Oh, I'm juiced! Then, NOT SCARY! PRE -'oh so'- DICTABLE! The ending left me saying, literally, &quot;What the Fuh...? My God, how stupid! Was that supposed to be scary?!?  Did my DVD skip a chapter? Why can't ANYONE make a scary movie anymore?&quot;
B000002NCW|4.0|Before listening to this album, I was bracing myself for something fairly horrific; I was expecting synthetic Celtic blandness, but I'm glad to say that behind the smooth 90's production, Oldfield's brilliance shines through. As I add Oldfield albums to my collection, I'm really beginning to wonder if he's ever made a genuinely bad record - admittedly, I've never heard \\"Heaven's Door\\", one he allegedly tossed off to get out of his Virgin recording contract. But I do think that this is a quality record; if you like Oldfield's music, and you give this one a chance without the expectation of getting something ground-breaking or challenging, it will prove rewarding. <br />It has its ups and downs - \\"Women of Ireland\\" sounds like the Ghost of Enya hijacked the recording studio, but I totally concur with previous reviewers that the final track, \\"Mont St Michael\\", stands comparison with anything else he's done. I don't agree with some that say its the only decent thing on the record; I love the opening track, and I was pleasantly surprised to find his guitar playing more strongly in evidence than I thought it would be from some reviews. The fact that I love traditional Celtic tunes like \\"She Moved Through the Fare\\" helps some for sure, but I'm forgiving Mike for trying to emulate the Michael Flatley/Celtic Warrior look on the cover, and happily adding it to my growing collection of Mike Oldfield CDs.
B00000J2PH|5.0|No matter at what age I hear Carol King's Tapestry music, I am right back there at the first moment her music made its initial impression on me -- WHAT A THRILL  :-)  This is the music that means innocence and angst of youth and hope for the future all wrapped up in one (for me).  If you ever liked the ALBUM (showing my age), by all means pick up the CD.  I will treasure this one forever...
0316236535|5.0|My boisterous just-turned-two son absolutely loves this book!  We get loud and crazy and have made up hand motions to go along with each page.  The fun nature of the text cleverly disguises a lesson in color recognition--bonus!  If your child is anything like mine, this book will need to be enjoyed with a parent--the pages have cut-out sections.  My son would have them torn to shreds in no time if we left it in his hands without supervision.  This book is a winner!
6300270424|5.0|What an orgasmic experience. This is probably the only semi-decent concert footage of Led Zeppelin out there. Why the hell would any real fan turn it down. Yes, whoever directed this thing was probably on a serious acid trip, but who cares? It's Zeppelin!!!!!!!! So worth it!
B00003CWTI|5.0|I was first introduced to PTA via &quot;Boogie Nights.&quot;  If you liked that film, you should love &quot;Magnolia.&quot;  Paul Thomas Anderson (fans call him PTA) sees life through the eyes of a film-maker.  He gets his actors to act in ways you never thought they could.  he gives them lines and films them in ways that draw you into their lives.  Boogie Nights made me feel deeply for the porn actors it portrayed, and Magnolia made me love the deeply flawed individuals who haunted it.  If you watch this film without crying, your heart has gone cold and black.  Pay attention.  That is the message.  You have to pay as much attention to this film as PTA pays to his characters, and their situations, families, lives.  Yes, it's a morality play at a time when we need morality plays.  There is a right and a wrong, and strange things happen, but there is justice, and peace, and love after the rain of frogs.  <br />Magnolia itself is a rain of frogs, and nothing will ever be the same for you once you've succumbed to this beautiful, disturbing storm of emotions.
0441003257|4.0|I first heard of Good Omens while catching up on what my favorie director,Terry Gilliam, was up to (he is to direct the film starting in the sping of this year).Good omes is a very funny and well contrived piece full of wild imagery only Gilliam will be able to pull off.  I would have given this a 5 star rating except for the fact that it feels as though it carries on a little too long.  What could have been said in one page ....takes sevral to convey it's message.  <BR>The book is extreemly funny and has several really cool music refrences as well. Over all...this is a must read especially if you are a fan of Gilliam's and Monty Python.
630025111X|3.0|The tape I received was a disappointment. The movie, Monte Walsh was shot in Panivision and I assumed would be done so on the tape. Not true. The tape is blurry and the sound seems to have been restained. I taped this movie sometime ago from TV and after viewing the &quot;New Tape&quot; found the tape I recorded much better. In the introduction for instance I can read Momma Cass in full. On the new tape one of the s's is left off. The technical info from Amazon or Inetvideo is non-existent. What gives?
B00005OM4Q|1.0|A root canal is less painful than sitting through this piece of tripe. It is absolutely mindboggling that ANYONE could possibly like this movie -- yet look at all these glowing reviews. Man, what is wrong with these people? Have their brains turned to mush?<br />I despised this movie. I felt dirty for having watched the whole thing. There is nothing even remotely interesting happening at any point in this horrible, horrible waste of celluloid. The characters -- every single one of them -- lack any depth whatsoever. The acting is mediocre at best. Every attempt at humor falls completely flat. But the most despicable thing about this movie -- beyond the boring script, beyond the annoying Kate Hudson and the irritating little peach-faced journalist guy (So cute! So innocent! -- is the fact that Cameron Crowe takes 70s Rock and Roll, sucks it dry of any sense of excitement, and basically covers it all with a nice, thick layer of molasses. <br />If you think a life of rock and roll is this sweet and tame, you're an idiot.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Does the film deliver as entertainment? Yes. That is the bottom line. Does it deliver for historical accuracy? Well...pretty much.<br />I am glad the movie includes lesser known, real life characters and their exploits. Have to give the filmmakers credit for that. It also captures the real feel of the 40s, where travel and communications aren't like they are today. The scene where the nurses arrive at Pearl Harbor is great. They are wide-eyed in this place they had never seen or been to before. I thought that was a good touch.<br />Love story- lots of reviewers mention the cheesy love story. As a 36 yr old, I have no idea just how difficult relationships are in times of war. I thought PH actually did a good job portraying the conflict of feelings, and how one deals with the uncertainties of wartime romance. The phenomenal Battle of Britain scenes help keep the movie from bogging down until the immediate build up to the Pearl Harbor attack.<br />Glad it ends with the Doolittle Raid- that story deserves each and every opportunity to remind the world about those incredibly brave sailors and airmen. Also glad scenes of the Eagle Squadron at the Battle of Britain are included as a way to remember those brave american volunteer airmen that helped the British in their most desperate hour. <br />Remembering the film is entertainment...sit back and enjoy the aerial scenes and turn up the volume!
0140288503|5.0|Black Hawk Down tells the story of what actually happened in somalia with a level of detail not found in most military history books. This book gets you on the ground hearing and seeing what the guys who were there saw. A great book, honoring those who fought and died, and making a point as to not forget what happened in somalia.<BR>I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys military history, this book is a rare treat and should be read by all.
0451204530|4.0|Interesting premise?  Absolutely.  Easy read?  You bet.  Contains obvious and sloppy mistakes?  Yes.  Predictable?  About halfway through.  Why four stars?  I enjoyed Luke as a character.  Some have questioned his &quot;luck&quot; at finding out his identity so quickly.  I did not at all.  His is supposed to be a brilliant human being and used that intelligence to his advantage.  Billie possessed both strength and vulerability. Finally, it was simply a fun read with a very interesting premise.  Sometimes you just have to overlook mistakes or you miss out on something enjoyable.
B0000508U6|5.0|As women will tell, men have a hard to showing a little weakness. Hearing this kind of compelling, wrenching, and honest self-deliverance to love from a raspy, strong male voice is enough to make to strongest of any sex re-evaluate their own convictions of love. Coldplay rakes your emotions over the coals and you don't even know it until the last note of the last song. That's what I call one of the best CDs - EVER. If this is what PMS is like for a woman, then give me the WHOLE bottle of drugs. WHEW!
B000003TB6|4.0|yes. this cd is great. lots of jazz inspired hip hop beats. organic. blackthought has mad flow. i like it. i like illadelph probably more, though. still, this album is sooo good. i love it.
B000002B9I|5.0|Gloria's second Spanish release has to be her most exciting (along with 1998's Gloria!)  The songs have a very authentic Latin sound.  It's almost like she took the last song from Mi Tierra and continued on with the songs on Abriendo Puertas.    <br />The songs have a New Year's and Christmas theme, with messages about starting over, sending good wishes, as well as about just having fun.  &quot;Mas Alla&quot; is the softest number, so lovely it brings a tear to your eye.  &quot;Farolito&quot; is the most interesting, because of its tribal blend of chanting and rhythmic hand claps.  <br />There are many different Latin and Caribbean styles, which Gloria has written about prior to the lyrics of each song.  She tells what styles you'll hear in the particular song, where they come from, and the instruments that are used to get a particular sound.  <br />This one isn't translated like her two other Spanish CD's are.  So, even though you may not get the lyrics, the message of loving life is clear throughout the entire CD.
B00000DLVA|5.0|All I have to say, is that this is an absolutely beautiful album that is produced with such perfection. The seamless beats of the songs entrance me every time I hear this album.  <br />Favorites include : Erase/Rewind, Hanging Around and Junk of the Hearts. <br />Every track is well worth the price and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys electronic/alternative music. It is a refined album, yet comforting to listen to. Amazing! If you are waiting to listen to something different, yet beyond perfect, get this cd!!
B000007MVL|4.0|With ofcourse a few exceptions, I noticed that there are many, many people who share the same opinion concerning Kate Bush's music. Hounds Of Love is her masterpiece, and Lionheart is her weakest achievement. A load of ..., if you ask me. Hounds Of Love is Kate Bush getting weak, while Lionheart is the perfect 2nd album. First there was The Kick Inside, not really my favorite, which drew the attention because of Wuthering Heights. But the rest of the songs... I don't know. They're good, but they're not really a whole. More of a collection of songs really. Lionheart is different, as all the songs on the album have a same kind of mood. A hard to describe, fairytale-ish, seventies mood.<br />I always have different favorites than other people (many name Wow and Oh England My Lionheart); mine are Fullhouse and Kashka From Baghdad. They both have amazing melodies, and are songs that are amongst my all-time favorites.<br />Though this album doesn't show a giant step ahead from the previous album,(which was the case with the rest of her work), it is definately something worth to buy. My favorite Kate Bush album is The Dreaming, with Never For Ever as a really close runner-up, so Lionheart has to be number 3. Not bad for an album that's been rushed.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|A friend of mine lent me this CD not long ago, and knowing nothing of Iron Maiden except that they were a metal band, I was very pleased and surprised to hear how great this band really is (or at least this album).  If you're a fan of heavy metal, don't pass this up.  The best songs: &quot;Blood Brothers,&quot; and of course the brilliant &quot;The Nomad.&quot;
B000006U44|3.0|I really don't listen to this 1st one as much as number 2 (Lionheart), 3 (Never For Ever) and 4 (The Dreaming), all of which I totally adore, but there's no doubt about it that the songs on here are good. Still, this record is too much 'girl with the high voice', a result of Wuthering Heights being such a big hit back then. Maybe Kate wanted some songs to be lower keyed, but I think the producer told her to keep it up because that would bring up more money or something. I don't think it's bad though, since I've given it three stars. Why? Just because Moving, Saxophone Song, Strange Phenomena and WH are great songs. The rest is not bad either, a song like Kite cheers me up, but in the second part it does get weaker and the album just poops in a little. Still, it's amazing what she achieved here at the age of only 20 (my age) and I'm glad she took control over production ever since Never For Ever, because concerning that, The Kick Inside isn't really that special.
B00003CXE7|2.0|The most overrated and disappointing movie in years. Cheesy special effects, lurid overracting, ponderous, cliche-filled story. I have rewatched it several times, thinking, &quot;It can't be that bad. I must have missed something. There must be more to it.&quot; Well, it is that bad, I didn't miss anything, and there's nothing mroe to it than that.
B000002UA7|3.0|This one is hard to rate. As for the songs, I'd give it 5 stars, without a doubt. But for the album itself, I don't even wanna rate it. It's clear that it's pretty much an album made for commercial ends, like all Best Of's are, now that I think of it. Kind of silly to put Experiment IV on this album; die-hard Kate fans having to spend their money on tracks they already have except for that one. Probably this was all record-company ordered. <br />Still, if there are people who are in need of 'introduction' to Kate Bush (hard to imagine since pretty much all of her albums are low-priced, so why not just buy all of them?) this one's OK, although my real favorites (Blow Away, There Goes A Tenner, Houdini, Leave It Open, Fullhouse, Infant Kiss, to name a few) aren't on here, with a few exceptions (Army Dreamers, Sat In Your Lap). Then again, it is ofcourse a single compilation and Kate's most brilliant songs weren't released as singles, as it wouldn't be well-received by most people who have mediocre taste in music, and only understand the instant catchy stuff.<br />I have to join the rest concerning Wuthering Heights with the new vocals; totally ridiculous. The original is perfect as it is and doesn't need 'improvement' like this; Kate's voice sounds kinda weird too on here. Kind of sad thing that comes on top of this; The Whole Story is the beginning of Kate's end. The Sensual World and Red Shoes aren't really worth listening to, in my opinion, with exception of a few songs. People who need introduction to Kate can be glad there's no song from those 2 albums included here.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I  couldn't watch this movie, and I couldn't not watch. I kept having to get up and step outside, but I couldn't turn away from it. <BR>Roberto Benigni's story of a madcap romantic who sacrifices everything to save the life and innocence of his son in the face of the most monsterous evil the world has ever seen is wildly, inventively funny and heartbreaking, both at the some time. <BR>This is one of the best movies of the last 20 or 30 years, and easily the best movie of the 1990s. I may never have the courage to watch it again, but I will never forget it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is probably my favorite film of last year.  Having seen it a whole bunch of times now, some of its excesses do seem a bit silly.  It's not a perfect film - but a damn good one.  If more films follow this example, the movie-musical can make a come back.<br />This DVD is about as good as we could've hoped.  BE WARNED - there are a lot of cookies hidden on the menus.   If you go to the \\"deleted scenes\\" menu, go left.  A Windmill will appear and take you to a nice outtake from the \\"Your Song\\" bit where Nicole and Ewen completely lose it.  As for the rest, you'll have to find them yourself.
B000002LK1|5.0|\\"Enjoy The Silence\\" IS without compare THE best Depeche Mode song ever recorded by this fascinating band.  It's a personal all around favorite song of mine of ANY band as well.  The way it moves, the melody, the chord pattern, it's truly a magnificent piece of music.<br /><br />Although just that tune alone would bring the CD to 5 stars, there's plenty of other great tunes here.  \\"Policy Of Truth\\" also gives you that noir tinged musical feel.  I liken DM to a musical thunderstorm.  Listening is like watching the sky blacken and lightening and thunder approaching.  I hope that makes sense to someone other than me.  \\"Personal Jesus\\" is another dark  classic for devout fans of DM.<br /><br />The \\"Violator\\" CD is perhaps the most commercially viable and well known CD of this band.  Therefore, if you like Depeche Mode,  adding \\"Violator\\" to YOUR CD collection would be the \\"Sweetest Perfection\\" of all.
B000000WHH|5.0|i'll preface this with the fact that boy george is my strength figure-i have much love for this album-- yes it is 80's pop but oh so soulful!- the female vocalist who accompanied the boys here has such a powerful voice- perhaps felt most on one of my favorite songs (ever) &quot;that's the way&quot; -- it has the classic &quot;karma chameleon&quot; but don't stop there--they surely don't-- the whole work is solid!
B000000WZ4|4.0|What an opener \\"Barrel Of A Gun\\" makes for this intriguing CD.  I wish the song came to it's hook quicker and stayed with it for several more minutes though!  Just as I'm really getting into it, it fades away.<br /><br />Depeche Mode has always made interesting and introspective music,  and \\"Ultra\\" does not come up short.  \\"Useless\\" is a favorite, as well as \\"It's No Good.\\"<br /><br />Of all the cuts, I will re-iterate that \\"Barrel Of A Gun\\" ranks up there with \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\" and the best song DM ever recorded \\"Enjoy The Silence.\\"  I love the dark sinister feel of the chord pattern and the eerie instrumentation.  If you're going to sing about staring at the barrel of a gun, you need appropriate accompanying music, and this is IT!<br /><br />If you are a Depeche Mode fan, add \\"Ultra\\" to your collection.  You won't be disappointed.

B00005R87Q|1.0|I was hoping for a mindless car movie.  It's certainly mindless, but it's not even about cars.  There's more fighting and shooting than racing.  (And it's not a very good fighting and shooting movie.)  What driving is shown is less realistic than a Bond film.  It looks like they did the Benny Hill trick of speeding up the film.  Then after a minute of driving, they get out and talk about cars -- and the dialog must have been written by someone who has never owned a car or read a single word about racing.  If you like cars, you'll hate this movie, and if you're not into cars, the ads have probably already convinced you not to buy it.<BR>If you want a car movie, I recommend Bullitt.  Thirty years later, it's still king.
078388334X|5.0|&quot;Into the Wild&quot; is not so much a book about the wilderness, as it is a book about what happens to mentally ill people. Chris McCandless was a very, very sick man. This was the feeling I had when I first read the article in Outside magazine nearly ten years ago, when I was in the midst of my own psychological turmoil.  Now that I can read it with the perspective of a man who has finally settled into the bliss of domesticity and mental health, I see it as one of the 20th century's primary documents about the heartwrenching devastation of mental illness.  For that, the book is worth a resounding five stars.

B00000IPAX|5.0|A great cd from start to finish.  Unlike many albums which have a few good songs but are lead by one or two hits, this album starts strong and stays that way.

0425173895|5.0|I've read several reviews that say something like, &quot;Not the best Agatha.&quot;  I would strongly disagree.  Of the 80 or so novels writen by Christie, I've probably read about half of them.  Not surprisingly, the books that get the most hype were on my list:  Murder on the Orient Express, ABC Murders, And Then There Were None, etc. etc.  Of the Christie &quot;classics&quot;, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is the best.  This novel has all the attributes of a great mystery:  suspense, vibrant characters, Hercule Poirot, unpredictability, and a jaw dropping ending.
B00001MXXG|5.0|This movie came out right around the beginning of my senior year of high school.  It was then, and still is, one of the FUNNIEST movies I have ever seen!  Matthew Broderick plays the title role of Ferris Bueller, a high-school kid who decides that he just can't make it through his last semester of his senior year without taking one last day off (This is my ninth sick day this semester.  If I go for ten, I'm probably gonna have to barf up a lung, so I better make this one count!).  Alan Ruck plays Ferris' best friend, Cameron Frye (Why can't you let me rot in peace?), who is ACTUALLY sick that day and home alone in bed.  Mia Sara plays Ferris' girlfriend, Sloane Peterson, who also is in the mood to take a day off.  Jeffrey Jones is Ed Rooney, the school principal who sees through Ferris' scheme right away and decides that this time, he's gonna catch Ferris in the act and &quot;put one heck of a dent in his future&quot;.  Jennifer Grey is Jeannie Bueller, Ferris's sister who also knows that Ferris is skipping and wants to catch him to show her parents that Ferris is not the perfect child they think he is.  The supporting cast is wonderful, especially Edie McClurg as Ed Rooney's airheaded secretary, and Charile Sheen as a drugged-out punk with a remarkable way of getting to the heart of problems.<br />As the movie begins, we realize pretty quickly that this is NOT just Ferris waking up one morning and deciding to skip, but rather a well-planned conspiracy between Ferris and Sloane to skip school, cover their tracks, grab Cameron (willing or not), and spend a day with Cameron's dad's Ferrari tooling around downtown Chicago.  Ferris' task is made much easier by the fact that his parents believe that he is the most perfect child ever who can do no wrong.  Ferris comments when his parents swallow his lie about being sick and then head off to work, &quot;One of the worst performances of my career, and they never doubted it for a second.&quot;  Clearly, Ferris has trained them well.  The plan unfolds - Ferris drages Cameron out of bed, they pick up the Ferrari, pull Sloane out of school with the old &quot;dead grandmother&quot; routine, and then its off for a day on the town.  Unbeknownst to them, Rooney and Jeannie both are on to them, and have independently decided to ttrack them down and bring them to justice.  Neither of them, of course, is any match for Ferris' ingenuity.<br />As the movie unfolds, it becomes clear that Ferris is doing more than just skipping.  Ferris and Cameron are about to start two different colleges in the fall, and Sloane still has another year of high school.  Ferris' life is about to change, and he's scared.  He's also trying to get Cameron loosened up a bit before he heads off to college, and Cameron needs it.  Cameron has his own problems to resolve.  <br />This movie is not just about high school, its about teenage life in general.  Hughes nails life during the teen years very well here, as he also did in several other films during the '80s.<br />Although some of the subject matter is fairly weighty, Hughes still manages to come up with a script LOADED with hilarity.  Some of my favorite bits include:<br />(1)  Ferris playing the Blue Danube on his keyboard (trust me).<br />(2)  Ferris infiltrating the German-American day parade in downtown Chicago to comandeer the float and sing a great rendition of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; by the Beatles (with his dad dancing along, clueless as usual, in his office high above).<br />(3)  Rooney's first attempt to capture Ferris in a video arcade.  In all of Chicago, did Rooney really think he had a chance of finding Ferris by just looking around at random?<br />(4)  Lunch.  (&quot;Four thousand restraunts in the downtown area.  I pick the one my father goes to.&quot;)<br />(5)  The frantic race to get home before Jeannie and his parents find out he's not really sick in bed.<br />(6)  The myriad places where the phrase &quot;Save Ferris&quot; is up all over Chicago,including a water tower and the marquee at Wrigley Field.  <br />(7)  Ben Stein as the world's most boring teacher, and his student's pathetic attempts to pay attention and stay awake.<br />(8)  The closing credits.  Definitely don't turn off this film until there is nothing but a black screen.<br />There are many, MANY more great bits in this film.  It's not really all that dated, either, other than the cars and clothes and such.  It's a movie that high-schoolers related to in 1986, but I bet high-schoolers today could relate to it just as much.  It really is a timeless film about coming of age.  Every teenager needs to see it.
B00005QZWJ|4.0|While not on the level of a Titanic soundtrack or the best of John Williams, Howard Shore creates a richly textured background to the epic Lord of the Rings. Along with 2 Enya pieces, this soundtrack conveys a sense of a time long gone with celtic references from our own history. Well worth listening to.
6305537798|5.0|This movie was expected to ether be a Shakespearean stiff or a teen flick with no point. Although it had the makings of a teen flick it was indeed much different. Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger brought their parts to life &amp; embodied their characters. The movie was altogether riveting with a few minor exceptions. I myself thought that this movie was a great making of taming the shrew but in a different genre than regular Shakespeare movie. I recommend this movie to everyone under the age of 32 and above the age of 14.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When the movie began, the frenetic pace and bizzare atmosphere was a shock to the senses, but when the love story came into full flower, this movie transformed into a tragic, yet beautiful piece of art. Ewan McGregor and Nichole Kidman put their all into this movie. The power they lack in their voices is made up for in the power of the emotions they portray. Absolutely stunning!

B00005QZ7U|2.0|Hear me out first--I would rather give this movie 2 and 1/2 stars instead of 2, but sadly I didn't think it was worth 3...<br />I started out believing I would love this movie--it would become maybe my favorite movie of all time! When I saw the previews, the<BR>ads, all of it looked promising...I respect movies like these--<BR>they are original and creative and bright. I suppose I spoke too soon.<br />Many, many people walked out of this movie--left disappointed like I wanted to. The minute I saw this movie it let me down.<BR>Just the movement of the camera work--the movie of the movie--<BR>the way it went--it made you feel like your head was in a blender. (I believe I wrote that somewhere else.) Not only that--<BR>a blender with every color of the universe in it to make you even more confused and at times disgusted and thinking to yourself you'd rather actually be IN a blender than watching this movie. Ewan's and Nicole's vocal talents can be impressive<BR>at times but not even that can save this &quot;film?&quot;<br />&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; was TOO unique. I tend to believe Baz saw this as an opportunity to make a movie out of the ordinary. It came out being two movies. &quot;Unique&quot; doesn't always mean &quot;good&quot;.<br />At first the music never ceases or slows in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. There<BR>is a constant flow of it--from a swirling display of can-can dancers twirling to Fat Boy Slim to a sudden jerk of Ewan McGregor screaming out &quot;The Sound of Music Lyrics&quot; to another sudden jerk (of it I mean the camera) to Kidman in diamonds onto of a swing--then to the Duke with an excessive half hour of bopping and hopping and jumping here and there (in an overly ornate elephant?) with tunes from Elton John to Madonna to--ERR--<BR>just about everything and not once do they calm down--lighten up--or let us catch our breathes. Sometimes I ask myself-and I find myself doing it particually with this movie-doesn't the director every see their terribleflaws? <br />Then we get into it. The &quot;Love Story&quot; that is. Boy meets girl-<BR>girl is a singing prositute threathened by an evil duke to be taken away from boy-boy is so madly in love that something with the strength and vigor of &quot;El Tango De Roxanne&quot; plays through the speakers. The end is so predicable and the story proves to be so UN-original. They tried to create a such a deepness and concentration on this silly plot line at times stupid story that it comes out laugable. I think what a waste on film and sets and costumes and actors! <br />&quot;Rouge&quot; could have been infinitely better--they could have kept the same music somewhat (perhaps somemore origial songs to straighten it out) and sets and costumes ect. It is really wonderful when films set in the 19th century or such use modern pop songs with a twist and beat to bring a sense of fantasy to it. It is brillant when the sets and costumes reflect this-when they show that none of this is possibly-when it all appears like it's a dream. <br />Please don't think I am saying that the music is awful-in fact I was dying for the soundtrack afterwards except for pieces like the remake of Madonna's &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; just did not handle the music right. They cramed it all together at one point. Then they never stopped. At times it went to fast. At times it went to slow. They used the music inproperly. It might have been one of the best shows ever if they balanced it out. <BR>First they could have had an up-beat music fest in the beginning<BR>(with a few moments of peace in between for us relax and grasp what is going on)-then slowed it down, build with mellow tunes to a the end and alas bring in the weight of the songs like<BR>&quot;Hindu Sad Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Roxanne&quot;. And why not play the whole song for once instead of skipping around to piece after piece?<br />&quot;Roxanne&quot; is such an overpowering and beautiful piece (whether it be from Sting or not) that it should have been saved--saved for something with more of a story line. The singers sound like  they are overwhelmed with the growth of the Nazi power instead of--what was it again?--love?--the distructing of the night club?--still not big enough. (This is why I think the whole gist of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; would have worked so much preferable with something like &quot;Cabaret&quot;).<br />The reason this movie is like two short films instead of one is it's immedate cut to what seems like an SNL skit to the battlefields of WW2. I would not like to be inside Baz's head when he was thinking of bringing this movie to life. Well, he<BR>got noticed, I'll give him that. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; should not have been called &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. It was barely about the club. This happens with many movies (Pearl Harbor, Titanic) than intertwine a love story that at all does not connect to reflect the main purpose for evening making the film! <br />It may sound like I am gravely disappointed. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; did fall flat on it's own windmill. I gave this movie 2 stars for the fact that I liked the general idea of what thet where trying to create--but they didn't succeed. I really cannot comprehend why people LOVE this movie with 5 stars. Can't they see it's flaws? How can they understand it? Yet some people that gave it 1 stars seem to do this for the simple fact that they have no imagination and think the people that made this movie actually though France was like that at the time.<br />Whether you gave it 5 stars or 1 I really don't think you're a<BR>psychoneurotic deranged oaf--if that's what you like so be it.<BR>Young or old people seem to either hate or love this film. I'll<BR>look at it as maybe a step to further improving musicals into masterpieces--something &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; failed to be.
B00003CWNR|1.0|...it NEVER could have been made, and it CERTAINLY never could have won an academy award.  Those are the facts.  Hollywood is swimming with liberal politics, it's no secret, and if you think they're above promoting a political agenda you are fooling yourselves.
B00005Q2RZ|4.0|Talk about being in the right place at the right time.  Ryan Adams managed to pull together an album immersed in &quot;Americana&quot;, with a flag on the cover and a little tune called &quot;New York, New York&quot;.  And, no, that isn't a cover of Sinatra's classic song of the same name.  Although the same magical feeling is there.<br />One has to wonder how much unintended publicity Gold has recieved after the attacks in New York.  This reviewer (and probably many others) first came to know of Ryan Adams by seeing his video (with his grungy hair) against a backdrop of the old NYC skyline.  What was this?  Some artist cashing in on the tragedy already?  But without knowing the story behind Gold, I listened to the song and found it strangely cathartic.<br />Now, many months later, Gold still holds up as a solid effort.  &quot;Firecracker&quot; is one of the few upbeat tracks on the album, after which the songs take on a somber or reflective note.  The first half of the disc is the strongest, with &quot;La Cienega Just Smiled&quot;, &quot;The Rescue Blues&quot;, and &quot;Somehow, Someday&quot; being the most memorable tracks.<br />The later half manages some noteworthy tunes, including &quot;Sylvia Plath&quot; and &quot;Wild Flowers&quot;.  Adams parts the album aptly with the gentle-yet-mocking &quot;Goodnight Hollywood Blvd&quot;.<br />If they call this &quot;alt-country&quot;, then consider me a new fan of the genre.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Great special effects but this is no &quot;Midway&quot;. History buffs need not buy this disc. Save your money and rent this just for the special features.<br />One of the reasons DVD's are so popular is that you can put an entire movie on one disc...Then why did the makers of this movie decide to make the consumer get up to change discs to see the conclusion of the film? Unacceptable. Wait until they put out a 1 disc version!
B00004U2G4|5.0|Led Who?  If you ever wondered why Beck is considered a guitar great, then just listen to this incredible record.  The attack and fuel which JB exerts on some of the cuts on this work have yet to be surpassed.  Rod Stewart shows that he is one of Rock's greatest vocalists, and the interplay between he and Beck is stunning.  Rock My Plimsoul, basically an amped up revision of the Broonzy blues classic Rock Me Baby, is played as tightly, nasty, and nonsense free, as anybody could possibly play a song.  Any young, aspiring guitarist should buy, listen, and try<BR>to emulate the sounds which Jeff exhibits on this wonderful<BR>set.  This record is not about flash or trickery, but rather focuses on just playing some great bluesy and ballsy Rock and Roll.  Beck's fusion jazz albums are ok, however, they lack real substance.  This recording is virtually composed of nothing but substance.  If you can handle the truth, then buy it.  If you can't, then keep buying the ... that passes for music today.  This is one of those masterpieces that is not only a great listen, but also serves as a great educational tool as well.<BR>Listen and learn.  Zeppelin was sitting in the wings waiting and watching, and look how well they did by imitating what Jeff and his group originated.  One of the most influential albums of all time!  Essential, relevant, and very enjoyable.  By the way, get the Jeff Beck Group's second album Beck Ola as well.  It is almost as good, and unfortunately the outfit destroyed itself soon after its release.  If you own Truth and Beck Ola, then you have virtually most of Jeff Beck's seminal, relevant, and truly essential material.  If he wasn't his own worst enemy, then you truly wonder just what he could have accomplished if he only stayed a bit more focused and exhibited just a little more self restraint, with regard to his musical career.  Oh well, at least he made this record, and it alone is a greater achievement than the best work of all but a select handful of musical artists.  It's that good!
B000002IWQ|5.0|This is one of my fav. albums by them. I have listened to this cd many times since it came out. It never gets stale and Pearts drumming is excellent on this cd. Let's hope their upcoming cd is just as fresh and exciting.....
B000002PH1|5.0|'Heaven On Earth' Belinda Carlisle's 2nd solo outing, is equally as strong as her 1st, 'Belinda', although this one is more of a departure from her well-known Go-Go's sound. Although almost 15 years old, the title track is still as strong as ever, with angelic vocals underlining the 'Heavenly' title. Like other reviewers here, I feel BC's version of 'I Feel Free' is far better than Cream's original (of course the fact that I hate Eric Clapton might affect my decision). Other standout tracks on this album are the singles, 'I Get Weak' and 'Circle In The Sand'. I might also add that I never thought that I'd like a Diane Warren song until I heard the utterly charming 'World Without You' from this album. If you like Belinda, The Go-Go's or timeless pop in general, Get It Now!
B000051VWW|5.0|Sades music is amazing (and specially lovers rock) because everybody could like these songs. Teenagers in love, old men or women, playful gays... I dont know everybody fall in love with these tender songs. My favorite songs are &quot;By your side&quot;, &quot;King of sorrow&quot;, &quot;Every word&quot; and &quot;Lovers rock&quot;. <BR>Everybody who like pop music should have this cd.
0066620996|5.0|Collins continues his quest [begun with Built To Last]for detailing the special circumstances and conditions for businesses, and non-profit organizations presumably, who have achieved that special status of corporate identity ... Great.  He makes his case with well researched data and documentation and leaves little to question.<br />Executives at various organizational levels need to examine this new book carefully.  It tells, once again, the essential patterns of executive behavior which have allowed certain businesses to &quot;succeed&quot; beyond its competition; an important measurement for any manager worth his/her salt.  A new &quot;must read&quot; for organization managers in 2002.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This CD is very very good. I recommend it to anyone who likes staind, creed, Our Lady Peace, or any other good music. This is not a cd based just on How You Remind Me, it Has Many Other Good Songs, Such as My personal favorite, Too Bad. Hangnail and Never again are also quite good, and all the songs are at least Decent.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I am extremely shocked! I felt the need to bash all these negative reviews in here from their existence. Moulin Rouge! is definitely one of the best movies of 2001. Ewan and Nicole blew me away with their performances in this movie. Everything was perfect in this movie. The songs were one of the best I've heard all around. I am so happy that this movie got 6 GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATIONS. Without a doubt it is definitely going to win BEST PICTURE and BEST ACTRESS. Nicole Kidman shines in this movie. I strongly recommend this movie. Don't hesitate. BUY IT NOW! [...]
0671027344|5.0|i dont think i can explain how wonderful this book is.  ive read parts of it outloud in my highschool english classes.  i give this book to my best friends, and because they know just how much it means to me they recognize that they mean that much to me.  i read this book for the first time during one of the worst parts of my life so far, and it basically shocked me into realizing &quot;hey some people have it worse! wake up woman!&quot; since then, ive read that book until it has almost fallen apart.  some of my teachers have read my copy and each time someone knew reads it, i ask them to use a different colored pen and outline their favorite parts as they read.  i cant stress how amazing Chbosky is and i am still waiting for another book.  this is one of the best gifts someone could give... if youre looking for a present for your boyfriend or girlfriend just a friend or your child, this is it. nothing compares...
0792151712|4.0|I suppose every person who has ever seen this movie has their own opinion, and their own view of what is good and what is bad about the film,which I suppose that it was these reviews are all about. I enjoyed it mostly from the standpoint of the special effects such as the bridge and engine room scenes (before, during and after the collision with the iceberg.) Some people don't like the music, but I do: in particular the &quot;Southampton&quot; and &quot;Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch&quot; sequences . To really appreciate this film, I think you need to have a copy of &quot;A Night To Remember&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; (1953). I first saw the 1953 version while in the Navy during the Korean Conflict......the film was alright, but not all that outstanding....its only redeeming factor being that  am a fan of Clifton Webb. I would rate the three films in the order listed below. Another interesting sidelight to appreciation of the films is the CD-ROM Game &quot;Titanic-Adventure Out Of Time&quot;. I finally muddled through the game and got off safely, having everything with me on th lifeboat to prevent the Russian Revolution, World War I and World War II, et cetera, et cetera and so forth. However, I find the &quot;Tour&quot; option the most interesting. You can watch the <BR>film(s) and then take your own personal cruise on RMS Titanic at your leisure.(You won't need to worry about the iceberg on the &quot;Tour&quot;.)<BR>                        My Ratings:<BR>(1) &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997) - tie with &quot;Titanic-Adventure Out Of Time&quot;<BR>(2) &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; <BR>(3) &quot;Titanic&quot; (1953)-and a distant third if it wasn't for Clifton Webb
B00005OCMR|4.0|TRON will always be remembered for its historical significance--the first movie to employ major computer-generated effects--than it ever will for its script or story, both of which don't hold up incredibly to repeated viewings.  Luckily, this 2-Disc set recgnizes the historical place of this elecTRONic milestone, including a lot of arcival and documentary footage.  The transfer of the film isn't the greatest--I've seen better restorations of older material--but I didn't experience the compression another reviewer was complaining about--my film looked fine, with widescreen bars top and bottom.<br />The film itself feels dated (as does any movie from the 80's prominently featuring a video arcade!), and in the future I'll probably watch it in the same way I'd watch something like Whitman's &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;--as a historical artifact.  But scenes like the light-cycle game are still cool ;), and it's still worth putting on the DVD shelf.
1577311523|5.0|I approached this book with skepticism, as I do most in the category of new age teachers. After reading his writings and hearing him in person, I'm almost convinced he's the real thing. There is a most definite, profound wisdom in his message.  And his story is so compelling --to be suicidal and then having an awakening. An example of grace? He does't explain. Can you talk yourself into a clear mind or do you have to be at the end of your rope?  And how much good do books do? Some one tell me...
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is one of the most uplifting movies I have ever seen. You must sit down with your kids and experience together how the love of family can triumph over the worst imaginable experiences life can throw at anyone. It puts fatherhood into a whole new light and loyalty exactly where it belongs.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin rouge has to be my favorite movie ever. Nicole kidman is amzing! She actually sings all the songs in the movie, and her voice is amazing! Her costar also has an amazing voice. I though this movie was going to be totally teenny bopper, like chic flick but omg I was crying when the movie ended. The movie makes you wish you were there, makes you wish you could be them. I dunno, you just gotta give Moulin Rouge the movie and the soundtrack. Come what May, is breathtaking. I can't tell you how many people I know have said, I am surprised its as good as it is. Omg I could go on and on about this movie, but basicly I love it.
B000002MTR|4.0|&quot;One Hot Minute&quot; is almost a great album, there are a few excellent tracks, but the album overall didn't click for me the way that &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; or &quot;Californication&quot; did. One of the reasons this album doesn't rank as high as it should is because of guitarist Dave Navarro, he is an excellent guitarist to be sure, but his style of music and the peppers style are different and it shows, his guitar work shines on a few tracks, &quot;Warped&quot;, &quot;Coffee Shop&quot;, but that's about it. My favorite tracks are &quot;Warped&quot;, &quot;Aeroplane&quot;, &quot;My Friends&quot;, &quot;Coffee Shop&quot;. I also like Flea's bass solo and his singing on &quot;Pea&quot;. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are my favorite band and I do like this album but it lacks the energy found in other Chili Peppers albums, but on it's own it's defintly worth a listen.
0553577123|5.0|Anne Frank's book is a classic and an inspiration, and no revisionist such as Faurisson can change that.  Anything he reports about the book of Anne Frank has about as much validity as his reports that the Nazis had no gas chambers.<br />Robert Faurisson of France downplays every aspect of Nazi Germanys involvement in the Holocaust, and when the facts and documentation refute his statements, he produces information that will back his stance - information that is fabricated by Faurisson.<br />He asserts, for example that the German Army had received orders to avoid participating in actions that civilians took against Jews.  Quite simply, his statements denies any active involvement by Nazi's, including the statements that there were no gas chambers.  That any action against the Jews was beyond the control or influence of the Nazi Party, and the claims of the Jews are invalid.<br />For making statements like these, Faurisson was dismissed from his academic post in France. Faurisson, his publishers, and supporters who have distributed or promoted his pro-Nazi materials have been tried, convicted, fined, and barred from holding any government jobs.  (Le Monde, 19 September 1983).
B00005QDW1|5.0|What's with all these 1 and 2 star reviews ? This is a really good album, No Doubt has tried something new and the result is possibly their best effort to date. This album has a strong pop/ raggae feel to it, I found myself enjoying most of the album's 13 tracks. The standout songs are: &quot;Hella Good&quot;, (which I hope is the next single released off the album it is the best song on the album), &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;Underneath it all&quot;, &quot;Making Out&quot;, &quot;Detective&quot;, &quot;Waiting Room&quot; and &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. This album doesn't have the new wave feel of &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; or the ska/pop feel of &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; which is why I think a lot of people are giving this album sub par reviews. Bands do change if the fans can't accept it, tough luck. One of the best of 2001, and quite possibly No Doubt's best album to date.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I must admit that this soundtrack pleasantly surprised me.  When I heard that Shore was picked to bring Middle Earth to us musically, I was puzzled.  Having listened to this CD, and having listened to it matched with the magic of the big screen, I believe Shore has created something...well....magical.  <br />The score completely matches the moods of Middle Earth and especially the adventures of the fellowship, the settings, and the dangers.  When Gandalf reads what is written on the ring to Frodo, the music made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  The music captured the feeling perfectly.<br />The best surprise of the soundtrack is that the lyrics are written in the two elvish languages, Sindarin and Quenyan, in black speech, and in dwarvish.  Somebody put a lot of work into this project to bring out the details of Middle Earth, even if the majority of the audiences will never notice.  <br />The best pieces on the album are \\"Lothlorien,\\" which contains a mournful \\"Lament for Gandalf,\\" sang by an emotionally distraught elf, \\"Concerning Hobbits,\\" and \\"The Council of Elrond,\\" which contains Enya's \\"Aniron\\" (Theme for Aragorn and Arwen).  <br />This is an excellent soundtrack.
B00005JKQX|5.0|When a friend called to see if I wanted to go to A Beautiful Mind I was doubtful.  I thought it would be depressing.  But I went, and we both loved it.  It's not depressing; it's funny, mysterious, and uplifting.  It's the kind of movie you want to discuss after you've seen it.  I highly recommend it.
B000002N2Z|5.0|This Is One Great CD! Chino's words jump out of the speakers and slam you in the face, and everything else just rocks! <BR>Song descriptions:<br />Bored: Despite what all reviewers say, it's nothing special. Cool guitar, but that's it.<br />Minus Blindfold: While the position of my favorite song on this CD, formerly occupied by this song, has been taken over by One Weak, this song is still around 4th place (which doesn't even do it justice), and is great. Chino's vocals are near to his best here.<br />One Weak: The best on this cd. When they sing the chorous the 2nd time, it's like, well, the best vocals on this CD. Everything compliments everything. Perfect.<br />Skipping to... 7 Words (cause I can't remember the songs before it): Up until that whispery &quot;squeal like a pig&quot; part, where it geats really heavy-metal, it reminds me almost of Incubus' Fungus Amongus (in other words, not too good). But the heavy part is great.<br />Birthmark: A really heartfeltfully-sung song. Quite beautiful.<br />Engine No.9: Cool. A great rap-metal song, that you could almost dance to.<br />Fireal: Kinda creepy, but still really good. The put a lot of work into this one.<br />Bonus Track: Really cool, with little singing, but nice guitar.<br />     So, this is a great CD, and, (though just barely), is better than White Pony, (or at least heavier), although WP probably has more thoughtful lyrics, and Knife Prty, (which is how it's really spelled), Change, Mini-maggit (on the enhanced version), and Pink Maggit beat the pants off some songs on Adrenaline (not to say that those songs are bad; every song's good on Adrenaline). Go out, get this CD, and be prepared for the heavy-metal\alt-rock experience of your life!!!!!
B000002I25|5.0|Every song is a classic. This is one of the most significant and influential recordings in rock history.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|Golden Globes? Oscar nominations? Are we speaking of the same movie? This movie was bad. The \\"love story\\" was horrible. Was the director attempting a satire of the stereotypical movie romance? Was he playing it straight? It was impossible to tell. It was best when it was at its most ridiculous because it seemed to be cleaverly making fun of itself, but most of the time the movie pushed you to take it as a serious emotional love story. I give it 3 stars for originality though. I admire the nerve of any movie that trys to break the Hollywood mold, even if it is unsuccessful.
B00000JR29|5.0|The reissue doesn't add anything to the original, however if you don't own it, consider buying it. In my opinion, the \\"hits\\" not even as good as the other songs. \\"The Working Hour\\" is an exquisite piece of music, full of passion. The silky sax intro leads into a huge soundscape, topped by gripping and emotional vocals. It is still chilling when I hear it today. The REST of this recording is great. Other cuts of interest are \\"Listen\\" which crosses many genres, and is a more of a hypnotic chant than synth-pop tune. Certainly one of the finest recordings of the 1980s.
B00004W221|5.0|This movie is perhaps one of the best, well done movies I have ever seen.  Trust me, I've seen hundreds.  Usually that alone would not make me write an on-line review, but when my mom (who only speaks so-so english) starts crying when Rudy finally gets to play with the Fighting Irish, I knew there was something special about this movie.  This is not your typical &quot;Oh no, it's one of those stupid Guy's Only Sports Movie.&quot;  No, it is much more than it seems.  Simply put, you will enjoy this movie because:<br />A)  Well acted<BR>B)  Well written<BR>C)  Well directed<br />That this movie is based on a true story makes it that much better.  &quot;Rudy&quot; is what all movies want to be, good story telling.

0425173755|4.0|Very enjoyable, totally impossible whodunnit with a rather unlikely ending.  But that does not matter.  Hercule Poirot gets stuck on a train ride and then uses his exceptional cunning to find out just who did murder the man in the next room.<br />The story is too far fetched, the reasoning so utterly incisive as to be unbelievable and yet its great because you turn the pages to find out what Poirot's thinking and not whether you were right.<br />Great stuff, totally silly.
0060278234|5.0|I loved this book, and now can;t decide which I liked best, Lireal or Sabriel. Lireal, as said in the title, is a Daughter of the Clayr, but is the only one without the magical gift of the Sight. The other main character in this book is Prince Sameth, son of Sabriel and Touchstone. <br />This book picks up roughly fourteen or fifteen years after Sabriel ended. (BTW, you should definitely read Sabriel first. Without it, the surprises revealed in this book aren't half so..surprising!) I found Part One to be the most intresting, Lireal's adventures in the Clayr's Glacier kept me reading non-stop! The books action slowed down a bit, however, when it came to the parts dealing with Prince Sameth. Sam's story was intresting, but compared to the brilliance of Lireal's story, I was left reading quickly through Sam's chapters to find out what happened next to Lireal.<br />This book leaves many loose ends, which I don't mind-at least it means there's a 3rd book coming! I guessed the surprise about Lireal's birth( I won't write what it is so as not to spoil it) as soon as she found the pipes and it was revealed Sam didn't want to be the Abhorsen-it was obvious! I was then waiting through the rest of the book for Lireal to find out and was satisfied when she finally did at the end.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who even enjoys fantasy sometimes. Along with Sabriel, it is one of the best fantasy books I've read.
B00005OCMR|5.0|&quot;Without Tron there would never be a Toy story&quot;  These are the words of John Lasseter, director of Toy Story.  Lasseter was an up and coming animator for Disney at the same Steven Lisberger was giving birth to the medium of which Toy Story could succeed in.  This quote is one of the many excellent notions suggested throughout the 86 minute &quot;Making of Tron&quot; that appears on the sets second disc.  Obviously the 20th anniversary edition shines with an excellent supplement disc that features the making of documentary, as well as deleted scenes, amazing storyboard renderings, music, and much more.  It is impossible not to fall in love with this movie.  The longer it is around the more you are able to truly realize how many of the concepts are so ahead of its time.  This movie is like a fine wine, it gets better with age.  The further away we get, the more awed we are by its very spot on portrayal of the inner workings of a computer.  The plot deals heavily with religion, and can almost be likened to Christianity.  Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges)is almost the &quot;Jesus&quot; of the &quot;system.&quot;  He is not a God in the flesh, but rather a user in the digits.  His sacrifice at the end of the movie ultimately allows the programs to truly communicate with their creators.  Theres an old saying that suggests that, with enough movie magic you can believe any plot line.  Lisberger provides the most magical cinematic experience of the eighties that even this plot is easy to believe, and love.  If you love computers, video games, and movies, it is a sin for you to not own this DVD.  <br />END OF LINE....
B00005QEO2|5.0|... As I own all of the other Aerosmith CD's on Geffen (except their previous best-of \\"Big Ones\\"), I wouldn't pay much more than that for this. The only real advantage is the 11 total tracks on here that I did not already own, most of which are alternate takes, soundtrack cuts, and \\"B\\" sides (and they are \\"B\\" sides for a REASON). Also, all tracks are digitally remastered, and since I own non-remastered versions of \\"Pump\\", \\"Get A Grip\\", etc., this is a plus for me as well. <br />As greatest hits CD's go though, this is maybe the most complete one I've ever seen, and it's not like \\"Big Ones\\" was overly lacking either. It compiles all of their Geffen-era singles and throws in key album tracks like \\"Hangman Jury\\", \\"Young Lust\\", and \\"Shut Up And Dance\\". It's also refreshing to see a few tracks from the much-maligned \\"Done With Mirrors\\" here, including the excellent \\"Let The Music Do The Talking\\". It also throws in four songs from their live \\"A Little South of Sanity\\" album, purely for the purpose of including live versions of four well-known Aerosmith songs for which Geffen does not own the rights to the original recordings (\\"Dream On\\", \\"Sweet Emotion\\", \\"Hole In My Soul\\", \\"Falling In Love\\"). <br />Regarding the otherwise-hard-to-find-stuff, you get a by-the-numbers remake of the Door's \\"Love Me Two Times\\", a somewhat interesting acoustic version of \\"Living On The Edge\\", an orchestral (re: OVERPRODUCED) version of \\"Amazing\\", the great ballad \\"Deuces Are Wild\\" (from an otherwise lame Beavis & Butt-Head compilation), two decent (but non-essential) tracks from \\"Big Ones\\", and ho-hum interchangable B-sides and import-onlys like \\"Head First\\", \\"Don't Stop\\", 'Can't Stop Messin'\\", and \\"Ain't Enough\\". You also get the version of \\"Walk This Way\\" that Joe Perry & Steven Tyler recorded with Run-D.M.C. Say what you will about that song, but it did accomplish two major milestones for better or worse - it revived Aerosmith's long-dormant career (for better) while simultaneously usheringrap into the mainstream (for worse). <BR> <BR>If you're an Aerosmith completist, you will want this for any songs you don't already have. If you're a casual fan of their 80's and 90's work and don't already own many of their albums from \\"Done With Mirrors\\" onward, you can look at the track listings from this and \\"Big Ones\\" and decide for yourself which suits you better. Either way, this is a great CD.

B00005MP58|5.0|I was going to order the DVD, then saw all the concerns about the video quality.  We own the VHS set, and I was able to obtain both the original and the new Special Edition versions of the DVD from the library.  So, now that we've seen all three....<BR>We found the color quality on the first release DVD to be the same as the VHS tapes.   When we watched the new Special Edition, there are definitely scenes where the colors are overexposed or bleached out looking.  I would say about 30% of the scenes are affected.  I don't think this makes the DVD un-watchable-- you'd probably notice it in some scenes, but it doesn't jump out at you as a huge problem. (I think it is an annoyance, however.)<BR>Bottom line:  I found a copy of the original DVD release to buy. Because we're used to the VHS version, we prefer the richer colors of the old DVD to the widescreen foramt of the new one.  Others may feel the opposite.   I do suggest that you rent or borrow a copy (many libraries have it) before you buy......<br />Oh, and we think the program itself is outstanding!
B000002GVO|4.0|I'll raise my hand and say, yes, I was two years old when &quot;Hotel California&quot; was released.  And given that fact, I'll concede that I don't understand the album's contextual significance the ways other who were there might.  Maybe the perpetual endless overexposure of the songs on this album has colored my perception.<br />But the Eagles, as a band, have always puzzled me.  Some bands have (had?) famous members that reinforce the band's sound and its songwriting, i.e., Pink Floyd and Genesis.  But the Eagles just seemed to dilute themselves - can you imagine Joe Walsh's &quot;Life's Been Good To Me So Far&quot; on an Eagles album?  His sense of humor seems muted, almost lost with the Eagles.  Likewise, the bitterness of Henley's &quot;Boys of Summer&quot; is approached only by &quot;The Last Resort&quot; on this album (although Henley's bitterness has become something of a cliche).<br />Not that the album is bad.  But &quot;Hotel California&quot; seems to have been written by a committee and produced by a focus group - and while we're left with something very good, it's kind of generic and lifeless at the same time.
0446608955|1.0|If the author used the term, &quot;to tell you the truth&quot; one more time...This book was terrible.  The characters were so one dimensional, the plot was vague, and the vocabulary and wording was at the middle school level, at most.  This story probably could have been developed into a decent book had the author (or another author) taken more time with this.  The book sounds as if it was &quot;banged out&quot; in an evening or two; like a rush job that was done to satisfy a contract with the publishers!  Don't read this unless you have not a thing to do, or it is the only book you have with you while stranded on a desert island!

0393317552|2.0|When I bought this book at my daughter's university bookstore, I was full of high expectations based upon enthusiastic reviews I'd heard on NPR. Very quickly, I was disappointed.<br />First, it seems to me that Jared Diamond cannot write very well. This book lacks style, and demonstrates average writing at best. It would [should] earn just a \\"C\\" in any college English course, except Freshman English 101.<br />Second, Diamond's goal seems to have been to present an antithetical approach to history, world social and political development. Fundamentally, he tried to convince his readers that history only occurred as it did, because of serious abuses by those who came out on top. He presents nearly all other societies as intellectual and sociological equals to those that obviously enjoyed much greater success through time.<br />Of course some of what he postulates is valid, but none of it seems new: his scenes change, but old thoughts remain. What is revolutionary about this book is that it offers negative \\"justifications\\" for most western societal successes, contrasted to positive \\"excuses\\" for nearly all non-western societies that didn't attain vibrancy, success, and longevity. It seems that in the author's mind, unsuccessful societies cannot be blamed for their failures; but successful societies should be blamed for their successes.<br />Diamond's book will appeal to young, nihilistic minds, and to others who long to justify the lack of what is generally termed \\"progress\\" (social, intellectual, industrial) by many minority societies around the world. As with many similar flawed presentations, all is not lost. At least this book stimulates the reader to reexamine old conclusions and values, but in the end Diamond's book lacks an intellectual and historical foundation that will stand. Mostly, I think Diamond's work supports pseudo-intellectual ramblings that are driven to elevate the low status of those who have not thrived and succeeded in the modern world. His repeated explanations and justifications for societal \\"failures\\" and their lack of \\"progress\\" amongst competitors, suggests that Diamond has a general antipathy towards the successful societies in our world and a bleeding heart for those that haven't made it.<br />In sum: this book is somewhat interesting; too long; pretty sophomoric; and, not well written. Those who long for a \\"politically correct\\" approach to history, wherein the vanquished become heroes, will love it. I was disappointed and made to wonder how Jared Diamond won a Pulitzer Prize for this effort. Subsequently, I've lost a good bit of respect for the Pulitzer Prize, as it seems that they have come to cherish political correctness more than literary excellence.
B00003CXA2|5.0|For the 50th time I sat down to watch forest Gump a couple of nights ago and I watched Tom Hanks and I thought to myself how good of an actor can a man be to win two Oscars in a row..... You would have to be awesome to do that and that is exactly what Tom Hanks is... <BR>This movie is the only movie I can say that every single person in my family has seen and loved from young to old and I know that all of them own it. And if you don't own this movie I think it is the biggest mistake. Forest Gump is a classic now in my book and it is like Wizard of OZ or where mine sits next to the Godfather collection that I just bought... you know you can't go wrong with Gump, so if you have not bought this movie yet purchase it because it is an essential for all movie Libraries...
B00000BKI4|4.0|I bought this album on a roadtrip up from LA to Portland.  I hadn't read anything about beforehand, but later read how critics were hailing it as the best of '98. <BR>Compared with most of what came out that year, I'd have to agree, it's better than most.  <BR>This record is mellow.  Personally, I find the first six tracks GREAT listening.  You can't top the first two for sure.  Or that's what I thought anyway.  A few months later, the Flaming Lips came out with &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;, and promptly shoved this album to the side.  The Lips' effort eclipsed this one, and it's too bad it did. I started listening to it again recently, and I'm surprised I still liked it as much as I did.  Still, I'm not into ALL the tracks, but the first six are worth it.  <BR>Mercury Rev's new album, &quot;All is Dream&quot; is much the same.  A truly great album.  These guys are good, and it's worth listening to almost anything they do.
B00005JKT8|5.0|Kate and Leopold is a delightful movie about a handsome nineteenth century duke who accidentally slips through a portal in time and finds himself in twenty-first century New York.  The Duke of Albany is masterfully played by Hugh Jackman, who is very successful in contrasting the romance of an earlier time with the crassness of today. Meg Ryan is adept at playing a young career woman who is getting ahead professionally, but who is emotionally jaded.  This movie will be secretly adored by many supposed feminists who long for the shy attentions of a Leopold, and most certainly  ridiculed by men who wish they had half his charm!
B00004XONN|5.0|A lot of you people think that Radiohead sucks because they released an album with little guitar and doesn't sound like Ok Computer.  Well, if you read the Rolling Stone cover article about them you'll see why they made this album the way it is.  Thom Yorke was so fed up with trying to please everybody that he just decided to say &quot;screw this, we're gonna make music we like.&quot;  So Radiohead did and they ended up with this wonderful concept album about escape, divorce, despair, and death.  If you don't like this album its because Radiohead made music they like and they don't care what you think
B0000021RD|5.0|It's really hard to say which of Chicago's albums is the best, because there are 26 of them, all with good tunes (except a few bad 80s albums in there. But we have to forgive them, as 60% of 80s music is crap), but I've gotta say that Chicago 2 is nearly their best. I started loving Chicago before their 80s ballad stage, so I get really annoyed when they're referred to as a ballad band, because they're not. It just happens that their 2 most famous songs (If you leave me Now, Hard to Say I'm Sorry - the best 80s song ever written) were ballads. <BR>This album is inbetween. The songs are all very easy to listen to, nice tunes, with Robert Lamm's smooth voice making them even more so. It's also strung together really well. The order they've put all the songs makes sense. <BR>Pankow's 'Ballad for a Girl in Bucchanan' is great. 25 or 6 to 4 was their most successful tune from this album. This song kind of sums up Chicago's style - great tune, great brass, great bassline with a great guitar solo - Terry Kath doesn't get enough credit (that's been said a billion times, but I just have to repeat it).<BR>Where do we go from Here was Cetera's first song writing credit (he wrote it in hospital with a broken jaw, while watching the first moon landing), and it's good. It Better End Soon is the most rock style tune on the album. <BR>Prelude and the rest of the 'classical suite' is quite odd. I'm a classical musician, and at first I thought it was dumb, but I've listened to it so much that I like it now. I love how it turns into a slow song with Terry Kath singing at the end.<BR>If you're a Chicago fan, you'll love this album.<BR>If you're someone who thinks that all Chicago can write are ballads, please listen to Chicago's albums 1-11 to clarify that they do other good stuff as well. Don't bother with too much after Chicago 11, because it's after Kath died, and there aren't too many brilliant songs after that. Unless you love the 80s sythesizer stage.

0671027344|5.0|...This is a book of letters written by a young man named Charlie, who is a freshman in high school. It goes from a few days before high school starts, until the end of the summer before <BR>sophomore year. This book depicts an average American teenage <BR>life with immense verisimilitude. (...)From page one Stephen Chbosky's The Perks Of Being A Wallflower engages, intrigues, and astonishes its readers. This is a tale of a confused lost boy with a lot to offer the world. Charlie, the main character, isn't your average teenage boy; he is an outwardly emotional young man who intimately describes the hardships of high school. Chbosky so eloquently describes, in detail, the hardships endured by his young main character, Charlie. Charlie simulates many adults lives growing up as confused, struggling adolescents. Charlie is by no means popular, yet has close sincere friends , whom he loves dearly.  When everything goes wrong and he loses his friends he shares with us, the readers, the agonizing pain.  Charlie tells his story through anonymous letters; to whom he writes we will never know.  All we know is that we are Charlie and Charlie is us. The story takes place Charlie's freshman year of high school.  By the end of the book Charlie goes from an insecure, shy wallflower, to an insightful, confident wallflower. If your in a bookstore and and pass up The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, you will really be missing out on a spectacular novel with profound twists and turns, keeping you on the edge of your seat.
B00005OCMR|1.0|I ordered the movie about three weeks ago out of curiously. The Movie is really boring and outdated and stupid. The graphics are horrible and are too square. The plot is horrible too. Jeff Bridges is hot in the movie but thats about it. I don't like the plot of some guy getting put into a computer and having to fight his way out.
B00005R87Q|4.0|Although the storyline is Point Break, it was never meant to be a plot to challenge the brain.  Nobody cares about the storyline - just show us the cars and special effects - just like with \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\".  It's OK to buy a movie because it gives you an adrenaline rush, or it looks and sounds good in your home theater. That's what this movie does on both counts - very well...
B0000021RG|5.0|Shame on the reviewers who were so critical of this CD! I do realize that this has technical flaws (making me give it four and one-half stars for that reason), HOWEVER, it still rocks! There are some songs included that I personally don't care for, but it is still interesting to hear so many great early songs from the original members and L-O-N-G jams such as on SOUTH CALIFORNIA PURPLES and SING A MEAN TUNE KID. It gives a refreshing picture on a group that eventually turned into a &quot;loung act&quot; playing alongside Neil Diamond. When this was recorded the group was creative with a hard-rock edge. Hearing this for me has been like reliving the first few times I heard the Beatles' &quot;WHITE ALBUM&quot; because I knew some of the songs but was introduced to many great songs in a big bunch. Favorites to me are FANCY COLORS and HAPPY CAUSE I'M GOING HOME because of the strong positive emotions produced with the pretty melodies. Maybe the live Japan CD is superior (I haven't heard it) and I was dissapointed in BEGINNINGS for abruptly ending without any attempt to reproduce the wonderful single version, but wow, how can you guys be so critical of such a fantastic live album. The energy is high and the music soars! It is worth twenty bucks and then some! I only wish I could have seen this lineup instead of the sad &quot;tribute band&quot; playing in Las Vegas hotels now. Look to the past with this group and hopefully you will see why I feel so strongly about this CD!
B00003CWL6|5.0|I am not a movie buff, preferring real life to the often contrived plots that fall short of the real dramas of real people I meet in everyday life. But for once, I see the point in making a film, and in watching it. From the first moment and movement, every detail falls into place in a tale draws the viewer (me, at any rate) inexorably into the midst of characters portrayed so believably and nuanced, warts and all, that one ends up with nothing but compassion for the human condition. The aftermath of the experience is not a celebration of destruction, but Lester`s statement of thankfulness &quot;for every moment of my stupid little life&quot;. This thankfulness transmits through every tragicomic and gruesome scene of the drama, every scene revealing nuances and dimensions that grow with new viewings. And this thankfulness I wish to extend to a director and a unique group of actors (all throwing in memorable and believable performances) that have given an experience not to be forgotten.
B000002BBY|1.0|By the time I got to \\"Roll with It,\\" I knew this was some of the most unoriginal music I'd ever heard. The one star rating is a bit unfair though; I never made it through the entire record. <br />Do you like this music? Try sinking your teeth into Bon Jovi's \\"Slippery When Wet\\" or Huey Lewis & the News' \\"Sports.\\" You'll be spellbound by these Rock 'n Roll masterpieces.
B000000W9Z|4.0|I dont know what it is. <br />It seems like there are these grossly underrated, underappreciated works of art out there that go completely unnoticed and are shuffled to the back of the deck. &quot;Outside,&quot; a concept album by David Bowie, is indubitably one of those masterpieces. A journalistic, self-penetrating work with serious implications in relation to existence. Much like Pink Floyds &quot;The Final Cut,&quot; which after long scrutinization, I have deemed their finest album.<br />This 1995 release, as a matter of fact, came out just before I travelled in Costa Rica, so I had this along with me. I remember watching Arenal Volcano erupt while I was listening to &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot; on a portable CD player and smoking a cigarette and drinking a martini.<br />Not like that makes me biased or anything.....
B00005BL2A|5.0|Simply exciting. I don't like several songs like &quot;I feel loved&quot;, but &quot;When the body speaks&quot;, &quot;Goodnight lovers&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot; are very good. Simply Depeche Mode...

0446677450|1.0|This book passes off boring stories of flipping property and investing in mutual funds as investment advice.  I think his approach is shallow and borderline reckless.

B000002N3N|5.0|Of all the Enya albums I have, \\"The Memory Of Trees\\" is my favorite.  All the instruments you hear (many!) are performed by Enya!! (very impressive)  The opening track with the same title, in my opinion, is her most inspiring and strongest composition she has ever written.  The melody is simple but the voice harmony and instruments adds a whole new dimension to the composition.  \\"Anywhere Is\\" is a catchy, upbeat composition.  The lyrics are interesting to listen to.  Again, the instrumentation adds depth to the song.  Listen for all the hidden harmonies!  The melody is easy to find!  \\"Pax Deorum\\" is a mysterious chant sung in latin.  In between the chants, there is a beautiful, slow interlude.  \\"Athair Ar Neamh\\" is sung in Gaelic.  The melody is beautiful and the vocals put you in a transcending state.  \\"From Where I Am\\" is a beautiful, melodic piano solo.  \\"China Roses\\" is mesmerizing!  The lyrics and instrumentation is superb!  The song is sung at a slow to moderate tempo with a flowing quality.  \\"Hope Has A Place\\" is a peaceful song that sounds almost like a hymn.  \\"Tea House Moon\\" is a fantastic instrumental with an Oriental sound.  \\"Once You Had Gold\\" is another peaceful song with a slow, memorable melody.  \\"La Sonadora\\" is a mysterious song sung in Spanish.  The last song, \\"On My Way Home\\" is fantastic.  A wonderful closure that is so inspiring to hear!  Strong instrumentation!!<br />I highly recommend this album.  Every song on this album is  wonderful!!  The album is great for background music at weddings, parties, studying, bedtime (my fave) and any other time.  This was 1995's \\"Best New Age Album\\" at the Grammy's!! Buy Now!!!  You must be already thinking of Enya if you are browsing her music page, so take the last step and purchase it.  You will not regret it!!  Check out my other reviews on Enya's albums.

B00003CXCQ|5.0|Let's face it, Disney is the big name it is for a reason.  That reason being - you aren't let down.  Sure, you've seen Snow White, but this version brings DVD to a whole new level.  The extras are interesting, entertaining, and creatively produced.  The magic of Disney continues on, never breaking the illusion while offering up secrets of the production.  As usual, Disney takes to mind it's whole audience by giving you extras that will entertain at least one member of your family at any given time.  And the Barbra Streisand version of Someday My Prince Will Come is stirring, to say the least.  For fans of Snow White, or fans of Disney in general, you will not be disappointed!
B00003CX96|5.0|what an inspirational picture. one of my all time favorites. the fantastic musical score is what puts it over the top. everyone from ages 10 to 75 will run out and hop on their ten-speed as soon the credits finish. Bravo!
6305736650|5.0|I'm sure all the reviews of this film here describe just about everything about this movie.(I admit I have not read them all)..I would point out how terrific Sam is at the piano, not only with &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, but playing other tunes too, including &quot;It Had To Be You&quot;. Notice what a great time the whole gang at Rick's is having singing along with Dooley. This entire scene could probably not even exist in a contemporary movie, since the real fun of singing all with the piano player is just about a vanished art/pastime...Anyway, everybody should see this one. You can be 7 or 110, it does not matter, there is nothing offensive.You may not always like Rick's hard bitten character, but you'll change your mind at the end!
B00005QIPH|2.0|This band is just another one of them carbon copies of Sublime.
B000006OBQ|5.0|..It's interesting too in that it shows at age 50 (and Count and many of  his players were quite a bit older than Frank,Count still swinging, here at age 62!!),and during the middle of Beatlemania, these guys could still do their stuff live, and close to perfect!! Think of what the later rockers were doing at a similar point time in their careers, and you may appreciate even more what I mean. True, none of these versions are as good as any of the studio releases, but they're different,and offer a new insight into the phenomenal FS career,not to mention the great Count Basie too,in my view the greatest of all swing/jazz bands! SHADOW OF YOUR SMILE is beautifully done here, and may be the only FS version out there. GET ME TO THE CHURCH ON TIME, also I think the only FS version, and great fun. MAKIN WHOOPEE just as hilarious as ever, the tongue in cheek follow up to GET ME TO THE CHURCH. (BTW, how many of today's hits have anywhere near the humor of these old gems!?) True, the ballads like SEPTEMBER OF MY YEARS &  VERY GOOD YEAR don't have that rich string/orchestral backing,but they're still fine. ONE FOR MY BABY and ANGELS EYES are also terrifically done. Remember, this is a LIVE recording, and as such is not flawless, but as a live show it is as close to perfect as you can get!Not to mention that there are over twenty tunes here!
B000002KCF|5.0|I was first introduced to Michael Franks through his &quot;Passionfruit&quot; album.  When I heard it shortly after its release, I knew that I had to have EVERY Michael Franks composition available.  Over the past 10 or 15 years, I've attempted to do just that.  While I can't pick a favorite, &quot;The Art of Tea&quot; is among my favorite CDs of all time.  Quite FRANKly, Michael FRANKS is a lyrical genius.
B000002JKA|4.0|Well, I have to admit, I made a HUGE mistake.  I bought Dream Theater's best cd, SFaM  first, and expected their other stuff to be similar.  The closest thing to that cd in my eyes, is Falling into Infinity.  But anyway.  Awake was a great cd, but a lot heavier than what I am used to from them.  Songs like &quot;The Mirror&quot; seem to ruin the cd for me.  It's a GREAT cd to listen to when you're angered or working out, but if you want to sit back and just listen.... don't buy this cd.  Got with something lighter from DT.  There are 3 WONDERFUL songs on this cd, one being &quot;The Silent Man&quot;  another being &quot;Voices&quot; and the last being &quot;caught in a web&quot;  They are some of my favorite DT songs, and make this cd worth buying.  How you link the Silent Man into The Mirror is beyond me though... leave it to good ol Dream Theater.
B000003BE4|3.0|The Stones' fourth US LP found the band in transition between its early R&amp;B apery and the original work that would find full fruition two decades further on. The song list combines covers of American hits with riff-heavy originals sparked with youthful anger and alienation. Their first self-penned hit, \\"The Last Time,\\" and the rock anthem \\"Satisfaction,\\" anchor the LP's original work.<br />Though the Stones had exquisite taste in cover songs, they were usually outdone by contemporaries on both sides of the Atlantic. In the USA, Barry &amp; The Remains 1966 take of Don Covay's \\"Mercy Mercy\\" leaves Jagger and Richards sounding anemic, and the Sonics' explosive rendition of Marvin Gaye's \\"Hitch Hike\\" obliterates the pedestrian reading offered here.<br />Closer to home, the Pretty Things' cover of Solomon Burke's \\"Cry to Me\\" (delivered to market a full month before the Stones') is head and shoulders above Jagger's lethargic vocal and Richards' misplaced blues noodlings. The comparison refutes the suggestion that the Pretty Things were little more than Stones followers. Finally, the soulfulness and vocal harmony of the Hollies cover of Otis Reddings' \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\" leaves the Stones dusting themselves off.<br />Though Jagger and Richards had placed original tunes on earlier albums, their contributions here show the first inklings of the compositional talent exploited so fully in the 80s and 90s. Embryonic in sophistication and derivative in approach, the original tracks substitute catchy (though certainly memorable) riffs for melodies, and the lyrics still lean more towards strings of clichés than exposition of new human insight.<br />\\"The Last Time\\" and \\"Satisfaction\\" express the bottled-up anger and stridency of youth, though not nearly as profoundly as contemporary masterpieces like The Who's \\"My Generation.\\" Charlie Watts ever-so-polite drumming couldn't provide the carnal punch of Keith Moon's full-kit manhandlings, and despite the plaudits given Keith Richards' playing, it was never the sonic hammer wielded by Pete Townshend.<br />\\"Play With Fire\\" at once nods to the then-current folk-rock fad and anticipates the ornate sounds pioneered by The Left Banke (something the Stones would visit on \\"Their Satanic Majesty's Request\\"). American listeners will want to consult a mid-60s London social atlas to fully relish the details of these class-conscious lyrics. All listeners should review the Stones' financial portfolios to appreciate the irony of the then-wealthy Jagger complaining of his treatment at the hands of rich women.<br />Andrew Loog Oldham's production is uncharacteristically thin for an era reliant on punchy, compressed mixes destined for AM radio play. While other records of the era leap from the speakers and grab the listener by the throat, these tracks (save \\"Satisfaction,\\" which benefits from the fuzztone guitar riff and a hot bass mix) are tinny. The UK release of this title, issued a month after the US edition, drops the hits (\\"Satisfaction\\" \\"The Last Time\\") and adds \\"She Says Yeah,\\" \\"Heart of Stone,\\" \\"I'm Free,\\" and the Chuck Berry cover, \\"Talkin' Bout You.\\" Unfortunately, the US edition is all that's legitimately available.<br />Overall this is a middling effort from a band still struggling to find an original identity. The tip-of-the-hat to their R&amp;B influences is interesting more for its history (and its later impact) than for the actual cover work itself. The original songwriting, though beginning to pick up some steam, is still a long ways off from the mature work that would carve the band's place in history.
0451205146|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down. I remember vividly when this terrible battle hit the news and the papers. Once again our soldiers are sent into the absolute hell of combat and are left to fight for their lives in a situation that all the possible scenarios were not thought out. This book not only gives the reader the facts and stories from the soldiers themselves but also many of their thoughts before, during and after the battle. The book depicts well how good American Rangers are at their job and how unbelievably well trained and professional the Delta guys are. Although some people may be offended by the unfortunate killing of civilians - the book clearly points out how and why civilians were killed. This book &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; will give the reader an excellant fact based look into the horrors of combat and the outstanding abilities of our elite forces in action. Excellant!
0451191153|5.0|A breath taking story about someone who made it to the top when everyone spat at him. a legend about a man who discovers his true love. for all those people who didnt like this book, you're probably one of those working class, disgruntled, and illiterate individuals who are pawns of our capitalistic society... you dont need. im sorry, but this book takes the cake. excellent choice for anyone who knows anything about literature.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead has done it again. Another wonderful and mind blowing album, unlike the the band's previous releases. I don't, however, view any of the band's albums as good or bad, because they are all good in their own right. Anyone who is a true Radiohead fan realizes that one of the most lovable aspects of the band is that each album is new, thought-provoking, and an epic step into an undiscovered void of emotions yet undiscovered.<br />It's true that Amnesiac is reminiscent of Kid A (they were recorded at the same time). I have heard it described as more &quot;easy on the ears&quot; than Kid A, and to me this is rather superficial. Amnesiac is the afterthought of Kid A,a realization, an understanding. It fits perfectly with Kid A, and is no more &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; than it. <br />Some savory tracks are the softly accusatory, passive threat of &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot;, and the dreamy, confusing, emotional &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot;. If you buy this album, and you're a real Radiohead fan, you will enjoy this consecutive step up from previous releases.
6304504012|5.0|Who knew Madonna could pull this off?  To be sure, this is an either love-it-or-hate-it film, but if you allow yourself to get swept up in the first few moments, and accept the fact that there is no dialogue, only song, you are guaranteed an almost singular theatrical experience.  I was prepared to dismiss this film as another &quot;event movie&quot; and unexpectedly found myself enjoying every frame.  Madonna proves she is more than simply capable as an actress - here, she gives a career-definining performance that few of her contemporaries could have ever delivered.  Banderas is equally superb as Che, and JOnathan Pryce shines as Peron.  Part history lesson, all glorious music, Alan Parker's definitive screen classic sprawls before you in an epic that cannot be dismissed.  Vocally, the singing is pitch perfect, far superior to the stage version with Patti Lupone.  And, far from being an excuse for Madonna to put her &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; days behind her, &quot;Evita&quot; is pure cinematic magic.  It's a shame people didn't give this movie alot more credit when it was released - sure, it won the Golden Globe for best Film and Madonna was named Best Actress (deservedly.)  But Oscars were denied to all but the Best Song &quot;You Must Love Me&quot; a plea for forgiveness that is painful to listen to, but grand nonetheless.  Truly a special, idiosyncractic film that takes the breath away from anyone who allows themselves to be taken.  Be taken!  This is why film exists in the first place - it nutures and comforts, horrifies and excites all at once!  If you give it a chance, you'll be glad you experienced it.  A Winner!
B00004X0ER|5.0|This guys didn't jump the retro-rock bandwagon (like the Strokes and its likes) -- the hype caught up with them. The Hives has been kicking their style for a while now. I first heard them off a promo from Burning Heart Records about 5 years ago and I was blown away by the intensity and realness. I used to listen to bands like Lagwagon, Pennywise etc and they now seem very bland in comparison. This album kicks so much butt. \\"Main offender\\" and \\"Hate to say I told you so\\" are probably among the best songs I have heard in many many years. <BR>If you like gritty punk with a ton of attitude this album with be glued to your cd player.
0440219078|5.0|If you haven't read the book yet, be careful reading the reviews on this page. Some of them give away a great deal about the plot.<br />The most important theme, to me, was seeing the society through the perspective of its members. From our own society, we look at it and disagree with the rules, the structures, the lack of choice. We see so much that is missing. From within the society, nobody knows that it could be different. It's hard to understand this point of view, but _The Giver_ illustrates it clearly. <br />Another reviewer has complained that the community members could not call their society &quot;ideal&quot; because they have no comparisons. He's right to point this out, but in fact the community members never do make that comparison. Life is for them is the same always and everywhere.<br />I can understand parents' complaints about the scenes of killing. I would like to point out, though, that they may be overestimating the innocence of their children. I'm in my thirties now, but I clearly remember that most of my 5th grade class was fascinated by books about the Holocaust. The scenes in _The Giver_ are sterile, emotionless, clean; far from the horrors we hear of in the news. <br />On the other hand, I have no idea why anyone would object to the dream Jonas has early in the book. Sick? No way. It's about the healthiest thing that happens to him.
B00005OWEG|5.0|I always loved Apocalypse Now but I believe the directors cut is superior. With the exception of the French Plantation segment,the new version filled in alot of gaps that needed to be filled.I remember seeing the documentary Hearts of Darkness and always wanting to see the sceens that were cut from in their entirety.I was always wishing that they would make it onto extras of a DVD but they nowhere to be found on the original DVD.<BR>And now with Redux not only do we get to see the sceens,but they are a regular part of the film.This is a good release,anybody want to buy an orginal Apocalypse Now DVD so I can buy this (LOL)
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I have seen this movie like everyday and i love it its has a great romantic theme and how sometimes you have to pretend just to make others happy.
B00003000M|4.0|This is the album that you'll always be up to listening to, you'll never mention it to friends, but somehow it will randomly come up and you'll realize that every single one of your friends owns a copy. One of my friends, coincidently, left a copy in my car for about a week and I couldn't take it out of the player. I should explain, now, that I am notorious for changing the cd every 2 songs or so, so for me to leave this CD in repeating for a week is really something else. It's a great album.
B00000DFMN|5.0|This album was so far ahead of it's time it's not even funny.  It's still a great listen today... although I'd imagine it holds a greater appeal for those who loved it back in 84, like me.
B00005TT77|5.0|Being a huge Beatles fan, it didn't take me much to buy this album. The artists and bands recruited for this stunning soundtrack were well picked. Considering how wonderful this album is, it might as well be an unofficial tribute album to The Beatles. Not only did the artists do a faithful rendition of their version of a Beatles song but they also were able to recapture the spirit of The Beatles in the song. Even my least favorite vocalist Eddie Vedder did a bang up job on &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;. Perhaps that was because he was uncumbered by the distorted guitars of his band Pearl Jam that allowed Vedder to show the listener what he is truly capable of as an artist. I absolutely adored Rufus Wainwright's beautiful cover of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; along with Sarah McLachlan's &quot;Blackbird&quot;. However my very personal favorite track on this entire album is Nick Cave's breathtaking &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Nick Cave is my very favorite male vocalist and his deep, rich baritone voice made the song even more amazing. I loved every track on the album. Not a single dud on here which surprises me since i am not a fan of Ben Harper, Eddie Vedder and The Stereophonics. This collection of Beatles covers is a must-have for Beatles fans. I don't think they will be disappointed in it at all.
B00005R87Q|4.0|&quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; is not an ordinary movie. It's one of the biggest box-office suprises this year and when you take a <BR>detailed look at the screenplay you might wonder how this movie became such a huge hit. The formula is simple but effective; <BR>Two actors with charisma,(Paul Walker is a real hunk, who has a rather calm acting style in the footsteps of Keanu Reeves and if you close your eyes you might think you are listening to Keanu.<BR>Vin Diesel has a very prominent appearance, and his talent caught Steven Spielberg's attention who did cast him in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. In &quot;Boiler Room&quot; and &quot;Pitch Black&quot; he gave solid performances. But for both actors $10,000,000 + salary barrier was exceeded after the huge success of &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot;),<BR>Hot looking but unknown actresses (Monica Tamayo,Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez),<BR>Dynamic soundtrack with literally furious Hip-Hop and R&amp;B songs by popular artists of the genre (including Ja Rule, Limp Bizkit, Faith Evans, R. Kelly, Ashanti, Petey Pablo, Shade Sheist, Gotti etc.)<BR>And most importantly fast hot cars giving us all the excitement and big quantities of adrenaline. <BR>One has to be very optimistic to be able to speak of big performances of the actors or plausibility of the plot, but obviously this formula is working. The concept of street racing is attractive for most of us, maybe even seen as a symbol of freedom, and this cultural phenomenon was successfully made into a movie. (I'm still wondering if the producers of &quot;Grease&quot; are the parents from the producers of &quot;Fast&amp;Furious&quot; ;)<BR>The stimulation doesn't come through the plot but simply through watching all those custom made cars, hence I would highly recommend the DVD with many extras for enjoying the movie over and over, but I wanna repeat a warning from the &quot;Fast&amp;Furious&quot; team: <BR>All of the racing stunts in The Fast and the Furious were performed in a staged environment by professionals with years of training and experience. Please do not try any of these yourself. Be smart. Drive safe. Stay legal.
0767803434|5.0|This was in perfect Harrison Ford fasion. Action, action, and oh yes action. From Han Solo to Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford is known for action movies and this one doesn't disapoint. A definite must see for anyone who enjoyed his other films.
B00005OCMR|5.0|I held off on the first DVD release of Tron hoping that something like this would be created, and am I ever glad I did!<br />The intro to the main menu is pretty cool, but the scene selection menus are static and rather boring! The picture quality is awsome though, far better than I had hoped, and anamorphic too. The extras are amazing! Much more than I had expected. They even included promotional stills of the arcade machines, hand-held electronic games, and action figure sets! Talk about details!<br />The only problem I had was that it seemed to pause longer than it should while browsing through the scene selection menus on disc 1, and through the production stills on disc 2. Mabey its just my player (JVC XV-S60BK - 1 week old). I dunno, it never happened before with any other disc.<br />In any case, the Tron 20th Anniversary Edition DVD is great, buy it &amp; love it, &amp; use the old one for a drink coaster.<br />P.S. Let's hope Disney Ltd. has a soul and decides to rerelease THE BLACK HOLE as a simular 2 disc 'Special Edition'.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Omigod, do I love this album! I'm 59 years old, and when I put this in my CD player, it is the 60's again. It gives me such pleasure to hear such fabulous music still coming from Bob Dylan--and some hope, too! Maybe we really can be 'forever young.'
