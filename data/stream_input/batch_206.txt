B00JE26EFU|1|No so good. Smells too strong
B00AREI3BC|5|Works great and is sulfate free.  Make my hair feel great.
B00AE07AF4|1|Returned because the picture shows the old formula but Clear has repacked and changed the formula and it is NOT the same.  Totally dries out my hair.  The only thing I can think of is there is less tea tree oil...since it is no longer on the front of the bottle.  Looks like I have to find something else.  Always nice when you find something that works and it is changed.
B009069EA2|5|Smells great.
B00QG9LOM2|5|This takes drying racks to a whole new level. Right out of the box it was clear; this is so easy to use and so sturdy. This solves so many problems with normal straight wire drying racks.<br /><br />This is incredibly handsome - the sky blue plastic and stainless steel look wonderful. If you pulled this out on your boat, or balcony, or backyard, you would never be embarrassed with the look. In a good way, the rack looks European. I could easily picture this on a balcony in a European home.<br /><br />After thinking about this for a short while, it became clear this rack is useful for a lot of people: college, camping (not rustic camping but drive up campsites), beach house, boat, balcony in the city, backyard, art project drying, laundry room, or the deck. If you really wanted to get rid of the dryer and you lived alone, this is the perfect drying rack. This could easily replace the dryer.<br /><br />This is such a sturdy rack. A lot of racks will tip over if you overload one side, not this rack. Everything is designed so that it is very difficult to tip over no matter how much you load up one side. Setting it up is so easy - spread open the two legs, the center small rack locks in place and keeps this stable on the floor. Then lift either wing up to the angle you want, because the center hinge has some friction, the wings stay exactly where you put them (what a great feature compared to those darn wire racks). Finally, lift up the support bar, snap the blue plastic holder in place, and then swing up the blue plastic lock. It takes more time to explain it than it does to set it up. With the wings flat, I was able to put a pair of wet jeans on the end bar - the rack did not tip over. Almost every rack I've ever seen falls over if you do that.<br /><br />Folding the rack is super-fast. Release the two blue locking clips, pull up on the wing, the support arm will fall down, push the wings down, now lift up the center rack to release the two sides, and fold the whole thing up. It takes around 30 seconds to fold up, it is that easy. The whole rack has exactly the right weight - not too heavy and not too light.<br /><br />I can't believe how many pieces of clothing fit on this. I was able to put just about a full laundry load on here.<br /><br />There is an ingenious clip that took me some time to figure out. These three clips are a series of plastic loops that will hold things tightly. The clips can be moved to any of the bars. These things are brilliant - the clip will hold hangers in place so you can hang 6 to 10 shirts on one side of the rack. They clips will hold hosiery, underwear, athletic shorts, socks, kitchen towels, wash cloths - anything that can be pressed between the loops. The advantage of these hooks - things will not blow away in the wind. And they eliminate the need for clothes pins.<br /><br />The four blue clips on the bottom, I haven't really figured out yet. They work well for shoes - you can hang two pairs of shoes on them. It seems like a lot of engineering for shoes.<br /><br />Do you get the idea that I love this rack? Yeah - it is truly amazing. Ikea sells a white wire rack for around $15. That thing is utilitarian and kind of works. At the time of writing this review, the Ohuhu rack costs around $35. The rack is a little pricey, but after using it, the thing is worth every single penny of that more premium price.<br /><br />I was provided a review sample.ing up.

B00K9NUAU8|5|works perfect<br />will buy it again
B00H8Z7DIM|1|I was very disappointed with this.  It doesn't do anything for the bottom of my heels. The massager only does one thing really,  besides the air inflation.  The massaging (rolling) motion on the bottom of your feet is the same thing over and over with no other options.  I tried to send it back for a refund but the seller would not do it as I was 3 weeks past the 30 day return period.  It doesn't do much to relieve my foot pain and has become a pretty expensive paper weight.
B001EO5WYA|1|I have used the Color Assure shampoo and Color Ensure conditioner for several years and decided to buy the big bottles to save some money.  The big bottles were pink, not silver (shampoo) and white (conditioner), so I was wondering if I got the real stuff.  The pink bottle shampoo is horrible, see my review.  The pink bottle conditioner is even worse.  When I opened the bottle I was overwhelmed by the smell of marijuana!  I didn't even realize that the smell was coming from the conditioner bottle, I live in a condo building and I was thinking maybe I was getting smoke smell from a neighbor or something.  Then I realized it was coming from the conditioner bottle!  Ewww!  The white bottle conditioner smells great.  I went to the Nexxus web site and am dismayed to find out that they have changed the products.  There are plenty of complaints on that web site, though I didn't see anyone describing the new smell as \\"pot\\".  There's no way I'm going to use these new products on my hair, I'm afraid the shampoo will dry it out very badly and the conditioner will leave me smelling like I just got high.  I guess I'll have to hunt down the old products in the store and then when my stockpile runs out I'll have to switch to other products.  Too bad, the old products were really great, Nexxus should have just left them alone.
B000ZCVVI8|5|Smells so much better than a plain one! Love it
B0047FHTEY|5|Just as described. Good item. Good Seller.
B00C765L7W|5|Love then smell and its not over powering like some others. Had a customer where I work a  get it for me for Christmas. The best gift I have gotten
B005FK3M46|3|While these look like nice quality plates, the full nail designs are TINY, even more so than many other plates. I thought since Gals are products made by Cheeky, they'd be the size of newer CHeeky products - they are not. The individual designs don't have much detail, and there aren't many of them. The nail tip designs, are oddly large considering how small the \\"full\\" nail designs are, but since I file my nails to an oval shape, they aren't much use to me unless I want to put them in the middle of my nail. So once again, I have another collection of plates that won't fit my thumbs or even moderate length nails. Each is 1/2 inch wide by 1/2 inch tall, from the center, so actually SMALLER than Konad because of the rounded base.<br />If you have small and short nails, then you'll probably enjoy these. If you are a professional who has to deal with many nail sizes, stick with the Cheeky XL plates or just don't taunt your customers with larger nails with these designs so they won't know about what they can't have. Or get busy coming up with a different design for thumbs. I like the ease of picking a plate and knowing it will work on all of my nails. I guess that's too much to expect again. Big waste of my money.
B001JKTTVQ|3|I have a love/hate for these brushes. Overall they are not bad, I really enjoy having access to brushes while doing my make-up and others' make-up as well. The brushes are somewhat hard which makes it difficult to apply blushes and foundation and some of the bristles come off on your face if you apply it too hard which is a real turn off and frustrating. The smaller brushes and the eyeshadow brushes are very ideal for small areas that you want touch up and the eyebrow brush/comb combo are very ideal, although I wished they would have thrown in a mascara brush.
B00BDJ9M2E|5|I have used this color in the past because it is the closest i have found to my original color and it adds shine.  Mega reds' the only hair color that does not dull in my hair within the first month. The shine lasts.It arrived about a week early so that was nice .  Love Mega Reds!
B0018MQHO2|5|I love the baby soft smooth feet I now have because of this product.  It is super affordable and does an awesome job!
B009L0ZP50|4|Sparkly glaze is a wonderful color to put on the top of another darker color... it makes your pedi shine and also makes it last<br />alot longer. It just gives your toes that extra glamour!
B000GLRREU|5|excelente
B00H8Z2LNY|5|Arrived on time.  Great product.  I use it everyday!
B00I04BUYS|4|These are really pretty. I received the purple one, which was the one I wanted. I don't know why they show 2 at a time. They are very feminine. I use mine as a hat pin. Please know that to use as a hat pin your hat should have  large stiching because the pins on the broach are larger than a Bobby pin.
B00BJ7T9RI|5|Good product and protects well.  this product is hard to find; so I was very delighted to find it here on line.  It is a good product for those who like extra protection and it is not greasy.  it also was a good price.
B007YUIMRM|5|Was wondering how a basil handsoap would smell... so I ordered a 3 pack blindly!  Can't say I'm disappointed!  This is a nice quality, fragrant soap and basil smells great as a soap!
B0025Z3EHO|5|I am very impressed with the quality of this product. It goes on smooth and lasts better than other body creams. Great buy!
B009ZYG2JA|5|It does what I hoped it would do and was not greasy. would recomend it to a friend, my hair was falling out when I started using it
B001711E5G|5|great for people who get a lot of sun  helps people who have skin cancer!.  the only problem has been finding it.  used to be able to get in stores but can not find it anywhere but on website.
B00HFQQ0VU|2|I agonized about the rating to give this product.  On the one hand, I loved it for the two months it worked.  During the first two months, I discovered that it was easy to use and effective.  After just six weeks' use, my dentist's hygienist commented on noticeably improved gum conditions.  Unfortunately, at the end of that two month period the pump suddenly lost 2/3 of its pressure and it is now useless.  I may buy another because I liked it so much and hope that the one I received was an anomaly.
B008RZ3A7A|5|beautiful 1cm so they fit easily on all of my nails :)
B00LAXI61Q|5|Thus bag actually looks nice than the picture. I am waiting for my wife to put it on and I will update my rating but now five star for its beauty
B00A69PTHY|5|This did exactly what I needed it to do it went on and stayed on though an entire pool party, even with kids climbing on my back it stayed on. It also looked pretty good too.<br /><br />Getting it off is a chore though, so don't put it in your face or anywhere else you don't want it for a week.
B00021BRBI|4|I first got the Ginger Ale Pick-Me-Up Spray for my mother for Christmas last year, but I soon snatched the spray from her bathroom to keep for myself. This spray smells exactly like ginger ale, including the sensation of bubbles filling your nose. Unfortunatly, it doesn't last very long, but it isn't too expensive, and it smells so great you soon forget about the minor expense of having to buy more bottles. I definetly recomend this to any teen or young adult as a fun, flirty fragrance for daytime.
B0007MW2ZW|5|This shaving cream smells awesome and lathers well.  Prompt delivery.
B00ESNF68Q|5|Great brand. I use oils all the time.
B003AO4SPQ|5|The best hairdryer you could purchase . Light weight & fast drying ! Love it ... Very pricey though ..
B0009MHJE4|5|Works good for my hands, I have a situation in my hands, I tried differents creams but only this helps my skin
B004HCA4QC|5|I love this product, Manuka Honey and Rosehip Oil Facial Serum.  I preferred the older formulation, as it was more emollient, but the new blend is also very nice.  It is still mildly moisturizing, for my skin, and I believe would work beautifully for most skin types, except for the very driest.
B002C7DK7Y|4|Works pretty well but you'll need a steady hand.
B00EE09VBQ|5|I have used this product for about a month and can already see a difference. My hair looks healthier and has grown a bit. I have to say that even my nails have been growing faster. I love this product and would recommend it.
B0013MTHWQ|5|In seconds you clean the whole area out of hair. Amazing!!!<br />The refill lasts for a long time.<br />Best razor I've tried! Trully recommend it!
B005X2F7JY|5|Love it!
B009LAQEJQ|5|My sister in law bought me this for Christmas a year ago. I absolutely LOVE this stuff. smells great, feels amazing and fresh. My skin is literally glowing and people ask me all the time what I use. I had to review this because of all the terrible reviews. People complain too much and don't see good in things and if they do see the good they won't comment. So here is mine I LOVE IT and will continue to use!
B004LXHPRI|3|its a really good color, but it slides when u wear it.
B005I03536|3|Not sure if I received a bad batch but 2 out of 3 snapped when I used them for the first time and probably got 2-3 more uses out of the ones that didn't snap.
B003Y0504E|2|The product was received promptly. However, the syringe is unlabeled and no where in instructions (insert) do you read the words \\"44% carbomide peroxide\\" nor is 44% seen in the ingredient list--the word \\"carbomer\\" is listed as the 4th ingredient.Is \\"Whitening System Advanced\\" the name of the company? What is the country of origin of this product? The insert doesnt have the manufacturers name of business or how to contact them. This doesnt follow the Basic Label Requirements in the US. Does it contains 44%, 22%, 16%, or 35% carbomide peroxide?  How can I be sure what this syringe really contains without a proper label?  I would be fired if i left an unlabeled syringe around at work to harm others. Whether or not it works is to be determined.
B00EXPZCQA|5|I COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT MY PALOMA PICASSO! I RECEIVE COMPLIMENTS EVERY TIME I WEAR IT!
B003WR3QSG|5|I purchased this item last July and my husband absolutely loves it. He has asked on more than one occasion if it was Honey Badger hair as that would make it that much cooler if it were.
B0079R6BD2|5|Got it 2 weeks ago and I feel like my hair is healthier and stronger. Great product so far, love the natural ingredients vs all the chemicals in hair loss products I've used in the past. Will update in a couple of months!
B005FAC756|5|I works great
B000GHWTPQ|5|Another of my favorite fragrances!
B00AFX1SX0|1|Love the color and texture, HATE the fragrance. It's like toxic strawberry - horrible. Granted, I'm a whole foods kind-of gal so if you like super strong synthentic smells, you will like this. If only they made it without the fragrance I would love them - 5 stars! The color on this one is a little whitish because of  all the shimmer. The papaya has less whitish shimmer to it and more color.
B0017SURSY|4|I buy these paper towels all the time at Costco. I usually pay 20.00 dollars for them there. They seem to work really well to clean my messy house up everyday.
B00DP8PMLG|5|Great product love it!
B0007MW2ZW|5|This is a great shaving cream, which you can probably guess based on all the reviews.  The smell is not overwhelming to me but if anything bothers someone, you might find it to strong.<br /><br />Here's a tip I learned through trial and error.  I started just putting a gob of the stuff directly onto my brush and doing a face lather.  Then I just got a stoneware mug out of the cabinet so I could spin up a lather better.  In both cases the cream turns into plaster and clogs up my razor really quickly.<br /><br />Add a liberal amount of water to the cream while lathering it up in your mug to help alleviate that issue and you'll love this stuff.
B00365DABC|5|I used to use Cetaphil moisturizer at night time, but my skin didn't seem to handle it too well. I was bothered by its greasy feeling. It never seemed to soak into my skin, and I could still feel a heavy film of lotion on my face when I woke up in the morning. Cetaphil also had a tendency to make my face sting at times, especially when my skin was dry. I know it's great from some people, but for me, Cerave was better suited for my skin. It's more lightweight (but still very moisturizing), it absorbs well, never feels greasy, and I have never experienced any sort of a burning sensation with it.
B000BF3ZVA|5|really works
B00524U54K|4|Im seeing some improvements, I got a bottle at walmart a month ago and I was seeing a little bit of a diffrence , but its to soon to tell, I have a lot of issues with scarring , sun spots ( from not wearing sun screen when I was in the sun) and acne markings and I thought this would be a good product to get. I've been trying to succesfuly treat these problems for about 3 years now , the marking had faded, but, i want them completely gone. Ill update and take photos of the probem areas and take some more pic in about 5 months you can see the results.
B00ARTK9GY|4|works well. good product
B00LE26KFC|5|Good product
B0001ZMXSQ|1|I have been shaving my own head for almost 20 years now and this is by far the WORST pair of clippers I have ever used.<br /><br />Here are my list of reason why i dislike it so much...<br /><br />1) Ripped hair follicles out of my scalp. The 3-4 times I used this product, my head was left bleeding and sore.<br /><br />2) Huge pain to clean out the clippers themselves.<br /><br />3) Huge pain putting the clippers back together after cleaning. Extremely annoying to align the blades while trying to reassemble.<br /><br />4) The sectioning clips are cheap as could be. Broke one on the second use.<br /><br />You are better off spending a few extra bucks and getting yourself a better quality pair of hair clippers. Avoid at all costs. Would give negative stars if I was allowed.<br /><br />(NOTE: I did not buy these clippers from amazon, but I included 2 pictures to prove I own the razor to back up this negative review.)
B000SSUFWC|5|i love this brush. i thought i lost it for a couple of weeks and was very sad. great brush.
B008FP6KBU|5|It works really good and I love it a lot. The little brush is perfect for acrylic bows and I also got it in three weeks.
B0006H2ZLO|4|Ok, I have thick, thick, thick, coarse African-American hair. I have tried different relaxers all my life and they would just not work. I thought that I would be destined to a life of braids because my hair was sooooo unmanageble. Hair dressers would huff and puff while doing my hair and wonder why they could not tame it. Seriously, I have the worst, most resistant hair imaginable.    After I had taken my braids out I waited a week and put this relaxer on virgin hair that was used to regular braiding for about 2 years. I must say I was not impressed at first. It was straight but not bone straight. I believe this is due to the damage that was done by keeping my hair in braids for so long. Also, this product does not break the bonds in your hair like regular relaxers, it relaxes the tight coil curls. This is so much better for your hair.     After 8 weeks I did a touch up and the roots were seriously striaght. When my hair was wet you could see a definate difference betweeen the new growth and the rest of my hair. 10 weeks after that I did another touch up and I was amazed at how good my hair looks! If you have hair like mine you will need to smooth it with a flat iron, I suggest a ceramic one like the Maxi-Glide that has a comb attachment. My hair has more body, it does not just lay flat and limp against your head. Using Wen cleansing conditioner in conjuntion with the phytorelaxer has also helped my hair have bounce and shine and managability. I do not recommend waiting 10 weeks for a touch-up for most people but I have been taking the Phyto brand hair vitamins for the past 4 months and and ever since then my new growth has been more manageable and stronger.I have very minimal shedding.    I am not trying to push products here but if you have hair like this and you have tried everything and nothing works and it almost brings you to tears sometimes, I'm telling you try these things I suggest. A weight will be lifted and you can enjoy having beautiful hair like otherpeople do.    This product does have a little smell to it but NOTHING like regular relaxers. It has never burned or irritated my scalp either.
B00ANGIMOW|5|Can not go wrong it make you smell so good I was die to get it I'm so glad I did love it the best tryit you would love bit like I do
B00HB0QF4C|5|Hard to Get!  A wee bit pricey but Phenomenal Scent!<br />The French Police have nothing on you when you wear this!<br />Ans Remember!  Bring Protection!<br /><br />Bon Nuit<br /><br />Jonny G
B00070PNIM|5|I love this brush!  It gets through my thick hair and I use it with a hairdryer to straighten my curly hair.  Works great and good quality
B00156EX0G|5|I bought this lot because Bath and Body Works were very ignorant and discounted this scent. This is the best scent I have found they had/have. I can't understand how it could not be one of the most popular scent. Disappointed for not be able to buy anymore.
B0060E3P4S|5|If you're familiar with the mineralized duo fibre brushes from MAC, then this is the perfect set for you. I adore it.
B001ZD3DHI|5|For some reason, it's hard to find matte eyeshadow in stores. I love this. Exactly what I was looking for.
B00MR0AIY4|4|Good. How I was expecting.
B004JYL6F6|5|Let me start out by saying this product, like all pre workouts out there, will no doubt affect everyone differently.  But for me, I have not had a pump like this for 2-3 years.  I just got done lifting.  Took three tablets about 20 minutes prior to starting.  Unlike most NO2, I did not get the pump right away, or in the middle of the workout.  But afterward,  I feel a huge surge.<br />I did the same exact workout I usually do, with the same amount of water during, same bubble gum, only thing that was different was I forgot my usual headphones.  :)  But now I am a little jittery, and the pump is awesome and is lasting.<br />I would recommend this.
B000HQ0L2E|4|I just used it for the first time today.  It tore my back up pretty good because I couldn't get the right angles, but it got the job done.  Nothing really special about it, but I'm glad I bought it.
B000AUIFCA|5|Have several Braun electric tooth brushes and my son and daughter prefer the floss action heads the best. Not bad 3 heads for the price I paid.
B001ET73D8|2|Supposed to be recommended by dermatologists, however, this caused my combination skin to break out in acne. The advertising on the bottle says &#34;non-greasy formula that won't clog pores&#34; but that did not prove accurate for me. I have an oily T-zone and dry cheeks/jawline. It made part of all areas of my face break out.<br /><br />It's a little heavy for a moisturizer. You can definitely feel the sunscreen in it. I've used other similar facial moisturizers, so I know that often you can feel when there is sunscreen. But I've used a couple with sunscreen that felt a little lighter.
B005CHHO46|1|I'm a guy who's had professional laser hair removal in the salon to take care of body hair on my chest and arms. So going into at-home IPL hair removal, I at least had an inkling of what to expect. Anyone who's had &#34;real&#34; laser hair removal before will see right away that this unit is a worthless piece of garbage. I felt absolutely no difference in &#34;intensity&#34; between the lowest setting and the highest setting, and no pain at all. Now, I'm no masochist, but in order for a product like this to work, you should be feeling the light zapping your hair follicles. I even tested it on my leg hair, which is very dense, and still no pain. This alone would prove that this product has absolutely nowhere near enough power to actually zap hair follicles. No pain, no redness, no nothing. (I mention the redness because my skin, in addition to being fair, is also very sensitive and would usually redden for a few moments after zapping in the salon -- not so with the Remington.) Also, after repeated use on the same areas-- I'm the ideal candidate by the way (super pale skin, very dark hair), not a SINGLE hair has fallen out.<br /><br />I would advice anyone reading these reviews and considering purchasing this product to look very carefully at the glowing 5-star reviews, and check to see if those customers even have other reviewers, or if they mysteriously only decided to rate this product.<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake I made. Just wax, or epilate, or if you have money to blow, go to a salon and get it done professionally. Sure it's overpriced there and the technicians are usually careless, but at least the areas they zap will actually &#34;get&#34; the hair follicles, unlike the Remington I-Light Pro.
B001BR6AXW|5|The price of this was very good, much cheaper than what I use to buy at department stores. It's my wife's favorite scent and I can't find it at department stores anymore. The condition was new and it was exactly like what I use to buy at a store.
B001MA0QY2|5|Love it, fast shipping!!!! THANK YOU!
B002U774PK|5|Paid a lot for treatments that I wish now I had that cash. It was a lot of money.<br />This is a great buy and I can sit in bed and watch tv and make my face look better.<br />Need to do it now.<br />Bye
B000OYJ9AO|5|This is one of the best smelling lotions out there.  I love the way it absorbs quickly!  I recommend this product to everyone who wants a fresh feeling and clean smelling lotion.<br />It arrived a lot quicker than I thought it would.  It was wrapped with plenty of bubble wrap which left it in great condition.
B00HNJS23I|5|My hair stylist turned me on to this product. Keeps the frizz at bay while protecting hair from heat damage. Lovely light fragrance as well.
B0036YTW2E|3|cool product. yea its cool. I dont really know cause I have never used it before I just want a free sample.
B006E5A3PW|5|This is a wonderful product! My first use I felt a difference! My face is smooth and feels like my pores are 100% clear! I used some on my hands as well and they feel great too. Beauty Buddha is a great seller as well! Fast shipping and the product is well protected. I give them a 5 star as well!
B001AVNE9C|5|Works great as a base coat and a top coat👌👌
B00C93O4N0|5|Best stuff I have used great that it has SPF 15 protection as well no need so far for additional sunscreen in my daily use in the Midwest.
B008QMWPYS|1|This smells more like plastic than chamomile.  I really like this company, but I could not tolerate this smell.
B00KGJVVDK|5|I've been using this eye serum for about 3 days so far, and I'm really enjoying it!  It's very emollient, and feels wonderful under the eyes and over the orbital bone. I believe with continued use, I will see great results!  It smells divine, and most of all, I love that it's completely organic and non toxic. I highly recommend this wonderful product!
B0000535RC|5|I had never ever had an acne problem until recently small pimples her or there not and then I started to use this product, clear skin and great product by the way i don't have acne problems ,I will buy it a gain
B003Z4OD24|5|After using this 3-4 times a week, I really like it.  isn't really harsh on your skin when you are scrubbing, smells nice, leaves your skin nice and soft and smooth.  Bonus is that it doesn't dry my skin out or make it flaky.  Totally recommend.
B007WOOJEU|5|I have very dry sensitive skin. This product has a lovely light fragrance and makes the skin quite smooth. Love Inis products!
B005NFNXHO|4|Good coverup for specific areas lacking in fullness.  It covers up the areas really well.  It does take a little practice to get it dispersed just right.
B00385WMJQ|5|I've bought 3 of these now.  They're great.  I bought 1 as a gift, 1 for my daughter for when I put her hair in curlers, and 1 for myself.  I have long, thick, curly hair and it was hard to find a good shower cap to keep the water and moister out when I showered.  I straighten and then curl my hair, so I need to have that last for several days as it takes forever to straighten.  This works great!  It's large enough to hold all of my hair, even when I through it in curlers.
B00CEXQ51O|5|Smells really good. Last a long time. 1 month or more.
B00EZI0IGO|1|I got  what I paid for. I got this eyeliner because I had an awesome coupon to go with it. Read decent reviews so excited to buy. It was HORRIBLE :( the eyeliner is soooo runny and because it runs it sometimes dries blotchy. You have to wait until it fully dries or else it gets everywhere! You can't close your eyelid fully because it will get on the top of my eyelid. Also its definitely NOT water proof. It was so runny it ran into my eyelashes and made a mess. Not worth it and definitely cannot recommend this to anyone, unless you have only bought drugstore brands. But this does not compare to the higher known make up brands at all. Back to Sephora I go to purchase STILA for $20 bucks, what a waste of money this was.
B000O7PKZY|5|I lap swim 1-2 times per week. Regular shampoo made my hair tangled and it was starting to feel dry from all the chlorine. I wanted a &#34;clean&#34; shampoo (in terms of ingredients) that would help treat my hair after swimming, and I came across this shampoo. I absolutely love it- it smells awesome, I appreciate the ingredients, and it definitely makes my hair feel nourished after swimming!
B001W2K51O|5|Excellent product - excellent service!
B00HT6E2JI|5|I received this razor as a part of a BzzCampaign to try and then review.  I absolutely LOVE it!  It gives me a nice close, shave with no razor bumps or redness.  I have sensitive skin so that is important to me.  I also like how it has its own moisturizer so that if you don't have enough shaving cream in one spot you don't have to worry!
B00H3MATM2|2|Feels great, but the handle snaps too easily under use. I've purchased two from bed bath beyond, and both snapped in the same place.
B002N5MKMG|5|This is an amazing line of products.  The product not only works very well, it does exactly what it claims, and the scent is sooooo nice.
B00H7Q05H8|1|Sucked. Didnt even work at all. I had to purchase another one. But i guess u get what u paid for it.
B003G5A60A|5|Very pleased with the product. I will recommended to anyone thank you very much. I will be glad to buy it again
B001T8W4BK|1|Did not come with ring shown in picture, that is the only reason I ordered it. picture is not accurate
B00CD2922A|5|Excellent tool to have on hand to remove in between teeth food particles. Different sizes available as well.
B00008CMPY|5|nice
B003C54M9A|4|Sometimes a mouse comes in the house through doors left open and I bought this in case the one I last saw might find his surroundings less hospitable than the neighbors as a choice.  :-)  I haven't seen any droppings or food disturbance so I can only guess that it works ok.
B00TY418J0|5|These are beautiful body pads that one can use on both face and body.  It is perfect for oily and combination oily skin (on the face) because pads are soaked with salicylic acid that prevents acne and helps control oil production.  I must say that this product is useful for both men and women.  I do have another secret on how to use this product on the body.  It is perfect after bikini / brazilian waxing (shaving).  After waxing, it helps going over the skin with this pad because it will help prevent creation of the ingrown hairs.  I know some friends who have been using Image cleansing pads that are soaked with the same ingredients as these.  This product is much more affordable and it gives the same results.<br /><br />Someone was asking what is the percentage of salicylic acid in the product.  It is 2% in case you are curious.
B000GHWTPQ|5|Gift for my Sweetheart &#60;3  Always a big win.  Will purchase thru Amazon again -- don't have to drive to the store and wait in line...... ships to my door.
B00DUG2QPS|2|How does one access the oil as it is solid and in a long 12 oz bottle with a very narrow opening?
B00KI3Z2UW|5|Rose Hip Seed Oil is pretty miraculous stuff, if you get right down to it.  It cures a lot of ailments and is an effective remedy for aging skin and also for acne and acne scars.  I even use it on burns and insect bites and on my sunburn this summer too.  It's gentle enough that I have put it on my grandchildren for bites and sunburns too.  It's organic and has no chemicals in it so it's safe for all.  I could talk about this great stuff all day long!
B002IT3KD0|5|I use this as a deep conditioner on my hair, my daughters, and my extensions. I am not a big fan of the smell (smells like a salon), but I love the way it works. Leaves hair soft and moisturizes, a perfect product for girls with 4C curls
B000G3LSPC|5|It easy and very functional, you can choice diferent sizes. It makes you look gorgeous!<br /><br />My only complaint is because of they changed the brush, and the new one it´s softer, so the finished is not equal than before.
B008U12YV4|1|Just got the product today. Zippers did not work well at all, they keep getting hung up.  The stiching on one of the pockets was loose.  Not high quality, may just thow it away.
B000CQYM4W|5|I love it!
B003QJ7TFG|5|My favorite spring color!!! Its a little more orange than pictured...definitely on the coral side. LOVE IT so much! :)
B000O01CJO|4|It's a great brush, especially for people with thinner hair.
B0048IGBD0|2|What is it supposed to fix?  I haven't noticed a difference, except gums bleed occasionally (not enough to be alarmed).
B00FEJ7P78|5|Good size mirror with handle for convenient.
B005GD1EP6|5|Am sold on this product.  Never used waterpic before, but I am very pleased with the product and each tip has its own function.  I am a clean nut and this product meet my expectations.
B0071H61FS|5|I've been using this for 4 months and helps me greatly!<br /><br />I live in Hawaii and didn't expect it to help me lighten at all, but it had!<br /><br />In a month, I got 2 shades lighter on my arms. I LOVE THIS.
B0018J0UOI|5|I received this as a gift years ago and I make sure I never run out! It's awesome. I use it on my feet and it really helps in between pedicures.
B003339APW|1|I have been using this product for 4 weeks now. i'm rating it a 1..because  this product has done nothing in doing what it was suppose to do. which is  make lashes longer,thicker,and fuller. i really wanted this product to work   for me. so i don't think i will be placing another order for it.
B0062ACZ0A|5|Wonderful skin care lotion.
B008HRMO34|5|The shampoo makes my hair Smell really nice and smooth
B00KMW5BPA|5|excellent
B000C213XO|5|It diffuses a very mild light perfume, just what I wanted. I wear Shalimar lotion and perfume so I wanted a nice hint on days I do not want to wear the stronger lotions and perfumes. I will be purchasing it again.
B005SJ0MYC|5|Bought as a gift and she went bananas!! Color is a vibrant, jewel tone and is the fabulous OPI quality that it stands for. I wish I had bought her the entire Muppets collection!!
B002ZNJI8U|4|when considering buying one of these products just be sure that this is what you want and you have checked everywhere else before purchasing online.
B00ATS24EI|5|Love this stuff so much for myself that I'm giving it for christmas gifts this year!  Going to get all my friends hooked. :)
B00E9PPGTC|4|I've been a Colgate user since I was old enough to brush my teeth, so I am always trying new Colgate products whenever offered. Since I am &#34;of an age&#34; to need a product for sensitive teeth, this was a fortuitous offering. My observations: my teeth do feel better after using this toothpaste. I'm not certain if the &#34;smartfoam&#34; has anything to do with it. The taste is not as good as the Colgate gel flavors, but it is not a bad taste, either, and doesn't have that &#34;baking soda&#34; aftertaste that some other whitening toothpastes do. If you're interested in my husband's opinion, he says it is &#34;OK,&#34; but he prefers &#34;gel&#34; to what he calls &#34;mud.&#34; I don't mind brushing with white paste myself.
B001E5ECC2|1|This review is for the Natural Instincts 36 Midnight Black color.  The color turns out darker than what the model is wearing on the cover, but that's exactly what I wanted so I'm pleased. It is dark but still a natural looking black because there is no blue, red, purple, or any other unnatural colored sheen to it. It doesn't have an overwhelming smell. I love the conditioner it comes with.  I left mine on for 15 minutes because I wasn't sure that I trusted that it would work in 10 minutes. I also wore an insulating cap on my  head while the color set. I washed it out with cold water.  I just dyed it now, so I don't have anything to say about how long it lasts or what it looks like when it washes out.  ---------EDIT---------- It's been several months since I've died my hair with this dye and I really wish I hadn't. It. will. not. wash. out. Do not use this if you like to change up your hair color because it is stuck, permanently for me. I tried using a hair stripper, the vitamin C method, repeatedly washing with clarifying shampoo....Nothing will budge this dye. Plus I think it damaged my hair. The part that I put the dye on (at the time it was only applied to my roots) feels rougher and doesn't shine like the rest of my hair.
B00LXIQDPO|4|The eRase e60 worked well on my lower legs. The upper lip not so much. It worked on my upper lip hair, but the pain was bad and I couldn't stop sneezing. My upper lip skin is too sensitive for the eRase e60 I now have a rash on my upper lip. My legs and underarms are great though! Very little hair breakage though.
B0020Z31S6|2|This left a white pasty film on my skin and looked as if I was wearing heavy makeup on my face.
B000068PBT|5|Fast shipping, perfect fit, works great. Replace heads once a year to keep a close shave!  What else can you say!?
B002T3V294|4|This I thought was a bad purchase, I was wrong it is very nice and my daughter loves it, so I guess Mama did good. Got here on time and I would buy from seller again.
B0061WEMFU|5|Great quality at a reasonable price.
B001E8IAF4|5|The only thing I can say is IT WORKED.
B00KGO8XY0|5|Great quality! Came in a nice box. Love it!
B00DA5819Y|5|We got an extra one beyond the 2 it was supposed to come with. They are very sturdy and look great though. Worth the price even without the extra one. No way to change the size though and it is pretty small.
B001I82I12|4|These are a little thinner and flimsier than I would like, but since there's 6 pairs maybe I could glue a couple together to make them stronger.
B00BDRANVU|3|It's a decent shampoo. Haven't noticed any hair loss help, but makes my hair grow faster. I don't know if it's worth the price in the long run, but it could be worth a try for someone who has never used it.
B00DPTW8JY|5|Beautiful and easy to use.
B00ARTK9FA|3|Lot of noise and vibration compared to another popular brand Sonicare.  Surprised that there is no cover for the toothbrush head.
B004NCFOZM|5|I bought this moisturizer and did not have very high expectations as my skin is definitely in the \\"fussy\\" category. However, I read the multitude of positive reviews and comments and wanted to give it a try. I try a LOT of different things for my skin and rarely can find the right product for my complicated issues. My skin is dry, sensitive and I have rosacea on my chin and nose. Well, I am completely impressed with this product. It is soothing, moisturizing and it does not exacerbate my skin redness or cause break outs. I simply love it! Makes my skin feel great. It is great for daytime under makeup and for night time as well. The scent is very nice, slightly floral. I will definitely be purchasing another tube.
B000HA75EC|5|I ordered this to replace my old, battery operated Wahl trimmer. Other than the batteries, it was great for many years of use, so I knew to buy a Wahl trimmer again. Only this time, a rechargeable version.<br /><br />I could not be more satisfied in the product. I use it for face, body and even to trim my hair. For me, it's a perfect small, rechargeable timmer.<br /><br />Most buyers would want to get a trimmer guide comb for it. Since I already had one from my old Wahl, I didn't need another trimmer guide comb.
B000Q52UGG|5|At first when i got this item i thought that it would be easy to use because i had first seen it at vegas but it cost to much so i didnt purchase it, when i got it i had a very hard time to stamp my nails after trying it for at least 2 weeks i got the hang of it and i was able to get the hang of it. all you need is practice dont give up because i was going to give up myself but it takes patience. i really recommend it!
B003V264WW|5|exelente
B004DBXKM2|5|My daughters have very curly hair and they give me a very hard time when combing their hair every morning... When I used this product I was very pleased it made combing their hair much easier and they were very happy with the great smell.
B0047F71SS|5|Good cream
B009RNUH4A|5|I received Vaseline spray and go complementary from influenster and I am sooooo impressed with it.  It sprays on like a spray sunscreen, rub it in, and it dries soooo fast.  I will most definitely buy this product as my future lotions.  PLUS, the price is great.  This will be replacing my bath and body works lotion.  Non greasy and quick!  Win!
B003JN6E5U|5|this works great for any piercing that you need to clean. i have my lip pierced and i use it clean it and it works fine..
B002WTC384|5|I reorder a new one
B00OI4ANG0|5|I've been using this product for a while for my thinning hair as I age. When I hit menopause, my hair thinned considerably and I needed to do something. Hair products in the stores were not helping my predicament. I've noticed growth coming in that is stronger - not as thin as my other hair, and will continue to use this for a few months. Nothing dramatic has happened, but definitely seems to strengthen my hair follicles and bring back hair to areas that had thinned.
B00OGNF62E|5|Wonderful !  Hoping it does the trick of fading my dark spots......
B000FGM6G0|5|This lip gloss smells good, goes on slick and stays on a long time. Great value for the price. I love Philosophy products. They're all great!
B005OU4J6C|4|is the first time.. that i used a BB cream Asian... its increible.. fabuluos you face.. is perfect... than girl asian.. i dont know..how are the Garnier BB cream..and Loreal..but this is amazing!! the sales was very fast... the product is original.. tnks.. i hope will buy another thing..! tnks :). the bad was the samples... i would like normal bb misha..but was one sample.. strange... :(
B003CZ81NI|4|Acceptable quality for the price. Ideal for travelling.
B00H7Z2HAW|5|I purchased this for my husband so he can use the shaving soap I make. This scuttle is very attractive and easy to use after looking at the u-Tube video that shows step by step. He loves it!
B001CJJ5QS|4|Love it!
B00176GT60|5|works great!
B00BDTFN2M|3|I purchased the collection because I wanted smaller, varied colors of the OPI liquid sand polishes.  When I used my original version, the polish stayed on a full week without a problem.  I had problems with chipping (while I was sleeping) with the one I used from this pack.  I don't know why there would be a difference, but I was disappointed.  Also note that the fourth color is not black (it looks black to me) but the color is still very pretty.<br /><br />In a nutshell, pretty colors but doesn't seem to be as durable as the full size liquid sands.
B00HA7S9CW|5|I love this product.  I use this for my diabetic legs that are really bad with sores. I use it even for other things such as my pets with hot spots. This is truly a miracle product .I recommended this to everyone. Thank you. Linda Turner
B007Z8ZQAE|5|I love this product. In the store they sell for $17 each.. This sent adapts to your natural sent; enhancing it just a tad...  GUYS love it.. I was introduced to this when i use to bar tend. It's a tip magnate. Will order again when BEFORE i run out.
B005LN60UK|3|I love vanilla so I said what the heck I will try this product this one is okay but something is different about it so in the end I gave it to my friend.
B00AHF1GTM|5|I will never use another shaver as long as this one is being manufactured. It's like silk on my legs.
B00DWDHSJ8|5|Theses lashes are def what they say they are, i had a amazon gift card for my bday..decided to rack up on lashes. i will be purchasing all my lashes from Cherishlook! they def are comparable to ardell..if not better! i mean the price is right, isn't it? love these lashes.<br /><br />-Lancome MUA/Counter Manager
B0073PRS6O|4|This color is the perfect  Latina-living-in-Miami-Tan. Better than any other self tanner out there, from drugstore or high end dept. store. Authentic color, no smell, no fuss. Seriously. Wipe yourself tanned. Wash your hands. You are done.That simple.
B001BBNS7E|5|Best Floss, hands down.  Organic silk floss...  I mean come on.  Now it may not be as smooth and strong as other petroleum based flosses, but it is still a superior product with a natural origin.
B006K9OQSC|5|I bought this product to curl my hair without heat and it works perfectly!<br />I love it! My hair is way too thick to make a bun with it but that's alright.
B0011Z3WU8|5|After trying many other shampoos for my 15 year old son with flaky dry scalp (so embarrassing!) I found this one. It works great! Flakiness has cleared up and even though he showers every day because of his sports, there is no irritation from the shampoo. I recommend it highly.
B003YMJJSK|5|Love this stuff! Haven't had 1 breakout since I've been using it for over a month.
B00GGLKVEM|5|very effective.
B0020ZEA40|4|This is one of my favorite BB creams to date. This BB cream can be intimidating to some people, but this particular one is great for anyone, especially for new BB cream users. This one looks particularly gray, but like every BB cream, it will adjust. I have read a lot of reviews about how the color adjusts after an hour, but those people are tripping. I timed it, and it adjusts WITHIN 15 minutes. This cream has a lovely light floral scent. It feels very light and offers a light to medium coverage, whereas usually BB creams offer medium to heavy coverage. This one doesn't really have great buildable coverage like typical foundations and other BB creams - it'll look like you're wearing a gray mask if you attempt a second application. If you're afraid of the gray tone or find this BB cream too light even after waiting for it to adjust, mix in a dab of foundation or concealer that is a shade or two darker than your own. I use NC25 in MAC, Bisque in Laura Mercier (tinted moisturizer), Golden Medium in Bare Escentuals, and L3 in Smashbox, I40 in Shiseido, and Ivory in Hourglass (tinted moisturizer) and this BB cream is slightly lighter for me during the summer. I definitely do not recommend this one for anyone with oily skin, because even on my combination skin my face sometimes feels oily after a long day. No matter your skin type, always use moisturizer before you apply BB cream. Overall, this is a nice BB cream, most fit for BB cream newbies.
B00E5WLBTS|4|Feels good
B0093IQWPW|5|The SK-II company uses only the highest quality ingredients which is reflected in the price tag of their product line.  The SK-II Essential Power Moisturizing Cream, 2.71 fl. oz. sells for $215.00 at Amazon and Sephora.  So getting to try this tiny sample of the cream was really important for me before I would commit to purchasing such an expensive product.  The little jar holds a bit less than .05 oz of the cream but with this product a little goes a long way. I have really oily skin and suffer from break outs and wrinkles (what a combo) so I was a little bit afraid that the cream would break me out.  I used a pea size amount on the drier parts of my skin to see if I would break out.  I am happy to say that the cream did not break me out.  I was also surprised at how smooth the texture of the cream is. It spread out so easily so a little really went a long way.  I got about three weeks worth of use out of this little jar. That was enough time to get a good idea of its effectiveness for my skin.<br /><br />The cream is great and really moisturized my skin.  I found it a bit too heavy to use during the day since it has been really warm out here this summer.  I decided to use it only at night and got some great results.  I think this cream will be wonderful during the winter when my skin tends to be drier.<br /><br />According to the BzzAgent website the &#34; SK-II Essential Power Cream contains Stem-Acanax and Pitera™ to radically improve firmness and reduce wrinkles&#34;.  This miracle ingredient is at the core of the revolutionary products SK-II offers. SK-II Facial Treatment Essence is a liquid concentrate with 90% Pitera™ in every bottle. SK-II Facial Treatment Masks deliver an indulgent concentration of Pitera™ in a single application. Your future isn’t limited by your DNA. With the right regimen, you can change your skin’s destiny.<br /><br />The Pitera compound stimulates the skins natural cellular repair and promotes more efficient skin regeneration.  For those who do not know, Pitera is a type of fermented yeast that is supposed to speed up the skins rejuvenation process.  The yeast come from Saki.<br /><br />Overall, the price of these products may appear to be on the high side.  However, if you consider how well they work and how little of the product you use at each application, then the price is actually pretty reasonable.<br /><br />Thank you to BzzAgent and SK II for providing me with samples of these products to test out and give my honest review of my personal experience with the SK-II Facial Product line.

B001MA0QY2|5|This product definitely meets my expectations. After reading all the reviews I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I get compliments of my hair all the time..curls, waves, straight, flipped in/out you name it! With the HSI straightener a great hair day is at your fingertips!!😃
B00IALDHDI|5|I received this free from Influenster and I really like it! My eye lashes went KAPOW... My lashes look huge, long and full when using Bombshell mascara! I definitely recommend!
B002KPHFTC|5|Ame este producto, el color es simplemente perfecto lo recomiendo 100% Gracias - Love this product, the color is just perfect I recommend 100% Thanks
B00836KRZQ|2|I bought this about a month ago thinking that I could do my own nails before work in the mornings and have them dry in 40 seconds. The problem is that I can't get the timer to work at all. It will eventually dry your nails but just have to have patience. I got what I paid for.
B00IMHN0B4|4|I love your Rose Water. Feels nice on my face and the hint of rose fragrance is uplifting as I use it. I have sensitive skin and this is very calming. Does not leave red splotches all over my face. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that, in my opinion, it should come in a pump or spray bottle.
B0014ZWHZ6|3|I like that it diminishes my black circle under the eye. It gives a nice refresh look to my eyes specially in the morning.
B000QTD3FY|5|This product from American Crew works really well for women, too, who have thin short hair.  The body the product provides is perfect.  I put a dollop, about the size of a dime, on towel dried wet hair; rub it in and style with a pic comb. Then let my hair dry, run a brush through it and use some gel for spikes.  Cute hairdo when you have fine thinning hair (having a great hair stylist helps.)  Great product!
B000W15EOY|5|The recipient visited the H2O+ store in New York and fell in love with the product.  The scent is delicious and the product leaves her skin soft and smooth.
B000K6SPRY|5|this is good for bedbound patients. in two days it helped to heal very bad pressure ulcer. this is a miracle cream.
B007JMVK56|5|I only use like to use this about once every month or two as that’s how much it helps me feel and look.
B00FBPE52I|4|You get a good dry shave, but I got a better shave in the shower using the electric shave gel that came with it.  No travel pouch, which was a little disappointing.
B001F51VS4|4|this product does work. but there are some rules you have to do for it to work. You can't use it after you shower, use it at bed time, can't use it after shaving. And if there are any people out there that are like me. I put deodorant after I shower at night. It does keep you dry if you use the product with the rules
B00462OE3M|3|Ok
B00I3VHKVK|4|soft & smooth, this value is a +
B00FAVBKX0|5|I thought they were very cheap at first but then after snapping it in place to my clear sonic brush it worked great! I am only get my replacement heads online from now on.
B000EVEL2S|1|Received this product on time, however, it was not the product noted in this picture.  The product I received did not have the noted &#34;Oil Moisture Creme&#34; on the packaging.  I received a bottle of just plain neutralizing shampoo.  Conferred back and forth with seller and ended up getting a refund because it was not the product noted in the picture.
B000TGEUHY|5|Love it!  My favorite lip product that I use daily--365 days a  year.  This color is my &#34;go to&#34; color!
B002L3QZO4|5|I got a jar of this to get rid of some persistent warts on my daughter's elbow.  The biggest of these had been frozen off, burned off, lazered and treated with acid solutions over the course of 5 years, umpteen (expensive) visits to multiple dermatologists, etc.  The main wart not only survived these treatments, but got continuously larger - to the point where my daughter was quite self-conscious.<br /><br />After reading of the alleged benefits of neem, I thought &#34;what the heck - it's not like neem can make this any worse.&#34;  Opening the bottle, I had some second thoughts.  First off, the neem wasn't really a liquid - it was fairly solid.  I cured that by running the bottle under some hot water for a minute or so - no problems there.  Secondly, neem oil stinks - I mean it really is putrid.  My daughter doesn't object to it, but boy, I can't stand the smell.<br /><br />Anyway, I applied this to the 2 warts on her arm.  Within a week, the smaller wart was entirely gone, and the bigger one was shrinking fast.  Now we've been treating it 2x/day for a month, and the &#34;Large&#34; wart is almost gone - it's slightly raised, but it's certainly not visible to the casual observer.  And my daughter is much, much happier.<br /><br />I have read any number of accounts of miracle cures by various natural remedies, but in this case, I'll swear by Neem Oil, particularly the Alaffia neem oil.
B002WKRJ0K|5|So, lots of controversy on `pheromones' and how well they work or don't work. I strongly believe this is because of an over-expectation of what people think they will do. It is not some golden bullet to get you laid nor does it magically make women just fall into your lap. If you're hoping for that kinda thing, well, that sucks because such a thing just doesn't exist.<br /><br />However, what this can do is give you a definite (even if placebo) boost of confidence as well as moderate effects from the pheromones will indeed make women more receptive to you. This is not some dramatic effect that the advertising would like you to believe BUT if you are looking and watching closely you WILL notice a difference!<br /><br />A lot of people also seem to neglect the cologne side of this too! This stuff smells fantastic! Even if the `pheromones' do nothing for you, the scent itself is still a wonderful scent worth the money. I've gotten a lot of positive feedback on that part of it for sure. It lasts alot longer than any other cologne I've used, especially on clothing but its not an overwhelming or annoyingly powerful smell either if you use the right amount. (About 3\\" strip on the neck and wrists works well for me).<br /><br />Also, the roll-on applicator is awesome. I like this about a million times better than just a standard spray bottle. Much easier to get a \\"good\\" amount on you. Plus you end up using less than you would with a spray, but its still a GOOD amount. So even tho the bottle is somewhat small-ish this thing is going to last you a good amount of time even if you used it daily.<br /><br />Honestly don't have anything truly negative to say about it other than it's a tad pricy upfront (worth it b/c it lasts) and the logo on the bottle (both old and new designs) needs a serious overhaul lol. Its kinda tacky imo but w/e.<br /><br />OTHER THOUGHTS<br />Its hard to drop the $$ not knowing for sure what its going to smell like. Would be nice if Alchemy Labs offered a cheap \\"sample pack\\" of their product line to tryout before dropping this much one one of them. While I'm glad I did take the risk end up getting this, I would bet a lot of people probably pass by it because of that.cheap \\"sample pack\\" of their product line to tryout before dropping this much one one of them.

B00454UF70|3|The product is good,  I am apparently allergic...it gave me a headache. I am giving it away to someone who can appreciate the smell.
B00IPZZ9BM|5|Good sheet
B0009OAGNI|1|This smelled like BUG SPRAY on me after about 20 minutes. The drydown left some stinky, offensive strong notes that made my throat sore to breathe them in.<br />It's hard to just put a little on, even one spray is very overwhelming. What's so sad is that I have smelled this on other people and liked it (other than the full frontal nasal assault it causes me). Not a long wearing product either.
B00JJK3MU2|1|It wasn't that much rhassoul I expected more then I received!?
B00HBYNGOA|5|Smell great and light perfect. Thank You
B00B1DQYG4|5|Looks so good even my hair stylist said it is the perfect color for me. It looks natural.
B001JPH44K|1|I ordered this because I read that it was great for KP but it's not.  It's the same powder I bought at the big box store and i paid 4 bucks for their generic brand. If you have KP i recommend Neutrogena's coal tar shampoo.  It smoothed out everything!
B002KFBAFW|2|smells amazing, but feels like I have plastic all over my skin after.
B001B0TJCI|4|This item is a bit bulky, and certainly not a pretty addition to your bathroom, but it really does give me an \\"extra hand\\" when styling my hair. I like that I can either use two hands for styling, or set the dryer on a low, diffused setting to dry my hair while I'm putting on make-up. I've also used it in the laundry room for drying my dog after her bath, so that I can have both hands available. It's easy to put up and take down to move from room to room for that purpose. Note: It MUST be attached to a non-porous surface such as a mirror (or the top of the washer or dryer in the case of the dog-drying). The large suction-cup base will not stay attached to a cabinet or wall. I do wish there was an option for attaching it permanently; I would consider ordering a second one so that I didn't have to move it.
B0050HO9MI|1|very short handle, way shorter than an average razor. hubby has big hands so this was not great. also he was scared to use it in fear of cutting himself. it did not cut like a regular razor he told me.
B00157YWYC|5|Love miracle2 products. The gel can be used for itching areas, anything irritable on the skin. Can be taken internnaly, my dog loves it after I put it on an irritated spot.
B00GP440S8|5|Very Nice Gloss palette, especially the red one!<br />Colors blend with your natural lip color so reds look really nice without being too flashy!<br />Holds a long time!<br />Box has a brush inside with a little mirror!<br />Quality is super for the price.
B009VMR894|5|Great product. Excellent price
B000JR6X96|4|I have enjoyed this fragrance for many years as did the ladies in my life. I stopped using it a while back just to make a change. I recently purchased it again at considerable expense. All though the fragrance is the same, the lasting effect is not. Previous use lasted ALL day. This time it only lasts 2-3 hours. This is not acceptable considering the cost. As a result I probably would not purchase again.
B003X49E20|5|Some of the very best moisturizer I have ever used. Intense and gentle!
B000OZI8HS|5|As a medical professional I can tell you there is nothing that will really prevent stretch marks from occurring. They are genetic, and some people are just luckier than others. That being said, keeping your skin moisturized DOES help your skin feel better while it is stretching and growing. This cream had a pleasant smell, and no greasy after-feeling at all. It kept the itchies away and I used it probably from month 4-9 of my pregnancy. I didn't get any stretch marks until the last week, where I got a few. I have used it a bit afterward and they have mostly faded (I'm 4 mos postpartum). It's not a miracle cream, there just isn't one out there because it's not possible. However, it's a nice indulgence and it hydrates well with great ingredients.
B009DCX576|1|It makes a mess...too much glitter.
B00G6POFIQ|4|Not a bad lotion. I tried to mix it up and try something new. Did not get me as dark as the Black Elixir but still a fine lotion.
B004VJ56AK|5|I love, love, love it!  What more can you say?  It has done so much for me already, that I cannot imagine what my skin will look like after using it a few more months.  I have only been using it for about three weeks and can already see the difference!  Get product and great price for the results you see!  Would recommend to everyone.
B0000DK5LW|5|Oh my goodness. I love it. You could not find anything better. The price is good. It really truly works
B001LYAQSU|2|Not leather, looks very cheap but it will do for now
B003UNP20W|4|I like how soft the brushes are. Just received them in mail today. The quality of the brushes are great!
B001ACCZ5K|5|As an adult, I love love love this product. I have recommended it many times and anyone I have told about it, loved it too !<br />Works very well and works overnight.
B00D6EDGZI|4|I've been using this product for about a week now and I have to say that I genuinely like it. It provides a light, luminous coverage which I like since I hate having a heavy, greasy cream on my face. The shade looks dark when it comes out of the tube but applies evenly and blends in with your skin. It actually evens out my skin tone too (which is normally splotchy). I haven't noticed that my dark spots have exactly faded but I haven't really been using it long enough to tell if it is having any effect. The fact that it also contains UVA/UVB SPF 15 sunscreen is a great plus. Overall I think it's a pretty good BB cream compared to others that I have tried before.
B00JJ296GE|1|I only received one bottle, I thought it was a 2pk???? Very disappointed!!!
B00L4FQVB2|3|The shampoo itself works just fine. It cleans the scalp, but does not strip it from all it's natural oils. My only issue with this shampoo is the strong scent it has. It does not leave a strong smell after use (which is ok). But when you first open the bottle it has an overwhelming scent (not a huge fan of that).
B001E7BCDM|2|My daughter suffers from eczema. I purchase this lotion thinking it would be a great addition to the pure goat milk soap I bathe my daughter with. The company that makes the soap doesn't make lotion , so I search cross the internet and after reading good reviews about this I decided to buy it from Whole Foods. Canus has way too many chemicals. They need to stop advertising this as Goat's Milk lotion because the goat milk isn't the main ingredient. Not all natural, not pure.  It should be called Canus Moisturizing Lotion with Goat's Milk and Preservatives.
B000X21996|5|I purchased the Invacare Value Rollator for a patient of mine.  The walker was everything that said to be and more. Amazon shipped supper fast!
B00K6NPKV0|4|I see a great difference in my face. Smoother and less noticeable scars.
B0054Y0RC8|5|I like this hair spray.  It is light & you can still work with your hair after using ig
B00212TYXE|1|I am using it because I paid for it other wise it don't have any smell/fragrance.It does'nt look like geniun or it is too old.
B000EGIEOE|5|Clubman Woltra Styptic Pencils is a very good Product & I will Recommended To Everyone I Know, And have them do the Same
B00006BSXN|1|The dental mold is too thick, so that as you scuplt it between your teeth during forming the overflow runs way up around your teeth. My final product now holds my lips open as I sleep, very uncomforable and unattractive. I'm online now looking for a better product from a competitor.
B005UKT9LG|5|I got this product and yes this is a great one! I used it occasionally and I can recommend this to you!
B001GS6OB4|5|For several years, I have been unable to shave my legs properly because of arthritis.  Trying to shave in the shower was especially difficult due to back pain when bending over.  My shower has no seat and I hate the mess and inconvenience of using a shower chair.<br /><br />Getting lightheaded bending over in the shower was also a problem and danger for me..  Upon receiving this epilator, I was able to &#34;shave&#34; my legs completely in about thirty minutes while sitting in a comfortable, safe chair.  It was virtually painless, just a little stinging.<br /><br />This epilator seems to be well built and is very easy to use.  It is noisy, as others have mentioned, but that is not at all an issue for me.<br /><br />It is very exciting to know that my legs are virtually hair free and that I no longer need to be embarrassed due to poor shaving.
B004M7WKKK|4|This palette is a great beginner's set. You will need to use your fingers to warm the product up. Some may complain about the product being a little cakey, but it is still a great set.
B004BDAF02|5|Love it and the smell. My only concern is the aluminum, but it is less aluminum then the previous brand I used to use. Just makes me nervous.
B001OC89ME|5|Great stuff, fast delivery
B00LDIZLK2|5|It is great products
B00C1F3D10|2|Not what I wanted. I have bought an X&Y Angel wig before, and what I received was DEFINITELY not an X&Y Angel wig. It was made very cheaply, almost as cheap as a Halloween wig. It did not have the tag for X&Y Angel. The wig barely fit. As it says in the description, it is better to buy directly from their site other than amazon because it is not reputable. Listen to it and use caution when buying. Also, make sure it has the tag before wearing and is the correct wig, and if it is not, you can return it as long as it has not been worn.
B00GJYMRUC|4|This product  left my skin feeling  plump and youthful looking. I would cleanse my face, then apply this serum and then  went about with my moisturizer  and makeup. It didn't disturb my makeup which is one of my concerns  as I am a makeup artist. This was also gentle  on my sensitive  skin  I did receive  this item for free for review purposes but my opinion  is 100% true and unbiased
B005I2MP62|5|It was great this time, it seems the last ones were all dried out...so frustrating.  These are fine.  Thank you very much. My delivery for September is NOT necessary. Sealed. Sweet.
B0080L9FUM|4|The ingredients are just what I was looking for especially no carrageenan however the taste is tolerable but just ok . I will probably try another brand when this runs out.
B00766RKSG|5|I purchased these to keep in my purse. I'm horrible about remembering to tweeze my eyebrows but always seem to see a stray hair at the worst times. Now I always have a small pair of tweezers in my purse to grab that hair that is driving me nuts whenever I need to.
B00PMQAWK0|1|Very very cheap feeling and looking...but even worse the bbutton is WAY to big for the loop. I'm gonna have to change buttons!
B00WBW82BY|5|Item was received exactly as described.
B00O14BHP8|5|Just what I expected and arrived promptly. Only tanning product I use.
B0009VQ8J2|5|Very rich and creamy.  Very nice cream.
B00C179E0C|3|this hair is really nice..i own about ten different kinds of hair exstentions and these are very nice i love them..i would buy from these people agian
B0046KG8DS|4|I have been using these for a while and my hair looks very healthy, it hasn't grown too much but it's ok
B000XEAZ9Y|1|This product was fake.  After couple of uses the too started leaking and eventually fell off. The owner wanted to send it back with original packing wjich I had already discarded.
B0007KX8FW|5|Arrived quickly & handles well while curling.

B001EJOPWU|5|I use Clinique face soap with my Buf-Puf every day.  I love how it gently exfoliates my face without making me red.  I use it every day.
B008YDXM28|4|Big fan of the Taylor brand products.  The aroma is nice but I prefer the sandalwood.  This cream seemed a bit thicker than the last batch I got of another scent but builds a nice lather.  I've got hard water and creams don't seem to be as picky as soaps when it comes to water quality.  I've also tried it with distilled water and it does create a much richer and sustainable lather than with the tap water.  Overall this is a great product that provides nice cushion and a slick layer for your razor to glide over.
B001U6B188|2|I have been using Nantucket Briar for years.  I don't live near a store, so it is sometimes a while between purchases.  My store went out, so I ordered here.  But the smell if this, while being similar, is different.  When you first dispense it quite alcohol smelling.  If this is a change in formula as others have said, it's not a good one.
B005SI0OOG|5|It fits my Gunnars well and I haven't had a problem with it. Durable and fashionable. It also has a magnetic clasp that keeps the case shut.
B003ZBL820|5|Great Buy !
B00V6069QM|5|Excellent Conditioner.....Hair was so soft and shiny..nothing like it..
B00LPYKFFA|5|I really really love this stuff! I only wish it were available in other shades, like coral. Finally there is a lipstick and lip liner I can totally trust. I think there is no excuse any more for all the toxins in cosmetics. Lead can lead to dementia-- a price not worth beauty!<br /><br />Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor and Beyond Broccoli
B006VT0M1G|5|It exceeded my expectations!  Surpassed more expensive facial creams.
B001DNE3KQ|5|The razor gives a close shave without irritating the skin.  I like the notice the razor gives when it needs to be cleaned.
B00AEVP8QG|5|I got one of these from my Dentist as a parting gift.  I find it indispensable! I use floss after every meal and this is the perfect way to have it with me at all times. The dispenser is shaped like a credit card so it fits perfectly into any wallet or takes up no space in a little purse.  :D
B005D2VPQI|5|ive always loved this scent when found on amazon at such a great price,i WAS IN LOVE .im glad i purchased stays on my hands forever and absolutely love the bottle..shipped quickly and yes leaves hands very soft
B003N1YRWA|1|I just used for the first time I thought this would be a gel what came out was more a clear oil type of consistency. I have yet to see if it will brown my legs I am waiting on that
B003D7L7OA|5|I love this deodorant, it's really smell (everybody likes) and it is very durable, it's one of the most cheap and good deodorant on the market. I recomend for who doesn't know it.
B006GQYSGO|5|If they still have it when my husbands and if my husbands finally wears his out.  He likes it a lot.
B002CSPKSU|5|I've tried so many products for my face, including Proactiv, and none have worked as well as Exposed Skin Care. Each of the bottles and tubes that come in the kits works together to make your face clearer. I love Exposed, my acne has reduced and I have no black heads. When I'm on my period, that's when my acne is the worst, it still is great on my face. Its soft and gentle as well.
B0006FIDP8|3|A little stronger than I remembered it to be. Just a little bit goes a long way.
B000300UZM|4|This works well but would be a bit better if the fit could be tighter and if it got colder.  Great idea, need a bit more refinement to be<br />really effective.
B003XWG880|2|Vanicreme is NOT CRUELTY FREE. Go with a different product/manufacturer like Cetaphyl. Cruelty free means they do not test on animals.
B003D1KV8O|5|I LOVE this conditioner. It is completely worth the price. I wish it smelled better, but even so I complete LOVE it.  Update from 2016: I have purchased this product from my hair dresser and this retailer. Both are exactly the same. My original rinse from this retailer came with a pump. The rinse I bought from my hair dresser didn't. She may have assumed I had one.. I still love this product. When I forget to order more from my salon, they don't carry this large size for purchase, I buy from Amazon. Any other condition just does compare.
B00NXJOHPO|4|It is very good for the hair
B00OND402E|5|Very pigmented and 1 coat can be worn. Very low chemical smell and size is large enough for the salon. Great buy!
B007I01TK0|5|I did not pick this one out, it was one that my girlfriend wanted to get for me. It is a good fragrance and my girlfriend loves to smell it on me so that is a definite plus. I think this one is a hit or miss with most people. I have gotten compliments from other people but then some do not care for it that much. I like it...it is a stronger and bolder fragrance which I think is good for me.
B00P88VPKS|2|FEELS VERY CHEAP.  THE NOZZLE CONSTANTLY FALLS OFF HAD TO TAPE IT.<br />THE CORD IS VERY SHORT!! NOT COMFORTABLE TO HOLD.  WISH I RETURNED IT WHEN I FIRST GOT IT. :(
B008CC3SMK|3|I like the way the product goes on and that it doesn't stain your clothes, but it takes a while to dry and then gets a bit sticky causing any loosening lint from clothing to stick to the area. I wear a lot of darker colored tanks and  noticed the lint sticking to the area in excess. Which I did not like at all.
B00IZR4TOI|3|I liked this drill when I first got it... then the hand drill kept messing up and eventually died. The vibration of the drill was bad and it was very loud.
B002PB7KBO|5|I absolutely love how this makes my skin feel. I had patches of flakey skin during a certain time of the month and as soon as I would use this, it would heal it.
B002O0D8P8|5|Good product.
B003S516XO|5|Best Straightener ever!!!
B002LE8P1Y|5|Just as good as the one that cost me over $100.00.  I plan on purchasing two more for my daughters.
B000WIE3Z8|5|Have to have Lip Balm. This is a a non-petroleum product. Appears that Chapstick is stopping production so I bot a supply before it is all gone.
B001BO0KMC|5|Love it. Use daily. Easy to use.
B005LN60UK|5|It shipped quickly and smells great! It smells sweet, but is not overwhelming. I should have bought the spray instead!
B00DPIUVH6|1|I have used the gel toothpaste for many years. It's been a salvation. Now it's gone and &#34;gentle mint&#34; is here. It literally tastes like vomit. My dry mouth does not salivate with that flavor. And is not a real gel, so it's more irritating too. I have lupus and frequently get sores in my mouth and throat, the gel was the only thing I could use when my mouth gets bad. The gel toothpaste was the only thing on the market like it, PLEASE BRING BACK ORIGINAL GEL FORMULA!
B000UYVNIO|2|I've never tried hair removal before so this was my first time. I'm not a hairy guy but I like to be clean from any hair on my body. I used this product and was disappointed. A razor provides a much closer shave, this thing left a lot of stubble on me. Granted it was only my first try and I might have done something wrong, but from what I see so far, I won't be surprised that this is the best it can do. It's not worth it. Also, the smell it leaves on you after wards...I thought it would go away after a shower, but it stays with you!
B00JDXRAHG|5|Awesome, very smooth black line.  Stays on very well.
B000C214FG|5|I have been searching for this for years and found it on Amazon.  It was my favorite scent years ago.  It smells just like I remember.  Not old or stale.  I love it.
B004VW59DG|5|I bought this for a gift and the person loved it. He tried it out right away and didn't have a negative thing to say. The soaps that are included smell great and was exactly what I was looking for!
B004TMOH0Y|5|Excellent product
B00CS6R5IE|1|I used Victoria Jackson cosmetics when they first came out & I loved all of her cosmetics, especially the survival kit.  I had looked for the Survival Kit & finally found it on Amazon  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The quality of the makeup was subpar and did not look very good after application. The eyeliner & the lip liner were so hard they were unusable & the tip of the lip liner broke off the first time I used it.  I do not recommend this product.
B0095IMNI0|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE!  I originally bought the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser (WP-660) on Prime Day but ended up returning it because it didn't seem to produce enough pressure.  But this one is AWESOME!  I have bonded retainers on top and bottom following having braces and it's tough to clean around them.  This water flosser does the trick!  AND this is my first sonic toothbrush and love it as well!  Having both in one setup is worth the extra money!
B00JDZC4V6|5|Good product for the price. Certainly as good (or better) than glasses costing 3 times as much. I would recommend these glasses to anyone. Very clear at dusk. I should have bought another pair
B00FO9ASMW|1|Poor quality hair.  Color way too red.  Much redder than other brands in same shade.  Cannot be remy quality, my hairdresser and I were both dissatisfied.
B000FEF1V4|5|I got this for my 22 year old boyfriend. He loves it b/c it is small, sleek, and gets the job done. Not having a beard myself :) I had no idea what the heck to get so I just researched a bunch of different ones and this one appeared to be the best for beard trimming.
B000J46LZU|2|I was disappointed with this product, because it leaves a lot of smearing/residue on the glass. I wouldn't even use this for my eyeglasses, much less for my expensive camera lens. The dry micro-fiber cloths, from Zeiss and other manufacturers, work much better.
B00EXW5ZQU|4|I've tried others. This is my favorite. If you don't put too much on, it works great without clumping.
B000C214CO|3|okay
B00AG4PX98|5|Love this non-toxic nail polish!
B00DQG0PJQ|3|It was okay for keeping my skin moisturized but as far as this &#34;youthful glow&#34; that's supposed to come back to my face - NADA, NYET, NOTHING! Overpriced and I will not be repurchasing.
B005UKT9LG|5|This brand of makeup products is wonderful. I have a few mixed palettes and the colors are beautiful and long lasting. You can get bold colors, frosted colors or matte. They are all great.
B00PIEKGAC|4|👍🏼
B00OIVPT08|1|Wearing them caused more pain than not. Not expensive but not worth it
B0071Q5PL0|5|Just as advertised, works for a number of things and parts of the body.
B003F8JI6G|5|Great stuff
B004LCHAM4|5|Only takes a smidge!
B0089S08SY|5|Systane Lub eye drops Ultra vials is surely helping me with my dry eyes.  I use it every morning and night according to the instructions of my eye doctor.
B005CSKFJQ|5|I started using this product after a recommendation from a facial.  I get very flushed b/c I'm half English w/ freckles.  Some how this product smooths out my face and helps from my face getting too red (which I'm not sure how it can do that part).  I receive compliments all the time how I have a \\"glow\\".  Highly recommend for the right person.
B00150LT40|5|This top coat is super shiny and actually does dry super fast. It also lasted a really long time. My wife really likes it.
B000FYVOJC|5|Cuts a lot closer than my old Wahl trimmer, and the tip is rounded so it doesn't scratch. The end of the tip cuts too, just don't press too hard against soft tissue or it will bite.  It doesn't leave cut hair behind.
B004B9MFEK|2|I purchased this unit about 6 weeks ago - to replace my previous Sonicare system.<br />It is basically the same motor, charge time, etc. The BIG difference is the SIZE and quality of the brushhead.<br /><br />The bristles have worn out much sooner than my old Sonic brush head.  After 6 weeks of brushing, it needs replacing!  And WE KNOW how exspensive they are to replace.<br /><br />Not only that, but the brush size is HALF of my previous one. Literally about 1/2 the size.  And I have the old brush to compare them.<br />For $79.00 you would think Sonic could put in an extra brush head, but they don't.<br />It is obvious to me, that to increse sales revenues $$$$ (due to decrese sales) they have SKIMPED on the esstentials.  I would compare other models or brands before I purchased this one. I am taking mine back.  Shame on you Phillip!!!!
B00C1NST7U|4|This stuff is strong.. but it works.. if your hair is fairly straight leave it on for 5 minutes.
B00119TXES|1|Very messy, prefer facial wax strips to this. Dont buy!
B004NGW7E4|5|This is the best thing that ever happened to my teeth. I have tetracycline in my teeth and have always been yellow. I've tried various products and when I visited my dentist to check the option of Lumineers procedure it worked out verrrry expensive and hence as an alternative he suggested me to go for lumibrite until I can afford Lumineers. This has worked like a charm and my teeth is sooo much whiter. I would recommend this to everyone who want whiter teeth.
B007SZCG0C|5|I think I have tried almost every well-known brand of hair growth shampoo. They have all failed me. Ultrax Labs Hair Surge shampoo works great for hair growth. Also, it has prevented my postpartum hair shedding. I definitely recommend this product for anyone, men or women, who are experiencing hair-loss, hair-thinning or for anyone that would just like to grow their hair out. This shampoo is absolutely a winner. A great product for a great price.
B002ESOHDC|5|This blend of Dragons Blood oil is my absolute favorite!  It smells so good, I am a professional psychic medium and burn it in my office all of the time for psychic protection.  Every person that comes into my office comments on how good it smells, I have finally had to buy it in bulk to give out as gifts.
B001MA0QY2|5|Heats up fast like and does a great job.  It is light and is comparable to higher cost irons.
B0000ZHGZ2|5|Thanks
B0072CT92O|5|The stores in my area quit selling this color, so glad I found these. I am very happy :)
B000AUIFCA|5|I love the oral-b professional floss action replacement brush heads. I have subscribe and save, so every 6 months I get it in the mail. Perfect timing!
B001DJ6IRQ|5|Very pleased. Product exactly what I wanted. Good price. Excellent service from seller. Will buy again.
B004YYPK9E|5|This perfume smells Amazing!! I bought some from my local store. It is my favorite. it is definitely worth the cost!
B00PABCT76|5|I had my order within 2 days of placing my order. Fast and reliable. Cream is not greasy like others I have tried in the past. Over all good product and fast shipping.
B00AQ7R08M|5|My order came earlier than expected date.  Very happy about that.  I love this product!  It  makes my skin feel so much better.  I haven't had a day of dryness or tight feeling since I began using it. Other products I have used haven't lasted the whole day. This will be a regular purchase for me.  I hope to try the body cream soon
B003FBQGHW|1|not for sensitive skin. i would not recommend to anyone with sensitive skin, it was irritating as soon as i put it on
B001QX4T7A|5|Glad to find this product on Amazon as Almay is no longer making it. I have very sensitive eyes and this product works well for me. It doesn't stay on all day, but being that it doesn't bother my eyes I am very happy with it and wish Almay would start making it again.
B000Z93VVQ|4|I used to use a different kindof vitamin E oild. I like this one better. Been using for couple of days. The smell is pleasant. I have very dry skin on face, body and scalp. Using it for the whole body. Face feels soft. Can't say if it made any difference is my scalp yet.
B00OBWSBGS|5|I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday. He says it feels nice on his skin and I say that the scent is an aphrodisiac. Will surely continue to purchase this item.
B005BYXMS2|5|The soap is thick, has great lather and the scent is just right. It lingers on your hands and a hints remains for a while.
B000OYFRLO|5|Gives gloss and keeps softness on thin hair, but thickens (alot-- maybe from the sunscreen??) and conditions enough so as to not get that ponytail \\"dent\\" in your hair.  Only thin-haired people can understand this :)
B0077D38UC|5|I have not had to use it yet, so every thing will be ok.<br /><br />Karen
B001A1S3CU|5|Exactly what I needed! Thanks!
B0043TZOPK|2|The lipstick is red and a dark red. The picture shows a lighter color. Maybe I was sent the wrong one. I cannot wear it.
B00TQN6C0Y|4|A good, efficient hair dryer.  It has three heat settings and 2 speed settings to accommodate different hair textures.  My wife uses the medium heat and my daughter who has finer hair uses the lower heat setting.  It comes with two attachments as stated in the description.  We have used the hair concentrator which makes this even more efficient in straightening out hair and taking out the frizzies.<br />  It is lighter than my wife's previous Remington but makes about the same amount of noise.  We cannot completely say that the presence of ceramic has made a significant difference in the efficiency of drying and styling time.  If this is anything like my wife's current Remington, this would last for years.
B004FP9P0M|3|They burn out a lot quicker than the ones I got at the sunday market. A little dissapointed. The auromas are also very pungeant and kind of all similar.
B003BR01DA|4|I had a Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for about 10 years and it was perfect.  I did not want the 1875 turbo dryer, because I have a hard time styling my hair with them.  (Too much force for my short hair)  I was looking for one with with less air turbo.  I found the 1600 and decided to try it. It has less turbo and easier for me to style my hair.  It is light weight and easier to hold.  The only negative thing I found is that the off & on switch is very sensitive and will shut off if I'm not careful in the way I hold the dryer.  That is the reason I only gave it four stars.  The switch should be redesigned so it doesn't shut off so easily.
B00JA9R3UM|5|This Mother's Day has me thinking of this perfume, which was one of my mother's favorites. When I was a child her signature perfume was Je Reviens by Worth, but in later years she loved Keora by Jean Couturier. Many people did not know of this perfume, which added to Keora's cachet (it was not the kind of perfume you smell on everyone, everywhere) along with the beautiful Lalique-designed bottle that it came in back then, and my mother always got tons of compliments and inquiries whenever she wore it. Men adored it on her and women searched for it.
B00H09L558|5|Ok, I do not always right a review, but I am amazed at the difference I have seen on my face after 1 nightly use. I received this on a Sunday, (Kudos to the seller) which I thought &#34;awesome&#34;. Then after a long and tired day, I washed my face and gave this tool a try. Let me state how since my lovely 30's, my face has not been the same. I have been fighting all sorts of skins problems and I have not liked what my skin has been looking like. So I try this, put on some vitamin E oil, as I put on every night and the weirdest thing happens. My face looks great in the morning!!! Let me also add how this is my time of the month, in which my face tends to look at its worst. I was so shocked, I went ahead and ordered one for my mother, my friend and one for my aunt. I am letting everyone in on this little big secret. Who knew?!?!?!?!<br /><br />Definitely worth every penny!!!
B001A3DNY6|5|The soap is great smelling and  long lasting. It is a good size. I love the lather that you get from just using a little.
B007ML0OY2|3|Shipping took forever. As far as the item I felt like it didn't do what I thought it was going to do. I ended up just going back to my regular tweezers to put my lashes on.
B00BAVKI5K|4|Got what I ordered
B0009UKUTM|5|smells wonderful. great deal considering the low price due to no box. was packaged very securely. great scent that always gets compliments
B004I689ZA|5|No problems or komplaints..THANXX! It was exactly what we were looking for and the product kame rather QUICk...VERY impressed! Will def use this service again in the future!
B000052YL1|5|5 stars
B00CXUIHAU|5|This is a great hair clip. Its more compact and snug than a regular banana clip. I have very very thick natural afro textured hair and this clip fits perfect. I've been looking all over for these but local store's and even hair stores in my area don't seem to carry them anymore. Hopefully I can find this in many colors.
B00BKHN680|5|Great, versatile pencil. Works wonders on your waterline, inner corner, to conceal a zit, reverse line your lips and more.
B007N8TZLC|5|fits and feels good
B00CYA5E1O|5|Great product.
B004I94DF2|5|Fast delivery. Pretty pastels. Love them! If u sandwich them with gel bonding, base and top coat the color lasts longer!! They are kind of thick, and do not go on very smooth. But if u put on a gel top coat, it will smooth it right out and it looks wonderful!!
B000X04AFI|3|This is a bath bomb that takes forever to fizz away. I actually thought my bath might be over before it was done fizzing. This may, in fact, be Lush's slowest-fizzing bath bomb yet.  I love the mint elements of this scent, and the scent is mostly mint, but you can definitely smell the chocolate of the cocoa butter too, which I don't like as much. The cocoa butter bits in the bomb do make the water very moisturizing-- they also make the tub kind of a mess. I'd buy this again if it didn't have the chocolate smell, but that's kind of a deal-breaker for me. I prefer straight up mint.  If you like chocolate mint scents, then this is definitely the bomb for you.
B001SHK3OC|5|Incredible price for the items. The same great scent as the big bottles have.
B00QJDXBSU|3|I was offered to review this product with a promotion and to remain completely unbiased. I was expecting this to be a hard clay, so when I opened it up, powder went flying! It does do its job, but it makes a mess.
B002G5F6LA|5|Slice of heaven takes me back (as a 58 yr old) to my youth.  I love it.  Just wish the scent lasted longer.
B0018OXOMS|5|Good
B001DNE3KQ|4|I don't shave wet or in the shower, so that's not why I purchase this. I bought it because it was reasonably priced, got reasonably good reviews for closeness of shave, and the brand got good reliability ratings.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Simple<br />Easy to hold<br />Works as well as any electric shaver<br />Charges quickly<br />Easy to clean (because it can be run under the water)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Noisy (but no more than most others)<br />Doesn't give as close a shave as real razor (but no electric shaver does)
B000QS5A0G|4|I got it in the hope it would help with my tubular problems under my teeth. Not helping as well as I had hoped.
B007MSA2RY|3|The quality and fit was below the orginial equipment purchased, leaks air and make noises, making it hard to sleep.
B00DZ3YTGK|5|Worked great to add to my cream for that extra SPF.
B000ALDK1A|5|I work construction and this is great for sunburn and other minor burns.  I also use it as a hair gel and It works great.  My hair stays put all day and is very soft the next day.  Also as I'm getting older it helps my skin from getting too wrinklelly.    Also works great as shave cream, it's clear and good for my skin so I don't have to rinse it off or use aftershave.
B00PHOCJBC|5|These were just as advertised and made great stocking stuffers for Christmas. So colorful and plentiful and reasonably priced.
B00DGB589I|4|LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have the worst dry skin and since I've turned 40 has only gotten worse, but this stuff actually works. My skin no longer feels like reptile skin.  Thank you!
B007ISRNJS|4|I use it a number of times a week.  Worth the price.
B001HJOLE4|5|I'm extremely happy with this products, my hair looks healthier already, and is barely my 2nd time using them. i went from dry-looking-extra damaged hair, to healthy shiny beautiful hair. It arrived on perfect time. I can't be happier with DR CABELLO :D
B001VCUQE6|5|After shaving with high quality electric razors for most of my life I decided to take another shot at using a blade (and hoping they wouldn't rip my face apart like in my teens).  However, the thought of taking out a second mortgage to buy razor blades was not so appealing.  After finding a nice safety razor on Amazon I started using the generic blades from my local grocery store and was puzzled that I couldn't find the old Wilkinson Sword or Remington blades I remember from my youth (yes, I'm that old).  The generic blades were okay... at best.  Looking for something a little better, I began prowling Amazon and found good reviews for the Feather New Hi-Stainless.<br />WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  No nicks, no cuts, and a very, very smooth shave.  Most of the reviews and answers to questions indicated that the Feather New Hi-Stainless blades were good for four, maybe five shaves - I am getting six or seven shaves from each blade.  To be completely honest, after seven shaves the Feather New Hi-Stainless blades were still as sharp as the generic ones from the local grocery that were at least twice the price.  I'm a convert and look forward to placing my next order.
B005WIHPQ2|5|they are all great. I am happy
B006NYDUBS|4|I love the bright colors and they add a touch of realism to my nails. But they are fragile so one have to be careful when trying to get a small piece for the whole flower.
B00B9ZQ6TE|5|I love how this product has revitalized my hair. It's now soft and manageable and doesn't break as easily as before. Definitely a 5 star product!
B002KFR628|4|I bought this at my sister's recommendation after she had a salesperson show her this in Vegas. Unfortunately, it was the wrong product...the product she loved in Vegas was Oro (see that product for reviews), which visibly gives you a life instantly. The Gratiae product line is no better or worse than any other skin care line. It does not diminish wrinkles. At least not for me, my sister or my boss.<br />It's a nice moisturizer, but so are the Olay products.<br />I won't buy these again. As for the Gratiae website and the prices there -- it makes me laugh. I'm amazed at what people will buy to look younger -- me included.<br />This just does not do what it claims. Again, other reviewers may not have much experience in other skin regimes -- I'm an addict. I'll try anything that someone tells me is wonderful. This is not wonderful. It's ordinary.<br /><br />Have recently ordered the product (Oro Instant Firming Serum) that made my sister squeal in Vegas, I will review it - honestly - after I give it a chance.<br />Until then -- save your money!
B004KEQQ6Y|5|I love this lotion. The scent is amazing. For some reason I can't find this lotion where I live. It must not be popular here. The smell stays with you all day. I recommend this lotion to anyone.  I didn't receive the nail file though.
B002NGMEVM|5|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FLAT IRONS IN THE MARKET TODAY!!  THE STEAM LOCKED IN SHINE AND LOOSE ENDS FOR MY HAIR...  THIS FLAT IRON IS THE BEST!!  GLAD I HAD THE CHANCE TO FIND A GOOD DEAL ON AMAZON,, IT RETAILS AT $129.00.. IPAID 61.00 WHICH INCLUDED SHIPPING!!!  YOU CANT GET THAT DEAL ANYWHERE ELSE.. I STRONGLY ADVISE THIS FLAT IRON TO EVERYONE.. AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR.. EUROPEAN HAIR,, CURLY HAIR,, EVEN HAIR WEAVE... LOVE YOU AMAZON!!
B0009QZYO2|5|Perfect size
B001333EN8|5|This is the original perfume and not a knockoff. It came packed just like in the department store and smelled perfect! The bonus..... Paying half the price, free shipping, and no sales tax!
B0049DMJVW|5|My Girlfriend loves this perfume I bought her the entire line she loves them all and I agree they all smile good
B00008K4UA|2|I've being using Emjoi for the past 7 years and they work great at the beginning but for some reason they start loosing speed until they die completely. This is probably the reason why they only give a one year warranty.
B0051D5U6A|4|Same great products as you would find with a distributor.  I've used MK products for years and it's tried and true even for those of us with sensitive skin.  Affordable and easy to use.
B002PQ8BQM|5|This works perfectly fine. $ days without a sweat and pain or breakouts/bumps. This is just a winner.<br />PS I have Hyperhidrosis.
B00ICN91LG|5|the truth is I can not say anything in terms of use of this product. what I know is: if you are a married man and you want your wife looks its best, then do not hesitate to buy this product. since I bought this product I have to look each month to search amazon same product. I totally recommend my wife likes. If you want your woman look beautiful then do not hesitate to buy it. also will be happier and give you better food.
B00K0ANSTU|5|great product - look natural - very happy
B00DYZ7ZCO|5|Bought for our son. He was very happy with this and still likes it today. Good product.
B000GCIBLW|5|Great price
B00GSH7RNW|5|everything is perfect.
B00IU45V3E|5|I really like my small moai soaps.They smells very good.This is great idea for the gift or you can enjoy it by yourself.
B00AE07IGK|5|I was a long time user of an expensive, well known facial cleanser until I tried Dove. I've been using it exclusively for a few years and have had very minimal breakouts since. My husband now swears by &#34;the blue dove&#34; and says he won't use anything else.
B001202DWA|5|Not only do I like this massage cream but my massage therapists love using it. So smooth, fragrance free. A massage therapist at the Golden door turned me on to this, and I've been using it ever since. Highly recommend.
B0058E3XJI|4|Great lotion doesn't compare to designer skin though
B009H6KGIY|5|This is great smelling soap. lathers well in hard water. wish they would sell in packs of three or four.
B006BL75SW|5|I have really oily skin, as in, most of my face is disgustingly oily.  This powder stays on ALL DAY and really controls the shine.  On weekends I wear it alone and during the week I put it over BB cream.  It keeps my eyeshadow from creasing as well.  It does have a peach scent, but the powder has not irritated my sensitive skin.  I have had fewer breakouts since using this powder, but maybe that is because I no longer have to touch up my makeup in the middle of the day.
B000PY17PI|4|I love this Hot Air Brush. It gets hot enough to style hair quickly without being too hot to handle. Quiet and efficient... really a great product!
B00AVASF4C|5|This is works just like the brush my mother had.  Would prefer wood - but the price difference makes this one far more attractive.
B0038ZXIG2|4|I purchased this because I recently started to use products without the chemicals etc that other products on the market have in them. Also, I was looking for anti-aging products as well so this seemed to be a perfect tester kit. I really love the foaming cleanser- it's gentle and has a very nice light smell. The toner is lovely to refresh during the day or after you take your make-up off. The scrub I thought was better than another Ole Henriksen one I have but it is still pretty grainy and I only like exfoliator's like that very occasionally. All Around, it is great to try because there are so many products and they really last. You'd think they'd be gone in a flash but a little goes a long way and you definitely get your money's worth.
B00ABIF3A8|1|I'm not sure what happened to Aveeno's face-spefic SPF lotion but this 'protect + hydrate' stuff has seemed to replace it on my local stores shelves. I bought it and put it very lightly on my face in the morning and had to deal with my eyes burning the rest of the day. I love Aveeno products but I hope this product is not replacing the face SPF lotion.  I will buy the face specific product off of Amazon but wish I could just pick it up locally instead.
B00KSO3F50|5|My first thought when I picked it up was that it was really light and fits comfortably in my hand. The blade is very sharp and the plastic cover is a great add on to keep it sharp. I only used it on a lemon though. I may update this review once I try chocolate, almonds, and other foods. My only concern is if the blade will stay sharp in the long run. I'll keep you posted.
B001B2S2W4|5|I wouldn't be without this product!  It keeps my nails strong, helps them grow fast, promotes a healthy cuticle, and enables me have the longest nails ever!!!  You won't be disappointed with this product!! Beats anything I've ever tried.  Get it now!!!
B0097L42BG|5|works great!!
B0046753EG|5|This is a long-lasting lip color that doesn't turn dry or roll off your lips.  It lasts about 12 hours.  There is a bit of fade as the day wears on, but all you need to do is reapply the gloss stick.  If you don't, you will still have color, just not as pretty as you started the day with.  I've been using this for several years now.  I try others, but have never found a long-lasting one as good.
B00132EH3K|4|One of the greatest summer scents ever created!
B000TBW4OU|5|I love this product! I don't use anything else!
B000C1UEGC|5|I'm younger and this is a more mature smell. Which usually makes it a big hit .  Will recommend to friends once I finished the bottle .
B00GJ1DLL4|5|Now my family and friends have wonderful scent options...........and these smell GREAT!!!
B0017DGOE0|5|best face wash Ive ever used! it leaves your skin feeling so clean but never dry! and it smells great. I've bought this wash 4 times now, and can't imagine switching to anything else
B003471CW6|1|First of all this thing is tiny. It measures about 2 inches across and 1 1/2 inches wide. It look like it would be the perfect size for a baby doll. The picture is very deceptive. Second, there are no red crystals on it at all. I believe I was actually sent the totally wrong item. I didn't try to send it back because the seller insisted that I pay return shipping which makes it not even worth my while to try to return it because the refund and shipping are almost equal. Don't buy this item unless you are buying it to put on a doll.
B001PMERGU|5|I really love this product. It is very lightweight, doesn't clog your pores, and has a very natural feel. It also allows your skin to breathe a lot better than other types of foundation. It covers all the minor imperfections and gives your skin a really smooth, healthy tone. Unlike cheaper products of the same kind, it doesn't have this weird orangey tint that they so often have.<br /><br />The price might seem very high but you only need a tiny drop of Dior Diorskin to cover your entire face. It usually lasts me about a year of 5 to 6 days a week use. The only problem with it being a spray that comes in a glass bottle is that there is always some left at the bottom of the container that you can't get to come out when the bottle starts running empty. This seems very frustrating given the price of the product.
B000AY63DY|5|I LOVE this product!  It is creamy and soothing and ever so soft.  I definitely see more hydration in my eye area.  Pricey...........but worth the cost.......a little goes a long way with this crème. I would definitely recommend this product.  Thank you, Carol F. Raines
B000AQE7K8|5|This is the next best thing to the real thing. Since using it daily I have found so much relief from muscle pain.  It was a very good product to puchase and really has helped.
B0009MHJE4|5|I was looking for some pure Shea butter to blend with other oils and make body butter. This was perfect.
B0014AY8MQ|5|I am taking these vitamins because I have absorption problems.  I can tell that these are more effective than pills for me because I am starting to perk up.  I definitely have to take them in juice - preferably something tropical.  Otherwise, if especially when I am already fighting nausea, I can't drink it without getting sick.  But in juice, you don't even notice them.
B008YKOXEC|5|smells like heaven in a bottle
B00N0NWJPI|5|they arrived early than the actual date, it's really cute and worth it. exactly eight as the picture shown. Ilove it so much. i wear them mostly every day! Greay deal(๑• . •๑)
B000ME2YWG|3|ok
B002QXTZ0K|4|I love this color! I did make it a little deeper by using a darker lip pencil but its cool!
B004UA8Y7C|3|Looks great for a couple of days and then starts fading.  Hard to get off your skin.
B00TTUTRJC|5|very nice try it!
B00W8Q15RQ|2|Smells good but it clouds up in my diffuser.
B00A63UI80|5|I typically buy these products directly from Bath & Body Works, but because I had a credit on Amazon, I decide to go that route. The scent lasts all day and is not too overpowering that it would annoy others. It lathers really well and leaves me feeling clean.
B00DX7CUZK|3|Great product but I was surprised and dissapointed that it didn't come with the razor tray and I am told you can't get one. Even went to the site and asked when one would be available but no answer:(  it I had the tray I would have given the product a 5 star rating.
B000CSXO1W|5|This eye creme has definitely helped my dry eyes.  I live in the desert and it's cold and super dry here right now.  I put this on at night and the skin around my eyes still feels moist in the morning.  I would definitely recommend this product.
B000CNOANI|2|This didn't smell the same as my last bottle of Hot Couture. Not sure if it's old or what, but I'll probably not order online again.
B006LRRQK8|3|They look very fake. I will have to trim them back to not look like a streetwalker.
B00EXPTR0W|5|Great value, great product. I have sensitive skin and prefer the quality of these blades for my everyday shaving needs.
B00J42G2UW|5|Very good electric toothbrush that works on Batteries, so it's real handy and can also be taken on camping trips etc. The head of the brush is nice and big, not like these dinky electric toothbrush heads, typical to most of the other brands. And the price is awesome. Love it!!!
B00KWEYSGG|3|Sold as replacement for Braun energy cells.<br />Works, almost.<br />The seal doesn't quite seat as firmly as original.<br />Slight leakage which needs fiddling with.<br />It is better than having no refill at all.
B002DL9M2G|3|good product bit arrived open with some cream spilled out
B001GS6OB4|5|it works great and effectively as advertized.
B007QUX69O|5|Over priced as most African  American hair products ard now days. Just ok product. I find it to be more of a softner than curl activator
B003V37Z9W|5|Got this razor for my husband for a Christmas gift and he LOVES it.  Works much better than his old Panasonic razor.  He has a very heavy beard.  He spend less time and gets a much better shave than before.  It is worth the money.
B009OX6AOE|3|Nothing special about this. It is just a matte white powder that I can get anywhere at any drug store.
B00SGU7DU6|5|Ok first off let me say how many amazing benefits there are for using raw honey on your skin. It is amazing for healing. I could get deep into this subject but its a great antibiotic. My daughter had a breakout on her face. Used this, her face looked 95% better after using it. The redness on her forehead was almost gone. It is a bit sticky and thick. But its honey. It smells so amazing. Heck, I am sure you could even taste if you want. But I didn't taste it. When using the mask it feels so soothing. And after taking it off your skin actually feels tighter and I saw a reduction in pores on my nose. I have huge pores. This was a plus for me. Your skin is left feeling so smooth. I just wish this was a bigger container of this stuff. Because it's amazing. I will be getting more of this for sure. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for inspection and my honest opinion.
B001U1HI5I|3|If you are not particular about your hair cut,this machine really works. Someone does have to do some light trimming around the ears and back. Robocut pays for itself after three or four haircuts.
B000EPA4GQ|5|Great product. Does take a bit longer to rub in than some other products--though I think those tend to contain alcohol which can irritate/dry out skin. Small size can be too little for longer trips, but is nice when traveling with only airline carry-on as it meets TSA liquid volume requirements.
B003USJVEA|1|At the beginning, it seemed a little bit improvement. But after a week ,I found my skin become rough even worse. I'll never use it again!
B009E1QT6A|5|Good
B00JBMY86U|5|love the fresh scent
B006G263NO|1|I ordered my Outer SOL Bohemian hair weave from BuyWigsHair.com to say I was disappointed, would be an understatement. After reading the reviews of this particular seller, I felt confident that I would receive great product! The<br />shipping was very prompt. I received my<br />purchase within 3 days, which I was excited!!<br />Until I open the box! The hair looks completely<br />plastic or synthetic. Looking a lot like baby doll<br />hair!  After previewing several YouTube videos/<br />tutorials before purchasing. I'm thinking I found the diamond in the<br />rough&#34; $17 yes...I know what you're thinking, well you get what you pay for.  Maybe my expectations of this hair was<br />set too high. :(  But to top it all off! Tis the reason why I write this review.... Ladies my bundle very skimpy!!!! Smh. It appears someone has borrowed !!!!! some!!!!!  And the NERVE  of them after taking some, to not put ANY &#34;how to&#34; instructional directions back in the box!  So how am I supposed to care for this plastic Mess?!! even beauty supply hair give you some care directions. Smh fool me once, shame on me! buywigsandhair Nope!  YOU won't get a second chance...I got your first impression!  Thumbs down¡¡¡
B001MA0QY2|5|The best...I tried others, and there's no comparison! Gave one to my son, and he loved too. It was recommended to me by my wise daughter!
B00CR68MQY|3|Beautiful selection, but the base (the flat part that sits inside) is much too small.  Otherwise the product was fine, and shipped on time
B004DARIBC|5|This is the perfect mix of hold, without looking greasy or messy. Best hairspray I've ever used. Have a friend who's a hair stylist who suggested I try it. A tad expensive, but worth it.
B00F2FJKSQ|5|These stainless steel colorful heart earrings are so cute and unique and I am so glad that I ordered them. They are large enough to cover my earlobe. They arrived very quickly and in a gift box with a bracelet that was an unexpected surprise gift. I LOVE these earrings. Will order from this seller again.
B000KQ7X8G|4|I've always loved pureology products and this conditioner is amazing! I have color treated hair and this leaves my hair very soft without being heavy. Very fast shipping!
B004IGKY4Y|5|I'm very pleased with these cloths. I have sensitive skin, so I use them just once a week. They make my skin feel smooth, but they don't dry out my skin. They're not harsh at all.
B0036WTV2C|5|The best mouthguards out there, and I've tried a few. Can easily last a good year if not longer for me, and I grind my teeth hard. Dog unfortunately has developed a taste for chewing these up, but I've gone back and re-bought these each time.
B003BQ6QXK|5|Great quality - works perfectly!  I LOVE the little shelf for my razor and the little squeegee for wiping down the water droplets after I get out of the shower.  It remained totally fog-free!
B00G99S4WW|5|Very true to description, received on date posted for shipping. Overall smooth transaction. Thanks!
B0014P8L9W|5|Great product.  Highly recommended.
B0006V7Y8Y|3|Smells nice but I don't think is protects as well as some super market brands so I will not buy it again
B000XZKVHE|5|I used this for several years. If you have you have combination skin or are using drying products like retinal this will actually exfoliate those areas. You may not need it everyday but it works great befor moisturizing.
B003RF82UK|5|I get itchy, red rashes from oil of olay sensitive, so I was worried about whether this would do its job.  I love it!  Glides on easily, dries fast, and leaves my skin soft-without the itchiness of other moisturizers!  No more search for a moisturizer that works AND feels great!  Thank you Garnier, for a great product that really does its job!
B00107BB82|5|I love baths. It is my favorite part of the day. These baths salts smell wonderful and I love to just soak. They are green and turn the water a slight green color but I have had no problems with it staining my tub. Just fill your tub with lots of water and lay back and enjoy.
B004N7JIKE|5|it's a great color for hair, Smells good and it's really gentle with hair. The color on hair is really gorgeous
B00C1K4OEK|5|This body butter goes a long way and feels amazing. The scent is strong, but pleasant. I use this and completely skip perfumes. I don't use it on large areas (mostly just on dry spots), but I assume it might be slightly overpowering if used that way. I can't recommend it enough!
B00CJQDKBY|5|Great stand-alone color. It's a nice gray-toned white. Matches the ps4 &#34;glacier white&#34; controller pretty well, for any of you that are gamers.
B002UJ31HS|3|I liked it well enough for my hair or cuticles, but it made my face break out.  I probably would not purchase again because it's so expensive.
B002617YU0|5|I am 60 and, although I have very few wrinkles (Thank you, sunscreen!), I do have dry skin and a bit of redness around the nose. While trying out new foundations at Sephora, I came across Givenchy's Photo'Perfexion and was thrilled with its buildable coverage and its light diffusing properties. Photo'Perfexion imparted a smooth and even coverage that didn't settle into lines and it gave me a soft glow that looked radiant rather than pearly or shiny.  The foundation is somewhat expensive, but a little bit goes a long way towards achieving a beautiful finish.  One pump dispenses just enough to provide moderate coverage to the entire face so there is never any waste. And, although you should never rely solely on make-up to provide adequate sun protection, Photo'Perfexion's SPF 20 is a nice bonus. Unfortunately, the foundation comes in a very limited selection of shades, but I was lucky enough to find one that's a good match for my skin tone. Hopefully, you will be as lucky, too.
B000REOEYM|4|Large enough to hold onto and strong enough to cut toenails. High quality toe nail clippers.<br />Would recommend this item to my friends
B0015SB4LA|5|My hands get very dry and cracks develop in the Winter.  This is the best product I have found yet to take care of the cracks.  It used to be readily available in local stores, but now Amazon is the best source for the product.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try.<br />Remember, although it is called a creme it is really a thick liquid,  Don't worry about it not being a creme, give it a try.
B0036QFZ46|5|Great product and the delivery was fast. I love the Hempz brand and would buy for this seller again.
B004CNE98K|5|Color is as described very nice and the price was amazing
B001OAB7Z2|5|It does the trick and that's not easy to do with my skin. I do use it over a moisturizer however because it can be hard to get makeup on if its not moist enough - it still controls oil quite well (and that's what I was more concerned about) and I know I have the SPF on to protect my face. I have been in the makeup/skin care biz for a long time, so I've seen many products that fail. Murad always knows what its doing and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for once. Also, this product lasts a pretty long time, so its worth it.
B003L3OQ76|5|This stuff is great! Makes your hair so shiny and soft.  I'd recommend it to everybody especially with long hair.
B00C20CW5W|5|Love these so fun to play with and came in before the date they said love them....
B000FKJQ14|5|1. It smells fantastic yet not overpowering.  2. It contains mica, therefore your skin will be covered in sparkles!  3. This lotion protects like no other. After recently getting married I kept looking down at my beautiful rings and wishing my hands look better.  Since I bought this lotion I have recommended it to all of my friends and family I have spoken to.  Since I have a parrot I have scratches all over my hands on a regular basis--but not anymore!  My skin heals so much faster when I use Quench.  It's almost as if it contains triple antibiotic ointment of some sort.    As I write this I look down at my beautiful, sparkly, healthy hands.  Something I've only dreamed about since I was young!
B006RFZ66K|5|They make my face feel more clean than just washing it--and you can see all of the dirt and oil it bring out, too!
B00A3Z99PY|5|i love it!
B000EQ2VE8|4|I like this product because it contains no alcohol and is not very heavy. However, why did Trimedica decide to remove the label, \\"No Heavy Metals, Guranatee 99.9% Pure\\" from the product I received? It used to have it in the older batches that I ordered. This seems kinda shady on Trimedica's part and makes me a bit uneasy. Therefore I'm going to try the MRM MSM Cream instead.
B00ENU1SP4|5|been using this brush for almost a month now and so far so good. the flat one is the one i used most of the time in applying my liquid foubdation.
B00DIACSQ8|1|The hair sheds too much and fuzzy. You get what you pay for. Not that quality but looked nice the first week installed
B006RJXW4O|5|nowadays, i am generally skeptical about \\"overpromised\\" skin treatments, but this one actually seems to do what it promised.  my husband was away on a fairly long business trip as i began the treatment.  when he returned he kept saying there was something different about me-- even going so far as to accuse me of botox (which we have both agreed is unsafe and unnatural) when i \\"confessed\\" as to what i was using on my skin, he suggested i keep up the good work!
B00PEXKVE8|5|I love these travel silicone bottles!  I originally bought them to put shampoo, conditioner, and lotion in for our upcoming cruise. But these are so adorable I wanted to find other uses!  I also use them to store salad dressing for my lunch box.  My husband stores coffee creamer in it for his work mini-fridge.<br />Pros:<br />Air tight twist top lid<br />Upside down storage so contents easily squeeze out<br />Snap style top with small hole for contents to exit<br />Suction cup on side of bottle to attach to shower wall<br />Cons:<br />NONE!<br />*I received this product for review purposes.  The opinions are honest, unbiased, and 100% my own.
B006UET4XE|5|LOVE THIS LOVE!! I have never liked a eye product of this type, BUT I love this!! will reorder
B00B83I7F8|5|This almost the only place you can buy this variety of Glue-on nails.<br />The nails themselves are beautiful and fit nicely!<br />I am very pleased with my purchase and the timely manor in which I received them..Thank you!
B000GF1E54|5|I have never known a creme to be so rich and it holds the moisture throughout the whole day and into the night.  I use the derma e Microdermabrasion Scrub twice a week and this creme morning and night and I'm thrilled with the results. No more dryness or dullness....these are excellent products and I have now made them my daily routine.
B000QYBB4E|4|This is really an excellent razor, I love the adjustability. There are two ways it could be improved. It needs a significantly longer handle (it's really short) and it could use some type of non slip surface on the handle.
B004DK4CH0|5|I have color treated hair and this stuff helps keep my hair soft and smooth! Just use as soon as you get out of the shower and style as usual, helps dull hair look a bit healthier. Buy this stuff often.
B00HDFKFJ6|5|Very good to my skin -- I'm loving this. It makes my hands feel very soft.
B001F51V9S|5|Just what I was looking for and good pricing, and quick delivery.
B004VN31JO|5|I received it very quickly, and I was able to fit 102 polish bottles!!! OPI, Orly, Color club, China Glaze, Essie, OPI Nicole, and Zoyas!!! LOVE IT!!! Will be buying more very soon!!!!!
B0052P1Y3A|4|Works really really good over night, night after night after night... you must use it often, but it is GREAT STUFF
B003RD53R2|5|one of my favorite !!
B00005CDSF|5|I'm an avid Amazon shopper but have never felt compelled to write a review about a product until now.  Since having a baby last September, my hair became extremely curly and VERY dry and frizzy.  I've tried everything, from shampoos to conditioners to different hair brushes and hair sprays and styling products.  Nothing really worked until I tried this hair dryer.  I used it for the first time today and I immediately noticed a difference in my hair.  It was MUCH softer and I'd say the frizz is reduced by at least 75%!!!!  I'm so excited I can hardly stand it.  Any one with dry, frizzy hair absolutely must try an ionic hair dryer!
B002DOO1VA|1|I love this shany brush set the best good quality
B00NYHRNL0|5|Great product.  Nice packaging, works as described.
B00Y9UN08Q|2|Cheap, easy.
B0047ERQJI|5|(I forgot about this account of mine since last christmas time so i apologize for doing a review 1 year old! Even with this being i said i can still say with 100% confidence THIS ITEM WAS SHIPPED FAST and WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED! Perfect tint & one of my favorite MOUSSE/'SOUFFLE' FOUNDATIONS OF IT'S KIND (PRICE AND PURPOSE) Provides GOOD COVER but still BLENDS WELL & didn't make me break out! A little goes a long way unlike MANY MANY other foundations that you get a lot in only to find you need a quarter of the bottle to get your coverage!!<br /><br />Thank you!! Will love to do business with again!
B005TOXDUG|4|I love the product. It gives a flawless effect leaving the skin looking glowing and healthy. It is the best daywear foundation. It blends very easily.
B0012UTRNI|5|Fast delivery and good prices......what more can you ask for
B0065I0UMO|5|I've had quite a journey this past year and a half.  After I quit nursing my son, I got cystic acne on my cheeks, chin and jaw line.  Anything touching my skin would cause cystic acne, like hats, helmets, my toddler (all of which I do clean, I swear!).  I opted not to take hormones to fix what was quite obviously a hormonal issue.  Instead, I added probiotics and discovered what actually works for my skin: exfoliate and moisturize.  In the evenings, I cleanse with oil to get my sunscreen off, then I wash again with Ren Evercalm.  I learned my skin is a bit sensitive, so I have to alternate evenings between P50v (lactic acid) and retinol.  Sometimes I even put a break night in between if I feel a hint of tightness in my face. I moisturize with this stuff. I learned my moisturizer simply cannot smell lovely or have added gimmicky stuff like AHA or citric acids.  I just have to let the full blown acids do their job and let the moisturizer just moisturize.  Being concerned about acne, I was very worried about shea butter in the ingredients list (I guess it really breaks some people out??), but I've had no problems.  I used to just use cheap drug store finds for my skin.  I absolutely cannot do that any longer :(  I haven't had cystic acne or even regular pimples for a while, though.<br /><br />Oh!  In my journey, I tried the FAB radiance pads and quite like them.  If your skin can handle the strong stuff, do the Biologique Recherche, but for sensitive, dryish skin these pads were lovely.  I cut mine in half like someone kindly suggested here on Amazon.  I can't explain it, though, but the P50v makes my skin more radiant and glowy.  Or it might just be all in my head, trying to justify the money spent :)
B004Z209HS|5|This product has become my skin care staple. It moisturizers my skin, leaves it feeling soft, and all with no chemicals whatsoever. I don't use it under my eyes because I find that it makes my eyes water and itch as the day goes on.
B00GBC0JVG|5|I love this!!!! Easy installation and I surprisingly &#34;need&#34; another one.
B000QF3MUO|5|very good color
B00538TSMU|4|My grand daughter was really pleased. It was a great price and well worth it, especially since she loves wearing them.
B00HLZ8SG0|5|I'm a cosplayer so I'm always buying wigs of varying prices. I've had $60 wigs fall apart and not last 6 months. I was a little worried when I ordered this wig for 9 dollars but what the hell.<br /><br />The wig came 3 weeks earlier than expected. The packaging was fine and the wig came with a wig cap, the wig cap came with a little tear along the seam but that's no big deal I have a lot. The wig was soft and in the correct color. Not a lot of shine as opposed to most that I usually get. The bangs were a little crooked but that's no big deal and an easy fix. The wig is full, and the wefts don't show, it's one of the more natural looking wigs I've seen.<br /><br />I wore the wig for a couple of hours to see how it would hold up for a normal convention day. When I took it off there were hardly any tangles and when I brushed it almost none of the hair fell out.<br /><br />All in all I'm very happy with the product and I'm very excited to wear it to Colossalcon in two months. I would recommend this product to anyone and to cosplayers.
B009ZYLRAO|5|Modern fun color  all of the young ones loved it.<br />Great gift .<br />They think that I am so this century
B00BZWUHBO|5|The scent of this product is awesome - spicy and citrus-y.  I always get comments about it when I use it.  If find this oil to be slightly better for moisturizing than the lotion in this same line.
B000BRGS08|5|This eye cream is the best.  If you have lines around the eyes this definately minimizes them and makes you look and feel younger.  I would highly recommend this.
B00GIYZ14C|5|My husband really likes the foam and uses it every day.  After 6 months of use his hair is getting thicker!
B00IACUSDE|5|Favorite fragrance at a good price
B001OI142K|3|I spent extra money to have this imported hand made bottle expecting something unique. I thought the variety represented would also mean a unique bottle. It was better than a brown glass bottle with a plastic top. I just thought it would be a bit more exotic. The oil was fragrant and beautiful. The bottle was nice. I would buy again but perhaps try contacting the seller about getting a nicer bittle next time.
B000J2CTYE|5|Love this fragrance. It is like no other. Pairs nicely with the soap of the same fragrance. A very sexy all woman smell that exudes confidence.
B000FADNZ4|1|The reformulated clear version of this stuff is horrible and BURNS MY SKIN. Nature's Gate customer service says all that has changed is that they removed witch hazel from the formula. Please. I'm not an idiot. This stuff also lasts about 1/3 as long as the old formula did. I'll never buy it again, especially since customer service was not helpful.
B0047ZVSYG|5|Works just as good as my old Oster 76's and this product is less expensive, lighter to handle, and cuts quiet as well!
B00RKU15BG|5|Product was cracked when it arrived,  contactd vender who immediately sent out a replacement the case fits great looks &#34;wonderful&#34; lol...
B001TH8Q72|5|Love this easy to travel with does the job!
B00LHKQVSW|5|5 STARZ
B00H7O60XS|5|This is good as a moisturizer for feet and hands. My grown children borrowed some to try and they like it. They want to buy some for themselves. I used this when I was a little girl when my mother would buy it. &#34;Smells great&#34;!!!
B008GWTSAC|5|I bought this bath set for a friend as a birthday gift and I'm glad I did. It has a \\"spa\\" like feel without the crazy price. She said the texture on the loofah and back scrubber is gentle but does a great job of exfoliating dry skin. All in all a nice gift.
B00404XBM6|4|saves more money than other similar blades<br />Lasts longer than expected<br />easy to use<br />Have puchased this before and will do again
B002CEV1W8|5|This product is great!! The smell is good and it does not irritate the eyes like some other products. My hair came out beautifully and was not stiff. You only need to apply a little of it. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AGSAQBE|1|By far the worst extensions I've ever bought.  They're too thin and look nasty I would never wear in public. The sewing of the clip was done poorly.  I threw the extensions in the trash where they belong! !
B00DEX61A8|4|Nice smell, not thick or greasy.
B0002ZS442|5|My senior dog's teeth were getting quite a bit of tartar near the gums. He's well tempered, so I decided to try this double sided scrapper to attack the worse of it. The slanted edges works well, and depending on his position, I can easily  switch the blade angle. I lay his head in my lap, pull his lips back and go to work. He just lays there and takes it like a champ. He lets me know when he's had enough, and I let him go. Best to do a little at a time so he'll tolerate it at all!
B004KEML0Y|4|Dyeing sideburns is a waste of time. The effect is gone in about a week. Tween-Time  I can apply in seconds and it holds its color for  24 hours and beyond. Also great for coloring patches of gray-although I don't recommend it's overuse because the color is flat and could be obvious. Even better is using it directly on the scalp where hair is thinning, as long as it can be concealed under the hair. Keep the stick wet when using and it is very effective. Use your fingers to spread the color around rather than &#34;drawing&#34; with the stick to cover everything.<br /><br />Biggest complaint: The 'browns' are too reddish and this is why one should apply it sparingly. Not difficult to use at all but I would recommend a few trial runs in private before going public!
B00K39SY9W|5|I love this fragrance and will order it again.
B0014ZWHO2|5|awesome
B0055S4CRY|5|I've used this for about 10 days, and am very happy with the results.  I think my neck looks better, firmer, and some of the lines on my face seem better, too.  I should have had this 10 years ago.  Great price, great product, better than other creams I've tried.
B004XA81ZE|5|I was surprised this brush actually detangled my thick, curly, and often matted hair. I won't lie, I am too lazy to brush my hair everyday, as it's a tormenting, painful activity, so I comb my hair 2-3 time a week. This perpetuates the matting and rat's-nest malady. Much to my surprise, this brush went through the knots, although pulled some hair, but did brush my hair and un-knotted it as none other before it. I'm stunned, grateful, and very impressed.
B001E77OUM|4|Overall, it is a great product, I love that it does not dry my hands, but the smell might be a little too much for some. Some of my guests were bothered by smell as it has natural oils of eucalyptus and lavender.  The smell overall is hard to explain, I personally, love it, smells &#34;naturally&#34;, I love it! It does not foam as much as some other chemically induced soaps. Overall, I would suggest it to anyone- natural goodness.
B005O0SBHA|4|I received the bottles intact , packaging well secured , no dents ,leakage or damage to box.  I have been using the vitamins for appx 3 weeks since I received them . So far so good . No untowrad side effects from the vitamins .  Not halfway through bottle #1 . I can provide a more thorough review upon the completeion of the bottle .  I have been using the vitamin in my daily green smoothie mix . Hair pretty much the same ... can say have noticed strength in nails , but no substancial or out of the ordinary growth .  The weather is warming, skin not so dry  and I am also using a new cuticle oil , so that might be contributing as well .
B00JMJ6E5A|5|I took this curling iron with me to a destination wedding in Mexico. After a week the sun, salt water and pool water had frizzed my hair despite conditioner and protective hair product.  Thanks goodness it worked well on my thick hair and probably saved the wedding photos.
B006ZZVL1G|4|Arrived on time, appears used in good condition. Box and warranty card are faded and item just looks used - also manufacturer website states they will not honor warranty for items purchased from unauthorized sites. Was billed as \\"New\\". However, I would have paid this for a used product in good condition, and this item is still working well after a few weeks. My step-daughter came home from the mall with one she paid $200 for. I choked at the price but LOVED the straightener when I borrowed it. I couldn't bring myself to pay that and found this identical item here for $39. I have thick, coarse, curly hair. This straightener is like a miracle. It leaves my hair soft and silky, and now I that I have learned the technique for making waves and spiral curls with a straightener, I don't need any other products.I let it dry naturaly and then straighten. No more packing blow dryer, straightener, and curling iron.  I don't use hair spray or gel with it, and the style holds up better than with any other product I've used. Well worth the price, but again, I am skeptical that mine was new, and I would prefer the seller be honest. One last point, the ability to set the temperature up to over 400 F is probably the biggest difference between this and the Chi I have. My Chi does not have a temperature control and cannot compare to this product despite it's $150 price tag.
B003U8K6M6|2|I was looking for a trimmer for my goatee,that would simplify my ease in trimming my beard.My beard is too short for this trimmer.For someone with a longer,full beard,this might be o.k.
B00COG2L8W|1|Did not fit well
B002RXK1UC|3|It wasn't the exact scent of rosemary I was looking for. I know I shouldn't judge too harshly knowing that I never smelled the herb before, but I couldn't get over how much it smelled like Vix and lemons. On the bright side it does leave my hair super soft. Hopefully I'll be buying again from this brand.
B004UQ6Q62|1|Completely ineffective. The razor's inability to cut hair consistently requires so many passes that it negates any time benefit from using an electric razor. It is also extraordinarily irritating. Very disappointed, Braun should be ashamed of this product.
B0001EL7H0|5|I love it! It's a hard to find product and it works...
B00A6O1BF8|5|Love! Great price for so much stuff. Was exactly what I had ordered. Thank you so much! I love the dotters!
B007YC66ZA|5|I have loved the Ultra Mirage II mask for years and never thought I would switch.  When I saw this mask and thought about how I sometimes lose the seal when I toss and turn, I thought I would give this a try.  I'll never go back...this is my new favorite mask.
B00KFNDWSY|3|Meh
B0017QSTDQ|5|My favorite
B00BAZ60Y4|5|I bought this tool along with some others to do my own gel manicures and I have to say this tool is great quality! I would purchase again for sure!
B0045FRIWE|5|great timing and great condition!  love it!  smells so good!
B004OVFMRW|5|Love this product
B00885N9ZW|1|I've never had any problems ordering from Amazon. EVER. This did not arrive as described. The description, and photo, show that all 3 products would be Forbidden Euphoria scented. My package came with only one. The other two were the much stronger Euphoria. Sadly disappointed.
B00016X68G|4|Ingredients on this website: Olive oil, coconut oil, castor oil, fresh pure new hampshire spring water, sodium hydroxide (a binder), rosemary-lavender-cedarwood and other essential oils for fragrance.  Ingredients on the one I received: Saponified Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Castor Oil, Sunflower Oil, and Organic Palm Kernel Oil, Vit. E  The formula seems to have changed.  I contacted the company as to the source of Vit E.,as the top sources are wheat and soy. The company responded quickly--the source for Vit E is rapeseed oil.
B001BSH2E2|5|Works great, and very handy to reach difficult to reach areas. Would definitely buy again
B00H93NJLS|5|Unlike so-called &#34;Argan&#34; oil that I've used in the past, this oil is odorless. I combine this Argan oil with rosehip oil along with a few drops of lavender essential oil to create my own night time moisturizer, which works great on my skin. 4oz is quite enough for making a variety of skin/hair DIY products!
B0056JVQ8A|5|Have used this three times now and I really love using it.    I'm using it everywhere including face and neck and it has worked beautifully from the first time I used it.    I had a little bump on my back that kept scabbing over (sorry!) and it just would not heal!  It had been there for about a month.  The first day I used this on that area it never re-scabbed and healed right up.  My face feels and looks very smooth.  My skin just feels great all over.  It even feels nice while you are using it - not at all irritating.
B00H2RAYYQ|5|I haven't purchased a better pin. The back is strong and the pin sits snug and wont fall out . . .
B00G9CS2IK|5|Super great seller so easy to communicate with! The headbands are super cute and they sent just the colors I asked for. My cheer leaders loved wearing them for their performance! Thank you Kenz Laurenz for a great buying experience.
B004HNETL2|4|I used other After Shave before this and it use to burn a little but this doesn't burn at all and it feels like we are applying a lotion, doesn't make the face dry (it says moisturizer, TRUE !), pretty good. Also the fragrance is pretty mild which I like. But it does not give much cooling effect after application but its fine.<br />The image shown is not the one I received. This one looks larger pack
B0009OAHIW|4|Fragrance is mild, very calming and it helps you to feel at ease.  Get a lot of compliment, really like it.
B000FZXGEC|5|I love this shampoo because 1) It takes very little to create a lot of foam and 2) it cleans my hair very well. My hair is very long and thick/tangle-y so usually I end up using a bottle (of a shampoo like Pantene) of this size in ~2 weeks. This so far has lasted longer than that and I expect it to last a while more. Also it smells really good and I feel like my hair has had less tangles overall since using. Hooray!
B001540XWK|5|this product worked really well! I dyed my hair pink for fun and it stayed in long enough and did not feel like hair spray. It had good color and did not dry my hair out like a lot of hair dyes. I would recommend this product.
B00H59LRJM|5|I love this product!! I recently discovered this product a couple months ago! It helped my hair from falling out and it grew some back!!!I'm out of this and can tell because my hair is falling out now without it!!Great product don't understand why its not out on the shelves in every store!!??
B00IB1L2KC|5|After trying the facial line of Oshi Glows - Clay mask and serums - which I love - I had to try the body butter for full body especially after this unbelievable winter we have had.  I love it! This body butter is rich in nutrients to combat current weather conditions and is getting me ready for Spring and Summer!  Cannot beat the price point and moreso the consistency of this product has integrity.  It has a wonderful texture, a small amount goes along way and it smells amazing!<br /><br />If you want to be &#34;at the ready&#34; for Spring and Summer and combat current weather you would be wise to give it a whirl!<br /><br />Thank you Oshi Glows for yet another line extension that I Love!
B001ECQRU0|5|I discovered Eucryl in Scotland a couple of years back, and found it a great alternative to the barrage of mint-flavored tooth care products we're stuck with in the US.
B001V9SXXU|5|Very moisturizing with a nice clean smell.  Will keep using this product!
B00PATJ7AK|4|This is a good product if you have hair that gets tangled easily. However, it's not terribly convenient to use.  I have moderately long hair that gets difficult to comb through the longer it gets. I prefer my hair long, but I finally give in to frustration and get it cut when it gets too tangled.  This product helps because it really does make a difference. The scent is quite pleasant and summery. The best way to use it is to put it on your hair about twenty minutes before you wash it. Personally, that's a pain to me. However, for those times when it's difficult to get a comb through my hair, it's worth it.
B005LLCL9Q|5|This is wonderful soap.  You feel cleaner than ever and this product does not dry out your skin.  First( but not last) time buyer!
B001OQKVO4|5|I use another brand, but i wanted try world loreal and i am happy ,The product is like i expected, thank's
B00AYSUKTE|5|My favorite daily moisturizer with SPF.  Glides on smooth and easy, no scent, but great sun protection.
B003AKHQG8|4|It does what it suppose to do wave your have and it looks good! But it gets hot all over and it's easy to burn yourself.
B004Z209HS|5|I ordered this oil so I could mix it with essential oils to make a hair mask. WOW am I impressed! The quality is great and when combined with my essential oils it was a powerhouse. My hair is shinier and healthier than ever. Definitely ordering again.
B008U04H1A|1|Wig is substandard, extremely dull, lopsided, and in my opinion defective.  The seller Beauty'sBin offers absolutely no recourse.  Great price if it was quality, but in my case, it is money right down the drain.
B00Q635E6A|2|I noticed no change in my skin.
B007JQA35K|4|I really liked the pattern and color of these nail wraps. For a first timer, I was also pleased at the ease of application. I trimmed a few a little bit in order to better fit my nails, but that was easy to do. The very tips wore down a little bit, but it was even, and hardly noticeable. I wait tables, so am very hard on my hands...they lasted about a week, which is better than nail polish, but I was honestly hoping for something in the 10 day range. I started putting on a clear top coat at about day 3 or 4 to try to keep them around longer, but they started chipping off around day 6. They were a fun experiment, and I might try something like this again if I was going to be on vacation or something, where I wasn't going to be so hard on my nails, but I can't justify this expense every week...I'll have to make due with polish. They were pretty easy to remove with polish remover, too.
B005W1DZG8|3|Quick review<br /><br />Pro - It makes the perfect curl everytime!<br />Con - The curls can only go the one way so they eventually all combine as one.
B000QSDHPG|2|I was excited to try this product because I had read so many great things about DevaCurl.  I ordered the sample sizes and I am so glad that I did.  The fragrance of the products was pleasant and the first day I used them I liked the results.  It was the next couple of days that were disastrous.  My hair felt like a gunky, stringy mess. There were no beautiful curls! What I had was a precursor to dreadlocks! When people asked me what I was using on my hair, it wasn't because they were envious.  I guess I will switch back to Paul Mitchell Curly products.
B001DCDPIS|5|Love this product! Expected delivery date was the 8th-23rd of April and I got it on the 6th. Keeps my blacks black and colors bright.
B0050PSC00|5|Very happy with the cricket flat iron.  And recieved it in a timely manner.
B00GUJ4WBS|5|smells superb, bottle us a decent size as well.
B0090UJFYI|5|Great to use with needling. No smell, no reactions, right consistency.
B001KSR8XS|1|When I ordered this lotion, I thought I'd receive the ORIGINAL scent formula, as described and pictured. I received the new formula, which doesn't smell the same at all, the bottle is scratched and dented. I was going to give this to my mom as a gift because it's her favorite scent and I don't even want to give it to her now.
B008GR4L18|5|This looks so real, it feels almost like human hair..Thick and Beautiful and just as described! Also so affordable, perfect for those of us who want hair or just to change the looks of what we have! Buy this wig you will love it as much as I do!
B00FFANXMM|4|Lately I have noticed that my face has started to look dim. I don't really know how else to say it, but there was just something off about my complexion.<br />I researched and found out that vitamin C could be just the thing I was looking for.<br /><br />I decided to try this product because of the high reviews. After trying this serum I am convinced that it could help anyone who wants their skin to feel smoother and softer.<br />An added bonus is the fact that it goes on so smoothly with no bad smells.<br /><br />I will be recommending this to all my friends.
B005OYDID8|2|does not cut all the hairs,  leaves many whiskers untouched, no matter how many times you go over it. save your money.
B000F65JSC|2|I used this for a couple months but didn't really notice a difference with my eye area.
B00JVVC8IG|5|I love this make up! it is so easy to apply and lasts all day.  I would recommend this product to everyone looking to try something new.
B0084H4HAA|5|I have been searching for a under eye product for a few months now. The others I have tried either end up making my eyes water, sting or turn red and itchy. I want a product that actually works, doesn't sting, is natural and doesn't just sit on my skin, I want it to actually absorb into my skin. I can confidently say this has hit my every want. Thus far I have been using it for about 2 weeks and my under eye area actually FEELS moisturized, even after I wash my face at night. My under eye skin doesn't feel dried out or anything, it feels softer. I have some very fine lines and puffiness creeping up on me as Im looking at 50 out the windshield of life so they are expected, yet I don't want to turn to unnatural ways of nourishing my skin or use weird fillers or anything. This peeper keeper (ok I LOVE the fun name as well) is a thick, balm almost chapstick consistency with really no smell that I could detect. No stinging, redness or sensitivity from it at all. A little goes a long way too, heck Ive been using it on the fine lines around my upper lip as well. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants something natural that actually works and doesn't cost and arm & a leg. While I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review...I can honestly say I love this product!
B0015KHMRS|5|this was the highlight of my primeday  experience  works good mainly bought for the mini trimmer and the 35% off deal that day
B000P9B3R0|2|Nothing to write home about. Actually dries my hair a little. Not too much shine either.
B00ADQPKK6|5|My hairdresser used this product on my hair and I had to have more.  I have the driest, frizziest, color damaged hair and I use this when my hair is still damp and it REALLY tames the frizziness and allows just the curl and waves to come through. It is not heavy and just a tiny bit gives HUGE shine! My hair looks like spun gold. The smell is not the greatest, smells like vanilla cookies to me, which I guess is fine but I prefer something with a more clean or floral scent. This stuff is pricey and I need to use several sprays of this product to tame my hair but it one of the only things that I have found that actually works on my frizzy, dry hair.
B007124J9I|2|I purchased this through Amazon. I like the air brush but the makeup not so much. If you have fine lines this makeup will make you look 10 years older. You will have lines and wrinkles you never knew you had. I seriously looked better without makeup than I did with this. I am in the process of ordering Temptu silicone based foundation since I heard you could use it in this airbrush.
B004XSAILQ|5|I just turned 40 and have fair skin; I've always used drugstore cosmetics- like the neutrogena 3-in-1 concealer, but decided to treat myself to this just to see...I'm so happy I did.  I have pretty good dark circles and with just a few dabs...gone...with other concealers, I have to layer...this blended right in, easy to use, such quality a little goes a long way!
B003UKM9CO|4|Great price nice small stand. Keeps a charge for at least 5 days. Definitely recommend
B00392FQSM|5|LOVE!!! After trying to make my own natural hygiene products, I decided to try this. Smells great, leaves my hair soft and not greasy...one of my faves!!
B00HPN8H4G|1|the extension is more so for a  small child or someone who has a really little head.  no usage for it a tall and they did not give me any return information to send it back.
B004GNMP0U|5|Awesome. I thought for the price it wouldn't be very opaque and it would wear off fast. Nope! This stuff is great.
B000TM19HC|5|They used this product with me while I was in the hospital.  Because of surgery I cannot get in a tub or shower so have to wash off the old time way with just a washcloth, towel and sink full of water.  Since this does not have to be rinsed off, it leave your feeling really clean and is gently on your skin.
B00EA5B2VW|5|I can polish my nails myself with the light color that I chose.  With regular manicures, my polish stays on about 3 days.  This polish stays on for 2 weeks.
B00IUISATM|5|A surprisingly true scent. It is for my daughters wedding day. For her memories of Hawaii she said she wanted to smell plumaria all day  Now she can.
B002L9Z9TK|4|I really like this product.  It helped heal my scar and i didn't have to use that much cream each time I applied it so I have some leftover.
B006IYU0U2|5|Does the job well!
B001G60J94|2|I thought perhaps it would help with my winter chapped hands. I was unimpressed with the results. It does not spread very easily and does not make my hands soft. sorry.
B00GR0EI9Q|5|I have less irritation with this product that with other razors. This razor also leaves my legs silky smooth and for a longer time period.
B00KU8FYN0|4|I have very fine hair and have to color every two weeks. My hair would be dry because of all the coloring. It's only been a month yet I've noticed my hair is not dry, slightly fuller, shinier, but mostly healthier. I will continue to use this shampoo in hopes that results continue. Very pleased :-)
B003V265QW|4|The product price is reasonable, the product is new. I have yet to learn how to style my hair as I like it. I am not used to a wand, but I am practicing. I think this will be perfect for summer hair styling.
B0050PNHBY|5|It's my first time purchasing an item from Amazon. It was a very easy process and the dryer arrived on time. The hair dryer exceeded all my expectation!I have very curly hair and I was able to blow dry it in less than 30 minutes. The hair dryer is light and of great quality. I have purchased lots of hair dryers and this one tops them all. Great product at a great price!
B004HLVI22|1|My old one lasted 10+ years and I trusted my history rather than the current reviews - my mistake.  Believe the reviews!  However good Rotadent was - they are no longer.  My &#34;new&#34; one is anemic - even after &#34;fully&#34; charging.  It does not hold a full charge for more than a couple of days.  So as soon as this one bites the dust (which won't be long!) I will try another brand.  Fool me once - shame on you....fool me twice - shame on me<br />Believe the Reviews!!
B001H99XYC|5|Great pricing and product.  The shipping was before time and work out great.  This is a must product.  It is great to use as a gloss single or on top of your favorite lipstick
B00NUE2ZSI|5|I love this nail polish duo because I can touch up my salon gel application in between trips! The color is fantastic. It will stay on forever. I've had the polish on my toes for about two weeks. The gel, when applied correctly, makes my nails shiny and hard. I am thankful that I have found LECHAT!
B002PMLGVI|4|Works pretty well.  Removed all the red from what should have not turned out to be dark reddish brown hair.  I do have faint gold highlights - which looks good, actually.  I could use another box.  It is very easy to use as the mixture becomes thick enough to not be drippy which makes the whole process simple and clean.  I did follow one reviewers advice and use the product for much longer than the ridiculous time of 5 minutes recommended by the instructions.  I used it for 40 minutes and that was just about right - especially for dark colored hair tint.  Have extremely sensitive skin and had zero trouble with the product, that is why I gave it four stars.  It isn't perfect, but very, very good with no hideous smell or side effects.  The conditioner that comes with the brass banisher is lovely and smells very nice.  Go for it.
B001F51V48|4|I enjoyed being a natural born blonde. Now my hair is a mix of gray, blonde, brown & blonde highlights. I find that this Pantene product really does keep my highlights brighter. I recommend it.
B00D1329BG|1|I am very disappointed! It does not remove any hair..... At all! I have faithfully used it and see no results.
B007IV5W5C|5|This product is excellent for conditioning and moisturizing the hair. The smell is also wonderful. I got this product to help with my split ends and so far I have been impressed.
B0009OAHVO|4|bien
B00BISJEFA|4|Like original Proraso, this cream creates outstanding lather...rich, slick and protective.  This formulation might even perform a little better than the green.  It leaves my face more moisturized after the shave.<br /><br />The fragrance, sans menthol, is milder than the green.  However, out of the tube it smells a little odd to me...almost like cocoa.  Once worked into a lather, and after the shave, it does smell more like sandalwood, though a mild fragrance.  Not bad, but a little disappointing to me.  This is my only complaint with this cream, but a very slight one.<br /><br />Overall, a very good shave cream.  A good buy and worth a try.
B0041NW66I|5|So far best nighttime moisturizer I've found that doesn't clog but works.
B004IBVW86|1|I had to remove this eye shadow base in order to put on my shadow! It matted and caked as I was applying it. Threw it out....
B00C7IHQAA|5|I was hesitant about buying this with no reviews.  But I've heard the Silver Fox brand is good so went ahead.  It exceeded my expectations with a solid steamer with metal case and a sturdy stand and lamp mount.  I also like the decorative covers on the mag lamp arm that covers the springs.  Looks and works great!
B001B4NBOQ|3|I usually love sandlewood essential oil, but this one barely smells of sandlewood. I feel as though their was way to much jojoba.
B00MR05DQ2|5|My first impression was thank goodness this isn't a thin gooey liquid. It is thick and rich, dries tightly and is everything I love in a mask.<br />I am very much a mask junkie, and when I saw &#34;whitening mask&#34; I knew I had to try it.  I've used some international beauty products from sub boxes because overseas they are said to be so much more advanced in their technologies- I always see whitening masks from Japan and Korea but they are much more expensive and I didn't (used to) know how it would work. I have been more than impressed with this. In recent years I have noticed dark spots around my mouth and from old blemishes that are more noticeable in pictures. I always have to use extra concealer and it is especially aggravating. Then I have to use bronzer on my neck and decollete because my face has permanently darkened from not using spf in my 20's! So, needless to say I was more than ready to put this to the test. I love that it is sealed with a plastic inner lid. I pull it by the tab and use the lid to smear it on the darkest spots first, then even it out. It spreads easily and has a nice consistency, almost that of a scrub. It clearly has a lot of great ingredients to help lighten the skin and by the time 15 minutes is up it is tight and ready to rinse. My skin feels great after rinsing and I like to use a cloth to wipe it off in a circular motion so it acts as an exfoliant as well. My facial tones are beginning to more closely resemble my neck area so that it isn't such a difference between the two when I wear lower cut tops. I'm so glad that by just using this a few times I can't see any noticeable darkness in around my mouth unless I'm looking for it. I don't think the areas are apparent to others at all and I'll continue to use this to help combat the effects of sun and dark makeup. I'm very excited to see how it helps the dark spots on other areas of my body as well.
B000G33KEO|5|My manicurist recommended this to me January of 2013. I followed the instructions and her orders faithfully.  When I had my first manicure (without polish) after 6 weeks, she felt she could see a difference in my nails.  By July they had all grown out and I am now getting a &#34;regular&#34; manicure every two weeks.. a manicure which used to last 2-3 days now goes 11 with dark colors, 13 with light colors. this has been an amazing transformation for me. my nails seem as strong as when i used to use acrylics.  they were great with a gel manicure but my nails were still paper thin.  The downside is this (and read it carefully).  When your nails are strong and grown out, you CANNOT stop using this or they will revert back to what they were..i made that mistake once.  and when i put it on over polish every other day, it takes about 5 minutes to dry vs 1 minute on bare nails.. I'm a convert.. it may not work for everyone but I&#34;ve gone from stumps to having to have my nails cut when I have a manicure!!!!
B000EPJNMW|5|Great compact design. Takes up very little room in your suitcase. Rollers heat up & are ready to use in about 2-3 minutes like the product claims. Sets hair better then most rollers (and I have tried many). The only thing that I would change, is to add 2-4 more rollers. But I liked these rollers so much, I actually bought a 2nd set & use these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers I own!!
B003M6WYW6|2|Its good for about a minute or so, then the overwhelming smell kicks in.  The cooling sensation is nice but the scent gave me a massive headache.
B004WSXD4G|5|I have been using this product for one month now.  I can definitely see a difference on the areas I am putting it on.  My skin is smoother, tighter and feels silky soft.  I was eager to try this product as I have read so many positive reviews on it.  You can't beat the price compared to other expensive cellulite creams.  I am a huge fan and will continue to use this product.  I highly recommend trying it!!!
B003NODFPM|2|Smelt great on ca friend but not me
B0002D5Y92|4|The product is good, I thought the light would help, not really. If you use the product every two weekks, the hairs are gone with little notice. Overall, Great product, light should be in the middle of the trimmer that outside the casing of the unit.
B000YRWD4A|5|I can't believe no one thought of this earlier! Putting nail polish in this format just makes more sense than using the current standard \\"format\\" (little glass bottle that spills so easy, separate brush).     This product is so easy to use - you just gently squeeze the plastic bottle and swipe it on. It goes on smoothly and dries SUPER quick. It's so easy to throw the bottle in your purse for touch ups or travel. You don't have to worry about the bottle breaking, or spilling an open bottle of nail polish. My only complaint would be the limited colors available in this format. In my opinion there is no need for the glass bottles at all anymore - all nail polish should come like this!
B00742JW8S|5|is perfect, but I really, it hurts a lot of pain, but the results are excellent, if anyone knows how to avoid pain tell me, I really need
B0002OCO8A|2|After reading many reviews on here about Canus and actually trying it myself, I had no idea that it was filled with lots of preservatives and chemicals. It tended to irrirate my skin so I took the advice of another reviewer and also tried WendyLou's and happy to say that her products are great and now my skin is soft. I would highly recommend anyone that wants a good quality soap or for that matter lotion they try Wendylous natural bath. It's comoforting knowing you are not using a bunch of chemcals on your body too.
B00JBCKQXO|5|I tried the first 30 day supply just to see how much growth would be added to my hair and it truly works
B0014P8L9W|3|Very nice but make my skin dry
B0039LMTHE|5|I like Mach 3 razors but I always run out of things like this and goes for days without stopping to pick them up. Now with Prime when I see I need something I just order from Amazon and it shows up at my house. They had a good price on these razor blades too.
B005N3KQW6|2|The curls look like a bad perm the minute your run your fingers through it and the cap was not tight enough and I have a big heard. I will say the color is gorgeous.
B002HWS7VS|5|I am an artist, an oil painter, and needed something better than an apron. This is just perfect!
B00C1JIKSW|5|We have used Surgeon's Secret for many years.  It heals crackes and cuts on hands as well as feet.  We highly recommend this product.  Try it once and you will be back for more.
B002F34UQ0|3|I'm using my husband's account to write this review. I ordered this product twice for myself. In between I used Lattisse. At my first try it was absolutely great: my lashes grew so long, they touched my sunglasses. I looked like I wore mascara. They also rarely fell out. The reason I tried Lattisse was that with StimuLashFusion I did develop red eye lids, so I hoped Lattisse would eliminate this. It helped with the redness, but my lashes thinned out and started to fall out. Since it was so expensive, I finished the bottle and ordered my second bottle of the Stimulash. This time it was very disappointing. My lids are red again and the lashes are half of what I had comparing to using the product first time around, hence my rating. I'm searching for a better product. So far I didn't find anything worth trying. I'm really reluctant to order the third bottle. 50/50 is not a good record. I did read that this brand is often falsified, so I wonder if and how Amazon checks the authenticity. As other reviewers said, the tube is not sealed, nor is the packaging when it comes... All looked the same twice I ordered ( I kept the first packaging and tube, and compered ingredients). I will keep reading and searching. Good luck to you!
B001DNE3KQ|4|I like it.Panasonic ES8103S Men's 3-Blade .It is suit for me.much better than other one.de.rserve you to use it,it is good
B003F4H49S|4|I'm 27 n started to notice summ forehead wrinkles n decided it was time for a new step .i had the sample there n placed it on one night and by early morning I felt my skin so supple and refresh I was amazed do for that I give 4 stars because the price totally kills it too much 💰
B00ET9DZCS|5|Good
B005MFKU8U|4|These are so much nicer than the thinner ones. They don't cut my gums and are more resistant to fraying.
B008P6AJ84|5|This is a very good product and I like it very much. Its very good priced and overall product quality.
B00F7QJFL2|5|This is absolutely the best skin firming cream on the market. It was recently improved, and what an improvement!! It has a wonderful feel, absorbs so well, and my skin is getting firmer every day. Buy it and you will be a very happy, thinner camper.
B000C1FARA|5|Arrived timely.  Well packed.  It was exactly what I needed.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for replacement parts for their razor.
B005MFKU8U|5|I can't tasted the mint flavor very well but these things are durable and work great!
B0013DF2BK|5|Love it, it's working fine.<br />Easy to use, i bought it for my sisterns and my friends
B000DT7FUQ|5|Bought this to keep at my computer since that's where I study the most. I needed something to wake me up and keep me focused. Smells great. I give it a quick shake and spray generally above my head whenever I need a pick me up. Would recommend.
B00AZUHKSK|3|Ring sizes need to be bigger or sets need to be offered in other sizes... These are great if your fingers are the size of a childs but if you want to wear these like I did without having them fall off you had better invest in some good nail glue otherwise these are going to fall right off.
B0009EILAS|5|This is a scent free solution for inexpensive body wash. This product is also good at keeping skin soft and moisturized for both sexes and any age. I highly recommend this product to the general public as an alternative to cheap scented products that give you a headache - use this instead.
B0000ZLEJG|5|Finding Egyptian Goddess Oil in a little shop in Jackson, Wyoming seemed appropriate. It's fresh and wild and deep and sweet and full of mystery... Being REALLY picky about scents,(I only wear two) I was possessed when this scent spoke to me and I knew I could not set it down. I ordered a case of it a week later. My husband LOVES it. My sister and her husband loved it so much I gave her some. It lasts the whole day, and changes throughout the day, always whispering \\"goddess\\" with its amazing empowering aroma. I get fantastic comments on it - and if you should order a bottle, and it is not for you, please find a friend to give it to.. they'll love you for it. This is an exceptional and timeless scent - I have been wearing it for almost 20 yrs - and it still possesses me.
B00G99TDR2|1|AWFUL!!
B00D0NLB52|5|fast shipment product exactly as shown
B00FKIVLNC|5|Works great!
B001QY8QXM|5|Fit perfectly in my double edged razor. I go through at least three shaves before I replace them. These can even last me all year! With the price, I feel like it's a steal.
B000UZEQJQ|5|It works great... It was a good buy for me
B007SNGSFS|5|I love the braun machine, already have the shaver and this refill work great are simple I´ll recommend you .
B000Q7CVDQ|4|Yeap....you'll want to plug these in at least half an hour bef0sore you need them. On the plus side, the case is HIGHLY portable and the rollers are easy to use. They can be used in different ways to create different kinds of curls: 80s big hair, 70s Farrah Fawcett flips, beach waves, and more!
B000Z65APY|5|Beautifully light scent. The perfect moisturizer.
B00JBCKQXO|2|Didn't work as well. As regular hair and skin vitamins
B00ATPZPCO|3|It's been 3 weeks, haven't noticed a difference, may be worse? Might be one of those cases where it gets worse before it gets better, if so, I will update.
B0037MQAE8|5|I've been using this for years and is easy to remove eye makeup without pulling on the eye. I tried the liquid removers but the remover pads have so many chemicals that end up in my eye and I have to use about 5 cotton pads per eye. This one never bothers my eye.
B00JZZJ336|5|LIP PRIMER IS A MUST WITH ALL NYX MATTE LIP CREAMS. IT MAKES THE LIP CREAM LAST LONGER AND MAKES MY LIPS SMOOTH AND MAKES THE COLOR POP.
B0046KHE1S|5|I originally purchased smaller bottles for lice prevention.  This product has natural ingredients and was the recommended shampoo from the lice treatment service we used.  The product smells great, lathers up really well and due to the ingredients, seems gentle enough to use every day.<br /><br />My kids use it every day and I use it periodically alternating with my normal color shampoo/conditioner.  We love it so we ordered the larger formats.
B003HLQVNE|5|I was not disappointed when I opened the package. Its is a beautiful color and is high quality. It does not chip easily and I would definitely buy it again.
B00LZWV100|5|great for chapped face from winter it soothes it and makes it feel better
B0027M7M28|5|Great color.
B000V1QTBM|5|my hair has near been in better condition since using this product
B00EXTV6AW|5|I need to order some more soon, this soap seems to be working.  Even without doing a lot of exercise my thighs seems to tighten.It just been a couple of weeks.
B005JZI01W|5|Smells great and my wavy hair has clean, not frizzy waves!  I let my hair dry naturally after using this and it looks fab!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review.
B001CJ693A|5|Just what I wanted
B00KQBR9FM|5|I am a Big Fan of Adovia product. I wish I can get all to try and get look younger with that unbelievable product. I got Adovia Eye Cream from Tomoson.com for my review. Company promise: “Your Eyes will Look 10 Years Younger, let your eyes shine again with their natural beauty, get rid of the wrinkles around your eyes and smooth out fine lines or Your Money Back!” Yoopy ! It’s what I want <br />Open jar, looks like a Vaseline but acting opposite. No greasiness and very quick absorptions. After my first application at night time, I felt a slight stinging of my upper lids just for few seconds, I was really scared that my eyes would be puffy at morning. No! I woke up with refreshing eyes, bright and younger looking.  At morning I had applied a very small amount with q-tips around eyes with memory of prior night of stinging, nothing occurred. My eye makeup lay very nice on that very extra light gel, no smudges during day.  The delicate skin around your eyes requires a special, gentler touch and Adovia delivers that with a combination of Dead Sea Water, Chamomile ,Algae Extract, Papaya Extract, Aloe Vera , Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose ,Peach kernel oil, Collagen and much more.  All incredible ingredients helping me every day getting my eyes to look more youthful and refreshed.  I got a few compliments from my coworkers about my new way to apply eye makeup and I told everyone that same technique but new eye cream that make my eyes looks brighter. Living in Florida I always look for something that will protect my skin from daily sun damages and Adovia eye cream helps with that goal with Vitamins A and C. Use of gel is very minimal, I believe jar will last very close to a year.<br />I have not noticed or feel any stinging after my first use.<br />Another Prefect product from Adovia.
B007PLQS4Y|4|Hayak has a mild, musky fragrance suitable for men. It has refreshing aroma with decent longevity. Comes in an ornate flacon.
B003D7L7OK|5|This is the best working deodorant.  It goes on nicely and doesn't get on my clothes.  Its clear, but not goopy.  I cannot find this product in the stores anymore, so I have to order it through Amazon.  I hope Right Guard doesn't stop making it.
B001OHSS9S|5|I've been using this product for years. Of course I choose whole foods over supplements but there are just times when I'm running out the door and need something that will get me through a couple hours. This is my favorite choice. It tastes great (will take getting used to if you have a nummy palate). Tastes best super cold. I usually blend about 1 scoop with 14 oz water and a couple ice cubes. I've found I prefer it pretty plain.
B000PI4J3G|1|This made my hair dry and I could not believe the tangles in it. I should take a picture. I have fine, oily hair that tangles very easy and this product actually made my hair worse. I bought this on a whim and I will probably never buy from this company again.
B00N996X4G|5|I am really liking this eye cream so far.  It doesn't irritate my eyes, which is something that is really important to me since my eyes are sensitive, and it doesn't have an odor.
B000K7AH1K|3|Aloe vera gel keeps more sweat away this this does.
B00OACMU7A|4|My step daughter loves this. Great Price. Would purchase again.
B002XQ1RBA|5|Got it for a friend and she got it real fast and loves it.
B008GOR6O0|5|Actually works well
B004SPUVMK|4|This works pretty good without burning your skin. It didn't take all the hair off but most of it. My lip was smooth after using it.
B000EGMBNY|4|This product does great if you are combating excessive shedding and breakage. I've been using it for a month now and my level of breakage and shedding had drastically decreased
B000VC7NCA|1|I suffer from MS and it has become very hard for me to wash my hair while in the shower so I was very excited to find this item.<br />First this item said 5/pk. Which I figured was incorrect due to the price so I purchased two. I am not sure what I am going to do with the one I still have left but I will NOT use it. After using this cap my hair was very greasy. It tangled and knotted non stop while brushing it after towel drying (as directed). As soon as I completed brushing a portion of my hair it would knot right back up - this has never happened to my hair before. There is also a smell to this product that I can't quite describe but as a female it is not at all what I would want my hair to smell like. It is not repulsive but it is not a clean smell either. I would strongly advise buying another no rinse cap.
B007M81B4W|4|i will continue using this product to maximize improvements for 6-12 months  i like to be $4bucks cheaper. lil bit for twice a day use in little tube.
B000V70MWS|5|Excellent seller. This is exactly what I wanted.
B00J4NHY76|4|I bought this leave-in conditioner along with the shampoo and conditioner. While I am not going to be continuing the use of the shampoo and conditioner due to my hair falling out, I am going to keep this and use it every once in a while. It makes my hair feel nice and soft, even when using it with other shampoos and conditioners.
B009QZ6L6W|5|Loved it! I'm so happy I'm getting another one as soon as mine is done! I love all of of oscar's prodcts!
B00E63N1M6|2|After prewash the curly wavy pattern did not return. I had to keep moistured cream with me at all time because it dried too fast.
B000VEMWB0|5|Best daily toner, my skin is glowing and smooth.  I use this on my face, décolleté and back. Works well with any skin care line.
B00SD8LTF6|5|Best pricing on the market for these particular blades, even when comparing it to the club stores.  The packaging is exceptional.  Easy out, no scissors needed.  Of course, I wish that blades in general were less expensive, but I have tried the off-price alternatives and haven't been satisfied.
B00AZ1TZ3W|4|Like all the products-- the fil freeze-- can see why they give you 2-- for the 1st one only lasted less than 2 weeks..overall  pleased with the products
B000YJ2SKM|5|This is a great product! I have rosacea, and it not dry out my face like other face cleanser!! Love it!!
B00KSPUN04|4|I like the texture and how it works for curls but the scent is really heavy
B00DA1WYQY|3|its not same :/ its all pink
B001Q58ZKK|1|This perfume does not smell at all like the original. I strongly believe it's an imitation. Also have in mind that's this product isn't eligible for returns
B002UUT43W|5|I have only got to use this one, so far I love it! I love the consistency. It doesn't feel heavy when applying, the serum leaves your legs feeling smooth. A little goes a long way.
B000CST4HA|5|This is the best product I have used to make my eyes look instantly terrific!  I am holding back on having an eye lift, and this stuff fits the bill. I look ten years younger in just three minutes after applying the serum. The price is great compared to other products that don't work anyway. I have bought five bottles in the past, and I will continue to use this product.
B00XTAFYKY|5|Excellent product. Amazing peed of delivery
B000050FDX|5|Excellent  item new in package. Great seller
B00GY2BELM|5|Great!
B00NOAKUBM|5|I waited to write the review because I got 3... Wanted to see how they worked...and I am VERY happy with my purchase!!
B00A3C3N5O|5|I really like what I got, but I am having problems using it.  I went on youtube to get some pointers on how to use it properly and I am sure with practice I will get it down.  The product itself is great!  It comes with a lot of different designs.  The scraper and stamper are adequate as well.  I am happy with this purchase and will be a stamping master in no time!
B007XX4USU|5|Excellent and as promised.
B000WW82Q0|5|This is hands down the BEST conditioner I have EVER used! Soft, silky, vibrant, volumized are only a few of the words I can use to describe what it does for my hair. This girl is ordering more!!
B000068PBT|5|These, according to my husband, do a great job with his electric razor.
B000URWZB0|5|Great for people who do karate or other barefoot sports. These are gentle enough to use daily. One side is a soft sponge full of soap--I use this to massage and lather up my feet. I turn it over to the coarser side, and use this to get all the dirt out and gently exfoliate. This won't get off all of the calluses, but I prefer that as I need to keep tough feet for karate.<br /><br />Be careful during the first few uses--the soap gets the shower floor very slippery and you need to keep a firm grip or risk a fall. If you have poor balance, I would recommend using while sitting down with a bucket of water or outside during the warmer months with a hose. The sponge lasts about a month for me with almost daily use. However, the soap side loses its massaging properties around 15 washes, but still contains enough soap to work up a good lather.
B0084BPHRI|1|Poor design too big
B000O5VKK0|5|My old Panasonic trimmer finally died after 10 years plus.  This new trimmer is quieter and so much sharper.  Trims really close without nicking the skin.  Very satisfied.  Ridiculessly cheap sale price at around ten bucks.
B003V21WO2|5|Was a gift, she loved it, works perfect
B004HSO124|4|These are great and arrived on time and exactly as described. You can create a lot of looks and they are very pretty colors.
B00BUYP69A|4|Nice product, exactly as advertised.
B000V8MTIC|4|I have had my product about 2 wks but havnt started seeing the hair growth yet... I still have faith hoping that it will work... I have been using it consistingly.
B001MA0QY2|5|I love it!  It works very well. I absolutely Love the glove that came with it. Great price! I bought one for me and one for my sister.
B00S59Z78S|5|I have lost weight and my neck was getting flabby looking.  Ordered the firming cream and have started using.  Like the cream so far.
B00ARF42D4|5|Didn't even clip one nut with this!
B0006HCE60|5|This oil is a highly concentrated source of Vitamin E.  I mix a couple of drops of it in the almond oil I use as a body moisturizer.  I've just put in an order for 2 more bottles (because I don't want to EVER run out).
B003T1G0XI|5|Love it!
B0014FC562|5|This shampoo is mild and lathers beautifully.  I have thick, fine, wavy hair and a strong shampoo leave my sensitive scalp itchy and my hair feeling like straw.  This shampoo leaves my hair quite silky and healthy feeling.
B001DLUA1Y|5|Great
B00FH5RD0S|3|I ordered this because supposedly it wouldn't make my hair greasy, well it did. Maybe I just have that kind of hair, IDK. Even though it made my hair greasy I actually like it, smells good, calms the frizz, and gives shine.
B003H3G470|3|This unit does a good job as long as you make several passes. The problem is the unit is totally useless after the plastic gear fails approximately 6 months of use.<br />I would tell everyone to not purchase this unit until they make a metal gear assembly for this.<br />Please make a metal gear assembly that is interchangeable with the current model.<br />Thanks,<br />miedstkr
B00EZX7S1W|5|I love these face masks! They are convenient and handy, they also make your skin very soft and smooth! I will be purchasing again. :)
B00ARF450E|3|dont like the way it turns on and off. i constantly wind up twisting it too far and opening up the machine completely. cuts fine, a bit weak though. (takes about two minutes to cut beard)
B001FKSCXG|2|Maybe Someone Will See It In My Collection And Want To Give It A Home.<br />Not For Me. I Like Patchouli. I Love Musk. No Idea What This Is :-\<br />I Do Not Recommend.
B00AQX87M4|3|I gave it a 3 star because it worked fairly well initially but got a little oily after a while.<br />It acts as a decent primer. worked better on my teenager.
B00A620JA8|1|It doesn't work that well
B00W5UZ30K|5|I received this product and was given a chance to review.  I love it.  Goes on easily feels fantastic on the skin.  My skin after felt smoother and cooler to the touch.  I am looking forward to using it again.  Mommy Daughter time this weekend sounds like a great chance. I would definitely recommend this product for your home spoil me kit.
B00HB2JQNM|5|good
B003V21WO2|5|I have long thick course Hair. It does the Job needed to smooth out my Frizz. Good price. Takes less time with the wider option.
B008NDVHTY|2|This doesn't work with any nail polish that has a shimmer or glitter to it. It also doesn't truly make it a matte look, it's more dull and just not the same. Save your money and buy true matte polish if you want that look.
B00OP25LBW|4|I tried this after trying the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Conditioner. The conditioner was lightly scented and left my hair feeling great. I am not as smitten with the shampoo, but it's still good. The shampoo's scent is much sweeter than the conditioner, and fruitier although they are supposed to have the same scent. Whereas the primary scent in the conditioner was supposed to be fig, but was actually mint (at least to my nose), it was quite nice and left no lingering scent to clash with other lotions or products. The shampoo scent is also supposed to be fig and does contain some peppermint oil, according to the ingredients, but it was generic fruity sweet to my nose, and lasted all day long. The shampoo did a fine job, my hair got squeaky clean. But I prefer the conditioner in this Herbal Essences team.
B001DKMY9Q|5|It works good and charges quickly. I have since updated it with another newer model that works even better but costs more.
B007RF1YZG|5|I love these whitening strips.  Perfect for those who don't have perfectly straight teeth. I highly recommend  this product.
B001PWKO9E|1|This polish is more green than blue and it stains your nails.<br />I had a hard time getting it off even with acetone<br />I would not use this product on human nails.
B002IMUL7U|4|This is the 3rd mirror I've bought. It's great for plucking eyebrows and such, especially great if you have something in your eye that you can feel but can't see in a regular mirror. Although I don't keep it turned over 5 minutes a day at the very most, and it's not every day that I use it, eventually the light bulbs burn out. I've tried to find replacement but at one website it stated &#34;the bulbs never burn out&#34;. Yes, they do- which is why I am on my 3rd mirror. But they do last about 1 1/2 to 2 years each so as long as amazon keeps selling them, I will keep buying them, because they really do come in handy.
B007VQI11G|5|Great scent I would recommend it
B0041HNVC2|5|Delivery was fast and it works great. Its look nice on the salon and Customer love it.  i love The dryer chair it is big and very confortable to seat on.
B004FQK7JE|2|The hairspray sent was in arisol cans, not in non arisol spray bottles. I'll use them, but I really wanted the non arisol spray bottle.
B00H8ZLVTE|5|I am an esthetician and have a daughter with cystic acne. I have been doing salycilic peels to so so results. I wanted to try the mandelic and thought this was perfect. After one treatment her skin looks so much better! I'm going to give some other products a try from this line.
B00IMHN0B4|5|I loved this stuff, it smells amazing and made my skin feel so soft and refreshed at the end of the day. You can use it straight out of the bottle as a very gentle toner, which is what I did for the first few days of use. And it was the perfect addition to my homemade toner recipe as well, which included witch hazel, tea tree oil, and hyalauronic acid. I would bathe in this stuff if the bottle was big enough for sure. You can add this product to pretty much anything, which is great for the DIYers like myself. I highly recommend this product and this company.    I received this free for review purposes, but all opinions expressed are my own and freely given.
B00GJCCH40|4|I recently got this product - likely for the same reasons as others, had heard Vitamin C serum is good to combat wrinkles and help with all the anti aging things.... skin getting more loose, etc.  I like that when I started using the serum, I could feel my skin tightening right away.  Not in a 'my skin is dry' kind of way but like it was firming back up.<br /><br />I use it on my face and neck/upper chest area and also still use my moisturizer.  I might start using it on the backs of my hands too, just to help ward off signs of aging there too!
B004UDTV58|5|Wife loves this item and will continue buying more.
B00D9NV2D4|5|Good quality, smooth and melts on contact.
B002URZZ42|5|my favorite handsoap of all time - I love coconut. My kids love it too because it makes good foam. It doesn't strip the skin.
B005GLZW8S|5|The crest pro health product line is a great product.<br />My teeth look and feel great- worth the extra money
B0012UX586|5|I never thought a hairbrush would make such a huge difference in blow drying my hair. I cut the time in half, and it did a great job!!! Hair had a smooth finish.
B009XRF9ZW|5|I love this product. I'm in the sun a lot and it gives good protection and looks great 😊
B008FPN92I|5|7 year old loves it
B0001TPR0S|2|Smells like lavender like the other two I bought of different calming scents.
B0000535W4|4|I chose Weleda brand items when I was shopping for my sons because I liked that I knew what all the ingredients were. I've been using this lotion on the babies and myself for 6 months, and I'm very pleased with it. It smells nice, soaks in quickly, and is mild enough for their sensitive baby skin. My only complaint is that it doesn't work on dry patches, so we have to use a separate cream on those areas.
B004YWGP7W|1|I didn't like they advertisied as they could pick your color out, I will next time buy one that I can pick my color out because the one that I received was ugly and the person I bought it for didn't like it.
B0009OAHCS|5|Excellent parfum. Excellent service.
B00LH1ZLAK|1|This wasn't very absorbent and very hard to put on. Didn't really fit a normal sized 13 yr old girl. I don't recommend.
B006GKHIHQ|5|thank you very much is exactly what is described in the information , I would give more than  stars and of curse I will bay whit you.
B000P20R6A|3|Excellent smell, even though it was leaking when I got it.
B00EP5YJ7G|5|Love this color
B0050IGL1Y|1|Edit: My wife had her face checked immediately after applying this product and was told that it had absolutely no SPF value, by her doctor. I will be complaining to Amazon about this product.  Not too bad, although it has a somewhat unusual chemical smell. One of the only products out there with higher SPF moisturizer. Calims to 'lighten skin' but I imagine that is merely a side effect of blocking sunlight.
B002GENWU8|5|It is damaging but the product does its job. I have brown extensions so I can try the color on before I out it in my hair. This product definitely lightened it. After washing the bleach out, I saw that the extensions(human hair) were a little damaged.  But other than that.  I am impressed with the product
B003YJAZZE|5|As a gift to farther, it looks nice.<br />- Auto clean, cool function<br />- charge dock, blue LED. Looks cool<br /><br />Not sure how is the shaving...
B00F5CUL8O|5|use it everyday
B0007M3Z5S|5|Just finished my first can of limes, and I'll buy it again - after I use up my four cans of Trumper's coconut shave cream!
B00HMUP4IY|5|First hair product in years that im actually pleased with. Ive tried dozens of products to get my hair silky and smooth without making it look greasy or weighing it down. goes on shiny and instantly nourishes hair and makes frizz vanish! love how there is 5 different ways to use the product!  i put it on at night before bed and after i get out of the shower. i have thick long hair but only need 1.5 small pumps to cover from my ears down;  for under $5 and the bottle being so large im happy to say this amazing product will last me months, if not years, with everyday use!
B007S9SEG8|2|It was in Arab!
B00H5NR5EE|5|Heats very quickly. If I turn it on then give my 4 week old a bath it is ready to go by the time I am done, and her bath is a max 5 mins long as all I do is wash her hair and pour warm water over her. It is the perfect temperature, not too hot. Would buy again!
B005Y6F4WO|3|I already did a review on this. No other comment, No Comment Come on people  I dont  understand it because did not receive instructions with it.
B00117F5PG|4|I read the data about using a dermaroller to help with skin care. Also known as \\"microneedle skin care.\\" The dermaroller company suggest an intense serum with Vitamin E and C to be used after microneedling. The needle system allows more product to absorbed into the skin, therefore you will see better results. They also say not to use anything that is not in a pump as it will become unstabalized. This fit the bill. While using the derma roller I use EMU oil to keep infection down, and then wash my face with antibacterial soap. You only have about 10 min to get the concentrated facial serum on your face before your face pores begin to close up. So after I wash with antibacterial soap, I run the derma roller over my face again, and put on the serum. The lines around my eyes have literally disappeared. The lines around the top of my lips are diminished by 50% and the deep lines are now barely noticable. I am a 54, white female, with oily skin on my forhead and dry skin on my cheeks and eyes. I am going to order another bottle.
B00FJLLUP4|2|Fast shipping. Nicely packaged. This product seems iffy since the smell of the cologne doesn't stay on for too long. My husband sprays it on in the morning before leaving for work, and within an hour it's gone. He isn't happy about this at all as he has bought this product several times before at the mall, and has never had this issue until now
B009TB5VRI|5|This is EXACTLY what I needed, it has changed my daily life!  I have back problems (spinal stenosis) and can't stand or walk for more than a minute or so.  It was impossible for me to get around the house to do my chores.  Then I got this stool, and it is perfect!  I easily scoot along the kitchen cooking and cleaning; use it to pick up through the living room; etc.  I can do everything again, with no pain!  I was afraid that at this (very reasonable) price (I'd shopped around everywhere) the stool would be flimsy or unreliable, but no, it's just perfect.  It's solid, sturdy, supports over 200 lbs. no problem.  The seat is soft and cushioned, the wheels roll smoothly with no hesitation.  I am happy every day that I have it!  Really nice and prompt customer service too.  Puts together in a minute.  HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!
B00JAOUJ4E|4|It lasts and lathers nice.  Wish it smelled more coconutty.
B0060ALFW6|5|I have always liked using nail polish colors that will go with my outfits.  I loved the Fresh Frog of Bell Air OPI nail color.  It goes perfectly with a great number of my outfits.  I am very picky about green nail polish and this shade was absolutely perfect since it not ony looked great with my green outfits but outfits of other colors as well.  It went on easy and was easy to maintain.  I highly recommend Fresh Frog of Bell Air if you are looking for a good shade of green nail polish.
B00IDWP4IA|4|I have been using the Vitamin C serum for a frw weeks now and I can definitely tell around my nose and.mouth that the fines.lines from just weight loss, age, amd stress have almost diminished!
B0009L5Z32|2|Steer clear of this product if you have significant fragrance sensitivities, if you use only truly natural products, and if you must therefore return the item!<br /><br />While the product is touted as being natural and lightly scented, it is neither. The very potent 'almond' scent of the product made us ill, whereas genuinely natural & pure almond fragrance does not.<br /><br />We returned the product, per the vendor's enclosed return instructions, which stated that postage-paid return shipping costs to be deducted from our refund would only be $5-$6. But to add insult to injury, we just received our piddly $11.05 refund. So of the $25.13 we originally invested in this item, we lost $14.08, more than half of what we paid for it! Our time & money would have been better spent in giving the soap away from the nearest street corner instead.<br /><br />Live & learn from our sad tale. As for us, we will never patronize this company again.
B000U0F9GA|5|This mirror is just what I needed for putting on my makeup.  The light is even around the mirror and is just the right brightness for me.  The magnification is perfect for my aging eyes.
B00FPTPU7Y|4|I give it four stars because it leaks a little. Scent lasts a good while, but at the edges of the perfume when i spray it on me it leaks.
B006ENI4AA|5|Beautiful color
B0009DY8F6|1|I had a horrible experience - not only is this product NOT FREE, but they do not tell you up front that you should not use it while pregnant or breasfeeding.  I got the product and read the bottle, only to find out about this.  I then had to return it.  So the whole thing cost me valuable time plus the money for shipping to me and to return.  Most important was my time - it was a hassle.  AND to add insult the people were completely rude and I got the line about being the only one in the department too.  They must get lots of complaints like this because they seem to have it down pat.
B00QH13OX6|5|I am so excited to be able to purchase this on Amazon now. This is hands down the best therapeutic lotion that I have ever used.
B00EA5AWR2|5|I love this polish.  It is an expensive polish, but well worth it.  I can polish my nails at home, they dry in 8 MINUTES!!  And they last for about a week.
B00L2REOC0|4|Better than as expected.
B00068A0AQ|5|Exactly what I wanted and delivered right on schedule
B00AXXHCLY|4|Is as advertised. Good comb. Doesn't smell good right away, took a few hours to offgas (presumably the glue) until the sandalwood aroma made its way through. I would recommend oiling it with arganoil or EVOO, something thats fine to have in your hair.
B00V954IYY|5|Great hair brush!  Simple design is what drew me to choose this product.  Feels like a massage when brushing.
B000A7W5DI|5|The brush works very well. My whole family is happy with it.  I bought two sets for the family.  Each has been working just fine for the past month. Also, the brush heads are designed so that it reaches the rear teeth more effectively. I am very happy with the purchase.
B008LQTTIO|5|Perfect size, very fashionable, all of my things fit just right, came in many colors ,couldn't decide so I bought the all!
B000WZQZG6|3|ok not the scent I was expecting - a bit stronger and more flowery but still use it now and then
B000CPIMNA|5|The product arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. I use this as a deep conditioner and I'm very pleased with the results. After shampooing, I squeeze all the water out of my hair, then apply a generous amount of the conditioner, cover my head with a shower cap, and use a blow dryer to apply heat. After about five minutes, I rinse it out. It leaves my hair soft and free of tangles. Even after I let my hair air dry, it is much more softer and smoother, and it feels very moisturized. This is one of my favorite products so far. It really does provide moisture for dry hair.
B00DTTYF6E|5|Extremely happy with this moisturizer. A small amount goes a long way in making my skin feel smooth and soft.
B003FBI9LS|5|I'm very happy about this waver -- it heats up quickly and does the job. I have long, straight, coarse hair, and I have no trouble getting beautiful waves that stay for a couple of days, even without product in my hair! I'm not shy about spending money on beauty products, but you don't have to do so with this waver. Great deal.
B007F17NMA|5|I love this stuff - love all of Kevin Murphy products.  I usually buy them at my hair salon.  This was a little runnier than what I expected - the ones I get at the salon are quite thick.
B002UKP1AM|5|Product works great!! Lighting fast on warming up! Recieved item with super fast shipping! I was a little nervous buying this because I've always used a chi, but this item works just as good and warms up faster and does the job with the fraction of the price! :)
B00HCA8IUU|4|Little snug.
B00BPBLMCS|1|I was so excited when I got this. After using this I got razor burns on my body. It's so horrible. Please think twice before buying this.
B001P24STG|5|Love it.  I read all the other reviews and agree.  My hair actually looks weightless after I use it...as if I'm walking around underwater.
B004G2BROQ|1|Your description has nothing to do with your product.
B007746AXS|5|I really like the foot gel and use it on a regular basis.
B00HZ3LX3I|4|The Garnier cleansing oil makes my dry skin feel really soft after using it to remove makeup. Does a great job removing mascara and eyeliner! The oil's fragrance is really nice, and not overpowering. Would recommend for dry skin only.
B00SKQFT4I|1|quit working after 2 months!!!
B001ET7FGS|5|This body wash is so refreshing the fragrance of this makes you smell so great and clean your body too. Great product.
B000GGJCDY|1|Not what I expected.  I thought I was ordering regular flossers.  This is actually some kind of specialized product for people with bridges, ect.
B00RUNZMTE|2|It was a nice primer  but it broke on me in a month. I only ever used it twice.
B00028NL6A|5|Love this shampoo.  It has not fragrance which i am allergy too.  I can not see how one can wear shampoo that smell the body splash, them perfume , makeup and their clothes washed in smell stuff.  People do not realize that all the combine smell just makes you stink does not smell pretty.  pick one smell and stick with it.
B004QWRCWM|5|Wife loves it
B000P9DRZQ|2|I have a bottle of this on my nightstand because I'm trying to use it up as soon as possible.  I put it on my hands and arms every night before I go to sleep, and I swear I wake up drier than before I put it on.  I'm too cheap to throw it away, but I can't wait until it's gone!
B00J41G686|5|I am not very good at describing scents, so please grant me some leeway here. This stuff smells like someone added just a dash of a light bay rum to a big frosty glass of orange juice, strained it through some cedar chips, and added just the perfect amount of menthol to the brew. The menthol lasts about 20-30 minutes, which is just enough to soothe your mug after scraping hair off it. The remaining scent(orangey/old spicy)hangs around for a few hours until settling into a pleasant light orange that can be detected all day. This is the second Fine product I have tried, and I'm using both of them at twice the rate I do any other after shave. These are the best on the market in my humble opinion.
B003A2WYIG|5|The men seem to like it I like it so it is a win win for me.<br /><br />I like the scent it gives off it seems to get me noticed. That is the bottom line is it not??
B00GNA9KKM|5|the best brushes I have bought! Glad that they are eco friendly.
B0000UTUS8|1|I needed to replace my twisty turban that had worn out, and decided to go with this one based on the good reviews. First, I don't notice my hair being any drier after taking this off, it doesn't seem absorbent at all. Second, due to the tight elastic, my hair has started breaking at the hair line due to wearing this. Now I have a bunch of little wisps of hair that stick up! Third, I don't like that the loop is a rope instead of elastic, it makes it difficult to latch to the button.
B003CTTZQQ|5|My hair loves this stuff especially during the cold winter months. It arrived well wrapped and packaged to avoid any accidents.
B00ACSOAOM|5|This mask leaves skin feeling smoother than a baby's bottom and it smells like heaven. The additional benefit is that is made in the U.S. So I feel good knowing that I am supporting a local company out of Texas.
B001EPH3J6|5|Again what can I say other than Laura products are the best. I recommend one to try this line of products.
B00N312D9E|4|This is a small to medium size makeup/accessory bag.  Very colorful.  Seems to be well made and easy to clean.
B00GFBWWWC|5|Since using this product for about a month now, I am noticing that my skin looks much more fresh and vibrant and I am getting a bit of a glow :) The change I noticed most is how it reduces the appearance of my pores. I have always had large pores and this is really helping!
B00NVVHHU6|3|It was an OK color.
B002U8L18K|2|Didn't work for my nails at all!
B000Q43RNW|5|My husband has been using this oil for years and now that I'm a cashier he has started using it on my feet at night. I was glad to find i could order it from the same company I got my other things.
B000C1Z7U0|5|I have bought this for my mother several times. When she's done with one bottle, she asks me to buy it for her again. Smell is floral, subtle and delicate. The price can't be beat.
B00EEBD0SK|5|I LOVE CURLFORMERS AND SOMEHOW I BROKE THE HOOK THAT CAME WITH MY SET BUT THIS ONE WORKS GREAT AND ITS A BETTER QUALITY AND WILL LAST LONGER
B002D4JABQ|4|this is something I put on at night, its pretty thick but in the morning my lips are a lot less chapped. I know use it a couple of times a week, glad I made the purchase.
B002N3MMWQ|5|I ran out of this product and could no longer get it at Ulta.  I was crestfallen until I was lucky enough to find it online.  The product is great, especially for fine hair.  I can't be without it.  The product was delivered promptly and I was very pleased since I needed it yesterday.
B00413MF6Y|2|I purchased this product for my sister for Christmas because the other company I purchased Lilac products from does not make that sent anymore.  My sister said this product was not as rich and of good quality like the other brand.
B00SSROIHS|1|horrible quality. lasted half a day before it was a mangled mess. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM NOT EVEN CAPABLE OF SURVIVING A ONE TIME GENTLE USE NOT TO MENTION IT IS ALL DIFFERENT LENGTHS
B007Q0WW0S|5|it is a great product for my hair. look shine and healthy and not oily and no frizz.definitively i recommend
B0058E3XJI|5|I'm a dude and I occasionally use a tanning bed just to keep my tan consistent because I work a lot during the days. It sucks to build up a nice tan outdoors and then lose it because you can't get outside during the day. This cures that problem. I tan moderately and within the first 3 trips, I already had an awesome tan. It smells good, not too strong and it doesn't leave your skin feeling all sticky like other lotions do. It gives you an outdoor-looking tan, not orange. Good price and it's a hefty amount which will last me a long time no more than I use a tanning bed.
B001A40M1M|5|Very helpful for dry mouth.
B000TAJO5S|3|Great product!!!  Wish the papers were a bit thicker though.  Doesn't remove or smudge make-up!  I will definitely purchase again, and yes recommend the product!!
B0017SE1J0|5|This spray  smell so good , it is no fake , it keeps the smell during the whole day. Great!
B001VD8DDG|3|Overall it's an alright brush shampoo. It's not that great at cleaning off foundation on brushes and doesn't get the color off. I tried washing my foundation brush 3 times and there was still foundation residue. It's also really really runny. Right when you open it the shampoo all just comes spilling out, you don't need to squeeze it at all so just be aware of that.  It did do an alright job on my other brushes (powder, eye shadow, etc.) But in my opinion there are a lot better brush cleansers out there, even dish soap mixed with olive oil works much better than this..I don't think I will be buying this again.
B001MA0QY2|5|I have very course, wavy, hair and it takes a lot of heat to straighten it. The HSI ceramic flat iron works great.  I haven't had it long, but so far, it has cut my straightening time in half.
B003F8QNNC|5|I've been using this one for over 7 years, its the best.  It has the staying power of other waterproof mascaras but is so easy to remove and doesn't bother my contacts.
B00B5HJ5XU|5|Great
B006TZMW4C|5|Love the cologne Use it everyday and everyone else loves it awesome, great Wonderful  stuff smells great dont know what else to say
B008AIXTKC|5|Perfect transaction. Very happy
B00CQ6N9OU|5|I have roseacea and do not want to take a daily pill to control it so I have looked for and used many products to help. This is one of the best I have tried. I used it twice daily for about 3 weeks until it was under control. Now I use it as needed.
B000RL2W0I|1|Yuck. Not the best tasting gum.
B002PMOKI4|5|I've been using this product for a few years now, and for me and my mouse-brown hair, it works well and looks pretty natural as a high-light.
B00TKK27P2|5|I personally get puffy eyes and dark circles very often and I always look for a reliable puffy eyes product. I have tried some eye cream products from some American chain stores. They're either not working or irritate my eyes. My sister ordered this online and she lend it to me just to try it to see if it works for me. It turns out great and I am happy with the result. I have no allergic reaction to this eye cream and it really lighten my dark circles. I might purchase one for my own soon.
B008S6INZC|5|This was a great purchase! Does exactly what I wanted and I am very pleased! Definitely something you have to learn to do but all in all worth the time of doing it. Curls come out perfectly! Just beware because it does get super hot!
B0068OU494|5|great product- loved I!
B004RPRQCY|5|I've always had dark circles and eyebags under my eyes, a genetic problem, im only in my twenties..never used an eye cream before..since the appearance of my dark circles was getting worse, had to do something about it, after some intense reasearch I ordered this. It started working from the first application!!! Only been using for 3 days but already dark circles have reduced a must buy for smoother and brighter skin undereye!!
B008LP887S|5|Great lotion w/o any smelly sense.
B0014BF8TC|5|The Anastasia Stencils are awesome. I would highly recommend them for anyone who would like to have perfect eye brows.
B0018C3V5A|4|I actually got this dryer because my stylist used it and I was surprised at how fast she could blow out my hair.  It's very windy which is great for those mornings when I'm in a rush to get to work, I can rough-dry my hair in 2-3 minutes or do an at-home blowout in about 15 minutes if I'm not so pressed for time.  The only negative I've encountered so far is that because of the switch placement, I sometimes accidentally change the temperature/power in the middle of drying.
B003VSK9UE|5|Great product and fast delivery.
B000U0K64A|5|This is such a terrific product I cannot imagine why it is being discontinued.  I have a mild case of psoriasis and the Cocoa Butter is the ONLY over the counter product(of all those that I have tried) to keep it under control.  Living in the mountains of Colorado where the humidity is very low only serves to aggrevate dry skin conditions and Cocoa Butter is a savior!
B008XWUIRW|5|great
B000NJHOGG|3|What was unclear to me before ordering this is the design. The black lines you see halfway down the sides are pockets, which I understood before I ordered. However, I assumed the side pockets were the full length of each side with the openings just placed halfway. This is not so, the side pockets are just the lower half of the &#34;briefcase.&#34; I guess if you need to put something bigger than the height of the side pocket, it just has to go into the middle, unsecured. I have a similarly sized makeup organizer by Con***ts that does have side pockets with opening zippers about halfway down but where the pockets are the full length of the case. With this bag, expect all your contents to be in the bottom half of the bag and no real usable storage space above the zippers halfway down. Not terrible, just not terribly useful. The vinyl is a decent thickness, I would not expect it to puncture or rip with  regular use. Zippers are not great, I had one come off almost immediately but I was able to get it back on the tracks with a little work. I would not order this again nor would I recommend for storing anything other than maybe paper and pencils. For everything else, there are better products out there. I just wish I had chosen the &#34;City Lights Carry-All Make Up Bag, Large, Clear&#34; from this seller as I think it would serve my purposes better.
B00H2DWW2C|1|The opening is much too small and I can't get all of my eyelashes through it.
B001ECQ58E|5|I have been using Secret or Degree clinical strength deodarant. The deal Amazon had on Dove was awesome. It costs $9 in a store. I use it more often, but the price is great
B002WUACKE|5|Exactly What I needed to poke all those holes in my head without spending to much money.
B0018ZWPZ4|4|HAVEN'T NOTICED THAT THIS WORKS INTENSELY FAST.  HOWEVER, GIVING IT A CHANCE.  HAVE NOT HAD THE PRODUCT VERY LONG AND ONLY USED TWICE.
B00N5O0T2M|3|taste good, but there is bits of &#34;plastic like&#34; pieces in the turkish delight, that is un chewable
B00LNOV8JO|4|Light smell just started using it that's y no 5stars yet..but I can tell it helps your skin look youthful ... Oily skin like mines don't need much
B00ARM4Q7O|3|Didn't really do anything for me.
B00A48VH2S|1|My infant had clogged tear ducts and I thought this would help. Instead it made him scream and cry like it burned. He didn't have inflammation either. Pediatrician said to stick with a warm wet washcloth often and massage! Which worked.
B000NKHI2A|5|This is one of my favorite fragrances in the world! This body mist was unavailable for quite some time, but thankfully it came back out, so I bought 6 bottles of it.  I will be ordering this forever, no joke, that's how much I love it!  My teenage son, my husband, as well as my 20's stepson frequently compliment me on the smell, and ladies, these are GUYS!!  GUYS Love it too!!  It has such a &#34;clean&#34; smell to it, I could literally bathe in it, given the opportunity.  I wish someone would come out with it as a cologne...a long lasting cologne, I would stock up on that as well!! If you order it, don't buy them out, cause I will be needing more shortly down the road! Lol
B00GOCUEKE|5|Great shampooo! Helps keep cpolor longer and hair is soft and healthy looking!
B003ZVYQRY|2|VERY MUSKY!!! But its not terrible for others I can tell, just not for me. I don't like how hippie it is maybe if it were a little less potent.But its different on everyone.
B0049LUI9O|5|I like the rinse feature after use. Have not owned long enough to comment on battery life. Product seems to trim with the best of them. Pleased with purchase.
B00PRBAP9S|5|I do love it I just wish I could get it in the store near my home
B00HKIJHGI|3|Cute necklace for a young girl.  The chain doesn't look to be very good quality.  Does appear to be vintage.
B00AVLRC8G|4|One of the bottles leaked during shipping and all the bottles were covered in soap
B00L329W2Q|1|The veil is not the veil from the picture!
B00DSOI73W|5|This is my second purchase of this. I bought it hoping it would help with rosacea (which it did to a degree). I would up getting medication for the rosacea but re-purchased the soap just because I like it. It reduces the dreaded arm bumps and doesn't overdry my face. Sure, it doesn't smell like the chemically flavored soaps I'm used to but it's a mild smell that doesn't linger. It also lasts forever if you keep it dry in between uses. I keep mine in the shower so I leave it in a travel soap container. And if you're not sure, they sell a one pack product so maybe try that out first.
B001MA0QY2|5|I LOVE this flat iron! The quality is excellent and it is also an amazing value! If you are in the market for a flat iron, I highly recommend this one! It is great!!!
B002UB3H7K|1|The mirror is a great design. It's energy saving and fully portable with batteries lasting a year or two. Unfortunately, there is a serious quality control problem with manufacturing. The on/off/rheostat worked with a LOT of play for two or three days and then stopped connecting. The sealed environment makes user repairs impossible. I'm exchanging and hopeful that the next product will go through quality control.
B0018BVA4A|5|I ordered this several months ago and I still have not ran out of this cleanser.  I do my nails once a week (gel polish changes) and it suits this habit nicely.  The price was excellent and I have enough on hand to keep me going for a few months.
B006SVCY6I|4|Great variety of brushes, can't beat it for the price. Some of the brushes aren't as soft as the others and those same brushes do have bristles that fall out often, but you get what you pay for. Overall a good purchase. Make sure you buy brush sleeves/ guards/ sheaths and a brush cleaner/ shampoo.
B0015HHZ2I|5|My doctor recommended them and I use them faithfully.  I don.t know what more to say about them.  great help.
B00JPN6QCY|5|Great product
B00BOK0OKG|4|yes it ok
B004O9EKF4|5|It's a lot lighter than what the bottle looks like. It's a very sheer pale pink with a bit of glitter sparkles. Great for a polished look. Will last a while with out easy chipping or streaking. I'm going to get a couple more since I use it so much.
B00AE07H0M|3|I've been using it for two months now.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Smell isn't overpowering.<br /><br />The elixir is lightweight and doesn't weigh my hair down.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Doesn't do much to protect my hair against frizz.<br /><br />I would most likely NOT purchase this product in the future.  Nonetheless, the Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Conditioner and Shampoo are ideal.  Just a bit expensive for my taste.
B007UUE824|5|I love this product. I have curly hair and tried all kinds of products that my hair was so damaged. I was desperate to try anything. I have been using this product for 3 weeks. So Far this is the product I have longed for. It leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy. I have also tried it for couple of days in the humid, so far it has been excellent!!!! I love that it is natural and very light on my hair. Thank you and thank you. I also have ordered couple of other products from the seller. I have not tried them but will review them once used for couple of weeks!!!
B00CUG273A|5|My favorite toothbrush.  Bought another name  brand because it was on sale, but the bristles were too hard and brushing was uncomfortable.  Purchased the sonicare the same day I used the other brand.  This will be my only choice in toothbrushes.
B001JK4CAY|4|I hope the product works as described.  I bought it primarily for UV protection.  So far so good but the scent is not to my liking.  I can't describe it but to me it's a mix between men's BO and a musky cologne to cover it up.
B00J6L7HAA|5|when I got the chance to try out these tweezers I was very excited.  First thing I noticed when it first got here was how adorable the container they came in.  I could think of so many things for this container but unfortunately when it came hubby gave me the tweezers and took the container to carry him toothpicks in.lol so I guess he found a use.<br />  The tweezers were not only adorable but very well made.  They are very strong and very easy to use.  They really helped me get those little tinny hairs that are usually very hard to get a hold of.  They just grabbed a hold of them and yanked them right out.  There tip was a little sharper and angled so they just grabbed the hairs right away.
B002LZV95C|5|I get swollen tonsils about twice a year. Occasional tonsiliths (tonsil stones). This is only thing I've found that provides relief. I was thinking tonsillectomy till my friend turned me onto this. You just dust it on your tonsils (tricky till you get the hang of holding your breath while pointing tip of bottle at back if throat) and it numbs them for at least an hour. Much less irritating to tongue then cough drops. If you have recurrent sore throat bouts do yourself a favor and try this. Also great for general mouth sores. The stuff is amazing.
B00006L9LP|5|CLEANS TEETH VERY WELL AND HELPS TO PROTECT THEM IN THE LONG RUN. ALSO HAS CAVITY PROTECTION AND PROTECTS THE ENAMEL
B003NZXJP2|1|Do not buy this brush if you are looking to get the quality of the real bare minerals/escentuals brushes.  This is a knock off.  The bristles are rough, and the applications is not good.  I bought this thinking I was getting a good deal for 'the real thing', but these brushes are no better than what you would get for $2 at a Walgreens.
B000052Z9C|5|The pump was the incorrect size on the container of Vitabath.  Fortunately I had a container made by the same container company (how often does that happen?) for a shampoo and by cutting the tube to fit,  it worked perfectly.  The pump's tube on the Vitabath was too narrow for the thick gel to pump up.  Vitabath is an excellent product.
B00E4OEJNW|5|I'm very impressed with this stuff. The coverage is perfect, not too thick. The price can't be beat. Usually Lumene products are a lot more expensive.
B00450OEIU|5|Bath and Body Works carries many great products but this is by far my favorite!  The Orange-Ginger mix is fresh and feminine smelling without being sickly sweet or overpowering.
B003KWTJ20|5|Expensive, but there is no better blade.
B005OWO1RW|5|The colors are highly pigmented and thy didn't crease as the day passed. I plan to purchase the other compacts soon.
B00M1BPL5A|4|//Edit<br />I've had these rollers for almost two weeks now and I've been using them daily or at least every other day. All of the pros I listed below I still believe are true, however after experimenting with these for some time, I think the few cons out weigh the pros. I really wish it came with more rollers or if we have the option to buy more rollers because 12 rollers barely cover my whole head. If I put too much hair in one roller, the curl will not take at all. If I stick with small sections, the curls do come out beautiful, but it takes 2x longer to curl my whole head with these rollers because I have to wait until one side cools, unroll them and pop them back into the heater and then use them on the other half of my head--this is just not very practical for me because I'm looking for a less damaging way to curl my hair quickly in the mornings before I have to leave. The other con that is changing my mind about these hot rollers is that the curls do not last long at all. The curls take better on freshly washed hair and with some styling/curl activating product in it, but for me the curls still fell limp at the end of my days. These rollers do not work on second day hair very well. My hair fell limp within an hour after removing the hot rollers. I really wanted to love this product and keep it because these hot rollers are the easiest and most practical hot rollers I've ever tried. I was in love with these rollers the first time I tried them because I couldn't believe how easy and quick it was to roll into my hair and I thought it would be so perfect in the mornings but the more I put them to the test, the more I'm starting to regret my purchase. I still do prefer these over the other traditional hot rollers, but because they're not working out for me in the way I intended them to, I'm debating whether or not I want to keep these hot rollers.<br />//end of edit<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Fast heat up, about 2 minutes<br />- Significantly easier to roll into your hair than traditional hot rollers<br />- They get hot but not too hot where you will burn yourself<br />- NO CLIPS OR PINS = NO CREASES<br />- They do not feel heavy at all when they're sitting on your head (some traditional rollers are heavy and HOT and can burn my scalp)<br />- Took me about 5-7 minutes to pop all 12 rollers in my hair - very fast and easy for busy mornings<br />- Cools down in about 15-20 minutes<br />- Curls come out soft, bouncy and voluminous (I have asian fine hair). Out of all the times I've been using these rollers, my hair does not come out as curly or ringlet-like as it shows in the pictures/video. They come out looser and more natural looking.<br />- I really like how these don't make my hair feel damaged or dry at all<br />- Compact and easy to store<br /><br />There are two cons I have for these rollers.<br />1. A lot of hair cannot fit into 1 roller so if you have thicker hair, 12 rollers probably will not cover your whole head.<br />2. On my fine asian hair, I feel like the curls do not hold for long even with a strong hold hair spray. After maybe 6 hours my hair just looks like it has some wave and body to it but no more curls.

B00FEZLRX0|5|Absolutely love this! If you can be patient enough for it to get to you (it took about 3 weeks) it's great! It does have a chemical smell right out of the package but that's to be expected from the dye.
B00UM9ZTS2|2|The tweezers do not grip well.  Very disappointed in this purchase and do not recommend the product
B004D267JO|5|I was nervous because I have sensitive skin but first night I could see the difference.  I only use it every other night right now.
B006GQYSC8|5|I have a small mole on my face and regular razors cut it. I used clippers to cut my growth for 15 years. My wife convinced me to try this and it shaves so smooth. No pulling or cutting. Charges quickly  this product got here quickly and is worth the money.
B0036D8226|5|works fine
B00028QF9U|5|I have used this product for years and it is great.<br />It does not stain clothes or have any scent.<br />It works well.<br />I think it is best when put on right out of the shower and applied before you are completely dry<br />Also - it last over 2 years with daily use.
B00JE1V98S|5|Came sooner then expected.  Very nice looking!
B0083KYVMC|5|great stuff
B00ADCZG5E|5|My 13 y/o had a black light birthday party and this lipstick was a hit! It definitely glows!! She did not have to use a lot to make it glow! Such a fun lipstick!
B0058SY1X6|5|Product was exactly as describe. I give this as a gift to a friend thats is learning barber hair cuts, and he love it!! plus amazon made speedy delivery A+++<br />i do recommend tis product.
B002E7HG04|5|The service was great through Amazon,very fast and you get what you ordered without any problems!!
B00IAZHTWE|3|Was smaller then I expected my fault should have read measurements,however it is really nice not cheap At all.
B00FZ3WRGW|5|Looking for these for my mom.  She is going through chemo and has lost her hair.  She wanted something comfortable and breathable, for under her wigs.  These fit the bill!
B00A1UQB4S|4|Very pretty!! Just wish it was a little longer.
B0050HO9MI|1|not worth it.  VERY cheaply made!!!!
B003CEA88U|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT LOVE IT,
B003TBYW74|5|Definitely helped smoothen a scar after wrist surgery.  The scar is still healing, but it's flat and not dry.  Package arrived fast.
B00NAW73O6|4|I really like this set, especially the brow brush, but the powder brush is useless. If you are buying with emphasis on the powder brush, I would go with a different set. If you need a basic variety of eye brushes, then it is great, with a bonus nice blush brush.
B000VR6IX0|3|Love the smell but I was hoping for a something a little more natural... After using it for a couple of weeks now it isn't very conditioning... bottle came dented etc... But for the price I can't  really complain
B005SBCNHE|5|It makes my skin feel smooth, not sticky. My friend in New Mexico sent me some to try and I liked it, and ordered it.
B00028NKCU|5|After trying many brands of soap I settled on this one a few years ago and this is the only hand soap I buy now.  It's gentle, non-drying, truly scent-free and NOT antibacterial.  It's really hard to find this combination.  All liquid soaps nowadays seem to be antibacterial, even though the medical community warns against using such soaps, because they a) kill the good bacteria on our hands as well as the bad ones, and b) tend to breed antibiotic-resistant strands of the same bacteria the soap is supposed to kill.<br /><br />Another plus for me is that this soap doesn't have a lotion component many other soaps do and so washes off cleanly from my glasses.  Lotion leaves a film on the lenses that is very hard to wash off.  Having lotion-free soap throughout the house means that I don't have to go to the kitchen to use dish soap every time I need to wash my glasses.
B00IT1HKV4|5|Bought this to fix  my nails.  Been splitting and peeling.  Helped by using it everyday.
B00092M32C|5|I have very thick straight hair.  I use straight irons to curl my hair and the first time I bought this straight iron I was skeptical, however, what I found was that it really is a curlmaster.  I use this and flip it at the ends to make my hair wavy, and my hair looks soo shiny and I seriously look like I just came out of a hair magazine.  People on the street randomly ask me if I am a Pantene ProV hair model because of how good my hair looks.  I tried the Solia and PHI and Revlon -- not ONE of them is as good as this!  The Solia curls my hair but it falls out within 2 hours - with Gold N Hot my hair stays in curls for a week and doesn't get greasy.<br /><br />I would recommend this straight iron for anyone who wants gorgeous hair.
B005CD2A08|5|I love all of Edens Garden's essential oils!
B00NR8ZAO8|5|As the picture<br />Wonderful product<br />Very fast shipping
B00N545DSC|5|it will not fit a Lenovo X220 (as advertised), unless you remove the battery and carry that separately...
B00U68N9AO|5|WOW. Love this little thing. Hot pink w rubber inserts in the finger holes. Great for small hands and prevent fingers slipping and pulling your lashes out.' Both are removable to fit bigger fingers. Kit came w an item I had never seen before but now wonder how I EVER got along w/o it. Its a MASCARA GUARD to keep from getting mascara on your face (like I do ALL the time). GREAT idea. It has brow/lash comb on the other end but the kit also comes w the regular lash/brow comb we are used to. Oh. There's more...you ALSO get a pkg w 8 curler refills. Added to the one that already comes on it, that's 9 heavy, thick long lasting lash curlers in all. I image that would last quite a long time and those are always something I needed but would forget to buy. All said, this Lookout Lashes Eyelash Curler Kit has it all.<br />I was able to purchase this kit at a reduced cost for my own honest Review and Honestly, I LOVE it.
B00KDC8F8O|2|They really work.
B00EE9AD32|1|It's probably best for new borns. The bristles are extremely soft and doesn't do a great job for my toddler's curly soft locks
B00E5LEQVE|5|I use my morninghead cap almost every day! We even use it for our toddler in the morning and it works like a champ!
B000AADF20|3|I haven't seen much improvement in my cuticles . I may just have really bad cuticles but I will keep searching for a better product.
B000C1ZDTU|5|Awesome!
B00IX5PZZY|5|Taliah Waajid Curls and waves is an superb moistening product.  This product leaves my hair so soft and manageable.  I would recommend this product for anyone who's experiencing dry hair.
B00IZF358G|5|looks very natural as i love revlon and have for a long time
B00005LAA7|3|I thought it would be more moisturizing than it was, but overall okay for regular shampoo
B00H71AVFY|4|This is a really nice piece especially for the price.  The quaility of the hair is really lovely and looks it like human hair. Very happy with these extensions.
B003XUMQ56|3|I like the formulation of product on the pad but the pad is too small. Also, make sure to screw lid on tight!
B005UKOXMG|4|I'm guessing all of these are manufactured from China and from the same distributor because they're all pretty much the same. High pigmentation, long lasting power, but a lot of fallout. A good palette nonetheless.
B004NHVTJW|4|It heats up fast and it smooths out my hair without any frizz.
B00GHISXVW|4|Just arrived and I got a compliments on it already at the mall Love this Scarf, and its true to the picture on the site.
B00KLSOSRM|2|Eh, these really didn't work for my hair. Now I just have a bunch of them and am not entirely sure what to do with them. Garters, maybe?
B001E5D0HK|5|I tried this at a friend's house and ordered from Amazon the very next day...4 tubes!  The licorice-like flavor is subtle and delicious.  I don't miss mint at all.  It leaves your mouth fresh-feeling and fresh-tasting.  It also cleans your teeth like crazy.  And whitening?  Much better than any other toothpaste I have ever tried.  I want this on Auto-Delivery so that I never run out.
B00KCNXSKE|1|Couldn't even see in my blonde hair. Took forever to get here.
B001OXTHJC|4|I have tried several DE razor blades and currently I am using the Astras every shave. Other razors of inferior quality have been discarded or tossed in the back of my drawer. The only blade that I have tried that is superior to the Astra is the Merkur. That is why I hold the 5 star rating for the Merkur and give the Astra 4 stars.
B000P20U80|5|Amazing.<br />Love it.
B008GOR6O0|3|good
B00OY6OGO2|5|Good tart lemony scent. Exactly what I was looking for.
B005C2NARQ|2|quite a strong heavy scent, doesn't moisturize and calm dry skin down as much as I hoped. It's ok. otherwise, I do love shea moisture products. This one just wasn't for me.
B0097WZ318|4|nice as described
B009GEUPDS|3|(I received a complimentary system from Influenster and Olay to write this review)<br /><br />While I have plenty of cleansers that I'm currently working my way through, I have to admit I was surprised by how much I liked this one. It smells fantastic!!! I really mean that, as I love fruit-scented anything and this is not too overwhelming. As for the brush, I'm ambivalent about it. Sure, if you leave it on your face and move it in circles long enough your face will feel tighter when you're done (most people associate that feeling with the dirt/dead skin being mostly gone) but if you don't have the 15 minutes to wait for that feeling, then perhaps something else would be better for you. I really think it needs more of a \\"swivel\\" brush head, as it only really vibrates.<br /><br />Overall, I love the cleanser, would purchase again! Not so sure if I recommend the brush.
B00005LBRR|2|I bought this in the past and it smelled SO good. This time it did not. Smelled soapy and almost a chemical smell. I won't purchase this product again
B00G7PCF0U|4|Four EFFECTIVE Stars! Dove Men+Care Antispirant Deodorant mostly works as advertised. Boasting a &#34;Fresh Awake” muted masculine fragrance and an effective antiperspirant formula, it works in both cases in winter. However, it loses some antiperspirant power in the heat of a busy day now that outside temperatures are rising into the 80s, but it doesn’t ‘crash’, like some other brands. The deodorant aspect, however, continues working through the heat. Over a period of 3 weeks, it has delivered protection up to 30 hours without any signs of garment staining or irritation. Definitely Recommended. Four PROTECTIVE Stars! (2.7 oz, Active ingredient: aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY 15.2 %)
B004CQ710U|5|I was suprised that these things actually worked! I've tried many creams but bever really saw a big difference and a lot of them irritate my skin. Even after the first time, the lines around my mouth and forehead seemed to be much less pronounced. They left my skin feeling soft too. I wish they could be purchased in stores also.
B0037ZA4GU|2|Travel size yes but broke in my bag,  glass all over my set,  had to throw away
B003XNBUXW|5|This shampoo works well for what it is promised. I obviously like the tingly sensation, which I think you will as well. The next shampoo like it that is doctor recommended is SelsunBlue as opposed to Head and Shoulders, which doctors whom I have been in contact with says doesn't carry the same properties as SelsunBlue or the Design Essentials' Theraputics.
B009I2K7IG|5|beautiful and exactly what I thought it would be.
B004XNIR1E|1|threw away was no good for what i wanted to give my granddaughter, i thought i was getting a kit to use this or something with instructions
B00KEL75IU|5|It really is the color as shown (silver)<br />Came in estimated delivery time.
B00B1KM1XM|1|ok if zero stars was an option that would be my rating. I put it in my hair at 12 pm it is now 10pm and its still burning. and yes I washed every ounce of the relaxer out it just sucks! BEWARE IF U<br />WANT UR HAIR! burns the second u put it on. smh im just so pissed im done with the review please dnt buy this CRAP
B000L596FE|3|I have heard rave reviews about this and have tried other options for my 3 year old daughter without huge success, so I bought this.  honestly, this is no better.  it is a good brush, but I do not think it is much different than several of the other detangling brushes on the market.
B004FMA4XC|4|It's a very beatiful stuff, but the colors are too light. I wear the darkest one, and it goes with grey instead of black:(
B000MIKEFQ|1|I was extremely exiced to find the color that I have been looking for.  However, when the shipment from Amazon arrived, it was not in the package.  The item had been discontinued and they had no intensions of telling me until the shipment arrived.  With this happening, I have started shying away from Amazon.com because of the customer service issue that I had finding out about the discontinuation.
B001DNE3KQ|5|good
B008DC0X72|5|Love it! Fits perfectly
B004WVX0LO|5|It's my first time getting blotting tissues and these are amazing. They do the job and smells great! Love that green tea scent!
B001KW6AZ6|5|works fine
B000SBWIVA|2|I usually never write reviews but I had to make an exception in this case. I'm not sure why I didn't have a good experience with this shampoo like many of the other users. It was extremely drying to my fine curly hair and made it so frizzy it wouldn't curl. In addition, it felt like my hair wasn't clean and left with a residue. I switched to Dr. Bronners since it contains only natural castille soap with organic oils and I'm sooo happy. My hair feels so soft and clean and curls beautifully and I can use it on my body too! :-)
B0009XH6V4|5|Used this at one of top brand name Hotel, Like it very much, air volume is good with reasonable noise. Excellent product.
B0018HSKVA|1|WASTE OF MONEY HAVE TRIED SO MANY BRUSHES THIS CLUMPS UP THEN WHEN YOU CLEAN IT THE HAIRS CURL UP HARD TO TRAIN BRUSH
B009SCRSHE|5|This was my first jwoww tanning lotion... It got me dark so quick!! There isn't a bad tanning smell or anything and it makes your skin silky smooth while making you dark, quickk! Deff worth it :)
B00120VWJ0|5|quik deliver great quality
B002QIAEYQ|3|I like the color, I just don't like that its soo sheer that you have to keep reapplying it!
B0016O77FK|3|Easily dented
B002NEL6DG|5|These came sooner than I had planned and were in perfect condition (being new).  The style of brushes were more than I imagined.  I now have brushes that don't loose their bristles nor break the heads off.  I love these brushes, I would recommend these to everyone!
B005EII5BY|5|I buy this in bulk online so I'll always have it! Stays on great, and comes with a smudger AND a sharpener. Luv this navy color with my brown eyes!
B004Z40048|5|Great price!
B002NX0NU4|5|fast service, great product. I was really pleased with how fast the order arrived. Quality product, not too bulk to mount in bedroom at home
B000G686X6|5|After buying some baby clippers and found I didn't dare to use it with my baby's nails, I took my chance to buy this one after reading all the positive reviews. Man, I'm glad I spent the 20 or so bucks on this one which takes all the hassles away from fixing her little nails. It cut through the gentlest nails really easily, yet leaves me with no fear that I'm gonna cut my baby because of the design of the tip.
B000KQBTN6|5|This Gel is very Hard to find.  It's not stiff, but yet holds hubby's hair in place - great product and price  Thanks
B0096V6JPY|4|Its good
B004F0VYXS|4|Very nice cleanser. Use very little of to get a good wash.  Light and fresh feeling.  I am over fifity and happy with this product.
B004EDWMBO|5|Great variety of products, perfect for gifts
B002QFGKUQ|5|colors are nice and i use it everyday for my contouring, especially the brown and i use a combination of the pink blushes and the white for eyeshadow
B008J722HU|5|I love the silky-smoothness of AB products.  I'm a huge fan and now I have this soap/lotion set.  I just love their products and recommend them to anyone.  A++
B0049LUI9O|4|In my experience, these type of products tend to deteriorate quickly, but I must say, so far I'm very impressed. The product feels great in my hand, nice build, looks great. It cuts hairs fast and without pulling. The wet/dry aspect is very appealing. Much better than the cheaper versions by Panasonic. I will write an update in a few months.
B008DZG02Q|3|I like the color. Just wish it wasn't so thin. I had to use 3 coats to cover my nails. I like the glitter in it.
B00E4MMJ8Q|5|seems to make his life easier than using the cream stuff.<br />easy to use and stays put nicely<br />thanks<br />...
B00SMEOPLQ|5|One of the best beard brushes I've ever used. It works great, feels wonderful, and is very comfortable without the metal or plastic bristles. Five stars and very pleased with my product. Will spread references and info of this amazing product to all of my guys.
B00017XRAC|2|I was a fan of the seventies version of Love's Fresh Lemon--and the new stuff just ain't the same.  A friend remarked that it smelled like lemon furniture polish.  I wouldn't go that far--I'll grudgingly admit that it is pleasant--but the magic of the original formula is alas not there.  And the fragrance doesn't last--rub on a generous amount, and an hour later it's gone.
B000B9WF8U|4|I bought this after reading a review.  They don't make my old root lifter by Got2b fatastic, so I wanted to find a relatively inexpensive booster.  I think this does a pretty decent job of giving me volume.  I have fine hair and not a lot of it, so I need volume especially on days that I don't wash my hair.  I spritz water on my roots, then I spray this lemon-grass lift, then I blow dry the roots from underneath.  This lift also has a nice light natural scent, also good if you don't wash your hair that day.  It may not give maximum lift because it is on the lighter side, but it is good enough for me to recommend it.
B00LLPT4HI|2|I've bought other organic unrefined Shea butter and this does not appear as such. This is more white and less nutty in its smell. I'm questioning whether it's the real stuff. I wanted it for my newborn's skin but an scared to use it now. Disappointed.
B00428DLCK|5|I  was  on  Accutane  as a  teen.  Acne  was  mostly  gone  but I  had  the  occasional  pimple  during  my  period.  That  is  until I  hit  my  mid  thirties.  I've  been  having a  little  bit  of a  flare and  developed a  couple  of  scars  on  my  right  cheek.  I  bought  this  product  after  reading  reviews  and  have  been  very  impressed  so  far.  I  haven't  had a  pimple  since I  started  using  it  and  the  scars  are  starting  to  fade.  I  personally  don't  think  the  price  is  that  bad,  the  drug  store  products I  was  using  were  expensive  and  left  my  skin  irritated.  I  was  worried  it  would  be  too  drying  but, it  hasn't  been.
B0085RZLQ8|5|I've had the e series for 3 years and as of recent the battery needs recharging more often.  I wouldn't buy any other<br />kind of power brush.  Will upgrade to the Healthy White Sonicare when the time comes.
B005XUNG5I|4|This definitely helped my (not severely) callused feet. The device is light and easy to hold. I appreciate that it will stop if too much pressure is applied. I was surprised at the amount of time it took to get noticeable smoothing, especially as my calluses are not major. Maybe I need coarser rollers. I was very surprised that the instructions state that a roller should last only 1 or 2 sessions. That seems like a rip -off for something you may use several times a week. The price is less attractive when you factor in replacement rollers and that only one is included. Batteries aren't included either and I'm not sure yet how long those will last. A small cleaning brush is included which is only mildly useful and likely to get lost as there's no way to store it in or on the device. I'd give this 5 stars if the rollers lasted longer or replacements cost less.
B000GIL12C|5|I ahve used this cologne for 25 years. Have tried others in the past but nothing as appealing as this.
B000VXELII|5|I was a little apprehensive about this product and didn't expect much.  I used it the first time I cut myself shaving and it really worked well.  No more bloody wash towels while shaving.
B000WN9X6W|5|I just love the Tunu hairspray as I have fine hair and it gives me alot of body without drying my hair out. It does have a strong perfume scent that may not be suitable for everyone, but the product itself is terrific!
B00BC2K2Y4|5|Love this! It's super rich and creamy and ultra moisturizing. Best feeling ever! And great ingredients i love it.
B0086VI9LC|5|I love my toothbrush.  It is rather old so I can only find these replacement heads online.  I'd recommend it to anyone who has the tendency to brush too hard.  My dentist recommended it to a few years ago when she saw I was wearing the tooth enamel away with my brushing.  No more problems and I actually get a better teeth cleaning with it than my old standard toothbrush.
B007TIM8A6|5|This product is great! I had a blister that was readily soothed and healed after using this product. I love that it's organic.
B000KONYPY|5|Worth the money, I have been using it for 6 months and I do not need to wear makeup to cover my dark circles.
B0049LUI9O|5|I have bought numerous nose trimmers in the past, some expensive, but was never completely satisfied with any of them.  When I received the ER-GN30 I thought it was just another trimmer like the ones I had bought in the past.  To my surprise it worked great and in half the time as my old trimmers.  And after 4-5 months it is still going strong on the same battery.  It has a strong little motor that puts out more rpms.  Although the design looks about the same as the other models there must be a slight change in the design to make it work better.  Whatever the secret is I can highly recommend this nose trimmer.  Also, it works great on the hair in my ears.  Thanks Panasonic for developing this trimmer at a very reasonable cost.  LP in Iowa
B002Q8IHXQ|5|This is the best cream cleanser I've ever tried. Admittedly, I mistakenly got this thinking it was a foaming cleanser so I put off using it for a long time. I was surprised to find it has these teeny tiny fine exfoliating particles which feel so good as I massage the cleanser on my face. Really refreshing and feels reminiscent of my Estee Lauder So Polished Exfoliating Scrub. I paid way less than $15 ea for this, in a pack of 3 maybe and on sale at Costco. Not your typical cream cleanser!
B004QW9Z7M|5|Good for hair
B00G7PCF3W|5|I was interested in trying a truly different scent for deodorant. Everything that I have tried is some version of fresh, powder, or floral. This is really different.<br /><br />I felt like the odor and wetness protection was fine. I had no complaints. This was as effective as the clinical version of this same scent.<br /><br />I loved the scent. It smells like cookies but not with a strong vanilla note. It is a rich lucious kind of scent. It is different than any other deodorant. The scent stayed nice throughout the day. It blends easily with perfumes or lotions. I love this one.
B0038U4U3M|4|I made my purchase from Target @ 9.99.  Later found it at Wal-Mart (the same day) for 7.96.  The product did not work well for me as a DC, but it does a wonderful job as a leave-in.  I added some Argan oil, and my other secret ingredient and it does the job wonderfully.  As long as I can get the product on the ground, and have to make changes to the consistency....to make it work as a leave-in...I'm cool.  For 7.96 for 12 ounces...you get your monies worth.  I'm a AA, and menopausal...which means....dry, dry, dry hair.  I have to co-wash, and I absolutely need a leave-in.  I never did before.  I have combination hair on different sections of my head...believe it or not.  I have 3c, 4a, 4b, and 4c hair, and the thickness will flexuate depending on my hormones, or estrogen levels.  Since my hair tends to be on the thin side I have to thin down the mask.  But, I am pleased that I have found a product that works with a little tweaking, because I am just not going to spend all the money for the ingredients and the time, nor the shipping to have items sent to my home.  I hope this is helpful to someone else that maybe having the same issues as myself.
B001F0QWY2|1|My otherwise beautiful and wonderful girlfriend uses it and it is by far the worst product known to man. She actually smells worse, yes, worse than before applying it to her under pit areas of doom. You know that smell of overheated baboon feces you get when you take a wrong turn at the zoo? Yeah that's what this is like... Times 20. Also smells great in the morning. Realllllllllly great. I'm giving it one star because I'm wishing upon that one star that she starts using something other than this water bottle on a stick.
B001CORDM6|5|This is the best concealer I have found.  It covers my dark circles wonderfully. It does not cake up.  It works so well I often use it all over my face, with no foundation over it.
B007BJ3KQ4|4|Great Quality tools works great thus far, however I honestly thought the nipper to be bigger (to be able to nip acrylic) however I would recommend the nipper for use in the Manicure Service. It's too small for acrylic, however I'm loving the Curettes and I recommend them for my students and others. Sanctuary Nail Care (Mel Trinidad)
B003AKE256|2|This straightener is ok. It probably works great for people with already straight hair but it made mine frizzy static-like, and just did not straighten as expected. I stuck it in a drawer and probably won't use it again. It just didn't get hot enough to actually do anything.
B000C218N4|4|Great price on hard to find item.
B002GPHEEW|5|This seller is a fast shipper, product is fresh and high quality; product performs far better than all others I have tried.  Highly recommend this product, which I have used for years, and also recommend this seller.
B008EFFW1U|3|I thought I'd save money on razors by buying a safety razor and cheap blades;  The new razor and the LASER blades work O.K., although there are a lot of &#34;nicks&#34; also, but the corner store safety razors (disposable)shave better and are more comfortable.
B0062BE1NI|1|I have used other products by this company so I knew I'd like the smell, and I do! But the spray is over the top. We want a beachy, tousled look. That does not equal matted, mulched up hair. This is a nasty unwashed matted beach hair look...not sexy.
B0009EXONC|4|This is actually the only hairspray I will use. I have thick long hair and normally hate hairspray because it leaves my hair sticky and stiff. This, however, allows me to spray a little and still have movement along with hold. The price on amazon is cheaper than in most stores that I have seen, too!
B003ZC31K6|5|I've tried them all. Lancôme, Dior, Revlon, etc. This one is the absolute best.  You don't even need to curl your lashes. Just apply to the tips first and then sweep from base to end. No flaking, no raccoon eyes. Just perfect, long, separated lashes.  I'll never buy another brand of mascara again.
B00S9922ZA|5|Very easy to apply. Reduces dryness of skin and hydrates face very well. Will recommend it.
B006NXRD5S|2|It looks pretty but caught hubby using old beat up ones. When I asked, he said this one is too heavy to deal with. Oh well. I tried.
B0043RQOTW|5|This was even better then I expected, the all steel comb is not only lightweight but durable, definitely a good purchase.
B00KQASCDG|5|best product I have  ever bought!!!
B0030O5KHQ|5|I think this serves its purpose well and NYX is a good company. This doesn't break my skin out and I have sensitive acne prone skin,
B004I8GXWY|4|I received a sample of this(like .25 oz so pretty substantial for a product like this). I love it. A dot on each cheek and brow bone and I glow. Like look angelic. But just right. Like my lighting was done so I look youthful and bright. I love it so much I'm trying to find the best deal to order a full size. Ya if you want it to appear the color in the picture you need a few layers but if you want it to highlight your face in a subtle glowy way one layer is more than enough this stuff is shimmery.
B000143C0K|4|It gets hot quick but it also cools off just as quickly. It was for me and the kids at home.
B009W4D64C|4|My husband still has trouble with it. It can be hard to adjust. What it is is just a replacement.
B008AKVL3M|5|Bought this beauty for my wedding day! Very sparkly! Classy and just the right amount of bling! I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it highly.
B00AL14WES|5|This is the best travel flosser case I have found so far. It holds a lot of flossers, has held up to several months of daily use, and I have not had a problem (yet) with flossers not fitting. This is going to be my second one just because I want to have two for convenience.
B009R2EA12|2|This is definitely not the picture of what I purchased - very loose straps - the straps are different than picture, when tightened it does not keep the shape. Very cheap made. I will try to return this.
B00J4FA4SA|5|This product really works will continue to order would highly reccomend this product to others
B0015FSH8Q|5|First time using this hair spray so I will have to use it a few times to rate. I ordered the Aquage Transforming Paste and the Working Spray at the same time. Delivery time was fantastic! Received 2 days after ordering.
B00J1XN83S|5|This is a great product for anyone with dry skin and even moderate psoriasis. It helps to halt the psoriasis and soothes the skin with a sort of peppermint aroma - not offensive at all. While not a substitute for a doctor's prescription, it does not dry the skin like over-the counter cortisone cream.
B005E0NVMU|4|Good for sample packages and one time use...
B00GMOZUFS|4|Love this product. Hair is great every time.
B005O54IBS|1|The name says it all. The name of this product is incredibly offensive and this product should no longer be sold until it has a different name.
B000EBFJXS|5|NO MORE NOSE HAIR
B00AFEMBFS|4|this thing gets all the gunk off your face without damaging the skin. it does what it says. its just way over priced when the ingredient is mainly water! :(
B00BPAO48S|5|I've been using Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream for the past 10 years and this one is my favorite of all the scents.  Their products are great, and although they're a bit on the expensive side, I think it's worth it.  Make sure you use a shaving brush and not your fingers, as you'll get a much better lather and shave.  It will also last a lot longer.  Great product!
B009K7NA1U|4|I do like their facial moisturizers very much.  I've used three 'flavors' of Eminence SPF cream, and have loved them all.  Am still looking into less pricey brands, though.  This one can give a small tingling sensation, but not a turn-off.  Not sure if the brightening effect is true, but it could be!
B000C1Z3LS|5|Great price and received product as stated!  Furthermore, packaged product was perfectly protected for transportation (even if dropped it would not have broken)! Thanks!
B00D0ANSAG|5|THESE MAKEUP SPONGES ARE AMAZING.
B0016220GS|4|This was a gift for my Marine son. He likes the close shave and the storage case that comes with it is an added bonus. It has a mirror and even a little room for some water for rinsing yet its still compact.
B00P8GAN9Y|4|I bought this because I was having such painful intercourse. Once I got it in the mail I immediately tried it out. It numbed me within 20 min and lasted all night. At first there was a slight burning sensation but it was very bearable. This stuff really works
B00KT11OWI|1|I'm not seeing a improvement yet I have used this derma roller 5 times so I'll be increasing my derma rolling skin care regimen to 2 times a week Along with Hyaluronic Acid Raw Biology Organic Vitamin C professional grade kit. The kit has not given me any results either which I wrote review and I will update my review since I will need to finish up using that product until it's empty...I don't like throwing my money away. So, I'll continue to use this Derma Roller along with same skin care regimen (Raw Biology Hyaluronic Acid Organic Professional Grade Kit - organic Vitamin C,  Premium Retinol 2.5%&Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid &Vitamin C) that I've been using  until that product is gone. As for the switching roller heads from face to body roller use a thick cloth like a dry wash cloth so you can hold onto to it to place onto handle or you will hurt yourself like I did because this product only comes with one handle and the body roller is on it when you receive it and the face roller is separate and it's just the roller so you will have to place it on handle carefully by using a thick dry cloth. I was not pleased with that reason. You would think they would provide the face roller on a handle as well but they Do Not.  Also, there are No Instructions on how to switch rollers from body to face roller onto handle.  I had to figured it out on my own by using a dry washcloth. Do Not Attempt to do try and hold roller in your hand without a cloth when switching from body roller to face roller onto handle because you will hurt yourself and bleed.  Also, I did notice with face roller it sticks sometimes when rolling on face.  I've been using this 5 times with skin care regimen and no improvement as of yet so I'm increasing my Puruskin Derma Roller use to 2 times a week with skin care regimen products that I use morning and before bed..  I will be back to update this review in 4 weeks to see if I see any results fingers crossed I will with both products.
B00B7LTK52|5|As I am aging I am becoming very self conscious of my wrinkles. I have had trouble in the past finding a product because there are so many. My friend has beautiful skin and told me she used Glocione. In as little as a week's time I was already noticing a difference! Even putting on makeup was going on smoother. I highly recommend to anyone else struggling to find the right cream, as I was.
B000FPYY70|5|Finally found a cleanser that does not break me out, make me red, make me flake, make me itch, or make my pores clog. It smells kinda funny, but it's probably what you would expect soap of olive oil to smell like. It lasts a really long time. I have had mine for over three months now and I still have a lot to go! Great stuff. it will be all I will ever buy from now on.
B0043OYFKU|1|I've purchased two of these over the years. Both of them wore out & started smoking in the shower. Otherwise, I thought I liked it until I purchased a Clarisonic instead. The Clarisonic is much more gentle on the skin.
B00FQ1FYZE|5|was what I wanted
