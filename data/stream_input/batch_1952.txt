B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is fun to play. My daughters both play it and enjoyed it. I watched them play and decided to get it and play. It is good free game.
0345803485|5.0|This is my first amazon review and after reading a lot of the reviews on here looks like many were written by literature book worms. Well no wonder you didn't like it! Great book series, light reading. I usually don't get sucked into the pop culture craze of books, etc so I was on the fence about it. But I purchased it on iBooks and read all 3 in a week. I think it means something different to anyone who reads it. I think the point here is a woman wrote a book, she is a TV exec, and she was inspired to take something \\"ordinary to extraordinary\\" and in my opinion she did. She was inspired to write and she hit success. I do think some of the dialogue was not true \\"American\\" but I let it slide. Characters were odd and it sucked me in. ThenSex was sex. No surprises there.  Anyway great easy read.
B003JIPJRE|4.0|I found this movie to be on par with the story line of Arkham City, thought there was a lot of death in this one the dialoge was not as harsh or dark as what the story premise could handle.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Though most of the twists and turns in the story are foreseeable, it is refreshing to read a hopeful love story now and again!
B0044XV3R8|2.0|I enjoyed the movie and look forward to watching all of the special features included with this movie.  However, I am not impressed with the packaging.  There is a cover to remove to get to the box that holds the DVDs.  The DVDs are contained in a \\"book\\" where the pages are what holds the DVDs.  This sounds cool and the artwork is beautiful.  But everything is paper--the cover, the box, and the book.  Oh and the DVDs pull out of the \\"pages\\" and you unfold more paper to get to the DVD.  This is a lot of work for people who just want to watch the DVD.  The book that goes into the box is a very tight fit and then the pages that actually hold the DVDs get unfolded and folded each time a disc is needed.  This almost makes me want to look for another container in which to store the DVDs and use the box for display purposes only.  Granted everything that's made of paper is thick paper, but none the less, PAPER.  I was hoping for something that would last a while and would hold up to a lot of use and still look cool.  I'm giving two stars for the sustainability/longevity predictability of the packaging, but FIVE stars for the movie and all of the talent that it represents.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Good app! Simple to use!! Definitely recommend to someone who doesn't feel like searching for a calculator when you always know where your kindle is.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|All I can say is this  book made me cry laugh at the  Same  time. I felt connected to the characters. Well written highly recommend.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|My whole brain starts in the 80's, so for me this film is more likely to send me backwards to study the various influences that led up to a film like this. Adversely, your enjoyment of it is not strictly hinged on how many of it's winks and nods (to other films, genres, etc.) you can pick up on. It appears that several other reviewers have already laid out a laundry list of past films whereby we can view and see the roots of all the stylistic hallmarks in Django. It was much easier for me to diagnose influence with a film like \\"Drive\\" which utilized somewhat younger points of reference (Halloween, Apocalypse Now, Cape Fear, etc.)<br /><br />That being said, for the purpose of my review I will only compare this to Tarantino's past work. This is my first time to fall in love with one of his movies for reasons that don't include wild collages of plot twists. For my taste, Inglorious Basterds was too jarring in the way it constantly shifted from a boring crawl to ultra-violence, and I just didn't follow the plot as well as any of his other movies. Django, however, is very strait-forward and perhaps the first movie he made that does not rely on the same ADD hodge-podge of mini-plots. He still works with an ensemble cast, one of his other hallmarks, but they seem to be presented in a fairly linear fashion. This was the reason I didn't initially care for Jackie Brown. It seemed like a normal movie when I expected a movie made by a weirdo. So, it's sort of odd that this is supposedly part of a revisionist trilogy, which includes the very non-strait-forward plot style of Inglorious Basterds. Make of it what you will, but I see a lot of similarities between Django and Jackie Brown, in terms of the focused plot design and the way it takes an old genre and embellishes it in a way that is both familiar and entirely new.<br /><br />Although this film feels like Tarantino's least self-referential film yet, it's not all \\"worship and tribute\\" when compared to Kill Bill. To the contrary, it shines a vivid light on his eye for detail. Many may say that this is the same bloodfest as Kill Bill, but it's not. Bill 1 & 2 were infamous for the blood shooting across the room, but this is not an arbitrary style element. It is an element which is pertinent, because it's depicting slice wounds from swords, primarily. Seriously, watch the blood style in Django; the blood explodes visually with sounds resembling sacks of water bursting open. Both this and Kill Bill are fairly loyal genre films, and many people just see blood or whatever, but Tarantino does very detailed work. Even when he is exaggerating the exact intensity of the blood, he's doing it with a controlled style.<br /><br />I went into this movie expecting what my friend called \\"the most violent thing I've ever seen,\\" and \\"more violent than Drive.\\" I didn't really think it was the most violent, but moreso surprisingly consistent to Tarantino's other films. It is my understanding that the test audiences had a visceral reaction which led the director to trim down the mandingo scene, the dog attack scene, and maybe one or two other scenes. I'm glad, because as it stands, it narrowly avoided being indulgent. Had the camera held perfectly still at one angle, like Drive, then the violence would have been less bearable. I don't think I would like the director's cut, because if the violence against the slaves goes too far, then the viewer feels more numb towards the violence executed by the slaves out of revenge. On that note, I could have handled seeing at least another minute or two of Django whipping the slave master, no matter if it was merely a wink to \\"Roots\\" or not.<br /><br />My wife went into the movie expecting the violence to go too far, but she left feeling like it was a good movie. I think the humor was very important to strike the right balance. Tarantino's humor has always been a major asset to his films, and this is no exception. My wife even said she thinks my mom might watch it; I'mnot so sure about that (a bit squeamish), but I think my dad and my brother will like it. This is a great film, that goes to a lot of length (no pun intended) to tow the line between all of it's elements, from comedy, to history, to gore...every element has a deliberate and carefully calculated execution. I would watch this as an HBO series. Every single actor delivers an absolutely stellar performance.not so sure about that (a bit squeamish), but I think my dad and my brother will like it.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My whole family loves this game. Everyone from my 4 year old to my husband! Fun and easy to play while challenging.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|If you have ever played the game &quot;pandemic&quot; and enjoyed it,  then you will love this game.  It is better in every way.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I think this book is a good book because when the seniors come in and ruin the Valentine's  dance and the kids have to split the gym with them and then the person that ran the music had to quit it down but the hard part is when the seniors come in the Valentine's dance and then start eating every food the kids had so I think this book is a good book because when I was almost done with the book I think this author could have wrote an extra page for who gave him the chickenpox and how.
B0094K1K42|1.0|The movie just kept going and going without any real depth. Not good at all. The story line was ok but the acting and mood of the movie made things real boring. I wish there was a little bit more to it...like something that would make you want to see the end. I shut it off half way through. :X
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I had the opportunity to see the T.V. series and then read the two previous books, Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, both of which more than met my expectations. A Storm of Swords further surpassed all my expectations - I was amazed that a third sequel could be just as powerful, intriguing and exciting to read as its first two parts. I continue to be awed by the intricate weaving of the story that makes me loathe to put my Kindle down. When I expect to have all the loose ends come together, something unforseen happens and, for example, I continue to be at am at my wits end to see that the Starks cannot be finally reunited. Thus, I am really looking forward to downloading the fourth book!
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Movie didn't turn out to how people said it was overall movie was great quality and just seem like to be like a bad Santa movie
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I'm very happy I chose this book as my first read on my new kindle. It was a lot better than the movie.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book and found myself thinking about it when I went to bed and still thinking about it when I got up in the morning.<br /> The characters and the dialog really made me laugh-out-loud.  I rarely read a book twice, but this book could be one I will.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Wendy
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like it but I wish the boosts lasted longer but I really recommend buying this for you children they will love this fun addicting game and so will you!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I'm admittedly new to George Martin's writing, but no novice reader. I'm an avid sci-fi/fantasy reader since the 70's. So I have a standard perhaps different than most modern readers, as my review will reflect.<br /><br />Mr. Martin does an able job of creating a world and characters we can enter to suspend disbelief, but he is no J.R.R. Tolkein.<br />As I am sure he is well aware, Mr. Martin's real life world views and beliefs are as far apart as night & day, and his writing reveals it. Tolkein was a Oxford University Professor of languages whose Christian faith formed and informed his writing to the point of making it analogous in many respects. Mr. Martin's work reflects no such understand and appreciation. By contrast, George Martin paints a world for us which reaffirms no timeless divine principles of truth, right & wrong, or morality. It's a dark world where near pointless violence and barbarity exists to the point of being pornographic. It's religious references are all paganistic in kind and confusing at best. If anything, it accurately reflects the kind of world the Author may actually be when stripped of it's historical context and Christian influence.<br />My final criticism is an all too common one nowadays I'm afraid: Like most aspiring Authors who would find a place among the &#34;Greats&#34;, Mr. Martin has tried to compensate for a lack of depth with the most shallow appeal to the reader's prurient desires in pornographic depictions and situations. It is a shabby device, and one beneath a great writer's work.<br /><br />To the good, if he weens himself from such he will make a great writer, and not just a publisher of many words of little substance.<br />As a Christian historian and former Pastor, I make no apologies for my biases in this review. I do not wholly advise against reading Mr. Martin's works, just that readers do so with a fair warning as to it's heavily pornographic nature.
B000PXUA5W|4.0|The watch is basically as advertised, except that the soccer design on the face is easy to miss which made it less attractive to our child.

B005LAII08|3.0|So, I'm not sure what they were collectively smoking when they chose to make the Scottish Disney Princess film into a bear movie (pretty sure Disney already did this concept in Brother Bear), but that's what Brave is.<br /><br />It is beautiful to look at.  The story is cute.  The personality of the princess is adorable.  Her hair is the star of the film...and it is wonderful.  She doesn't run off with a prince she's known for 3 days at the end of the movie to live happily ever after.<br /><br />That's the good stuff.  Now, for the bad:<br /><br />The film is a rehash of Brother Bear with a girl instead of a boy and with a parent relationship rather than a sibling.  There is no discernible moral in the story, really, except a horribly written attempt at admonishing mothers to &#34;just listen&#34; to their recalcitrant adolescent daughters.  Stupid moral.<br /><br />It's worth watching.  Kids will love it.  It's gorgeous.  The brothers in the story are funny.  But...it's not going to be one of the Disney greats.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Picks up where Name of the Wind left off and keeps very fast pacing throughout. The setting changes are dramatic and well crafted, making the journeys very enjoyable to accompany Kvothe on. His encounters and companions delight the imagination and paint a lovely yet sometimes dark world where death is around ever corner, but we're always that one step ahead with our Namer. Cannot wait for the next installment!
B007MDB548|5.0|We love the Tinkerbell movies almost as much as our daughter does.  We like them because they all have good moral messages in them.  Tink's bad behavior is never rewarded, and she always learns her lesson.  This movie seemed lighter and less &#34;deep&#34; than the previous stories, but the moral was just as good and obvious.  It is : Rules exist for a reason, and breaking them will likely have consequences.<br /><br />Alongside this interwoven message is another delightfully fun and beautifully rendered fairy story about sisters separated at birth.  It's very cute.  Mother and Father-approved, and our daughter was mad for it as always.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I though this movie was better than the first one, it was great seeing all those great actors together at one time:-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the fact that I laughed and cried ,there was sorrow ,there was romance. I highly recommend this book to pretty much anyone older then 9!!!
034580404X|5.0|I had no problem with it, all books were there and in good conditions.  It was a gift so it was perfect
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I got this book along with the audiobook in order to try out the Whispersync and it was way cool.  I like to actually read books but don't get a lot of time to do that, so I could listen to the book when I wanted to and then it would sync up to the approximate location in the written version so I could read when I had a chance. Didn't get it to actually sync exactly to the same spots where I stop reading one and opened the other but it was close enough I could find it without problems.<br />I do bristle a little at having to pay twice for the same book, but I guess I do that with VHS and DVD movies if I want different formats so i can't complain.<br />The book itself is classic. Having seen the movie first I will tell you that the movie scared me a lot more than the book. But it was a good read and a good story.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a great set, awesome quality and lots of special features.  I highly recommend to anyone that wants these movies on Blu-ray.
0767824571|5.0|Even though the movie was made many years ago and I have seen it many times, it is still makes me laugh.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This book inspires to write and speak in a poetic way, and it's also the kind that will make you stop to take a sigh after reading some of its twists.
B0086700CM|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I got this game but thought I'd give it a try anyway.  Its fun and addicting and really I am terrible at it but I keep on trying.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a very good book. I could not stop reading this and it was my first of this kind.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This show gets better all the time.  I really appreciated this episode for dealing with the issue of white supremacists.  Henry Rollins and Adam Arkin are really good in this season.  Henry Rollins channels the big dumb white supremacist quite well!  Also, there is a rape scene with Gemma and that whole story line, culminating in her description of the rape to Clay and Jax is very moving.  As a woman, that,for me, is the most compelling story line of this season.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was not running out to get the sequels to this book.  It was just the same thing over and over.  How many times does he pull her hair, really??  Seem like a &#34;human&#34; version of the Twilight books.  Not impressed.

1451696205|5.0|Bought this as a gift for Christmas.  Shipped fast and was exactly as described.  Plus she loved it! Great book.
B00ATPVA78|2.0|this game was too short and easy to justify the price, at least IMHO. in order for g5 to keep up with their word to release &quot;a new game every week&quot; their games are really starting to go downhill. this one seemed more dialog than anything else thew few puzzles that are there were too easy  and the ho portion wasn't typical  for the genre. more like picking finding all the pipes from the tool box or finding the herbs among the flowers. then there was  a MAJOR glitch to make a &quot;love potion&quot;. there was an ingredient that 1) was NOT listed on the instruction sheet you are given and 2) was checked off as being done even though you did not follow that step. on top of that you can't go any further in the game till you figure all that out. the help button didn't help in that spot either. it just kept telling me to pull up the fire pit into a mini screen and even though I accomplished nothing with that mini screen open the hint then told me to close the mini screen and when back out the hint button would lead me rught back to the screen it just told me to close. big OOOPPPSSSS on the devs part. really starting to just staying awsy from any g5 games if their track record doesn't improve. they need to concentrate more on making high quality games and instead of putting out a weekly piece of @#$% just to make a quick buck.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|The quality was just fine. I bought this for my friend for Christmas and she loves it! No scratches or anything on the disk.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I did not know what was going to happen next. It is the sort of book you could read from start to finish without stopping.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Spent the time setting up all the alarms.  Come to find out it doesn't work. How this app has such a high rating, I have no clue. (Which is why I downloaded it in the first place.) Save your time and get an app that actually works. Deleting this one and getting something else.
B005LAII1C|1.0|If you have seen a single episode of Family Guy you pretty much have seen everything Seth has ever made. Ted was a huge disappointment and just another of Seth's generic take offs of Family guy. I told myself not to buy this but did anyway and regret it. Wait to see it for free or better yet skip it all together.
0765325950|3.0|I am very torn on rating this book so I went with a 3. I have enjoyed it so far (200 pages in this very moment) but I absolutely HATE reading from a hard cover book- it is big, bulky and inconvenient.  I would be willing to lay money on the fact that the vast majority of WoT fans are avid ebook purchasers, and this very much feels like the release strategy of the recent books have been done just to punish fans who are ebook readers.  The old school mentality of pushing profits might have made sense behind the scenes or in a previous decade or two, but punishing the very folks who are the biggest TOR type fans is a bad move.<br /><br />I can honestly say that my good will is completely gone.  I have read the series and now have the last book (Which will most likely end up donated or in the trash since I do not have the space to store large books), so the dedication to a contingent of folks who want to punish me as a consumer now ends. I, for one, will not be picking up any new series or spin offs that have this ebook delay built in.  I have plenty of other reading options in all genres on my Kindle that are never delayed in ebook edition.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that this message from myself and multitudes of others during the recent WoT releases reaches the ears of those who made the decision to punish folks like me.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It is awesome. I love the book but on the kindle fire it is better then ever I love it more

B0036EH3UC|5.0|I was a bit nervous after reading some of the reviews but... I am happy to say that the set I received appears to be devoid of any of the problems with packaging, missing titles, counterfit disks and the like.  Each disk is packaged in its own plastic box and the larger box holding all the sets is fairly sturdy.  Glad I decided to go ahead and purchase this set, absolutely not disapointed with it at all, so far :).
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like this game because it is a challenging game.  I enjoyed playing it.  I would recommend this game to friends.

B0014E917Y|2.0|The price for the Godfather Trilogy set was reasonable.  The shipping information was adequate and arrived when stated.  Unfortunately, when my husband & I tried playing the DVD's in our DVD player, we received the message \\"region error\\" on our screen.  We tried playing the DVD's in other players in our home and received the same message.  Not being able to play the movies has been a true disappointment.
030759565X|5.0|Deb continues her great blog style with this very enjoyable and very usable cookbook. The photography is beautiful, and the stories she writes about each recipe are entertaining and informative.

B005LAII80|5.0|I got to say that after the Judge Dredd Film with Stallone, I was nervous going into this thinking it would be another crappy adaptation of the comic.  I have to say that I was blown away with how well this film came together.  This movie left me wanting more.  I read that there were plans for a trilogy if the film did well.  Due to poor box office results, this may not happen.  I can only hope that sales pick this film up and gives it the boost it needs for a sequel.  If you are a Dredd fan, action film fan, and/or gore fan, this is the film for you.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Great movie... Action and suspense through the entire movie.  Surprising ending!  Both actors stole the show....and it doesn't Hirt that I am an Emily blunt fan.

034580404X|5.0|This is the best books ever. I actually don't read much but this book got me into reading but nothing compares to this one yet
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Before I read this book, I looked at some of the 1-star reviews. Then after having read less than half the book I began to wonder if we (the low reviewers, and I)were considering the same book. When I read a book, unless I'm researching something, I read it for enjoyment. On that count this book delivers, and very, very well. I don't care if there are minor factual discrepancies between this, and prior \\"Ryanverse\\" novels. I might feel differently if a previously killed character suddenly came back to life, but apart from some glaring problem, why obsess about something minor? Threat Vector is nearly non-stop action, and the violence being dished out isn't unilateral. I can tell you that if you have previously enjoyed Clarke, and Ding, they figure heavily in the overall story. I'll not go any further into it than that. I'll just say that any of the books featuring Clarke and Ding, have always delivered satisfaction, and so will this one. Yes, the fact that this book is co-written, does make it somewhat different than the average Clancy book, but in this particular story, that difference isn't a negative one. Read the book. Make up your own mind independently of the naysayers. My bet is that 99% of the readers of this book will be well satisfied when they are done.  ***** While ruminating on this book and the review that I'd written, it occurred to me that there was one thing that I failed to mention about it.  This book gives a very plausible \\"What If\\" scenario about how things could eventually play out between the USA and China.  China does, in fact, have people dedicated to cyber-warfare, and it only stands to reason that their prime target is the United States.  With that in mind, it's very easy to see that the book is more than just entertaining; it's relevant!  It should serve as a warning to any still unaware of just what it is that China is preparing, if not intending, to do.
1451695195|3.0|While I appreciate Dr. Alexander's experience and the detail he gives us with his story, at times it was too complicated and technical.  He is definitely a scholarly physician who knows his stuff.  However, I wish he had more help in putting his story into a book.

B005LAIHCW|2.0|This movie was ridiculously predictable, not even a slight surprise happened. If you like alright movies, I would suggest it. But, there is absolutely 0 re-watchable qualities to this film. I can still remember every single detail and I saw it once, in theaters on the release weekend. It was just too simple-minded. I would have given 1 star, but I liked Elisabeth Shue's performance.

B004HW7JHE|5.0|You either love Mad Men, or you hate it.  If you love it, then yes, you've got to have the full Season 5.  I'm sorry, I'm not a &#34;watch as it airs&#34; devotee, waiting for each season to start, and then not missing any shows.  Seeing a series on DVD/Blu-ray, where you can sit and watch one episode after another, and see the whole series within a few days, to me is more enjoyable.  You really get the cohesiveness of the writing that way, and get more engrossed in both the story line and the characters.  You also get the added DVD/Blu-ray extras that give you insight to the making of the show.  Now I'm already looking forward to Season 6!

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|After 14 years together, my husband and I went through a rough spot in our marriage. I think we both weren't feeling appreciated anymore. A friend recommended this book and after reading it and talking to my husband about some of what I read, we are both trying harder to show each other in the way that we each need that we're appreciated and loved.

B001RUXW48|1.0|'Body of Lies' follows CIA agent Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) in the Middle East trying to foil a terrorist plot, while his controller, Ed Hoffman (Crowe) sits back safely most of the time in Virginia. There's the usual tension between young subordinate man on the scene and an old boorish boss far away, a very poorly scripted romance between Ferris and nurse Aisha, and far too many Arabic names and faces. (Yes, most of them look alike to me.) Then just in case you're not already bored stiff, there's political posturing and preaching thrown in. At the end Ferris throws away his CIA career and remains in Jordan to be with his honey - just one more in the film's collection of worn-out themes.<br /><br />Actually, at times I thought the movie was just a long Lincoln ad - every chance the director had utilized a parade of brand-new, spotless black Lincoln SUVs, about as realistic in poor Middle-East nations as me winning a gold medal in the 2016 Olympics.

B003H6KRIE|5.0|I had read a few reviews before buying this that the packagin/boxing for these BluRays was hard to open, but apparently that is for the very old orders because mine comes in a very simple and nice boxed set that is very easy to slide the BluRay's out of, my rule is always order directly from Amazon and you won't have to worry as much about these things.<br /><br />The quality is just fantastic! I am a fan of the trilogy so to see it in such clear quality was just amazing. It was very crisp and the action was better than ever!

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I couldn't put it down from the moment I read the sample. The author makes you feel as though you are in the story too, observing Pat Peoples as he goes through these struggles. It was funny too...moments that made me laugh out loud to myself. I would definitely recommend this book to my friends.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I have to admit, at first I was no a fan of Halcyon, it is so different than her other album. After listening to the songs more and more, giving it a good fair chance, I think I really like this album, haha. Ellie Goulding has a way of drawing you into the music, it's a really good album.
B007FJFDXS|1.0|All this game is is rolling a cube through a maze to a finish point. If I hadn't picked it up as the free app of the day i wouldn't have it at all. Think marble madness with a box.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am really enjoying this bag, tons of space to store my camera(s) and other supplies. It's not too big though, feels normal when carrying it. The inside is very adjustable because of the velcro compartments. This is neat because you get complete freedom of where to put things and the space to use, but it's sort of annoying to deal with velcro at times, that's just a given. Overall it's a great bag for the price and I am not sure there are any better ones for the price on the market.

B0084U0IEG|5.0|Most important, this cold war style British story is a fun and fast read.  But it also has a couple great hooks.  The non-traditional protagonist seems like someone I might actually know -- or at least used to know.  Then the provocative context raises  questions that seem realistic  -- questions like &#34;hmmm, did that really go on, and does it still go on?&#34;  The author's research outline in the epilogue (don't read this first) makes me answer the question &#34;yes&#34;.  A worthwhile read.

B001IYCMNA|5.0|Easy to upgrade to the newest firmware and easy to configure with the web gui.<br />Only thing I would mention is, this is an Access Point and does not have a DHCP server on board.  You will need another appliance or device downstream to provide DHCP.  Something like a SonicWall or NetVanta or even a PC with linux doing firewall/nat/dhcp duty.<br />I used 8 of these devices (4 utilizing POE) connected to a Cisco switch to provide wireless access for a midsized hotel.  Hotel is 3 stories with concrete floors and cinder block walls and coverage is excellent and seamless with both 5 and 2.4 ghz bands.<br />i.e. From the first floor, I get 50% signal strength from the AP on the third floor at the other end of the building.<br />And my customer is very happy with the coverage and data rates.<br />I would recommend this AP based on my experiences with them.

B009CF3P7E|4.0|A great continuation of the longstanding franchise.  Rhe movie is not terribly bogged down by the minutia that red-shirted ear wearing fans would prefer, but still with enough due diligence and references to keep them happy.  An altogether pleasant reboot with a cliche alternate universe for enough suspense to make the sequel ver y much anticipated.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|This really was a safe haven for a thriller junkie wanting a meaningful sorbet of contemporary romance between doses of adrenaline based action. I was looking for an intelligent romantic thriller outside the current popular genre of poorly written mass-produced twenty-something testosterone and sex romances - and I found it in \\"Safe Haven\\".<br /><br />Surprisingly, although I have seen and enjoyed the movie \\"Message in a Bottle\\", I haven't read any of Nicholas Sparks' books. I was lured to this book by how fast it got to the top of the Kindle best-sellers list. From the first pages it was clear that Sparks is a quality writer who builds wonderful characters and weaves meaningful relationships.<br /><br />When Katie Feldman arrives in the small North Carolina town of Southport she is seen as a mysterious person. She rents a small cottage in a lonely spot, doesn't mix with others or tell anyone about her background. Her life revolves around working at a local restaurant, improving her cottage and buying her essential needs from the local store owned by Alex, a single parent of 2 young children who has recently lost his wife to brain cancer. She gradually gets attracted to Alex and builds a loving and comfortable relationship with his children.  Despite this she doesn't have the emotional stability for a long term commitment.<br /><br />The community and Alex are not aware that Katie is is on-the-run from a very bad mentally and physically abusive marriage. Even with a new identity she knows that Kevin, her alcoholic abusive husband, is a skilled police investigator who will search for and find her wherever she goes.<br /><br />Why did I give it 4 stars - because I skip-read the description of Kevin's life after Katie left because it was too long and IMHO a bit unrealistic. Despite that I liked the book and strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an easy, well written and satisfying romantic thriller.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I am almost ALWAYS a sucker for a 'based on a true story' kind of movie.  And, this one did not disappoint.  I just wish the director/producer hadn't thought the need for excessive blood and aggression was necessary to get the story across.  I have no doubt it was historically accurate in that regard, it was a rough and tough time in America, I just didn't need to see it on the screen.  I, personally, am not yet desensitized (and probably never will be) to that sort of theater and would have enjoyed the movie a little more if I hadn't been on guard to shield my eyes with a couch pillow whenever I thought an excessively bloody and hostile scene was about to play out.  But, LOVED the 'story' and the actors/actresses that starred in the film.  Not one I can say 'I need to see again', though.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Nice mindless game to play. Good for the kids when they won't sit still for anything. Overall I would purchase it again
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I liked the original 3 much better. The newest one bordered on sci-fi more than just an action flick. Renner was good in the role though.

0385536828|3.0|You can hardly go wrong with Ian McEwan. His books are always worth a read, but, of course, some are better than others. Sweet Tooth is not as good as Atonement or even On Chesil Beach, but it is interesting and offers some insight to Britain during the Cold War. The main character, Serena, is the biggest problem for me - I just didn't find her and her romantic entanglements that compelling. McEwan tries to give her more depth by framing the story through Serena's eyes as a much older woman looking back on her youthful escapades. But she still seems like a silly girl of average intelligence and conservative views except where it comes to sex.  McEwan's writing is so good that I can forgive him almost anything, but Sweet Tooth is not his best work.
0316069434|5.0|I like most writings by Michael Connelly.  The Black Box is a good read.  Much better than his last two novels.  More like the Michael Connelly we are accustom to.  Not quite as much twist at the end as his older novels but sufficient entertainment.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Simply put, The Hunger Games is a huge success - and not just at the box office. From the dark, dreary, dystopia of District 12 to the brilliantly shining, colorful, excited nature of the Capitol, The Hunger Games is a winner. Directed by Gary Ross, the film blends the two worlds seamlessly.<br /><br />The film, which is based on the first book of The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, is set in a country called Panem. Using a clever propaganda film, the film indicates why every year, the citizens of the twelve districts offer up as tribute one boy and one girl to fight to the death in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />It's a dark world, which is run by the Capitol. Through controlled fear, organized restrictions of resources, and the Games, the Capitol maintains its rule without disruption. Governed by President Snow (Donald Sutherland), Panem is very separated. Each district is isolated, alone, and unaware of the conditions in the other districts.<br /><br />The hero, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), lives in District 12. District 12 is straight out of Great Depression-era Middle America. Dark, dirty, and poor, District 12 is home to the mining ore operation for Panem. Katniss finds her solace in this world in the woods outside of the fences, where she hunts with Gale (Liam Hemsworth). We're never sure about the true nature of the Katniss and Gale's relationship, although their feelings for each other are visually suggested that they're probably stronger than simple friendship.<br /><br />At the Reaping (the tribute selection event), which is overseen and emceed by Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Katiniss volunteers to save her sister Prim, who is originally picked. Acting as a volunteer is a first for the District - something the citizens of Panem don't overlook. Katniss' male counterpart and tribute is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). It quickly becomes clear that everything that surrounds the Games is played up for the audience.<br /><br />As Katniss and Peeta are shipped off to the Capitol, a former Games winner and mentor for the District 12 tributes, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), makes his first appearance. Haymitch initially comes off as a drunk, sarcastic, and relatively worthless mentor. As Katniss and Peeta prepare for the Games, Haymitch slowly warms to them and begins to offer nuggets of wisdom. Harrelson is a fun casting choice. He's the visual representation of blending District 12 grit with the Capitol style, and he offers an entertaining performance steeped with humor. As Team 12 works to appease the audience, Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), team stylist, rebelliously makes them visual protests to the Capitol. During the pre-interview sequence with the wonderful Games commentator Caesar (Stanley Tucci), Peeta drops the bombshell that he's been in love with Katniss since he was a child. Katniss and Peeta are now the star-crossed couple.<br /><br />All of the plot building expertly amps the tension that leads to the moment when the heroes enter the Arena. It's here that the film hits its stride. Ross crafts a film in which children are violently slaughtered - which instills regret and discomfort in the audience. Witnessing the death of children is jarring and creates a very self-aware feeling in the audience. Just by sitting in the theater, we're just as much of the Panem audience and the experience of the Games.<br /><br />Some critics have complained of the shaky cinematography (result of not using a Stedicam), but Ross strives to show the viewer the chaotic and jarring nature of the Games. Visually, The Hunger Games is stunning. There are certainly effects-heavy shots, but they never seem out of place or fake. The set pieces for and design of the Capitol are amazing. In contrasting the dirt and grime of District 12, the filmmakers make apparent the pure decadence.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss with great resolve and restraint. Many of the moments during the Games are reflected in her eyes.The Games' stress, sadness, anger, and fear are all honestly apparent to the audience (real and cinematic). Hutcherson isn't as strong as Peeta but does win the audience over towards the end of the film. This isn't his fault because his role is greatly reduced from what it is in the novel. However, this is Katniss' story. She's the hero, but she's a reluctant and unwilling hero, who rises to the occasion when necessary. Smart, cunning, and aware of her situation, Katniss never takes risks that aren't needed.<br /><br />The film is the same way. The book is darker and more violent but also slower. Ross smartly balances these slower scenes during the Games with moments that let Katniss think and react to the artificial world around her.<br /><br />Overall, The Hunger Games is a fantastic film. While the first book doesn't as openly end with threads for an obvious sequel, the film very much does. With a date already set for the second film - Catching Fire in 2013 - these Games are just getting started.<br /><br />[...]parent to the audience (real and cinematic).

B00003CXCT|2.0|This was to have been a Xmas gift for my adopted Mexican family Two children ages 5 and 10. I ordered them in spanish and two out of the 4 we In English. Poor quality control. I Will be returning them for a full refund and two very disappointed kids
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|When Men in Black came out in 1997, I was thirteen. Will Smith was a huge box office star (and he arguably still is), and his rap career was about to explode thanks to his album, Big Willie Style (1997). When I first saw Men in Black, I was a huge fan. I was impressed with the creative story and willingness to accept the absurdity of dealing with aliens. It was refreshing, funny, and entertaining. Then, in 2002, the less enjoyable sequel came out. It was still a box office success but not as widely regarded or enjoyed as the original.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2012. Men in Black 3 seems like a logical film to finish a trilogy, but it also doesn't seem necessary. The teenager in me was more than excited to see MIB3, but my expectations weren't that high. However, as soon as the movie ended, I walked out of the theater incredibly impressed.<br /><br />Men in Black 3 takes place fourteen years after the original. Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and  Agent J (Will Smith) are still partners. K is still old, cranky, and by the book. J is still the fun, sarcastic, ambitious, and unpredictable agent. The relationship between K and J worked fifteen years ago, and it still does. In fact, their relationship is the crux of the whole film.<br /><br />The film begins with an elaborate prison break from Lunar Max, the super-high security prison for alien criminals on the moon. Boris The Animal (Jemaine Clement) is regarded as the most dangerous prisoner there and, of course, is the first to escape. Boris has a magical little creature that lives in his hand and shoots an unlimited number of bone spikes, thus providing him with plenty of ammunition. He is hell-bent on escaping the Moon in order to have revenge on K for shooting his arm off forty years ago and putting him in prison.<br /><br />It's a simple enough plot and a wonderfully absurd reason for Boris' evil motivations. Boris escapes back to Earth and seeks out the ability to travel back in time to kill K before he shoots his arm off. This is where the film really hits its stride. In a touching scene, K attempts to talk to an angry J about some universal secrets he hasn't shared yet. J is furious that these secrets still exist after being partners with K for fourteen years. After J discontinues their conversation, K awaits a fight with Boris. But the fight never comes, and K literarily vanishes on the screen.<br /><br />With Boris successfully killing K in the past, J must go back to 1969 (when K dies) to save him and the world. Back in 1969, young K (Josh Brolin) is a fun loving, young, hotshot agent. Brolin masterfully captures the character of K but still adds his personal touches. He isn't as cranky, and there are moments of true emotion. J's ongoing joke is always, \\"What happened to you?\\" Because of the sophistication of the relationship between the young K and J, the film offers more than just popcorn- and explosion-fodder entertainment. It actually creates something more important: a character-based film with people you actually care about.<br /><br />Without going into details, the climax of the movie is exciting, thrilling, and heartbreaking. The consequences redefine the entire trilogy for the characters. In fact the climax of Men in Black 3 makes the first film even better and will only improve it with repeated viewings of the trilogy.<br /><br />From a geek perspective, Men in Black 3 is also one of the single best examples of the depiction of time travel in recent films. The cause and effect consequences of meddling with time are all apparent, thought out, and used perfectly in various parts of the film. It's an almost realistic take on time travel. There are no apparent time paradoxes created, and it's not a plot that is challenging to ponder within its various timelines.<br /><br />Director Barry Sonnenfeld has been hit or miss in his career (mostly hit), but he nails it here. His vision for color and character contrast is his masterstroke, and this is one of his best achievements yet as a director.<br /><br />Men In Black 3 is by far the best of the trilogy and a wonderful way to end the series (hopefully, but unlikely). Yes, it's a great popcorn, summer blockbuster, but thanks to a creative, funny, and entertaining screenplay, it has the makings of a film to be much appreciated long after its theatrical release.ments yet as a director.<br /><br />Men In Black 3 is by far the best of the trilogy and a wonderful way to end the series (hopefully, but unlikely).

B008602KQI|4.0|Overall this was a good movie.  The plot was a bit weak at times but the action flowed through out the movie.  Well worth the watching.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|Given the commercial and critical success of The Bourne Trilogy, doing a relaunch of the series was a no-brainer. Whether the character of Jason Bourne could/would continue without Matt Damon was the big question. When The Bourne Legacy was announced, there were questions of whether the story would follow the plot of the novel. Starring Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, it bares no resemblance to the novel other than the title.<br /><br />Renner does a nice job as Cross. He's a believable trained assassin and action star thanks to his successful roles in The Hurt Locker, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, and most recently, The Avengers. He's methodical, smart, lethal, and very athletic--almost unnaturally so. The film's plot runs parallel to The Bourne Ultimatum. The aftermath of Bourne's actions in New York are causing collateral damage and Col. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) is leading the clean-up efforts. He's as secretive as possible and his government/spy lingo is just as elusive to the audience. Filled with acronyms, code words, and projects, without having seen the first three Bourne movies (particularly [[ASIN:B00130UFY2 The Bourne Ultimatum]]), you're likely to be completely lost.<br /><br />The clean-up efforts include eliminating the remaining operatives in the field, one of which is Cross. The story jumps between the spy overlords in Washington and Cross trying to find more of the medicine prescribed in his program. It's here that we're introduced to Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz). Dr. Shearing and her team run the medical side of the program (although they're not entirely clear as to what they've been doing). They work to create behavioral modification in the form of a pill, as well as to develop physical improvements on the genetic and neurological level for the operatives.<br /><br />Through a series of violent events, Dr. Shearing and Cross's paths meet. Promising to help Cross in his search for the medicine, their story advances while Byer works to eliminate both of them. There are some very exciting action scenes, including one of the longest chase scenes in recent memory, lasting over fifteen minutes. Director Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton, Duplicity) also wrote the screenplay, as well as the previous three Bourne screenplays, so the language of the film is the same. Where the film suffers is the pacing and story structure. The continuous cutting between the Bourne clean-up in Washington and Cross's early exploits slows down the pacing. The film feels disjointed at times and the events in Washington D.C. don't feel as urgent and detrimental to the secrecy of the program as the characters would suggest.<br /><br />The biggest flaw of the film is the lack of resolution to any of the story-lines. Gilroy must be under strict instructions from Universal to continue the Bourne series in a new trilogy. Everything is left open, ambiguous, or unanswered for the inevitable sequels. In the recent age of turning stories into film trilogies or more to increase profits (i.e. The Hobbit, The Hunger Games, Harry Potter, Twilight), Universal and Gilroy have apparently created only one-third of a story. Without the sequels, The Bourne Legacy doesn't feel like a complete film. Despite coherently-directed action sequences and a good script that is well-acted, it's difficult for the film to stand on its own. Where as the first three Bourne films can all be viewed independently of each other, The Bourne Legacy is merely the first piece of a project that's years away from completion.minate both of them.

The film feels disjointed at times and the events in Washington D.C. don't feel as urgent and detrimental to the secrecy of the program as the characters would suggest.<br /><br />The biggest flaw of the film is the lack of resolution to any of the story-lines. Gilroy must be under strict instructions from Universal to continue the Bourne series in a new trilogy. Everything is left open, ambiguous, or unanswered for the inevitable sequels. In the recent age of turning stories into film trilogies or more to increase profits (i.e. The Hobbit, The Hunger Games, Harry Potter, Twilight), Universal and Gilroy have apparently created only one-third of a story. Without the sequels, The Bourne Legacy doesn't feel like a complete film. Despite coherently-directed action sequences and a good script that is well-acted, it's difficult for the film to stand on its own. Where as the first three Bourne films can all be viewed independently of each other, The Bourne Legacy is merely the first piece of a project that's years away from completion.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Sitting in the theater during The Avengers (2012) was unlike many previous theater experiences I've had. I sat with a grin squeezing my wife's hand in joy. Pardon the clich&eacute;, but I felt like a kid in a candy store. If you read Cultural Transmogrifier`s Staff Discussion, you know the expectations I and the staff had. They were quite high to say the least. I was more than pleased with the results and my expectations were more than met.<br /><br />Joss Whedon felt like an inspired choice for director when it was announced a few years ago, and I stand by that. Whedon and Zak Penn's story, and Whedon's screenplay, translates to an Avengers comic come to life. Simply put, The Avengers  is one of the best comic book adaptations ever made.<br /><br />Building off the success of the previous character films, Whedon was able to jump right into things with this story. I will only briefly and vaguely touch base on the specifics because I don't want to spoil anything. If you haven't seen the previous character films you won't be totally lost, but there are a few things that will just gloss right over you. The basic story revolves around the tesseract--an extraterrestrial source of unlimited power. It's under the control of S.H.I.E.L.D. and they're running tests on it under the guidance of Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård). Learning that the tesseract is a portal device, we witness the reentrance of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to Earth.<br /><br />Loki is working with an extraterrestrial race hellbent on bringing Earth to its knees. It's hinted that Loki is not merely the powerful messenger, but the leader of this new army. The only ones who stand in his way are the Avengers, who are brought together through various circumstances and thrust together in the final act by one significant character . . . moment. (Anyone familiar with Whedon will understand this.)<br /><br />Every question I had about what our characters were doing between their own films and this one were answered in one way or another. The cast continues to be excellent. Most will give the nod to Robert Downey Jr., but I think a special spotlight should shine on Chris Evans. His portrayal of Captain America is ideal. He is still the super solider of the early 1940s, and despite being out of time and out of place, the leader within is clearly there.<br /><br />The struggle to establish the team mentality of The Avengers is a joy to watch. Each character is perfectly written, self-aware, and aware of each other's flaws--which they are quick to point out. FINALLY, I think the Hulk/ Bruce Banner have been written correctly and expertly. Watching Hulk smash is just so awesome! The Avengers is filled with just the right amount of exposition, action, story, and best yet, humor. Just when you need a breather, Whedon offers it up and tosses in a wonderfully written joke delivered by almost every single character in the film.<br /><br />Without detailing anything else, just know that when this movie ends, it doesn't really end. Most people know that Marvel likes to add a \\"stinger\\" at the end of the credits, an extra scene to tease about a future film. This is no different. In fact, The Avengers offers two such scenes. (The first one--I called it! See our Staff Discussion for proof). Make sure you stay in your seats until the theater lights go fully up and the screen turns off. Any sooner and you'll miss out. 30% of the audience left before the first tease, 95% were gone before the final one. Don't be that person! Trust me, after a somewhat exhausting 2 hours and 22 minutes, that final scene is just what the Captain ordered.another. The cast continues to be excellent.

B000T00PE2|5.0|Cultural Impact is a column looking at musical albums that have found their way into multiple pop-culture mediums (films, tv shows, video games). Hopefully this column teaches you more about the artists and albums behind some new music that you've probably heard but don't know much about.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />On April 20, 1998, Massive Attack released their third studio album Mezzanine. (Trivia: MA's website provided Mezzanine for legal download before its official release and it was one of the first major albums to be released in MP3 format.) After the major success of their debut album, Blue Lines and their follow-up Protection, MA's Mezzanine was also a critical success. It was certified platinum in the UK, but didn't achieve the same popularity and sales levels in the US, which is an absolute shame. Although the album sales were lower in the US, tracks off Mezzanine have been used over and over again in different pop-culture mediums.<br /><br />\\"Angel\\" - 6:18 (Del Naja/Marshall/Vowles/Hinds)<br /><br />The lead track \\"Angel\\" is the most widely used song off the album. It has been used in the films Firewall, Go, Flight of the Phoenix, Stay, Antitrust, Pi, and Snatch. Snatch. is easily the best example of a film using the song. The eerie, pulsing crescendo of the song perfectly parallels an intense moment of the film as Mickey (Brad Pitt) watches the caravan burn with his mother inside.<br /><br />\\"Angel\\" is a song all the more haunting when it compliments a visual--something that was also done in The West Wing episode \\"Commencement\\" and in the pilot episode of the CBS drama Person of Interest.<br /><br />Other uses:<br />Grimm - episode \\"Dream\\"<br />Luck - episode three (Luck also used Massive Attack's \\"Splitting The Atom\\" as it's main theme).<br />Smallville - episode \\"Rogue\\"<br /><br />\\"Risingson\\" - 4:58 (Del Naja/Marshall/Vowles/Reed/Seeger)<br /><br />While not used for dramatic effect, \\"Risingson\\" was used as background for a scene in Abre los ojos (1997), directed by Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar (The Others) and starring Penelope Cruz.<br /><br />\\"Teardrop\\" - 5:29 (Del Naja/Marshall/Vowles/Fraser)<br /><br />Used nearly as much as \\"Angel,\\" \\"Teardrop\\" is probably the best known song off Mezzanine thanks to being the theme for House M.D.. It was also used in The Simpsons episode \\"Postcards from the Wedge,\\" the pilot for the UK show Occupation, the Prison Break episode \\"Tonight,\\" and, in what was possibly its earliest use, the Daria episode \\"Write Where It Hurts.\\" \\"Teardrop\\" is one of the most beautiful songs on the album and more similar to the earlier stylings of Massive Attack's first two albums.<br /><br />\\"Inertia Creeps\\" - 5:56 (Del Naja/Marshall/Vowles)<br /><br />An aptly titled track, \\"Inertia Creeps\\" is a song that feels like it is constantly building tension throughout. Because of this, the song has been used in the thriller movies Taking Lives (2004) and Stigmata (1999) as well as in the South Korean film Some (2004).<br /><br />\\"Dissolved Girl\\" - 6:07 (Del Naja/Marshall/Vowles/Sara Jay/Matt Schwartz)<br /><br />One of my favorite songs from Massive Attack, \\"Dissolved Girl,\\" is another song in which the intensity continues to build. It's slow, intense, exciting, and constantly evolving all within six minutes. The various parts of the song have been used to match these feelings in The Jackal (1997), The Matrix (1999), and the first trailer for Uncharted: Drake's Fortune (2007).<br /><br />\\"Superpredators\\" (Japanese bonus track) - 5:16 (Del Naja/Marshall/Vowles)<br /><br />Massive Attack's \\"Superpredators\\" also appears in the opening credits of The Jackal to create the unsettling feel for the intense action film. \\"Superpredators\\" is a grinding, loud, and striking bonus track to the album (in Japan only), but became a popularly sought after track thanks to The Jackal.<br /><br />In the end, Mezzanine continues to have staying power in pop culture, and hopefully in home music collections as well. It's a rarealbum that begs the listener to stick through every track. The album is dark, brooding, sad, warm, calm, intense, striking, frantic, and just all kinds of awesome. Vastly different from beginning to end, Mezzanine is a collective mix of so many emotions and styles it's almost schizophrenically beautiful. If you have only heard individual tracks before, hopefully you'll pick up the album or give it a listen on Spotify.awesome.

B0059XTU22|4.0|The Hobbit has been on the minds of fans ever since we heard The Lord of the Rings would be made into films first. It's actually a very ambitious story to translate to film when you consider the book's intended demographic of children; whereas The Lord of the Rings was definitively a story for adults. However, director Peter Jackson seems to have a very clear idea of how to balance The Hobbit.<br /><br />The Hobbit seemed like a long time coming but it was well worth the wait. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is long. However it doesn't seem bloated. Despite a slower pace than the LOTR trilogy, it feels calmer and more deliberate. Utilizing an expanded story thanks to the Appendices, Unfinished Tales and Silmarillion, the characters and story feel more flushed out and not rushed. Yes there are changes from the book, (introducing an enemy for Thorin), but they don't ruin the movie. The pacing is refreshing. It gives the audience adequate breathing room between our action sequences and story development. While some may find the scenes with Radagast and Rivendell overly long, they actually work to successfully bridge The Hobbit to The Fellowship of the Ring just as intended. Whatever complaints I may have about the film are minimal when shown against the ultimate canvas of the finished product.<br /><br />The film is also wonderfully acted - particularly by Martin Freeman (Bilbo). It's whimsical, lighthearted and relaxed. It still has the emotional impact and tension at the right moments, something Jackson has gotten better at in each film. As expected, Sir Ian McKellan also gives a great performance as Gandalf the Grey. The mysterious yet playful Gandalf from The Fellowship of the Ring is back, but as equally suspicious of the growing doom of Middle-Earth. Additionally, the Riddles in the Dark scene was perfect and absolutely how I imagined it as a kid when I read the book. Andy Serkis (Gollum) and Freeman have wonderful chemistry and it provides another layer to the complexity of Gollum/ Smeagol.<br /><br />As for the High Frame Rate and visual aspect of the film, it's remarkable. At first it is a bit jarring. It seems almost too real and in that sense fake, but you then lose yourself and remember that life in fact actually looks like that! The Hobbit is crisp, bright and clean. Yes, there are times that the CGI seems a bit fake, but when the rest of the film is as beautiful, you don't give it a second notice. The 3D is used to expand the film visually and very rarely for sight gag and thanks to HFR is smooth and you forget it actually is 3D. It was an immense joy to watch. The scenery is beautiful and breathtaking. Echoing the travel scenes from Fellowship, The Hobbit also gives us glorious wide shots of the early journey and the HFR and 3D give it unimaginable scope.<br /><br />The film seems inevitable to divide people on the HFR vs standard 24 frames/ second, but Jackson may indeed have begun the change to a new cinema experience. Change is unsettling and people are inherently resistant to it, but when its all said and done, this is absolutely a film to see in the theaters; and more importantly one to be seen in HFR if you're lucky enough to have a theater projecting it in that format as Jackson intended it to be seen.<br /><br />Verdict: See In Theaters!<br /><br />[...]ollum/ Smeagol.

B0055PGUYU|5.0|My boss had all of his employees read this book, and I was not appreciating a &#34;have&#34; to read kind of book.  Once I finished (including the appendix), I was more than impressed with the study of our habits whether good or bad that influence our lives.  I bought this book for my son who is 22 and he stated that while reading it on his plane, it changed his thinking immediately!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Very competitive and action.  Thought provoking and family orientated game you'll love owning and playing.  Buy it now, you will not regret it!!

0316172324|5.0|I chose this rating because it deserved the best for exceptionally well-presented material.  Value to be had by any reader.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|Bought this product for a grandchild that wanted one, he'd seen it on TV. Grandson is 7 years old. It is an entertaining game for multiple players as well as one. Wish it had more pieces in it (legos) but other than that overall I was impressed. Yes I would recommend it to others.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|My husband and I bought one episode thinking we would give it a try and just see how it goes.  We then bought another, and then another.  Do yourself a favor and buy the entire series from the get go.  It's worth it.  I am so hooked on this show now and am looking forward to season 2.
0307593525|5.0|Bought this product for my son who wants to learn French cooking,he's 33. very charming set. Son is enjoying it. Books are nicer than they appeared on-line.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|For some reason, even though I log in with my Facebook account on both my phone and the Kindle, I don't have the colors that I've already purchased available on the Kindle app. In addition, this is a much older version of the app that doesn't work quite the same as the Android-phone app.
B004QPOVF0|5.0|So glad I got this for my husband. We both loved it very much and have already told others it was awesome. What a performance they put on!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|When I'm looking to waste time, I usually try to find a Bingo game of some sort. I'd played this on Facebook before, so I already  knew that it was halfway decent. The app is actually fairly good and works well on my Kindle Fire HD. It's fun enough, though you might have to ration out your prizes so that you can play again soon. That gets kind of irritating, when I'm looking to burn a few hours (yes, hours) playing Bingo because I've got nothing else to do.<br /><br />All in all, a good app. Great time-waster. Fun enough, though their background music is sometimes annoying. But the app is cute.
B003274QH6|5.0|When I first heard about this show and had seen an episode here and there (not in order) I was sort of interested in it but never got around to watching it. However recently my boyfriend and I watched seasons 1-5 within a matter of a week and a half because we became so hooked to this show it was ridiculous! We now get to watch the first 3 seasons every night and cannot wait for the next season to air. I would recommend this to anyone because I am VERY picky when it comes to tv shows and I very rarely get addicted to them but this one takes the cake. Loves me some BrBa!

He is one of the first (although there are MANY now) to write about<br />his  experiences doing past life regressions.  I would actually start with MANY LIVES MANY MASTERS, and then<br />read all his books including this one. Real life and love IS stranger than fiction!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Read it in two days. Loved it and highly recommend it to young people, and even the not so young.  I have boys the same age as the characters.  I felt that I could relate through my own remembered youth and through theirs.
B008WK30XO|5.0|I watched the movie and fell in love with the score. I had to purchase it right away! I would definitely recommend to music lovers!

B005I1AQ14|1.0|I would like to rate it, but the disc can't be played on our US machines. I have gotten a real education on Regions and color formats. This DVD being Region O is OK, but the color format was PAL, which will not play on our players here in the US, which is Region 1.<br /><br />To be able to play here, Regions 0,1 are good. But the color format must be NTSC, or it won't play!!!<br /><br />Why don't the media companies know those things? Why do they mail out DVD's knowing that PAL will NOT play here in the US? A waste of time and money. I have to eat the shipping on the four DVD's I have had shipped to me, all of them a birthday gift to a friend. Frustrating.<br /><br />H. F. Baker

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good book, but I would not let my kids read this until they are much older. I can't wait to see the movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My kids were introduced to this game from their cousin.  It quickly became one of their favorites.  I have even tried it and can figure out how to use it.  I am not nearly as good as my kids but at least I can play without getting stumped like some of the others they have.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|This series is mesmerizing!  Couldn't stop watching it and highly recommend it to anyone who likes intrigue, suspense, great acting.  Added bonus; you'll be on the right end of the &#34;What, you're not watching Homeland???&#34; conversation!

Enter the innocent scientist who did what she was told and neglects responsibility for the effects on the humans being tested. Jeremy Renner kidnaps here to &#34;save&#34; her and to get the formula needed to save his own life.......<br /><br />The themes seem old, though the acting was good. Rachael Weiz was excellent.
0765325950|1.0|I've really enjoyed this series and look forward to reading the book.  For TOR to so obviously attempt to force those of us who read ebooks to purchase a hardcover version shows what they really think about readers who have been faithful to this series for over 20 years.  Very disappointing.
B000KIPD5E|1.0|I have seven Dunlop-MXR pedals that have operated flawlessly for many years, plus one or two others from Visual Sound, Ibanez and the like. I took the AB 100 out of its blister pack, and got ready to insert the 9v battery. The battery clip fell apart: junk. I think that just about sums up the quality of this product.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This is a terrible book and it really is nothing but what used to be called a &#34; dirty book&#34;.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|It does not get any better for Star Wars fans. These are movies than can be viewed over and over again. Fantastic clarity and sound! Now the only thing that I have to add to my library--the Indiana Jones trilogy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Picked it up because it was on the best-seller's list for quite a while, but I didn't like the story. Didn't like the characters at all. At one point I started to feel bad for her and thought I could at least have that connection, but then something really outrageous would happen and all I could think was; &#34;who in the world would ever live like this couple?&#34; In the end I disliked both of the main characters and didn't think the book was worth the hype.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|That's the moral and point to the story.  Never have I read or watched anything that says it better or with more clarity.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Some of the tunes are not my style but I am a big supporter of Bocelli so I am happy to hear any of his work.  I am a professional musician and, from where I stand, he is an excellent artist on all levels.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very effective. Good sounds for resting or sleeping.. Some of the sounds repeat but it's barely noticeable. I'm very pleased with this app.
B009PQ5Y4M|5.0|This is a sci-fi film with all the nuances and details you could ever ask for in an epic movie. I love for the compelling story, the amazing visuals, the world the viewers are immersed into, and the characters! The acting is generally really amazing! Great movie.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked this book a lot because I felt it was an honest, heartfelt experience that was told or expressed with great care and truthfulness.  The experience was related in such a way as to make you feel a part of his life and as if you were a close friend or associate of his.  Good book!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This combo pack was a great bargain to get all three movies! Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the trilogy
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This movie will become a classic like Oh Brother Where art thou.  The producer did a great job putting you back into the time period.  The houses, clothes, cars and accent all go with that time period.  I really enjoyed the movie.  We watched it two times.  It could have done without a couple of scenes.  But otherwise awesome!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Kept me wanting to read. Definitely want to understand this world more and the relationships between the district's and the capital.
B0006FFRW0|5.0|This is a great album which I loved in the '90s. Its not my favorite album of all times, but its a great one with superb songs like Heresy, Reptile or Hurt.<br />Soundwise NIN always sound very good, but the 5.1 mix takes the album to a whole other level. You can really hear every detail and the rear surround give the album so much depth, its just incredible.<br />ITs like listening to a new album.<br /><br />If you have a surround system and a SACD (for the SACD version) or a DVDA player (for the dual disc version), you have to get this album. If you dont a DVD player will do for the dual disc, but for full hi rez you need the dvda player.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Okay plot.  Okay acting.  Entertaining.  Some interesting twists on time travel.  Happy I watched it, but wouldn't watch it twice.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|The Bourne Legacy had a surprising ending. I imagine the producers are allowing room for a continuation of this wonderful series. Jeremy Renner did a fabulous job.  I did miss Matt Damon in the movie though. Hope he comes back if the series continues.

B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Loved this movie. Great cast and done very well. Totally captures the grandeur of childhood and first relationships. Music is A++ as well. All typical for a Wes Anderson film. If you liked Royal Tenenbaums, then you would love this film.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is a quick and easy way to check my daily needs--instead of sticky notes all over the kitchen. Anyone can use this with ease!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Amazing series. Great follow up to season 2. Characters keep getting better and better. Can't wait for next half of the season.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Book was predictable but enjoyed reading it completely. Read in less than 2 days so that's gotta tell you something. Definitely download especially since its free on kindle.
0871164566|5.0|I have been doing bead working for several years now, but have been afraid to get into much wirework, in part because of the cost of metals going up. I am a visual learner, so I appreciate this book with it's pictures, and this makes it more comfortable to try wire work.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|This is a great movie from start to finish. It is a work of its time, but Bogart and Bergman are flawless. Claude Rains must have enjoyed his role because he really shines when he delivers his lines (especially the one-liners). I highly recommend this movie.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|Probably outstanding for youngsters who will find more of the stuff they want to see, but stuff I want to see as an old head, is a bit scarce. Found 2 George Clinton videos, but nothing when searching for Parliament/Funkadelic.  Video quality is great!!  When the library gets more extensive,  I will be fantastic.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|So cute.  My daughter loved it and her friends wanted to know where I got it from.  Thank for sending it so fast
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This is one if the few tv shows that have excellent writing and excellent acting as well! It is suspenseful, heartwarming, action packed and shocking all at the same time. I'm hooked!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This is a story about serious but real human dramas, interpersonal drifts, life turns and twists, psychological struggles and stark socio-temporal distinctions. The morals of this books are multitudinous, multidimensional and indispensable for every human.<br />The author is highly renowned for her elevated style and language, writing with masterly skill, and lively narrative.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Solid \\"Highlights\\"; doesn't include all the songs from the movie, but definitely still worth it if you enjoyed the film!
B004F77SHC|4.0|I purchase this for a xmas present for my ex-wife, my understanding is she loves it, so I guess the purpose was accomplish. But then again you cant go wrong if you give anything it has to do with this saga
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was an enjoyable game and it worked well on my kindle fire. i do wish there were a few more hidden object screens.
B004LWZW42|4.0|The movie quite obvious is a great movie, no complains on that side, however lately some dvd movies had been release with a very poor packaging (to the point of feeling CHEAP).<br />Still I like the purchase!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|After listening to Adam Makos being interviewed on the Diane Rehm show, I just had to get this book.  It reads like a suspenseful novel, and one sometimes forgets that it is entirely based on real events.  If you are interested in what pilots and their crews on both sides had to endure during WWII, this book is for you.  A real page turner.
0385484518|5.0|Probably my favorite book my Mitch Albom. Already had the soft cover, but wanted the hardcover for my collection. Excellent purchase!
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|This comedy was a bit different but in a good way.  Definitely not for kids.  I thought it was funny but a bit raunchy at times.
B009GESJH2|5.0|How can you go wrong with Kid Rock?! He is so talented and very enjoyable to listen to! Love him!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I gave it only 3 stars because the language was a bit too much!  Definitely not recommended for children. The story line wasn't bad, but the language used ruined it for me.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This is a fantastic and very exciting series and I cannot wait for season 5 to come out. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul deserve every award that they have received for their performances in this show.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Thank you so much it's so easy receiving my e mails on my tablet I love this app. go yahoo
B0067TGSOK|4.0|I liked the many case studies and ideas presented. Helpful to me in looking at opportunities. I would recommend this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  Such sweet friendship that is so unconditional and rock solid love.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|...but it gets pretty challenging as you progress through the courses.  I gave it a 5 star because it is a great game,,,but I dislike the fact that it is so challenging...that's a good thing, only...I like to win!!  Try this game!  You will grow to love it as I do!!  It makes you keep trying!  Enjoy!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|I have enjoyed playing the game. But the popup ads are very annoying and interference with playing the game. The game plays well the ads are a downfall.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|IN ORDER,TO PLAY THIS PROGRAM, I MUST REENTER THE PROGRAM AFTER EACH GAME IS COMPLETED.  I DID ENJOY THE GAMES WHEN I COULD PLAY!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is one of the best. Good sound track, and well acted. It is a feel good movie. I have seen most of the musical movies that have been out lately. This is at the top of the scale.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I COULD NOT LOAD THIS PROGRAM ON MY TABLET ( PAD TF300T).  I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES AND ALL I RECEIVED WAS THE BIRD!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved her Slammed series and didn't give a second thought to buying this (didn't even sample it first!).  About 75% thru it I was sobbing (at work...). It is extremely gripping and emotiionally draining, but that's just Colleen's style.  Couldn't put it down, even with other loaned titles in my library expiring.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Bought as a gift (his request) for my son in-law. So far, no compalints... so I guess it works and I bought the right movie and DVD works.Amazon shipped shipped right away and it arrived right away.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book was exceptionally written and well thought out. It never left me bored or even remotely dissatisfied and kept the action coming. I highly recommend it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|WOW.  This book was incredible.  It held me hostage because I could hardly put it down.  Really captivating.  This author is a very talented writer.
B000AARKW6|5.0|The holidays had passed and my friend was coming for dinner, I wanted to do something special. By ordering his favorite movie through Amazon. com I was able to surprise him with a special gift. The product came within a very short time and it was in pristine condition. Amazon not only has the best selection at a reasonable price, but they always make me look good!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is such a hard book to review. There is so much I could say, but I know I would simply ramble on and on about how wonderfully written this book is, how the characters affected me, how the story broke my heart but made me feel so happy.<br /><br />I smiled, I laughed and I cried buckets of joyful and heart wrenching tears.<br /><br />Will Traynor lived a full adventurous life, until it was cut short one rainy London day. Will is a quadriplegic who needs round-the-clock care for his physical ailments, but for his emotional state-of-mind his mother has hired Louisa Clark to be a companion to Will.<br />Louisa is a simple girl who has lived her entire 26 years in the shadows of Stortfold Castle. She likes to wear colorful clothes and bumble bee tights. She just lost her job at a caf&eacute;; her family relies on Louisa for income so she accepts a job as Will's care giver for a six month time period.<br /><br />What happens in this six month time period is the heart of this story. It is about two families and how they deal with what life has dealt them. It is about choices and being allowed to choose. It is about awakening and discovering life and all there is to take from it and not be afraid to really love and live.<br /><br />\\"Live boldly. Push yourself. Don't settle. Wear those stripy legs with pride.\\"<br /><br />So... I encourage you all to take this journey and...'do something else, to widen your horizons a bit.'
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I was trapped in this book the moment I started reading it. It is a horrible, devastating, inspiring, beautiful book. I read it in less than a day.
B0096DZKZC|2.0|Well...I could not even get my game to work.<br />But I guess I could be a nice game if It would work for me.
0670026603|5.0|Lou Clark enjoys her life in her small English hometown. Her family, ever teetering on financial disaster, is close. Patrick, her boyfriend and sure to eventually become Lou's husband, is a nice man, even though Lou simply tolerates his continual quest to become a perfect specimen of an athlete. Lou has a sparring yet loving relationship with her brilliant sister, Treena. Unexpectedly pregnant, Treena has returned home from college and now lives in the Clarks' crowded little house with her son. Lou cherishes her job as a waitress in the Buttered Bun Café, where she has formed friendships with her regular customers.<br /><br />However, everything changes on the day her boss calls her in to deliver terrible news: He is closing the café for good. Lou is in shock as she returns home. She knows her parents depend on her salary to get by. Her mother looks after Lou's grandfather, who lives with them, so she can't work. Her father's job is in constant jeopardy, with probable lay-offs looming. Typical of their relationship, Lou must literally run laps with Patrick while she confides her worries to him. She is not comforted by Patrick's notion that she could become a beautician because she's \\"pretty enough.\\"<br /><br />At the Job Center, the news is grim. Lou spends a few nights as a fill-in at a chicken processing plant and also works for a sketchy company that appears to be bent on selling questionable energy suppliers to seniors. Her job counselor wonders if she would be interested in a career as a pole dancer or \\"adult chat line supervisor.\\" Lou is aghast at these possibilities, which makes the next open position considerably more appealing than it might have been otherwise: \\"Care and companionship for a disabled man.\\" It turns out that the employer is a quadriplegic who simply needs someone with him during the day to help him...and the pay is quite good. Of course, Lou has reservations. She is not keen on wiping bottoms, but when offered the job --- as a temporary six-month position --- she can't turn it down.<br /><br />Lou is off to a bumpy start the day she meets Will Traynor, who is now in a wheelchair, sidelined from his mountain-climbing, bungee-jumping, high-stakes-career life. Will is unhappy and certainly doesn't mind making Lou miserable by either ignoring her or snapping at her. Lou longs to quit the job, but her family is desperate for the paycheck. Eventually Lou discovers shocking news about Will, revelations that make her change her focus. She becomes determined to take him on adventures that will show him what he can still attain in spite of his disability. Meanwhile, as the two draw closer, Will tries to convince Lou that she can change her own future, enlarging it from the pleasant but ordinary fate to which she is resigned.<br /><br />ME BEFORE YOU has every quality a page-turner should have, in spades. Author Jojo Moyes pulls readers immediately into Lou's world, handily eliminating that \\"I know if I keep reading, eventually I'll be hooked\\" phase sometimes encountered in books. Lou is a particularly endearing character with a sassy sense of humor, heavy on the self-deprecation, and readers cannot help but feel for her. This is an unusual and emotional love story melded with a satisfying coming-of-age tale that is utterly irresistible.<br /><br />Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is one of the absolute best games I have ever played. Iv played it through 3 times now &amp; I still love it. The story was so good I actually cried a little at the end. I wont say why because it would ruin the end. But man was I sad. Get this game &amp; find out why. I bet u at least want to cry little. The graphics are great &amp; the puzzles makes sense &amp; are fun. Hidden object scenes are clear. Everything about this game is perfect. My favorite thing was the cut scenes in the beginning when you first meet your little friend. The quality of these cut scenes is so good its like watching a movie. I just wish they were longer. They were kinda creepy too, which I loved.
0446554995|4.0|There aren't many protagonists in modern thriller fiction like FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast. He appears to be an albino, speaks with the fine lilt and charm of a southern gentleman, possesses a steel-trap mind that rivals Sherlock Holmes, and is full of enough secrets that no reader who has followed his numerous exploits ever feels like they know him.<br /><br />TWO GRAVES is the latest Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child novel to prominently feature Pendergast. Along with any Pendergast book, of course, comes Detective Vincent D'Agosta. Make no mistake, though: the book firmly belongs to Pendergast. Heartbroken at the apparent death of his wife Helen, he is more than surprised to find her alive when he comes across her in the hands of German abductors in Central Park.<br /><br />During a brief and violent confrontation, Pendergast must relive his pain and anguish as Helen is killed before his eyes. He believes he knows the group behind this murderous act and vows to avenge Helen. It is this motivation that brought about the title for the novel, taken from a quote by Confucius that reads \\"Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.\\"<br /><br />While Pendergast plots his revenge, his services are called upon by D'Agosta and the NYPD.  They need help tracking down a new and particularly dangerous serial killer dubbed the Hotel Killer. This individual not only kills his victims but also mutilates their bodies, cutting them into several pieces. What makes his M.O. unique is that at each murder scene the police find an additional body part, apparently coming from the killer's own body.Pendergast believes he recognizes this deadly handiwork as being that of his evil brother, Diogenes. Further investigation reveals that he is partially right. The killer is a blood relative, but it is his son who is behind these murders. The only problem for Pendergast is that he never knew he had a son.<br /><br />The Hotel Killer case slowly evolves into the murder of Helen Pendergast, and the answers are to be found deep in the forests of South America. What leads him there is a young man named Tristram, who turns out to be his son and the Hotel Killer's twin, now revealed to be Alban. The body parts found at each murder scene have come from the body of Tristram. Pendergast takes off for Brazil to a place called Nova Godoi, where time has stood still, circa the 1940s. The Nazi party is alive and well and experimenting once again. Their aim is to create a master race utilizing the production of twins --- one to represent the group called Der Bund, and the other merely kept around for parts. Pendergast must not only infiltrate this super-secret society but also face off with his evil offspring Alban.<br /><br />TWO GRAVES provides readers exactly what they would expect from a Preston and Child novel --- thrills, high adventure, treacherous plot twists and well-researched scientific intrigue. The story is never predictable, and Pendergast is a multi-layered personality who keeps you guessing throughout.<br /><br />Reviewed by Ray Palen
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It never had a bad part. I would recommend this book to  everyone. I loved it all did not dislike anything at all.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What a crazy read, trying to figure out the book before, during and after reading, you will not stop talking about this book that is for sure!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I hope this app comes fast because my kids get on my kindle to so please hurry up on it !!!!!! I need it now.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoyed these puzzles and worked them as a way to relax before bed.  Some are quite difficult and took lots of time to solve.  Others were very simple. A good variety.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|If you like Glee and you like Christmas, you'll like this. Doing what they do best, they album offers wonderful renditions of Christmas standards.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The program came pre downloaded on the kindle. I really don't use it. I prefer the full screen on the computer better.
B004J64QSI|5.0|An outstanding production and the final 10 minutes is one of the grandest scenes in history!  Recommended for all who appreciate musicals and very light opera.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I am not really into the whole angry birds thing but since it was free I downloaded it. It is ok.
B002MU4NLI|5.0|Excellent Quality B&W version.  Best I've seen yet.  Was very pleased with the video quality compared to other attempts I've seen.  Not much else to say about the story; it's a classic after all.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book. Pulled at the heart strings. The ending was a tear jerker. Couldn't put it down. Totally worth the money spent.
030758836X|1.0|Bought this hardcover book as my development's book club is currently reading this.  I'm not even going to attend the next meeting as this was a story about two neurotic, self-centered people wasting their own lives with a bunch of nonsense. I'm not wasting anymore time with them! Sorry I read the book. Wish there was a '0' star rating available.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I got this trilogy as a Christmas gift and it arrived so quickly! You couldn't beat the price, either. When I purchased it, it was a little cheaper than it is now ($20) but I'd pay the price that it is up for now all day! A great group of movies.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have read all of Jon Grisham's books with enthusiasm but was slightly disappointed in this new book - while the story is good, there is no real tension that builds for the reader.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is for my 10 year old daughter. She can't stop playing this. Hope this helps if you have a child 10 years old or so
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|This movie was bad and the only reason it was filmed is the money to be from the name recognition.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I do not normally purchase single episodes, but my husband and I watched the entire show last year on Netflix and we didn't get to catch all the way up. I do however find myself asking &#34;Will we EVER meet the mother?&#34;
B008MM9630|5.0|I like this game for passing time.my only issue is the game keeps telling me I was logged in from another location.
0345803485|1.0|If I could give this book minus stars, I would give it a minus 50. The writing was so terrible I could not even get through the first chapter and promptly threw it in the trash. The female lead character, Amanda, is a twenty something year old virgin. She meets Christian and goes on and on and on about how she doesn't understand why he makes her feel this way and just what are these amazing feelings and why does she feel this way. What, is she 11?? No one in their 20's talks like that unless they were raised in a cave by mute wolves. I could go on and on and on about what a stink bomb this book is, but it's made a gazillion dollars for EL James, so some must like it. I say, don't waste your money like I did.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got compliments the first time I took this backpacker out. It keeps your camera and accessories very organised and intact without them falling on each other. As a budding documentary filmmaker, this is just what I needed to move around without being too bulky. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|My 10 year old asked for this for Christmas and he really liked it. He also got the holiday post office set.
B005LAII80|5.0|I JUST FINISHED WATCHING DREDD! RENTED FROM REDBOX! IT IS AWESOME AND I'M READY TO BUY IT. I DON'T DO 3D DUE TO HEALTH ISSUES SO I'M AFRAID NOW TO BUY THIS ONE BECAUSE IT SAYS 3D SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAS REGULAR BLU RAY AS WELL! UGG! I JUST KNOW THIS MOVIE ROCKED IT. URBAN IS AWESOME AS DREDD! THEY DID A FANTASTIC JOB ON THIS MOVIE! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! I DON'T KNOW WHY IT DIDN'T DO AS WELL AT THE BOX OFFICE EITHER.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy to play. Very user friendly. Love the options. Have spent hours playing and still playing. Would recommend this game to anyone who loves to play solitaire.
B005LAII12|2.0|I LOVE MARK AND WHAT'S HER HEAD BUT THIS MOVIE IS SUCKING FOR ME :( IT'S ONLY BEEN ON ABOUT 20 MINUTES OR SO AND I'M READY TO FAST FORWARD. IT'S NOT FUNNY AT ALL. LIKE ANOTHER VIEWER SAID IT'S JUST STUPID. OH WELL.. I STILL LOVE MARK AND WHAT'S HER HEAD :) I HAD A BRAIN FART AND FORGOT HER NAME! AND FYI.. THE BOYS WOULD BE CLEANING UP THE POO IN THE FLOOR!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I haven't been this enthralled with a book in years. I loved the disastrously warped and witty characters who constantly surprised me. I'm still shocked and delighted by every train wreck twist. This novel is a must-read for those looking for an intelligent, shocking mystery that hugs the dark side of the human mind.
B0052N3ERQ|5.0|Calculator is advanced enough for scientific and engineering applications, yet easy enugh for anyone to use.<br /><br />This was recommended to me by a colleague - for a techie, it is well worth the upgrade to \\"Pro\\"
B007KOMTUI|3.0|there was a tip that runs quickly across screen that tells you to disable screensaver prior to viewing. first of all, i'm not sure how to do this and didn't want to mess up PC. But the constant stopping and moving the mouse was driving me crazy!! The quality of the HD episode was just as poor as the regular so I saved the dollar and kept watching regular episodes. I was a little disappointed in the ending. Not sure what I expected but it felt &#34;off&#34;.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|This was really hard to get through at first but don't be discouraged because once you get into the flow it's really great.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The special effects of the movie were fine, but I'm afraid that I've become weary of the constant violence. It was one thing when it was in the comic books, but IMHO, the realism portrayed in movies is not good: to wit, the murders at its opening in Colorado.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Loved the movie!  I really like Amy Adamd and Clint Eastwood was cast very well.  Would recommend this to anyone!
098555780X|5.0|I've been watching J.D.'s TIAT videos for months, recently bought and read about half of Disturbingly Normal and just bought this book and thumbed through, he is a truly talented guy.  You can find some of the knots on his youtube channel but the book was still worth 100% of the money just to support all he does.  The pictures are very clear and the directions couldn't be better. Can't wait for the next book
B00A3VLJCE|3.0|So far I haven't had much luck with getting Photoshop Touch to do much. Perhaps it is due to my phone (Galaxy Nexus) or perhaps it is just me, but I find that if you want to do simple things like fix red-eye on a photo you're better off just doing it on a PC than a phone.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Received DVD this morning and decided to get right on with it , did easier on level one and managed to keep up although as I have a hip problem so did march instead of doing all jumping jacks , thoroughly enjoyed it , I didn't feel like I had done 20 mins went very fast , and on the plus side even now two hours later still feeling like I've actually worked out :-) like having an easy and hard version as well and the fact that Jillian talks you through as some DVD's where they have two levels you just get told to watch .<br />Looking forward to doing it again tomorrow , have done weight and measurements so hoping to see some changes next week :-)
B008ALA6DW|4.0|If you are trying to plug your MacBook Pro retina into the network, while running Windows 7, be sure to first BOOT your computer with this adapter plugged in. I have been unable to get mine working while plugging it in when the machine is already booted.<br /><br />I haven't had this problem on MacOS but I rarely use it there either.<br /><br />This adapter is a great option if you want the speed and reliability of a wired connection.
B00785P2QC|4.0|My son downloaded this game for the kindle fire and it runs perfectly.  A good game for anyone over 8 I think. He likes to check on his city everyday.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft! You can have monster mode or peaceful mode when you're on survival. On creative you can fly and have unlimited resources. I've had this game for like 2 months and I can't stop playing.  You won't be disappionted.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|I received the 4-disc 3D Blu-ray of the Avengers.  I'm not reviewing the film.  There's Metacritic for that.  I'm reviewing the product itself.  This is the first of two Disney titles (the other being the 4-Disc 3D Blu-ray of Frankenweenie) where the case itself only holds two discs, so the discs are stacked on top of one another.<br /><br />I'm sorry for complaining, but Disney is a billion dollar company.  I'm paying more for the version with more discs, and there's been past entries by Disney where they've included a plastic piece to attach more discs to.  It's a petty way to cut corners.<br /><br />Rant over.
B003IK71DS|5.0|I know of no better record. buy the L.P. to get all the texture and dynamics this album is huge!!!
B005LAIIA8|1.0|I received the 4-disc 3D Blu-ray of Frankenweenie.  I'm not reviewing the film.  There's Metacritic for that.  I'm reviewing the product itself.

0345803485|1.0|I ordered the book on a recomendation - this is not the type of books i norally read. i gave it away.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is great i love to play it when im bored it really entertains me since im only 11 i know how much all your kids love this game so i hope you try it out
B009WO7NQO|5.0|A fun twist on the angry birds with a star wars theme . What's not to love ? If you like angry birds , or star wars , you'll like this.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|I feel in love with this show from the beginning! Theres sex, ghosts, and suspense. You could not ask for a more original idea for a network tv show!
B002SR2PKG|5.0|This book will scare you into sleeping with the lights on.  In my opinion this was the peak of King's writing.  Newer books seem to pale by comparison.
0790749815|5.0|This is a great movie! I love Alfred Hitchcock films and I love Cary Grant so this was just another addition to my collection!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This puzzle game is so different from all the other jigsaw puzzles. The graphics are great. There are several different picture packs to choose from, like stained glass, wood, there are 7 different packs plus 2 secret packs and each level has many puzzles. You can complete each puzzle at your own pace,at the end of each level it gives you the option to take the challenge and you do same puzzles only they are timed which is very challenging. This game is very relaxing and can be very challenging. If you like jigsaw type puzzles you should get this game. It's well worth the money.Also from the main menu you can play fever mode which is very challenging.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Hilarious! This movie is great! It made me laugh and remember things about being a kid and falling in love for the first time. I found myself so engrossed with the characters and I even laughed out loud! Great Film!!
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|I think this is the worst movie Matthew McConaughey has ever played in. The movie did not really have a plot, it just ran on and on and never really went any where!  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B00005JJX8|5.0|I love Alfred Hitchcock films and I love Cary Grant so this was just another addition to my collection! :D
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book compared to the others was quite boring.  Wonderful ending. I couldn't be happier with it.<br />I can't say it wasn't perfect.
B008KE3960|5.0|If you like tower defense games and own a Kindle Fire, you will enjoy playing this title, as Amazon has invested in a quality game to showcase Kindle's gaming chops.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I love The Hunger Games books and the movie; however, I will not be ordering movie on Amazon in the future. The movie quality was HORRID. The player said I had a weak WiFi signal, but I had a full signal and never moved my laptop.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I buy cases and covers for all my portable electronics, and this case for my Kindle Fire is perfect.  As other reviewers have noted, it is not bulky, and therefore does not plus size this svelte tablet, however, the device is firmly held and well protected by the quality materials.  The fold over case with elastic band is a brilliant design that is very functional, easy to use by the entire family, and should hold up for a long time.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|One of those books that make you stay up late! Very thought provoking. I am making friends read it so I have people to talk to about it!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game is little more than a fun but simple puzzle. The concept is pretty neat - connect dots with the same color without crossing each color's path, Tron style - but the free levels are so easy to solve that they can get boring very quickly.
B00634GHJA|4.0|I was surprised that this really works but it does.  I was able to transfer the photos from my phone to my computer without cords and without e-mailing them.  Worked quickly.
B00ADYYY50|5.0|This album was straight with a good intro and frist song to start off the album with. loved the hit \\"let it go\\" with Akon... Never thout I would see them together. Also we have the banger with Lola and my all time favorite \\"up on it\\". BEST WIZ ALUM!
B00003CXWU|5.0|A GOOD JD MOVIEW.  LOVE HIS CO-STAR.  THEY WORK WELL TOGETHER.  FULL OF DRAMA AND A GOOD STORY LINE.  WOULD RECOMMEND, THOUGH I AM NOT FOND OF &#34;blow&#34; MYSELF.
B008NEVP1S|3.0|Anything by Aimee Mann is far superior than material by her peers, yet she is sounding a bit stale these days.  I miss the excitement of \\"Whatever\\" and the greatness of \\"Magnolia\\".  I do not think this material or performance matches up to  many of her past releases.  It sounds often as if Aimee is just \\"going through the motions\\".  I do think it was a HUGE disservice of her official website to deny fan comments.  There is no longer communication by fans on Aimee's site, which makes me suspicious that her management was fearful of negative reactions regarding this release.  It is always sad when a great independent artist decides to move in a corporate direction, by taking fans out of the equation.
6303407188|3.0|I AM NOT A FAN OF SJP, BUT LOVE JD.  HE PLAYS A CORNY CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE, THAT IS FOR SURE, SO IF YOU LIKE CORNINESS, THE THIS IS YOUR MOVIE TO WATCH! :)
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Saw the musical twice, then the screen treatment with the big stars singing as they acted out the roles.  This album captures the latter perfectly.  Highly recommend seeing the film and buying the album as a remembrance.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|This was the other gift for my 14 month old grandson along with the car transporter. Again, a huge hit and he plays with both every day. Also, my son and his wife love the quality of the items.
B009KHCRVO|5.0|This is a ridiculously fun movie. It is also far more excellently done than any of us anticipated. We watched it twice in one weekend. Enjoy!
B008XNZMOU|1.0|Never before have I cared for Taylor Swift as an artist, but after this album came out, I was set in my opinion of her. Some may say my views are a bit biased, considering how I frequently listen to a genre far different from Taylor's, but I am generally very open about music. I was very disappointed with this album, (and I TRULY DID listen to this whole album) along with all her others, because of many reasons I shall list here:<br /><br />1. Lyrical content. You can't expect much depth in artists nowadays, so this part of the review may seem a bit unnecessary. In the song \\"We Are Never, Ever Getting Back Together,\\" Taylor has written some very interesting lyrics. Ones to impress generations and generations after ours, and to teach them important aspects of life (sarcasm, for those who didn't notice). One part of the song reads, \\"You go talk to your friends talk, To my friends talk to me, But we are never ever ever ever getting back together,\\" and it ends with \\"Like, ever.\\" Now there's a few parts of that song that bother me. First, it's the repetition of \\"never ever.\\" Not only does this lack creativity and expression, it also leaves no room for interpretation of the symbolism in her lyrics. Meaning, that she dumbs down her lyrics so anyone can understand them plainly, rather than actually requiring you to use your brain. The part that really exasperates me is the \\"like, ever\\" portion. Not only is the word \\"like\\" used incorrectly, the stupidity of that phrase just kills me. What kind of right-minded lyricist uses \\"like, ever?\\" It's beyond me. The structure of this song and the others on this album are very similar, and my opinion of the lyrics in this song are directed to all songs on the album. An example of ideal lyrics would be from the band Wintersun. The band chosen has no significance, but the lyrics were chosen specifically for their literacy, being artistic, and quite the opposite of Taylor's usual lyric style. \\"So old I've become - Thousand years staring into emptiness, But now I realize - That it was just an illusion.\\" Not the best of lyrics out there, but already better than those on this album. These are high quality lyrics, and careful deliberation was used in creating them (and they don't make anything near $35 million a year!).<br /><br />2. Instruments. Of course the point of the album may not be focused on great musicianship, but I figured I would write about my opinion on it anyway. To use an example, I'll talk about the first song on the album, \\"State of Grace.\\" The drums sounded as if they were created by a drum machine. Maybe they were, maybe they weren't, but it's the fact that it gives that sort of sound to the song(s) that makes it such a let-down. The simple drum beat used in the songs on this album could have easily been done by a toddler, and the simplicity takes away from any sort of life that could have been in the song. The fact that there was no variation to the drum patterns, and that the sound quality of it was so low, makes this album sound cheap and bland. The guitar segments were a disappointment in their own. I wasn't the biggest fan of Taylor's previous albums, but she at least had that prominent acoustic guitar sound that made her tracks sounds more rich, higher quality, and less...\\"Indie Pop,\\" if you would like to call it that.<br /><br />3. Lastly, genre. It has been mentioned by other reviewers before, but it's true. Taylor changed from her smooth, rich, almost-country sound into an Indie Pop-esque, generic singer. The beats, the singing style [(a lot of soft-singing, rather than her normal, clear, obnoxious vocals. (Not intentionally insulting her voice, but that's the only way I could describe it properly)], and the quality has turned her from a younger-generation, pop-country artist into some over-rated Indie artist. The sad part is, no one really noticed the change.<br /><br />Die-hard Swift fans will be die-hard Swift fans, and they will just eat up anything she s***s out. Wake up, people. The quality and content of our modern music is going rapidly downhill. Pull yourselves out of the shallow end and start appreciating music for other reasons, not just because of a catchy beat. Those that are attracted and pulled in by a song with strictly a catchy beat, written by millionaires just to make a buck, are sheep. Anyone can be sucked into a song played on the radio multiple times, but it takes a truly deep individual to pick out the songs that mean something, or that take great musicianship to produce.<br /><br />Those that think writing a nasty response to my review is going to hurt me are wrong. This is strictly my opinion, and you can take it or leave it. I tried to leave it in the kindest way possible, with respect, not to hurt anyone's feelings or cause anger, but to spark some change into someone. If not, you're free to enjoy Taylor Swift all you want. There is nothing wrong with it if you truly do enjoy her music. That is all.p, people.

B000JQUZCI|5.0|This is the first book I read on the Kindle. The writing style is very old school but the Kindle built in dictionary makes it easier to read. Both the Monster and Dr. Frankenstein are very different than those we grew up with on the silver screen. I like these better.
B00APOSIEQ|5.0|As a long term developer (30yrs) but only recently moving into this 'web stuff', I found this to be a much better explanation of CSS than I've been able to find through online searches. I'd recommend it to anyone with some development background that wants to get a good detailed overview in one place.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great espionage thriller.  You've gotta love Mitch Rapp -- a shoot-em up guy with a conscience!  Let's me be vicariously violent without having moral issues.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Wonderful read. I felt I was watching each seedy scene from a window, wiping away the fog to peer into a world so vastly different from my own. Those Hollywood Hills are almost visible from my Mississippi home.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for one of my grandsons.  He loved it.  I did not get to play with it.
086571701X|5.0|This gives all the details you need to set up an aquaponic system<br />My system is up and running great thanks to this book
0765325950|5.0|I am writing this review as a statement to all those who are bringing the review down because of no E-book. WHO CARES!!! Did you not read the first BOOKS on paper??? Just because they did not release the book in E-book format does not mean that they do not care about their customers. Do they release paperbacks at the same time as hardback??? NO. You know why?? Because they do not get as much money as the hard cover books. If this is how Robert Jordan fans are going to act, then just do us all a favor and read a Stephen King or Dean Koontz book and SHUT UP ABOUT IT! I have been a fan of Robert Jordan's work for 25+ years. I own a Kindle. I paid for the HARDBACK because of the fact that as a TRUE fan, I want to own them in HARDBACK. If you would just quit your crying and whining and just pick up the BOOK, then maybe you will find that IT IS A GREAT BOOK AND SERIES. No matter what, remember that Robert Jordan did this for his fans, and died trying to please his fans and that Brandon Sanderson continued the strenuous work for the FANS. So...what I am saying is, suck it up and buy the book or wait.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I highly recommend her books to all...she really weaves a lovely story.  Wish I could just stay home and read all day!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I was a little let down.  I guess my expectations were high due to the fact that this has been made into a movie.  I've had this on my reading list for a long time, but never bought it.  The movie inspired me to read it, but it was not as good as all the marketing suggests.  I have not seen the movie, but the previews give away a lot of the basic plot.  I guess I wanted something a bit more philosophical, and inspiring.  I found the plot building at the beginning of the book a bit slow.  I did finish the book, so it kept me interested in the conclusion.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game and I play it for free.  ADDICTIVE and oh so easy to play.  Fun for all ages and I highly recommend it.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|A lady I work with recommend thigs book, it definitly shines more light on Jaycee's story, and how she was forced to live.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|It's a good game to kill time! It's interesting enough to keep myself and kids entertained graphics are great. If u are looking for app/game for yourself and kids to enjoy this is it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved that I was able to buy all three books at once and that it was cheaper than buying them all three individually.  Great trilogy, would recommend it to almost anyone.
B00AMS38YU|5.0|I saw this Movie in the theaters and this Movie Nails it! Fast paced and good acting. praying for Squeal.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I feel like this book is the most predictable of the three.  Loved the first one, the second was great, but I feel that this one is just ok.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was beautifully written in my opinion. I liked getting the story from each character's perspective. Nick is such a hard guy to figure out and Amy is just crazy. I so wanted more after I read the last page. I really wanted Nick to get his justice and for Amy to finally be beaten but I guess it was not in the cards. If there was ever a sequal I would read it.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Love it! What a great and imaginative show! And so much better than 90% of what's on TV these days :S
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Excellent picture quality. It's like watching the movie again for the first time. The Star Wars fans are too harsh when it comes to reviewing the franchise products. The changes are minor and not much of an issue in my opinion. Just sit, watch and enjoy a great set of movies.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Very fun game with the exception that you are usually looking for the same things again and again; that ends up being helpful because you start noticing objects more easily! Fun, but glad I got it as the app of the day.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|One of the best batman movies! Had to buy to add to my collection. I'm sure they'll be a Robin spin off sequel.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Nice, but said it was free. Then you only get so far and they want you to either buy it or give you one level for advertising on Facebook. Not worth the price so i did not buy.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|While this movie might be geared toward men it is an excellent movie for families. Even my 9 year old son can watch and learn what it means to be a man of God. While he will ultimatly learn this from his father it helps for him to see other men like these guys living out their faith
B009NXV2RK|3.0|Decades after I first read a damp and sandy Clancy paperback on a beach, I tried the latest Clancy on a Kindle by the pool.  A good holiday read that kept me entertained but more like meeting an old friend's kid that catching up with the friend I had lost in the past.  The promise of youth awaits.  Looking forward to the next adventure.
B005KR6OB2|4.0|Disks themselves are in stellar condition. Some of the outer sleeves were damaged. My disks have all of the special features (another commenter said theirs didn't?). It took FOREVER for them to get here (several weeks from GoHastings) but I'll deal since the price was so awesome. Good way to get the whole thing without spending $20 per season.
B00867GKF8|5.0|Albert Brooks! Thank you very much! Item came in just perfect, brand new and good price! What else i can ask for.<br />Thank you!<br />Vt.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very cute and fun game. I'm stuck playing it every free moment. Got turned on by an 9 year old girl hahaha she lied it too.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Because all the violence and cruelty, I don't think is such a good story for young people. But is an imaginative and exciting plot that keeps you wanting to read more as you root for the heroine.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Not as fun as angry birds,  just an ok game. Its is priced right free. There are worst gamesbout there.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought that even with all the bad things I had heard about this book that it was written extremely well and I'm very upset that it is over. I know they won't do it but I wish it would become a movie in the future.
1569765677|4.0|Anyone who seeks knowledge and a further insight on the horrors of the correctional system of the United States should unquestionably read this!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was wonderful. Amazing. You will love it. You must read it. The fact that you're reading this tells me you're interested
1400049628|4.0|Good read, that had me chuckling and my imagination running wild.  If you take it light heartedly like you should if you are reading a zombie book, Max goes into great detail about how to defend/prepare oneself for the zombie apocalypse.  I had me in stitches a few times.<br /><br />It is a great companion to his world war z book, which is a must read(soon to be a movie).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This has got to be the best book I've ever read!!! I would recommend it to everyone. It has passion and suspense.... I couldn't put the book down.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Im happy us Kindle Fire users FINALLY have a real Facebook. To me its just as good as the iOS app!
B0088P2A7A|5.0|This app does a great job of providing access to one of the Web's greatest resources. As our online world grows more commercialized, please consider giving a small contribution to a site which we could scarcely imagine existing now.
B004M9ZI0M|4.0|I thought this a good interpretation with fantastic photography and scenery set in the Hawaiian Islands.  Mirren is an adequate Prospero, but this is not one of her great roles.  The standouts are the actors playing Miranda and Ferdinand.  Enjoy.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel has given considerable resources to this app, elegantly providing access to its peerless weather resources. It can use your device's location services to give you local weather, and if you travel like I do then you can save locations you will be visiting.
B0099114WO|5.0|Good movie and very informative. My work in the field of Family Counseloring help me take another look at some trying issues that I have noticed in various couples I am in session with.
B0056XME46|5.0|This was the authentic Apple product. It does what it supposed to do, and it is what it claims to be.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show keeps me in suspense, never knowing who's going to make the next move to try to outwit the other.<br />It's the best tv show series i've watched in a long time..Emily is the best!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Worth every penny; fantastic DVD abnd the CD kicks butt.  Highly recommended.  Get a glass of wine, put in dvd player, snuggle with your sweetie and enjoy the magic the songs have.
B0041KVZ18|5.0|I'm glad a reissue of this came out.  It's my wife's favorite album and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg to hear it on vinyl now.

0307719219|5.0|The core theme here is not new:  sustained prosperity arises where there is pluralistic government under the rule of law.  To the extent a society approaches this structure, which the authors call \\"inclusive,\\" it develops inclusive--ie, open-- economic institutions, where no elite can obstruct progress.  This is contrasted with \\"extractive\\" economies, stultified by political elites who repress the \\"creative destruction\\" that drives growth but threatens their power.<br /><br />The authors mostly avoid such terms as \\"democracy,\\" \\"free markets,\\" and \\"capitalism\\" because their chronicle covers thousands of years and those are modern concepts.  But at bottom, those are the ideals the authors are aiming at.<br /><br />So this is the latest in a long line of works by the likes of  Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Ludwig Von Mises, Frederick Hayek, Milton Friedman, Mancur Olsen, and Francis Fukuyama.  Does it add anything?  Yes it does, quite a lot.<br /><br />The contribution here is to chronicle the historical correlation between \\"inclusiveness\\" and prosperity; and conversely between \\"extraction\\" and decline.  It is a feast of historical anecdotes proving the correlation.<br /><br />For example, those who argue that riches or poverty are determined by culture, or religion, or natural resource endowment, or  geography, need only look at two borders:  those between Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Senora; and North Korea and South Korea.  It is politics, not any of those other things, that is decisive.<br /><br />The authors' theory is deterministic in the sense that ONCE inclusive political and economic institutions are in place, progress is assured; and conversely, as long as a society remains extractive, decline is assured.<br /><br />But on the question of HOW societies BECOME inclusive, the theory is not deterministic at all.  On the contrary, such developments are episodic and contingent, the result of \\"critical junctures\\" such as the Black Death (which shifted power from the landlords to the laborers) or the opening of Atlantic trade routes (which undercut chartered monopolies) or the Glorious Revolution of 1688 (which cemented the supremacy of Parliament and the rule of law); or specific personalities (such as the enlightened tribal chiefs of Botswana at independence in 1966 or Deng Xiaoping in Red China in the late 70s); and luck.<br /><br />How do they fit their theory to Communist China, a politically extractive but economically partially-inclusive society that is experiencing dramatic growth?  It won't last, they say, unless there is vast political change.<br /><br /> China has prospered because \\"there was a lot of catching up to do.\\"  It could exploit existing technology and foreign investment by loosening the economy just enough.  But there is no creative destruction in China.  The Party still holds its fist over every important enterprise, and every entrepreneur still needs party permission and support to succeed.  And the surest way to become rich is to be a high party official.  This makes the authoritarian system a spoils game, and will incite upheaval and instability as factions contend for power.  We'll see, but I'm convinced.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the writing style is more pedestrian than inspired.  It needs a sharp-penciled editor.  But other Great Works are more obscurely written--Marx's \\"Capital\\" and Keynes's \\"General Theory\\" are lead examples.<br /><br />Anyone who writes a book that Explains Everything sets himself up like an elk in a wolfpack. A lot of people will be threatened by this book and they will nibble and nitpick at it in the way creationists attack evolution.  The rejoinder is straightforward:  if you disagree, produce your own historical chronicle impeaching this one.  We will wait a long time.

B006M9NJFG|5.0|This is above and beyond any canteen I've ever owned. The build on it isn't cheap. All the materials are very strong. The price may be steep for a canteen, but this is worth every penny! Every piece on this is very well crafted. Make sure to wash it a few times though just to get the plastic smell out. That's almost a given with any new product though. I'd rather clean it myself then have the factory take care of it as some other reviews suggested. Zero leaks. The other cheap army surplus canteens are such cheap plastic and the smell doesn't go away, but this thing is seriously so durable. I can't express it enough how well made this is. Can't wait to take it out backpacking and hunting. I'll write an update after I use it on my winter camping trip in a few weeks!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I missed the movie before this one but while this movie was longer than most movies....it seemed so very long...
B004DM0UII|5.0|i just started using it. so far i like what it can do. the variety it allows me to pick from is fantastic thanks!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really like these type of games. I do not care too much for the search and find aspect, but this game lets you play another mini-game in lieu of the search game. I have only played the free version.  Cannot get the purchased version to load yet.

B009K0P10K|5.0|My friends recommended this show and after watching the first epside I completed the first season in a few days,  I've been catching up on season 2 on amazon and I'm still hooked.
0812993292|4.0|When I first began reading this I was thinking it was going to be just like Richard Paul Evans books on his walk about 3 part journey and wasnt excited.  However, this story is slow at first but gets much better and everything ties together in the end.  Harold leaves home for a very specific reason and has a long journey ahead.  It kind of also reminded me of the movie Forrest Gump and his travels.  The story looks at his life and his wifes life and how this journey made him remember things in his past he had forgotten.  Currently my mother is in hospice and dying of cancer and it was rather hard to read at times with the things going on in my life but I think I am glad I read it.  At times some of the situations are unrealistic and hard to comprehend but if one hangs on it is worth the read.  There are many terms in the book that I did not know what they were referring to.  The story takes place in Wales and they use many terms that I havent a clue what they mean.  As I now take my daily walks I wonder what it would be like both physically and mentally to go as far as he did. I can also see how the general public could really become enthralled with his journey and want to follow him as a source of comfort and guidance in the lost and questionable world we all live in at times.  It was an easy read.
B0059XTU22|4.0|This is a review from a non-fan of the whole Lord of the Rings universe. I really enjoyed my time at the movies watching the Hobbit. It wasn't the story or the characters that really drew me into this fantasy epic, it was the technology behind the filming process. I'm sure most people reading this are in the know to some degree about the HFR ( high-frame rate ) 48 frames per second vs the standard cinematic 24 frames per second debate. I must say that the 48 fps really made the film for me.<br /><br />This is more of a technical review. I'm a filmmaker myself and have worked with the standard 24fps for the cinema look, 30fps for the video look, and a wide variety of frame rates ranging from 12-60fps for fast or slow motion effects. But this movie is quite apart from that. To see a huge budget film like the Hobbit on the big screen in 3D projected at 48fps, the way it was filmed, wow! A stunning experiences at the movies, one of a kind. Perhaps the most spectacular visuals on screen since Avatar three years ago.<br /><br />Since this is a new process for a mainstream Hollywood narrative film, lots of people are going to compare it to things they already know. Such as videogames, high definition sports broadcasts, documentaries, soap operas, auto motion plus on your HDTV, what have you -- the Hobbit doesn't look like any of those experiences, it's something unique. What does doubling the frame rate do? Twice as much clarity in the picture, much more immersion in the environment, a lifelike quality to everything. Perhaps I can say that it felt almost like live theater in an alternate reality at times but with all the camera angles, shots, movement and effects that theater cannot provide.<br /><br />Think of it this way... standard cinematic 24fps is beautiful, it's dreamy, like a window into another world, 24fps has the quality of a memory. 48fps instead has the quality of a \\"you are there feeling\\", as if you are in the environment with the characters interacting withthe world. The 3D adds immensely to feeling immersed in this new environment. In fact this is the clearest, most natural 3D I've seen, the best since Avatar. Lots of richness, great depth of field and it's precisely because of the 48fps. Let's also mention the C.G.I. ( computer generated imagery ) -- the high frame rate is a blessing for C.G.I. How many recent movies have we seen where the computer effects look fake and annoying even though the films cost hundreds of millions of dollars? The most advanced effects are hampered by 24fps, here in the Hobbit at 48fps, the computer effects blend so well with the real actors and locations that you truly can stop worrying about them and accept the effects as if they were real life.<br /><br />True... the physics of the C.G.I. can get a bit clunky at times. Those giant wolf dog monsters that are running around all the time, the physics aren't perfect. But I didn't expect the perfect physics displayed in Avatar -- The Hobbit still compensates with the pale Orc leader and the King of the Orcs in his mountain hideout. Those visuals are just ridiculous! Amazingly lifelike and convincing. And what about the scene with the three trolls who capture the dwarfs and Bilbo Baggins? Astounding special effects when viewed in 3D at 48fps.<br /><br />Okay, enough about the HFR 3D -- the movie was filmed this way, it deserves to be seen this way, this is the intention of the director. This process of filming is not some cheesy gimmick, it's the real thing... a new magical experience at the cinema.<br /><br />Some words about the film beyond the technical stuff. Um, well... the movie takes a while to get going, to find it's pace. The scene with the dwarfs with Bilbo and Gandalf in Bilbo's house goes on too long. Finally, once the adventure begins, the pacing picks ups and the movie blossoms. Peter Jackson's direction of actors is always high class. Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is the standout performance. Andy Serkis returns as Gollum and for once I actually liked his antics ( thank you 48fps 3D! ). The action sequences are top-notch. The troll scene... the mountain dudes fighting in the rain at night... the big battle with the orcs near the end... all fantastic.<br /><br />The tone of the film is more comical, lighter of heart than the gray, doom and gloom that plagued much of the \\"Lord of the Rings trilogy\\". This quality was a plus to me, I could never fully connect with Lord of the Rings for whatever reason. Maybe it was Frodo that irked me, I like the young Bilbo Baggins much more. Since the tone is lighter, the stakes are not death and end of world matters. It's about a group of oddballs who are journeying to defeat a dragon and the crazy adventures they get into along the way. It's almost a party movie. There is a lot of humor. Not to say the film has no gravitas, this is Peter Jackson's vision and he can turn the tone and go intense and savage when it needs to be. The dark elements are usually centered around that evil pale Orc.<br /><br />The ending of the film is a \\"to be continued\\" scenario, no resolution -- as to be expected. There are two more Hobbit films coming up. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the movies with this one and I'll be back for more! Bring it, Peter Jackson, bring that HFR 3D! It's unique, it's thrilling and amazing! In fact, it's DA BOMB!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was an unexpected surprise. I read the previous reviews and they were right on the money! I could get long winded and technical, but this needs to be made into a movie. I want Tom Hardy as Mark....period. Will someone from Hollywood please get in touch with me for further casting info....thanks!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Would of liked to see some of the characters from previous books but still it was a good read.<br />Looking forward to the next book.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston & Child continue to knock it out of the park, I've yet to read a clinker by them, always fresh always exciting.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Good followup in the series.<br />Strong characters with unusual plot twists.<br />Hope to see some of my favorite characters come back in future books.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Its hard to find awesome flicks and this one def was action packed!  loved it- every minute and would highly recommend:)
B005LAII08|5.0|Great movie and again a wonderful Short from Pixar. Great for all the family. Lots of extras on DVDs and Digital Copy great to have for kids to watch on long car journeys.<br />Perhaps a few scenes might scare very young kids but overall it is a fabulous movie.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This is a great buy for all those fans who just cannot get enough of The Big Bang Theory !!
B002LFAHBO|5.0|One of the best Christmas movies. Blu Ray has lots of extras and is easy to navigate. A must for every home. Just perhaps not for the young kids to watch just now.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The Big Bang Theory just gets better and better with every season. The 5th season is no exception. A must for all fans.
B006362ZR6|5.0|Appreciate all their music! Easy Listen and stacks up to previous albums!<br />Hooked when their music was featured on ER.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This is a great buy for all those who just cannot get enough of The Big Bang Theory !! Every season gets better and better...
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|An insult to Resident Evil Fans everywhere.  By far the worst of the series.  It makes me not even want to see another one if this is the best they can do anymore.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was totally captivated  by the first persona experience while reading .  It is a fascinating  perspective of thought processes and feelings through the eyes of autism. Have highly recommended this book to many.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I wasn't a big fan of this novel.  This book came highly recommended to me by a close friend, but I was wholly unimpressed.  First, the subject matter of the novel was too dark and depressing for me to be able to enjoy reading it.  Second, the majority of the book is written in the first-person narrative style, which I dislike.
B0037HOWKW|5.0|Great little project. All pieces were included along with some extra pieces. It came quickly - faster then anticipated. Love it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a very well written book that gives you an insight to the real Steve Jobs.<br /><br />I learned a great deal about Apple, their internal operating philosophy and the trials and tribulations of the Apple product line.<br /><br />Steve, you will be sorely missed by all.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|I am a Paul Simon fan and have been for years.  In this concert there is an advanced backup and energy about the performance.  I would highly recommend this cd as well as the dvd.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the next book in the series.  It picks up where the last exciting and suspenseful one left off.
B000ATQYT2|3.0|Muppet lovers will, no doubt, adore it.  But fans of Dickens brilliant original dialogue and characters are apt to be disappointed.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I say this in the theatre and was so impressed with the effects, that I wanted a copy for my library.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I loved it because the regular kindle camera was upside down and it was so confusing  to find something that would turn it to normal so I downloaded this app and I loved it doesn't have the editing kind like instagram but it's great for taking pictures the right way!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|SPOILER ALERT. The end was sad and far from perfect but I couldn't<br />  ask for more. If you're team Gale, Don't read, just make up your own ending. Sorry for the spoiler.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I'm not one to give good reviews and I've only been using evernote a few days now but so far it has been very useful to me. It's only been used for things I've decided to look into more rather than just pinning to my pinterest site. It's so easy just to reference something in my notes to remind me to research. I can also use it on my new kindle fire hd, my HTC phone, and my laptop. I've been having a hard time finding apps I can use to consolidate my info on my kindle.
B0000931LJ|5.0|I have been listening to this album for many years and I still never tire of it. T.Rex is the best.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|We love English Comedy and John Cleese is hilarious in this role. I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to find the entire collection on Amazon.  My hubby was delighted to receive as a present!
B0041X90D0|5.0|T.rex is the best of the best of the best. I can play this album over and over and it never gets old.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Could it get any mushier?  Mayhap I am too old for teen romance or just too cynical.  Do teenagers really get that deep these days? Sped through the last half only to see how it ended. Not surprised it was a fairy tale.  Wished they would have been older characters, would have been more believable and would of stopped rolling my eyes.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Gave in after all the reviews...half way through the first book I thought, \\"I am not going to waste money on the second.\\" Then toward the end I was hooked and had to have the second and also bought the third. They were not horrible, kinda good reads but the plot was lacking. Almost \\"too good to be true\\" theme kept coming to mind. I especially didn't like how big events, interesting events were just skipped right over. Sorry to use this analogy but it was kinda like an above average porn...lots of sex and lacking a good plot... There are things I loved about the book...the characters..but for me it was disappointing.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|This book was great.when you start reading it you will not want to put it down.It was a 5 star book
B000092Q4U|5.0|If you have never heard this album, buy it. If you have heard the album and considering buying it, buy it. If you have never heard of lamb of god before and maybe thinking of getting their record, this record kills dude. It's my favorite by them. Every song on this CD is bad ass. Buy it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't stop reading it. This is better than the movie. This type of reading is for men,women, girls and boys. In short for everybody.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I pretty much love everything that Stephen King writes, with the exception of the Dark Towers series. This is no different. The writing style is excellent and the story really good. I always wonder what kind of mind thinks of these things, lol. Love the book. Read it.
B006O3MU96|5.0|If you like the original Doodle Jump, give this one a try. The holiday theme is a nice addition. Fun casual game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|yeah yeah my title is stupid... but I couldn't find a better way to describe this game!! in one word it could be.. addicting. in another it could be... fun.. but that's not enough!! I would say that this game is fun, epic, fantastic, silly,awesome, ....gosh.. these words aren't even GOOD enough!!! :D funny. thing is that I just started playing this yesterday and already best two of my friends scores! (&gt;*_*)&gt; [ ]  ][_, [{}] ][_,
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Another video product that arrived here in Alaska with no damage, and was quick to arrive after placing order. Thanks for being a company to trust!
B009VB97EY|3.0|Movie did not live up to all the media hype about it. Yes, the stripper scenes were good but the story line was lacking and it was ended poorly.
B001E75QH0|5.0|I was very glad to get this set on DVD, and replace worn out VHS Tapes. Quality is great, and as always it arrived up here in the Arctic with no damage or delays.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|John Mayer is extremely talented and you won't be disappointed with this DVD. I love putting it on while I'm working on a project.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Poof!  On the second day after installing, all messages in my inbox disappeared! Other than that, it appeared to be a satisfactory app.  Could not insert hyperlinks with my emails.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|Interesting background about Marilyn Manson - from bis early beginning. Read it with an open mind and remind yourself that it's entertainment
B002GSXKN8|5.0|for the ultimate batman fan. has first four movies. batman returns is my fave of these first four. micheal keaton is the best batman
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Too much Shia and not enough Tom in this movie. Love Tom Hardy. What an actor! Would like to have seen more scenes and development of his romantic relationship in this.
B000001FY9|5.0|love this cd, good song choices, keep it in my mixer in my car always, reminds me of my jamaican honeymoom
B008YJFDQK|5.0|Long-time fan and this album is such a great compilation of so many of his amazing songs.  Another album that speaks to and lifts my soul.
B003QTWR08|5.0|My daughter wanted to see it - I purchased on Amazon Video for 2 days. The quality was great - I have comcast so the quality was in HD. No lag. Very happy of the process.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|Great problem solver!  It would be better is it were a little longer.  But I wish Apple had kept at least one FW port!
B001BWDG0W|5.0|I work as a 'guest teacher'. Last week, I worked an assignment for 2 days (8 classes) teaching Chorus. Each class had a choice of 3 movies to pick from to watch. They all choose Mamma Mia! I didn't really pay much attention to the first 5 showing but after the 6th, I found myself actually watching the movie. By the 8th viewing, like my students,  I was really getting into the songs and plot. During the weekend, I couldn't get the songs out of my head so I decided to purchase the Sound track from Amazon. All 18 songs downloaded onto my Kindle Fire, which is great, except I can't get the songs to transfer over the my Windows Media Play (Music) nor have I had any success in trying to figure out how to transfer the songs onto my MP3 players. I've purchased several MP3 format songs (singles) off of Amazon and have never encountered a problem. I guess it's different if you purchase an entire album. The entire album automatically downloaded, using Cloud, onto my Kindle. Because of this experience, I will NEVER purchase another album using the instant download feature. I will just buy whatever l CD I want, that way I can download songs onto my Music and MP3 player. Once done, I will import the music onto my cloud. Outside of this very annoying glitch, I am very happy with my purchase.
B003EVWDR0|4.0|I think some of this story is rehashed from the earlier movies I mentioned of a human being inserted into a virtual existence and the soldier who goes native when he sees he's on the wrong side of the fight. That being said this story moves along very quickly and the graphics are absolutely amazing. I got the HD version and have a 40\\" screen that will support it but the colors are so vivid, the contrast so amazing it is breathtaking even for the sophisticated viewer. Definitely worth the price I paid to make it a keeper.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|So I am both, at least I was until I bought this collection, but it is worth it if you have the money and a big fan, otherwise forget the whole thing.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|For me, it lacks ease of use. I am new to Kindle and this is one app that I plan to delete.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|My family loved this movie!  So much that we kept having 'showings' with all their friends.  Several boys decided it was just too good to only rent - they went out and bought it.
B005VPRGB0|5.0|My grandson has several of the Technic vehicles and loves to build them.  When finished the movement and detail is impressive.
B000007MVD|5.0|I love all things Beatles but it was very special to hear these early live performances and get to know their younger selves. There is something both touching and compelling in hearing a less inhibited George or self-conscious John singing. Paul is almost unrecognizable in some numbers. Well worth the price to get this &#34;new&#34; perspective.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This one is so much easy to play then some of the others I've tried.  However, the advertisments that need to be deleted with each new game are annoying.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|We love this series! I have five complete seasons plus the current one on the &#34;season ticket&#34; plan, buying each episode as its released. It's great having something so consistently enjoyable when there's nothing worthwhile on cable.  The cast, character development and story lines continue to rock the geek!
B007TXN4TK|3.0|It is fun to follow the finger moves but on such a small screen placing the fingers on the keys is a bit difficult.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this comment is for the app maker. I love the app, it is better than the other youtube app, but as a request can you alter the app so you can veiw the videos horozontily and vertically and so the charging port can be on either side and you don't have to veiw the video up side down
B000HIVIOW|2.0|I was dissappointed that this dvd was not narrated by David Bowie. He did a introduction in the beginning of this movie but a different voice narrated the movie. The original vhs movie was narrated by him throughout the whole movie.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I rented this movie based on the trailer (looked promising) but was quite disappointed after watching it in its entirety. The plot seemed like a mix of older sci-fi films (Aliens, Event Horizon, etc) and the ending left me hanging.
0545265355|5.0|When my girlfriend introduced to me to this series around a year ago, it was just about when the film started receiving hype. I honestly had no will in reading this series as I thought it would be another \\"twilight.\\"<br />But she went on and on about it so I figured I would just read it so I could know why she was talking about even if it happened to be a terrible series. Boy was I wrong.<br />Once I picked up the first book, I could not put it down. My eyes were glued to the pages in which I kept turning and turning in hunger for more. I spent one night reading the first book and quickly got the second one.<br />This is what I've discovered about the trilogy: The Hunger Games series is NOT about kids killing eachother, at least not directly. This is a story of a girl who defies an almighty, power-hungry Capitol. It's a story about standing up for what you believe in, and \\"not being a piece in their game.\\" So every time someone asks me, \\"Why do you like it? It's so depressing it's about kids killing eachother?\\" I want to clear up that it is about Katniss' LACK of killing the other kids which is what makes the book series.<br /> That question also brings me to another point: the series being depressing. I loved this series because it was raw and truly real. Even though they were in some sort of futuristic nation, I felt as if it was really happening because of how emotional it all is. This is how I like books to be. I don't like a perfect sugar-coated ending because that is not how life is. People were expecting the final book, Mockingjay, to end with every character still alive, and for them all to just be one happy family together. No. That's not how life works. You see Katniss go into depression, you see her losing her sanity, but most importantly: you see her heal. That is the final moral of the series: things can always get better, there is always hope, and no matter how dark your situation, is it will always be okay in the end.<br />Coming from an almost 36 year old man who had no desire whatsoever in reading this series at first, I whole-heartingly recommend this series for ages 13+ (as it deals with some mature topics) and for any on the brink of deciding whether or not to read it just go for it. I had no good expectations before and now I love a young adult series. I highly recommend for those who are craving a new book series to conjure up or for those who just want to be entertained in spare time.<br />Bottom line: Excellent characters, excellent writing, and an excellent series.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This an outright fun and extremely enjoyable action movie. It is a movie for action fans and not meant to be taken too seriously.
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|This is the cast that I listened to all throughout high school, and it's going to be hard to convince me that there's a better cast than the Dream Cast from the 10th Anniversary Concert.  It's a must have!
B009NQKXYK|2.0|Very visually interesting, but plot story week. Characters cliche and undeveloped. I was more happy the movie was over than upset with lack of answers. Ending; sequel setup and tie end with Alien.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like using this on my new kindle fire.  I use it more on my kindle than on my desktop or phone. Haven't tried to take any pictures and upload from it yet, so I will reserve that last star
B005LAIIPS|4.0|We did not find this movie as exciting as the previous Bourne movies.<br /><br />It looks like it may be time for retirement.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|But it wasn't! I was pleasantly surprised - this was completely different and kept me extremely engaged. There were surprises I didn't expect coming and the writing was great.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|game was fun and not to complicated.  I will look for more similar games. the game was just not long enough.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sweet/deep love story with an unexpected twist, love it! Took me just a few days to read because I couldn't put it down!
1421550644|5.0|This box set is beautiful. I really have to give Viz credit for not only bringing back an older property, but also producing it in such a great, well crafted manner. The set itself is bound well with non-glossy, medium weight paper. Beautiful sepia tone ink with a great poster and a fair amount of additional illustrations.<br /><br />Seriously, if you like manga, comics, science fiction, fantasy, beautiful art, epic stories. This is for you.<br /><br />Buy it now!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The picture and sound quality is great and watching the films in hi def all over again was awesome - especially the second one.<br /><br />I love this box set packaging.  It really is different and just makes you want to sit there are read through the 'pages'.  The art work is great.  The only thing I would say is that you need to be a little careful when 'lifting' the discs out from the sleeve as I think it could be easy to tear the card.  I wish they had put a bit more thought into this but otherwise this is brilliant.
B00009ZYC1|4.0|I got this to complete the Shrek movies.  I loved these movies growing up and still enjoy watching it over and over.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The focus is learning more about the details of the two primary characters rather than focus on their sexual relationship.  As a result, a much more interesting read.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I struggle to navigate mobile Pinterest, especially looking for my boards and items I've pinned. I feel I'm clicking back to home each time to navigate somewhere new instead of being able to jump from search to search and then to my boards.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Light reading.  No surprise to the plot or character development.  Good for a rainy day and better than watching television.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I started out with the original 1st generation fire and liked the feature letting you choose between most recent/popular view on the news feed and the 7&#34; hd unfortunately does not have this option- hopefully it will come with an update. Conversely, the new fire does not require you to login each and every time you go to that app which is a BIG plus.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Altho a bit of a tome, the story keeps you interested from the beginning.  An excellent way to find insight into the lives of people during some very difficult times.  Looking forward to Book #3
B0086700CM|4.0|We put this game on my old 1st generation fire for my 13 yr old- she has not had any freezing or force close issues  which for ME is a huge plus!! She plays this game all the time.  Was a free download when we got it.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Wonderful compiltation of songs from the show.  I listen to it all the time and never tire of it.  Looking forward to the next one!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Absolutely wonderful. What a great program; worth ever penny.  Would recommend for total family viewing.  We will pass around to family members for their enjoyment.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game i can go on for hours enjoy in the bed watching TV I am sure I will play this game a lot and will not eat in bed anymore.  Well I hope.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have enjoyed this game and find it hard to put down. A great puzzle that makes you think.  Recommended for all.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it great enjoyment watching TV in the Bed Just got the Kindle for X-Mas I am sure I will enjoy the Games
B001AR0D4A|5.0|It's been a while since I had seen a horror movie I really liked. I had really liked the short story by Stephen King and was stoked when I learned that it was being made into a movie by the same director that had successfully adapted two other King stories, &#34;Shawshank Redemption&#34; and &#34;The Green Mile&#34;.  I was not disapointed when I had seen the theatrical release of &#34;the Mist&#34;. Little did I know that I was in for another treat when I bought the Blu-ray that also contained the directors cut in black and white. Watching the movie in black and white changed the whole feel of the film. There was a whole new layer of atmosphere watching it like that. Who would have that by merely going from color to black and white would intensify the movie like that. It reminded me of watching &#34;Night of the Living Dead&#34; for the first time. now only the directors version of &#34;the Mist&#34; exists for me. Give it a shot if you haven't seen it. It turned a movie I all ready enjoyed into a favorite.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I rate it excellent because it was free. It is stupid to rate EVERYTHING you get. Sometimes you get things just because you need them.
B000088NSY|5.0|Well i have owned Synchonicity a few times in my life.......RBCD......vinyl.......even remastered RBCD version from a few years ago, but this SACD mix sounds cleaner and has a deeper warmer feeling than all the previous versions. One of the immediate things is that I hear a another layer of percussion on some songs..... like &#34;walking in your footsteps&#34; and &#34;tea in the Sahara&#34; that i never heard before or the sax punches on &#34;O My God&#34; that make this song feel like i really never heard it before.<br /><br />Synchronicity II is still one of finest rock songs of the Police (and arguably of the 80's!) and sounds excellent on this disc with nice deep mid range sounds.<br /><br />The overall mix is well balanced and everything seems to be in the right proportions with drums, bass, guitar, synths and vocals all being well and evenly balanced.<br /><br />If you are a fan of this album then u owe it to yourself to find a copy of this SACD!
0765325950|5.0|Well i finally finished the book, and wow what can i say, ill try to give an in depth spoiler free review<br /><br />Firstly, ebook people i want to say yes its annoying,  and id have preferred it on kindle<br /><br />But by not buying this book you are cheating yourselves of a treat. Also your harming an author who has produced a masterpiece with your one star ratings.<br /><br />Anyway finishing this book has produced a whole slew of emotions for me, having followed the series for so many years. Sadness that it is over, but pleasure at a fitting finale<br /><br />The book itself is heavier on action than the previous books, with a lot of battle scenes, which some may not like i guess. But it still has moments of triumph, moments of tragedy, and i found myself upset at some points, and silently mouthing 'yes!' at others.<br /><br />The first 20% of the book is scene setting- i actually was dissapointed at this point...but then it takes off, without giving you time to take a breath.<br /><br />One other difference with this book-main characters tend to be very safe in wheel of time, this is not the case in this book! although you will have to read and find out who lives and dies.<br /><br />Many questions where answered, the ending was satisfying (apart from i didnt want it to end!) and i can wholeheartedly recommend the book.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Item arrived on time  It was as discribed  It was a present that was a well receied one many thx
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I would definitely recommend this movie for a viewing. The humor reminded me of \\"Bridesmaids\\", which is a good thing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is addictive!  Don't plan on playing it just a few minutes because once you start you are hooked!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not quite as exciting as book one, but still kept you on the edge of your seat.  I had some trouble keeping all the tributes straight.  Other than that, I enjoyed it a lot and look forward to book three.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I read this as part of the Sword & Laser's January book club selection. thought this was a great book and would definitely recommend it. I felt it was very well balanced. It never got heavy handed on the science, or the humor. The great thing about this book is you don't really have to be a fan of Science fiction to enjoy it. It's got something for everyone; humor, character depth, action, etc. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Thought I was pretty good at chess but the AI beat me consistently. Great free app if you like chess.
B008AT71WI|5.0|Little Shop of Horrors began as a challenge to pop film maker Roger Corman to produce a movie in under a week with a shooting time of just two days. The result was a cult classic. Forward to the 1980s and LSoH was re-imagined as a musical that ran for quite a while off Broadway. A few years later, Frank Oz adapts the musical to a big-budget film starring Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, and an unforgettable performance by Steve Martin.<br /><br />Oz intended to fully adapt the film as the theatrical performance played out with the plant taking over the world. What Oz did not expect was that Moranis and Greene had made their characters so endearing to the audience, After they are killed, the audience went from quite happy to nearly shell-shocked in test market viewings before the film went into general release. This forced Oz to pull the film and quickly shoot an alternate ending where Moranis goes from nerd to hero and saves the day and his love. With that change, and the loss of twenty minutes and ten million dollars worth of film, the film went on to be a success. Now over 20 years later, the film has made it way to Blu-Ray disc and for the first time, the viewer can watch either the theatrical (happy) ending or the original ending where the plant wins.<br /><br />Watching the Director's Cut version, I was very taken at how the film goes from such a happy go-lucky type of film to something very different. Yes, even though it is done with a lot of camp to lighten the mood, it is quite a shock to see Audrey, then Seymour turn to plant food. It's even quite tearful to hear Audrey tell Seymour to feed her dead body to the plant so she can become part of what has made him successful, &#34;a place that's green&#34;.<br /><br />Yes, this is one of the best examples of how the director's original vision to end the film was wrong, despite finally seeing the intentional gleeful B-movie grade effects when the plant takes over. But at least you can both endings now for yourself, along with a great collection of supplements about the making of the film. This is a great addition to any film collection.

B003L20IJW|5.0|As the title proclaims, Nanny McPhee indeed returns to save the day once more. This time out, its a bit less dark as the character seems to be a bit more fleshed out. We learn a tiny bit more about our new favorite nanny and learn she's a lot more well known to a lot of people. The magic is a bit more overt and the script is more playful, despite some pretty serious challenges the family in need has to face. But as one would expect, all is well at the end as Nanny McPhee walks into the sunset.<br /><br />More please!!!!

B008MIMWOO|4.0|Mike Myers certainly found his mojo when he came up with the idea for Austin Powers. A super-hip super spy from the 1960s that volunteers to be cryogenically frozen to face his arch-nemesis Dr. Evil (who as also frozen) some time in the future. Well, the future arrives in the 1990s and we soon see the 1960s &#34;free love&#34; mindset of Powers collide with the ultra-conservative AIDS era with the results being really funny.<br /><br />The following two films finds Powers travelling through time to continue his fight against Dr. Evil, but by the time he confronts Goldmember in the third film, the premise has begun to wear thin. I think it was obvious to all that despite leaving an opening for a fourth installment, it was time to leave well enough alone. After several years, there were rumors of a fourth Powers film, but I think Myers came to his senses.<br /><br />Yet, this is certainly Mike Myers at his best and its a delight to see him making fun of the James Bond franchise with all its predictable contrivances that Myers revels in making parodies out of.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Wow...this story was so deep, so full of heartache, for me....it was just too much.  I'm not even sure that I would classify it as a romance because that was on the back burner the whole story.<br /><br />I did enjoy the story, it was different then what I normally read but would I go back and reread it?  No.  And I would probably not recommend it either because to me, this story is only for certain kinds of readers.  I prefer a lighthearted read with some angst to it.  I don't mind crying and I did cry in this story but my crying wasn't a feel good cry, it was horrible.<br /><br />I read to escape reality and this made me feel like I turned on the evening news and they were broadcasting a story on a rapist/child molester that has gotten away with doing these horrible crimes for the better part of his life.<br /><br />I gave the story three stars because it is really well written and the author deserves props for that.<br /><br />Definitely not a feel good read.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|ZeptoLab have created another masterpiece. Adorable (and flawless) implementation with a thoughtful puzzle underneath. The kind of game I want my children to play.<br /><br />Normally I am not interested in &quot;shift the blocks&quot; puzzles, but this one really drew me in.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Both my sons are Takara Tomy beyblade lovers! They would not buy anything else because they say the material is so heavy and solid that they are great for battles.
B0086700CM|4.0|only played it for a little while but I really like it. I would tell others to buy this. Thank you
B004KKX814|5.0|Both my boys are crazy about beyblades. They would not purchase anything else but Takara Tomy. The material is so solid and heavy that they are great for battles.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I absolutely love this album. It is the only good thing to come out of American idol. I'm new to folk music, but have been listening to it on repeat.
B004KKX80A|5.0|Both my boys are crazy about beyblades and they would not buy anything else but Takara Tomy because of their solid and heavy construction. They are great for battles!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once you start reading this book, you wont be able to stop! Its addicting and very good! I recommend it for older, mature audiences.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game!!  Purchased app for my disabled Mother and she played constantly for days... lol  Also loved the card backs that can change to the players likes.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Snow White is one of the classics that my daughter in law did not have. Being a big Disney fan she was very excited.

B0008ENHT4|5.0|My Dad has forever talked about the chase scene in Bullitt.  Finally, this Christmas we got it for him and he enjoyed it as much as he did watching it the first time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|OMG!!  This is BY FAR the best show on television.  Watched all of season 1 and 2 in a few days.  Had to buy season 3 to catch up!  A MUST SEE!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Watch this....it is completely unbelievable. Each episode is clearly better than the last...gripping plot, convincing characters, and an awesome take on an overuses apocalyptic scenario
B005COO1X6|5.0|Enjoyed this short story. Stephen King is one of my favorite authors.  My favorite novel of his is Duma Key. If you have not read it, you should.
B003XKAZKO|4.0|I received the product in time and I liked, but I thought that was included a box and not only paper
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This Kingkiller Chronicle is great fantasy.  I cannot wait for the third installment to be published.  I think this series will be considered a classic in the future.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Simply amazing. Learn about love, friendship, family, life and yourself. It's a quick easy read, and definitely worth the time to read. Absolutely love it!
0756404746|5.0|I really feel that this series is the next Lord of the Rings.  Fantasy writing at its best.  A great read!
B00280LYIM|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read the whole series is great I recommend it for anyone & everyone!
B009RH9FR6|1.0|The first thing I noticed was an odor that irritated my nose and eyes, hoped that would fade, but it didn't fast enough to suit me. I also disliked the way my Kindle flapped around when using hand strap, had to keep my thumb on it to keep in place. I have the Kindle Fire Genuine Leather Cover by Marware on my original Kindle Fire, and absolutely love it! Wish Marware would make one just like it for Fire HD &#34;7.<br />I returned this and ordered a belkin cover, it will suffice until I can find a cover similar to my Kindle Fire Genuine Leather Cover by Marware.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|3 1/2 stars. Really was not planning on reading the whole series.  The love story is cute but Grey`s issues are jut too heavy for me.
B006ZZC3D6|3.0|I got frustrated with this game as an adult because my 'fat fingers' would send the little fuzzball the wrong way or not exactly where I wanted it to land.  Not very consistent game play, but my nephew loved it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Out of the ordinary ! Sexy! And oh so hot!!<br /><br />I would've never imagined loving this whole series as much as I did! Even my husband would tell me to go read it.... ;-)
B000LN7HUC|5.0|I've been backpacking and camping for most of my life using the white gas beasts with the Boy Scouts. Over the last few years I've been using all manner of homemade alcohol stoves on my own trips into the Cascades in Oregon and the Trinity Alps in California. I'd heard of Trangia years ago, liked the idea, but had never seen one in action and just stuck with my DIY creations. I finally decided to try a real Trangia, I got the Mini Trangia set and just love it!<br /><br />First off, I have to say that this thing is built to last. The stove weighs a little more than my super cat and other homemade stoves, but is clearly going to last a very, very long time. The pot and pan/lid are both made from thicker aluminum than I expected. They feel nice and sturdy, but aren't too heavy. Same goes for the pot stand. Really, great construction throughout.<br /><br />Secondly, this system is very well thought out - this seems to be the case for any kit that Trangia makes. The pieces nest together well in storage, and in use the pot is shaped to sit securely on the pot stand and the lid is shaped similarly to keep it from sliding off the pot. The pot-grabber design works well, and is sturdy enough that I can pick up a pot full of water and pour or sip from it. I like that the stove will store alcohol in it - I've heated two pot-fulls (about 2 quarts) of water for cocoa in the snow, using just what fuel I had stored in the stove. The simmer ring makes it safe and easy to extinguish the flame, or to regulate heat for simmering rice or cooking eggs.<br /><br />Yes, it's slower than white gas or canister stoves but that doesn't bother me, it's a good trade-off for something that is dead quiet and won't break down. Also, I've heard they don't fare so well in extreme temperatures or at extreme altitudes, so if you're planning on using it for this I'd do a little homework to make sure that it'll work where you're going. However, for general backpacking I can't recommend this set enough! It's a well-made set made by people in Sweden who take pride in their products.<br /><br />A few tips for using yours - I got a little strap to keep everything together when it's packed away (just like the full-size Trangia kits), so I don't have to worry about the lid popping off and spilling the contents. Inside I keep a [[ASIN:B004410NYO Light My Fire FireSteel]] (another awesome Swedish product) which is great for lighting the stove, a small sponge for cleaning, and a windscreen (a must for any stove). If you're going to be cooking for two this pot may work, but the set will nest inside my well-used [[ASIN:B000MVTIOQ Grease Pot]], which I've found is sufficient for two people.<br /><br />*** Also, don't fill the stove more than 3/4 full (per instructions). I filled mine to the top and it took forever to get to full flame, and it flared up and bubbled burning alcohol over the side - oops! You'll be fine as long as you don't over-fill it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the book. Can't wait for the movie!  Got to read the final book, now. So much action it really keeps you captivated.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter cant stop playing this game. I have to forcibly take the Kindle out of her hands. And I am amzed at how awesome she played it right away. I'm still struggling with it. LOL
B004IPPINW|4.0|A thoughtful, challenging book about the effects that racism and religious ignorance can have on an otherwise indifferent individual. Narrated in the first person, the book seems to progress at the speed of sound from pre 9/11 to post 9/11; from Pakistan to the United States back to Pakistan, all the time encountering incidents, persons and ideas that impact on the narrator in a manner that will determine his decision at the end of the book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game!  Great on the kindle fire.  Kind of spooky- couldn't put it down!  Look forward to kore games from this developer.
1781166838|5.0|I don't want to re-hash what many others have written here, but this book is amazing.  I'm a professional bookbinder (fineblankbooks.com) and I make entirely handmade books custom-made to my customers specifications, so it's kinda hard to impress me with a mass-produced book.  This one completely impressed me; both as a beautiful book/object and as someone with a probably slightly over-the-top love for this show.  I've watched this show since episode 1 and feel I pretty much know it inside and out and this book has so much great info. in it!  It's NOT just a book full of beautiful photos of Jared & Jensen (though it has plenty of those too).  My favorite parts are the sections that deal with the behind-the scenes stuff and I especially can't wait to read the section about what goes into the creation of the hotel room sets (I've always been a bit fascinated with how they came up with the distinctive look to the hotel rooms which is definitely unique to this show).<br /><br />You've already read (in the other reviews here) about all the stuff that comes with the book that you can pull out.  That's all very cool (though when I received the book, the envelope of posters of the Chuck Shurley book covers had already pulled off the page in transit and taken some of the image with it...luckily, I can do book repair!  But it's bad for a book - bad for the binding - to have something that thick shoved into it and I'll probably re-attach the envelope to the page, but leave the folded posters out of it when it's stored; just keep them near it instead of in it).<br /><br />From a bookbinder's perspective, this book is actually SEWN together (in folded sections called \\"signatures\\") which is a rarity anymore (often, even large coffee-table books that are mass-produced are glued together instead of sewn).  This allows the book to lay open flat and is really the best way to make a book.  There's nothing I hate more than paying a lot for a book only to get it and find out it was cheaply assembled.  This one was not.  (And it helped that Amazon's price on this book was $37 when I ordered it instead of the $50 sticker price; though it's worth $50, in my opinion!).  There is a lot of attention to detail in the look and content of this book.<br /><br />I mentioned that it was bad for the binding to have stuff attached to the pages (it adds thickness to the book that puts stress on the spine over time), HOWEVER, with the exception of the thick packet of Chuck Shurley posters, the other things that are attached to the pages are spread around; attached in different places on different pages (they aren't all attached to the center of the pages, for example) and if you're going to attach things to the pages, this is the RIGHT way to do it!  It means that no one area of the book ends up with excess thickness...this is the kind of attention to details I'm talking about...someone who designed it knew what they were doing!<br /><br />The only negative comment as far as the binding of this book goes is that it seems that the publisher left out the step of adding backing cloth which reinforces the area where the cover \\"hinges\\" open.  Publishers often skip this step to save money, but it means that the only thing holding the book into the cover are the endpapers glued to the inside of the front & back covers.  It's slightly disappointing to see that they skipped this step with they put so much thought into everything else, but it's more important that the book is sewn together than that they skipped the backing cloth, in my opinion.<br /><br />I recommend, if you are a fan of Supernatural, that you should purchase this book immediately while it's still widely available.  It's so much more than a book full of glossy photos.  Awesome (as Dean would say)!ply assembled.  This one was not.

B00AIQP9DE|2.0|I am stuck on chapter five. it will not allow me to attach the rope to the block under the car. hints keep telling me to connect. major bugs. don't buy unless they fix the bugs.
B00ARAO720|4.0|There is no mistaking by the title that this will be an action packed movie, but beyond that, it is an enjoyable one as well.  I think this is entirely due to Joseph Gordon Levitt's performance.  I've always liked him and think he is finally coming into his own as an actor and is truly able to carry a movie as an engaging lead.  Great popcorn, Saturday night movie.  I really recommend.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game. It is also teaching me how to manage money. I'm 10 years old and this is cool. I'm glad my mom let me download it.
0525952926|5.0|Winter of the World builds so perfectly on the base of Fall of Giants.  Each character develops gradually so that you feel you can see them grow and mature.  And the adherence to historic facts adds a dimension that makes both these books impossible to put down.  Any time Mr. Follett publishes a new book, I know I'll be losing sleep.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I got this app for the time in between when I broke my old Kindle and the new one had yet to arrive. It works great. The only downside is it has a tendency to freeze up when I use the search function occasionally, and the smaller screen means I read several pages a minute. Do yourself a favor and set up the options so that your phones volume buttons become the page forward and page backward commands. That makes reading more pleasant. Overall, I use this app every day at work during my lunch and I am really happy with it.
0547884591|2.0|I used to be a big Fan of the Tim-approach. However, this book clearly shows how he tries to cuts ways short in whatever he does. It is produced according to deadlines and doesn't deliver the value his older books delivered. If you read the others and have some cooking experience, don't even think about wasting your money. Tim, don't try to write the 4-hour Brain within the next 12 months!
B000002OAZ|5.0|This is a classic historic album and i was surprised to find it still available.  You have a good selection
B002RXMG00|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in quite some time and thought I would watch it again.  What a great movie !  Not to give it away for folks who have not seen it but the shower seen, though classic and original for its time, is not the scariest scene in the movie.  Anthony Perkins was a great choice to play Norman Bates.  A must see movie if you haven't had a chance.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|It is useful but unnecessary in my case since I already had this app.  That being said, everyone should have this app.
B005F6NA5G|5.0|Whether he is just playing his guitar with his fabulous touch or singing along with his beautiful voice, the CD is simply sublime.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I already had the app in my tablet and hadn't noticed since I don't go on Facebook that often.  It's free so I am not complaining.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|My son told me about this web series. I watched it and can't wait for the next movie. And I'm not a big Halo fan.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I keep thinking I'm going to run across a King novel that I don't care for one of these days, but I can't even seem to find one I don't love. This was no exception. There is something about his writing that just makes it so hard to put down!
B00A9D0K2G|5.0|I saw this on the Disney Channel and I had to get it on DVD.  I love the message it sends and I love the songs.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Have you seen the Expendables? Same thing! Lots of stuff getting blown up and people being shot at. You would think they would have a better aim by now.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Interesting, but not earth-shaking.  Bought to read while traveling, and it was entertaining, but not as much as I thought it might be.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have no idea why Amazon asks me to rate something and then requires me to write something too. Stars should be enough!
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|some of the content was inappropriate for kids, and completely unnecessary to the film. that being said it was an ok film...
B009IEXKXI|5.0|brilliant... that pretty much sums this book up, its easy to identify with the main character the plot is engaging and unpredictable the jokes are hilarious i found myself having to stop several times just to stop giggling. all in all a must have book.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I loved reading this book from Charlie's point of view. It was amazing to read about the everyday lives of the fictional characters in this story. I wish there was a sequel!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The series is amazing and I am looking forward to digging into more of Suzanne Collins' books...My daughter says she is a great writer and so far i have to agree.
B003YL4L0W|2.0|I am a pretty big Jodi Picoult fan but this book is a real snoozer. It was  all pretty predictable.. no big shockers.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|since I don't get HBO it is awesome to have this collection...Just love the story line and can not wait for the next season to come out on DVD..thanks
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is so much fun to play. My grandchildren (ages 2 and 4) love it as well. Every time I see them, they ask if i brought &#34;the game&#34;.
B007THA4FI|3.0|it is an okay read...am struggling with it...put it down for a bit and will pick it back up...not sure what I expected but not holding my interest.
B004J64QR4|5.0|This the all time best !!!  I saw the show in London and in New York, and these voices, coupled with the Video, is amazing !!!!!<br />Alfie Boe is my favorite!!!  What a performance.  Brings tears every time I watch. Too bad this is not available on CD; only the 25th anniv. cast recording is available (not Alfie Boe).  Don't miss this one!!!
B00479SVBU|5.0|This thing is great. I use it in my car of course. My car radio does play Mp3's but who want to burn all those mp3 cd's. I have owned something like this before, it was alot cheaper and the signal out was very weak. That was because it ran on 1 AA battery. But this thing since it is plugged into the cig lighter it has much more power and even out powers the station on which there is a broadcast... that is great. alway clear. The things i dont like about it is if you forget to place a bookmark and turn your car off you lost where you were at. It just goes back to beginning of the chapter. ( I listen to audio books while driving most of the time.) Now thats on sdcard part of it. I dont remember if it does it on the usb. I also rarely use the passthru part of if it. That is using your ipod or mp3 player.. 5 star in my book... Enjoy!!!! I bought this in July 2012. Opps almost forgot... the remote is a piece of junk. It melted or warped in the summer sun or heat in the car.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Works great - nice layout, efficient, can;t ask for any better. Does ES have any other apps? I'd use them in a second!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was a wonderful season.  There were a lot of twists and turns to the plot-line, and it was great finally to get through the war years.  I look forward to season 3.
0439023491|3.0|Not finished reading this book yet. So far it is slow. Not much action, mostly about the tour of the districts that the kids make when they return.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|not enough hours in the day to enjoy this novel. A great read once started you cannot put it down
B0000024PC|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out in 1967 in Montreal. All I can say is that it brings back wonderful memories from when I was courting my wife-to-be. We loved the Simon & Garfunkel score, & are considering buying the DVD from Amazon if it is available.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy is seriously an epic!! Batman becomes a symbol not only in the movie but also in my life because of Christopher!!
B000002AGM|5.0|This is all about Miles, right? Wrong! Oh, I'm not saying that Miles didn't play a mean trumpet, & these were the days (1957)before Miles used his muted sound that was to really make him famous in the jazz world.<br /><br />You get to hear Miles in an orchestral setting, very unlike the recordings he very shortly began with the famous quintet recordings like \\"Relaxin\\" & \\"Workin',\\" etc. with the likes of Trane. Bill Evans, Red Garland, & others, oh yeah, Red Garland & Paul Chambers.<br /><br />But this recording would never have happened without one of the greatest arrangers ever, Gil Evans. He was to Miles as Fletcher Henderson was to Benny Goodman.<br /><br />I'm not going to talk about the tunes at all, because other reviewers have done that. I DO hope you'll give this album a try, & thanks for reading my review.
B009CGARZG|4.0|I like it, this is a very good movie and great quality. The hd is worth is it. Great Picture too.
0553801473|5.0|Amazon wanted to know if this book &#34;met my expectations&#34;, well I guess the answer is a resounding YES.<br /><br />YES, many questions were answered.<br />YES, there are now more questions than ever before.<br />YES, I loved the ending.<br />YES, THERE ARE DRAGONS.<br /><br />That's really all you need to know about this book. Read the other ones first, though.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Good book, a different and good way to see life, try to live the four agreements every day. Be happy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|ads are a small banner across the top so they are not distracting. calculator is clear and simple to use.  nice feature is that it shows the recent entries and functions you've entered so you can keep track of where you are in a longer chain of transactions, for example if summing up a long list of numbers.  functions reliably. it is full screen on kindle fire (1st gen) so keys are easy to see and type.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I choose this rating because it took my emotions and threw them everywhere. It was like a crazy roller coaster ride in my heart i just love and can't wait to read the next book.
B000JQU4TW|3.0|If I had read this book decades ago, I would rate it higher. Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however. I suspect the general public could invest their time better with another book.
B0058VW36U|3.0|this game is ok but it has adds in it even though you pay for it. And it makes you pay for this thing where the monster can have mind powers to move the candy so he can eat it.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Better made than expected. Very happy with screen protector included with case, as well as case's sleek fit to phone to allow iPhone to be minimally obscured (yet protected).
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game to play while watching tv or waiting in the doctor's office.<br />It's challenging and makes you think of stragetic moves. Good brain game.
B009MF56GC|3.0|Not as good as Expendable, but along the same line of mayhem.  Kind of hard to watch, but it has it moments.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|These are early versions of songs from All Things Must Pass & other albums.  They are spare and minimalist -  no Phil Spector here.  It makes me wonder if the market would have been ready for a non-Spector All Things Must Pass in 1970.  The disc is only 30 minutes but it's a sure thing for any Beatles fan.
B004A8ZX2I|4.0|Just looking at the cover you would not guest that this was a good movie, good plot and very entertaining.  I really enjoyed it.  Liam Neeson is really good in this movie as is the entire cast.  It keep you guesting but entertained.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I purchased \\"Hopeless\\", but once I got started I could not put it down. I read it in four days! What a wonderful twist of romance and suspense.  The characters and experiences were so real. I absolutely recommend reading this book.
B009C5Z112|5.0|&#34;I wasn't prepared for this, but I'm not ready to dieeeee...&#34;<br /><br />I wanted to give the LP 150 stars, but there were only 5!<br /><br />It - is - the last Oreo cookie.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is great. Not many flaws in the game. Fun for all ages. Nice way to pass the time.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|I am not criticizing the earlier X-Men films at all.  I like &#34;X-Men&#34; and I love &#34;X2&#34; trust me.  But &#34;First Class&#34; really nails down the feeling of the comics, and yet is an excellent film on its own.<br /><br />The cast is perfect, with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender at the center, and a wonderful supporting cast including everyone from Jennifer Lawrence to Rose Byrne to Kevin Bacon to January Jones to Oliver Platt, and beyond.  There's a simple idea in film: You can fail with a great cast; but you will always fail with a terrible cast.  These people, every one of them, did an excellent job.<br /><br />The film starts with a reminder of the first &#34;X-Men&#34; film.  And it progresses through the 60s, and the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the relationship between Professor X and Magneto (even giving us an idea as to how they got those names).  The time period is captured in perfect comic book fashion and I loved it.<br /><br />The video is amazing.  It looks just wonderful.<br /><br />The extras are fun, and you get a real idea of how much goes into making a film of this scale.<br /><br />Absolutely recommended!
B00094OBS4|1.0|The sad part is the disc came from the UK and it wouldn't play on my Blu-Ray. The Blu-Ray disc that will work costs $167.00. If you can get a disc that works for a reasonable price, you will love the music from the real rock and rollers. I had taped it from cable and lost it when my dvd died.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I got a new Kindle for Christmas, but didn't realize I had to use a FB app...I was trying to go straight to the website and had disastrous results.  Pages kept skipping etc.... wrote to Kindle, they told me about the app, and voila!  All my problems solved.  I have had NO problems.

B00A23MYCC|4.0|This movie is full of teenage memories which made it very humorous for me. I haven't enjoyed a comedy like this in a very long time.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I watch this movie a lot. I am a film major and not only is good from a production standpoint but from a personal standpoint.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this second book in the series. The characters have developed and grown. The \\"plots have thickened\\" and their are twists and turns in every chapter.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This series was great. One does need to read the first two books in the series before reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  Lisbeth, the person the book is centered around, is a powerful and unique character. If you read the first two books, you will love this one.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Authentic LifeProof cases are amazing, I own two of them now, however, the one that I recently purchased from Amazon was shipped third party from One Stop Electronics, it is not authentic. I had some issues with it as soon as I got it, the packaging looks exactly the same, and honestly I couldn't tell a difference by looking at the case, the screen however had a significant warp to it and it did not pass the watertight test, it leaked slightly, also the sound from the phone speakers coming through it was horrible. I called LifeProof and they checked the two serial numbers on the back of the case and the front and told me that they did not manufacture either of those #'s. they said that several companies have done a really good job of cloning them and mine was a counterfeit. Good rule of thumb to go by, if it seems to cheap to be true then it probably is. Also, they said before purchasing one to check their authorized retailer list on their website. On a partial good note,  BIG thumbs up to Amazon though for immediately making it right with me.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|So far it works great for me. I have the kindle fire second gen.  Not the hd.  Everything seems to work good.  I will of course update if anything changes. I like it better than the non mobile site and the mobile version on my first gen kindle.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book of the trilogy was much better.  I enjoyed the not so predictable ending and loved the progression of the marriage and subsequent family.
B0076XIS4O|3.0|Everyone can admit, Grimes is the most adorable little pop star since, wait, has anyone been able to make music so cute yet so serious before? I suppose you could cite Barbie Girl by Aqua as a prime example, revolutionary for Grimes style. The Cocteau Twins also come to mind when listening. In simple terms, the sweetest bubble gum in the most vivid dream pop universe.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book was very improved over the first one of the trilogy.  I enjoyed the development of the characters and the plot but still did not get the connection with the characters that I desired.
B0034EEE2E|4.0|The lead singer has the most beautiful vocals no dream pop/shoegaze lover could ever imagine. Hoarse whispers from angelic creatures singing jazzy solos in unison.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I didn't feel the true love for the characters that I would like when reading this book.  The sex should have either been diminished in frequency or more interesting.

B000R3NNDQ|4.0|2 days after finding out that our boss sold us to a competitor, I saw your book. After finding that the book was about changes, I immediately purchased it on my kindle. I read through it and had the epiphany that our current  team needed to come together and fight for our jobs by working hard and proving our worth.
B004YXE438|5.0|I really enjoy this game/app. I love doing jigsaw puzzles but really good physical ones are expensive and take up a lot of space. Also, I have pets so there is really no place to keep a puzzle safe while you complete it.<br /><br />These video puzzles are a great solution. I have bought all the expansion packs and also loaded a bunch of my own images (of the aforementioned pets mostly) and are enjoying all of them.<br /><br />I am a habitually early person and consequently find myself waiting for other people quite frequently. These puzzles so handily available on my ever-present Kindle Fire HD, I'm sure, have helped keep my blood pressure nice and low.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Fun but I don't like the ads that pop up every time you start a new game. The ads are anoying!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I had so much fun with this game but it is totally addicting. I finally had to send it to the cloud and take a break.
B008133MDK|5.0|Just as good as the first series/season. Wrestles deftly with philosophical dilemmas, too. It presents, in a new way, the centuries-old question: &#34;Can you do terrible things to save innocent people?&#34; It points out our roots in Machiavelli, and even better, digs them up to question them.
B009MO5960|5.0|thought this was the last but low and behold I was wrong again.  Leaves it so open in the end they must be planning endless adds to the Resident Evil series

0920236162|5.0|Great story.  It's a fun twist on the classic princess story.  A good book for the home library.  If you have a daughter, I expect you'll want to read her this story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love love love this game! Hate the pop-up ads. But what do you expect with a free game. Love puzzle games.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|The ONLY reason I did not give this movie a 5 is because they killed something off that I thought was stupid and the whole time travel crap.  But this was really a kickass movie. Bring on some more ....... and a new tv series.<br /><br />End of Line.
0446554995|4.0|As a long time reader of the Preston and Child, or \\"Pendergast\\" novels, as my friends and I refer to them, I was pleasantly surprised to feel that this 12th in the series returned in style and quality to some of the earlier books. I absolutely love the sense of place and addictive plot twists in some of P&C's earlier works, and felt that the most recent novels had lost this. In Two Graves, Preston and Child seem to have rediscovered their passion for Pendergast. This novel is satisfying in that it further explores and develops the back story, relationships, and mystery surrounding Pendergast, Constance, and Helen. It also introduces new characters and raises new questions and problems. One of my favorite things about the Preston and Child novels is that Pendergast as a character develops and grows throughout each book. He and the people close to him are inextricably bound up in the mysteries that they solve, and always changed by them. I think this combination of addictive thriller and character study is part of what makes the Pendergast novels so very special. Highly recommended.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|The movie with the joker ruled this series with an iron fist. It started out really slow too. Fun to watch.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Can you say that you love a book that makes you cringe with anticapation of grief and cry with real sorrow.  I had no idea the book was anything like it is.  I read it because I had given it as a gift after reading a review.  I am so glad I did, this one sticks with me.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|There was one problem though. They needed to flesh out his skills as a scout just a little more by showing what he could do. Also their was another character they should have showed more of in the story. SPOILER ALERT!!! You don't get a 90mph pitching arm by never playing organized ball of any kind and that kind of ticked me off.<br /><br />Anyways, the story could have been handled just a little better. Other than that, it was a great movie. Going to buy it on blueray.<br /><br />End of Line.
1609611543|5.0|Just by eliminating wheat from the diet, you will definitely lose weight.  Add exercise, and you are on your way to a healthier you!  Great book.  You really have to read labels as &#34;wheat or wheat products&#34; are in a lot of foods.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book gives a lot more of the backstory involved with the Halo series.  The book is an easy read and keeps you interested but ends quickly.
B005B0QYMM|5.0|I find it interesting that most if not all of the bad reviews are of the Amazon Instant Video, while the better and good reviews are of the DVD. Why do you suppose that is? Is there a difference in the content of the film or the fact you're watching the Instant Video on a computer or other device, while the DVD is probably viewed on a television in a darkened room? Personally, I thought this movie was very well done. I'm more into the type of film that leaves something to your imagination as opposed to the gory slash'em films which are so obvious. Something that is atmospheric and leaves a little more to your imagination is far better. And this movie sure did that and more.
1423151054|5.0|If you are a fan of animation history, or just a fan of classic Disney animation, owe it to yourself to get this set.  The set itself is beautiful, well put together, and has a timeless quality that makes it seem like it could have been found hidden away in an attic.<br /><br />The books themselves are wonderful. It's truly inspiring looking at the original pencil drawings from well known scenes in, Fantasia, Jungle Book, Pinocchio, Peter Pan and more. One thing that I really enjoy is seeing the animator's charts, tables, and notes. It's very personal seeing these animations in this way.<br /><br />This collection is a treasure and feels like an absolute STEAL at this price.
0765325950|5.0|It's absolutely ridiculous that one has to wait three months for the kindle version. I just can't believe they would be that greedy. However the book is excellent and something I've been waiting for almost 20 years.  I believe that Mr. Jordan's legacy will live on for many generations and am truly grateful  they found someone as talented as Mr. Sanderson to finish the series.
B000VOC90Y|2.0|This is a great laptop backpack, but it will not fit an Alienware M17x R4 in the laptop sleeve.  The fit is REALLY TIGHT and you have to use a lot of force to get the laptop into the sleeve.  However, only about 2/3's of it will fit in the sleeve.<br /><br />You can fit the Alienware M17x R4 outside the sleeve, but again the fit is VERY TIGHT and I'm afraid that the zipper will scratch and wear down the corners, so I use a micro fiber cloth to cover the corners.<br /><br />This was a gift, otherwise, I would return it.<br /><br />The M17x R4 is a 17.3\\" laptop.  Its dimensions are right here:<br /><br />Height: 44.5 mm (1.75 inches)<br />Depth: 304.30 mm (11.97 inches)<br />Width: 410 mm (16.14 inches)<br /><br />Wenger should design their backpacks to fit Alienware laptops, because if it can fit an Alienware, then it can fit anything.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book from an American Hero! This book is an inspiration and should guide our future generations on how to act and behave.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|For most movies, once is enough, but Warrior is one of those rare exceptions, a movie that retains its power each time you see it.  The story builds briskly but naturally to a climax scene that causes the heart to race, the throat to tighten.  Too, as with any truly good movie, you never catch these actors \\"acting.\\"  The performances are convincing, compelling, real.  The actors draw you in, especially Nolte and Hardy.  As for the others, I didn't see a weak performance the entire movie, and that, too, is extremely rare.  Finally, each part of the story is believable, so I never had to force myself to \\"go along\\" with any part of it, and for me, that is huge.  I recommend Warrior, again, and again, and again.  In today's market, this movie has very few equals.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Awesome! Joe Bonamassa is a great guitar player and a fun to watch! The BlueRay Quality is great and the concert is a great performance!

B00000G3AZ|2.0|I enjoyed the book but didn't enjoy the movie.  The lead actors did a good job but I didn't like the other actors.  Wasn't Harriet supposed to be beautiful?  I felt the story was rushed and as a Jane Austen fan I didn't like this adaptation.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I saw the movie in the theater just a week ago, and now I have this soundtrack.  I was very satisfied with the singing while watching the film, and I've also seen the Broadway production (c. 1990) and listened to the 1987 recording hundreds of times growing up.  Listening to this movie soundtrack, the singing sounds really weak and uncertain, in some cases without even good rhythm.  I remember the singing during the film being significantly better.  Maybe I just thought it was better because the film was good, but of course I don't think that's the case.  I am wondering if this is a studio recording of the same actors, but separate from their actual performances used in the film.  If you want the movie soundtrack, or at least the actors from the movie singing the same songs (whether or not the identical performance to what you would have heard in the theater), then I guess this is your cd.  If you just want a good copy of the songs, sung by talented singers and recorded well, I would try out one of of the theatrical recordings rather than this.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|I really enjoyed the story and was excited to watch the movie.  The movie was cast very well and the leads were perfect.  The reason I did not give the movie 5 starts was because the movie felt very rushed.  I wish they had made the movie longer and developed all the characters and plots better.  The cast was great and I wish I saw additional scenes that I read in the book.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|Nothing like what I expected. My husband has been in the oilfield for over 25 years. Just a BIG disappointment. Would not recommend to anyone

B005WUHAX8|2.0|My otterbox was getting a little old, so ordered the LifeProof.  After following the online instructions for the water proofing test, (which it passed with flying colors), I tried to put it on my iphone.

I plan to return it.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|I was frustrated by the uncanny similarities of the first book and the series Twilight.  This book separates itself from that. It's a better read then the first.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is of the highest quaility.  Season 3 is as good or better than the previous seasons.  If you don't want to watch gore, do not watch this series.  The Walking Dead takes an unconventional but well-worn premise and uses it to test and expand characters that you love or hate.  The situations and relationships are more intense than typical reality, but what they are dealing with and the problems they have are things you can relate to.  Production values are very high.  Acting is very good to excellent at times.
B005LAII8K|3.0|First thing I had issues with(although I am unsure if I needed to change the sound settings) was the HUGE differences in sound level constantly changing all thru the movie. Aside from that the movie was ok but its more of a divorced guilt ridden father theme than a scifi. The movie bummed me out because it went all guilt trippy not far in. If you like movies that make you feel sad about the broken family then this movie is for you. Hmmm not sure why they tried to make this a scifi.... profit I guess however in my opinion this should have been a disfunctional family drama but then it would not have made money at the box office which it did not....
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Of the quadrillion self-published out there, very, very few are actually worth reading. This set is. Well written form all the traditional commercial applications - character development, use of dialogue, setting, etc. One of the few and worth reading. Good things form this author in the future I'm sure.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This show has won so many awards for good reason.  It is literally laugh out loud funny.  Everyone should watch this!
B0076DELIG|2.0|I love Michael Connelly's books and was excited to find this one, thinking it would be as good as the others. The book started off well with a potentially interesting cold case. Harry Bosch is one of my favorite characters and the suspense seemed to be building. However, the writing was not up to Connelly's usual study and I felt that towards the end, he either ran out of ideas or was in a hurry to finish. I found the book plodding and ultimately disappointing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice, basic, big button calculator.  Exactly what I was looking for! No Ads in the way either.  I recommend. Thanks!

B008JFUTT0|4.0|(Caution, plot spoilers ahead) As I sat watching Searching for Sugar Man, an extraordinary story of how a gifted musician experienced fame decades after recording his best works, a little voice kept telling me \\"This is too perfect. There's something wrong here\\". And it turns out I was right, of which more later. Sixto Rodriguez was an earthy Bob Dylan-like singer-songwriter from Detroit who released two well-reviewed albums in the early 1970s which flopped completely. He then vanished and was never heard of again. Unknown to him, though, his records became wildly popular in South Africa, where his message that people could think for themselves reverberated in a society where even privileged whites felt oppressed by apartheid. Once the old regime had fallen two South African fans decided to track down the mysterious singer and through hard work, perserverance and luck, they discovered he was alive and working on a construction site, completely clueless about his enormous popularity halfway around the world. They brought him over to South Africa in 1998 and he gave six sold-out concerts, finally immersing himself in the kind of adoration he'd missed out on the first time round. It's a great story, the music is great, and the effect is tremendously uplifting. Finally, a poor beaten-up guy gets the recognition he deserves.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's not the complete story. While Rodriguez may well indeed have had no idea of his standing in South Africa, he wasn't entirely divorced from the showbusiness side of music either. For all the film would like you to believe Rodriguez gave up music in 1973 or so to help tear down buildings in Detroit, he toured Australia in both 1979 and 1981. The more I think about this the more disturbed I am. The film makers did not include this very important fact in Searching for Sugar Man, perhaps because it would spoil the clean sightlines of their own film. So however impressed you may be by this tale, and it is indeed very impressive, be aware it isn't the entire story.

0385535147|3.0|I found it annoying that the reader was left ignorant of the protagonist's scheme for half of the book. Also, I did not connect with the characters because of the unbelieveable things they did for 3/4 of the book. Quinn--as a repeat criminal would have demanded an attorney during his interrogation: Vanessa--only a slight meeting with Mal and then becomes his partner in crime: Max--after three weeks post face surgery (similiar to a facelift) he is only able to move about in a wheelchair. The beginning set up for Nathan was too long and drawn out. I felt most of this book was just a reporting of aseries of events. There was really no conflict to make me worry.  How about when Venessa drives for 12 hours with the gold in her car and we hear about all the cities she drives through but no suspense here (maybe a cop should have pulled her over for some minor offense?). I also had a hard time following Max in all his stops to drop/deposit gold.<br />I did keep reading to see if the story would go somewhere and at the end it did explain all.

B008MEM24S|5.0|Me &amp; my 7yr old loves watching Phinas &amp; Ferb/ Where My Water, so we wasn't dissappointed! Love this game with its twist &amp; turns. We give it 5 stars!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Didn't think I'd enjoy this series at first, I mean it's about Vampires... I was wrong.  Fantastic show!  Highly recommended
B001GMQALY|5.0|I saw this in the eighties, but forgot what it was about.  Got it free on prime.  Mickey<br />Rourke was a hottie back then.  What did he do to his face?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm almost sad to have to think this is the end.  What a love story this turned out to be.
0545265355|5.0|Loved this set! Great value. The case holding the books is very helpful and easy to fit into shelves. Books were a fantastic read.
B000H6FE1M|5.0|Bought 2 of these: one for my 2nd-grader who collects schleichs and one for her teacher who collects hedgehogs. Great deal on a quality toy!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love batman. this was awesome. seen them before. as was expected. the added features are kinda lame though. THERE ISNT ANY INTERVIEWS WITH HEATH LEDGER BTW.
B005LAII8K|1.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the movie in the theatre and was looking foreward to the home/mobile experience and maybe even some of the director commentary. However. The process of having to set up x2 Sony Accounts w/ passwords link the accounts then for the iOS download, install and set up another account with another password and unscucessfully link the Flixster account to the linked up UV account.<br /><br />Never got there. So frustrated with the process that I deleted the iOS app and just shut down the UV account w/ the promise to not get any more product with this \\"Feature\\"
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Awesome!!! Laughed my *** off!! Not for kids but hilarious :) brings back old memories plus has a kick of fantasy in there..
B003O86FMW|5.0|The sequel is just as good as the first book. Looking forward to finding out what happens in the third book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read many of Nicholas Sparks' novels. Safe Haven is BY FAR one of my absolute favorites. An amazing story filled with love and heartache.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|A very family friendly film with lots of laughs and beautiful animation.  What was unexpected was usually these movies have a love story, good vs evil story line, however this movie was more about family dynamics, specifically the relationship between mother and daughter.  So in that regards not at all what I expected, but it was an enjoyable movie.  Awesome?  No, great, yes.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|johnny deep did it agian hes movies r good if you are a johnny fan this movie is funny,sexy but strange the rest of the actors role did a good job must see.
B0068THAGY|1.0|This movie was AWFUL and I'm not exaggerating. Maybe if the cast were adults it would have been better, but I doubt it. It's one of those movies where the trailers are better than the real thing. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|AWESOME find.  Got this super cheap ($16??), and was well worth it.  Very cool looking set; awesome movies; some nice bonus material too that came with it.  If you loved the Batman movies, which you should because they're awesome, this is a great collector set to grab.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Awesome time killer! As fun as the boardwalk! Great buy....and totally worth it! I will be recommending this to all my friends and family. Great for most ages!!!
0756655307|5.0|Bought this for a christmas gift, My nephew loves it, Now he can look up all the supers and not ask me who they are.
B009MO57H6|1.0|If I was able to put zero stars I would. This sequel is just horrible. There way too much fighting, hardly any dialogue. I have the complete series on Resident Evil & this is the worse one. I not even going to keep the movie because I have intention to see it again. I got SO tired of the fighting that I put it on fast forward. Unless I was so bored that I missed it, but there is no explanation on what happened to the characters: Claire, her brother & K-Mart. Also, all resident evils kill off characters that really make the movies. I have no clue what is going on & not about to watch it again. In Afterlife the character (will spell wrong) Westler was evil & one of those things. In this movie he isn't. What's that all about? He wants Alices' help yet according to Afterlife he was better than Alice. Plus he wanted to kill off the humans & in this one he wants to save them.<br /><br />REALLY, REALLY DISAPPOINTED!
B009K72RRS|5.0|This clone wars series has been building up to one of the most exciting and well written mini series I've ever enjoyed. It's great combination of plot twist, great action and witty comedy makes the entire series enjoyable for youths and adults. And most importantly, appeals to everyone. Avid Star Wars fan or not.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I just bought a blu ray player a couple weeks ago and I immediately bought all three seasons of the original series on blu ray and I've got to say, I've never seen the original series look so good. The quality is unreal and the way they have cleaned up the old footage and also with the new cgi added in, the Enterprise and planets have never looked so good. The picture quality and sound is amazing and I couldn't be happier. Excellent job making this on blu ray and to me there's no other way to watch the original series now, so awesome! Very highly recommended! If you are a Star Trek fan even the least bit, this is a must have for your collection, you will be amazed, trust me!
B009JBZH54|5.0|A must have in your collection.. and the UV copy is a huge plus.<br /><br />All the three movies are awesome
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|An absolutely stunning book I've never read anything like it the hunger games is astonishing in the telling catching fire blew me away mockingjay was unlike anything I've ever seen before these books will remain on my shelf to the end of time

B0070Y46UY|2.0|I wanted to close my eyes as I read about the cruel animal killings. I skipped them and finally abandoned the book
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Life's lessons taught so simply, yet so profoundly. An excellent and amazing read, a great reference material. I consider this a very worthy investment.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I would recommend this over & over! no more messy counter tops- and no more putting<br />contaminated utensils back in your food!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this book ! I would recommend this book to anybody. I was always surprised by the story ans could never predict what would happen next I could never put it down and read this book within days
B000SGSU58|5.0|I am a fan of MC--this is one of his best!  Held my interest throughout---stayed up until 4a.m.--just could not put it down.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|Every time I'd start reading again, I couldn't put it down. The emotions in this book are so alive;you feel every detail walk out of the page.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|So looked forward to seeing another Bruce Willis flick-so was a bit disappointed.  Gordon-Levitt's character was flat and uninteresting.  The plot was at times loosey goosey and the ending went flat.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Most amazing book ever realistic and yet filled with different monsters and magic. Even as good as Lord of the rings
B004JKLBUU|5.0|She absolutely loves it. This was one of my childhood favorites and it's still one of the best picture books to use when teaching a child to read. It's a must have for all children.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|It's been quite a while since I bought a whole album,but when my daughter played this for me I knew I had to have it. Not my 70s or 80s rock, but this group has a great feel for what moves people. The rhythm and the uptempo of the songs, not to mention the strong lead vocals make fun. a great group to listen to.<br /><br />Watch for some strong language, but still a great cd.
B004V6MWFU|4.0|I was very circumspect about listening to an entire album of music where the ukulele was the only instrument to back up his vocals, but I can assure you, it's all he needs.  These songs are achingly beautiful, and for those of you who are Pearl Jam fans (I'm one), they open up a whole new side to this multi-faceted talent.
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|Though I've been only half on the Dylan train for a number of years, I enjoyed this more than I've enjoyed a lot of his newer recordings. His voice is gone (not that he ever had much of a voice), but its gravely, rough texture gives a new quality to his recordings. I enjoyed Duquesne Whistle as much as I have enjoyed anything he's done in a long time.
B00AMSLRAC|4.0|My girls love all of the Dr. Panda games. These are very well done, cute graphics and good gameplay. Highly recommended!

B008YWY0HK|2.0|This is not a typical pixar film. It's like Beauty and the Beast + the Little Mermaid + some other new age hippie film I can't think of. I actually regretted watching this which I have never said about any Pixar film.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Put me to sleep in minutes! Love the book! I want another book by Charles Dickens! It deserves five stars
B001S86J2Q|3.0|The audio in this release is really messed up. When it is a spoken part it is low and no amount of turning it up will help. But then when it starts one of the musical numbers it is normal. I find it very annoying. The video itself looks fantastic.
B008RTE08E|4.0|amazing visual quality the remastering engineers got from the old 16mm color film with which &#34;mystery&#34; was filmed. and the sound quality was superb. now for the story..... what story? this was a stream-of-consciousness fever dream of a movie, directed using a pie chart! but it was a piece of the 60s and as such might be considered a historical document. for that reason it is in my collection now.
1579129129|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my son and was tickled when he told me he'd recently seen it in a bookstore and wished he'd bought it for himself.

B009RI4FRU|4.0|This movie was funny and unpredictable as well as visually appealing. It also managed to be more lighthearted than other Wes Anderson films, and the relationships felt more authentic. Be forewarned though; there are a few scenes that young children should not see (a dog is shot and killed accidentally with an arrow, and the 2 pre-teens come very close to having sex)
B00076RT24|5.0|Great movie and came in great condition. The price was good as well! It is very hard to get these movies not on blue ray and my car doesn't play blue ray.  This was a great find.

0812993357|5.0|Grace Coddington was born and grew up on a fogbound, thinly populated island off the northern coast of Wales. She lived a middle-class life as the daughter of the manager of the 32-room Trearddur Bay Hotel. \\"It was a plain building with whitewashed walls and a sturdy gray slate roof, long and low, with the understated air of an elongated bungalow.\\" It was a family run business for families who liked to get away from civilization and rough it on the windswept beach with the icy Irish Sea slapping against the shore. Here a pretty little Welch girl grew up playing and dreaming of the fashion world she read about in the magazines or saw on the nearby village movie screen.<br /><br /> She eventually went off to London to take a two-week course in how to be a fashion model and presto, she was soon a paid model, although some of her first modeling assignments involved her modeling her birthday suit as she ran through the woods like a gazelle.<br /><br /> Her timing for entering the London fashion scene was perfect. The fashion business was much simpler and all models did their own make-up for example. The city was just beginning to come into it's own both in the music and fashion world. She did very well and became a favorite of most of the soon-to-be famous fashion photographer super stars. She made friends with many of the soon to be famous models, actors, photographers and musicians.<br /><br /> The memoir is full of photographs of Grace modeling and Grace working as a stylist and creative director of Vogue Magazine both the British Edition and later the NYC edition. One of this reviewer's favorite pictures in the book is on page 173 and it shows Grace powdering the cheeks and nose of Prince Charles for his official investiture photograph, at Windsor Castle, 1968. He is wearing his crown; fur lined royal robes and holding a scepter in his right hand and gripping his bejeweled sword with his left hand. For a commoner to be so close to his royal highness must have been a huge thrill for the gal from a tiny island off the coast of Wales.<br /><br /> As a former photographer in Grace's age group, this was a wonderful trip down memory lane for this reviewer. She was constantly describing the photographers, other models, and clubs and fashion industry of that amazing period in London history. For younger readers, this may have seemed like all Grace was doing was saying she went here, there and everywhere and saw everyone who was anyone. However, for members of her generation her descriptions of past places and events were great because we all lived through that era and it was familiar to our generation.<br /><br /> The pictures in the book are fascinating.  Even the 2012 group portrait of some of the Vogue photographers she has enjoyed working with was fascinating. It's nice to see pictures of Mario Testino, Ellen von Unwerth, Annie Lebovitz, Bruce Webber, Herb Ritts, David Bailey and various others.<br /><br /> The book is lavishly illustrated with pen and ink drawings by Grace. She has also sketched the models parading in fashion shows rather than trying to describe their outfits.<br />Obviously she is very fast with her sketching and hates to be interrupted while working along the fashion runway. \\"My system at the shows is to draw, sketch, put down everything--every single outfit--and worry later whether I liked it or not. Occasionally, I will put a star next to a favorite. Because I don't write about fashion, I don't take notes.\\"<br /><br /> From early in the book Grace points out that she is a very private person and likes her privacy. She and Didier, and her cat family, \\"hardly ever socialize,\\" because she concentrates so hard on her work, she doesn't suffer fools or foolish questions.<br /><br /> For a woman who hated public intrusions into her private life, she remained below the horizon until the release of a recent documentary titled, \\"The September Issue.\\" Once talked, pressured, into contributing to that project by allowingherself to be filmed at work, she suddenly became a celebrity that is now recognized on the street and in the subway. She has found that novelty interesting, although she still guards her private life. That's probably why some readers of the book will feel that they haven't learned much about her inner person or her inner beliefs about fashion. They obviously haven't believed her when she has said over and over in her memoir that she is a very private person.<br /><br /> As Creative Director of Vogue she is still too busy to waste much time talking about her philosophy when she can instead continue to push fashion to new frontiers.<br /><br /> After 50 years in the fashion business she says, \\"It's hard for me to define what is modern, because I am not.\\"<br /><br /> This is a page-turner about fashion and one humble woman's amazing career in the field. Even she is amazed at her spectacular voyage from the misty, wind-swept island of nowhere to the shining apex of the fashion universe.herself to be filmed at work, she suddenly became a celebrity that is now recognized on the street and in the subway.

B003V4AK8E|5.0|My fiance is going to paste in his review of this remote:<br /><br />I have been using the standard \\"dualshock\\" remote and others, since around the time PS1 was released.<br />(I was in my early 20's at the time) Being a man with very large hands, I found the original(PlayStation=PS heretofore) design flawed. When grasping the PS controller with both hands using the middle, pinky and 2nd fingers, leaves a large gap for the index finger and thumb, to close in onto the 4 front bumper buttons and directional arrows, Tri. Cir. X & Sq. Buttons,as well as the dual joysticks. This as you might imagine, causes longer delays in reaction time, because of finger closing the gasp to the buttons, differences. Also the lack of concave tips(joysticks) causes thumb slides, during gameplay.<br /><br />Without modification add-ons like pelican trigger & FPS freek:<br /> http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B001AW156U/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8&condition=new<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_kk_1?rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Afps+freek&keywords=fps+freek&ie=UTF8&qid=1357676989<br /><br />Getting the best control of Stock PS style controllers, would be impossible.<br /><br />Power A has solved this issue, with an intuative controller that amounts to near perfection for the trifecta, issues with PS controller. Some would say Xbox created the first controller like this. Not true, I saw them before the xbox release(around PS2 timeframe), by now defuncted companies. Their style might not have been at the par, they now, but still they were functional.<br /><br />I have never experienced, the \\"lag\\" other reviews claim exists, between, this and stock PS3 controllers, but I don't allow anything to block the direct line of sight between, the controller, and USB transmit/receive device plugged into a direct USB port, I use the other for NZXT Cryo notebook cooler http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0014GVZS0<br />To keep PS3 from getting freez-ups due to hot GPU chip(video) and other internal parts, then connect Sony's Move Wand/dual controller charger, and other accessories to those USB ports<br /><br />The the two rear grips, that make the power A the most stable in gameplay, also allows the user to hold this controller with just the, hands(knurled backs allow skin to breathe), using the 2nd and pinky fingers, with the L2 /R2 triggers having a slip guard, allowing full control with the index, pointer, and thumb, while preventing the pinky's from slipping off! The analog sticks, directional arrows, and 4 buttons, have powerful springs, allowing fast return, to default positions, while still providing faster movement functions.<br /><br />I had a Batman Arkham asylum controller, (madcatzs with Treyarch) that the 4 action buttons springs, which got soft within 2 weeks, & was RMAed another, unfortunately, it did the same. You don't see them less then 2 years after their release. This is the 3rd Power A, we bought.

B0071DJZZA|4.0|Explains a lot more than the movie, absolutely a must-read series! Definitely addicting as well, you can't put them down.
B009SJ3H8Q|1.0|I didn't see the episode. I had to ask for a credit. This I thought was a prime series, however, it seems only season 1 is.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was an amazing read. I didn't expect to pick it up and read to the wee hours of the morning (6AM). Amazon had recommended I read this book and I am glad they did. The story-line did not falter and it was not a stereotypical love story; for that I am glad. This book definitely belongs in the top 100 on Amazon. Hopeless will leave you wanting more, you were warned. You will fall in love with the friendships, romance, and despair that is Hopeless. The characters were well-rounded; the vocabulary used was not difficult to understand. The fact that the chapters were periodical and that worried me as I had just finished The Perks of Being a wallflower however, the use of dates only adds to its perfection. I am now contemplating, reading it again. If you bought the Kindle edition, you should definitely buy a paperback version for your bookshelf. Share this book with everyone that loves a good story. Well done, Colleen Hoover.
B004EPZ070|5.0|This is a great movie to add to a collection of just fun flicks to watch and enjoy!  Well worth the money!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series of books kept me wanting more. After the first, I had to read the rest of them. Such a tragic story that somehow mirrors reality.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Our government can do se awesome, but scary stuff. The main character (Corey) is used as bait to capture a terrorist living and working in Yemen. The author keeps you guessing just what side the various Americans working at/for our embassy  are on. A bit loquacious using the terrorist's given name when \\"the Panther\\" would do. I expect it will be picked up by Hollywood soon.

B009HEJXFS|3.0|This rendiition of MIB had too much of a soap opera effect. Earlier MIBs were kinky and funny. This one was too serious with too much personal stuff going on. So, I was mildly disappointed. But I remain a fan of MIB out of loyalty.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Excellent storyline.  Clint Eastwood is still an amazing actor at 82 and Justine Timberlake and Amy Adams do a great job as well.  Just a feel good movie with a nice ending...who doesn't need that these days???
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|I had no problems streaming the movie to my Sony Bravia and it looked great. As for the movie, i think it is one of pixars finest. It is extremely fun to watch and evoked more emotion than I would expect from an animated piece.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We had not watched Downton Abbey at all until a friend told us about this series.  We ordered the first two seasons and fell in love with the story, the characters, the costumes and the beautiful setting.  We loved not having commercials or having to change discs after each episode.  We will purchase Season 3 and all future seasons--many we hope.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|LOVE it! Please make them into movies!! I absolutely love this series sooo much! Please hurry up with the last book!
B009PAETCG|1.0|watch the links the lure kids online where people are posting photos kids shouldn't see, sexy photos and stuff...the game seems free to lure kids online
B0000C1733|5.0|This cd arrived in good condition. This cd contains a lot of Chilies hits that will keep you rocking from start to finish
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I wanted so much to love this movie and was excited to rent it.  It was not at all what I was hoping for.  A little funny, but still hard to get through.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is a very talented singer who shows a lot of herself with this album. The album has a lot of hits that is good from start to finish
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I watched the series recently after the Sci channel ran a marathon and had to get the movie.  It was an entertaining film and fans of the series will enjoy getting to see Firefly with a bigger budget.
B009RH973I|5.0|So happy with the case I purchased. Very nicely made & arrived in a timely manor. My daughter loves the color
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|streaming quality was great as always! Love this movie. I think they tied this trilogy together quite nicely. From the set to the cast...simply fantastic
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love this games you have to get it
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Much better than I expected. I have already watched it twice. The whole family laughed great for tweens and teens
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|just too much action &  too little story. Not that I'm expecting high drama here, but it seemed there was ONLY lots of posing & shooting and nothing new.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I love this series and had been looking forward to getting the complete set! Unfortunately, some of the episodes skip and some absolutely refuse to play and cause my DVD player to freeze. I tried playing them on a different DVD player and had the same problem. Amazon sent me a new set free of charge and I'm having the same problem. I guess I'll have to send this one back too :(
B0010SKUYM|5.0|this book is unbelievable, I recommend it to everyone, the chraftwrs are complex and real, the world is methodically crafted with huge amounts of detail, any wheel of time of time or tolken Fan would approve
0545259096|4.0|I had been waiting for the conclusion to this trilogy. It was worth waiting for. I liked the fact that we got to know more about Isabel and Cole. There were times when I screamed out \\"NO!\\" and was saddened that I couldn't stop what happened. (Even though most have probably read this, I don't want to let out any spoilers.) And then so joyful at some things and hopeful for others.<br /><br />Ms. Stiefvater has created a great trilogy here. It's romance and really all types of love and relationships at their best...and worst. Lovely stories that keep me quite enthralled. The characters are endearing. The writing is wonderful and keeps you turning the pages.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|Unimpressive flimsy plastic casing and doesn't work for very long. Too bad because the pictures were so cool. Very lame.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Good thing the show had Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones or I would have turned it off in 20 minutes!
B000EWD1KK|5.0|Great picture by Danny Kaye, some of his best work. Loved it and it was in great condition when it arrived.
B009A882D0|5.0|- completion of the CCR collection already in possession<br />- no dislikings on this cd.<br />- cd should be with every CCR-fan
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Just what I needed when stumbled with words, and very simple, yet filled with resources.  Love the dictionary.  I would recommend to anyone.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|digital books are perfect and easy to use! They take up no space on the bookshelf and are always with you!!!
0765325950|5.0|NOTE: I tried to make this review as spoiler-free as possible but still enjoyable for people that have read the book. You might not want to read it if you want to go into the book with an absolutely blank slate, but none of the book's surprises are spoiled if you do read it.<br /><br />--------------<br /><br />I know there are no endings to the Wheel of Time and this is merely AN ending, but I still can't believe the Wheel of Time is over.<br /><br />This book is a perfect ending. The main theme of the Wheel of Time has always been balance between two opposing forces - saidin and saidar, Darkness and Light, good and evil. The resolution of the story carries that philosophy to its logical place - there's no other way it could've ended.<br /><br />Don't go into this book expecting all your questions to be answered - some are, but a lot aren't. It feels right, though - there are far bigger things going on.<br /><br />Most of this book involves battles. Tarmon Gai'don is the Last Battle, and the stakes are truly desperate. The book does a great job of conveying the scale of this conflict, even though it's exhausting to read about. Any less, and it would've been too easy to win. The usual \\"no one dies\\" approach that the rest of the books have does not apply. Some very bad things happen to very good people, and death seems better than some of them. Our heroes are outnumbered and outmaneuvered, and it shows. Even at the end, you're not left feeling like it's been a great victory - you're horrified. There's still hope, though, and that's what matters.<br /><br />Of course, it's not all bleak - there are several moments where characters are really awesome, including some unexpected ones (Gaul, you are the man). There are some very touching moments between people (one of my favourite ones involves Annoura Sedai and Berelain). There's even some humour - usually Mat or Talmanes are involved (although, one fan theory concerning Demandred gets a very unsubtle nod). Long-awaitedprophecies are fulfilled in unexpected ways (Logain's glory and Seanchan helping Egwene, I'm looking at you!) And there are still some cool plot twists.<br /><br />The battles are not just about swords and spears and the One Power, there are several maneuvers by both sides that were absolutely brilliant. What seemed like throwaway incidents in the previous books come into play in a very clever way.<br /><br />I liked that Perrin, Mat and Rand were fighting on different \\"fronts\\", so to speak. Their special strengths were uniquely suited to what the forces of the Light needed, and brings their character arcs to a satisfying close. Most of the characters got a satisfying ending, not just the ta'veren, but my favourite was Birgitte's.<br /><br />We finally get to meet Demandred (I guessed right about where he was!), and he's quite formidable. I'm used to the Forsaken being easily balefired/defeated by our heroes, but not Demandred. Some adversaries that I thought would have a much bigger role end up not being a huge threat, though.<br /><br />I really couldn't see how the multitudes of issues with the Seanchan would be tied up in time for Tarmon Gai'don, but it's handled very neatly. A completely unexpected character ends up playing a pivotal role, and I hope that the Seanchan system of institutionalised slavery can end because of that character. The Black Tower plotline's resolution was not quite so satisfactory, but it works pretty well.<br /><br />I kind of wish there was more of an epilogue, but I think that's just me being selfish and wanting to see the dawn of the Fourth Age. It's probably a good thing there wasn't one, judging by the Harry Potter epilogue.<br /><br />It's rare that I say this about a book that ends a much-loved series, but A Memory of Light is everything I wished for and more! Thank you, Robert Jordan for creating this incredible world, and thank you, Brandon Sanderson for doing such an excellent job giving us a satisfying conclusion.

B003UYUP58|5.0|I found this book to be well-researched, well-written, interestingly presented, and engaging.  The analogies and metaphors used in the &#34;war on cancer&#34; provide an insight into this closed community of medical professionals and researchers.  Much can be deduced from this and applied to scientific discovery in other fields.  Parallel developments in statistics and indicators of progress are described as a critical part of the cancer story.  Politics, personal and professional relationships, culture and societal norms dominate what treatments are explored and used to describe the journey of scientific and social discovery of multiple forms of cancer.  Well worth a read -- whether a scientist, oncologist or just interested citizen.

B003PTP4S6|5.0|Some of the most beautiful music ever written.  Yo-Yo Ma's cello cries out emotion.  A truly amazing CD and well worth it.  Whenever you listen, you'll be in a much calmer mood by the end of this CD.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey season 2 continues the outstanding story-telling that was begun in the first season.  The characters are very real, the &#34;Upstairs-Downstairs&#34; tensions and empathies are understood, acknowledged, and sometimes almost central to the story.  We love it!
B002RKSZKI|5.0|digital books are perfect and easy to use! They take up no space on the bookshelf and are always with you!!!
B008AUGEFC|3.0|There are certain tricks authors seem to use to challenge themselves, like trying to write an entire novel without using the letter e.  In this book, Mitchel has come up with an unusual technique.  While I'm sure it took a lot of skill, it detracted from the story in my opinion. I had to force myself to keep reading for the first third of the book.  After that, I did enjoy it. It is a great book for book reviewers and college professors to talk about; not so great for the reader.  It is a fine book to borrow from the library or from a friend. I can't imagine how it can be made into a movie that resembles the book in any way, but that might be a good thing in this case.

B008IJTFYW|3.0|This app is wonderful. As wonderful as it is, it has one huge flaw. It won't play in the background!  I was planning to purchase the pro version, and then I found out the flaw.<br /><br />One star for no background play, five for the other things about the app. If there comes a fix to play in the  background you will have me as.  paying customer.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for my 8 year old grandson and he loved it, but so did his 13 year old brother.  I see where it would help improve concentration and small motor skills.

B007ZCQJOM|5.0|From start to finish Bloom is a gorgeous example of dream pop.  While I like &#34;Myth&#34;, &#34;Wild&#34;, and &#34;Lazuli&#34; the most, there are no weak songs and the production, arrangement, and composition is both consistent and tasteful.  I understand reviews of the album that find it too mellow and lacking emotional gravitas, but I can't bring myself to blame the album for being exactly what it claims to be, and after several times through the album I found some energy and substance that I missed the first time around.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Received in a timely manner.  Wonderful movie to add to any collection.  I also received notification of an instant movie, but didn't use it.  So I can't comment on that.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This was a very interesting and intense read...a page turner..liked how it was a different person each chapter..didn't like some of the gruesome parts about the devil worshiping...
B0063IH60K|5.0|A challenging, fun game almost as good as holding a deck of cards and playing hour after hour after hour...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|its the best app any one could have I think we should give it to people by like haling or something and giving it to them just get the peoples address and send this app to them to make this the most popular free app!!!!!!!!

B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This book was a total waste of money.  The story is idiotic and 100% unbelieveable!<br />The 5 star reviews are FALSE AND MISLEADING . The story is totally boring from begining to end.  The whole book and whole story are grossly stupid and ignorant.<br />I'm 100%  certain the 5 star 4 star 3 star and 2 star reviews are rigged by Amazon.com .  No one can write such totally stupid ignorant stories such as this and get anything above  2 stars!  I'm closing my account at Amazon for listing these false and misleading positive comments.  This woman would be best off writing stupid comic books that a 4th grader would read.  All the positive comments are total complet Lies!  The story is too stupid and grossly ignorant to be interesting.  It is 100%  boring and a waste of my money.  I want an immediate full<br />refund today. I am serious.  If I do not get a full immediate refund today, I will be contacting the US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE  and order an investigation and charge Amazon.com with Mail Order Fraud.  These positive reviews are a fraud and are false!  I want an immediate full refund today for this totally worthless idiotic stupid ignornat book!  Confirm full refund today!

B007T2XC7A|5.0|She has nothing recorded that I don't own. I could listen to her voice for days on end and never get sick of it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Our daughter was playing this on her iPad and we thought it looked fun, so we both got it on our Kindles. Prepare to be addicted. It's a very zen activity. We love it! It's super simple to play, but quite interesting. It's also great brain-training for electronics design.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|The dog was so loyal to his master and it made me happy and sad that he would wait until he died for his master.<br />Loved the movie and bought one as a gift.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I feel transported into another world when I watch this show.  It is well written, interesting and a classic drama.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is really cool because you get to shot the bad guys and you get a lot of point's you should. get it
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a really funny movie... Waiting for the sequel and I hope the minions appear more in that movie. The minions really steal the show.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Great movie!  We laughed through the entire thing!  Mark Wahlburg was great!  Really funny to hear his &#34;real&#34; Boston accent
B00ARAO720|4.0|It's no Inception or MI movie, but it's entertaining and action-packed. I found the acting terrible (except Gordon-Levitt, who is always great) and the premise a bit ridiculous. But, I still liked it :)
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I ALSO DOWN LOADED THIS APP, AND WAS UNABLE TO FIND IT. SO I TRIED IT AGAIN, AND WAS TOLD IT WAS ALREADY DOWNLOADED. STILL CAN'T FIND IT. NO STARS
1439153663|5.0|I cannot express how much i loved this book! It is heart-churning and amazing!!! It is a great southern read that shows many details of the time period and the struggles and bonds of those living in it. Read it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is fun and relaxing.  Easy to use, colors and graphics are great and the different degrees of challenges in the game are a plus.

B004TI1WME|4.0|the app. is put together in a very easy format. I would recomend it to anyone. thanks for comming up with it.
0765325950|1.0|I began reading this series in 1992 when a friend loaned me the first book.  I've been enthralled ever since.  I'm sad and a bit relieved (20 years!) that the end has come.  To show my appreciation to the author I purchased a copy of every book on the day it came out. Except for this one. I no longer purchase paper books and was forced to wait on a friend to finish reading her copy before I could borrow it.  It's great so far, but I'm not very far into it as the bulky size makes traveling with it difficult FOR ME.  I fully intended to show my appreciation to the author(s) and the estate again by purchasing a copy on the day of release, but was unable to and will have finished it by the time Apri...Better not say, or I'll be reported and verbally harangued by upset paper only folks.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|Awesome movie !! Loved that is was based on a true story !!!! It was very touching to watch with the whole family !!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is such a wonderful fun game! Even my 5 year old wants to play it! Its worth every penny!
B005EVVESM|5.0|Got this for my wife and she loves it.
B008NMT684|4.0|My son really likes this app. He enjoys all of the puzzles and even ask for purchase of the other 7 puzzles.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|Yes, I too could live without the &#34;additions&#34; George Lucas thought we needed.  I don't know what in the world he was thinking as I find them distracting... especially in Episode IV.  The worst offender is the conversation Hans has with Jabba about paying him later... it actually takes away the sense of urgency to get away!  And the other animations added either look very fake or are just plain annoying.<br /><br />BUT for the price, I will take them.  I'm not one willing to spend the extra (and now that extra is more than the cost of a Blu-Ray player) for the theatrical release.  And the main reason I bought this was so my kids can watch it, so they don't know the difference anyway.<br /><br />Yes, the additions are annoying, but they are minimal and I'm capable of putting up with the extra 3 mins. or so of them and still have a good movie experience with my family.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Enjoyable as a fun action with some connection to Bourne series.<br />Not the greatest movie but the key actors did a great job.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|I ordered this for myself.  At the risk of dating myself, I had this on cassette when I was a teenager and it was nice to hear this again.  I like the packaging (cardboard instead of a plastic case) and I didn't have to fight all the tape to get it open.<br /><br />I do wish the first four recordings were in stereo but understand the studios lost the original stereo tracks... I don't remember, but am willing to bet my old cassette was the same.<br /><br />If I had any recommendation to improve it would be to get it all on one CD, but with so many tracks it would be difficult, if not impossible.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was looking for a good romance novel to read and hopeless stumbld right onto my kindle :) This book was breath taking. I wasnt sure what to expect at first, but it didnt disappoint. I found myself saying things like what if her dad was actually more involved, or maybe Karen knows more than shes letting on. After thinking those things it actually ended up happening. It was a great book!
B000O599WG|5.0|One of my favorite John Wayne movies, and a superb performance by Dean Martin.  Great story of loyalty and friendship.<br /><br />Just a good old fashioned western with lots of great characters... and Angie Dickinson... ooh, la, la!
B005I6EU48|5.0|This was the perfect present for my mom to go with her new kindle fire. It has a wonderful leather look and vintage feel to it, like opening up an old book, but keeps her kindle safe and secure.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|I first saw this on TCM a few years ago having never heard of it.  I love the story line and the performances of everyone is just top notch.<br /><br />Great movie and, as always, Amazon delivers it as promised and safely packaged right to your doorstep.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game and so does my nine-year-old daughter. Very addictive, so be warned! Beautiful, simple graphics. Time passes quickly while playing!
B0025KVLTM|5.0|I had this on vinyl when I was a teenager and had made a cassette recording in the early 80s.  Regretfully, I traded the album in to a record store (a bunch of them, actually) for a few new tapes.<br /><br />Good to hear this in its entirity again, and prefer to own the CD over just a digital download to an MP3 player.  This allows me to put it on my MP3/iTunes and still play the CD in the home or car stereo.  Just my preference.<br /><br />I like the cardboard presentation over the plastic jewel case and appreciate that it wasn't taped so tightly shut so I didn't have to rip or tear it to get it open.
B004AUHWLQ|4.0|This movie makes me want to cry. Although it does have a satisfying ending. Fred MacMurry is a complete ass, but Jack Lemmon is the perfect gentleman--the guy next door.
B000RD0RDU|5.0|I've had this fan running continuously for the past few months and its still running great!  After having 3 silenx fans fail on me over the past year (would get noisy and/or slow down), its nice to have one that gets the job done and not have to replace.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|When this item became available on today's deals and at a price that was a steal, I jumped on it!  Man!  Am I glad I did.  IMHO, I think this is the Star Trek Movie franchise's best movie by far.  Watching it in Blu-Ray is just that much better!<br /><br />Worth the purchase!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just like the title states, this is a masterpiece. Really enjoy the drama. This is building up from the first season. Fantastic
1616890835|5.0|This book will make you want to drop everything and just go paint signs for the rest of your life.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Not very enjoyable.  Theron got to do very little acting. Old plot not very well told.  Maybe you will like it better.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is on of John Grishams best books yet!! I totally enjoyed all the twists and turns.  Kept you guessing til the end.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Fun to watch all the tough guys who fought each other, band together now that they are older.  Just enjoy the fun!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The best show in the history of sci-fi shows! I normally don't like sci-fi but this show is so entertaining, intriguing, scary & even funny! A perfect combination!!
B0063IH60K|2.0|the singles ads are really annoying and inappropriate. especially if you have any younger children playing. if I find another game without it I will definately delete this one.
B009SQRC9E|3.0|I liked it but I thought it was a tad bit too busy....lots going on all around. Maybe it's just me but a kids movie should be maybe more funny and a little less busy?
B005LAJ17M|1.0|I think the program is great, in fact so good that when we realized there were two Disc 3s instead of a Disc 2, we were bereft. Now I have to return the three discs (at my own postage expense) and get a new set... and likely pay postage on that too???Hmmmm..... Something is not right.
B000V675A6|2.0|After I purchased the product & downloaded it to itunes, the sound quality was not good at all.<br />I have the product on wax in an album form, but as you know after a while they lose quality from use. This is why I choose to purchase it from you guys thinking it would be a good quality digitized product.<br />The products I've purchased from Amazon in the past have been wonderful.
B002N1AF7C|4.0|good cd.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|I got this on-line, MP3 download and then burned a copy for the stereo.  My wife played only this Christmas album for five days straight right before Christmas.  She has a ton of Christmas CDs but this one took top honors.  She loves it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I can not say enough about these head phones. Were a Christmas present for my Grandson, and he is and was thrilled. Great performance. and the price was half of what other stores wanted a 5*
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan is always a quick and easy read. He has a mean imagination  and he uses it to tell a great story...
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|When I first heard about this book from my friend I thought it was going to go on and on about facts but in the end it surprised me and was the reason I took 2 weeks just to research all the gaming history I took find that related to the 80`s . So in short I recommend this book to any person who wants to read an interesting book, and when I say interesting I mean interesting.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book made me laugh, cry, angry, happy, upset, hopeless and hopeful . My favorite book I have ever read. I plan on recommending it to everyone and will read it to anyone with a pulse

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This drawing app is easy to use.  It took my no time to figure out how to draw with it.  It offers plenty of great colors, pens, crayons, markers, brushes and background papers.  The tools are simple to understand.  I drew portraits of my husband and dog in no time. It's fun to go back to fingerpainting.  Especially when you can easily erase your mistakes.
B004S4LAAS|5.0|Follett is truly a cut above the rest.  He has a very easy writing style that snares the reader every time he as a brilliant attention to detail bring the story alive.  This storyline is brilliant taking place in occupied France during WWII, fast paced, Excellent read, highly recommend.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Very good book, the same time it had good qualities to the plot and rest of this brilliant, wimpy novel was fantastic
B004S49YEM|5.0|This is a brilliant read, Follett takes you back to WW2 England into a cat and mouse chase of a Nazi spy.  It has so many twists and turns it is sensationally brilliant \\"must\\" read of a book! Yes, one of those keep you up all night till you finish books! Buy with confidence.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|An exceptional production of a remarkable real-life story.  A vivid reminder that overcoming personal problems is something every human must face, no matter how priviledged.  The movie is an excellent review of a terrible moment in 20th century history.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Folliett is a master story teller and transports you back in time and place where you end up getting immersed in the period with all the customs, intrigue, story and strong character interest.  Fantastic read following these Families across all continents around the history leading up to WWI.  Great writing style and editing 10 out of 10 must read.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book. It opened me up for newer ideas.  The only part of this book that got on my nerves was the way Anastasia's constant crying and whining. I was at the point where I thought that she should start carrying around a case of tissues with her. How many sleeves was she going to need to wipe her nose on. I would refer this book to all my  who had a little bit of a kinky side to them.
B0039N74CW|4.0|I now have the complete set of Shrek movies.  My great-granddaughter is thrilled to be able to watch these movies at home.
B000XUBC5E|4.0|I really enjoyed this book but can someone please help me with the ending? The \\"Ghost\\" put a newpaper clipping in Will's pocket referring to \\"man found dead in car. Cray(sp) Spring, off-duty police officer with Cramden force, was found strangled in his car. Apparently the victim of a robbery...local police said his car was found in the parking lot behind a local bar...\\". Please forgive me, but to which part of the book was this referring? I've evidentally forgotten something and can't understand the significance of this article. Please explain because it's driving me crazy!
B000641D2Y|5.0|This movie was my favorite of the series.  It's a great movie for young and old.  I would recommend it to all my family and friends.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a pretty good book.  Only problem was that you don't really get that end of book closure and sense of justice that you want.  You will never guess how it ends.  That I  good, and bad.  Still a good read.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This music is from the movie.  When you listen to it you enjoy it and remember the movie.  Have fun.
0805053883|5.0|For young children, Eric Carle's illustrations always seem to please.  This book is no exception.  My boys have the whole bear series and they get read - a lot.  While I may may be a little tired of them, I don't think my boys can ever be.  As a bonus, other then Brown Bear, the bear series teaches kids about a whole bunch of animals.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Nice to have a movie that keeps you thinking.  Great story!  Just when I thought I was sick of time travel stories, this adds something new.

B009NQKXYK|3.0|I was hoping for some classic sci fi, but this isn't it.  The visual style is intersting and the effects are good, but honestly I could watch the beginning of alien over and over, and this movie is only worth one watch.  The origin story is pretty cheesy as well.  The only thing I will remember is the &#34;eyeball&#34; scene.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|This was a movie that I had been wanting to get for quite some time. I am very pleased with it and enjoy watching it. Great purchase, fast shipping. Bought this mainly to replace the old VHS that wore out.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Unlike a lot of kids movies, even without a &#34;G&#34; rating it wasn't too scary for my sensitive 3 year old.
B0041QSZJM|1.0|I love Pink Martini...but this entire album was completely phoned in. The arrangements are unimaginative and trite...and just don't make sense. White Christmas sung in Japanese but with a completely traditional arrangement? Intonation is not careful throughout...oh I won't go on. Not sure I even want to give it away.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't wait to get home from work, just so I could read it. I loved it and will be finishing this series for sure.

B006CQLGXG|5.0|I love this version of &#34;A Christmas Carol.&#34;  It has lovely illustrations and worked very well on my Kindle Fire.  It's a classic.  It's different from the movie versions.  I forgot what a sense of humor Dickens had.  I highly recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is a must read for people who love apocolyptic tales. What a pleasure to find great books by little known writers. Without Amazon and kindle I would have never found them. I'm so glad to know that there is more to learn about the people of the silos.  I have already downloaded \\"First Shift\\" and plan to start reading it immediately.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I could not get too interested in the first half of the book and it took me several days to get that far.  The second half was more interesting and kept my attention and I completed it in two days.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have been a long term fan of Tom Clancy.  My favorite was without remorse.  This one was good, but not quite on par with that one.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|This CD is beautiful. I love most of the music she creates. Her vocals are beautiful and the instrumental arrangements carry you back in time. I truly love this CD. I listened to it several times during the holidays. Really got me in the mood.
B000RJO578|5.0|Made me laugh and I had to watch it tiwce since I missed much of the movie, the move and talk so fast, thank goodness for CC or I would never have been able to understand what was going on !
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I'm not going to summarize the story as that's what the back of the book is for (or the synopsis portion online).  This was a great sci-fi read I would recommend to anyone with an interest or curiosity into what our future holds for us.  The reason I found this book so entertaining was that it tried to take an approach as to all those questions about our future that we will never find out about and answer those questions in this book.  Although it's an obviously fictional story, it does a great job of really pulling the reader into it and wondering \\"What if?\\"  In my opinion, the book had it all, it had items about aliens, evolution, and even telekinesis.  Although that may seem like a lot, it didn't feel like it was forced either, and the story unfolded naturally.  My wife hates sci-fi, and I would never recommend her to read this, but if anyone out there is a sci-fi fan, then you can't go wrong with picking this book.
B004LROUW2|5.0|A great read that will keep you intrigued. Normally not a fan science fiction, but this novel has just enough that it isn't to far out there. Worth the long read.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Superb restoration, excellent reproduction, and a compelling backstory (special features). Any serious film lover should include this version in their collection.
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|Hitchcock is the second film of 2012 to depict the great director following the HBO film The Girl, which set its sights on the making of The Birds and Hitch's obsession with Tippi Hendren. Hitchcock primarily focuses on his relationship with his wife Alma Reville and uses the making of Psycho as background noise. Both films attempt to explore Alfred Hitchcock's dark side, but Hitchcock is much lighter on its feet and doesn't seem like a hit piece the way The Girl did. Oddly enough though, this film's subject matter and structure more closely resemble a television film that wouldn't have been out of place on HBO. I attribute the theatrical release of Hitchcock to the stars involved and Oscar hopes. I'm not saying Hitchcock isn't a good film, but it has neither the depth that makes for a great biopic nor the trashy exploitation that made The Girl so provocative.<br /><br />Hitchcock opens somewhat comically at the farmhouse of Ed Gein (Michael Wincott) as he murders his brother with a shovel before the tumescent Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) himself directly addresses the camera. From there, a reporter at the premiere of his latest film North by Northwest asks Hitchcock if he thinks he's past his prime, which sets him obsessively looking for his next project. After Hitch reads Robert Bloch's novel Psycho he decides to film it, despite receiving little support from those around him. His wife Alma (Helen Mirren), portrayed as his closest confidant and creative partner, eventually warms to the idea but Hitch is still unable to convince the studio and decides to finance the film himself. He then begins assembling the cast, which the film suggests was based entirely on Alma's suggestions. The all-star cast is chock-full of familiar faces, not all of whom are obvious choices for their roles, particularly when it comes to Scarlett Johansson, Jessica Biel, and James D'Arcy playing Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, and Anthony Perkins respectively. Toni Collette (as Hitchcock's trusted assistant) and Danny Huston (as a writer friend of Alma's, who provokes insecurity in Hitch) also co-star.<br /><br />While it appears to be a behind-the-scenes biopic of the making of Psycho, the film's main focus is the relationship between Hitch and Alma. This is fine except, with a running time of less than 100 minutes, it fails to dedicate enough time or substance to either topic. The behind-the-scenes stuff offers up no new (or, at least, obscure) information and the relationship is portrayed very superficially. It treads lightly across Hitchcock's perverse obsession with his leading ladies and makes half-hearted attempts to explore the jealousies and insecurities that made the man tick (often showing Ed Gein as a recurring figure within Hitch's psyche as he takes on the film and his own inner demons), unfortunately the writing is persiflage that burrows to the core of the man about as thoroughly as his Wikipedia page. In one scene Hitchcock tells Alma \\"all men are potential murderers...and for good reason.\\" It's a good line; but it doesn't have the impact it seems to expect it will.<br /><br />Hopkins effectively disappears behind the prosthetics to portray Hitchcock, with his own voice emerging sporadically through the accent. He does a fine job but the screenplay renders his performance into little more than an impersonation that fails to convey any humanity in the character. He seems to be enjoying the role and he's fun to watch, but it won't win him any awards. A scene of Hitchcock standing outside the theater door as Psycho premieres, acting as a macabre conductor of his audiences emotions is one of the most revealing scenes. It's terrific, but it's too little too late. The supporting players do a fine job but their characters are so two-dimensional they're unable to do anything truly dynamic. Johansson doesn't greatly resemble Janet Leigh but is appropriately elegant, charming, and spunky. D'Arcy meanwhile is under-utilized as he instantly nails the timid, fidgety nature of Anthony Perkins. Appearing in only a few scenes, he remarkably resembles the man and, from the moment he appears onscreen, captures his essence. Because Helen Mirren plays a real person that existed more behind the scenes than others, it allows her more room for interpretation and, as such, she gives arguably the film's strongest performance. There are times when her performance alone keeps the film from crumbling under the weight of its own ambition. She gives the relationship between Hitch and Alma a sense of reality that didn't appear on the page.<br /><br />While not a very memorable film, Hitchcock does offer a good bit of behind the scenes fodder. Some of the most enjoyable scenes come from Hitchcock fighting with the censors over trivial issues such as showing a toilet flushing onscreen. The filming of the infamous shower scene is treated with insouciance and ends much too quickly, but is amusing in the way it becomes unintentionally sexy because of Johansson. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, as evidenced by some amusing tongue-in-cheek references to Psycho (during editing, an issue arises over Leigh allegedly blinking), this film itself (the comment about Leigh's breasts), and a final shot that almost suggests an attempted continuity with The Girl.<br /><br />Hitchcock is a well-made film with performances that hold your attention, but I wish it had been able to offer a little something more. If screenwriter John J. McLaughlin had redirected the focus of his script to either the making of Psycho or Hitch and Alma's marriage and kept the focus there, a more effective film could have come from it.  Ultimately Hitchcock attempts a balancing act and suffers for it. While it builds a foundation on an intriguing subject and portrays it an entertaining way; it just doesn't do its subject justice. For a film about such a remarkable man, Hitchcock is almost remarkably unremarkable.
B0037NB6QE|5.0|Anything Debbie Macomber write is going to be good!  This particular book has some good insights about how people can change - especially in attitudes toward others.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Nice programmable gaming pad, used this to play Battlefield 3, Star Wars The Old Republic, & Guild Wars 2.<br />Programmed it along with my G19 with a color script so the colors cycle simultaneously.<br />Don't really use the screen on there unless its to monitor my system with coretemp, fraps, or msi afterburner applets.<br />looks and functions well, i love Logitech products! I recommend!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I loved the Harry Potter novels very much, but here, other then the detailed assemblage of English social life on all economic levels in a small community, no other redeeming qualities come through.  The author has a way of giant prose from few words, retaining intimate detail into their character, but here you feel so repulsed by the characters and they aren't even villainous. It seems JR Rowling may have an ax to grind against her former neighbors, who knows; Evidently, she wasn't very fond of them or her new characters in Casual Vacancy. She paints these people with loathing as she flays their lives apart as petty and boring.  It must be nice for her to so fabulously wealthy now, no doubt, but I would like my fourteen dollars back.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|Great app for some foscam clone ip cams! Works great and wouldn't dream of using another app. I tested the free version but had to get the full.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|Great film, with Flynn at the top of his form. Must watching for teenagers being brainwashed by the NEA. Shows the evils of government when evil people take control.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|\\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" was a little slow to get started, but eventually opened up to an interesting world complete with time travel, children with special powers, and some mysterious enemies to the children.  This is a young adult book centered on Jaconb, an ordinary, spoiled 16-year-old boy from America.<br /><br />The book includes an interesting twist in that the author includes historic black and white pictures throughout the book.  The pictures tie into the story in a variety of funny and quirky ways, although they are not essential to understanding the story.  If you are reading on a Kindle device, you may be a bit disappointed with some of the pictures because they turned out rather dark.  Also, there are two letters that I found extremely hard to read because you cannot enlarge the tiny cursive print although if you have a Paperwhite, you can brighten the screen, which helps some.<br /><br />For parents, the book is relatively clean.  There is some kissing and mild profanity throughout the story.  I wouldn't hesitate to give this to my kids ages 12+.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is the best thing that I have ever read! I read it every day. I can't wait to read the next one!
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This book is well researched and easy to read.  The information focus on character traits that can be taught to children of any age gives hope for professionals working with older teens who may have multiple challenges, including the trauma of abuse and neglect.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|This item came quickly and in excellent condition. I recommend this seller.<br /><br />I love listening to Loreena McKennitt. This new album is no exception. It's very good, though I do like her older albums better.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|This item is available literally everywhere but here it was half as much! The quality is of course great and I would strongly recommend this for anyone else who has a Monster High addict in their life.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a terrific price!! My son already had one of the dvds but at this price who cares?! Well worth the money!
B009NQX48C|5.0|Mark is one of my favorite actors and I try not to miss any of the movies he stars in. Although he is the &#34;bad guy&#34; in this movie he plays it very well.  He's very instense and all too real in today's world. This is a excellent movie about obession.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|The exposition of one very creative, disciplined engineer faced with lethal challenges at every new sol demanded more information regarding the equipment with which he was working.  The science seemed credible but the hardware - hab & rover characteristics - left much to the imagination.  The story held my interest even as I wondered \\"is this for real?\\"
0307155102|5.0|What a wonderful book to learn about the world sitting in your bed. It is  great way to teach toddlers about all the things around. Letters, numbers, seasons, animals, house objects, rooms, farm, zoo, countryside, seaside, tools, playground, school..and so much more!

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Enjoyed this read over the holidays.  It lacks the detail and research depth of clancy's earlier work that  would build up a detailed storyline for 800 pages then crash everything in the 100 pages. This books tends to intermix action throughout the entire book and still have enough technical detail and interesting plot to keep the reader engaged.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout and in only 20 minutes!  combines weights and cardio.  The most bang for your buck!  I really like the 3 level workout.  You can choose your level.  It's a great start to the new year!

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed the story line and the bonus chapter. I just wish these games were longer and had multiple adventure paths.
1449433251|5.0|Ordered the Complete Calvin and Hobbes for my daughters.  They love them and I always see them reading the books.  The books are of good quality and I would recommend this product to anyone who loves Calvin and Hobbes.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Reading this book was an interesting experience... the entire long first section, in my opinion, should have been about 2 pages long.  Throughout the book, it was very much pushing socialism as the great morality, which I personally found exasperating.  Also, the history of every building, etc that went on for chapters at a time got very old.  You can skip all of that and get to the story without missing anything.  The story itself was great, with characters you love to love, and love to hate.  It is full of philosophy and history... this is the first book I've ever read that took a positive view of the French revolution.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun, and simple game. Surprising as I did not expect much, but not is it honestly fun but just as shockingly aesthetically pleasing to look at. Great work, developers.
B0000028RR|5.0|This album takes it to a whole new level of awesome-ness!!!! Best album I heard in years! Makes me wonder if there will ever make a greatest hits album soon. Get this album, it's worth it and u'll love it! Great for any Rage Against The Machine Fan!!!
B001PPGAIK|1.0|Unable to view on my BluRay.. The DVD did not work as it stated unable to view!  Have no idea why my player works with all my other DVD's!
B009GJCFL8|5.0|I been long time Asia fan since they created the band in 1982.  I own all CDs, live recordings, DVDs, etc.  All of them are great, but this one is fantastic, from the set list to the mixing, audio, video, art work and packaging, thus this is the reason I am still buying  CDs or DVDs.  The set list is much better than any previous live recording mainly because they have integrated songs from great records such as Phoenix and Omega which were previously unavailable and all of them sound amazing live.  As well set list is balanced with songs the original lineup have produced such as Asia (4 songs), Alpha (4 songs), Astra (1 song), Phoenix (2 songs) and Omega (5 songs).  Perhaps I would enjoyed if they included at least one more song from Phoenix which is also a great album, however they seemed concentrated promoting Omega which was at that point of time their latest release.  All songs are great and the highlights are I believe, Only time will tell, Never again, Don't cry, Open your eyes, Sole Survivor, An extraordinary life with special remark on Holy War and the always poweful Time Again. They don't need to have a great production in their show and it's enough hearing the music and watching them playing the songs with such intensity regardless their age which is above 60s.  If you want to have a compilation of Asia \\"Wetton, Downes, Howe & Palmer\\" this is in my opinion the best available with the bonus of watching their virtuosity live in concert, including great solos from Howe and Palmer.
B0038P59A0|5.0|excellent movie, and very easy to coordinate with a Roku.  This is a great product and very easy to use.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Good movie.  Enjoyed it very much.  The Dark Knight Rises lived up to the hype.  Probably the best of the Batman shows.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app was for my grandson 7 yrs old- he absolutely loves this! Any child who enjoys construction projects such as Legos- will really enjoy this game.It has his seal of approval and as any grandparent knows, that's good enough for me-as long as it is educational too!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Ive watched this show a few times.  HBO does a good job, no matter what the naysayers nay.  I love mini-series because they can fit in more than if the whole show attempted to fit into a 2 hour movie.  Some things may not be &#34;accurate&#34; enough for everybody, but all in all it is a good deal.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read.  Less pontificating than some recent Grishams.  Kept me guessing ... he's back at what he does best ... spin a yar and keep you reading.  He got all the prison parts down perfectly.  Great popcorn-eating book.
0395389496|5.0|My girls have always enjoyed the movie, so I decided to get them the book this year.  The movie adds alot more excitement, but I think this book brings it back to what the whole story is truly about.

B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I love cut the rope, so I thought I would give this a try. Don't let the first few levels fool you, it gets harder. In fact some of the hard ones are trying to get crowns for all your levels (no stars, 1 star, 2 stars). Oh, and be sure to fling your pudding off the table. The sound are not as &quot;cute&quot; as cut the rope, but it is still funny to here his goofy yell as he goes skidding off the side!
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love How I Met Your Mother. I would especially suggest season 8. It is funny yet emotional. The suspense is killing me!

B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's easy to play and so far hasn't cost me nothing to play. My son likes the preview of the next movie. The game is worth trying.  Much like Sims  games.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It wasn't the funniest movie I've ever seen, and I'm not into Glee kinds of shows, but it was pretty hilarious.  I showed it when I had company and even the guys were laughing out loud (and later said they like it).  That makes it a pretty good movie in my book.  Glad a friend recommended it!
B00493E1GI|4.0|Love the movie. Trying to find balance. I needed this. The spiritual parts were very cool.I recommend it for sure.
B004EPYZPS|1.0|This movie is crap. Another 40-something director making a movie to re-invent their childhood about how magical and smart kids are and how awful and stupid adults are. This movie makes E.T. look good. This movie has absolutely no respect for any storytelling logic other than at the end the kids are all alright. Bite me.
030758836X|2.0|I didn't like the psycopathic theme to the book and the way the book ended not my kind of book

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|wonderful movie for my 2 1/2 year old (and for my wife and me too!).  This movie really caught my daughter's attention and kept it throughout the movie.  Lovely story about self-determination, perserverance, and friendship.  I would recommend this to any and all children.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app was recommended to me and it is very handy to have the ability to quickly see how much power I have left to use. And it,s fun to watch the bubbles rise.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory. It is one of my favorite shows, so I have nothing bad to say about it. Love it! It's so freakin hilarious :) Then again, I'm a science nerd...
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Really great characters in this book, it was a little slow and uncertain to begin, but completely worth the time to get the story off the ground.  Tons of starvation, sieges, single combat, armies chasing each other around, and maidens fair and foul.  Rough around the edges, but I didn't mind a bit, great read.  The Torturer, Ninefingers, the Named Men (Dogman, etc.), all superior fantasy creations.
075669812X|5.0|Xmas gift for my 8 year old, who is a big Ninjago fan.  He loves the book lots of great pictures and info about all the various characters in the Ninjago world.  Plus a major bonus includes a green ninja lego.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put the book down, it kept me wanting to know what happens next. The ending was in no way predictable and I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Does an incredible job of holding your attention and letting your peer into the mind of someone who thinks differently. Good family fim for kids, seniors, and everyone in between.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love this app. very accurate. looks very good. Haven't found anything I don't like yet. Want a weather app.,try this one out.
0399226907|5.0|I loved this book as a child and was thrilled to find it offered as a board book for the littler ones who I think would enjoy it, but might destroy thin paper pages. A classic.
B008Y5OWO8|5.0|Lyrical classic film drama from Akira Kurosawa with some of the most beautiful black and white photography.  A murder and a rape in the forest are told by four different people with considerably differing details.  What is true, what is fabricated?
B000JMKRKC|3.0|I gave this 3 starts because I didn't really enjoy the book as much as I'd hoped! As it was delivered to my Kindle, I have no complaints about the &#34;product.&#34;
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This movie brings answers some of the questions of what would happen to Batman if it came down to Gotham's needs.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|So,so glad I found this. Was just sitting searching for some good Blues and somehow came across it surfing the net, as you do. Sounded good so checked the reviews on this site, as I  do regularly, and knew straight away I'd better take a listen. Didn't take much. I immediately bought/downloaded it. I agree with all the good things that have been said about it whole heartedly. Beth and Joe are both at the top of their game in their own right. I for one take so much pleasure in listening to music of this quality. I wonder if they know how much pleasure they give. I'm still listening as I type, and I'm just blown away. As someone else similarly implied I'm just an old baby boomer but I've had time to listen to a lot of music in my time. This while it's not true down to earth, gritty blues, it's alive and to me and as good as it gets....definitely!!!
B005LAII12|4.0|I think you need to watch this movie with a group of people who love tolaugh.  First time, I watched with a single person, and it wasn't so funny.  Then I watched it with a few buddies, and it was hilarious because of all the laughs.  Make any sense?
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have always loved the movie based on this book, but I had never taken the time to actually read it. I am so glad that I did because it is now one my favorites!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could not put this one down!!!! Loved it!!! You won't believe the things people are capable of. Read this one in two days.
B00000J7M0|5.0|These guys were (are) so good at playing metal that any song of their's I've heard on the two &#34;live&#34; cd's I have sound better than they do on their studio versions. Leggs Diamond is the same way.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I liked the movie a lot.  While some of the actors might not have been top notch singers, they made the movie fun.
1595826971|4.0|I really love the book, but! when it arrived home it was with a lot of wrinkles and mistreated. the same with the other books.<br />Other than that, the information and pictures inside were nice :)
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|Man what a great edition! The sound quality is amazing and easily one of my better finds in a while :D
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|This pin is really nice quality. Heavy duty.  Arrived in excellent shape and the package came quickly.  Great for those special Star Trek occasions.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|What can I say, like with all the good knifes, you either love it or hate it. It is heavy, but the idea is to have only one tool to cover for all the rest: hatched, mini-shovel, even light hammer, etc.... This knife will do all. Are there better knifes than this? Absolutely! But for the money, I doubt it. Compare it with similar type of knifes and you will see.<br />Don't compare this to, let's say Mora knife - different way of using it, different price....
B004SBQAN8|5.0|A good movie for my daughter. She read the book and wanted to see the movie. The movie held my interest and encouraged my daughter to want to read the second and third book. I am glad we got the movie.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much...was as good if not better than the first two movies that came out. Would recommend it to anyone who loves to watch sci-fi movies...once again a great movie!!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Had to sit down and have a marathon watching them all! Great quality films at a great price! Can't wait to watch them all again!
B005LAIGW8|5.0|great movie.. i bought this one for myself...watched it twice... it is as good if not better than the first one that came out....
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I havethe Kindle app on my Iphone, Ipad and android tablet. Anytime there are a few minutes of down time I can read. It's great for the brain.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Cooking dash deluxe deserves the five star rating. I love this game. I just couldn't stop playing on it once I started. If you like diner dash you will love cooking dash too.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I had heard about the book, but few details. Chose it as my first ebook. Had no idea what to expect. Very pleasantly surprised by the story, the characters, and the plot.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This is a good book and much better than the introductory novel, BARED TO YOU.  The story stands on its own and does not try to duplicate SHADES OF GREY.<br /><br />The romance of Eva and Gideon really develops in this novel and deals with their emotional development rather than just sex.  Gideon is a multimillionaire who owns much of Manhattan, and like Eva, has also suffered sexual abuse.  They attempt to 'wrestle' with their codependency, their pasts,  their lack of trust, and the jealousy they exhibit of each other.  Only the surprise ending of this volume shows that they finally learn to love each other unconditionally.  It is worth the read.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Awesome Batman trilogy takes you to a new level with the crime fighter. Recommended for any Batman fan, Great action and a new story told.
B00846REIS|3.0|Many people like this book because it reminds them of SHADES OF GREY, Vol I.  While I see some of the same plot themes, it really seems to be only a pale imitation of Shades by making our heroine as emotionally damaged as our hero. The insecurities of both becomes wearisome.  This book, one of three, details the physical attraction and sexual encounters of Eva and Gideon - generally in some rather raw and explicit language which could be described as pornographic.  Unfortunately, the reader must slog through this book in order to fully appreciate the development of the love story which is presented in the next two books.  One thing which bothers me about these books is that  sometimes the timelines  of events, particularly as it relates to Eva's childhood, do not seem to make sense. It is like a bunch of facts have been arranged  with no pattern for example, if Eva's Mother was disowned, what happened?  Where did they live until Eva's tenth year when her sexual abuse began while living in the house with a step-brother and father?  How did her Mother meet Stanton?  When did Eva know about her real father?  These are some plot issues which should have been addressed - but describing the raw sex seemed to take precedent over the storyline.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones and the gang how can you go wrong. Good entertainment and brings together some loose ends from I & II.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|Good re-boot of the series. Although in some ways predictable.. even logical. I'm not really sure they needed three discs, but that seems to be the latest marketing ploy. Bonus information was a little limited, but if Mr. Nimoy, would happen to die before the next film at least they do contain some good interviews from him and many of the other original cast members.
B001URY5IU|4.0|Great gift for my nephew who loves Legos. He's also a big Star Wars buff and this is a great addition to his growing collection.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Serenity, hard to believe a show that was so good got shot down so fast. All I can say is thank g-d that all the actors have shown up someplace or another in the intervening years either as a star or serious guest star of several different series. Nathan Fillion, can be found on Castle. And Summer Glau, was recently on an episode of Big Bang.
0385344333|2.0|I bought this as a book on tape for a long car ride.  The story is not plausible.  I found the car ride with Agent Sorenson a joke.  A wanted man in the front seat and a trained agent asking him for help.  Oh C'mon--!<br /><br />And, I'm from the Midwest and have driven across Nebraska and Iowa hundreds of times.  I think you would be hard pressed in eastern Nebraska or western Iowa to find any straight stretch of road over 10 miles long which did not have a little town of some sort.  The idea of driving for miles and miles just would not, could not happen.  Also, roads off the Interstate, in Iowa are curvey--not straight.  The Interstate was deserted--not unless their was a flood or blizzard of which there were neither.  That just doesn't happen on that stretch of highway.  I have sat in the backseat of a car on I-80 at midnight and read as there was so much traffic that my book was illuminated by the headlights.  The geography was wrong and very poorly research.<br /><br />Will I read or listen to another?  I don't know.  Will I go to the new movie?  No, definitely not.  I might watch it on TV when it hits the small screen.<br /><br />Partmary
B009VB97EY|1.0|Absolutely no plot whatsoever. What a mindless show of naked dirty dancing. And the end of the movie was like, OK that's 2 hours just finish it happily. Don't waste you time on this. My wife didn't even like it.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Savor the movie through the limited content in this sampler, for any person who loved the movie (until the official soundtrack is released).
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I purchased this for a gift and it has been used a lot.  It protects the kindle and I would recommend it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Hard to go wrong with this one. Christopher Nolan did an excellent job on these films, despite a smidgeon of long windedness in the last film in the series. Aside from that... modern classics.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|A very good movie, even if they didn't spend a lot of time on what baseball is all about - stats. I highly reccomend.
1451695195|5.0|this book is so encouraging to anyone who has recently lost a loved one and wonders about the journey into heaven...the fact that a medical individual with farreaching experiences and education could write and relate his journey is so uplifting to those of us who have experienced a recent loss.
B008MIJFXK|5.0|I'd heard several Calexico tunes on the superb Radioparadise.com internet radio station, and REALLY liked what I heard.  As a result, I bought 'Carried to Dust'.  I am truly thankful I did.<br /><br />This album simply gets better on repeated listenings.  The sound quality is pristine, the songs are incredibly well-crafted, the lyrics poetic.<br /><br />Fantastic.  I purchased Calexico's 'Algiers' as well, and am now quickly becoming a dedicated fan.
B009CPN2G8|5.0|I am a dog lover so this movie fits and I own all the others, and it's just a good movie
B008HK3SO0|5.0|Purchased this for my nine year old son for the Holidays and he loves it! Very functional and completely protects the kindle!...great for both children and adults.
0553386794|5.0|This is not my typical genre of book, but I was hooked from the beginning.  The author did such a wonderful job developing characters and weaving several different story lines together all into one major story.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the entire story.  It was great to have an appendix with all of the characters to help me keep track.<br /><br />I can't wait to get into the second book
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was surprised how much I liked this book.  You read the hype, hear about the movies and everyone tells you, you need to read/watch this.  That's when I'm usually disappointed the most.  However, for once I was pleasantly surprised.  The book is shorter than I expected but filled with enough excitement to keep pressing the next button.  The writing is simple and easy to follow.  Not very detailed but with enough twists and turns to keep you on your proverbial mental toes.  I started this early on a Thursday and finished it Friday night.  It had a very simple device of keeping you questioning what would happen on the next chapter.  It worked, hook, line and sinker.  I'm actually looking forward to watching the movie and I'm already a third into the next book.  I can only hope that this adventure continues with the same energy, although it will be hard to reproduce.
B009VA1FN6|3.0|This was slow to start and quick to finish. Not Kate's best work. Some good concepts but not fully realised.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I have played many of these types of games...most of them crashing at some point due to the intense graphics. This game has not crashed once! It is not too difficult with help along the way if needed. Cool scenes,great graphics and smooth play....definitely worth it. Kindle Fire HD.
B00571F26Y|5.0|My  grandson who is in his third year of Med, School came home for Thanksgiving break and told me about this book. I rebelliously took a look at a sample of the book  and  Boy! Was my eyes opened I took all wheat out of my kitchen  the following week . I immediately felt energy come into my being, brain fog cleared up and I didn't have to  sleep  in  or wake up feeling tired. Plus I've lost 12 pounds with no exercise. I had seen this book in a health food store and thought another diet book and how wrong I was. I am so excited about this book I tell everyone who will listen just o try a sample. Kudos to the author of this book and his cookbook that is jut as awesome.
1938469003|5.0|This is a great read and very current review of India Pale Ales. This is a must read for any true IPA enthusiast.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|won't let me load my city. slow and worthless, it was free so at least I don't have to worry about that.
