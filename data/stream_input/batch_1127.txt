B004G600A4|4.0|After a decade of disappointing Disney films (NOT talking with Pixar) with only \\"Lilo and Stitch\\" as the only hit Disney decided to go back to tried & true.    And, did they.    It is a good film.  There is humor.  Supporting characters that we more exciting than the main characters.  That would be Maximus & Pascal.  Stole one name from \\"Gladiator\\"? We got back into regular Disney music for a film.  That is a plus, BUT which is major.  None of the songs are memorable.  I can NOT remember any of them after the film.    Is colorful.    When I wrote above about tried & true. I mean it.  You see several scenes here that were taken from both \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" & \\"Snow White.  When the film started I thought I was watching \\"Beauty and the Beast\\".  The superior film of course, \\"Snow White\\" again superior and the one that started the full length  animated films.    The good guy is first a heal, hey Disney how about I saw that in \\"The Princess and the Frog\\"?    So, it was a good try & a good film Disney.  Just NOT a bulls eye.    NOW, THE COMPLAINT I HAVE WITH DISNEY NOW.  They think EVERYONE has a blu/ray player.  I do NOT.  Can NOT afford one or the discs.  So, Disney does NOT care about regular DVD's anymore.  There is only one extra on this and it is for kids.    And, for a colorful film why a plain Jane silver disc Disney?  Cheap.  For a colorful film, beautiful animation a plain silver disc.    Cutting corners does NOT make people customers happy Disney.  Disney has gone cheap, NOT the way to make money Disney.  I hope your company AGAIN uses sales because of these cheap tricks.     Disney, you want to make money.  KEEP YOUR CUSTOMERS HAPPY.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Downloaded the app without issue, installed without issue, and played for a few days without issue. Now, the app simply will not launch. I simply get a black screen for a split second before getting returned to the home screen. The experience I and, it seems, many others are having with this app is awful.  So many widespread issues does not make me want to come back to the Amazon app store any time soon, especially to spend money. Thankfully this now useless app was free. Giving this app one star for now.  While I could play it, it was the most fun Angry Birds yet. But now that I can't any more, I'm forced to give one star until there is a fix or an alternative to this joke of an app store.
0765322889|2.0|The Gardens of the Moon is billed as the first of ten books (the last just came out so he's not pulling a Jordan), hailed for its world-creating and characters. His writing is generally crisp lively and I really wanted to like the book but ultimately I could not.    I pushed hard through the first several chapters as we're introduced to dozens of new characters, places, gods, wizards, warriors and hundreds and hundreds of new words. Ultimately this is what did me in. I would get a general grasp of what was going on only to have a bunch of new names and labels sprung on me and I'd have to either stop and look it up, stop and try to remember what it meant, or just plow on and hope I'd figure it out from context. This meant reading was either filled with unnecessary breaks (even in what should have been a fast-paced bit of action) or was like reading through a fog where I didn't know who was doing what to whom and why.    There were some good moments but ultimately that's all it had since these moments were always disrupted by Erikson's destructive urge to invent a whole new language. Any cohesion or connection was always broken leaving little islands in a fog of confusion.    Maybe someone out there will put in the effort to read and understand what is going on but really, why bother? There are hundreds of authors out there who are actually trying to help take the reader along for a ride so why pick one that seems actively hostile towards the reader?    Save your time and look elsewhere.
B004G6009U|3.0|I had been told by coworkers that this was a MUST-HAVE film. Although I cannot agree, it IS entertaining and cute but is not groundbreaking in any way. It will not blow you away. If you have kids and are the kind of person who prefers to have the DVD in their collection rather than rent them, then I can safely say, it is a good addition to a collection.<br />People have written reviews breaking down the specifics of the movie and the product description basically tells you the story so there is no need to go into those details.<br />This is a Disney return to clean, family fun. It is a real family movie. It is a well animated and well voiced film. Many movies today, even though they are animated for kids have some adult oriented humor slipped in. I don't think I saw any of this in this film. It was a kids film all the way.<br />Misrepresented DVD vs. Bluray special features: On the regular DVD, there are no special features except 50th anniversary sneak peaks. That's it. The Bluray has all the special features. I watched the Bluray + DVD edition twice and can verify this.<br />EDIT: The only thing that made the Bluray better is the witty banter in the Making of Tangled extra feature between Mandy Moore and Zach Levi. It was probably scripted but was a good, funny, entertaining behind the scenes.<br />I really didn't see a big reason for this to be in Bluray. Like any Bluray movie compared to reg. DVD, you will see a difference but it's NOT a big difference here.<br />3 -4 stars and if you are a collector of DVD's and want some good family fun, pick it up. If you aren't a big collector, rent it but it IS worth the rent/view.
159420229X|5.0|Our memory skills, just like our food cravings for fat and sugar, were better suited to our days as hunter gatherers, according to Joshua Foer in Moonwalking with Einstein.  Back then, what our ancestors needed to remember was where to find food, what plants are poisonous, and how to get home.  This makes us great at remembering visual imagery, and not so good at remembering multiple passwords, numerous phone numbers or detailed verbal instructions.<br /><br />The trick to memory techniques is changing the tedious data you want to remember into something so flamboyant and sensational that you can't forget it.  It works. With the help of images like the three Petticoat Junction sisters hula hooping in my living room I can still remember the fifteen item  \\"to do\\" list Foer's memory coach used as an example more than a week after I read that section of the book.<br /><br />Moonwalking with Einstein is part a history of mnemonic practices beginning long before the advent of writing, part a cursory introduction to some memory tricks including the memory palace, and part a chronicle of the year or so Foer spent developing his memory skills in preparation for the U.S. Memory Championship--this aspect of the book reminded me of Word Freak, a Scrabble championship account by Stefan Fatsis.  Foer also covers the phenomenon of savants, what techniques you can use to push yourself past being just okay at any given skill and how memorizing can help you be more aware and maybe even a little wiser.  Unfortunately, even after all his training Foer reports that he still sometimes misplaces his keys. This is an absorbing and entertaining book.

B004NSULHM|5.0|I got this album the day it was out.  Suprisingly, they released the album a day earlier making the experience more intense.      The album's first four tracks are filled with electronics and off-beat drum rythems.  \\"Feral\\" is complete led by electronic drum rythems anjd mysterious vocals from Thom Yorke.  \\"Lotus Flower\\" undoubtably the changing point or focus of the album.  I still think, the best tracks are \\"Morning Mr. Magpie\\" and \\"Lotus Flower.\\"  Johnny Greenwood and Ed 'O Brien were pretty conservative about playing guitar though!  There is nothing wrong about, it just makes this album a lot different from their 90's material and last album \\"In Rainbows.\\"      Thanks

This cd is great for parties or just when you feel like turnin somethin up! I'm amazed by the music Skrillex makes, I've never heard anything like it! Although it may sound like a bunch of random noises at first, it really grows on you! I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT CD TO COME OUT!
B004E2XAFW|5.0|This album is one of the best in the genera, hands down. The second track \\"Shot in the Dark\\" is my favorite so far.    The Unforgiven builds on what I expect from Within Temptation.  If you haven't seen the short movies that go with this album check them out on youTube.    Awesome narrative of the integrated story through music.  Incredibly well done overall.  I wish more music was like this - artistic, expressive, and intricate.    cheers
B003GEDLW6|5.0|I first heard \\"the island part 2\\" when my sister was listening to pandora, she made a station from that one song and it was awesome! So after a while I went ahead and bought this cd and it was soo dang awesome! It's really good for party music! every single song has an awesome bassline that makes you wanna crank it up! Most of the stuff is upbeat but there are plenty of slow parts that are totally awesome! I really dont know why your reading this review, JUST BUY IT ALREADY! =D
1439152780|5.0|I loved this book and appreciated the tremendous background in the building of characters. How each one would think, act, and how I could sense as a reader what it was like being them. Kate Morton, really draws the reader into their characters heads. This is great, big in scope, and lush in writing style with a classic feel throughout the book. This is my first book from Morton, so I look forward to reading others prior to this. WONDERFUL reading, deeply-moving, never boring, and Psychological even.........
B004SBX112|4.0|I purchased this for free so I was expected some sort of catch.  For someone who restarts a level very often if the first bird isn't perfect, you will notice a very annoying and large advertisement to get Angry birds Rio.  It is incredibly annoying and to be honest the tiny ads that were there with the free version weren't as annoying as this one.  The Bing ads are also quite annoying.  I was expecting a bit more from a 'paid' app but it was free so what can you do!
0143034901|5.0|What can I say this is big, delicous, dark, and romantic.... I read it in two weeks, loved the writing stlye and massive ending of sub-plots. It's a fabulous Novel to read!!!!! The mystery Of J. Carax and the unknown aching of his story and how it permeates throughout the Novel is a story in itself. Slightly better than The Angles Game - which was excellent >requiring a magical mind....
B004LFO0FG|2.0|Before making the investment in the album, I thought I would preview the album. Upon hearing the snippets, and some \\"sneak peeks\\" on Youtube, I'm extremely disappointed. I was a Britney Spears fan all the way up to the \\"In the Zone\\" album. To me, the albums that have followed that one all sound the same. There are a few good hit tracks worth noting on the preceding albums, but nothing worth making the investment in buying the albums as a whole. In my opinion, I think Britney has exhausted her pop avenue, and would be a bigger success if she pursued the club-diva avenue. Her target market has grown up, and sometimes that involves changing the style of music as well. Madonna did it, and Cher did it. We love hearing remixes of her at the club, so why not experiment with a club banging album? At this point, it would be worth trying, because it gets boring hearing the same recycled-bubble-gum-pop music over and over, track after track. I happen to like \\"Hold It Against Me\\", \\"Til the World Ends\\", and \\"Big Fat Bass\\" because they are upbeat and actually danceable.
0393317552|5.0|Having read the book before, I thought she would like to get stuck in as it is definitely not a 'beach read'.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|This album is just too incredible for words! The music...Sharon's amazing voice...they combine to form amazing and beautiful songs! There are songs on here for everyone! Metalheads will like it and people who like slower stuff will like it! After their amazing album \\"The Heart of Everything\\" in 2007, who could have thought they could top that? Well, I feel like they did with \\"The Unforgiving\\"! This album reached number 1 today on the US rock charts and it deserves it and I'm so proud of WT! I recommend this album to any WT lover or someone who's just getting into them! I love it!
B000M343BM|4.0|I just received the DVD last week. I've watched this movie before I bought it. It's a great sport movie with great cast. The song (Most of All by Bill Medley) is fantastic.

B004SKHJF2|5.0|Shazam does a great job of recognizing tunes. Even Hindi and Kannada tunes (languages spoken in India). Soundhound could recognize only the English tunes. I highly recommend this app
B000002MJC|5.0|While many dismiss this album for being a \\"sell-out,\\" album, I would strongly encourage those people to take a look at the lyrics, and just listen. In particular, I would recommend the songs, \\"Condemnation,\\" \\"Mercy In You,\\" \\"Judas,\\" and \\"Get Right With Me,\\"  which have affected me on such a deep level, I would go as far as to say that they have changed me as a person. The dark themes are matched only by the dark growling sound of the album, and yet, there is a tinge of inspiration and hope in the harmonies and reversed piano outro's that instill such feelings.     \\"I Feel You,\\" and \\"Higher Love,\\" quickly crawled to the top of my sex playlist, being some of the most sensual DM songs (only upstaged by the sensuality shown throughout their effort \\"Exciter,\\").     I would encourage everyone to buy this album, DM lover or not, and just listen to the lyrics, then listen to them again, then again, then analyze what they're saying, and I mean what they're REALLY saying about humanity. It's truly something. Martin Gore, Alan Wilder, Fletch, thank you for this album a thousand times over.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I've taken this watch with me on two runs so far, and it will definately be a part of my runs from now on.  I mainly use the watch for analyzing my runs afterwards.  I like the ability to watch my heart rate and chart my runs/distances.  I live in an area with tall building and I am still able to get GPS reception, which was my primary concern before purchasing.  Although it takes some time to initially get a GPS lock, afterwards it keeps tracking consistently during my entire workout.<br />The touch bezel isn't my favorite thing, but I don't mess with the watch while I'm running, only before and after, so I don't find it to be difficult to work with, although if I were a designer, I would tend to prefer buttons over touch technology, not a big deal for me at all though.  The touch does work fine and I have no issues with the functionality of it, but can't comment on the sweat and touch bezel interference part.<br />Heart rate monitor is flawless.<br />My only gripe about the entire system is Garmin's lack of including the software with the watch.  They only include a CD version of the owner's manual.  You have to download the software (free) from their website.  Not a big deal, but could have saved the 100+ MB of download by just including it on the CD with the owner's manual.<br />ANT+ technology works great too.  It automatically syncs from the watch to the computer.  I think you are also able to sync stuff from the computer to the watch, but haven't gotten that far with it yet.<br />Overall, I think this is a great tool for running.  I like the ability to plan my routes and save them on my computer to track my run times, heart rate and pace to see if I'm improving, and where I need to improve.<br /><br />UPDATE: 4/4/13 (Two years, or so, later).  This watch still continues to be my regular go-to running device.  I've now logged over 850 miles running and 440 miles cycling.  Taken it all over the world with me and locates, tracks, and monitors my runs flawlessly.I only use it to run, not as an everyday watch, and still in perfect condition.  No battery degradation, no flaws EVER.  Only changed the battery on the heart rate monitor once (just recently).
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|The Tourist is the 2010 English-language debut from director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who previously directed the highly acclaimed German film [[ASIN:B000OVLBGC The Lives of Others]]. Sporting a cast lead by two of the biggest movie stars in the world, the movie opened to mostly negative reviews and mixed audience reaction. After seeing this movie twice, I think the negativity is somewhat misguided. It's not a great movie, simply a fun piece of mindless entertainment that never takes itself too seriously. Apparently, this movie's light-heartedness and mindlessness is lost on audiences who think every film is meant to be taken seriously unless there's an explosion every few minutes.    Angelina Jolie plays Elise Clifton-Ward, a beautiful woman being followed by the police in Paris as they attempt to apprehend Alexander Pearce, her former lover. Pearce stole two billion dollars from a gangster named Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff) and is wanted by Shaw for this transgression and by the authorities for tax evasion. Elise receives a letter from Alexander that directs her to board a train to Venice and find someone of his height and build to mislead the police. Obliging him, she boards the train and meets Frank (Johnny Depp), an everyman schoolteacher. While the police quickly realize that Frank is not Pearce, mistaken identity puts Shaw on Frank's trail. The movie co-stars Paul Bettany as the lead investigator of the case Inspector John Acheson and former James Bond star Timothy Dalton as Chief Inspector Jones.    While I too have found flaws, there are several things The Tourist does right. Shot in Venice, the locale is beautiful and cinematographer John Seale gives the film a beautiful, elegant look. Of course, discussing this movie and elegance it would be a sin not to mention Jolie who all but seethes elegance the moment she enters the frame. Jolie's performance as Elise has been accused of being \\"stiff,\\" which is a criticism I highly disagree with. This isnot a role that requires her to conjure up great emotional depth. Elise is a glamorous, mysterious woman and Jolie captures that perfectly. While Jolie looks like the glamorous movie star she is, Depp is rugged enough to be convincing as the empathetic everyman and he basically steals every scene he's in. Depp is a quirky, inventive actor who can usually find an interesting character attribute to toy with. As Frank, he's playing a wholly average man who is immediately in awe of Elise and the situation she's dragged him into. Depp is clearly having fun with this role and the way he tackles it makes it immediately fun to watch. His everyman shtick is not without a unique charm that only Depp could provide. His one-word reaction to seeing Jolie at the hotel for example is priceless.    Criticism has also been aimed at the perceived lack of chemistry between Depp and Jolie. How is it possible that two of Hollywood's biggest movie stars could not have chemistry together? Well, I found that they DO but it's not Bogart/Bacall-type chemistry but more of a stilted, awkward one. This is entirely appropriate as Frank is in awe of the fact that a woman like Elise would even talk to him. Towards the end of the film, the two transcend that initial awkwardness and develop a convincing romantic dynamic. It's a cute chemistry that Depp and Jolie share, just not one for the history books.    The Tourist was marketed as an action-comedy and has elements of both, but is more of a throwback to films that give plot a backseat to beautiful movie stars and a beautiful locale. Von Donnersmarck is an acclaimed director whose last film was a pretty heavy drama and it seems obvious that this film was an excuse to go to a beautiful place and have fun. It's obvious that the actors involved had the same intentions. This is not a movie that's meant to be taken seriously and if you watch this movie under the impression that it's Oscar-bait, then a lot of elements would seem poorly executed. If it'snot apparent from Depp's performance alone that this is just a fun, light-hearted romp then you need to watch more movies. Even the action/chase/Depp-in-peril sequences are fun and light-hearted, without being too heavy on the suspense.    With all of that in mind, even as the light-hearted romp it is, there are both mild criticisms and serious flaws present in The Tourist. For a film with beautiful cinematography and production design, the score by James Newton Howard, while not bad by any means, is rather typical of a European espionage film. The music just lingers listlessly in the background, rarely making itself noticeable. The biggest flaw here is the final twist; a twist so forced and contrived that it insults the film that came before it and fails on no less than two levels. The first is that it is completely devoid of logic, it makes no sense, and it betrays nearly all the characterization that came before it. If you watch the film aware of the twist, you realize that a particular character is either incredibly stupid, forgetful, or just blissfully unaware of the twist that directly involves him. Few movies have an ending that seem more tacked on than this one. Even worse, the script is co-written by Christopher McQuarrie, the Oscar-winning scribe behind The Usual Suspects. The twist at the end is already unoriginal and something that we've seen many times before but the fact that McQuarrie, in a shameless act of self-plagiarism, was responsible for writing it simply adds insult to injury. This is obviously a major problem, but beyond that I have little to gripe about.    The Tourist is light entertainment that aspires to be nothing more than that. I think everyone involved succeeded at making the film they intended to make and, for what it's worth, they did a commendable job. If not for the twist that insults both the film and the people watching it, it could be much better. There is nothing particularly memorable or fresh about this movie, but it is muchmore breezy and enjoyable than the critics would have you believe. If you're in a mood where you feel the film Knight & Day will be too taxing on your mental energy, The Tourist is exactly the breezy entertainment you're looking for.    GRADE: B-
0316010669|4.0|I was assigned this book for my AP Econ class and was worried that it was going to be like an English summer reading assignment, where you dreaded picking up the book and beginning. But as I started the book, I could not put it down. Even while I was on vacation, I still had it in hand reading. Blink discusses the reasons why we do the things we do and it was very interesting. The writing was entertaining and easy to understand. Some may be skeptical about a book dealing with the economy, but this book deals with the pyschology behind it all. I recommend this book to anyone.

The story builds to the point of climax, and then ebbs back down as we switch to the next point of view. There are certain characters that I really enjoy reading about such as Jon, Arya, Bran, and Tyrion. The other characters aren't quite as interesting to me, but they do advance the story.<br /><br />Another aspect of the story I like is the grittiness of the characters. There doesn't seem to be a clearly defined good versus evil although there is a lot of talk about honor and doing one's duty. There are some truly evil characters that I loathe, and I eagerly look forward to them meeting justice for their despicable actions.<br /><br />The book hints at magic use, but only features it a couple times. There are some hints of what I would call mysticism with references to older times when magic abounded, and the ability to peer into the future/sense things going on in other parts of the realm. I also got the sense that there might be some magic left in the world, and it may come out more in later stories.<br /><br />As a word of warning, the book includes some graphic, violent scenes in the form of war, executions, and sword fighting. There are also several sex scenes, but they are not overly graphic or drawn out.enes, but they are not overly graphic or drawn out.

B004EC5IV6|5.0|This is one of the few anime shows I enjoyed watching when I was younger.  When I heard about the remake I had to pick it up.  The first one was hard to find at a decent price so when I saw that this one was pre-ordering for such a great price I couldn't resist.  It was waiting for me when I got home yesterday.  I love that the remake is going in new directions.  I do have to say one negative is that I wish there was less cut out from the original series, but it's almost like wishing more of book is in a movie remake.  The graphics are fantastic and the music is great.  Just wish it wasn't two years in between each installment :(
B0012GMX2Y|4.0|Gentle Giant are, of their own admission, an acquired taste.  THREE FRIENDS, their third outing pushed back the barriers when released in 1972    Many of today's leading 'prog metal' bands recognize their influence and Spocks Beard have even emulated their vocal styling.    THREE FRIENDS is a concept album that doesn't lose its' way or get bogged down with overly long tracks which meander.  In a word it works and still stands up almost 40 years on.  These guys were quality musicians who sadly lost their way in the mid-seventies and remained a 'cult' band.    The album itself is short by today's standards put packed from start to finish with amusingly clever lyrics and great playing.  An attempt to disect each track would be a fruitless exercise, suffice to say that if you have never listened to GG then you ain't heard nothing quite like them.  This album along with OCTOPUS probably rate among their best efforts and are a great starting point for those not acquanted with GG.    Open your mind, ears and hearts and have a listening experience second-to-none.
B000K7UG34|5.0|This is a minor comment - judge as you wish -it is relevant for accuracy.    A missing hero is Rick Rescorla, the subject of a wonderful book by James Stewart, \\"Heart of a Soldier\\".  Book plug - don't just watch the movie - Rescorla is (rightfully) on the cover of \\"We were soldiers, once and young\\".    The movie deleted Rescorla, combined him with Hal Moore (Stewart explains).    Aside from minor flaws, this movie has a lot reality in it.  Buy it to gain a sliver of understanding for the complexity of V-N that few truly understand, even now.  But it was a tragedy for many warriors who fought and served.   In watching the movie, I once again felt profound sadness for those who perished ... for not much gained ... even though all were committed.  In the end we fought only for each other.  FYI 2/7 wasn't my outfit.

B003UESJEM|5.0|\\"The Company Men\\" is a sober telling of life within a modern company.  Men come to be defined by their jobs and when the job is taken away from them, they are lost.  Their world as they understand it simply collapses.<br /><br />At a high level, \\"The Company Men\\" covers the lives of several executives of the ship building division of GTX Corporation, an American conglomerate.  Profitability and growth seems to be eluding the division and the only response of management is downsizing and, when this fails, more downsizing.  Each man is thrown into a whirlpool.  Their lives of debt and over-consumption come to a screeching halt.  If there is one message from this film it is that too many people assume that things won't change.  Too little attention is paid to saving for a rainy day.  Consumption is king.<br /><br />There are excellent performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Ben Affleck.  Both end up being \\"let go\\" and both struggle with the consequences.  However, eventually, reality must be faced.  This is not an easy row to hoe.  In the case of Ben Affleck's character, his life style is forced to undergo big changes.  His house is sold, his family moves back to living with his parents, his wife gets a part time job and he takes a job of manual labour from his brother in law.<br /><br />Without spoiling the plot, there is a somewhat happier ending.  However, in the meantime, the film gives an excellent portrayal of so much of modern corporate life.  It's a dog eat dog world out there.  Just remember that change can be forced on anyone.

She has none, for she now has a mission: to read voraciously, perceptively and on occasion contemptuously the novels she has had no time to dip into during her sixty years on the throne.  The Queen has a new voice, that of Alan Bennett, the sly narrator who guides the reader through Her Majesty's choice of authors, from Lauren Bacall to Alice Monroe from Jean Genet to Marcel Proust.<br /><br />Her Majesty has ever been a dutiful slave to the requirements of her office, but this noble trait is put in jeopardy by her latest obsession.  There are so many distractions, such as barking dogs, irate equerries, warring ministers and boring soirees.  Then she is obliged to make trips to Canada, the States, Norfolk, and Scotland - but never without a volume:<br />Balzac, Turgenev, Fielding, Conrad, books which once she would have thought beyond her but which now she sailed through, pencil always in hand, and in the processs, incidentally, becoming reconciled even to Henry James, whose divagations she now took in her stride.<br /><br />On her eightieth birthday she gives a tea party for her Privy Councillors.  Always in command of her sometimes restive audience she gives a long speech, at the start of which the prime minister suggests that the esteemed guests sing `Happy Birthday!'<br /><br />`Don't let's get carried away,' said Her Majesty. `Though it is true that one is eighty and this is a sort of birthday party.  But quite what there is to celebrate I'm not sure.  But I suppose one of the few things to be said for it is that one has at least achieved an age at which one can die without people being shocked  There was polite laughter at this and the Queen herself smiled. `I think,' she said, that more shouts of `No, No' might be appropriate.'  So somebody obliged and there was more complacent laughter as the nation's most distinguished tasted the joys of being teased by the nation's most eminent.<br /><br />All tremendous fun and never a dull moment in this slight but witty book narrated by the urbane Alan Bennett.emendous fun and never a dull moment in this slight but witty book narrated by the urbane Alan Bennett.

B004E2XAFW|5.0|One thing I have noticed about Within Temptation is that they are constantly reinventing their sound. \\"Mother Earth\\" sounded nothing like \\"Enter.\\" The changes between \\"Mother Earth,\\" \\"Silent Force\\" and \\"Heart of Everything\\" were a bit more subtle, but still noticeably there.     With \\"The Unforgiving,\\" Within Temptation totally reinvents their sound again. This is not a bad thing...at...all. \\"The Unforgiving\\" takes Within Temptation to a whole new level of dark, tumultuous emotions and imagery. And it's not like their previous albums were all that light hearted! Yet as dark as the music gets, they still give a glimmer of hope at the end, giving the album a much-needed upper ending.    Also, if you're already a Within Temptation fan, don't hesitate to get the Special Edition CD+DVD version. The short films are very nice and moody (maybe too intense and bloody for kids, parents beware). The music videos are also very nice. It makes for a really solid package.     This album gets an easy five stars from me. Within Temptation has really matured in their composition. The songs are an easy five stars. The added DVD with its short films and music videos is an easy five stars. The cover art, fold out cover lyric book and the presentation of the package as a whole is another easy five stars.

B0002KQNL8|2.0|Film Review:    Following up on the plot of the original ROTLD, yet another barrel of nerve gas is dumped upon a cemetary, unleashing the living dead to feast on human brains!  The objectionable content is toned down significantly for this entry, making it more of a fun comic book movie than the much more vulgar and terrifying film which came before it.    When I first saw ROTLD2 I couldn't decide right away if it was supposed to be a literal sequel, or a reboot of some sort.  First of all, the ending of the original film seemed to suggest the total extinction of the world, seeing as the nuclear blast caused the gas and acid rain to spread across the country.  Second of all, two of the leads from the original make appearances in Part 2 as similar characters, reciting similar lines, and even commenting that \\"It's like we've been here before...\\"  The biggest clue to this being an actual sequel is one scene where a character spots a bottle of nerve gas and comments \\"not again...\\", although I suppose that line could also be referring to the original VA Hospital outbreak where the gas was created.  Leaving the question ambiguous is probably the best bet, I guess.    Not nearly as good as the original, ROTLD2 still sports some awesome 80's rock tracks, lots of laughs, and of course, brain-eating zombies!  It could be considered an alternative film for those who can't quite stomach the horrific gore, language, and nudity first one.    DVD Review:    I'm glad I only paid $4.99 for this at FYE, because it is probably the lousiest DVD transfer I've seen thusfar.  For some reason the entire soundtrack has been repalced with some generic jingle, instead of the cool music that made this a Nostalgiac purchase to begin with.  I still own a true copy of this movie on VHS, but not a VCR!  I find it difficult to believe that they couldn't find a single decent copy of the original soundtrack to master on DVD, because the original VHS copy with full soundtrack was still in print only ten years ago.  Plus, they were able to get the French language track right.  Honestly, I had to watch the movie in french with English subtitles because the new music was so distracting.    I'd hate to give this two stars, because it is a classic horror film from the era where zombie movies weren't drastically overdone, but even the tagline on the front cover which used to be \\"Got An Appetite For Horror?  This is Your Dish.\\" (a cool and clever line, in my opinion) is now replaced with \\"Just When You Thought It Was Safe To Be Dead\\", which is not only lame, but doesn't make any sense at all.    Hopefully somebody will decide to re-release this, because it's a shame to dump such a classic movie into the garbage like that.  Maybe us fans can hold out some type of hope for the Blu-Ray release...

B002ZG98UK|4.0|I see that this title gets a lot of crap for being a re-hashed \\"who cares?\\" plot, featuring cardboard acting of yawn-provoking characters polished over with 3D special effects.   ....True, but keep in mind, this IS an adaptation of a video game.  Speaking as a long-time fan of the Resident Evil game series, I can certainly say that even though Afterlife may be arguably the weakest of the series, it's still packed with a lot of fun!    If you've played Resident Evil 5, you'll recognize a lot of nods to the game, including fairly faithful adaptations of the \\"Majini\\" zombies, the ruthless Undertaker, and a pretty damn good interpretation of Albert Wesker in his final appearance.  (Spoiler: I'm glad they didn't try to do Wesker's \\"final\\" final appearancein RE5; you know, the one where he melds his arm with a peice of twisted metal and chases you around a volcano?\\")  And if you were one of the people who has had enough of Alice and her superhuman clones, relax, because it seems like they responded to all of the negative feedback in the first ten minutes of the movie, in which they not only rid Alice of her T-Virus powers, but also kill all of the clones in one shot.  She's still the main character, but believe it or not, takes a backseat in the final battle, which features predominantly Chris and Claire Redfield, in yet another decently-adapted moment from RE5.    As far as the 3D goes, I have to say I was pretty impressed.  Among the recent surge of 3D in theaters, this was one of the few that was actually filmed in 3D, rather than being converted in post production, so it works.    Overall, it's a fun movie that you don't have to invest too many brain cells in, and don't have to worry in the least about being scared witless afterward.  These movies are basically like playing the video games without doing any of the work, so if you've had a rough day, they're a great way to unwind.

0060936223|5.0|I was stunned when I heard that Patti Smith memoir had won the National Book Award. But I was curious, and bought it. Having read it, I concur wholeheartedly with the honor.    This book is many things. Smith captures a time and place--the art scene in 1960s and '70s New York--in a way that made it completely real to me. From the time she arrived, broke, hungry and homeless, through the time she launched her music career, she weaves her tales of fascinating people (many legendary characters here) with the sounds, smells, scenery and esthetics of that amazing time. She doesn't sugarcoat anything. I could have read this straight through, but found myself taking breaks to cruise the internet to \\"visit\\" the places, people and artwork that Smith describes.    The heart of the book is Smith's portrait of Robert Mapplethorpe, her one-time lover. Their's was a love story that transcended mere romance. Smith and Mapplethorpe were artistic partners, each a muse to the other. Their love and respect for each other lasted long after they ceased to be lovers, and ended only with Mapplethorpe's 1989 death.    Read this book. It is lovely, inspirational and devastating.

Some of the creations are useful for building a whole city out of Legos. Even though I don't have all the Legos, I can substitute certain ones (although some I can't)-- For example, I need some treads. Compared to doing Star Wars Legos, these creations can help you build a tank or a plane. Unfortunately, Star Wars Legos doesn't show you how to build stuff like a tank with treads. Some stuff you'd have to come up with yourself. I give it 5 stars.\\"<br /><br />His initial reaction to the book was that he doesn't have the right pieces. I could hear strains of \\"Mom, I need more Legos\\" coming. But after looking through the Lego examples and designs longer, he changed his tune. :) I like that this book helps develop their imagination outside of the standard, premade Lego collections.

0385340567|3.0|Lee Child books, like many thrillers involving a repeating main character, are pure escapism.  Any hold to reality is tenuous and the reader must suspend credibility in order to be carried along with the plot.    I'd heard good things about this book and decided that taking it out for free at my local library was probably a good idea.  I'd read a previous book by this author (I don't remember which one), and found it pretty entertaining.  This one, unfortunately, was less so.    The story was just so cliché that it was nearly impossible to become engaged.  There are two small towns next to one another in the middle of nowhere: Hope and Despair.  Can you guess what types of people inhabit each town?  Can you imagine that something sinister is going on in Despair that our hero, Jack Reacher, must investigate?  Can you predict that someone in Hope will help him get to the bottom of the problems in Despair?    If so, you don't need to read the book.  If you're still interested in the story, get it the way I did - for free at your local library.  You'll end up getting what you paid for.
B001EIOOV8|1.0|I will keep this short. If you can't handle the f**k word every 3 minutes then don't buy this. I was amazed at how many times the word was used. It's not a family movie or for anyone in my opinion. The actual movie was okay but i could not handle the language. I grew up in the 60's & that particular word had started to be used in that era not in the 30's, 40's, or 50's. I gave it 1 star & advise anyone from buying this movie. The filth of the language destroys all that the movie creators tried to create....or not create!!!!
0756404738|4.0|Had this been Patrick Rothfuss' debut novel I probably would have been more favorable with my final rating.  However, when one compares it to The Name of the Wind it falls a little flat.  Kvothe is a very engaging and likeable character.  The world Patrick has developed is tangible, although not unique, and his combination of didactic learning and implied magic has much promise.  Patrick has also created a story arc that is potentially epic in scope, drawing on 'classic' mythology, creatures of the fae, and 'modern' science.  How Kvothe fits into his immediate surroundings is very engaging and exciting.  How Kvothe can and will fit into the larger scheme of things will hopefully be just as impressive.      Where Patrick is running into trouble is his ability to continue to develop Kvothe.  Kvothe is the ultimate renaissance man for this fictional world. He is incredibly gifted, remarkably bright, and has a magnetic peronality.  As an author, however, it is extremely difficult to write this type of character.  And the reason is simple.  The author is not as mentally gifted as Kvothe.  Now I do not mean that as a slight to Mr. Rothfuss.  He is obviously bright, has a tremendous sense of humor, and is in possession of a multi-faceted education.  But Kvothe is a genius, and it is very difficult to write and conceive of scenarios and conundrums that would enmesh a genius. It is harder still to conceive and describe a genius' solution to those conundrums!  What we are left with is a written character with a pile of unrealized potential who may not be able to receive the life he deserves.  What we should have seen in this book is the maturation of Kvothe, a development of his powers (both mental and magical), and a character arc that would at least hint at the man Kvothe is going to be.  What we received was more of the same--a teenager with potential.  Fortunately more of the same Kvothe is tremendous material.  Hopefully in the next installment Patrick Rothfuss can drivehis loveable and compelling character into the mental and psychological demesne the character deserves.

0061726826|5.0|This book was fantastic! Lauren Oliver is a master of the \\"action scene\\". The whole book, but particularly the end, was like watching an action movie. Her world was incredibly well defined and it was easy to feel a part of it very early on in the book. My heart broke for Lena multiple times throughout the book, she was really a character that you \\"got to know\\" (and love) and I felt SO proud of her when the book was over.    And the ending was amazing, it WAS a cliffhanger (which is something I have issues with, lol) but it was a really well-designed cliffhanger that in some ways made the book feel like a standalone. Besides the final scenes of the book shorted out my brain so I couldn't really even focus on the cliffhanger part of it! :)    This is DEFINITELY a series I will waiting on pins and needles for!
B003Y7AR7C|5.0|Our household got \\"hooked up\\" on the nutcracker this winter so we own a bunch of other recordings.   Barishnikov which is great but a TV production, not live performance.  Nureyev - disturbing.  Bolshoi (with Maximova from the late 70's). Great dancing, terrible orchestra.    This is my favorite. The dancing is nothing short of superb. The production is a joy to the eyes and the orchestra is a joy to my ears.    Highly recommended!
B000EBEHR2|3.0|Pretty much the only Placebo CD I wish I never bought, strange as it may seem to even say it. I knew they had been going that direction in sound for a while now, but I personally never got into like everything else from their works over the past couple decades. It just felt more of a harder kicking beatbox behind their sound, and for me, that just wasn't cutting it. Had it been the only Placebo CD on earth, I'd learn to make do, but not so for the enjoyment.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|You know when you crave something really badly, wait for it in anticipation, and once you savour it it tastes so much better than you imagined it would?!    That is exactly how this book was! After reading \\"House Rules\\" I have been waiting for the next Picoult book...    I think this Jodi Picoult book has been given harsh criticism because of the subject matter, rather than its writing style and plot...    Jodi Picoult dives into topics of homosexuality, gay rights, in-vetro fertilization and religion, and as always, does not disappoint.  She dives in where other writers would be scared to venture... and once there, she doesn't leave a single issue/topic unturned.      A good book leaves you wanting to read on.  A good book stays with you even after it is done.  This was one such book.  In typical Picoult style, you get fantastic characters: each has a story and each gets a voice in the book.  Opposing views come together and merge into a deep plot with twists and turns, resulting in a fast paced courtroom conclusion.      Now I wait for the next one...
B00006BTCA|5.0|Totally got this album after only knowing one track off it, and previously enjoying their self-titled release and haven't exactly looked back.

B000002B2T|5.0|Caught myself buying this CD multiple times because of its greatness. That, and I needed to replace the copy BEFORE it. Great, older stuff that still lives and defeats mosts sounds of today. Strangely enough, it's also dynamic, which is great when it happens to be that only cd laying around you at the time. Truely, its hard NOT to enjoy this CD. And for all I know, I probably need to get it again.

B004SC54BG|4.0|This is more or less tailored toward those worrying about the apparent new direction for the band.  Let's just say that the whole comic book thing (and hearing about the strong 80s overtones) had me worried to say the least.  I thought, \\"Wow, WT, what are you doing?  A COMIC BOOK?!  QUASI-SYMPHONIC DISCO METAL?!\\"  I even checked out some of the actual comic book, and thought it was incredibly cheesy.    So, I'm happy to say that the album itself didn't disappoint.  I wouldn't go so far as to call it \\"pop rock\\", because WT's old sound is in there still - it's just taken a back seat to allow a new element to take the spotlight.  The most noticeable thing about these songs is the beat, which is something that's gone relatively unnoticed in the shine of the symphonic element in previous albums.  There is a strong, driving beat in most of The Unforgiving's songs.  Having listened to the album a few times now, I can definitely hear the 80s overtone at times, but it isn't anywhere near the disaster I expected.  I have honestly never wondered what the fusion of 80s music and symphonic metal would sound like, but WT seems to have pulled it off.  \\"80s overtones\\" doesn't mean \\"Sharon felt like covering Journey songs.\\"  Suffice it to say I still recognize WT in this album, and having a more commercial sound didn't ruin it in my opinion.    I won't bother with a song-by-song review because there are plenty here that have already covered that, but I will say that Sinead (don't know how to do the fancy e) is my favorite, and showcases the overall sound very well.  Not every song is quite there for me (Middle of the Night, for example - the balance between the melody and the beat was off in this one, and the result was an overbearing, hammering beat with a bland melody), but overall the album is solid.  The relatively slower songs are very nicely done and provide a good balance to the intensity of the rest of the album.    So, thank you, WT.

B004MC0FO8|4.0|Like many people, I enjoy music.  Often, I can identify a song with just a snippet of lyrics and a guess as to who the artist may be.  Sometimes, though, I hear something I really like and just have no idea who the artist is.  That's where Shazam is handy.  Fire it up, let it listen to a few seconds of the song, and it will often come back and tell you the artist, song title, and album.<br /><br />Do I use it daily?  No.  Weekly?  Probably not.  But when I need it, it's there and it works.  It does everything I need it to do.
B004QYZATW|4.0|Like all men, \\"lucky-enough\\" to kiss a beautiful woman, we never \\"regret\\" it at first. It isn't until you understand that \\"beauty is only skin deep\\" (if you're lucky) that it may dawn on you, beauty IS, indeed, only at the top. Once you discover, Serial Killers are often \\"easy on the eyes,\\" that you begin to understand what \\"true beauty\\" is really all about. You cannot \\"judge a book, by it's cover.\\" So you cannot tell a Serial-killer by looking at them. Therefore, you could-be kissing a Serial-Killer, and not find out, until it's too late. As I myself once did. i.e. \\"The Christmas Queen Killer.\\" Angelina is showing her milage, AND her age.
0596809158|5.0|I'd give this book ten stars if I could.  I bought one copy for the office and one for my house.  This guy has the ability to write simply and with the mind set of people who are busy and want to get results right away.  Of course we'd all love to be leisurely scholars and plow through theory and practice but most of us just need to get things done.  A good example is the way he treats ARIMA.  He warns you about using auto.arima but does not hide it from you because it is \\"dangerous.\\"  The book is full of tips, well organized and is oriented towards beginners, though it gets into depth.  So many of the R books I've read absolutely pound you with up front details, some of which relate to obscure concerns,  rather than starting with a task.  For example, on page 199 he writes \\"Problem -- you want to count the relative frequency of certain observations in your sample\\"  Next is \\"Solution\\" -- and he explains just the minimum needed to do that job.  Some of the tips are just simple time savers, such as the function head(dataframe) to show a few of the dataframe rows at the start and tail(dataframe) to show a few at the end.  Finally .... I don't know this writer personally, but I hope he keeps on writing because it is a craft he has thoroughly absorbed somewhere along the line.  Bill Yarberry,  Houston, TX

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love youversion. I wish I could express it better, but that's the bottom line! It has really helped me stay on target with my daily reading plan. I have been reading 84 days now!! I love the ease of use, the ability to tag scriptures and to make notes that I can either share with others or keep private. I love reading other folks notes and thinking about what they say and seeing how it fits with what I understand - or not. It is a big group effort to stay faithful, read and share. Hands down the best reading experience I have had for some time. I am using the Chronological version but if that isn't your cup of tea there are so many reading plans to choose from. I read on my mac but I can also read on my phone if I am away from home and there are many languages available. Highly recommend.

0800177177|4.0|Released at Christmas time 1992, Francis Ford Coppola's version of the oft-filmed tale was moderately successful at the US box office, costing $40 million and bringing in $82 million; it earned an additional $133 million worldwide for a total of $216 million. These are good figures for back then.<br /><br />POSITIVES:<br /><br />- This is easily the most stylistic and visually opulent film version of Dracula.<br /><br />- The first 88 minutes, up to Lucy's vampiric resurrection, are great.<br /><br />- I've always thought one of the best parts of the original novel was the beginning where Jonathan Harker goes to Transylvania to visit the Count at his castle and the ensuing horror. This entire sequence is done very well in Coppola's version.<br /><br />- Harker's run-in with Drac's three brides is outstanding. Monica Belucci appears as one of the three ravishing-yet-diabolic brides; she was one of the most beautiful women in the world (and probably still is).<br /><br />- Another great scene is the surreal sequence in Lucy's lavish gardens where she's seduced by Dracula in man-wolf form, spied by Mina.<br /><br />- Lucy's vampiric resurrection in the tomb is also horrifying and well-done, albeit not scary.<br /><br />- Drac's supernatural aspects are played up here more than any other version of the tale (up to that point); he appears as an old man, a younger man, a wolf, a man-wolf, a bunch of rats, a green mist, and a man-bat creature.<br /><br />- Sadie Frost puts her whole heart into the role of Lucy and is excellent. Winona Ryder is also effective as the meek Mina.<br /><br />- Not to mention Anthony Hopkins makes the best Van Helsing with his determined, hardy spunk.<br /><br />- The score by Wojciech Kilar is fitting and memorable.<br /><br />- Writer James V. Hart gets creative and adds an interesting twist to the done-to-death yarn. I'm referring to Drac's love for Mina, who's evidently his wife reincarnated. This new element helps keep the story interesting for those who may be bored with the oft-told tale.<br /><br />- The ultimate message of the film is great: Love conquers all and the light of God's presence brings redemption to those whose hearts still blip with a glimmer of hope, faith and love, no matter how mired in total darkness. Freedom & forgiveness are there IF you want it.<br /><br />NEGATIVES:<br /><br />- Despite the title, this is not a faithful version of Stoker's book. The difference is that the Dracula in Coppola & Hart's version is not a paragon of unadulterated evil, as in Stoker's novel, but rather a sympathetic vampire with a serious case of love-sickness. Needless to say, this takes the bite out of the Count's wicked exploits as it's nigh impossible for the viewer to be horrified by a character with whom s/he sympathizes.<br /><br />- Gary Oldman, who plays Dracula, does a great John Lennon impersonation.<br /><br />- The film is entertaining and successfully creates a horror atmosphere, but I never found it scary, like - say - the 2004 remake of &#34;Dawn of the Dead&#34; or &#34;The Exorcism of Emily Rose.&#34; (This isn't really a negative to me since I don't really WANT to be scared; I want to sleep at night!)<br /><br />- The fact that Dracula appears in so many supernatural forms can be confusing on one's initial viewing, unless of course you're well-versed with the book; consequently, the viewer may have a hard time comprehending or even identifying the title character (Is he an old man, a younger man, a wolf, a bunch of rats, a werewolf, a mist, a man-bat or what?!).<br /><br />- The last act, which comprises the final 33 minutes (not including credits), loses the captivating appeal of the first 88 minutes. Up to this point Coppola & Hart obviously took their time with the characters and their story and it worked. The final act, however, seems like they rushed to tie everything up by the 2-hour mark. Don't get me wrong, the last act isn't bad and it has some quality action, but it's just not as good as the first two acts; it's a little confusing and the film suffers for it.<br /><br />- The final act contains two love scenes between Drac & Mina that are difficult to watch. I just get sick to my stomach viewing these sequences where Mina gets intimate with this nasty fiend (not sexually), particularly the scene in the chapel where Drac looks like a hellish man-bat. But, then again, I like the message: Genuine love & loyalty transcend personal failings and distasteful aspects, like a wife who still loves her husband even though she sees him floss his green teeth and washes his soiled underwear (lol).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Coppola & Hart's version is colorfully lavish and adds an interesting love story to Stoker's tale with potent spiritual significance. This will, of course, turn-off purists who prefer the totally malevolent king of vampires of the original novel, which is what disenchanted me the first time I saw it, but who can blame Coppola & Hart for wanting to try something new with the well-worn yarn? Despite a fairly weak final act and a cobbled-together vibe, they largely succeed.<br /><br />Although losing points for the negatives listed above, I have to admit that this is probably my favorite version of the tale, which says a lot.<br /><br />Amazingly, the film was shot completely on studio sets, but doesn't seem like it. It runs 127 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: Bt not as good as the first two acts; it's a little confusing and the film suffers for it.<br /><br />- The final act contains two love scenes between Drac & Mina that are difficult to watch.

B0034G4ORM|1.0|Come one, come all, to the cinematic spectacle event of 2011!!<br /><br />See a beautiful and completely original plot be deftly handled in the best possible way!!! See a bunch of cliches presented on screen in a completely glorious fashion!!! Savour all the pointless running, jumping, sacrificing and faith leaping throughout!!!<br /><br />Watch the only likable character, a doctor-to-be, be reduced to being the token black guy!!! Watch how typical the characters are- big \\"Marines don't quit dammit\\" leader! Token virgin! Token gun-toting idiot! Token badass chick! Token crude joke cracker!!!<br /><br />This film is so patriotic that non-Americans will LOVE the thrusting of red white and blue in their faces!!! In fact, they'll love it so much they'll buy an American flag right after!!!! (On a serious note, I saw this while vacation in London. A Canadian in crowd of Brits, I had to nod my head in agreement when I heard one say on the way out, \\"For some reason I feel proud to be American... and I'm not even American\\". It even sounded funny with the accent)<br /><br />Also, be wowed at the triumph of style over substance!!! Try to comprehend what's going on in the action scenes!!! Be confused, nauseous and baffled at shaky camera and fast edits!! Get tired from the film's not knowing when to shut the hell up!!!<br /><br />You will especially be excited for the upcoming sequel, Battle: London, where the army have to convince the population of London, having turned uncontrollably cannibalistic, not to eat each other!!! Will they succeed? Well you'll just have to find out, but in the meantime, Witness Battle: Los Angeles!!!<br /><br />...or better yet, don't. Just a few days ago I re-watched District 9. At least that film has characters and situations you can care for.

1416583432|4.0|Why do they do what they do?  I think of this book as almost a text book that should inspire us to go deeper into the mind of our dog and read them better and allow them to read and react to us better.  It has been pointed out that this book is kind of thin on test results and serious clinical substance but it does have plenty of dicussions on things I did not know about the dog.  Misconceptions about their behavior and how they process the input they get from thier world are better explained and I dare say that like humans this book is not a one size fits all but generally speaking it unlocks many keys to why your dog does what it does.  Being a dog lover it was worth my time to read.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|An excellent film that goes beyond your typical horror film in so many ways. The acting, directing, score, and cinematography were all spot-on in this film. I admired how much attention was paid to the connection between the pre-teen leads and their bond with each other. I never thought I would ever see a \\"horror\\" film that would make me look at it as a beautiful romance hidden within....yet also, keep me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next.<br /><br />The picture and audio quality for the Blu-ray were both flawless and I also appreciated the abundant special-features presented on the disc. It is rare that I give repeat viewings for films in such close proximity but with this film I discover something new every time that I didn't catch in the previous viewing. Exhilarating, yet very touching from start to finish and worthy of anyone's  collection.<br /><br />Note: I still to this day have not seen the Swedish version from which this was inspired from, so that may have eliminated any critical bias going into this film. My opinion is based on \\"this\\" film, and this film alone.<br /><br />5-stars.

Great buy....now im gonna go enjoy my Music!  =)
B004IFYN2E|4.0|I do not understand why this movie had bad reviews when it was in theaters. I usually see every movie that Jolie is in but I waited for the dvd for this one. Now that I've seen it I certainly would not have minded plunking down $7.50 to see it on the big screen.<br /><br />If The Tourist had been made in the 50s or 60s it would be amongst the ranks of North by Northwest. The Tourist has a wonderful look to it. You can NOT guess everything that's going to happen.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie has never looked more stunning and Johnny Depp is very likable.<br /><br />I would have liked the scene on the train to go on a bit longer but that's my only criticism.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I have been a true Britney fan since her first album! She has never disappointed me since. Her music has always been what her fans crave true pop perfection and no one can take that away from her. She has grown from the 16 year old in Baby One More Time. We true fans know and continue to love her through her ups and dwons. Her new album Femme Fatale is absolutely pure pop dance perfection feom beginning to end, even the bonus tracks are amazing too and thats hard to say about alot of albums. She has given her fans an album to put on definite repeat and is definitely a must buy for all her fans and those who love a great dance album! My faves(hard to pick!)are Till The World Ends, Hold It Against Me, I Wanna Go, Big Fat Bass and Criminal.
B0041IU1H4|5.0|A.  Absolutely nothing.  Holy crap, MOFI outdid themselves on this one.  I'm not going to write about the content -- there's enough about this masterpiece all over the web.  Suffice it to say, this is the 4th version I've owned of this album:  1) Glorious, fat, juicy vinyl back in the day, 2) first CD iteration in awful early digital 3) Re-release on CD with slightly better sound and some outtakes/\\"bonus material.\\"  4) This new one from the resurrected and better-than-ever MFSL.<br /><br />With the possible exception of an original LP pressing on Epic, this is by far the best this album has ever sounded. (My dumb ass, I sold most of my vinyl in the early 90's -- including an MFSL \\"Abbey Road\\"!) As an example, on \\"Texas Flood,\\" instead of just a muddy, murky din in the background, Tommy Shannon's bass has timbre, dynamics, and pace.  SRV's guitar in the bridge ***SOARS*** -- every note is there and now you can hear the impact of the pick on the string and the individual strings themselves, not to mention the microtonal differences from his judicious use of bending notes.  On \\"Tell Me,\\" the solo is now composed of distinctive notes, not just a big wall of stinging treble.<br /><br />I still think that at this price point, one should get slightly nicer packaging, but that's nitpicking.  Here's hoping MOFI will get into the business of putting out \\"Super Deluxe\\" versions of albums of this stature.  I.E. there's no reason why SRV's catalogue shouldn't get the same treatment as exemplified by the recent and super deluxe indeed Super Deluxe version of The Who's \\"Live at Leeds,\\" of which I was fortunate to get a copy before they were all snapped up.

B00065MDRW|5.0|It is impossible for me to pick out one King Crimson album as my favorite as they are all so very different from each other. It's as if they were made by different bands...which they actually were since the lineups changed so often.     The common denominator being, of course, Robert Fripp. He is, to me anyway, one of the few truly adventurous guitar players ever. Though not in style as much as attitude, he reminds me of Jeff Beck. Both completely fearless players who won't hesitate to try something totally new each time out.       Back to this album...i guess i have many \\"favorite\\" KC albums but this one holds a special place for me for obvious reasons. For any collector of iconic rock music....of music that changed and affected bands for years after...this is a must have.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|I watched this series in Season 1 for a couple episodes before my wife decided it was too graphic for her.  Bought the BluRay at Best Buy with a giftcard while on sale and it cost me $5 out the door from my own pocket.  Kept it in a drawer for over a year waiting for a good time to get started on it and finally, after all my patience, I had almost two weeks of sick time in February and hunkered down to see what I was missing.  I am now working through Season 2 with Netflix and am happy to report my enthusiasm with the renewed contract for a full fourth season on Fox.<br /><br />I like this show a great deal.  I was reluctant at first, being an original LOST fan that was SUPREMELY disappointed with the idiotic way they ended that series.  I was pleasantly suprised to find that this series does not drag quite like LOST does, and actually manages to stay on task with a story line that is much easier to follow.  Of course, it helps to watch four episodes in a single night like I have been able to, but this doesn't help ratings or support the continuation of the series so I've got to start watching on Friday's.  I have always enjoyed Joshua Jackson, mostly because we're close to the same age and I grew up watching him in my favorite stuff.  I have enjoyed the character of 'Walter' much more than I thought I would originally - excellent acting in my un-professional/television view only/no real basis opinion.  I laugh out loud at least once every episode, despite the general tone of the series.  I would also disagree with those who compare this hands down with X-Files, as the premise seems inherently different (off world v. other world).  I did not watch much X-files and found the acting less than enjoyable (which is also contrary to many of the negative reviews on here who seem to love the series and the acting).  I find these characters genuine and enjoyable.  I personally hope they at least have the opportunity to wrap the series up well and do it with style, unlike LOST (which was a HUGE let down to me and about the most ridiculous cop-out ending I think I've ever seen - I'll have to write that review, too).<br /><br />All in all, it's a good watch.  Catch up on Netflix if you don't want to own the series or check out Hulu for the free episodes.  It's really not that hard to catch up I don't think, but again, I have been watching one episode after another for nearly two months now in my spare time.  The premise is interesting and it's real science fiction - you obviously have to stretch your imagination to buy in to it at all or you wouldn't be watching.  Also, Walter does seem to be connected to every single problem they face and it's almost annoying that, in season 2 at least, they haven't just started asking him more directly from the beginning.  The connection is part of the intrigue for me, and they explain Walter's memory gaps in Season 2 as well so I have, at the very least, an explanation for why he himself can't seem to remember unless reminded.<br /><br />This product is a DVD set.  I put in the DVD's and they played so I'm happy.  I don't watch all the extra online crap.  Just the show.  I'm not really reviewing the product.<br /><br />Watch it.... don't.... know your own personal tastes and make your decision off that.ch was a HUGE let down to me and about the most ridiculous cop-out ending I think I've ever seen - I'll have to write that review, too).

B00000JGOJ|5.0|I actually worked on this movie as a movie extra and I'm actually IN IT.  Aside from that, Playing By Heart is a good love and life film that explores relationships and personality types.  My favourite sequences are those with Angelina Jolie's character, I just adore Angelina, and the sequences with Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart are also memorable.  I related the best with those characters I mentioned.  I also thought Jay Moher did a good job playing a character who is dying of aids. As for the rest of the movie,  I like the way Playing By Heart was filmed and I was also interested in the complex stories, making this one a winner in my book.

B004JY0KP8|5.0|I was looking for a watch that I could wear with shorts or wear with a suit ... or anything in between.  This one fits the bill.    It's very elegant, and the photos on Amazon do not do it justice. Use Google image search to get some better photos before you buy.  The case is shiny polished stainless.  The photos here make the case look a bit dull. It's a tad larger and heavier than I expected, but it's fine.  The watch face is what I would call ivory.    I expected a typical second hand that sweeps around the dial every minute, but the larger second hand you see is actually the stopwatch second hand.  The regular second hand sweeps in the small dial at 9 o'clock.    Also, I don't have the fat wrists (at least I don't think so), but the watch strap just makes it around my wrist with just enough extra to slip into the strap holder.  There are 10 eye-holes on the strap, and I'm using the 3rd one from the end.  My wrist appears to be about 7 3/4 inches around.  I might have liked a slightly larger band.    All that said, this watch looks and feels great, and it is certainly the multi-occasion watch I was looking for.

0307272702|4.0|Taubes stated that he wanted to write a book that anyone could read, not just a scientist.  He hit the mark with this one.  Why We Get Fat is concise and accessible to all.  The information on metabolism is understandable, and Taubes takes you through the scientific experimentation effortlessly.     By far the most interesting topics, however, are the explanations on why public health \\"experts\\" have been so reluctant to change their message (in spite of a surprising lack of evidence supporting their position).  I had never really considered the impact that government \\"dogma\\" would have on research funding, for example.      In recent years I have read books on cholera, the discovery of antibiotics, and timekeeping as a way to track longitude.  In every case, supposed authorities suppressed valid solutions to the problems for decades through their unwillingness or inability to see that they were wrong.  Taubes convinces that we are seeing this same pattern today. Given the mounting evidence to the contrary, proponents of the \\"low-fat\\" or \\"calories in calories out\\" lines of thought may be viewed as close-minded prideful fools in future history books.

B0042816YK|1.0|I was really excited to see the movie; however after the first 15 minutes I wanted to stop watching this due to it's extremely odd beginning that set the tone for the whole story.  You see in the beginning, Julia Robert's character, is a journalist who travels to Bali (Indonesia)to get a story on love.  There she meets a spiritual advisor who reads her PALM (okay this is where they started losing me)and tells her she will be married 2 times and lose most of her money within a year.  When she returns to the States she tells her husband she wants a divorce (based on that ridiculous palm reading).  Hello...can you say \\"selfish\\", \\"morally shallow\\", etc.    I forced myself to watch the whole movie thinking there had to be a lesson to be learned.  Nope.  Naddah.  The only redeeming value was the character was able to help a woman friend and her child in Bali realize their dream of owning their own home through the monetary gifts from her friends in the states.  That's the ONLY good part of the movie.    And it's ironic that in the entire movie she says she refuses to be defined by a man's love/relationship and absolutely says she will not marry again.  She ends up marrying the guy (not in the movie, but real life later on) because of his immigration status in the states...what goes around, comes around.  Did I say this movie was Shallow...yes, I did!

It gave me the tools to finally \\"quiet\\" the noise in my mind and focus on what's really important - the only thing that is important - which is this present moment, the Now.  I have never found a book that explains how to take control of your own mind in the way this book does, it is brilliant!
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I purchased and watched the first season not really knowing what to expect.  It was an intelligent, well written show with excellent acting.  I was eager to see the second season, and it was not a disappointment!  The show is about a Therapist and follows 4 of his patients, as well as sessions that the therapist has with his own therapist/friend on a weekly basis.  The problems that are discussed in therapy are not outrageous or shocking...but rather, problems that you may have faced or know someone else who has faced them.  It is enlightening to watch how therapy progresses and how it affects each person in therapy.  I recommend this program to anyone who enjoys an intelligent, thought provoking, realistic show.
044654759X|5.0|A typical Sparks book - maybe my favorite so far.  Are there men like Alex in this world?  I'd like to know.  But it's nice to believe there are and to get caught up in that hope.  I caught myself tearing up because of his gentle nature with his kids and with this new woman.  Part of the end really threw me for a loop - a bit \\"out there\\" for me - but then it IS fiction.  And why can't a girl dream, right?  Until the next book..........
0439023491|2.0|Where the Hunger Games was a dystopian, nail-biter replete with a good balance of wish-fulfillment, action, romance, and drama that even the Greeks would be proud of, Catching Fire rests on Hunger Games' laurels and takes a huge bite of soap to fill in the gaps.<br /><br />There are chapters and chapters of Katniss tearing her hair out, asking herself the same questions over and over, flip-flopping between love interests, dressing up, all the while lamely disinterested and loathful of everything in the process. It wears thin, and after a while the anguish is infectious in the worst possible way. After pages and pages of question marks, we finally get to the action and what Katniss does best: surviving... and it's short, thin on descriptions, and, at this point, lugging around the love triangle like a dead weight.<br /><br />It's almost as if towards the ending of the first book, the editors ordered up two more books so long as author Suzanne Collins inserts more Twilight into the sequels -- you know, to take a piece of that prized demographic -- and she complied, and complied, and then Katniss wanted to scream and wondered if she will ever see a question mark again?<br /><br />I would be completely disappointed if it weren't for the great concept, scenes, and characters that keep me reading. Although, the strength and hunger in Katniss' character in the first book is drowned in woeful, overtheatrical nonsense in this one. Apparently those hits she took in the arena aren't enough to knock some sense in her. She is so teetering on the edge of neuroses all the time, cowering in fear and doubt, I can't help but spend my time wondering whether this mockingjay will ever fly again.
0790731894|4.0|Just some thoughts...<br /><br />I found Executive Decision (1996) to be an action-packed, suspenseful, on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller that I feel is one of the best action movies of the 1990s.  Kurt Russell was excellent in his role as David Grant, an Army intelligence consultant and a U.S. Naval Academy graduate.  A lot of people were glad to see Steven Seagal killed off in this movie.  Me, I don't care one way or the other.  Halle Berry was lookin' good in her role as Jean, a stewardess.  Marla Maples makes an appearance in this movie as well.<br /><br />This movie came out five years before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  I couldn't help but notice how this movie seems to almost be a semi-blueprint for that event.  Maybe what I'm saying is that this movie was ever so slightly ahead of its time?  Does life imitate art or does art imitate life?<br /><br />If you like action movies that will keep you on the edge of your seat, then give this one a try.  It's typical Hollywood, but it's worth watching.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I might be writing this review too late, but maybe, this will add up some perspective to it. When I first listened to this album I was 17, it was 10 years ago, in 2001. I loved it then, and I still love it.<br /><br />I knew from the first listens that this album would become a classic. It might not have happened yet, but it will. Some classics are obvious from the first moment, whereas some others require time. This might be the second case, and by classic I mean an album that is regarded as an icon, something that you like or dislike, but you respect and look at with some sort of awe. For instance, I don't think anyone is able to objectively judge Picasso's Gernika or Da Vinci's Giocconda, but no one will deny their cultural relevance, or, if you wish, their status as fetish.<br /><br />Today, this album hasn't yet reached the condition I am talking about, and that is why it is still possible for me to evaluate it with equanimity. Or at least with subjective equanimity, since music is subjective.<br /><br />Anyway, my oppinion on this album is that it has a lot of personality. Its identity is very strong, I can see every song shares a common vibe. Then I think everything flows with grace, nothing is forced, the songs are beautifully arranged, the second voices are beautiful, the solos are well placed. I like each song individually and I enjoy diving into the mood that this album conveys. Forcing the concept and the air of Californication a bit more would make it redundant, not fresh. It is ambitious as far as it should be, it is a milestone, a risky business, the top of an stylistic mountain in which only one album fits. After this, the only way to keep up with it is by trying something different, which is, to some extent, only some extent, what \\"By The Way\\" represents. All in all, this album deserves all my admiration, and even if I enjoy some ulterior attempts by the Chili Peppers to repeat the ballad formula of which Californication has so many brilliant examples, I can see they don't work very well, they are out of place.on´t work very well, they are out of place.

1416972250|5.0|When I first read the City of Bones I said ehhh its not horrible but its not intriguing. City of Ashes was better but still wasnt one of my 2011 Book Obsessions. And let me tell you, right after I read City of Glass I was speechless. This book was one of the most amazing books ive ever read and definetely is one of my favorites. I was heartbroken in the beggining because Jace and Clary couldnt be together. It seems every step they took forward was 10 steps back. They loved each other but couldnt be together because they \\"were\\" siblings. Cassandra had an amazing way of using words and bringing real emotions out of me. Every time Jace or Clary were angry, I felt angry. Whenever they felt sad, i felt sad. Im defenitely excited and cant wait for the City of Fallen Angels. I wonder what adventure Clary and Jace will take us next.

B00433TO52|5.0|I am a BIG fan already of Shakespeare and I was really looking for a Kindle book as an added extra for my hard cover library. But I didn't expect to find this collection, with all these added things in it! So I must admit that the first things I went to look at were the extras, the commentaries and biographies.  And I must admit I am really enjoying them!! So with the plays, poems , the extra plays and all the other stuff, I don't think I could have asked for anything more! Excellent collection!

B002GHIPYI|5.0|I haven't had the need for a set of headphones in a long time so I've just used buds supplied with iPods and the like. I did a lot of checking on ear phones and usually go with the majority of good reviews. I came across these and while there weren't many reviews here on Amazon there are write ups on other web sites. So far there are no cons to me everything is positive. All I have been able to use them with so far are my iPod and my laptop, not the best sources for sound quality but I am pleased with the sound. I like to hear the zing from a cymbal over the thump of a bass. For about $40 not much to lose anyway.
B0041KKYD8|3.0|You're a smart lady...an author. You want some peace and quiet to work on your next book, so you rent a cabin in the deep woods to get some work done. The cabin is beautiful. Peaceful. You make some progress on your book. You get a little rest and relaxation lounging by the lake with a glass of wine, smoke a little doobie, and everything is a stone groove....initially. Then it gets really, really bad for you.<br /><br />And for the viewer it gets hard to watch. Not since [[ASIN:B000EOTVU2 Wolf Creek]] and more recently the remake of [[ASIN:B002DKGWSO Last House on the Left]] have I squirmed in my seat so much during some of the horrors that ensue.<br /><br />The movie is about 30 minutes of set up, 30 minutes of unspeakable acts on this poor woman, and 30 minutes of what happens when a lady that's been wronged goes [[ASIN:B000VD9MG4 Hostel]] on her attackers. Unlike 2009's Last House on the Left, there's a high degree of \\"that could never happen\\" in I Spit on Your Grave. Aside from the incredibly obvious \\"you don't walk into that spooky situation, you run from it,\\" there are some blatant story inconsistencies. But the most unbelievable part is after our heroine is brutalized and survives, what she chooses to do in between the time of her ordeal and when she exacts her revenge.<br /><br />BUT...it was all well-acted and every acted scene was very real. Uncomfortably so to the point of where I felt compelled to (but didn't) either fast forward through some of the attack on the girl or bust through my TV screen with an M16 and start blasting the bad guys. Turns out the bad guys might have preferred the M16 because this girl has almost certainly been through [[ASIN:B000EWBKLC Jigsaw's]] school of what you do to teach a bad guy a lesson!<br /><br />I Spit 0n Your Grave is straight up \\"watch this awful rape; now watch this violent revenge\\"...but it was as effective as it was affective. I'm pretty liberal with what I let my kids watch today, but this remake of 1978's I Spit on Your Grave is absolutely not one I'd be so liberal with. This movie earned its R...or NR. Whether you want to or not, some of the images in this film will stay with you for a few days after you see it.<br /><br />Bottom line....<br /><br />What I expected but hoped it wasn't: a gory, slasher, torture movie.<br /><br />What I actually got: a well-acted, albeit violent, horror/revenge movie.not one I'd be so liberal with.

0756404738|4.0|When I reviewed Patrick Rothfuss's debut novel, [[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]], I called it \\"the best debut novel - the best fantasy novel - in years.\\" I was particularly excited because unlike some other seemingly unending series, Rothfuss said in his blog that all three books were written. Almost four years later, we finally have book two. Was it worth the wait?<br /><br />\\"Wind\\" was such a strong first novel that it set very high expectations for the sequels. In particular, Rothfuss's writing, his use of language, was astonishingly good for a debut novel. If he didn't hang out in the Sci Fi/Fantasy ghetto with the rest of us, he'd be getting rave reviews from the New York Times Review of Books. \\"Wise Man\\" is equally well written. It's not better writing, but then that would be a difficult task, given the high benchmark.<br /><br />This is projected as a trilogy, and the second novel of a trilogy is always challenging to write. Think of J.R.R. Tolkein's [[ASIN:0618574956 The Two Towers: Being the Second Part of The Lord of the Rings]]. Often the middle novel is nothing more than a bridge between the setup in the first book and the conclusion in the third. Rothfuss made his task a little easier by telegraphing parts of Kvothe's life story in \\"Wind,\\" but the technique gave him challenges as well. His success in writing a compelling middle novel varies on the narrative thread involved. Recall Rothfuss is telling three different stories: Kvothe's biography to The Chronicler, how Kvothe lost his powers, and whatever crisis is looming the background.<br /><br />The tale to The Chronicler is well-told. Rothfuss seems to derive as much pleasure as Kvothe in reveling in that tale. The tale of Kvothe's lost powers is less well advanced. A certain rash pledge - Kvothe makes many rash pledges - may be the key, but it cannot explain everything. And the tale of the impending crisis is not advanced at all. It's barely mentioned. In a very real way, much of the narrative is not advanced, and that's a bit disappointing.<br /><br />Rothfuss's gift for characterization is on full display: each of the characters with whom Kvothe spends significant time is well-developed, and the Felaurian is particularly well done. None of them are stock fantasy characters; they aren't the cardboard cutouts that plague so much of fantasy writing. And with one new character he has created a sense of ambiguous, poorly understood doom that is the equal of any recent fantasy writing.<br /><br />All of which leaves us waiting for the third and final novel in the trilogy. First, I am a bit doubtful that Rothfuss can cram a conclusion to all three threads into one novel, even one longer than \\"Wise Man\\"'s 1008 pages. Certainly the pacing will have to be changed. The failure of \\"Wise Man\\" to advance critical elements puts more of a burden on the third book. If Rothfuss can bring it off and preserve the high level of writing, including the pacing, then we have a genuine superstar. The temptation to force the pace, compress events or resort to a narrative trick will be great.<br /><br />Second, \\"Wise Man\\" is bracketed by careful descriptions of three kinds of silence. It's effective in the context of the narrative, but I sincerely hope Rothfuss isn't telling his readers to gird themselves for another four year wait to have the conclusion.<br /><br />As a stand-alone novel, five stars, if only for the quality of the writing. As the middle novel of a projected trilogy - and recognizing that it's hard to judge without the conclusion at hand - just three stars. Brilliantly written, vivid characters, fine pacing. This is an exceptionally pleasurable read.<br /><br />But now we are back to waiting.narrative is not advanced, and that's a bit disappointing.

B002VECM4A|1.0|So I saw Precious, again, last night with a group of friends. We all just laughed at it. A friend and I spent the two hours reenacting the \\"Precious! Precious!\\" scene from Silence of the Lambs. The exception was one girl who watched the movie cuddled up to her boyfriend in terror, inexpressibly disgusted at the torrent of despair porn the film inflicted on her. It wasn't the reaction you'd expect from a film that, to take a random critical blurb, is \\"full of life and love, well-meaning and, judging by the reaction in the US, a genuine and important phenomenon that says act- don't dwell- on your dreams.\\"    But it's not surprising that bougie middle-class critics liked it. Precious is class warfare, naked and in-your-face class warfare, albeit of the patronizing liberal variety. To put it as simply as possible: everyone in the movie who's working class (save for Precious) is an awful person, while everyone who's a middle class professional is an absolute saint.    The film doesn't exactly give the poor characters devil horns and draw halos around the wealthier ones, but it comes as close as possible to doing so with one of the crudest devices available to film: it makes the poor people physically ugly (and very black), and it casts pretty and light skinned actresses as the middle class professionals (Mariah Carey is one of them). And boy, does the movie rub that difference in your face. You're treated to extended sequences of Precious' obese mom eating a greasy piece of chicken or dancing in skin tight clothing before going out to a club. The intended reaction of such lingering and voyeuristic shots is nothing but sheer disgust. There's an Oberlin student out there somewhere with 1000 words on how this is \\"the exploitation and objectification of black bodies\\"; suffice it to say that this isn't observant sociology but zoology.    There are good guys in the movie. The first, Mariah Carey, is Precious' social worker: patient, helpful, and smiley, not the harried and overworked bureaucratic functionary that real poor people are accustomed to working with. She directs her to light-skinned woman number two, Precious' teacher, who's a lesbian- I think we're actually meant to rejoice at how progressive that is- that lives with her partner in a tastefully adorned house with plenty of books and, I think, a piano.    And for the working class people? There's Precious' stepfather, who is only shown raping and impregnating her in flashbacks; the previously mentioned obese mother who hates and abuses Precious for being raped by her husband; obnoxious classmates in her old school who tease her for being fat and won't let her \\"learn\\" (her white teacher, on the other hand, is portrayed as another well-meaning savior, although he's helpless against the tide of cruelty directed at him by the poor kids); and street kids who harass and hurt her on the street for being overweight. Her neighbors in her apartment are invisible, non-existent; they don't even call the cops when Precious' mom beats her or pop their heads out of their apartments even to investigate.    There are her fellow classmates who are all girls and thus are all naturally bitchy, catty, and superficial. They're all initially hostile to Precious but are magically civilized by the light-skinned teacher (as is the typical power fantasy in these movies), and they even accompany Precious to the hospital where she gives birth to her baby- although they spend most of the time there hitting on a light skinned doctor. There's literally not a single poor character in the movie who is kind, or intelligent, or at all mutifaceted. At best the poor characters are just window dressing, at worst they're repulsive caricatures. And all of them are there in their resplendent ugliness simply so the film can brag that it's \\"keeping it real.\\" The film's \\"gritty realism,\\" however, is deployed in only one direction on the socio-economic ladder.    Precious herself is neither good or bad; she purely neutral, having less agency and independence than any other film protagonist I've seen for some time. Most of the film she spends crying and moaning about how she \\"can't do it,\\" which sets her up to be immediately reassured by her betters. The plot more or less proceeds in such a manner. She's merely the territory, the beautiful soul, fought over by the working class beasts and the middle class beauties. The film is tireless in patronizing her, but the two ladies pictured above do all the thinking and acting for her- which is the real reason the establishment critics like the movie; it flatters them. (Spoiler alert: the light skinned middle class people win her from the poor people in the end.) The name of the film even implies as much: she's \\"Precious,\\" like a gem, a pretty object owned by somebody to be doted upon.    Anyway, if I was a poor, working class person, particularly a poor black person, I think I would be absolutely furious at this movie. The system that represses them is beautiful and heroic for trying to save the poor from their own awfulness; the problem with poverty is poor people themselves. Now one can see why Precious received the critical acclaim that it did (it got a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes) in spite of its absolute lack of good qualities: it tells middle class critics that working class problems are all theirs to solve, that their failure in solving them isn't their fault, and that their ideology of patronizing liberalism is the savior of America's wretched. Like much propaganda, Precious is the voyeuristic exploitation of caricatured human ugliness for narrow political purposes.
B004E2XAHK|4.0|It's been a long time since I've bought an album on the first day of release without previewing it first.  I had faith that Within Temptation would deliver and with their latest, \\"The Unforgiving,\\" they have in spades.    \\"The Unforgiving\\" is ostensibly a concept album tied in with a comic book--oops, sorry, graphic novel--about a group who has killed in life banded together to hunt evil in the afterlife.  Apparently according to my comic geek buds this is a fairly common theme.  The concept in the music, however, is pretty vague compared to something like, say, Queensryche's \\"Operation: mindcrime.\\"  Lyrically none of these songs really allude to the story that's been being told in short films on WT's website and would not have been out of place on \\"The Silent Force\\" or \\"The Heart of Everything.\\"    But let's put geekery aside and focus on the music.  This is not the WT of \\"Mother Earth.\\"  They stated that they set out to make an eighties-sounding record (as evidenced by the \\"Grand Theft Auto\\"-looking cover art) and it's amazing how well they did.    \\"Shot In The Dark\\"--the first eighties flashback takes place in the opening song.  Lots of synths and--woo hoo!--a cool guitar solo.  This could have easily come out in 1987.      \\"In the Middle of the Night\\"--nice, fast-paced rocker.  For some reason the synths on this reminded me of Nightwish (which for me is NOT AT ALL a bad thing).  Sharon's vocals are awesome on this and the chorus has a hook that could catch a great white shark.    \\"Faster\\"--as the first single this has been getting some flack for sounding fairly similar to Chris Isaak's \\"Wicked Game,\\" which admittedly it does.  However, that doesn't mean it's not good.  Having heard the whole album now I feel this was a very good introduction to the direction of the album.  It's pretty much a straightforward pop-rock song.    \\"Fire and Ice\\"--this song dragged a little for me but again another great chorus.  Not that it sucks--no song on this album sucks--but it wasn't a grabber for me.    \\"Iron\\"--this song grew on me, another straight-ahead pop rocker in the vein of \\"Faster.\\"  Bonus if we're going eighties here--totally bitchen guitar solo included.    \\"Where Is The Edge\\"--although not the official first single this song was the first to be released publicly.  This song sounds the most like traditional WT; in fact I wonder if this might have been a leftover from \\"The Heart of Everything.\\"  Again, another fantastic sing-along chorus.    \\"Sinead\\"--possibly my favorite song on the album.  Super eighties-sounding, lots of synths and callback vocals, catchy, catchy, catchy.  This could definitely be the next single and this is going to absolutely rock live.    \\"Lost\\"--similar in sound (at least to me) to \\"Fire and Ice.\\"  Just a little too long despite yet another great chorus.    \\"Murder\\"--this is right behind \\"Sinead\\" in sheer awesomeness.  Sharon actually growls on this one, very sinister-sounding but in the best way, and yes, another fantastic chorus, dare I say the best on the album.      \\"A Demon's Fate\\"--Giorgio Moroder could have come up with this in his eighties heyday, he was the first one I thought of when this song began.  This, however, kind of fell flat for me.  Again, not that it sucks, but coming after \\"Murder\\" it sounds watered down.      \\"Stairway to the Skies\\"--a softer, slower song to close out the album, again more like traditional WT.  It wraps up what little story is alluded to and is the only song to fade out ... possibly more to come?    If this was indeed the eighties, Within Temptation would be storming up the charts.  In 2011, \\"The Unforgiving\\" gives every indication of being their most successful album, particularly now that they have a U.S. record deal (check out Amazon's sales numbers).  It is a extremely good record if not totally perfect.  WT fans and newcomers, buy with confidence!

B002L9N4DS|5.0|This novel is simple, but it is a great story. Forrest is an idiot and sometimes he could not do some simple things as other people do. Jenny is Forrest's best friend since their childhoods. Forrest has a strong feeling to Jenny, later Jenny becomes his girlfriend. Unfortunately, they are not together by the end of the story. Forrest's mother always said, \\"Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\\" This is a simple sentence, but it has influenced Forrest a lot. This sentence represents not to focus on the result because we never know what we're going to get.

B0025KVLT2|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />So many songs from \\"Rubber Soul\\" are legendary in The Beatles' catalogue.  It's not as outwardly creative as \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" but carries a mellow assurance that the band is pouring all of their creativity onto every song.<br /><br />\\"Drive My Car\\" gives the album a signature song at its start, the driving drums complementing Paul McCartney's fairly urgent singing nicely.  \\"Norwegian Wood(This Bird Has Flown)\\" is the first playing of the sitar on a Beatles' record and coupled with the offbeat lyrics makes for a song that is uniquely pleasant.  \\"Nowhere Man\\" is both a musical nonsense poem and social satire.  \\"Michelle\\" is a laid-back love song that fits very well on this record.<br /><br />\\"In My Life\\" might be my favorite song by The Beatles of everything they did.  A gently reflective meditation on life and its changes, it is poetic, slightly sad, and very powerful.  My only complaint about it is that it could have easily been much longer than two and a half minutes.<br /><br />I've always wondered why this album does not have a title song.  It would have been very fascinating to hear the band extrapolate a song from such a unique title.  Regardless, \\"Rubber Soul\\" contains absolutely timeless music.
0553062182|5.0|So much of the social part of this book was preaching to the choir, not that I minded finding someone who shared my experiences. I've handled being an HSP, socially and in the world very well, I've self-taught myself the skills I need, the boundary making, the listening to my emotional intelligence etc. But I didn't really understand myself, I felt flawed and that I was searching in the dark for each new answer to help me live a more fufilling life. So what I found most helpful about this amazing book, was how it helped me to untangle my inner workings: it helped me understand myself, why I do things, why some things are harder, where my gifts come from. Why I've felt bad about being the way I am (the social stigma attached to being sensitive, not being sensitive in and of itself). And it's helped me to understand why I behaved a certain way, in different situations, why certain things traumatized me. And it's helped me separate me being an HSP from how my parents raised me. Before, it was unclear to me how much of who I am was caused by abuse, and how much was just me. I was taught that my sensitivity was the problem: not how my parents handled my sensitivity. It's allowed me to stop thinking being an HSP is living with the after effects of abuse, which lead me to believe I was forever \\"broken\\", that the abuse had made me sensitive an would follow me until I was \\"no longer sensitive\\" no longer \\"different\\" not that my sensitivity just heightened the abuse, and that being an HSP is a beautiful, noble calling. It's given me understanding, and so: acceptance and peace.

B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Loved this movie! Finally, a movie without a lot of unnecessary sexual content and blood and guts. Instead a good plot that keeps you interested and guessing what comes next. Angelina was her usual beautiful mysterious character and it was fun to see yet another side of Johnny Depp.
B004SBX112|4.0|Unlike the version from the Android Market, the free version of Seasons purchased through Amazon does not transfer your progress into this one. This was not a big deal for me as I had only completed a few levels, but I felt it was worth mentioning. Otherwise, it's great(though sometimes infuriating(especially with the lag on the Motorola Backflip))  fun.  Definitely worth a buck, even better that it's free.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|This movie was amazingly hilarious, gruesome and beautiful. The cinematography is beautiful and the story line is a good mixture of humorous and serious. The movie can be graphic and extremely violent at times, so be aware before watching. The special edition is nothing particularly great but at the price you can get it these days, its not really more expensive than a non-special edition version. It does come with a DVD and digital copy which is really nice (and how all BluRay movies should be packaged).<br /><br />The high definition quality is great, and it looks and sounds stunning on HDTVs and surround sound systems. I recommend getting this if you like this movie and HD movies.

B004LUS390|5.0|This app is actually quite amazing.  Although you are certainly limited by screen space this is still  the best dollar you can spend on.... a sketch book. Even though I am by no means an artist, I'll still find myself making colorful doodles and some business card ideas within this app. The interface is rather intuitive and quite productive once you get used to it.<br /><br />Granted the average user could probably get by with the free version, I really feel the app was worth far more than 1 dollar.  Some people might like some more flexibility; I'm just waiting to save for a tablet and stylus ;)
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I watched this series in it's entirety back to back.Brought up on zombie movies of the action is better than dialogue standard, it was a nice surprise to see who the characters really are and how they cope when not being chased by flesh loving zombies.We see this new world from many different sets of eyes.From the old man who thinks he has nothing left to live for after his wife dies of cancer years before,to the backwoods brothers just trying to survive the best they know how,to young children who's world's went from not talking to strangers to not talking to zombies.Understated settings,deep rooted characters,intricate, realistic dialogue with a fresh spin on the zombie apocalypse.This series is for anyone looking for a bit of intelligence and raw emotion in their zombie cinema.Till next review.BRAAINNNNSS!!![[ASIN:B0049P1VHS The Walking Dead: Season One]]

1439152780|5.0|I originally gave book a 3-star review and thought I was being generous.  I was frustrated at the slow pace of the atmospheric narrative.  I found the revelation of layer upon layer of secrets to be tedious.  The premise intrigued me from the start.  A daughter goes to visit the country house where her mother was evacuated during World War II, an experience the mother has concealed from her daughter until recently.  I always suspected there was a good story hiding in there, but unwilling to finish reading the book to figure it out.  Recently however I wanted a recorded book to listen to, and on impulse I picked up this one for a second try.  I am so very glad I did.  Forced by listening to slow down and allow the story to wash over me in all its complexity I was completely pulled into the world it created.  There is a wonderfully Gothic mystery that slowly reveals itself,  a vivid picture of civilian life during World War II, and intriguing characters, most of whom are more complex than they at first seem.  Do give this novel a chance to weave its compelling beauty around you.  And if you find you can't get into it, try listening to the recorded version.  Some books really do work better that way!
B002VECM6S|5.0|I love this movie. I can't say enough good about it.  I've watched it more times than I care to admit to.  I love Sandra Bullock Movies, she's an excellent actress and she out does herself in this one. Tim McGraw did a great job too, I was suprised, he seemed very natural and at ease.  It was great to see Kathy Bates play such a good character (even is she was a democrat!)and carry it off so well.<br />Did I mention that I love this movie!  If you haven't seen it, you must see it, I cannot imagine that you would be disappointed in it!

B004FRX0MY|5.0|The app was just fine before, however the update allowing cloud storage was a game changer. With all the tech giants racing to get there first it was Amazon who quietly won. The app works great. Even on 3g it streams very well. At least I had no problems (Epic 4g). Google will always be my favorite company but Amazon with the launch of their app store and now cloud storage for all (and I mean all your music even your itunes can be uploaded) they are a very close second.

0618918248|2.0|I'm a social anthropologist educated at Harvard and the University of Rochester. I'm not a third of the way through THE GOD DELUSION, yet I can't imagine a better joke book for the money. It's a tract you give thinking people to convince them how silly Dawkins is on the evidence of his own writing. I can't say that I hate it, or that I love it, or even that it's OK, maybe because I've never read such bad philosophy. For Dawkins' sake, I'm glad that, within his worldview, he can ultimately disown personal responsibility for it as just another natural product.  P.S. I've now finished the book (April 17, 2011) and my view of it hasn't changed - not a bit. More book, more jokes, with a couple of the biggest and best saved for the latter part. If you've got some critical faculties and you appreciate a certain kind of humor, you'll love this book.
B004IFYN2Y|4.0|Valerie Plame could have stepped out of a spy novel or a Hollywood thriller. A beautiful wife and mother, married to a diplomat, she has a day job, and she's a CIA spy. It's a true life version of something like \\"True Lies.\\"<br /><br />It is a story we all saw unfold on the news and Sunday morning news shows in 2003. Plame's husband, diplomat Joseph Wilson is asked by Vice President Dick Cheney's office to go to Niger to investigate whether 50 tons of yellow cake uranium was secretly sold to Saddam Hussein. While at the CIA Valerie is involved the controversy of whether aluminum rods sold to Hussein are meant for the enrichment of uranium to make nuclear weapons. Both are discovered to be unfounded, both are answers the White House didn't want to invalidate their effort for a war with Iraq. The Bush administration sent Scooter Libby over to the CIA to try and intimidate the CIA into providing the answers they wanted about WMD. In response to President George Bush's State of the Union address in which he said Niger sold the yellow cake uranium to Iraq, Wilson writes an opinion piece that contradicts the President's assertion and the next thing they knew, Plame was outed as a CIA field agent, and it appeared the leak came from the White House in an attempt to discredit Wilson and Plame.<br /><br />As Wilson, Sean Penn turns in a performance where he disappears into the role without totally disappearing. Being the consumate actor that he is, Penn doesn't offer an impersonation of Wilson but delivers the sense of Wilson through his mannerisms, and that's what really sells the believability of the character Penn has created. Naomi Watts looks like she could be Valerie Plame's younger sister, and turns in one of the better performances of her career. David Andrews as Scooter Libby conveys all the condescending arrogance, not only of the Bush administration but of power. Adam LeFevre does a good Karl Rove. Sam Shepard does a cameo as Plame's father and provides a nice moment as the voice of reason providing her character with sage advice and perspective. President George W. Bush is shown in news footage.<br /><br />Director Doug Liman who directed \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" realistically shows the flip side of \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" they could be bookends, one that shows a fantastical husband and wife spy team, and one that realistically portrays a couple in that situation. \\"Fair Game\\" is a low key antidote to the fantasy. Limon also shows the repercussions of Plame's outing not only in the Wilsons' relationship but in the bigger picture that with Plame's outing, U.S. officials knowingly exposed her contacts and they \\"disappeared.\\"<br /><br />In the end \\"Fair Game\\" is the story of a family withstanding the most divisive forces brought to bare to divide and conquer Plame and Wilson. In the beginning of \\"Fair Game\\" Plame and Wilson have to live their lives as a lie. But in the end it is the truth that saves them.<br /><br />The only bonus feature is a commentary by Wilson and Plame which is good when the corroborate the factual in the film.of reason providing her character with sage advice and perspective.

B0033DQGW2|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Of the Dan Brown's books I enjoyed Angel and Demons the best, and then this one. I understand a lot of people feel this book not as good or dynamic as Da Vinci's code, but in my opinion it is better. Just open your mind to the reading and stop comparing as you read. Do your retrospective afterwards and feel the energy of the story.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|I remember seeing this concert on TV in England, recorded in the Royal Albert Hall in 1994-1995. The concert left me with the impression I had seen the best ever concert. Indeed you have to be a fan of Pink Floyd to agree with me but the visual effects were really impressive at that time.<br />So when the announce was made to release the concert in a remastered 6.1 channels, I immediately ordered it.<br /><br />Remastered soundwise, maybe... but the video is not up to par in my opinion. Otherwise, I would have given 5 stars because this concert remains legendary in my mind.
B0000028M7|3.0|I feel a desperate need to constantly compare grunge bands with 'Nirvana', sorry if this annoying. Sure, both Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley were sad and miserbale, but this guy never lets up does he?    At least these guys were more relatable than their previous generation, it was no longer the sex addicts, it was now the drug addicts.     However, this is a side issue. These guys really know how to play their instruments better than Nirvana. They write powerful hard-rock and don't indulge in long guitar solo's  to prove technical ability (like the previous generation). The music is complex enough to be interesting, and they know how to write melodies; listen to the vocal harmonies on 'Rooster', or the haunting chorus guitar on 'Hate to feel'.     But an hour of meandering, doleful music with few hooks isn't always a recipe for success, no matter how many creative metaphors about emotional pain Layne Stayley can conjure up. Infusions of interesting, tasty guitar textures is a better line to run with. Rating ***1/2
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, and that's coming from a guy who's never seen any ballet, even on tv. However, you don't need any appreciation of that art form to enjoy this movie. The movie is a disturbing chronicling of a woman's decent into madness under the pressure of being the Swan Queen. Daron Aronofsky achieves this amazingly well, with an increasing amount of visual effects distorting the reality of Natalie Portman's character. It reaches a point where the viewer can't take anything they see at face value, while always maintaining an entertaining movie. There's also some great scenes for the male viewers, where Natalie first masturbates (artfully of course) and later has sex with her co-star Mila Kunis. Ultimately, if you don't mind viewing a very disturbed beautiful masterpiece of a movie, then you have to see this. Also, while there aren't any deleted scenes, there are a lot of special features (at least in the Blu-Ray version) and I think the film will definitely hold up to multiple viewings.
B00002MZ2C|3.0|Unfortunately, Rage Against the Machine never won that 'battle' for Los Angeles.     However, that doesn't change the fact that this is one of Rage Against the Machines best albums. Their riffs can be repetitive, and their songwriting is often formulaic (verse-chorus X 3 in most songs), but they are very creative with guitar effects, taking it almost to the point of psychedelia, as shown in the excellent 'Ashes in the fall'. They also write excellent funk-rock grooves. And you can't deny the passion of lead singer 'Zack de la Rocha'.    This band does blend in with the Nu-metal crowd a fair bit, their effects are not unlike those used on albums like 'Follow the Leader' and 'Three Dollar Bill', and also the mix of rap and rock. But these guys have much more credible subject matter. Rating ***
B0034G4OY0|4.0|Clint Eastwood's Hereafter tells three parallel stories about three people affected by death in different ways; Matt Damon plays American factory worker George, who is able to communicate with the dead; Cecile de France plays French television journalist Marie, who survives a tsunami  and Frankie and George McLaren play Marcus and Jason, an English boy and his elder twin brother who suffers a devestating loss and goes on a hunt for answers.    Eastwood is careful not to offer any answers on the afterlife in his film because as he says at one point there are no answers to offer. He tells a good story that forces the viewer to evaluate his own ideas on death and what if anything comes after it. The film is much more than a meditation on death it is a carefully drawn portrait of how death affects people no matter where they are located nor whatever is their place in society.  One of the interesting things that Eastwood does and is to be congratulated for is that he chooses to present his French segments in French with subtitles rather than pandering to those who feel that everything must be in English this gives the film a feeling of reality.    The film is not always easy to watch but it does provide a good oppurtunity for discussion. The Blu Ray disc  presents the film and a series of focus point videos dealing with the production. Of special interest is the video which deals with the creation of the tsunami effects for which the film got its only Oscar nomination. Other featurettes deal with skeptics and mediums and a short on twins. This is an excellent package for a film that gets better on repeat viewings by a director who seems to be contemplating his own mortality.    Recommended.

And now that my son is a little older, he likes to tell me what's happening in the pictures, it's so great. It fosters learning and creativity in a really fun way. Cute story too!

B004NSULHM|2.0|Radiohead is flirting with irrelevance with this record - there are other bands out there doing this ambient thing better. Eno did it better decades ago. A 'band' is pretty much wasted with this stuff; all Yorke needs is his laptop. Despite what you're reading, I'm a fan...just not of these nod-out doodling-around \\"experiments\\". This is not a \\"new direction\\" - this is just the latest chapter in  Yorke's continuing aural dreamscape. I bought (and didn't care for) Yorke's solo snooze-fest \\"Eraser\\", which (as others have pointed out), this most closely resembles, or even \\"Spitting Feathers\\", which wasn't much better. And yes, I've given the record plenty of \\"air time\\"...no rush to judgement here. I believe the album is short because they (the band) realize these are basically half-realized tracks better to use as a sleep aid than a fully-formed idea. I know there are lots of die-hard fans who will proclaim this as a \\"masterpiece\\" and who will basically buy anything the band puts out, but I believe the number of those fans is shrinking. If this trend continues, I predict Radiohead will be a distant memory in a few years. An unneccessary detour down a dead end.
B004SBX112|3.0|I love the fact that I was able to pick this app up for free as my family totally enjoys Angry Birds Rio on my new LG Optimus-T.

B004ODLUF8|3.0|\\"Hubble\\" takes us out into space viewing through the eyes of the famous space telescope, Hubble. The 3D documentary is narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio and tells the tale of the telescope's origins, threats, successes, and the tale of one mission taken by astronauts to make some important improvements on it so it doesn't suddenly fall to Earth one day.<br /><br />\\"Imax Hubble\\" would undoubtedly be fascinating in 3D, I missed the screening for it. As soon as the introduction gets away from the astronauts and worries on Planet Earth, we are guided by Leo's voice into a rose cloud 90 trillion miles across where stars are made and \\"baby stars are nested in cocoons\\" where each cocoon holds their own solar system in Orion's nursery. It looks like something that could have been made up for a science fiction movie, but this is actual footage taken from the impressive Hubble space telescope. It's beautiful and dreamy.<br /><br />After showing off what Hubble can do, the film brings up the dangers of keeping Hubble out in space and the daring mission proposed to increase its longevity. It is very interesting to see how this all works, especially if you are really into space or interested in becoming an astronaut. Otherwise, it's like watching mechanics in giant suits work on a giant structure you can't even begin to comprehend how it works.<br /><br />Watching the DVD at home without the 3D did make me want to snooze a little. The calming voice of Leonardo DiCaprio combined with astronauts talking to each other through their helmets made my eyelids flutter a few times. Then oooh, back to pretty pictures! But I still felt sleepy watching them....and there was some overuse of that Hawaiian \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" song. This DVD is only 44 minutes long so just as I was about to conk out, it was over. For sure the highlight of the film was the rose cloud less than halfway through.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />\\"Inside Imax Hubble 3D\\" has interviews with people involved on the project and shows the Imax camera. If this feature wasn't so concerned with the making of the film, the interviews about the mission itself could have been added to the feature. Oh, if you leave the menu on too long while you're typing your review...it automatically starts the movie again.<br /><br />I know these films are very expensive to make, but the suggested retail price of $27.98 sounds extreme to me for a forty-four minute film..

B000E41MS6|3.0|\\"Doctor Who\\" the complete First Series was my first exposure to Doctor Who. Some of the episodes in this series are utterly ridiculous and silly, but the majority overall are fascinating, well written, have scary moments, funny moments, and have an emotional pull, particularly at the end of the season. The premise of \\"Doctor Who\\" is that there is a character called \\"The Doctor\\" (played by Christopher Eccleston) who is the last alien of his species and travels through space and time in a Tardis spaceship that looks like a phone booth. His Tardis is often drawn to places where important events are taking place where the Doctor can have a hand in helping solve a problem or save the world. He meets Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper) in the first episode and invites her to go along with him on his adventures and unable to pass down such an opportunity, she joins him as a sidekick and over time becomes more of an equal.<br /><br />Examples of the adventures the Doctor and Rose face together include mannequins that come to life, trying to change an event in Rose's past, meeting Charles Dickens to investigate walking dead, getting stuck in reality TV, encountering the ultimate killing machines known as Daleks, and saving the world numerous times. The most ridiculous story is two episodes consisting of farting aliens that wear man suits and try to take over the world by assuming identities of high up political figures in Parliament. The most frightening story is the two episodes \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances\\" where a wandering child with a gas mask keeps asking for his mommy and anyone he touches turns into a zombie wearing a gas mask just like him during a war. Positively eerie! Scary kids give me the creeps! The most emotional episodes are \\"Father's Day\\" and \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" where difficult choices have to be made and some characters meet their end.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The bonus features are about five hours spread out across five discs (not including the 13 episodes' worth of commentary) so if you wait till the end of the series as I did to watch them, you'll have to put them all in again. Three of the discs alone have trailers for the series, certain episodes, and even the storyboard for a trailer. There is an interview with Christopher Eccleston at BBC Breakfast that clearly takes place before the series has premiered because he talks about the differences between this new first series and the older series making the girl a better written character and focusing on the intelligence and psychology of the Doctor and refuses to answer if he regenerates at the end of the series and finds some of the early bad reviews painful to listen to.<br /><br />There are commentaries on EVERY episode that have producers, visual effects people, writers (Russell T. Davies, Mark Gatiss, Robert Shearman, Steven Moffat), and supporting actors (actor for Charles Dickens, voice of Dalek, Captain Jack, etc.). They never have Christopher Eccleston who plays Doctor Who and don't have Billie Piper who plays Rose until the last episode on commentary (which was also my favorite episode to listen to on commentary).<br /><br />There is a behind the scenes making of feature with Russell T. Davies that shows read-throughs, behind-the-scenes video of shooting, rewrites, and interviews with select cast and crew members. They show the effects behind the destruction of the lair in the pilot episode, Mark Gatiss has a video diary for his first episode about waking the dead for writing for \\"Doctor Who\\" admitting the amount of pressure he felt taking on such a big project and problem-solving plot elements out loud, and the origin of the idea for the unquiet dead from Mark Gatiss.<br /><br />On the second disc, the Big Ben destruction scene is deconstructed and an error is even admitted. Billie Piper goes around the set with her own camera showing the inside of the Dalek, pick up shots from Episode 4, and scenes from several other episodes. On the third disc, you can see the models of the large balloons used in \\"The Empty Child\\" and the challenges of making it visually fit together with footage of Rose hanging from one. On the fourth disc, \\"Designing Doctor Who\\" takes us through the set design of the Tardis, Satellite 5, Captain Jack's ship, and several other pivotal locations on the series. \\"The Adventures of Captain Jack\\" lets John Barrowman talk about his character's background and the purpose of this really handsome guy that showed up in Episode 9 being out for himself and stayed through the end of the series where he makes a stand. He also wishes Captain Jack had his own TV show (and so do I!).<br />The fifth disc has the bonus feature documentary, \\"Doctor Who Confidential\\" narrated by Simon Pegg who also had a large role in \\"The Long Game\\" about Satellite 5 controlling all of the Earth's television programming and news.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|Britney has certainly changed her musical styles from her humble beginnings of bubblegum pop to hardcore electropop and R&B influences on her latest album Femme Fatale.  It doesn't suprise me that Spears is distancing herself away from her Circus album, because the music style of that album is no longer relevant or hot anymore.  What is in are hardcore dance songs and electropop, the route Spears decided to take for this album.  It's best described as Blackout: The Sequel.  This time the lyrics are a little sharper, and the music and production are more polished.  Everything is kicked up a notch this time around.

B004H83IG4|3.0|\\"All Good Things\\" was directed by Andrew Jarecki and stars Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst as the couple, David (Ryan Gosling) and Katie Marks (Kirsten Dunst). Inspired by the life of Robert Durst, this story tells the tale of a real estate heir whose wife disappears. This film is based on a real unsolved mystery and provides speculation of what may have occurred based on tons of research, interviews, and a lengthy courtroom transcript.<br /><br />David and Katie begin in love as opposites attract, him being from a rich family and she being a working class student. They move away from the city and try to open a health food store but are lured back by David's father (played by Frank Langella) to join the family business. David talks to himself often and witnessed his mother's death at a young age. He views Katie as the perfect woman because he could do anything and she loved him. Their differences come between them about whether to have children and Katie's desire to go to med school and two months away from graduation when she contemplates divorcing him, she disappears.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling was an excellent casting choice for the role of David because he can show some charm and justification for why a girl might fall for him (as in \\"Blue Valentine\\") and then flip it on its head and explore all these behaviors of the character as he gets progressively more disturbing. Kirsten Dunst as Katie is a charismatic beautiful young woman who can instantly put people at ease and transitions into a lethargic emotional mess over time. They have good chemistry together and sell that the couple was in love initially before things got complicated. What is most intriguing about the film is David's behavior AFTER Katie's disappearance when he goes into hiding dressing in disguise.<br /><br />This film was pushed back several times after being filmed in 2008 and slated for a release in 2009 and finally ended up in limited released in December 2010 and is now coming out on Blu-ray and DVD. It is strange that this story about a relationship that doesn't quite work anymore didn't catch any attention around the same time that \\"Blue Valentine\\" was released which got lots of attention for Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />All Good Things - Truth in Fiction is a half hour feature that reveals how much of the story came out of courtroom documents from Bob Durst's testimony. They gathered together several sources and interviews to try and piece together a 360 degree view of what may have happened in speculation. Some of the dialogue in the film is directly from these interviews. They researched for two and a half years before starting filming. Kirsten Dunst met with the Durst family and learned a great deal about her character. There is twenty minute feature called \\"Back in Time: Researching the Original Story\\" that shows clips of several of the interviews done to research the film of actual people who knew Robert and Kathie Durst.<br /><br />There's an interview with director Andrew Jarecki where he talks about the interviews they did in researching the story and how they put them together in documentary form to show people as they created the movie and to remind themselves during the writing process. It's a VERY thorough interview where he talks about everything with the movie and goes on for an hour! There is also a sped up video of the process of aging Ryan Gosling to play David Marks in his later years. There are only a few deleted scenes, one washing dishes in the kitchen getting to know Katie's mother, another showing Katie training in the medical field, Katie confronting David about Polaroids she found, and David trying to get food stamps in a tuxedo which is very weird.<br /><br />There is full-length commentary with director Andrew Jarecki and writers Marcus Hinchey and Marc Smerling. There is also commentary with the director and Robert Durst whom the story is based on so of course after hearing all the background on this story and the interviews, I couldn't resist hearing what the actual guy says about this movie based on him. He verifies that Frank Langella's portrayal of his father is spot on and expresses regrets about how he treated Kathy's family and how rude he was. Every comment is prompted by the director who is interviewing Robert as the film progresses. Each scene that plays out, Andrew asks Robert if it was like that and Robert usually confirms it (or it sounds even worse than the movie plays it to be). He indicated that they were both unfaithful to each other late in the relationship (not covered in the film). It's fascinating to hear his side or defense.t resist hearing what the actual guy says about this movie based on him.

B0021L8UPS|5.0|A lot of horror movies this past decade were extremely formulaic, boring, and don't break any mold whatsoever, but \\"Orphan\\" is surprisingly a break from all of those forgettable horror films. It has a great setting along with a great atmosphere (winter is a great time to shoot a horror film), and the cinematography is also amazing. The plot line seems like something that's been done before, but it was used in a great way.        \\"Orphan\\" has great acting and amazing drama that makes the film hard to forget, because it is one of the standout films of 2009. For anybody who doesn't know what it's about, \\"Orphan\\" is about a mother who's looking to adopt after a miscarriage and adopts an orphan, who is obviously a psycho. I like how the film was about 2 hours long. It has more of a backbone story with it, more than a lot of other horror films. There's something about the movie that's really creepy, and the ending will most likely keep you on the edge of your seat. The film wasn't entirely scary to me, as I wasn't really scared from it (although some scenes were shocking, creepy, and unexpected). There is a great amount of border-line neurotic melodrama that actually works for this film. This film also isn't all about the killing, it's more psychological, actually.       All the scenes in the film were put together wonderfully, as it resembles the \\"creepy kid\\" type of horror movies really well, but it doesn't fall into much cliche, either. I bet if this film were in Spanish, American critics would have liked it better, but who cares about what they say, because this is a uniquely crafted and brilliant thrill ride of a horror movie.

0316098337|3.0|My three-star rating is an average, based on five stars for the story and one star for the way the story is told.       The premise of the story is fascinating (disturbing, but fascinating if you can get past the disturbing part), and the way Donoghue has imagined herself into the minds of people to whom the unimaginable has happened is truly remarkable.     However, I found the voice of the 5-year-old first-person narrator incredibly annoying.  The use of that voice might have been interesting if Donoghue had done it for a chapter or two -- or maybe alternated the child's voice with the mother's voice -- but over the course of an entire novel, the ceaseless childish voice came to have the effect on me of chalk on a blackboard.  (And no, I don't hate children; I find many of them delightful, I just don't think they should be narrating novels for adults.)     To give you an idea of what I'm talking about, I've written a paragraph in which I've tried to imitate the style in which the book is written.  If you can get through the paragraph without wanting to throw something at your computer, then by all means read the book; if you can't, then maybe you should think twice about reading the book.     Why nobody warned me about the awful of reading a story telled by a 5-year-old child?  If I'd knowed, I would have putted Book back on Shelf and runned away, hippity-hop like the Runaway Bunny.  Silly Me, I readed all of Book because lots of people telled me about the good of it, so I thinked it would get better in a little bit.  No way Jose, Book just goed on and on like this for 321 excruciating pages.  I know what excruciating means because that's what Ma says it feels like when Tooth hurts really bad, and after reading this book I knowed what she meaned.  Why Emma Donoghue made this choice? I've readed lots of books else by her, but Room is my worst favorite of all the books she writed.

B0029LHWFO|4.0|A Kenyan student at the University of Hawaii meets an American woman who is also a student there, and they fall in love. Never mind that he already has a wife and children back home; to his Muslim faith that presents no problem, and from an American viewpoint there's always divorce. Neither his father in Kenya nor her parents in Hawaii are pleased, but Barack Obama marries his Ann anyway; and his son and namesake comes into the world unaware of a divided heritage. For no matter what they may have thought about their daughter's marriage, Ann's parents fully accept their brown grandson. Their son-in-law chooses a graduate school scholarship that takes him away from Ann and their son, and after that he returns to Kenya. Ann and small Barack do not follow. A few years later, though, Ann marries again; and this time it's an Indonesian student she chooses. She and Barack join him in Indonesia, where they live until Ann realizes how thoroughly her child is being absorbed into a culture where he can never fulfill her dreams for him. Or, as she sees it, his potential. So she sends him to Hawaii to live with her parents, and that is where the elder Barack Obama visits when his son is 10 years old. It is the only time in the future U.S. president's life when he will remember seeing his father.<br /><br />This memoir is just that, the highly personal story of one man's experiences in coming to understand - and, at last, to accept - his heritage. I found it fascinating to follow the development of the man who would become president, the first non-white elected to that office in my country's history. I also found it encouraging, because the boy and young man Barack Obama faced plenty of challenges; and most of them were not at all the conventional ones of past presidents. His overcoming them and achieving all that he has heartens me. This is not a perfect book in technical terms; but it speaks with an authentic voice, and it held my interest from start to finish.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Nina M.

B004LFO0ME|3.0|Wiz Khalifa has taken over the mixtape circuit for the last couple of years while building his own and label, Taylor Gang.  The majority of fans have felt blessed with the amount of free music that has been created from VERY classic mixtapes from Wiz.  \\"Kush & Orange Juice\\" has been the most acclaimed.  If Wiz were to just feed off of that mixtape, polish it up production wise, he would have crated a very solid album.  However, he decided to crate an album that has more mass appeal, with pop choruses and references.  The aftermath of such an effort leaves more to be desired.  It's an OK album, but could have been more polished and complete; something that could have satisfied mixtape fans as well as mainstream appeal.  There is the problem with \\"Rolling Papers.\\"  It doesn't seem to have an identity.  Songs that could have been \\"feel good\\" tracks are muddled down with average beats that are not upbeat.  \\"Serious\\" songs, if you can call them that, are victims of the same average beats.<br /><br />Track by track:<br /><br />1.) When I'm Gone - 3/5 - Wiz opens up the album with a track that is his retrospective outlook of his success.  He speaks on wealth and the need to splurge it because it won't accompany him when he is gone.  It's a somewhat \\"feel-good\\" song, yet doesn't solidify as much pop appeal as he was trying to pull off.  The overall feel of the song feels as if it doesn't really know what it wants to be...a serious song or a feel good song.<br /><br />2.) On My Level - 3/5 - This will remind most hip-hop fans of early 90's rap.  The beat is hard, almost southern sounding which would sound great with a couple of other features (Bun B, Chamillionaire, Crooked I for example).  Instead, it has Too Short, which is a good addition, but having him on the song doesn't necessarily make it better.  Other MCs could have added to the song for it to be more than just a little over average song.<br /><br />3.) Black & Yellow - 4/5 - I've never been a fan of a lot of songs which suffers from a repetitive chorus, but Black and Yellow is a song that is catchy and different from many other songs on the radio.  It is the solidified hit of the album and might just be the only commercial hit for Wiz.  It's a great track which has inspired many remixes in the mixtape market.<br /><br />4.) Roll Up - 3/5 - \\"Roll Up\\" is a track that plays into Wiz's marijuana loving reputation.  It is an ode to a woman, but looking closer into the lyrics, it could be a love letter to Mary Jane.  Regardless, it's a well produced track that seems to have Wiz's signature sound to it.<br /><br />5.) Hopes and Dreams - 3/5 - Another track that displays Wiz's success with money and women.  It has the opportunity to be more than just a dense song about his favorite topics, but sadly doesn't get there.  The beat is sub-par, but it is not a \\"bad\\" song.  It just shows the limited range Wiz has in his material.<br /><br />6.) Wake Up - 5/5 - My favorite track on the album.  The beat is soft and mellow and Wiz's lyrics finally get serious.  He speaks on a range of topics relating to success, and he even offers a bridge in which he \\"sings.\\"  Something that might remind fans of B.O.B. or Kid Cudi.<br /><br />7.) The Race - 3/5 - This track seems to be thrown together.  The mix doesn't seem complete.  There just doesn't seem to be anything special about the track.  Wiz tries to add his singing again for extra appeal, but it just seems forced.  The last verse however, is the only one that Wiz sounds like he is putting effort into it.  All in all though, it is an OK song.  He seems to have knack to making average tracks that aren't necessarily bad, but aren't great either.<br /><br />8.) Star of the Show - 4/5 - This song made an appearance on one of Wiz's mixtapes.  It was a favorite of mine when I first heard it and it is one of my favorites from this album as well. It's a song that feels complete.  That's something that is not as common on this album as one would like to see.<br /><br />9.) No Sleep - 4/5 - This is the first song that seems to be executed perfectly in it's intentions.  It tries to be a upbeat track that is a party song and it succeeds.  The beat fits the lyrics and chorus.  Sadly, it took nine songs into the album for such cohesion.<br /><br />10.) Get Your S*** - 4/5 - This is a letter of some sort to a woman in Wiz's life.  It is a track that seems to have the most \\"deep\\" lyrics that are rare from the rest of the album.  He allows us to take a look into his bad relationship.  Many can relate to him and the words he rhymes up.<br /><br />11.) Top Floor - 3/5 - Another track that appeals to the \\"feel good\\" atmospheric mood.  Lyrically, Wiz is sub par once again, but the track is decent.  It just doesn't appeal to me as much due to the lyrical shortcomings.  Choruses are a strong point for Wiz it seems and he doesn't disappointed with this track, but it will not be a track that repeatable to most.<br /><br />12.) Fly Solo - 5/5 - This track has a guitar to add to its sound that resembles a track from Travis McCoy (of Gym Class Heroes) or an artist with a band backing him.  It's an excellent song.  The lyrics seem to be more cohesive with the feel of the song.  Wiz shows his true nature on the track and it shows.<br /><br />13.) Rooftops - 4/5 - Currensy is features on this track.  He is one of Wiz's most common features on his mixtapes.  The overall feel of the track is great.  Another which dedicates its subject matter to money and success.  However, it works.  There are so many tracks on the album that deal with the same subject matter.  Some work better than others and this one is one of them that feels right.<br /><br />14.) Cameras - 4/5 - Another good track that shows the true Wiz Khalifa.  He sounds comfortable with his delivery.  It's a track that can easily be a radio hit.  It's a mellow song that once again deals with superstardom and success.<br /><br />All in all, Wiz Khalifa's \\"Rolling Papers\\" isn't an outstanding album.  It might not even be great.  However, the songs that work, work well.  There aren't many tracks that stand out and more than a few that sort of blend in with one another.  Lyrically, I feel as if Wiz needs to be more creative.  His flow doesn't seem anywhere close to where it needs to be in order to be a respectable MC.  He seems more like an artist that is playing the role of a rapper rather than an artist who gets to create the way he wants to create.  With a more say in the creative process, I think Wiz would mark his own style and name into today's hip-hop.  Instead, he might just be a forgettable MC who peaks with \\"Black & Yellow.\\"to be executed perfectly in it's intentions.  It tries to be a upbeat track that is a party song and it succeeds.  The beat fits the lyrics and chorus.  Sadly, it took nine songs into the album for such cohesion.      10.) Get Your S*** - 4/5 - This is a letter of some sort to a woman in Wiz's life.

I first tried it on Killzone 3 for dead-zone calibration and whatnot and was really happy with the results, I won't lie is not even near to what a m+kb can do on PC, but its WAY better that using a controller if you mainly do FPSes on PC.     I went on to try it on the SOCOM4 beta and... GOOD GOD MAN, this thing is just too awesome! running a gunning was just too easy, my score when from a frustrating 1-10 to something respectable like 14-7. I finally can actually ENJOY shooters on my PS3.    It works with my Logitech MX518 and Logitech Classic Keyboard 200. but there seems to be some kind of turbo related bug... [...]    Other downside is that currently the firmware upgrade software only works on 32-bit OS, since I'm running W7 x64 I had to download and install Windows XP mode to be able to update the firmware, but once that's done you can setup the key bindings normally on your x64 install.    It's worth it if you find that aiming with a controller is frustrating and takes away all the fun from shooters on your PS3.

0143039431|5.0|I'm fifty years old, I've read literally thousands of books, and I'm not aware that I've ever read a novel written by John Steinbeck.  Recognizing this deficiency, I ordered a Steinbeck collection, seven of his most celebrated works including The Grapes of Wrath.  I vaguely recall seeing the film starring Henry Fonda, and am well aware of the plot and the historical backdrop, but nothing can take the place of reading the work itself.<br /><br />As most know, the book details the westward migration of the Joad family, as they are uprooted from their Oklahoma homestead by the evils of the Great Depression, the Oklahoma dust bowl and the advent of mechanized farming.  The family harbors visions of milk and honey awaiting their arrival in California, or so they are assured by the numerous handbills promising plentiful work and bountiful riches.  What await them instead are rapacious labor recruiters, unfriendly natives and slow but sure starvation.<br /><br />Steinbeck certainly succeeds in painting a vivid and stark picture of the hopelessness faced by the migrants.  His chapters alternate between \\"big picture\\" overviews and the particular heartbreaks and hazards faced by the Joads in particular.  The story is an education in economics, labor relations, politics and human nature.  In this day and age, it is difficult to conceive of children literally starving to death in the shadow of the most productive agricultural land in the country, much of it lying fallow and off limits to those that were capable of growing the food to nourish their own families.<br /><br />This is a very powerful novel, both with regard to the emotions that it taps and the beliefs and conceptions that one holds.  It provides a sharp contrast between a period when so many were desperate to work for as little as something to eat, to one in which so many demand so much without having to lift a finger.  There must be a happy medium.
B0041KKYEW|1.0|Title says it all.<br />I really don't see how this movie won any awards.  There was nothing magnificent, astounding, intriguing, enthralling, captivating or anything about this movie.  Just because there's a few fancy names doesn't make it a great movie.  I'm generally easily amused and don't mind wasting an hour and half or so watching a dumb movie, but this was like torture having to watch.  I couldn't bear through it all and fell asleep only to wake up at one sexy scene of Mila eating out Natalie.  I'm glad to have caught that part, but other than that there's nothing really worth while in this near 2 hour feature presentation of Aronofsky's more dreadful releases.  I'm going to watch Pi and Requiem for a Dream to cleanse myself and remind myself that Darren does have some talent as a director.<br />Oh, and please save yourself the time and energy trying to argue about this.  It's called an opinion and to each their own.  I don't care if you thought it was the greatest movie of the millennium, so you shouldn't care if I think it's the worst.  Thank you.

B004SUDQ4U|5.0|Amazon's editorial review is for the (almost) five-hour long version created as a mini-series for German television.  While that is available on DVD, it is not part of the Blu-ray to be released in June 2011.  The Blu-ray will contain the two movie versions released in 1981 and 1997.    Not much to say about the Blu-ray, it's release is not for another 10 weeks or so.  While Columbia/Sony is the KING of double-dipping in both video and CDs, this is one of those multiple releases I look forward to purchasing.  The Blu-ray will feature both the 1997 director's cut (3 1/2 hours) and the original 1981 theatrical version (2 1/2 hours).  While both versions were released theatrically, the 1981 theatrical version was not released in the U.S. on DVD, and although it was released on laser disc, a Blu-ray version is the first chance many will have to see the shorter version.  The director's cut was released on DVD, both as a regular DVD with a director's commentary and as a \\"Superbit\\" version, with maximum bitrate (and no commentary...did I mention Columbia/Sony is the KING of double/triple/quadruple dipping?)  While the Blu-ray will have a director's commentary, it is unclear whether it will be the same as on the first DVD (probably), or a new one.  Sony has announced that there will be three hours of new features with the Blu-ray, including a retrospective documentary and several featurettes examining the incredibly realistic sets created for the film.  The audio on the DVD was terrific in its day.  The new audio, uncompressed, should be even more spectacular.  Bolts popping out of the submarine's hull under pressure will have the viewers ducking, while the sound of water dripping down the walls will have them searching for leaks.    Enough of that,  the movie is the thing.  Das Boot is one of the most accurate depictions of men at war in any film.  Director Wolfgang Petersen captured the claustrophobia, the tension, the boredom, and the mad chaos of combat in a way few have.  For those who really love this film, there is the nearly 5-hour version available on DVD.  That version is unlikely to appear on Blu-ray; it's the original mini-series made for German television, and probably not as interesting to, and a bit long for, most U.S. viewers.
0307477479|2.0|I wanted to enjoy this critically acclaimed novel -- I'm interested in the music industry and willing to explore \\"meta-fiction\\" (admittedly with mixed reactions).  The back and forward time jumps in this story/stories of Benny, Sasha, Lou, and their various friends, band-mates, lovers, and people met along the way was an inventive twist but failed to save a book that bored me to tears.  I haven't used the word \\"anomie\\" for years, but it seems to cover the emptiness and uselessness of these characters, even if they could occasionally spout clever story-telling voices (the viewpoint changes throughout) or dialogue.  Sasha's kleptomania habit (ok, she overcomes it), which starts the intertwined stories rolling, is a real turn-off, as is record-producer Lou's obnoxious persona with his broken marriages, screwed up kids, and hunger for younger women.  The glimpses into the music biz and into wannabe musicians didn't convince me or salvage the book -- I'd rather be reading Keith Richards' vivid memoir than floating down this river of basically dreary, meaningless lives.  This one went back to the library before I reached the end.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|The handle is hollow plastic.  However, if the handle breaks in the wild, this is still a full tang knife and will continue to serve you.  Because the handle is hollow, the balance did not feel right to me. I removed the handle, filled the cavity with plumbers putty and reinstalled the handle. The balance is now better for me, though the putty did not improve the quality of the handle.     There is another replacement handle sold on Amazon, but a new handle alone is a significant portion of the price of this knife.  I figure if the handle breaks, then I'll invest in another handle or make one myself, but not before.    Only 4 stars because of handle; otherwise it would be 5-star quality.

B002ZG997M|5.0|a fantastic film, one that i will buy. (i watched a library copy.) i won't repeat the other positive reviews; i agree with most of what they say. i just want to mention that the cinematography is perfect. it creates a bleakness that is perfect for the story. also, the music is amazing; it's  like nothing i've heard before.

B004K4IZ54|3.0|I like the movie and think it deserves 4 starts but the extra money to include the 3D version is not worth it. The vast majority of the film looks like 2D. There is in fact a disclaimer on the 3D version. Save your money and get the 2D version.    Overall the film is fun. IMO, Bridges is the star of the show and has some really great scenes. I wasn't too thrilled with the ending but overall this film is easy on the eyes and ears and kids are going to love it.
B004NSULHM|5.0|If you only like Radiohead's \\"rock\\" sound, then this might not be for you. For those who enjoy Kid A, Amnesiac and The Eraser however, what a great one this is. From the cover art to the opening eerie piano loops, you really begin to feel like you are being sucked into a mysterious forest and then as the low bass creeps in and Thom starts signing over the sounds you know it's confirmed that you are going into those woods for better or worse, which turns out it's for the much better.     After the eerie beauty and strangeness of \\"Bloom\\", you are immediately swept up by the driving guitar and drums of the wonderfully moving \\"Morning Mr. Magpie\\". With this track comes a few rays of sun through the thick treeline and you begin to really settle into the King of Limbs experience. From there you get dumped into the \\"garage grunge\\" guitar riff of \\"Little by Little\\", a very catchy, slow-downed sing-along (\\"little by little, by hook or by crook, I'm such a tease and yr such a flirt\\"). After a haunting instrumental (which really doesn't do too much for me, though I like the distorted bass line that comes in towards the end), comes the slipping and sliding rhythm and vocals of \\"Lotus Flower\\", a light, airy affair, with Yorke's voice hovering nicely above the flow and groove of the instrumentation beneath. Following this nice piece comes the pretty piano-based \\"Codex\\" with Thom's vocals  well-matched and on full display (love that clear, crisp Thom Yorke sing us a song tonight kind of thing). As for the last 2 tracks, just great in my opinion- the exiting of the forest, calm and at peace. The amazing \\"Give up the Ghost\\" and it's soft, pleasant, mellow lure and Thom's soaring vocals (\\"don't hurt me...I think I should give up the ghost... in yr arms..\\"), might as well be the campfire goodnight song before walking out of the woods the next morning to the upbeat drumming and swimming instrumentation of \\"Separator\\". The psychedelic guitar that seeps in about half way through is a thing of beauty- \\"If you think this is over, than yr wrong\\". A perfect end to a fascinating experience- one of mystery and uncertainty, ultimately leading to a very memorable reflection- whatever it is and whatever it means (\\"...wake me up\\")    For those that like all Radiohead has to offer, this is a real treat.
1439102724|3.0|I love Jodi Picoult's stories, especially when they have an unexpected twist.  This story's twist was pretty easy to figure out, and seemed more like a fairy tale.      Sing You Home, like her comic book novel, got so caught up in the music that it is a much weaker story than her other books.  She failed to develop Max's born again Christian character adequately, and did not deal with how he and Liddy dealt with their situation - they all just lived happily ever after.      Her work is much better when she just writes a great story.

B003QO4BNO|5.0|Absolutely loved everything about the \\"Journey\\" performance by \\"New Directions\\". \\"Faithfully\\" gives me chills when the whole choir joins in accompaniment to Finn and Rachel (Monteith and Michele). The \\"mash-up\\" of \\"Any Way You Want It\\" and \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\\" is unbelievable! Whoever writes the musical arrangements for those is a talented being. Liked \\"Don't Stop Believin',\\" except for the key change. Adding a key change to make a song that is already incredibly dramatic and utterly timeless just takes it down a notch in my opinion. All-in-all a great episode, though! Glee is awesome!!!
B000001EUP|5.0|A breakthrough-record for Scorpions on multiple-levels, 1982's BLACKOUT was for many fans, their first proper introduction to the greatest metal export to ever emerge from Germany. Their eighth-studio LP, BLACKOUT is brimming with a fiery energy and harnessed with an unsurpassed passion - perhaps due to the near-disastrous affliction which befell lead-vocalist Klaue Meine during writing sessions for the record.     As the writing process began that harsh winter on the follow-up to 1980's ANIMAL MAGNETISM, Klaus experienced unexpected difficulty when singing. He was diagnosed shortly thereafter with polyps on his vocal-chords which rendered him unable to sing. During this time of uncertainty, vocalist Don Dokken was enlisted to help demo the material that they had been working on whilst Klaus opted to pursue surgery to remove the polyps. Luckily for all parties involved, the surgery was a success and after a short recovery, Klaus was ready and eager to re-enter the studio and plow head-first into the sessions. (The demos with Dokken were never used and remained shrouded in mystery; as to this day, they've never been released).    The resultant album which was the culmination of these arduous sessions was BLACKOUT; a torrid, hook-laden nine-track affair which sees the Teutonic Terrors eclipsing all previous studio efforts and primed for world domination.     Launching with the unstoppable blitzkrieg which is the title track, \\"Blackout\\" blasts forth like a tempestuous cluster-bomb. A jagged, manic Rudolf Schenker-riff ignites the band as the growl that is Matthias Jabs' Gibson Explorer envelopes the main riff and the formidable rhythm section of bassist Francis Buccholz and drummer Herman Rarebell lay the foundation for heavy metal nirvana. When Klaus \\"vocal-polyps-be-damned\\" Meine enters the fray with the frenetic lyric \\"I realize I missed a day/But I'm to wrecked to care anyway\\" we're off to the races. \\"Blackout\\" reaches and maintains a fevered pitch throughout it'sentire 3:48 and arrives at an urgent crescendo come solo-time as Matthias UNLEASHES with some incendiary and crystalline lead-guitar playing.      The shattered glass and anguished scream at the song's conclusion segues nicely into the in-concert fave \\"Can't Live Without You,\\" a vintage call-and-response song arranged for maximum effect. This particular selection showcases all the trademarks from which the Scorpions were now forging their brand of metal. A melodic Klaus Meine vocal duals with some catchy riffing and the rousing chorus celebrates the connection between band and fan. Lead guitarist Matthias Jabs seems to be having the most fun here as he interjects furious runs, squeals and hammer-ons at every available opportunity before opening up a can of metal whoop-ass with a blistering solo. Good stuff.     The classic ballad \\"No One Like You\\" follows next and what more can be said here that hasn't already been documented countless time elsewhere? Anchored by an iceberg-like towering riff, \\"No One' blew the doors wide-open for the boys in the U.S. in a MAJOR way (helping the album ascend to  #10 on the then all-important Billboard charts) and finally established Scorpions as the true international act they had been threatening to become since the late-seventies. A vintage power ballad that is made all the more remarkable by Klaus' earnest, yearning vocal and punctuated by Matthias Jabs' blazing solo. CLASSIC does not do this song justice. \\"You Give Me All I Need\\" and the frenzied, almost speed-metal \\"NOW!\\" bring side one to a close.    Not content to allow the juggernaut of sound to dissipate just yet, \\"Dynamite\\" springs to life from a still-deep well of creativity and threatens to burst into flames before it reaches its conclusion. Built around a percussive assault from kit-basher Rarebell, \\"Dynamite\\" snarls and bites with ridiculously provocative sexual innuendos and swirls amid a maelstrom of buzzsaw guitars and a typically aggressive Meine vocal. Heavy yet still tantalizingly commercial, \\"Dynamite\\" finds Scorpions treading familiar lyrical-water whilst dipping their fingers mischievously into a tempting sea of lust and metal. The remainder of side two is encompassed by the poppish \\"Arizona\\" (which foretold the group's impending evolution to mid-80's melodic hard rock), the sinister \\"China White\\" and the melancholy ode-to-after-concert-low-spirits \\"When The Smoke Is Going Down.\\"      Upon in it's release 29-years ago, SCORPIONS were on the precipice of massive worldwide acclaim. Produced in conjunction with long-time producer Dieter Dierks (who bestowed upon the record it's potent, stinging sheen), BLACKOUT captures the band in their absolute savage prime and shows them bravely revitalized and newly-focused. It is a classic of the genre and one of Scorpions finest moments.  -  Ronnie Jimenez
B0046UGSNS|2.0|Don't bother with this movie if you think it's a movie that does justice to same-sex couples. First this movie insults lesbians by insisting that they really want men and what men have to offer anatomacally.  The only way that Nic and Jules can have sex with one another is by watching gay male porn.  I wonder how many lesbians the writers bothered to poll to come up with that nonsense.  After Nic and Jules' children decide to track down the sperm doner who spawned them, in typical straight person fashion, no lesbian would be a lesbian if only she had the right man to show her....blah.....blah....blah.  Because we all know that a bored lesbian is going to jump the bones of any man who has a conversation with her.  Right?  Yeah, because that happens all the time.  In further ridiculousness, they end the movie by insisting that Nic shouldn't toss Jules' back side to the curb because they're too old to find anyone else.  So, it ends happily ever after.    Give me an F-ing break!
1594202842|4.0|It's unfortunate that this was reviewed so unfairly in the media. After initially hearing about it, I had no intention of reading it, but a friend lent it to me and promised me it was good. She was right, this was a very good light read. Throughout the book, Chua explores how merits in Chinese parenting are viewed as shortcomings in Western parenting and vice versa. Some of these merits/shortcomings include no play dates or sleepovers, nothing lower than an A, and learning a musical instrument chosen by the mother and practicing that instrument several hours everyday with no days off for being sick or on vacation. This book would be perfect for a book club as I'm sure it will spark many a parenting debate. I do wish Chua would have written with more connection and organization though, it would have made it slightly easier to read.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|SAIL is by far the best song on this Album.<br />The first two songs are lame and I deleted them from my ipod already, but the rest are good.<br />WAKE UP sounds just like Maroon 5. If I would have heard it one the radio I would have bet Maroon 5.<br />NOT YOUR FAULT is the second best song. It kind of sounds like JET, but better.<br />ALL I NEED is pretty good. It kind of sounds like a gospel song.<br />In all I would at least download SAIL, but I would get the whole album while it is still $1.99
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I went to Golden Gate Fields racetrak the year Secretariat was named \\"Horse of the Year\\".  My dad has always been a rase horse fan, and he told me I would never in my lifetime see a horse like this.  I could not get over how beautiful this horse was.  He stood out among the rest.  The stories are true about him posing for the cameras.  I did not know the whole story behind the horse.  The movie kept me captivated from beginning until the very end.  Great acting and cinematography.  I was a little disappointed with the horse that portrayed Secretariat.  In real life he was unlike any other horse I had ever seen.  I believe he was truly the greatest race horse ever, and the story...unbelievable.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Angry Birds Rio is way better then earlier because it has major graphics improvements yet it runs smoother then previous versions. Its great that we can get more and have it run smooth. The issue with it is, if you tap the blue bird just as it comes off the slingshot the games freezes and you need to force it closed because it because it will not respond again.
B002L6I9Z4|4.0|First, if you thought if this camera would be disassemble, you are wrong.  This camera is not disassembled. This is just one unit with 3 small lego blocks.    My kids love to play with it but not always. They sometimes pick this up and take some shots. That's it. After a few das, they played with it again.    Control is so easy. Just turn it on and push the shot button.    Regarding to the picture quality;  It is ok without flash.  It is not good with flash. The flash light is so strong, almost pictures with flash light are white.  So I don't recommend taking picture with this camera at night.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I'm just going to keep this short and sweet, it's a dance album. There is not much substance but I honestly don't like depth when it comes to dance records. This album is what is needed to just put you in a good mood. She has never been the best vocalist but she is damn good at what she does. Britney is a Pop Princess.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|Characters do not have the depth of the book characters.  Good movie though.  Better if you read book first.
B004NSULHM|5.0|I think albums come in different shapes and sizes and should be judged compared to the category it's in.  This album is not in the Epic category with OK Computer, or the Concept category with Kid A or the Collection of Songs category with Hail to the Thief.  This is in the Mood category and with that in mind it's excellent.  The album sustains its multilayered and organic mood from start to finish and reaches an incredible peak at \\"Lotus Flower\\" and white light/transcendence at \\"Codex\\".  Like In Rainbows, this album sounds better with each repeated listen because of the complexity of the songs; but the band didn't lose it's genuine/organic feel in the process. It' better to take your time like Radiohead and only put out quality music than feel the need to be more prolific and risk ruining your reputation/image which 17 plus years going, they haven't done yet.
B003ITDN86|4.0|If you come into this album with high expectations that this is going to blow all of their other albums out of the water, then sadly you will be disappointed. The thing with Sum 41 is that you need to be open-minded to the change in their music, since each of their albums has been different. They aren't the same band that is still in high school goofing off all of the time. To those who don't know, this album was written in a dark time for Deryck, and his lyrics definitely show it. This isn't some of his best work, but for producing the album by himself, it definitely could have been worse. The big thing with this album is that the pace changes a lot in most of the songs. So you will have quick beat followed by a slower one sometimes with the occasional piano. I personally loved it, but there are others who won't agree with that. Just remember, Sum 41 meant it when they said this was going to be a new sound. They definitely experienced with a lot of new effects.    The album starts off strong with Reason to Believe, and it starts off fast paced and ends with piano. Great way to start off the album.    Two of the songs on this album mirror a Green Day like sound  ('Time for you to Go' and 'Baby You Don't Wanna Know') and definitely one of the most interesting sounds is in Happiness Machine where it's got a 'Grunge-like' sound to it mix in with the slower paced guitar/piano.    Deryck also shows that he can create ballads on the album as well with 'What am I to Say' and 'Crash'.     My two personal favorites (which are both pretty heavy) are 'Blood in My Eyes' and 'Back Where I Belong'.     My recommendation:  The album itself is worth a purchase if you are a fan. While it's not their best album, it's also not their worst.  To newer fans, they have a stream on their website of the songs if you wanted to get a little taste of it.    I'd give it a 3.5/5 on the rating

It is wonderful today to be driving and singing my favorite songs just like I did in the \\"good ole days\\".  The Eagles are a group that are timeless and the songs are just as good now as they were then.
B004J4WQ46|4.0|I very much enjoyed this album - sounds great, eclectic, and has some fun bouncy songs.  I will definitely listen repeatedly and am very happy with it.  A very strong effort in my opinion.    I had read some of the more critical reviews before receiving this album and thought it's too bad that in this age of Itunes and impatience, people love to break down each and every track and rate based on an idea of perfection. I read an interview with Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age responding to criticisms of less than radio-friendly or less popular \\"album tracks\\" and his idea was that sometimes you have to have some rocks among the diamonds in order for the diamonds to stand out more.     There are those rare classic albums out there with no duds but even other classics still that have those less-than-popular tracks.  But they serve to balance the album experience. Those \\"terrible\\" tracks on this album aren't too bad, just not the \\"hits.\\" This album has peaks and valleys and I totally agree that it is more enjoyable that way.      It's music, it's art, it's unique, it's not former Strokes albums.  Give it a listen and enjoy.

B004I654WQ|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theaters I enjoyed watching it enough, but I kept thinking this was the worst Pixar film I have seen. Funny thing is the worst Pixar film is still A grade material compared to most other animated features released. And while Cars didn't wow me on the big screen the way The Incredibles or Monsters Inc (or a score of other Pixar films) the film grew on me in a big way when we got it home. You see my son (two years old at the time) loved to watch it. Being the inclusive dad that I am I would watch it with him. I got what Pixar was doing when I first saw Cars, but it didn't resonate with me until repeated viewings. Now, while it's still not my favorite Pixar movie, Cars made a believer out of me in what they were saying about this film.     You see Cars isn't just a cartoon about a world where cars are people. It's a tribute of the history of the automobile, a nod to NASCAR and its roots, and a love letter to Route 66. All of this done in a family-friendly and colorful animated universe. Any car nut with a broad spectrum interest in the automobile will find lots of different cars from different eras getting face time on this movie. NASCAR fans will love the racing sequences and level of detail dedicated to the sport. Those who remember the days before the Interstate system where there was as much fun travelling to your destination as there was being there will feel nostalgic for that time again. The movie hits on multiple levels, which is what makes it better than the sum of its parts.     Take that all away and you still have a fun cartoon. You have cars talking and acting like people for God's sake! The kids will eat that up! Cars are getting into crazy situations that are in their own way a slight play on human issues. There are plenty of little jokes on that vein that both the kids and parents can laugh over. There is even a joke or two with a double meaning the adults may get a kick out of. This is all classic Pixar and does much to fill in the little spaces between story development.     The story? Well like I said when I first saw it I got what they were saying, but wasn't impressed. It's essentially much like an episode of The Andy Griffith Show I remember seeing where somebody from the big city gets stuck in Mayberry, desparate to get out, only to end up loving the town and wanting more. Maybe it was because it was in a way the preachiest of the Pixar films telling us we should slow down our busy lives and go back to simpler times. Not that it's a bad message. Just not one that held onto on first viewing. Well after watching it several more times with my excited toddler the little details come into play that I either missed or ignored the first time around. The sleepy town that slowly comes to life the more their new visitor gives to it. The beautiful backdrops of painted deserts and canyons. There is character growth going on.    Cartoons live and die by their voice actors. While just about every animation company puts out movies that take advantage of celebrity power to gain an audience Pixar is one of the few who has consistently been able to get the best performances from them, and cars is no different. Every celebrity voice is pitch perfect and puts you in the view of the character more than the actor. Larry the Cable Guy as Mater the tow truck easily steals the show, but does it in such a way where you absolutely know it's Larry doing the voice, but you see Mater as a character in of itself rather than a cartoon Larry. Owen Wilson puts his best sly, but whiner-like demeanor for racing star McQueen that's his best. Some characters I still have trouble recognizing the transformation is so good. Tony Shalhoub (better known as Monk from the TV series) is absolutely unbelievable as tire shop owner Luigi. Better yet Michael Keaton as Chic Hicks barely sounds like Michael. Michael makes what is essentially the villain in the movie a very enjoyable and charismatic cut up. I can go on, but suffice it to say the \\"acting\\" is top notch.     Animation wise all I have to say is this is Pixar. They are just about the best in the business and what you see in this movie will impress even today. The race scenes are dynamically shot the same way you would see a big NASCAR race with gravel, debris, smoke and skid marks looking real. The level of detail is very impressive from the waxed shine on the cars to the minute dust.     This Blu-Ray release is pretty much identical to the previous release, but this time they include the DVD version as well. The differences between the Blu-Ray and DVD versions visually are striking, and that's admitting the DVD looks great. The Blu-Ray technically has two menus, but that's not a big deal. One of the menus has three options which are the movie, bonus cartoons and featurettes. Here's a breakdown (features on the DVD will have an * beside them):        Mater and the Ghost Light*: Like all Pixar releases Cars comes with both the animated short that was viewed before the movie in theaters plus a totally new short related to the movie itself. This is a story about Mater scaring the town with little tricks so he is told a story about the infamous Ghost Light, which he then appears to experience after left alone. Goofy funny with Mater kind of replaying a number of scenes from the movie in a different way.     One Man Band*: This is the short that was played before the movie in theaters. It's about two street musicians \\"dueling\\" for a little girl's coin. The musicians get more outrageous in their zeal for the money and things end up going crazy.     Mater in Bounding: Remember the Pixar short with the Jackalope and sheep? Well this is a quickie (non hi-def) short of Mater replacing the sheep bouncing all over the place. I think it's something the animators put together for fun and are sharing with us.      End Credits: Here you can see the animation end credits in full frame without the credits. Love the previous Pixar movie references.Production Features include:    Two Full Length Commentaries: One is by Lasseter and the other with the production team (with pictures).      Inspiration for 'Cars'*: Documentary told by John Lasseter on the inspiration for Cars including a jaunt through Route 66 and seeing some race cars in action.     Documentary Shorts: There are seven little items here. \\"Radiator Springs,\\" \\"Character Design,\\" \\"Animation and Acting,\\" \\"Real World Racing: Getting Geeky with the Details,\\" \\"Hudson Hornet,\\" \\"Graphics\\" and \\"Darrell Waltrip Museum Tour\\". This is the real meat of the extras. You get to see the real love for the source material and how much they put into making the movie as much a car-lovers movie as possible.     Cine-Explore: This is a way to see behind the scenes stuff while watching the movie. You can set it automatic or manually punch in the content. Much of the content comes from the other featurettes.     Deleted Scenes*: These are just sketches and storyboards that never went beyond pre-production. It's interesting to see how the script evolved, but don't expect extra cartoons.     Carfinder Game: It's dubbed as a very sophisticated BD game, but I call it incredibly tedious. The has three play modes. The primary mode is where you have to select a car from the bottom of your screen when it shows up in the movie. Next is the same concept, but this time the screen is frozen for an amount of time due to a massive amount of cars to rummage through. Third is like a bonus round where you get three images of the same car and you have to pick which one is accurate (with the other two having often the slightest differences in them).     The reward for going through the game (which you cannot get out of until you finish the movie with it) is a Showroom that has all the cars you found. You can click on the showroom and get a pretty neat profile of that car and it's personal history. I have to admit I really like getting this information as it broadens the story greatly.It's just a bear of a game to go through. This isn't a casual game to kill a little time. Be prepared to commit.     Cars is one of those movies that is very different from anything else out there, but then again you can say that for a good number of Pixar movies. It's a great movie for the car lover and those who enjoy remembering the 1950's driving experience where drive-ins and cruising mainstreet were how you treat a Friday night. Oh yeah... car racing fans will definitely get a kick out this film. If you aren't into any of that then you still should give this movie a try. It's VERY accessible to just everybody out there.

This book does a great job explaining the techniques of Neil's methods of getting flash right by making it look natural. I highly recommend it. I used his half snoot (black foamie thing) bounce method for a wedding event as the bride was getting ready in her bedroom and I was so pleased with the results. Plus, what photographer doesn't want to support the writings of an expert photographer who so freely provides tips and information for all of us on his website. If you haven't checked out Neil's website, you must! It's a wealth of knowledge!

B0034G4ORC|1.0|\\"Battle: LA\\" is one of the biggest wastes of celluloid I have witnessed in a long time. Many filmmakers have made the same mistake and have got to learn the lesson of this film: All the special effects in the world will not make a film interesting if you don't care about the characters.<br /><br />During the film's first 10 or 15 minutes, we are introduced to a variety of Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton. As each appears on screen, a title appears giving us their rank and name. And we watch each for a minute or two as we learn the one thing we will learn about them. One guy is planning a wedding and his fianc&eacute;e is getting her way with every decision. One guy is a virgin. The new Lieutenant is a NEW Lieutenant and feels nervous. Everyone else just sort of blends into the wood work and we quickly forget who they are. As each of these introductions occurs, our attention is also partially diverted by the constant news pieces on the televisions in the background - meteors are predicted to hit Santa Monica in 24 hours. The only character we spend a 'significant' amount of time with is Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart). Eckhart is the lead and the most recognized actor in the film, so we spend the most time with him. His story is our entry into this film. There is a lot of talk about how the Staff Sergeant lost the men in his platoon in Afghanistan. So when he joins this new platoon under the New Lieutenant, the men are dubious and don't trust him.<br /><br />As soon as the aliens begin their attack, the platoon receives new orders. They are to make their way to a police substation in Venice and help the civilians who are trapped there make it out the 'Strike Zone'. They have three hours to accomplish this mission before the government begins dropping bombs on Santa Monica in an effort to kill the invading alien forces.<br /><br />So, for the next hour and some odd minutes, the platoon battles an endless onslaught of aliens. The Marines shoot guns, grenades, rifles, grenade launchers, pistols, fire throwers, whatever they can get their hands on at the aliens as the men try to stay alive, try to stem the onslaught of the invaders and try to get to safety. But the aliens are relentless.<br /><br />And the battle is relentless. The gunfire, explosions, fighting and violence never seem to end. It just never stops, never pauses, never gives us a moment to learn about the characters in the film.<br /><br />Every line of dialogue is shouted. How else would we be able to hear them say anything with the cacophony of noise going on?<br /><br />When they reach the police substation, some civilians join the group. This is supposed to make us feel empathy for the entire group, to make us care about their fate. But it is difficult to do this when you know nothing about the people. Really, all they do is add more noise, crying, shouting, exclaiming. Michael Pena plays a dad trying to keep his son alive. Bridget Moynahan plays a civilian female. Presumably, she is meant to counter the uber-butch female Marine played by Michelle Rodriguez.<br /><br />\\"Battle: LA\\" would be a much better film if the aliens were even the least bit interesting. I really think there are only three different kinds of aliens in the film. These all make an appearance very early and then simply seem to multiply. In a better film, the Marines would face a specific type of alien, make some headway, than face a bigger alien, or a more threatening alien. This would ramp up the suspense and keep the viewer involved. But that is what would happen in a better film, not in \\"Battle: LA\\".<br /><br />Many of the shots and ideas look as though they are lifted directly from the far, far better \\"District 9\\". In fact, the film is very, very similar, in many ways, to the very bad \\"Skyline\\" released late last year. The aliens look similar, their mission appears to be similar, their actions are almost exactly the same. Even the geographic location is very close. This verybad film can't even be an original bad film.<br /><br />Actually, the worst thing about this movie might be a statement in the ads. \\"It's Only The Beginning.\\" Presumably, that statement means if this piece of trash is deemed financially successful, we can expect other \\"Battles\\". It doesn't seem possible to me, but I recently learned they are already making a sequel to \\"Clash of the Titans\\". If that film was deemed sequel-worthy, we are definitely going to be subjected to more \\"Battles\\".<br /><br />At the end of the screening I attended, people in the audience clapped. I was puzzled but realized they must have been thankful the film was finally over.<br /><br />I should have given a standing ovation.ing about this movie might be a statement in the ads. \\"It's Only The Beginning.\\" Presumably, that statement means if this piece of trash is deemed financially successful, we can expect other \\"Battles\\".

B004KSQN7C|4.0|I am not sure what Britney means by : I worked really hard on this for 2 years.  She got the voice but if she does not write her own songs then it is more same of the old recipe. Good sounding pop music with lyrics that do not even go skin deep and make her sound like she still wants to be 16. She has matured but her music has not. Or maybe she has not either, it is hard to say. If you like the easy on the ear pop music and dance floor music, this one is for you because she still has people churn out those songs for her.Many songs to choose from but they do not say much about her and maybe that is just the appeal. For somebody who has gone through some tough times in public, some things should still be secret. So her real level of inner happyness stays a secret, her music does not.
0307272702|4.0|As much as I enjoy his writing and his arguments, I wish Taubes had considered the effect of exercise other than running. Changing the fat/lean body ratio in favor of muscle -- to increase metabolic rate -- can affect the 23.5 hours a day we don't exercise. There are studies that include resistance training, metabolism and fat loss. I'd like to see his analysis, because there are people who care about losing fat, not necessarily losing weight.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I purchased this DVD for the times I could not make it to the gym.  I wanted to get a good workout in and Jillian seems to be the one to get me shredded at home.  I haven't done the workout yet but my boyfriend who made me promise I would not make him exercise does it faithfully every night.  In only 1 1/2 weeks he is tighter, his belly is coming down noticeably and his arms are looking bigger.  He is red and sweaty after working out but looking good.  I have watched the video at different points and it is a good workout and this is only Level 1.

B0049P1VHS|4.0|It's finally happened. A Zombie tv show. And get this they are actually slow!!! Amazing, with all those miraculously fast zombies that keep popping up. How is that possible? You are dead and decomposing? Right?<br /><br />Anyway, this is a must see for anyone who like the zombie genre. I would also suggest this to someone who is new to the genre. As we have seen from the history of zombie film, humans are more dangerous to each other than zombie to human. Once again the zombies exist here as a catalyst to let the tensions between the humans escalate.<br /><br />Cinematic...and beautiful. Eerily quite as well as some good credit sequence songs.<br /><br />It all fell into place with one quote \\"Hey Dumba$$ in the Tank\\"...From that point forth it was gonna be fun.
0525423273|5.0|Stephanie Perkins' Anna and the French Kiss is blissfully romantic, sweet, and funny!  I loved so much about this book, but before I start raving about its excellence, I must make a quick confession.  It took me way too long to get around to reading Anna and the French Kiss, and I took my time in picking it up for the silliest reason ever.  I had heard so much positive buzz about it that I was afraid it could not possibly live up to the hype.  Kids, don't be like me.  Don't let glowing reviews scare you away from amazing books.  And if you don't own it already, don't wait another second before buying Anna and the French Kiss!  It is made of awesome and exceeded all of my expectations.<br /><br />What I Liked:<br />-  I loved that the characters feel genuine.  Anna and her classmates (and former classmates and former co-workers) all have flaws and realistically complex relationships and personalities.<br />-  Every character has a distinct voice.  Meredith doesn't interact with Rashmi in the same way that she interacts with St. Clair.  And St. Clair doesn't talk to Anna the same way he talks to Josh.  If you covered up the names associated with any line of dialogue on any page, I bet you could still tell exactly who said what to whom just by their distinct ways of interacting with one another.  I adore that.<br />-  This story is totally in harmony with its setting.  Some books have vividly drawn atmospheres, allowing readers to thoroughly immerse themselves in the sights, smells, and flavors of a particular location and time period.  Other books have richly imagined characters that pop off the pages and make readers laugh and cry along with them.  This book has both.<br />-  The pacing is perfect, so Anna and the reader fall in love with &Eacute;tienne and Paris simultaneously.<br />-  Anna is such a dynamic character.  She grows and changes and learns from her mistakes and keeps moving forward right to the very last page.  Her perspective on virtually everything in her life shifts over the course of the year, but she isn't simply redefined by the person (or the place) she falls in love with.  She is still very much herself by the end of the book, just a wiser, more independent, more confident, and perhaps more forgiving version of herself.  I found her likable from start to finish, and I think she is proof that protagonists don't have to be generically good or utterly bland and static to feel like an 'every-girl' character to whom we can all relate.<br />-  This book is filled with tension, and not just romantic tension.  From friendships, to familial relationships, to romantic entanglements, every relationship in this book captures realistic tension and conflict.  Even her relationship with Paris itself is rich with tension and conflict.  Anna deals with jealousy, frustration, fear, and longing while navigating the streets of Paris and while navigating her increasingly complicated relationships with her old friends, new friends, family, and potential boyfriends.  I loved that she doesn't always make the easiest choices or the kindest choices, but she always makes believable choices.  I enjoyed following every step of Anna's journey from the moments of frustrated anger to the moments of impressive clarity.<br />-  &Eacute;tienne St. Clair ... what can I say about that boy?  He is a charming and witty history buff who loves his mother.  And his sexiness doesn't depend solely upon his more obvious charms like his British accent or his perfect hair, it is in his crooked bottom teeth, his shorter-than-average stature, his tidy room full of books, the way he bites his nails, and his willingness to wear the unfashionable stocking cap that his mum knitted despite his friends' objections.  It is also in Point Zero, in his enthusiastic support of Anna's passion for films, in the way he is there for her when she needs encouragement or distraction, and in the way his eyes light up when she says his name.  I can't say for certain when hewon my undying allegiance, but it may have been the moment he first said \\"Fo' shiz\\" and made me burst into laughter in the middle of a quiet room.<br />-  I am such a sucker for best friend romances, and this particular story has so many heart-racing flirtatious moments and so many emotionally intimate moments that it feels like watching two people fall in love in deliciously torturous slow-motion.  It is beautiful, sweet, flutter-inducing, heart-breaking, nerve-wracking... and did I mention romantic?<br />-  The plot element that I worried could stand in the way of my being able to fully adore this book, the fact that the boy Anna loves is in a serious relationship with someone else, was handled so honestly (and so painfully) that it did not stop me from loving &Eacute;tienne or from relating to Anna.<br />-  I loved that the end of this book is conclusive without feeling like the end of Anna's story.  Instead, it feels like a wonderful beginning.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss is a sweet, funny, and romantic story about friendship, growing up, and falling in love.  If you are a fan of contemporary romance or sweet coming of age stories, then you will want to check out Anna and the French Kiss. I can't wait to read Lola and the Boy Next Door (Autumn 2011) & Isla and the Happily Ever After (Autumn 2012)!e, but it may have been the moment he first said \\"Fo' shiz\\" and made me burst into laughter in the middle of a quiet room.  -     I am such a sucker for best friend romances, and this particular story has so many heart-racing flirtatious moments and so many emotionally intimate moments that it feels like watching two people fall in love in deliciously torturous slow-motion.

0131480057|5.0|This is my second book in the series. I had read the earlier version a few years ago which covered various Unix flavors only. Now with the ubiquity of Linux, the authors have done a great job of covering Linux in detail. My favorite chapters are the ones on Networking. The writing is very simple, comprehensive and accurate. The book does not assume a great deal of experience and explains the topics that users new to Linux/Unix will find easy to understand. At the same time, the book has enough details to keep experienced users busy.  A good book overall, recommended for all levels of Linux/Unix expertise.

B004KSQN7C|2.0|After the awfulness that was the Circus album, I sort of boycotted Britney and was really hesitant to give her another chance with Femme Fatale. I'm even more hesitant to post a review for it, because looking at all the others here on Amazon, it seems like no matter what the rating is, 1 star or 5, none have received very many \\"helpful\\" votes. Eventually my curiosity did get the best of me and I caved in, because I do generally love techno music and was hoping this might be a good direction for her, but alas my initial hunch proved correct and it disappointed on a number of levels.<br /><br />First just let me say that nothing about it is blatantly terrible at first listen. The problem is that nothing jumped out at me as being especially good, either. It's just one big pile of...noise. In the past, pre-2008 at least, Britney was able to deliver songs that were infectious and catchy, songs that would make you want to get up and dance or that  would get stuck in your head for days on end. However not one of the tracks on Femme Fatale has a catchy hook, or even a  real chorus to sing along to.  I have nothing against computerized vocals, in fact I really love it  if it's done right. This is lazy and sloppy. The majority of the tracks are made up of one word or phrase looped four hundred times over a random mish-mash of bleeps and blips that never amount to a distinctive melody. The only faint praise I can give this is that what little you hear of Britney's real voice sounds pretty good. You can tell she maybe wanted to use her vocals in ways she never has before and stretch herself to exciting new limits, but unfortunately Britney herself had no creative input on this album and is simply acting as the window dressing for a record that's geared more towards showing off the \\"hot beats\\" of the producers involved. Ironically, the one song that I thought DID have a good groove, Big Fat Bass, was instantly ruined the second will.i.am showed up. Nothing wrecks a good pop song quicker than the obligatory rapper interlude.<br /><br />Of course now this begs the question of why after 13 years in the music business Britney hasn't taken more control of her career and is still being played for a puppet. You'd think after everything she's been through, at this point she might have something mature or insightful to say, but instead she's still putting out the same mass-produced bubblegum crapola she's been singing about since day one. Nothing wrong with that if it's fun and catchy crapola (lol), but it seems she can't even offer that up anymore. I'll be be the first to admit that I like my share of mindless pop music and there's certainly a market for it, but it's sad she's never been able to evolve into anything else. It's almost humorous to think at one point people were calling her the \\"next Madonna,\\" who of course is all about reinvention. Don't get me wrong, Britney has provided some awesome entertainment along the way and is certainly an icon of sorts in herself, but at the end of the day I'm still left wondering why she hasn't grown up with the rest of us. Seriously. Stop talking about hot your body is or badly you want to hook up with a boy you meet in the club. Write songs that matter. (Write your own songs period.)  Make a statement. I just feel like she's been through too much in \\"real life\\" and is too old to still be pulling the sexy little kitten shtick and it's wearing thin to the point of being pathetic. Believe me, she's far from being a Femme Fatale. In fact I'll eat my right foot if she can spell that all by herself. Honestly, if she had any substance or staying power she wouldn't NEED to keep launching these \\"comebacks\\" every few years, because she wouldn't fall off our radars so quickly to begin with. In my humble opinion, of course.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant there. I don't wish to critique Ms. Spears as a human being, but as someone who used to be a pretty big fan of hers I don't think I'm being completely unreasonableeither. Just honest. If you genuinely do enjoy Britney's new music, cool. I've certainly heard worse. I just cannot in good conscience keep wasting money to support these \\"artists\\" who are so shallow and distant from the poor music their names are attached to. And who knows...if in another couple years she comes back with a disc full of songs she had a hand in creating which covers topics that are important to her, then I'll be first in line and smile at being proven wrong.either.

B003UESJHO|5.0|What elevates this movie, aside from the great acting across the board, is the soundtrack. From the beginning to the end, the use of music to create mood and tension is terrific and maybew the best since Pulp Fiction.  The movie is also excellent on many technical levels including the camera work.  Wahlberg and Adams are somewhat low key compared to Bales, but their acting is focussed and believable; Wahlberg's scenes as a fighter are great, and Amy throws a good punch as well.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|The big fat bass and Britney in your face! The Deluxe version is a must... great set of songs.. the  Britney dance-fest many of us have been waiting for. This collection is dripping with fun electro-pop, a bit of dub-step and more. Judging if you like this cd and warrant a purchase just by listening to snippets is not giving it a fair shake.  I have seen Britney live back in the 'OOps I Did it Again Days' & found it to be a fun time even though there was some lyp-synching going on. Britney can sometimes feel manufactured for sure however that is nothing new in the pop music realm. What she does bring to it is her style, personality and 'It' factor. Femme-Fatale is going to be great to hear this summer, sorry neighbors... play it LOUD! Thanks Brit for this bangin' new music....

It's fun, challenging, and cute.  System is Droid X, Android 2.2; no problems with download or playing.  It does use battery like crazy though - be warned about that.

I'm not asking for the app to be translated, but for it to be available no matter what your language settings are. Good think Google Music is on its way.
0765348276|5.0|What if our consciousness could be transferred to a new body and our natural lives extended? At what cost would that advancement be? This book quickly draws you in and creates a strong attachment to the central character. I can see the parallels to Heinlein and honestly, it doesn't lessen my enjoyment of the book. It's good military sci-fi and I couldn't put it down.

B004EQAVHI|4.0|I bought this solely becouse Carey Mulligan is my favourite Actress and i am glad i did-what a terrific film it turned out to be with Mulligan as good as allways.Full credit to Andrew Garfield also for his powerfull performance.  Keira Kightly comes across as a bit wooden for the first half of the film but realy picks up speed from then on and equals her two co-stars.  Its nice to see a young cast handle themselfs so well-no wonder Carey is my favourite!
160059672X|5.0|The other reviewers have pretty much said it all: these are great designs in the designer's signature style. The book is attractively laid out, with lots of photos and easy to read diagrams, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.     I was a little apprehensive about buying this sight unseen because I've encountered some books from well-known author/designers in which they seem to be coasting on their reputation rather than continuing to provide innovative, high-quality designs. This book does not disappoint, however.
B004M66YSA|5.0|The Pains of Being Pure at Heart deliver on the promise of their sparkling debut album with their follow-up, Belong.  Here the band takes all the ingredients that worked so well the first time around -- tight song structures, solid hooks, melancholy lyrical themes, healthy doses of early '90s shoegazing nostalgia -- and expands their sonic reach into the stratosphere.  With heavy-hitter producers Flood and Moulder behind the boards, the band elaborates on their previously lo-fi aesthetic and introduces dense layers of distorted guitar that cut through the mix and demand your full attention.  The songwriting has gotten even more refined, the hooks bigger and the songs themselves feeling more emotionally charged than ever.  Where the rhythm section sounded relatively compact and unassuming behind the fuzzy guitars on their first album, the drums are huge, propulsive and thundering throughout the album as the bass lines rumble with a U2-style sense of anthemic grandeur.  All of this could have spelled disaster for a band whose charm seemed in part indebted to its vintage-sounding production style, but instead, the band smartly utilizes this broader sonic palette to bring their ideas and moods to life in a new way.  While a few fans might not dig the big-and-shiny bombast, most should find this a very satisfying listen, and surely this will be the album that brings them more mainstream attention, as well.  While heavier tunes dominate the set list, there are some welcomed tamer moments, such as the New Order-inspired songs \\"Heart in the Heartbreak\\" and The Body.\\"  On the final track, \\"Strange\\" The Pains slightly tweak their usual verse-chorus-verse formula, opting instead for a steady, droning rhythm that builds into a lush, exhilarating climax.  These flourishes of diversity keep the album from sounding one-dimensional, demonstrating that this band has again made all the right decisions and produced a big-sounding album that still retains the charm and character of their previous work.
B0041KOVUU|5.0|Indeed an Kaleidoscyscope, ofcourse the score is great and renewed. But what's more, it's back to the old vinyl days when the artists had eye for the music. Yes I said eye, the musiclover sitting on the floor near the recordplayer. Album in hand, enjoying the music and art by ear and eye.  Yes you can download the music for free on the Pumpkins website. No you won't enjoy the artwork. All I'm saying is; buy the album or actually the complete series. And you'll support the completion of something that will be remembered for a long time, if not forever, in the art of music.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|I bought the DVD cause I REALLY wanted to see it in the theatre and did not have the chance.  It was a good performance, but just a crazy insane batxxit story.  I am a fan of ballet, but this was just wacko.  It's a movie I will watch once and never again.  I wish I would have rented it. The dancing was not good enough to make me watch again.    I think if you are into mental illness you will enjoy watching more than once.
159420229X|1.0|This is a history book on memorizing techniques. The author wants his readers to indirectly believe that after critically reading his book you will know how to remember everything. He does state in the preface of the book that it is not a self-help book. But the cover of the book says otherwise. In any case, if you know how the greeks memorize their speeches, and the history about mnemonics, then this is your book.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|I have several cds by this artist, but was very pleased with this purchase.It had several cuts I hadn't heard before, and as usual, she is fantastic!!!
B000AARKOO|5.0|This is a movie about a battle over Jerusalem, seeking forgiveness, doing good versus evil, God's will, and figuring out and fighting for what really matters. This film did not follow a predictable formula in either the relationships or the storyline. Strong performances by Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Jeremy Irons, and Liam Neeson. Edward Norton is great in a small role somehow managing to express deep emotion and passion from behind a mask. Despite being extremely violent, I found this to be a good, but not typical, Easter-season movie for reflecting on religion versus holiness.<br /><br />Make sure to buy or rent the 193 minute director's cut!! And not the 143 minute version that was released in theaters. The longer version was what was originally intended and a much higher quality and critically acclaimed film. The short version cuts some key scenes including the resolution between Balian and Guy.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|Just to clarify I watched this film on cable it was uncut so I was able to see the film in its original state, now let me just say I loved the original karate kid films and I thought this revamp was going to be awful like most remakes tend to be, but I was wrong this remake was very entertaining    Why did I think this film version was good? well there was more karate in this version then in the original films. the martial arts in this redo was fast and fun to watch it just looked much better, I mean much more fancy, no cheesy easy one legged kick win, I mean sure there was the one legged kick win in the this film, but it looked cooler also I liked that the film was set in china and I've always enjoyed Jackie Chen's work, and Jaden smith was actually a good little actor, I also liked the fact that they showed more of the boys relationship with his mother because in the original films they hardly ever showed his mother it almost seemed like his mother did not exist I know that the story is about the boys journey, but it adds a touch of realism to show the young character interacting with his mother, and the training scenes was fun to watch because they were humerus and cool looking I would not mind seeing a sequel to this remake if they do one.
B001NERPHS|4.0|Great music, excellent sound, Dylan and the Band were a great team, so easy to listen to and enjoy.  Question is why on earth didn't Columbia put the whole lot on one CD - it would have fitted - so that we could hear the whole session more conveniently, rather than reproduce the original 2LP format?  Lose one star for that.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|FUN FUN FUN!!!    There is a new level each month.  I can't wait to see what's next!
B004FGMV0W|5.0|now let me just say that i love both mature and immature (as most say) avril after i heard what the hell (which i love) i expected to hear an album that sounded like the best damn thing (which i aalot differnt flso loved) but this album is..very mature and alot different from most of her stuff there is only one other song that is similar to what the hell the album is truly great i wouldnt expect anything less from her.
B004MPESSY|5.0|The point of the film was not to condone the pornographic, carnal, rapist nature of mankind. I can understand an argument for not filling your mind with events like these but you really need to understand the intent of the film. The sort of behavior that the rapists portray is a very real and prevalent attitude in men in our society, even if it is not acted out, it all starts in mind (Matthew 5:28). If anything this movie would cure anyone from ever letting the thought of rape enter their minds after seeing how evil the crime is. While the act was realistic, it was portrayed in a way that no one could watch the first half of this movie for pleasure.    To make another point, the sheer, brutal, vengeance and retribution that follow in the second half would not be understood or appreciated if the first half were not witnessed.    In regards to the film itself, it has very good acting, storyline, etc. I was impressed once again with the way that it portrayed the events realistically yet without irreverence toward the female victim, and then got down to business when it came to bringing justice as it could only be brought to the criminals involved, cruel torturous ends. This movie is ultimately about vengeance, not enjoying heinous acts of rape. So if you think you only want to watch this for some cheap erotic thrill, guess again.
B00009AQMJ|5.0|Beautiful warm sound that belies its age and hot-blooded performances.  What more could you want. Remasters are better than the Chesky ones which have had the warmth removed due to over-zealous attention to detail.
0670022411|5.0|I wasn't sure about this book to begin with.  But after the first chapter I was hooked.  I read it way too quick and didn't want it to end.  Is their going to be a sequel?  So many questions have been left unaswered.  Loved the characters.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Tron Legacy was amazing. I originally saw the film 3 times at the largest IMAX theater in America at the 21st Street Warren Theater in Wichita, Ks. It was worth all the money that I paid to see it 3 times and then some. I recommend the 3D version if you have a 3D capable TV or computer.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Excellent film, and I'm usually skeptical of any animation that isn't Pixar. Wish I would have seen this one in 3D at the theater when it came out.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Better visuals and upgrades are good, but the absence of the green pigs and other changes to the original formula make the game feel cheaper.  however, if u love angry birds, you'll like this game.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|What could make an already great movie better. An awesome case. The case comes with a slip over cover which is the featured cover on purchase. When you remove the cover it reveals the characters in their human form instead of their avatars. The reverse poster cover looks great as well. The dvds look quite attractive as well. Featured film dvd is a cute panda on a plaid blue dvd. The extras is a toony girl with cheetah ears and a tail on plaid red. It all looks great with the clear case looking through to the reverse cover poster.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love the app. The only two things I would really want that it doesn't have are page numbers and two-column view. I have a non-Honeycomb tablet and would like the option to use a two-column view when in landscape mode like in Kindle for iPad or Nook for Android. I'd also like the option to see real page numbers like in the iOS apps, as I need to record my reading for school and converting from percentage to actual pages can be annoying.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|When I first heard \\"Sail\\" played on the radio I immediately raced to my computer to find more Awolnation. Honestly I was dissapointed to only find an EP. So I waited and waited. When I found out that Megalithic Symphony was released I immediately jumped on it and bought it. I really was expecting music that sounded a lot like Sail. What I found instead was a collection of music that had it's own unique sound for each track. They sound so great, and yet one could easily peg each song as an Awolnation track, if they knew who they were. That is how well this album was done. \\"All I Need\\" is my personal favorite from them. It is just so much more different from everything else they sing, and it really accompanies the album so well. I hope to see a lot more quality tracks from Awolnation in the future.
B003UESJHO|5.0|His performance is AMAZING and worth watching the film for. What absolutely brillaint acting.    I didn't think Mark Wahlberg was great at all or Amy Adams. But Christian Bale makes it a movie worth watching.
B004K8WJ3Y|5.0|The first few things I heard earlier this year about this then new and upcoming Whitesnake album weren't giving me a whole lot to be excited about. I read about how this new album would be composed of mostly ballads and how it wasn't all that good. Well I whoever wrote that must not have listened to the same album I did because 1) The album is mostly rockers and there aren't a very big number of ballads and 2) its as good as anything the band has ever put out and more (listen to the samples if you don't believe me). The number of pre-orders in the UK for Forevermore exceeded those of the new Britney Spears album and Classic Rock Magazine has released a \\"SnakePack\\" which includes the new album.<br /><br />From the very first song, \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\", you have a good idea of the sound the band is going for with this album. This song is amazing, the great dirty blues sound is very present: the dirty riff, Coverdale's vocals and harmonicas, all rock'n'roll style with the \\"I Want It All, I Want It Now\\" chorus attitude make this a killer. I had to repeat it a few times before I could even get to the next track! \\"All Out of Luck\\" is a little heavier, an excellent rocker what can I say, nice chorus as well. \\"Easier Said Than Done\\" is what I'd call a feel-good ballad, very laid back but it is obviously carried by the guitars and not pianos as is usual. I very much like this ballad; it got me right from the beginning with that cool slow guitar intro. \\"I Need You (Shine A Light)\\" is simple and very effective rock, a catchy song.  \\"Tell Me How\\" is in the same line as the previous song, in which Coverdale asks the eternal question: \\"How can I win you love?\\".  \\"Love And Treat Me Right\\" is a bit predictable and cheesy when it comes to lyrics but it all works and is terrific rock really, one of my favorite songs here, try not to sing to that typically 1980's chorus! \\"One of These Days\\" is another great ballad, well more of a feel-good radio song that makes everything a little better just by the comforting sound of the acoustic guitars and honest lyrics. \\"Whipping Boy Blues\\" is filled with bad boy attitude as the title suggest. When the songs kicks in with the heavy and crunchy guitars and David screams his way through like a pro, you know you're in for one killer track and it's one of the highlights of the album for sure. Just when you think it's over the title track surprises the listener by being an unpredictably highly melodic, touching song. Incredible performance and powerful lyrics, after 3 minutes the songs shifts to a heavy perspective and never lets you go, fantastic guitar work. I nominate this one of the best song Whitesnake has ever done, no wonder this song ended up being the title of the album.<br /><br />David Coverdale sounds amazing for a guy pushing 60; I mean he can still sing quite well and not many rock singers compete with him as far as I'm concerned. Give the guy a break, his voice sounds excellent even if it does sound a bit rough in some parts but Coverdale still has it, there is no doubt! The new `Snakes bassist Michael Devin and former Billy Idol drummer Brian Tichy are proving here to be a very tight rhythmic section (how about that cowbell eh?), this will surely make for a great live lineup. Doug Aldrich and Reb Beach are excellent guitarists and they prove why once again, they do what needs to be done and then more.<br /><br />It's quite simple; the more I listen to Forevermore, the more I like it! It's still very early in 2011 to decide the best albums of the year but I have a feeling this one will end up being in the top releases. In comparison to the previous album Good To Be Bad which was a lot more 80's oriented (Think of 1984's Slide It In and 1987's Whitesnake), Forevermore goes for a bluesy rock sound of their earlier sounds from the late 70's and early 80's. Good To Be Bad was a great album and it was great to have Whitesnake back with a classic sound but I think Forevermore is even better. To me this new Whitesnake album is everything the band is, it's just dirty-blues rock fun time, nothing complicated, just pure rock you know? There is definitely a difference in sound if you compare with the last album. But Forevermore doesn't just merely go back to the sound of a certain era, it updates the sound to the current year and you get value for your money. I'm one of those who still buy many CDs and these days few of the new albums (either by classic or new bands) thrill me and Forevermore is one of those few. If you've ever been a fan of Whitesnake or simply like the band OR if you're maybe looking to get into the band, Forevermore is an excellent album that both fans of the band and rock music can enjoy.is everything the band is, it's just dirty-blues rock fun time, nothing complicated, just pure rock you know?

B0007TKNCY|1.0|That this movie is rated among the  AFI top 100 films is bizarre and I think a reflex reaction.  Great actors,  great director,  great concept...must be a great film......   Wrong.  The movie misses on all levels.  Direction is terrible...Hepburn (and I'm a big fan) is beyond annoying in this role..  She has one speed...irritating.. braying..  Grant, to his credit, gives it his best, but it's useless..     I defy anyone to actually watch this from start to finish and tell me it's any good at all let alone one of the best ever..
B0030IIYYS|5.0|My 2 kids like this more than the original one [[ASIN:B0030IIZ4M Toy Story]] and that's not to take anything away from that one. This movie makes life easier as a parent. Get it. You won't be disappointed.
1401324029|5.0|Usually I find series books to lack the content, excitement and mystery of the original release but in the case of the \\"Heat\\" books, I was delighted to find the second book every bit as good as Heat Wave.  The continued relationship with Nikki and Jamie was great.  The crime solving exciting, not at all boring and the plot was great.  I hope there are more Castle books in the works.
B004G6009K|5.0|Tangled is amazing, really enjoyed it. Picture quality is unreal. It's for all ages young or old you will fall for the story and stay in love for long. It actually had some twists I didn't expect. Truly one of the best, thank you Disney for another worthy and amazing animated film!!
0061733199|5.0|I travel extensively, sometimes to relatively inhospitable places, and after a few close calls, I've started paying attention to being more prepared. I'm a private pilot, and I do a lot of flying in small single engine airplanes over questionable terrain. These days, when I travel to remote parts of the world, I take along a variety of essential survival equipment - and one of the things that's made the biggest impact is this excellent book.     As you thumb through the book in the safety of your home, you realize that a lot of what the author describes is fairly straightforward and common sense. The next time you read it, you start thinking of ways you might embellish the techniques in the book, and slowly you develop perhaps a bit more respect for all the things that can happen out there - and perhaps a bit more confidence that you can handle most of what's likely to come your way.     For me, this is the big thing I got from the book...not so much any single technique or advice, but more a sense that whatever happens, at least I have some awareness of the resources at my disposal. This makes all the difference in any sort of uneasy situation.     Definitely recommended.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I've downloaded Soundhound and Shazam at the same time to check which is better. Checked the tune from new Adidas commercial. Shazam give me that it is the song by Justice and Soundhound said it can't recognize this song ... since that Shazam only!
1401310400|5.0|Love this book.  It's so much fun, especially after becoming such a huge Castle fan.  I really like the way the book is written. The crime solving and the chemistry between Nikki and Jamie is \\"hot\\". I'd like to see the TV characters have this much chemistry. Terrific book.  I really enjoyed it.
B0034GK7DM|5.0|i never heard of easton before his song, under this old hat, hit the radio.  i love the deep, sultry, very country sound of his voice.  i like the entire cd.  this cd is a keeper and i'll be back for more of easton.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love the awesome new graphics and the slight twist on the game play.   My wife already beat the available levels and is anxious for updates.
B004NSULHM|3.0|If there's a record where Radiohead can lay back a little bit to enjoy themselves and come up with an album to release just for the fun of it.. \\"The king of limbs\\" is the album to talk about. It seems that this time Thom Yorke and company decided to take things easy and relax by making some kind of fun/electro album with the Radiohead touch. It's laughable to see how many fans are jumping out of their chairs to make severe criticism on it just because TKOL does not have shape to talk about nor a clear point to understand. To me, this is exactly what happened when \\"Kid A\\" was released back in 2000. But this is not a bad album at all. Tracks like \\"Bloom\\" and \\"Feral\\" will remind you to something Radiohead has done already since the era of \\"KID A/AMNESIAC\\" (a lot of samplers going on everywhere without following any path for sure). On the other hand \\"Morning Mr. Magpie\\". \\"Little by little\\", and \\"Lotus flower\\" (the main track of the album if you ask me) could easily be reflected as the new Radiohead we all know since \\"Hail to the thief\\" and \\"In rainbows\\"... they don't care of playing electric guitars anymore but they somehow try to look for new ways to play a bass or a guitar in every track they can come up with. Listen carefully to \\"Lotus flower\\" and you'll know what I'm talking about. The song I might have problems with is \\"Giving up the ghost\\" is way too slow to enjoy even in the Radiohead terms, I mean, this one is not \\"No surprises\\" (Ok computer-1997) at all. On the other hand a great song in this album next to \\"Lotus flower\\" is \\"Separator\\". Again, this track is played as we see Radiohead turning into a different form in its metamorphosis and fortunely this one really works out.<br /><br />This is a 3 star album just because I could see that Thom Yorke and John Greenwood could easily placed a couple more tracks to make 10 to have in the album but somehow they felt comfortable with just these 8 tracks (I could live without \\"Giving up the ghost\\" and leave it in 7 but then this should be called an EP). What I hope is that \\"TKOL\\" becomes just a preview for something bigger and wider they're planning to do (mmm.. maybe a double album?)s should be called an EP).

1932100660|4.0|Dr Campbell is purported to be a saintly genius and benefactor of mankind or a raving vegan with an agenda, or something between. 2 things strike me after reading the book and a number of reviews: 1) He was at first convinced that promoting a diet with more meat and dairy products was the best thing he could do for mankind. When he saw harm being done he changed his own diet. 2) He says try it. What can be more convincing than that.  My husband and I spent a summer using up the meat and dairy and the next month eating none (okay, I cheated and had Cheetos twice)  By the end of the month I was definitely feeling better. The month after that my son had surgery,I'd eaten the last can of vegan soup at the Ronald McDonald house and it was so easy to slip back.       I enjoyed the book and the reviews. Dr. C. has convinced me to give it another shot.  If I had to choose just one book on the topic I would go with a good cookbook like Robin Robertson's Vegan Planet which has really tasty recipes.     [[ASIN:1558322116 Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World]]
B004Q08BE2|5.0|This movie was nothing expected and beautiful in so many ways. Natalie Portman was absolutely perfect for this role and she gave an Oscar winning performance that I am sure will be one of history's finest.
1416914293|3.0|The first book of this trilogy suffered from frequent info dumps, and under-developed main characters.  Here, both issues are improved upon (but not eliminated); however, the entire book was overshadowed by the \\"forbidden love\\" angst between Jace and Clary.  This issue could have been better managed as a dramatic device, if it weren't so obvious it would be resolved, and if Jace and Clary had tackled the issue head-on instead of moping. That said, this book was better since the world is expanded upon, the villain is given more screen time to evolve past the boogeyman stage, and Simon becomes a real contender in the plot.<br /><br />I think the strongest parts of this volume are with Valentine.  He is finally shown to be more than just the villain - he's a dangerous, charming, intelligent fanatic convinced of his own right cause.  Valentine is also the catalyst for some character development for Jace.  We can see the hints of the man he could be.  Sadly, that is not the case for Clary.  Other reviewers have pointed out that she is too passive, and when she does act it's with the impetuousness of a child.  That would be acceptable given her age, if not for the events beforehand.  Tragedy and danger should have pushed her to grow up more than she has.  The biggest change is for Simon, quite literally, and his transformation impacts the plot and other characters.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this more than book one and will finish the trilogy, but oh how I wish the author would do more with what she has.  Alec and Magnus could be more than just after-thoughts and Izzy has nothing to do.
B003ITDN86|3.0|Let me start off with this- Sum 41 has changed a lot, and i mean a lot, since their formation. This album exemplifies that. Some of the songs on this album are flat out cool, or just plain epic. But some of the songs will leave you wondering \\"Did they try to change too much?\\"    1. Reason to Believe- CHUCK! This song picks up right where Chuck leaves off. EPIC. Best on the album. 9.7/10    2. Screaming Bloody Murder- This song is one of those good, but not great ones. It's got a cool intro and when the drums and guitar kick in it's like, \\"whoa!\\" however, lyrically this song is not great. \\"God will set you up to bleed and no one can deceive, what is meant to be a bloody murder we will scream.\\"... what kind of lyric is that? it really just doesn't make sense. Disappointing. The solo disappoints as well, and w/ill leave you wishing Dave Baksh was still the guitarist. 7.8/10    3. Skumfuk- Let me tell you straight out, the intro to this song is 'knock you on your @$$' good. The intro brings this song a whole number value up, from about a 7.9 to an 8.9/10. I only wish the rest of the song was like the intro, or it'd be a ten! 8.9/10    4. Time For You to Go- What are you, Green Day? This isn't a bad song necessarily, but it does not fit with the album at all and should've been a B-Side or should've been left in the trash, never to make the cut for the record. 5.9/10    5.Jessica Kill- Dark, heavy, catchy, this song will most likely not hit you as one of the best on the album at first, but it will definitely grow on you. 9/10    6. What Am I To Say- This song is almost a duplication of 'With Me' from Underclass Hero, yet I still find myself enjoying it. With Me was amazing, and while this does not quite amaze me like With Me did, it is still a great love ballad. 8.6/10    7. Holy Image of Lies- This is a very interesting song. It switches up through many different styles and while it could use some fix-ups to make it perfect, it's still a pretty darn good song. Again though, the lyrics are not great 8.3/10    8. Sick of Everyone- I'm stuck in the middle on this one... Too straightforward for me... Something's just not right about it. 7/10    9. Happiness Machine- I really like this song, how it transitions from dark to light and over again. It's got a neat tone and feel to it. One of the better ones on the album. 8.4/10    10. Crash- This song is pretty sad. All piano and vocals, pretty much. However the chorus is not as good as it could be, the chord progression changes into a kind of awkward feel. The lyrics, again, are good but not great. Deryck really should have gone through his lyrics on this one. Had the chorus's chord progression been changed, as well as a few of the lyrics, this would be a 10. But it isn't. 8/10    11. Blood In My Eyes- Pretty cool song, switches styles often. 8/10    12. Baby You Don't Wanna Know- Return of the Green Day wannabes, sadly. Get this off the record. 6/10    13. Back Where I Belong- This is a pretty good song, but still not great. 8/10    14. Exit Song- Don't know if I like the lyrics too much, and this isn't a great way to end an album that's defined by dark and heavy songs. 7.3/10    Overall this album isn't great, and Sum 41 definitely hasn't put out its best work. But while you may be disappointed, the songs will grow on you and the overall effect will be positive.   Good, but not great. Overall, the album gets a 7.5/10

B004PIKPTY|5.0|I recently got a chance to sit down and play with the Tt eSPORTS Shock ONE headset, and I was definitely impressed.  The headset was very comfortable, but it wasn't so loose that it shifted and moved around my head as I myself would move my head.  The USB plug and play is great (especially if you're like me and you like to go to competitive tournaments), and the fact that you can collapse it down and fit it into an included pouch makes it a huge plus for traveling.    The sound quality is amazing, and Tt eSPORTS did an awesome job licensing the DTS 5.1 surround sound because when I'm in game, I can hear footsteps, gun sounds and even ambient noise whirling around me.  The included drivers even make it easier because they offer special gaming 'presets' to adjust the EQ to a specific genre of game you're playing (FPS, RTS, MMO).  With that feature, I found that even the faintest footsteps can be heard on the \\"FPS\\" preset because the EQ was adjusted to tailor towards those mid-range sounds.  Other presets included tailor to all different kids of genres of music, and the DTS 5.1 includes bass enhancement for music and another theater-like setting for movie watchers.    My only complaint is that the faux-leather ear cups that come on the headset don't have the best quality, but they're great for noise isolation when I'm in a noisy area (such as a LAN tournament).  Thankfully though, Tt eSPORTS included a set of cloth ear pads (the ear pads on the Shock ONE are replaceable) so I just popped those on and went for an enthusiastic sound ride.    I would definitely recommend this headset to gamers, especially competitive gamers who frequently attend LAN tournaments: the 5.1 surround sound is better than any USB headset I have ever used and the included driver HQ settings bring out the best in each game.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|I can finally play again!  I could not play angry birds on my Samsung Moment, I suspect it has to do with the streaming in game advertisement bar, because AB- Seasons would play great, until the Valentine's Day update which rendered it unplayable in much the same way.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Rovio outdid itself and came out with another great game in the Angry Bird series!   Saving birds and fighting lemurs (hope I get tt right) is a refreshing change. Game difficulty is not high, but that's what Angry Bird should be like: for casual gamers.
0525423273|5.0|This novel was the first I'd read in a while and it more than exceeded my expectations. Don't be fooled by the cover and title that nearly put me off (Sorry! I know, not supposed to do that)  It was just so well written, easy to read, romantic, funny and what was nice is that there were no cover-ups like in other teenage novels.. where in which the teenagers don't swear or drink without being excessive either.   I both laughed and happy-cried my way through this book and would encourage especially older teenagers not to pass it off like I nearly did. It was a brilliant read and whenever there's a day when I want a bit of Etienne St. Claire I'll know where to find it.
1416511946|5.0|I had a problem with drugs years ago. I have been clean since 1-11-97 and it has been a hard road to stay on. I read this book and saw so many familiar things I too had lived, except I wasn't a rock star in a mansion in Van Nuys. I recommend this book to addicts along with recovering addicts, I especially recommend this book to addicts who are Motley Crue fans.<br />It will open your eyes and show you the hell of addiction and the joy of recovery. You also get some tasty behind the scenes, candid stories about Nikki, Motley Crue and the players in his times of addiction hell.<br />It has also helped me personally as a reminder every time I want to say to hell with it and do more drugs. It has saved me.[[ASIN:1416511946 The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star]]
0151013837|2.0|This book came highly recommended, but was for the most part a letdown. The first one-fifth or so of the book was so boring that I put it aside for a year and then picked it up later after I was told that, yeah, the beginning is boring but you have to push through because it's such an amazing book. Most of the rest of the book is relatively more readable, but there was a lot of tedious technical description that I don't really want to spend my time on in fiction. I kept wondering \\"when is the payoff for all this?\\" Finally in the last 50 pages you do get to the payoff, and it is okay, but not so great that it redeems the previous 350 pages. In summary, 90% of the book is an overly-elaborate setup for a \\"punchline\\" that is somewhat interesting, but by no means mind-blowing.

B004LFO0ME|3.0|Definitly not worth 5 stars as some people on here are giving it.Out of the 14 songs i like 7 of them.This album just seems too pop for me.If that's what you are into then you may like it,but as a hip-hop album I'm not really feeling it.I think the hype surrounding Black and Yellow may have raised everybody's expectations for Wiz.This album definitly did not meet mine.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|I LOVED this movie!  I have actually seen it five times.  I actually caught this movie on accident.  I was visiting my sister and her kids were so engrossed that I could not help but be drawn in.  It is interesting how films can teach us so much about life and unconditional love, even when it is wrapped in being the greatest villain.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This is by far my favorite album (so far) of 2011. The songs are always on repeat and I can't wait for their second album! :)
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Blues/Rock master Joe Bonamassa's latest release \\"Dust Bowl\\" could very well be his best release to date. Joe is probably one of music's hardest working musicians. He plays roughly 250 shows a year and still finds the time to record an amazing CD. From the opening track \\"Slow Train\\" to the final track \\"Prisoner\\" this is an outstanding album. This time around he gets some help from some of music's most respected artists; Folk's John Hiatt on \\"Tennessee Plates\\" Black Country Communion band mate Glenn Hughes on \\"Heartbreaker\\" and Country's Vince Gill joins him on \\"Sweet Rowena\\". My favorite tracks are the title track \\"Dust Bowl\\" and \\"Black Lung Heartache\\". His guitar playing is just phenominal. I'd really have to say Joe really knocked it out of the park with this release. He proves time and time again why he's one of the best Blues/Rock artists in the business.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I've bought several MP3's over the years from Amazon, and they are not \\"grandfathered in\\". I can upload them into the cloud, but they count against my quota. Also, I can't upload my MP3 collection directly from the phone to the cloud, which is unfortunate.
B004NSULHM|1.0|Sounds like an EP of B-sides... only 8 songs, all of them under-developed and uninteresting. I love Radiohead, but this is as bad as Amnesiac. If you liked Amnesiac, you'll still feel ripped-off if you buy this! What a let down after In Rainbows.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Britney Spears (Britney Spears), last years involving so is a lot of attention to the person, at all hasn't forgotten that music for it nevertheless is much more important than high ratings in a press. Whatever wrote about it in tabloids, for millions listeners it was and remains the present pop star. From the moment of an exit of its first studio works has passed more than ten years during which Britney's image changed, and musical reference points of the singer have undergone considerable changes. It is literally at once after the first releases numerous critics have declared that Spears applies for a rank of the brightest singer of the twenty first century, and as has shown time, they have appeared are right. \\". Baby One More Time\\", \\"Oops!... I Did It Again\\" and other plates of the performer dispersed in million circulations - than not the success and recognition proof? So, in 2011 the long-awaited release of the seventh studio work of Britney who have received the name \\"Femme Fatale\\" has taken place.     And again traditionally high level   In 2009 work over \\"Femme Fatale\\" has begun to boil, and Britney repeatedly declared in interview that it has really enclosed soul in this album. However, fans and will understand it, having familiarized with new creation of the singer. Sounding - here at what Spears has worked wonderfully well. She wanted to make something absolutely new, excellent not only from previous \\"Circus\\", but also from everything that other musicians now create. So, the first track of an album, \\"Till The World Ends\\", represents at once to listeners fresh sounding in all beauty. Juicy, class arrangements ideally are in harmony with Britney's vocal. Its voice all as is unique, and the singing manner, so fallen in love to fans of the performer, hasn't disappeared anywhere. On \\"Femme Fatale\\" Britney has given vent to imagination, and musical experiments which always were pleasant to the singer, have really gone right. The original composition \\"How I Roll\\" has occupied one of key positions on an album that absolutely it is no wonder, after all such sound is difficult for disregarding. Of course, the musical scent hasn't brought Britney and this time, and the command of professionals with which she worked over \\"Femme Fatale\\", has helped to embody all ideas in a reality. It is possible to assert safely that here you won't find compositions through passage: \\"Trouble For Me\\", \\"Trip To Your Heart\\" and other songs won't allow to doubt it for a second.    \\"Femme Fatale\\" as the new standard of quality  Music has property constantly to change, following not that to a fashion, not that to a freakish trajectory of evolution. At Britney Spears there is an amazing property sensitively to catch all these new trends, however the singer isn't arranged at all under them. Its ideas in a combination to desire to create something new and unusual and so yield tremendous results. The actual, fresh and vigorous sound \\"Femme Fatale\\", undoubtedly, is necessary to taste to music fans all over the world. And differently be simple can't, after all Britney has enclosed so much forces in this plate! Spears has done enormous work, creating improbable atmosphere \\"Femme Fatale\\", and as a result at it very strong plate with the compositions not similar against each other but which, nevertheless, make very integral album has turned out.
B00288KNL8|5.0|I was a little appalled in the beginning of the movie with all the cutting up and poppin eyeballs and sewing buttons for eyes etc, and I thought it would be kind of scary for my daughter. but it turned out to such a great movie, and my daughter isn't scared of it not one bit. Loved it.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|Imelda May has a voice that jumps out of the speakers at you.  Whether its a sassy rockabilly-tinged foot-stomper or a torchy ballad, May, along with her band lead by her husband, a smoking-hot guitar grinder, spans generations and genres with ease.
B004NSULHM|1.0|I'm tired of people praising radiohead. They should write some songs and quit acting like tortured artists. I can make noodles too but no one would care or listen.

B004LGPBZI|2.0|I was and still am a HUGE Oasis fan and this album confirms that Noel was the brains behind all those great songs.  This album is BAD.  I like \\"Call me the Roller\\" but that's about it.  I look forward to the release of Noel's solo album.
B004NSULHM|3.0|I actually wanted to give this three and a half stars, but that's not available, and I couldn't quite make it to four stars, so here we are.  This is a good album, but not their best by far.  I don't want to be one of those reviewers who compares a band's new works to their old classics, but when you've set the bar so high, it's hard not to.  There's no real grabbers here - it sounds like a B-sides album.  I'd say it sounds experimental, but this is what Radiohead has been doing their entire career.  It just sounds like them.  Now everyone who goes out on a limb is compared to these guys.  Their very best, in order and in my opinion are OK Computer, The Bends, and Kid A and In Rainbows are tied.  This ranks right around Amnesiac range.  In fact, it sounds like a sequel.  Early favorites are Codex, Little By Little and Morning Mr. Magpie.  Not an instant classic like prior works, but steady and interesting.
0817439390|5.0|This is the best, easiest to understand book on photography that I've ever read.  After reading a chapter I was able to take my camera and go practice the technique.  The light triangle of ISO, aperture, and shutter speed were suddenly made clear to me.  If you want to understand exposure, get this book!

B002LU3BLC|5.0|Anyone that's familiar with MFSL and this title already know. If you have a decent turntable rig, this is a must have for any vinyl geek and Rush fan. The 180g MoFi pressing absolutely rocks. Great tunes from start to finish and this album really pulls you in to the experience. It's almost like being in the studio with Geddy, Alex and Neil. Pure analog warmth. Mobile Fidelity does it again. Highly recommended.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|The original Star Wars w/o the bogus CGI blue screened scenes, music changes, crappy animation will not cut it.  Sorry, until the theatrical versions are released on blu ray, no sale!  Thank goodness I still have the standard dvd version, better than the alternative.
B004SS0884|3.0|This CD, from the demo's I've heard, sounds like the same thing over and over. \\"Criminal\\" seems a little different, having actual words written in the song.<br />They sound the same as all of the songs on the radio. Nothing special. They would be good for a dance party, but back to all of the songs on the radio. \\"Till the World Ends\\" sounds like a mix of \\"We R Who We R\\" and \\"Blow\\" (both by Ke$ha), as do most of the songs (from what I've heard). I personally won't buy the whole CD, but I might buy songs like \\"Criminal\\", that you can listen to without the drums or technolegy getting too crazy in your headphones. If you like technolegy(a lot), you will probably like this.
061891868X|5.0|Riviting, reads like a thriller.  A veritable who'dunn'it. Keeps you continually wondering how it will end.  With the death of string theory?  The idictment of quantum mechanics?  Can relativity escape unscathed?  Though the jury is still out, the verdict is eagerly anticipated by physicist like myself.  I'm Charles Panati, Columbia University physicist and former Science Editor of Newsweek.  I think Lee Smolin has written a spellbinding book.  He's a born story teller.
B0033AI4CK|5.0|The good old original is still a great movie, this bluray puts the icing on the cake! The colours are impressive for such an old movie you would think it was short recently. If I am to criticise anything it has to be the blacks which seemed a bit washed out.

B004G6009U|3.0|\\"Tangled\\" has all the elements of a classic Walt Disney animated feature.  Young beautiful princess locked away in a tower.  Evil mother figure who uses the girl for her own vain, corrupt purposes and a lot of animals with quirky personalities.  A slight difference this time around is the man that the girl is supposed to fall in love with isn't of high estate.  Nope, he's a thief and while on the lamb he meets Rapunzel.  The film is nice to watch but there is really nothing in it that sticks in the memory banks like scenes from past classics such as \\"The Little Mermaid\\" or \\"Beauty and the Beast\\".   The songs are decent but forgettable.  And speaking of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" there is a scene towards the climax which looks like it was directly lifted from the \\"Kiss The Girls\\" scene.    They say a Disney movie, much like James Bond movies, is only as good or as bad as it's villain.  Mother Grothel is in this story for no other reason than the story needs a villain.  Much like Frolo from \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\", Mother Grothel convinces Rapunzel that the world is an evil place and keeps her locked up in a tower for her own good.  In the opening scenes of \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\", we see how horrifying Frolo is, trying to throw a baby into a well and all.  We accept Mother Grothel is the villain because the narrator has explained that is who she is.      Disney has been consistent with that quality of their blu ray disc pretty much since they started marketing them a few years back  . I am happy to say that \\"Tangled\\" measures up to previous standards in the tech areas.  Even though I think \\"Tangled\\" is amusing and is worth watching, it's by no means a classic.
0385737955|5.0|I just finished reading The Maze Runner by James Dashner and now can't wait to read the next two books in this trilogy:  The [[ASIN:0385738757 The Scorch Trials (Maze Runner Trilogy, Book 2)]] and [[ASIN:0385738773 The Death Cure (Maze Runner Trilogy)]].  I loved The Maze Runner!  Thomas, with memories of his life gone, is mysteriously transported to the Glade where only boys live.  The boys all have assigned jobs, the most prestigious of which is the maze runners who go out every day into the surrounding maze in search of a way out.  The boys have been there for two years and Thomas arrives with the ambition of being a maze runner and finding a way back.  Thomas is smart, kind, compassionate, courageous and likeable.  When a girl arrives just two days later, things start to change and the end is near!<br /><br />This teen science fiction novel is full of adventure, suspense, mystery but also interesting characters involving leadership, friendship and perseverance issues.  I liked the way the kids worked together to help each other.  It held my interest from the start.  It's a far out story I found captivating and entertaining.  I would describe The Maze Runner as a cross between [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] (in that it takes place after a world catastrophe and kids are placed in a strange place and observed and manipulated by the creators) and [[ASIN:0399529209 Lord of the Flies (50th Anniversary Edition)]] (in that the kids are on their own and have to run their own community).  If you like science fiction, adventure, mystery and stories about teens, I recommend this book!  It's great!
0670022411|3.0|This book (and the ones to follow) has great potential. The main themes are good and interesting, history, alchemy, magic mixed with witches, vampires, daemons et al. This book however, suffered from lack of editing. As other reviewers have stated there is too much filler and not enough action. Too many instances or fainting, running hands thru hair, cold tingles, Matthew scooping up Diana because she is yet again going into shock. Diana's reactions seem extreme and even bordering on silly. She practically has to be hospitalized because she sees a picture that she has actually seen before, upsetting sure, but not to the extreme the author writes it. Her refusal to get help controlling her talents is irritating and makes me question her intelligence. She gets bathed, fed and bundled more than most infants and yet is supposed to be a highly intelligent adult. I will admit to skimming parts of the book, especially towards the end. It just takes too long to get to the end and once at the end, it is clear that this is just the first of a series of books as nothing is settled. This very long book is just a set up for another. I hope the next books allow Diana to behave with a little more pragmatism and a little less of the shrinking violet. Please no more fainting and going into shock!!! Hopefully she will use her head and her intelligence a little more to solve the book's mysteries. I want more of the history, alchemy and science and less of the fragile heroine and overbearing hero. Less lengthy descriptions of wine would be appreciated also.
0553288105|5.0|Issac Asimov stands with Heinlein at the top of the all time list of great sci-fi writers. Their styles were vastly different. Heinlein was more a teller of tales involving personalities. Asimov relied more on concept and crisp plots. His characters are seldom as emotional or engaging as Heinlein's, but his ideas are always invigorating. The analytical mind responsible for so many pure science non-fiction worked wonderfully to come up with carefully crafted, believable science fiction.<br /><br />In &#34;The Gods Themselves&#34; Asimov makes a shift well to the side of what most writers ever attempt. He makes a very good attempt to describe an alien society that is SO unlike our own as to truly be alien. Most alien societies attempted by fantasy or sci-fi writers make steps towards strangeness, but in the end have many similarities to our own because they are, in the end, written by one of our own. Asimov made a laudable attempt to step out of the mold and give us something truly alien, and he succeeded VERY well. This is a bit of a surprise, because unlike most sci-fi writers, Asimov's other novels are decidedly void of aliens.<br /><br />Here scientists on Earth discover a way to get &#34;free energy&#34; from a connection to another dimension. What they don't realize is that they are destroying that dimension, along with its inhabitants! When one of those inhabitants stumbles across what is happening, &#34;he&#34; meets disbelief and contention in his society, as do the scientists here when they learn the truth. However, the plot is secondary ... just a framework upon which to hang Asimov's true achievement in this book, the amazingly different aliens.<br /><br />As are many of Asimov's works, this is a thinking man's novel. There are a few one star reviews of this book. I hate to think what sort of defective intellect it takes to read &#34;The Gods Themselves&#34; and be bored. LOL This book is a marvelous springboard to thinking beyond the normal boundaries.<br /><br />It is a must read for all true science fiction fans./><br />It is a must read for all true science fiction fans.

B003YK42LQ|5.0|Don't get me wrong this is a great album and I have very much enjoyed listening to it.......but.......when I first heared Youth and Young Manhood and Aha Shake Heartbreak, I was moved.  I just love that raw and hard hitting sound from the boys earlier albums.  Sundown is a great album and you'll enjoy it, but I look forward to the day when they \\"throw down the rock gauntlet\\" again.
B002RV01QI|5.0|I bought this new Enya CD and was very happy with it as well as the way the Amazon transaction was handled.  Most excellent.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|Ok let's remember it's Britney we are talking about here. I am a big Britney fan and have been since the beginning. This cd is pretty much what I would expect from her. Juvenile lyrics that sometimes make me cringe seeing as how they are coming from a 29 year old. Sadly most of the Disney pop stars have more mature lyrics than Britney. This cd like all of her albums is auto tuned all over the place where at times it sounds like there is someone else singing altogether. I sure hope that people do not buy or listen to Britney's music expecting anything less. Her music is what it is and will never be serious or anything more than over worked pop tunes. She has never had the greatest singing voice that is why they have to do all the tricks to it. She has mostly gotten by on her image (which is screaming for help most of the time)and the fact she used to be entertaining. She now has lackluster performances and still lip syncs and always will.    This album for me is good and worth a listen if you are a fan. I did struggle with the fact of buying the regular or deluxe edition. The four extra tracks on the deluxe were not worth the extra money in my opinion and I am also disappointed with the crappy cd case itself.    I always find myself disappointed in the fact that every new album she puts out I hope for a more mature sound but she never delivers. So I just take it for what it is and try to enjoy it.    I do like the fact that she went in the direction of a dance album. I have been waiting for something like this ever since she did \\"And then we Kiss\\" for B in the remixes.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I read this largely based on the number of five star reviews.  I also read it because other reviews said that while it did fall into the \\"youth\\" or \\"young adult\\" genre, older adults would enjoy it too.  The concept of the story was entertaining enough, but as others have pointed out, pretty brutal, teenagers forced into a competition where they're forced to kill or be killed.  I did not, however, find the actual death passages to be overly grotesque.  Still, in my opinion this is definitely a book that will appeal much more to younger readers than more adult, mature readers.  While it was a well told story, I personally found the writing to be a bit simplistic, and doubt that I'll be reading the rest of the trilogy.
B00000K0T8|5.0|This LP is nuts. If you like hip hop and don't have this record then you don't really like hip hop ;)
B001CZVVW8|5.0|Tchaikovsky's opera \\"Eugene Onegin\\" was a pleasant surprise to me when I first encountered it. I was expecting a heavy Russian epic (along the lines of \\"Boris Godunov\\"), but instead it is romantic and very lyrical.     In this production from the Metropolitan Opera, Renée Fleming gives an outstanding performance as Tatiana, producing beautiful singing and touching acting throughout. Dmitri Hvorostovsky is equally appealing as Onegin, with his famous rich tone. And how touching it was to have the two of them interviewed at intermission by Beverly Sills herself!     The production is very different and extremely minimalist, with the stage frequently bare with the exception of one or two simple pieces of furniture. While some may prefer sets on the more extravagant side of things, I found that this minimalist approach allowed the characters themselves to blossom and become the center of our attention. The lighting design brought out some gorgeous colors, with a very effective sunrise after Tatiana's letter aria, and a cold morning for a chilling duel between Onegin and Lensky.     The video quality is crystal clear, though not quite at the exceptional level of many discs release by Opus Arte. The sound is simply stunning.     One of my favorite operas on blu-ray! I hope the Metropolitan Opera produces more.

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I loved this book!  I keep looking for more information on the book, the author, etc., etc. as I absolutely loved it.  The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 was because I did feel as if the ending got a little bit muddled once they were about ready to go time-walking.  I felt as if there was a huge influx of characters/explanations added that just seemed to kind of disrupt the flow of what was a BEAUTIFULLY written novel to that point.     I hope the author gets back to the storyline between Diana and Mathew in Book 2 because it's the story between those two that I find so intriguing.  Overall, I am actually considering re-reading this novel although I just finished it--I just loved it THAT much!
B004SBX112|5.0|This is sold due to lack of ads.  Anyone saying it's the same as android market place is mistaken.  Also to the person saying won't install on the droid incredible is also wrong. It works on mine.  His is just not working.  Don't blame the game.

I would recommend looking at book #3 \\"A Storm of Swords\\" because I am having to replace mine as a result of publisher error.  It is missing pages 561-592 and it has a double inclusion of pages 593-624.  Make sure that your book set doesn't have the same publisher error!  Otherwise, I am very happy with this purchase.
0670022411|5.0|Some of these fantasy books repeat the same usual topics that have absorb us readers over the last few years: vampires, magic, amazing powers. Just when I thought I was really tired of those topics, comes Mrs. Harkness with a researched approach. It becomes very clear from the start that she is actually a scientist and studious writer herself. We are taken into an amazing trip without insulting our intelligence but teaching us actual historical, poetical and cultural facts. Congratulations to Deborah Harkness for an incredibly successful first fictional novel. We will be anxiously waiting for the rest.
B000003RCY|4.0|The hammer blows of the German language are ideally suited to the melodramatic sturm and drang of heavy metal. In this idiom, brutal Teutonic voice and thundering ironfisted guitar are wed as two warring elements in some vast cosmic drama. It's as if whole continents were being shifted at their foundations or planets entire were being torn assunder by the implacable forces of nature. These are primal energies, the labors of gods as they defiantly and bravely war against an inscrutable fate. Here are the unspeakable horrors of the abyss, the keys to the gates of chaos, the mirror held up to Death's ghastly aspect. For these reasons, as well as others, Rammstein wield metal's power cosmic, the Excalibur of a sound forged in the Wagnerian fires of doom and destruction. They are the last of the valiant warriors to enter the heavy metal halls of Valhalla, following in their train Zeppelin, Sabbath, Purple, Priest and Metallica.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|so why did I give 1 star? because its not really streaming. It's downloading the entire song into a cache file.  So your music isn't really playing from the cloud.  This is why people are getting errors when they first try to play the song they just bought, because you have to wait for it to download! if they can switch this to real streaming, then I'll make this a 5 star!

030745455X|3.0|After having read The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo, I feel that perhaps Steig left himself searching along with his characters....<br /><br />I felt that this read was dissapointing and that nothing really came into being. I felt the story would have been alot shorter as there was allot of unnessesary babble.<br /><br />I am sure Steig created this book with the third book in mind and tended to keep his audience longing for it rather than concentrating on the book at hand. The character names become quite difficult to follow.<br /><br />All in all would recommend reading this, only because the third book is FANTASTIC and you need to push through the second to understand what's going on.<br /><br />(If you havn't read the first book- never fear- it's perfectly summarised here.....)

I LOVED reading this book because the writing is excellent and the plot was interesting and kept me longing for more.     I really was quite dissapointed, however, when the book was finished. This book was so exiting and such an easy read that kept me guessing and turning the pages to try uncover the plot that I ended up reading it too quickly. I loved the english and the discriptions and I do plan to re-visit Holmes and Watson and re-read it at some point just because it's so much fun to read. I found myself lost in the stories and good old England along with Holmes and Watson.     I also enjoyed the fact that the stories weren't connected and would often find my husband with his nose stuck in MY book because you could pick up the book and read any story you like and be ontop of all the goings on.    Charaters are true to form and enlightening and believable.    This book has left me hungry for more and I will definatelly download the whole selection....    Would recommend for anyone who wants an honest read without the violence and media hype we seem to get in allot of our literature today.    This is quite special and I am sure will not leave you feeling dissapointed, but rather clinging to your favorite armchair filled with intrigue.
B002BPQ0Y2|5.0|I can't say what has already been said. If your a Black Eyed Peas fan your going to enjoy this album.
0307454541|5.0|I loved reading this book....<br /><br />I enjoyed the plot, although it took me time to get into it. Once I got 100 or so pages in (I was advised by a friend to push through), I found the book most exciting and quite believable.<br /><br />True to the title of this review I feel the book has something for everyone. Sex, Murder, Mystery, Comedy, Travel and the most remarkable characters.<br /><br />I was definatelly transported into Blomkvist's world and felt his frustrations and really felt Steig communicated his characters in a cleaver and honest way.<br /><br />Would recommend this book and encourage it's readers to hang in, because once you are in, you will be hacked.... I mean hooked.
0793563836|5.0|Okay so this book is for almost absolute begginers. However saying that it also goes into more complex rythems and theroys and play technigues, like poping fingering fretting. It is nice that it helps teach the bass clef since I for one have always been treble. And it is nice for them to explain the timing and all for songs. All in all this is a great book.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|Within Temptation has the best record i've ever heard, they've outdone themselves this time. From the 1st song to the last song you will be blown away especially with the musicianship of the band and especially with Sharon(lead singer). She has the best voice i;ve ever heard, if you never heard of within temptation then by this album you be hooked there's no doubt about it. I like every album they've done but this is their best by far and every song is upbeat. So if your looking for a outstanding rock album with outstanding musicianship and vocals you've got to buy this you wont be disappointed. I guarantee it.

0756404738|1.0|The Wise Man's Fear is a very pedestrian effort. You could toss the whole book aside, go back to the end of book 1 and just add one sentence \\"and then Kvothe became a great lover and a skilled fighter and a mediocre caller of the wind\\". That's all you need to effectively summarize all of book 2.     It's baffling really. What is the author thinking? Not one significant plotline has moved forward to any meaningful degree.     This book would be better titled \\"Kingkiller Chronicles: Interlude. Random Adventures of Young Kvothe\\"
B004G6009K|5.0|Love Love Love this movie!!!! Couldn't ask for more then maybe it being classic animation but I love it anyway :)
1591843790|5.0|Enchantment is full of information on how to relate with people in such a way as to create success and great, lasting business relationships.  My favorite piece of advice out of many is on page 166 in Chapter 11, \\"How to Enchant Your Boss\\".  \\"Drop everything and do what your boss asks.\\" Chapter 3 is also full of fantastic suggestions.  The chapter works not only for developing new business relationships, but is also a great way to think about building new friendships.  Thanks for a great book, Guy!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Excellent reader - quick and responsive. Navigation is a breeze. Lots of ways to page through a book - swipe, tap, volume buttons, and a scroll bar at the bottom to go to a specific section quickly.  There's also the Go To page accessed through the Menu key through which you can jump to a specific section or to a passage you have marked. Love love love the WhisperSync - you can get access to the book you purchased wherever you are. You can highlight words and passages and create notes. Day and night display settings are available as well as setting the brightness.    There are two main drawbacks that keep me from giving it a full five stars - one is the limited number of sorting and view options. There's grid and list view, and sort by Author, Title, and Most Recent and that's it. I would like some way to create custom collections or bookshelves or even pages. I thought the PC version would be more complete, but sadly it isn't.  The other big drawback is the limited number of formats it supports natively. You may convert your other e-books to one of those formats, or if you have a Kindle, then you can send your books to be converted to your Kindle email and you'll get a reply with the attached books converted. It's not a huge huge deal, but it's just another encumbrance to enjoying your book right away.
B00393C47M|5.0|Moving to a new house can be scary unless you consider yourself an explorer, like Coraline, the main character in Neil Gaiman's book by the same name. Gaiman does a great job of describing both the creepy old house and the odd neighbors so that the reader is instantly drawn in to Coraline's curiosity. Coraline can't sit still for long, and when her mom and dad are too busy or too boring to play with her, she sets off to explore her new surroundings and meet her new neighbors. It doesn't take long for her to discover that this is not an ordinary house. When Coraline finds a mysterious door, the action begins, and an ordinary-seeming story quickly becomes more suspenseful. Coraline finds herself being chased by strange adults who call themselves her \\"other mother\\" and \\"other father,\\" as well as by twisted and creepy versions of the neighbors in her real house. The problem builds at a good pace and holds the reader's interest throughout the story without ever becoming overly scary or violent. This book will make a great addition to a classroom library because it is easy enough to be a \\"fun\\" book but well-written enough to learn writer's tools from. Gaiman's writing style is not only entertaining; he is a master of similes like this one: \\"She felt a cold hand touch her face, fingers running over it like the gentle beat of a moth's wings.\\" (p.83) Both boys and girls will enjoy exploring the mysterious \\"other\\" world that Gaiman has created.
B00319ECGU|5.0|The blu-ray pack is awesome.  It arrived right on time, and well packaged. As soon as I got it, I popped in Dirty Harry and loved it this time as much as the first time I saw it.  The film was made years ago, so don't expect the same quality as a modern blu-ray but still well worth the investment.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Great sound! Welcome back Britney :) My only regret is this CD wasn't created sooner. The drought is over and I'm dancing in the Reign Of Britney 2011. Thanks Britney.<br /><br />The best songs on the album are \\"Don't Keep Me Waiting\\", \\"Till The World Ends\\", \\"Hold It Against Me\\",\\"(Drop Dead) Beautiful feat. sabi, \\"I Wanna Go\\", \\"Trouble For Me\\" and \\"Trip to your Heart\\" in that order. This is not like the previous albums, BUT if I want to hear Blackout and Circus I'll listen to them. A great CD and very glad I have it. Good Luck Brit on your tour bring the house down.:)<br /><br />Your Fan for life,<br />Lonnie

B00004WPAE|3.0|Amazon has this listed as an album, but it came as a cd. Amazon needs to update the category for this product.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Having only played around with the new music player a little, I've been generally impressed. A couple tweaks and this would be my new default player. My biggest gripe is the lack of control from the lock screen. It takes way too many presses to skip a song- especially while driving. I wish holding the next/previous buttons would fast forward /rewind. My last complaint is needlessly specific, but I wish the widget showed cover art. The whole interface could be more exciting, but I don't mind the simplicity. The ability to store in the cloud is amazing, and it works great. That said, until I feel comfortable using it as my primary player, I won't have much use for it. I'm hoping amazon updates soon with the must-haves (and wouldn't hate to see the superficial stuff addressed either) Great start to what must be the future of how we listen to music!
B004FOJZXU|5.0|I've just received this boxset.<br />I don't regret buying it, because by chance I had thought to buy Inception Spinning Totem that is sold on Amazon. It's already included in this boxset.<br />Both BluRay discs can be played on my player (I live in Indonesia). And what makes me confused, DVD disc can also be played on the same player. Because I thought that my player is Region-3 for DVD.
B002ZG98C8|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm laughing at the usual level of \\"over the top\\" violence. However, when this is pared with lousy acting from folks who are obviously only in it for the money, AND a silly portrayal of some complex social issues, then this movie qualifies as inane and not worth more than the $1 rental I paid for it.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|Movie arrived within 4 days of my ordering it. This is an Excellent Seller. Will definitely do business thru amazon.com and from their own web site. Have ordered several items from this seller and have had no problems and even quicker service than expected.
B004SC7B6M|5.0|I actually have no real idea how to describe the excellence of this effort by Within Temptation.  It has to be one of the greatest musical efforts I have heard in years.  I only gave it 5 stars because they don't have 10 :)  I could ramble on but simply listen to the samples should be enough to convince anyone with a smallest amount of musical tastes.  Highly recommended does not even begun to cover it.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|My hat goes off to Charles Ferguson and the others who made this film.  This was a superbly made documentary - one of the best ever.  For those who do not believe in mass conspiracies, or that most of the world is ruled by mega corporations, banksters, and the politician whores that they purchase; your tidy little world is going to be rocked after watching this gem.      You will be disturbed to learn that the GLOBAL DEPRESSION & DISASTER, was an efficient joint effort among the who's who of the ruling syndicate; the banksters of course, the debt rating agencies, the Federal Reserve (abolish it!), the useless government agencies entrusted to police the banksters, the politicians (goes without saying), and even academia is now corrupted to the point of playing a significant role.  They all knew exactly what they were doing, and what the eventual outcome would be - yet hardly any of perpetrators have been prosecuted.  This was one hell of a conspiracy!  \\"Inside Job\\" should be required viewing.      If you would like to watch the best documentary ever, learn why the Federal Reserve must be abolished immediately, and witness an even greater more disturbing conspiracy, pick up a DVD copy of \\"The Money Masters - How International Bankers Gained Control of America\\" (available on Amazon).  If you watch \\"The Money Masters\\" first, \\"Inside Job\\" will make even more sense to you, and you will not nearly as surprised.
0756404738|4.0|I loved, loved, loved The Name of the Wind and couldn't wait for The Wise Man's Fear to come out but I have to say that I didn't enjoy book 2 as much as I did book 1. I still liked it enough that I'll get book 3 when it eventually comes out but Book 2 was a little over the top.  I know it's the life story of a hero but really?  Some of the things he does are just unbelievable. It's like reading fan fiction.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Back about ten years ago I was a huge Dream Theater fan.  Over years, I've gotten into heavier, faster and more complicated progressive metal, but this week I decided to listen to some DT again.  I remember liking Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, particularly the second disc.    Going through my Dream Theater collection, I must that - even after all these years - Six Degrees.. disc 2 is an incredible album, and in my opinion the best piece of music from Dream Theater, ever.    The first disc is pretty good, too, but the second disc is magic.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|Femme Fatale is nothing musically groundbreaking in the sense that recording artists might be expected create an album that fully utilizes a voice that spans several octaves, elaborate lyrics that try to convey an abstract thought and a plethora of musical instruments to create a life-changing, beautiful array of melodies. Not that recording artists who do utilize this formula to create their music are wrong, but Britney Spears, as we all know, could never create an album like the one previously described. And no, it isn't because she simply can't. It's because, at least in this stage of the game, that's not who she's is.       Plain and simple, Femme Fatale is just all around feel-good dance pop music. At this stage in Britney's career, we as music listeners should have already come to terms with the fact that she isn't one to release tracks containing beautifully moving lyrics (although \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Someday (I Will Understand)\\" are arguable exceptions) or produce a voice equivalent to those of fellow divas Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. No, Britney's moniker is to create music that motivates people to feel good, feel sexy, and just have fun.  Britney makes her stance as a pop icon known by influencing all people from all walks of life to listen to her songs not as a catalyst to go out and create world peace, but just have a great time. And what's wrong with that? Feel-good, fun pop is Britney's specialty, and she's never tried to be anything outside of it. She's stayed true to her musical self, in spite of the mass media saying she's \\"washed up\\" or \\"professional musicians\\" wishing she'd retire already (this review is written by a cultured classical music student, by the way).     Femme Fatale further enhances why we (or at least, her fans) love her. The album, in a nutshell, is sheer feel-good pop perfection.     5 stars, hands down.
B004KSQN7C|3.0|I have read so many reviews that either hail this album as some sort of revelation, or slam the album and disregard it as rubbish. I think either opinion is of someone not objectively looking at what is on offer, and has an unshakable opinion regardless of any product bearing the name Britney Spears. Is this album perfection? Um, certainly not. Is this album wretched drivel as some might suggest? I would certainly say that it is not that either. I was leery when people began praising the album's second single (\\"Till the World Ends\\") as some sort of dance opus, the likes of which had never been heard. The track has since grown on me, but my life hasn't been changed on any level. It's a good song,  but not as interesting as its predecessor, \\"Hold It Against Me\\".  As for the rest of the album, I feel pretty much the same way. It is listenable, and there are some very well produced and solid tracks; I would hesitate to even call any of it filler, but some songs (for this reviewer anyway), don't stack up to others. The biggest problem is that this album becomes repetitive in its themes without even attempting to try anything new. This album could have been called One Track Mind or Tonight since the latter is has an utterance on  nearly every track about something happening or going down \\"tonight\\". It works for a while, but it get tedious by the forgettable \\"Gasoline\\". And then there's the undercooked \\"Trip To Your Heart\\" courtesy of Bloodshy & Avant, that leaves a bit to be desired. Especially given their contributions to Spears' previous albums - including the delightfully cooky \\"How I Roll\\" on Femme Fatale. It seems every review must mention Blackout to compare it, or perhaps to give notice to a wonderful album whose release timing was its only real downfall.     If you like Britney Spears you will at least like, if not love this album. However, it is not her best. In case you are wondering, it is not Blackout to be sure; which easily her crowning achievement. It grabsa stronger hold on a first spin than Circus, but the appeal to warm on the listener over time seems to be absent here. I think the tracks you don't care for right away won't be any more appealing three months down the line. Most likely because the tracks you like are about the same thing but done in a style that appeals to you.  This album won't be for everyone, and its hype isn't totally misguided. People expect so little from Spears these days that an album like this comes off as a triumph. I would say a calling it a triumph or a catastrophe is going too far, either way. But since you've made it this far, listen to the album all the way through. If you don't want to do that, at least check out the magnificent \\"Inside Out,\\" the irresistible \\"I Wanna Go,\\" and the unexpectedly addictive \\"Trouble For Me\\". The bonus tracks on the deluxe version make the album a bit lengthy, but the Rodney Jerkins produced \\"He About To Lose Me\\" offers some range and style with a very welcome change of pace. \\"Criminal\\" is another track worth a listen, but not as exciting as some of the material that comes before and after it.
0446563048|4.0|Tony Sheih's first book. It's autobiographical and focuses on the Zappos story, it's failures and successes. There are some good lessons in here for big business and while it's not a blue print for how to run a business managers and CEO's as well as the rank and file can find some gems in here.<br /><br />Tony would like Delivering Happiness to turn into a movement and has been studying the science of happiness which is writes about in chapter 7. He's hoping to inspire everyone to find happiness and his happiness bus tour is proving that families and individuals are being inspired by his book. It's a great read!

B00005N6KG|4.0|I use these headphones for all my runs.  They are lightweight and stay on my head and in my ears after miles and miles of pounding.  They do not seal off all sound from the surrounding environment, which makes them safer for runners who need to stay aware of their surroundings.  On the downside, these headphones always seem to stop working after about 6 months of use.  That's not a big deal given how inexpensive they are, but it's a bit annoying.
0316044938|5.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is one of my favorite books. I became so absorbed in the book that when a character cried, I cried. When a character laughed, I laughed. It was disturbing because the tragedy that occurs in the book can happen to a person in reality. However, some of the story was too over the top. For example, when Suzie comes back from the dead and possesses the body of another person it seems to fake. After, Suzie is so easily able to convince her crush when she was alive, that it's really her in another person's body. Because if this, the story becomes less realistic. Yes, the story is supposed to be fiction and based on the supernatural, but, there is a difference between supernatural and fake/non-relatable. This book really teaches people a lesson, and about what is truly important in life. Suzie made the crucial mistake of following the stranger, Mr. Harvey into the clubhouse. She destroyed her and her family's future. As cheesy as it sounds, this book teaches people about \\"stranger danger\\". Reading this, I leaned how important family is and how fragile life is. The Lovely Bones pulled on my emotional strings. It is so hard to deal with death, loss and not knowing. This book perfectly demonstrates the emotions of a grieving family. For example, when everyone only recognized Lindsey ad \\"The dead girl's sister\\" I almost burst into tears. The Lovely Bones left me on the edge of my seat. I didn't want to stop reading it. The author uses dramatic irony throughout the book. I knew that Mr. Harvey murdered Suzie, but the other characters in the book did not. This creates suspense for the reader. The Lovely Bones is a story that will change your life.    I would recommend this book to anyone ages fifteen or older. The book has a story that everyone can understand and relate to in some way. The content is clear and very easy to read. It sometimes is confusing when the focus changes from Suzie to the people in the book that is alive. The vocabulary in the book is not difficult at all. There are a few words here and there that may need to be looked up in the dictionary, but mostly, context clues can be used to understand what the word means. Also, this novel is good for teens because it teaches a valuable lesson about safety.
B000002L7J|5.0|Un álbum muy excelente. Se lo recomiendo a quien le gusta una buena banda de pop, y es representante de la mejor música de los años 80.

By the end of the first chapter, I already had a grin on my face, having already realized what a wonder of a book I was reading. It is a total love story for anyone who was a special spot in their heart for literature. After some brutal lows and some thrilling highs, this was one of the most rewarding books I have read in a long while. Thank you Mr. Zafon.
0679735909|1.0|The description of this book makes it sound so enticing, so exciting: two scholars thrown together by their love of Victorian poets who, as it turns out, were probably in love with each other. Libraries, romance, mystery! What's not to like?    Unfortunately, the pace of this book dragged interminably. The characters were cold, unsympathetic (okay, maybe there was some pity/empathy for Roland) and developed incredibly slowly. The plot inched along. And there was poetry everywhere. Understandable, I suppose, with the subject of the book, but the poems were often long and a trifle convoluted, and ultimately rather useless because the characters would discuss and analyze them shortly after - it was like being forced to read the poem twice!    Toward the end of the book I was so desperate for something, anything to happen (there are very few exciting, key plot developments) that I ended up skipping about 50 pages so I could just find out how it ended. I'm normally a voracious reader and can finish a book like this in two or three days, but this took me weeks. It didn't help that I'd start falling asleep after only getting through a couple pages before bed! And even then, the ending was very...blah. I got no real satisfaction out of finishing it.    So, if you need a boring book, this one is for you.

0307593495|5.0|Wallander is a Swedish police detective who carries the world on his shoulders.  He suffers from diabetes, drinks too much and is very lonely.  He often dwells on the dark side of life.  After his fiftieth birthday party, thrown by his colleagues, he starts to write a list of everyone he knew who has died.  The list depresses him so much that he has to stop because there are so many suicides on the list.<br /><br />Recently, Wallender went on a drinking binge and for some reason took his police revolver with him, leaving it at a restaurant.  He was reported and put on administrative leave.  During the time he is on leave, his daughter Linda has a baby.  This is the one bright spot in his life.  He agrees to go to Linda's prospective father-in-law's 75th birthday party.  While there, Linda's prospective father-in-law,  Hakan Von Enke, tells him a very troubling story.  Early in the 1980's, while he was in the navy, he was an officer on a Swedish submarine.  The Swedish submarine detected a Russian submarine in Swedish waters where it should not be.  Remember, this was still the height of the cold war.  The protocol was to scare the ship and if the ship did not retreat, the protocol was then to drop depth charges to force it to the surface.  For some unknown reason, the commander was told to leave the ship alone. The ship was let go and Von Enke has become obsessed with what or who was behind this order.  On top of that, he is acting fearful, as though there is someone after him.  At one point in his conversation with Wallender, he hears a noise and his hand goes inside his jacket. Wallender suspects that Von Enke is carrying a gun.  There is also someone suspicious lurking outside the window.<br /><br />A short time after Wallender and Von Enke have this talk, Von Enke disappears.  He leaves for his morning walk and never returns.  On top of that, Louise, his wife, also disappears some time later.  Wallender decides that he needs to look for them and find out what happened.  After all, they are Linda's prospective in-laws.  He is still on administrative leave when he begins to look for them, fairly sure that their disappearance is connected in some way to the story about the submarine.  Wallender gets to learn a lot more about the cold war than he ever knew before.  Once Wallender is back at his job, though he is not officially part of the investigation to find the von Enkes, he continues to look for them.  Suffice it to say, nothing is what it seems and the plot unfolds with many unexpected twists and turns leaving the reader spellbound.  Most importantly, this book reflects real life and the consequences, both intended and unintended, of past actions.<br /><br />Though this is a mystery, it is much less action driven than a typical American mystery.  We get to know a lot about Wallender: his fears about aging, his loneliness, his philosophy of life and his generalized depressive attitude.  The book has many twists and turns but is ultimately character driven.  It is a fine book about a detective that has won the hearts of many readers.  I know that I will miss him a lot.  However, Mankell is very versatile and besides mysteries he has recently written a fine book called Daniel.

B0009WFFS6|5.0|I was never a big cream fan,,to be frank,always wondered what the fuss was all about with this band. I grew up in the 80s,my favorite was and has been Van Halen. I have read numerous comments that Edward Van Halen has made with regards to Cream being his biggest influence,however, never gave it much thought...... I mean Clapton is great and all,,but they were just ok to me. After watching this show,I quickly realized that this trio is one of the most talented,dynamic rock bands of all time.

The story starts with her struggle to handle her new-found fame as the winner of the Hunger Games with the unusual result of winning with Peeta, which we know from the last book her attempted suicide prevented by The Capitol, the police state that runs the Hunger Games and 12 Districts.<br /><br />Katniss as a character was very uneven and at times unrealistic.  Her inability to handle the President Snow's threat to kill her beloved Gale (whom she keeps denying she has any feelings for) by running away and vomiting - I mean, really?<br /><br />The other characters in the book seem to have to deal with her inabilities and faults and do it quite well.  There are times in the story where their criticisms of Katniss align with my own: Why criticize her mother when she is a much better healer than Katniss?  Why run at the jabberjays sent by the Capitol to demoralize her by imitating her sister Prim?  And when she knows it's a trick, keeps falling for it anyway.  Gosh!<br /><br />Without revealing too much, her selfishness collides strongly with her sudden desire to protect Peeta to the death.  And when the Hunger Games are redone as the Quarter Quell (where the Capitol, at an anniversary of the Games and to show the Districts whose boss, bring in all the past victors into one big battle), again why would the Capitol do that?<br /><br />They are already dealing with the unexpected protests set off by a reluctant revolutionary in Katniss (who really has no clue what she's really done until the end) so why further inflame the populace by killing more of the District's heroes from past Games?<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Inconsistent characterization with Katniss made it very hard to sympathize with her.  The actions of The Capitol, even as a police state that it was, were hardly logical and only further inflame the populace!<br /><br />The second book of this trilogy to me is a hiccup, a pause, a chapter if you will.  The third book (per reviews) is supposed to be much better.  Hopefully Suzanne Collins will not disappoint in Book Three.  Catching Fire certainly has!<br /><br />Suggest!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0545265355 Hunger Games Trilogy Boxset]]<br />[[ASIN:B004P1JE6Q The Girl Who Was on Fire: Your Favorite Authors on Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games Trilogy]]h Katniss made it very hard to sympathize with her.

B004I2K4DY|4.0|Alfie Boe is simply the best Jean Valjean ever. The rest of the cast is superb, with the exception of Nick Jonas. WHY he was ever cast in this role, I will never know. He is so obviously out of his league here. There were, I'm sure, a thousand others who could have done the role justice. Anyway, if you can look past that, this is definitely one for your video library!
1558216847|5.0|what an unbelievable fight for liberty and freedom.  these men were and are so brave and strong and the crimes against them were a crime to souls and incredibly evil.  the celebration is their freedom and their unreal strength to get to that.  A very good read and recommend to anyone who believes freedom is a gift!
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Britney works to appeal to ALL fans, not just gay ones. and this album is amazing by the way. Best tracks: Trip to your heart, Inside Out, Selfish, He About To Lose Me, I Wanna Go, How I Roll, Criminal. Gaga fans made a group on facebook to rate Brit's album one star. How sad. Then come may, they'll bitch about Britney fans rating one star on Born This Way. Grow up little monsters, we'll see where your mother monster is in 13 years. She looks 42 right now, imagine how she'll evolve within a decade. If she was all about her music, she wouldn't dress like a fool. Gaga was 'born this way', but she changed her name, her fashion, her hair, and her music style to become famous. Real powerful role model you are Lady. Anyways, Britney is the QUEEN OF POP. Maybe Gaga will be in a few years, but you can't take the throne with just 3 albums and 2 years in the business. That's no indication of success. Britney was way more popular than Gaga was in her first 3 years, but she never was trying to coin herself as 'the most talented female in the music industry'. Love Britney! Like Gaga! Hate her rude little monsters.

1597801585|5.0|In this story, the world 'as we know it' is no more. Oil resources are gone, and in leaving, took with them many technologies. Factory power is now generated by huge genetically modified elephants who power gear trains. Climate change has put Bangkok under sea level, but high levees, huge pumps, and much prayer has held back the sea - so far.     'Calorie companies' sell genetically modified foodstuffs that are immune to the diseases that the calorie companies themselves create and release to create markets for their seed. In addition, pollen from the genetically modified crops renders other non-GMO crops sterile. Thailand is working hard to resist the pressure to become just another captive client of the calorie companies.    One thing that hasn't changed is human nature. A group of characters cross paths as they follow their separate destinies:     - A calorie man - working undercover - works to bring Thailand into his company's embrace while seeking out new crops that his company can exploit.   - A desperate refuge - once a prosperous businessman with a large and happy family - struggles to survive in a country where he's not wanted. He fears the repeat of the kind of event that exterminated his family and left him a penniless refugee in another country.   - A charismatic and idealistic leader of the Thai Environmental ministry goes a little too far one night enforcing environmental laws, annoying the powerful head of the Trade ministry, and setting off a chain of events that changes the lives of everyone else in the novel.   - A genetically-modified human (the 'Windup Girl of the title) was once the talented and elegant companion of a Japanese businessman. However, it was cheaper to acquire a new companion in Japan than to re-import his windup back into Japan. Instead of being properly disposed of, the abandoned windup survives day-to-day in a country where she is liable to be casually put to death - 'mulched' - at any time if she's identified for what she is. Her extreme vulnerability results in her being ruthlessly exploited in the only place that will take her in.    It's a fascinating story that takes place in a world far removed from the world of today. Or so we hope.    The characters of the story are very interesting - if imperfect - and the world of the story is vividly imagined. This story of an unattractive future may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those willing to enter the author's world will find themselves in a rich world unlike others they've encountered before.
0061537969|5.0|I wasn't sure what I would think of this book. I can't remember where I had heard of it. We recently spent a great deal of time on a plane headed west, so I figured I'd make some headway on the book. I cried like crazy, connecting with the story, and sweet Enzo, the lead character. I have a dog myself, and I know she's smart, but after reading this book I'm going to be more aware of what she sees, ans try to figure out what she KNOWS from watching and listening to everything. I finished the story within 2 days - I DEVOURED it, like a drooling animal, crying the whole time. We stayed with friends who own 5 dogs, and I couldn't help hugging them all, and trying to read what they're thinking. I couldn't wait to get home to squeeze my sweet Bella and tell her how much I love her. PLEASE get this book. The humanity, the bond between man and dog, the family connection... I need to order several copies now, because 1) I gave mine away, and now I don't have one, and 2) I've suggested it to so many people! Thank you Garth Stein!! You're a genius!
B000GCG59W|1.0|I'm always surprised on how nobody dares to discover when the king goes naked.  Every record I hear sung by this woman bore me more than her former one.  I really would LOVE to find something on this. But i don't.  Someone said \\"flamenco redefined\\".  Really far away from this definition, stand this sound.  There are far more consistent names ( both male and female ) deserving that goal and buika is not one of them.  If you are lucky enough to fall in a mighty producer hands then almost half or more of te way is done.  I'm afraid that is the case here.  Listen to Ojos Verdes sung by the first woman to translate it into jazz, Martirio, and try holding Buika version far than  five seconds if you can...
B003PIUC02|5.0|I first watched the season 2 of Spartacus: Gods of the Areana on Starz with no knowledge of there being a season 1 of Spartacus. I was blown away from all the action, story and there is much adult content, but whats there not to love about that! The story behind Blood and Sand is very interesting, giving an insite on a legend that some of us have heard of from school or from the Spartacus movie with Kirk Douglas. In Blu ray format it was one of the best shows I have ever seen and would recommend it to anyone who likes action with a cross between the movie 300 and the movie Gladiator. It is sad to see the lead actor playing Spartacus drop out of the show due to cancer, but strongly again would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys action fighting scenes with a good story and softcore adult content.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|I heard about these guys through someone at my church. He let me borrow his album, I popped it into my cd player in my car on the way home and there it stayed. Usually I let a new cd play through so I can hear everything, but more than once with this album I skipped back and listened to one song 4 or 5 times in a row before moving on. The songwriting is amazing, with the exception of the Avett Brothers, I haven't heard such insightful/uplifting lyrics from such a young band in today's popular music. It's a good mix of slow/soft and driving music. This is also the first album in a long time I've actively tried to advocate for, these guys are good and I can't wait to hear if they can follow this amazing debut up with another solid album.

B0043ZDU1E|5.0|I have to admit I find myself enjoying The Wind That Shakes the Barley more so than I did with Loreena's previous studio album An Ancient Muse. I pretty much took to the music more quickly than I did with An Ancient Muse (which is a very good album, just not flawless). I personally liked the more uptempo tracks on the album. I think it is good that Loreean tries to not stick to one particular tempo with her music. My personal favorite song? The beautiful instrumental \\"Biran Boru's March\\". I enjoyed every single track on the album. I find her music so relaxing and soothing to listen to at any time of day.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|If it is true that this will, *deep, tired sigh* once again be George Lucas's stubborn refusal to give the people what they really want, then, no, George, you won't be getting my money for this either. I find it petty and immature that when he finally released the original versions of the films on DVD, he didn't even give the the full DVD res treatment! Nevertheless, they will be the discs I'll hold onto until Georgie decides to share. Again. For more money. Again.
B001KEGRC0|1.0|This is not a beautiful look of the Grand Canyon as it is marketed.  It is a overly politicized and pushy film from none other than the leftist Robert Kennedy Jr.  It is full of unwarranted blame of Americans and massive propagandized misinformation wrapped in a sugary coat.
B004OEIL54|3.0|I bought the 3 SCREAM movies on blu-ray expecting to see a beautiful transfer but it was a disappointment.None of the 3 movies looked very good. A lot of grain and it looked kinda cheap. I regret buying it!

B00008G8LG|2.0|I bought this DVD some years ago, because I like Jodi Foster and I loved The King and I.  It was a mistake.  Jodi showed no spirit in this film and she acted as though she wished it were over as soon as it started. Either she was directed badly or she was just not right for the film.    Not much else to say.  After seeing The King and I with it's beautiful music and great acting, all I can say is that I fell asleep watching this one.

B004A8ZWSS|2.0|Not sure what the idea behind this movie was, perhaps no idea just put Depp and Jolie together. While Angelina was elegant, the movie was boring. There was no mystery, I knew the answers less than 1/2 way through the movie. What really added to making this movie boring was the excessive amount of filler. Scene after scene drags on and on with nothing happening.    To like this movie you have to be a serious Depp or Jolie fan who can overlook no plot and no action.     To equate this movie to past classic movie does those movies a disservice. The Tourist will never be a classic as it doesn't have a plot and Depp will never be a good actor.     If you are looking for a fast paced action thriller mystery, look elsewhere. If you like mysteries, look elsewhere as a child could figure this one out in no time. I wasted $4 on this movie, hope you don't.    But on the plus side are great shots of Jolie looking fantastic, great shots of Venice and that's about it.
B002VECM6S|4.0|Well worth watching and if you ever doubted Sandra Bullock can act just get a load of this. Great entertainment
B004NSULHM|1.0|First off.......the CD is the cheapest packaging I have EVER seen for a major band release. Poorly made, no inserts...makes digipacks look like high class. The music is atmospheric at best (translation...this is music for when you don't want to listen to music, which can be ok at times). I hope this isn't the end of the road for these guys as I love their other efforts. This feels like a break up album, something just thrown together to fulfill a contract after a band breaks up (yes I know they didn't breakup). To give this album 4 to 5 stars would be to cheapen their better albums. I would gamble that not one person who has given this album 5 stars would say this is equal or better then The Bends, OK Computer or In Rainbows.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|Within Temptation have released another dramatic, fun, and creative album.  The Unforgiving probably has WT's best guitar work to date, and as always Sharon's vocals are amazing -- powerful, beautiful, and emotional -- even as she experiments with several new sounds.  Her trademark high pure voice is still here, but is used less often than before (really, just as a contrasting accent).  Many songs feature lower, more aggressive vocals.  My only regret is her pure voice doesn't appear a bit more, but I do appreciate the variety.    And there's a lot of variety.  Some songs are probably WT's heaviest since Enter, with excellent riffs.  Several are quite catchy.  There is still a lot of orchestra.  Sinead is probably symphonic metal trance.  No one's made that before, and it's great.    WT took a chance by trying some new things, and it paid off.  They said they needed to mix things up to stay interested, and you have to respect that.  The alternative is bands who keep phoning in the same stuff when the spark has gone.      WT have also taken doing a concept album to a new level.  Very cool to make a soundtrack that doesn't strain to tell the whole story, supported by short movies and comics for context.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|When I heard Aaorn Sorkin was writing a film about Facebook I knew that whatever you may think about Zuckerberg, or Facebook itself, it would at least be well written and have superb dialogue.  I was proven right.<br /><br />This film chart Facebooks inception, its growth and the legal wrangling over it's ownership.  Zuckerberg comes across as a narcissistic, arrogant, socially inept misfit, but also someone who happens to be extremely clever and able to take a basic idea and run with it.  You see how he alienates all those around him, as well as betray those who believed in him and gave him ideas and support.  It is quite sad to see and leaves a mild distaste in your mouth when you next go to logon to your Facebook account.  You also feel slight pity for him and you have at least some understanding of what drives him and why he behaves the way he does.<br /><br />This is acted well by all involved and Timberlake is a particular surprise as the cocky, self assured Sean Parker.  It is also directed very well and the muted colours and dark lighting add a certain atmosphere to the proceedings.  I was pleasantly surprised how interesting this was for the duration and what could be a rather staid and uninspired story is portrayed in an interesting and entertaining way.  I credit Sorkin with a great deal of this success.<br /><br />If you have a Facebook account (and to be honest, who doesn't these days), you may find this interesting and if you enjoy good drama, with snappy dialogue and credible acting then this is another reason to give this a watch.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004LSJCJM|4.0|After last year's debatable venture onto the Supergroup highway with Black Country Communion, Bonamassa is back with a strong, albeit, somewhat predictable solo set. No complaints though. What is really impressive is his growth as a lead vocalist. The songs are strong, the playing is superb as always, but vocally, you actually are looking forward to the vocals kicking in. They don't just complement his songs as in the past, they elevate them. A wonderful talent gets better with age. Now, if only Black Country Communion's follow-up, which is being recorded now, could kick up a little dust that the first one didn't. I have my doubts, but at least \\"Dust Bowl\\" does the job for now.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Absolutely loved this book.  A mature telling of Harry Potter meets Twilight.  History, magic, and science all weaves into a fantastic story.

1400052181|4.0|This book offers alot, but if you are looking for technically scienfitic literature, you will be disappointed.  I knew alittle bit about this book before I picked it up, and I was more than satisfied, particularly with the author's ability to make history, science, sociology, and human stories all relatable, and relevant to the reader. The people in this book, Lacks' family, scientist, technicians, lawyers, ethicists, and even con-artists, tell such vivid stories of the relatively recent history that reflect the complex society we live in--not only the progress in medicine and research, but the history of injustice and sufferings of the underprivileged class, and continuing socioeconomic stratifications of our society in the 21st Century and the ambiguous nature of ethics in science.  I thought that the author's relationships with the Lacks family were something very special and respectful.

B000002KHH|4.0|OK, it's one of the greatest metal albums of all time, and help found the genre. But the album cover and songs like Hand of Doom, Fairies Wear Boots, and Planet Caravan suggest a Psychedelic band. Of course, they prefered heroin and alcohol to mind expanding substances. War Pigs is the classic anti-war song and I never tire of it. I never tire of the three other songs I mentioned, and Electric Funeral is classic. But like Iron Man, Ozzy just sings the guitar line on electric Funeral.     One of the wierdest things is that two months before this album came out, a very similar song to War Pigs and probably heavier was released called \\"Sin's A Good Man's Brother\\" by Grand Funk Railroad. Also, an anti-war song it seems. I use to confuse the two. Heck I was Five at the time, but with an older brother. War Pigs is the 4th best anti-war song after the above mentioned, Child in Time by Deep Purple and Gimme Shelter by the Stones, and ELP's Lucky Man. Ok thats 5, but its 4th in that list.    It should be noted that Ozzy didn't write any Sabbath lyrics, Geezer did. In fact he didn't write any of his solo tunes until No More Tears, and even that is in question.     In case you don't know, Ozzy Osbourne is everybody's favorite incoherent Dad from the MTV reality show \\"The Osbournes\\", yea.    But this album is still excellent. I'm pretty tired of Iron Man and Paranoid though. Bill Ward best remembers recording this album and Born Again, the two albums that best represent this style of Black Sabbath and the genius of his playing.    I have to deduct a half star for the lack of album art. What's with the cheese? If struggling bands like Yes and Judas Priest could put out efforts like this great album, and have great artwork, Black Sabbath could have too. Another half star for 4 decades of playing Iron Man and Paranoid. Give it a rest already. Not your best tunes.    If you want to get into Black Sabbath, this is the place to start. I've had this album in one form or another sinceits release. Master of Reality and Sabatoge are the best albums of Ozzy era, in my view. Still this is solid, and stronger than their first effort. 4 out of 5 stars. I also suggest Born Again as the full circle album complete with powerful Bill Ward drums, heavy Sabbath motifs and a cheese album cover with Sharon \\"Digital B's\\" Arden's baby photo displayed.

B0037RDPEG|5.0|I was a bit concerned when I read the reviews before purchasing this book. Comments like \\"it's all about you\\" etc seemed very harsh - and then I realised that this book SHOULD be all about Liz Gilbert - it was her story!      I had already seen the movie and as I enjoyed that first glimpse I ignored the reviews and bought it - and I am soooo glad I did!    This is one of the best books I have ever read. Being a writer myself I love reading an autobiographical account written by someone who can actually write. Liz reaches out from the page and drags you into her world, her experiences and at times I thought she was actually writing about my life.  Now that's a good writer.    So well done Liz. If that's what you wanted to achieve it worked for me!

B003O85W3A|4.0|I fell in love with Arcade Fire only recently when I stumbled upon their second Saturday Night Live performance.  (I'm out of the loop being an ex-pat). R&eacute;gine Chassagne blew me away with her performance of the Sprawl II.  It was so gutsy and powerful that I listened to it dozens of times, getting chills each time. I too hate/d the sprawl and found a way out by selling my house and car and moving to Europe. I immediately bought the album and listened to that song 20 more times. It has become an anthem for us.<br />When I got around to it, I eventually listened to the rest of the songs and was VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED! R&eacute;gine Chassagne is NOT the lead singer??!! Are you crazy??  Win Butler is good; retroish, 80ish, perfectly alternativish, but R&eacute;gine Chassagne is amazing! She sings lead on another song but that is it.<br />I listened to the other songs again and again trying to see what other people saw and I eventually got it.  The album, and their other albums are very good.  4 star good. Several songs stand out as winners.<br />But I cant give 5 stars with them wasting R&eacute;gine Chassagne in a backup role.

B0031RAOW8|5.0|I first rented the movie Hachi and, after viewing it, could not imagine not having this sweet and tender movie in my personal video library.    I loved the true story of Hachi's deep love for his human.  Their relationship was mutual as you could see the pleasure each derived from being in the company of the other.  Hachi's deep desire to please was so evident when he surprised Richard Gere by doing something not common to his temperament, i.e., fetching.    This is a movie that, once seen, I cannot imagine it ever being forgotton.  Very highly recommended.  And, there is nothing in the film that is inappropriate for children.

0143118706|2.0|While I am only mid-way through this book, I have begun to feel as though Gilbert is happily researching all the reasons why her marriage will prosper, and mine will not. I am in my early twenties, married to a man in his late twenties, and I feel as though Gilbert is not so much researching marriage, as she is all the reasons why Felipe is perfect for her. Although it is a memoire, and power to her for writing it, I sense a certain judgement on those of us out there who aren't as spiritually enlightened with all of her precious life lessons that will inevitably lead to her happy ending.   She mentioned that people who marry young (as I did) are \\"more irresponsible, less self-aware, more careless, and less economically stable than when we are older\\", while the latter may be true, she may well have been those things at a young age, but it's not to say that everyone is, and it's not to say that we're all doomed unless we're approaching our forties and a second marriage, which apparently automatically makes you wise and worldly no matter what.   I did love EPL, and still respect Gilbert as a talented writer. Her words are beautifully strung together which makes it an easy read. I suppose everyone who has a love story wants to tell the world about why they are luckiest and the happiest on the planet, which is what I feel this memoir has done.

1439153663|4.0|Though predictable and melodramatic, The Kitchen House hooked me with its two alternating narrators, who tell the story in a straightforward, sequential fashion, with a little overlap between the two.  This was a refreshing change from so many books these days that have dual storylines in two different time periods or, worse yet, such checkered timeframes that it's difficult to keep up with what happened when or even in which generation.  The book begins in the voice of Lavinia, a white, 7-year-old indentured servant whose parents died on the voyage from Ireland in the late 1700's.  She quickly becomes the darling of the kitchen slaves at Tall Oaks, a Virginia tobacco plantation.  Her big break comes when she goes to Williamsburg to live with the relatives of the owner's wife.  Although heartbroken about leaving behind the black servants who have become her surrogate family, she receives a proper education in both academics and social etiquette to prepare her for an advantageous marriage.  The other narrator is Belle, the owner's mulatto daughter who all the white folks believe to be his mistress.  In fact, the plot largely hinges on Lavinia's various misconceptions about who did what to whom to the point that she deprives herself of the happily-ever-after life she could have with Will Stephens, the overseer at Tall Oaks.  I found myself slapping my forehead in frustration with each of her bonehead moves, but her poor decision-making is partly due to several factors outside her control.  One is that her station in life is a little precarious, and she feels that any inquiries she makes will jeopardize her situation.  The other is that there are just basically a lot of secrets among the slaves, who have even more at stake than Lavinia does and, even so, are frequently punished for the misdeeds of the white folk.  The book, then, comes off as somewhat of a soap opera, where the heroes and villains are clearly distinguishable, but the good guys may inadvertently contribute to their own demise by jumping to the wrong conclusion.  Soap operas can be addictive, though, and this one had me eagerly looking forward to each episode.

B004SDSSFY|4.0|I think most of the people reviewing this are complete idiots. I have had this application since it came out it has always worked great. It also connects you with google docs.

I love this application the price is worth it if you are a person who uses there phone for actual bussiness and not just facebook.

B004J4WQ46|1.0|The most important thing you should know about this album: RUN! RUN THE OTHER WAY!<br />Listening to it is an exercise in patience. \\"After all, it's The Strokes! I like The Strokes!\\"<br />The sad truth is the \\"music\\" here is amateurish, poseur crap. (I'd give it no stars if I could.)<br />When you go to a bar and see a band that's playing imitations of other, trendy bands' style, and after a few beers think to yourself \\"Well, OK, that was pretty good\\" -- then never give the band a second thought? That's what you got here. Except they have a reputation that might color your listening into thinking that \\"of course\\" it must be good.<br />I put this album in the same discard box with Emerson, Lake & Palmer's \\"Love Beach\\" -- and, to be merciful, I hope someone in the band is as physically unhealthy as members of ELP were when they made \\"Love Beach\\" because at least then they'd have an understandable excuse for foisting this crap on their public.
0385732554|4.0|The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is a fascinating story of a young man named Jonas who lives in an isolated community that has chosen to live meticulous societal laws that hinder freedom of choice and give the image of being a perfect place. Every member of the community is assigned a role and when Jonas reaches the age of twelve, he is personally taught by The Giver, who holds the secrets and memories of life before the community changed, or in essence, the truth.     The book really took me into a mindset that I didn't expect. I imagined the difficulties I would have by experiencing things that none of my friends or family members could relate to. Imagining myself trying to explain what love feels like to someone who has never experienced it in any way, shape, or form was almost painful. I could almost feel the loneliness of having a vision that is beyond that of any of my associates or loved ones, yet not being able to express to them the real significance of our surroundings.     Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the psychological roller-coaster ride that the book took me on. I had to ask myself many times how I would respond to the situations that Jonas was in if it were me. Lowry wrote in simple context yet portrayed her message very well through examples and the memories Jonas receives.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Book should be listed as fiction. Not very believable. Wild, crazy stories of people that might not have existed, that far too many people take far too seriously. Some good lessons, generally positive overall intention.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I thought DTG looked like it would be better than Quickoffice with more features, and I installed the free version which seemed to display word docs better on my Droid X than QO.  But I purchased this from the Amazone Appstore, received a text, clicked the link to open the appstore app, and could not download it.  I opened the link in my browser and it seemed to install, but when I opened it and tried to create a document, it kept telling me I had to purchase the full version.  Hello!  I supposedly did that!  Had a hell of a time trying to find a way to contact Amazon and finally found a number in my appstore app on my phone.  SUPPOSEDLY they are going to refund my money it 2 -3 days.  I know Amazon is all about the Customer Experience, but they have failed miserably.  I am afraid to purchase any digital download from them or recommend such to anyone now.  Massive fail.  Do not buy.I tried to rate zero starts but it would not accept my review without giving it 1 star.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|can not sign in the cloud service on my android tablet using this app. Although wifi is on, it can't find the network connection. It is the same connection session I downloaded the app and write this comments. I can log in through PC.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|When it tags songs it gives you a few more options (than SoundHound Infinity) once identified.  You can look up band bio &amp; band tour info, along with checking out a video on YouTube.  Otherwise its about the same as SoundHound.  However if you don't mind googling lyrics, discography,etc on your own just stick with the free version that ID's song name &amp; artist.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|I have seen the original version of this movie, the newer version is good, it will make you mad, but part of the suspense is that she will get even in ways that some guys might not want to view.  A woman scorned with revenge is nothing but a women's empowering movie.  It was a good remake, but lack common sense when it comes to a women who travels alone and moves into a cabin in the back woods says it all.  But a great movie to watch with the girls and discuss just what will you really do if you wanted revenge?
B003NFM3JU|4.0|esta adaptacion esta muy bien hecha la verdad es que aunque uno ya sabe como termina todo la pelicula les quedo muy bien
B004GJDQT8|5.0|True story.  I wanted to purchase The Matrix on Blue-ray and went into Best Buy to see if they had a copy.  They had it but it was waaay overpriced so I looked it up on the Amazon Mobile app and found it there for about fifteen dollars less.  I found a manager and showed him the price difference and he reduced the price of the Blue-ray so I ended up going home with it that day.    That is probably not the story that Amazon wants people to hear, and I think it depends on the store manager you pick up, too, but that is the biggest use I've found for this app.    I have used it for other things, too.  I love Amazon reviews, especially after how many I have written.  So when I see a product I've picked up this mobile app, brought up the item, and read the reviews right there in the store.  I love it!!  This Amazon will be happy to hear: I have seen it at such a good price I've purchased things while in the store and waited a couple of days for it to show up in the mail.    You can do all of this from your Android browser of choice, but this mobile app is built with mobile technology in mind.  It is soooo much better than surfing with such small real-estate.  It is easy to navigate around and I have found it to be very informative while out shopping.    I have no complaints as I've gotten a lot of use out of this free app.  Highly recommended, it should be on every Android.

B004SBX112|5.0|I loved Angry birds and I have it both on Android and my iPad.  The Android version is beat all the way through just because it is always with me when I'm looking for something to pass the time.  My iPad gets left behind at times.    My only complaint of the Android version was that you could only get the free version only, which meant that it was ad supported.  And those ads got in the way quite often as it appeared in the upper-right corner where the score is displayed.  Annoying!  I often followed the ads only because I accidentally clicked on them.  I wished that they had a paid version.    Angry birds seasons will have to do.  They have redone the game with themes matching various holidays such as Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, and Halloween.  It is just as entertaining and challenging as the original but adds a new variety in themes that makes this fun all over again.    I'm glad I've picked this up even though it doesn't have as many levels as the first version.  Gut well worth the couple of bucks to get rid of those annoying ads!

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the Kindle app.  I've had it on two Android phones (Moment and Evo), an iTouch, and two iPads (1 & 2).  It works perfectly on all of them!!  I've never had it crash.    I know this is a review for the Android version, but I only mention my other devices because of the fact that I love how it sync's information between devices.  I did not know this as I had read most of a book on an iTouch and then stopped reading it for a few months.  When I installed it on my Evo I re-downloaded the book thinking I might go ahead and finish it but was concerned that I might not remember where I left off.  but when I opened the book, it took me right to the spot I had left off.    I must say, this impresses the living daylights out of me!!  Thank you, Amazon, for adding that as a feature.    Otherwise, it does everything you need in a book reader.  You can bookmark, you can change the size of the text, you can even change the coloring (I prefer Sepia when reading during the day and Black when reading at night).  In the Android version you can even \\"share\\" your progress so you can brag about what you've read to all your friends or those who might be reading with you.  You can even shop for books right inside the app.    I love this and it is no wonder that Kindle is such a strong contender in the eReader fields and it is always the first ebook reader I install any time I get a compatible device.  I look forward to what they release in the future as I'm sure it will only get better.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I judge a book like this based on its ideas and the craft of the writer.    For the ideas, it's good.  This book travels familiar ground (hey, look, it's a teenage orphan boy away at wizard school!).  But where it shines is in the writing.  Rothfuss is a great writer.  He moves easily betwen characters and locations and types of storytelling.  In the nuts-and-bolts of writing, this book is superb.  This is highly recommended.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|This is a really simple-to-use mp3 player, and I wish more players would take note.  It is easy to make a playlist, find a song, play a song, buy a song, or whatever else you usually need to do with .mp3's.  I love it!<br /><br />I also love how it ties into the cloud services and allows me to download my .mp3 purchases with a few taps on the screen.<br /><br />Somebody had complained that you couldn't make a playlist with song both on your local device and from the cloud.  While this is true, you can easily download the songs onto your device and then add them to your playlist.  Easy peasy!<br /><br />The only thing I wish I could do is to bookmark songs within a playlist.  I would love it if they would add it as it would be really easy.  I like to listen to both .mp3 music files and audiobook files and having a bookmark feature would allow me to switch between music and the spoken word without loosing my place inside of a book.  Amazon: PLEASE ADD!!  I have purchased (yes, I paid money) another book reader, Ambling BookPlayer, for this feature alone. I would love to have it all in one central location.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is great especially with it being tied into the Amazon Cloud storage services.  Just awesome!

B004E2XAFW|5.0|A little different than previous CD's but not in a bad way. I'm biased because they are my favorite band, and I want to marry Sharon, but this CD is powerful...every track. I can't wait for them to do some of these tracks live with an orchestra! One after the other, I couldn't catch my breath. Murder, Where is the Edge, Fire and Ice, Iron and Lost are my faces. Murder just blows the doors off.
0393338827|4.0|Really, a cracking read. A real page-turner.    The book details the evolution of the bet against sub-prime bonds. The detail and depth of each character is fascinating. It reads like a thriller - which, I suppose it is. The writing is superb and easy to follow.    Could have done a better job showing the ambiguity in some of these trades. Instead it makes out one side to be really clever and another side to be really dumb - which is very easy to do in hindsight. Thats my only knock on it.
B002VECM4A|5.0|if i am ever shopping for videos , i will look for this seller first , it was just like new !!!!thanks
B0017SWPXY|5.0|My mom kept trying to get me to read this book for about 6 months, so I finally gave in, and I am very glad that I did.  I was pleasantly surprised by the book in so many ways.  The characters are interesting, realistic, and well-developed.  The story is told from the dog's point of view, which is unique and well done.  I am now constantly wondering what my dog thinks of me, my family, and our lives.  The story itself moved at a good pace and was well-written.  It was an unexpected combination of love, death, family, sports, and the law.  I did not want this book to end.  I would seriously recommend it to everyone.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I had this app on my Blackberry and quickly loaded it onto my EVO after upgrading.  I buy all my music on Amazon and this application has a great interface to purchase music on the go. The recent addition if the music player is fantastic, but needs a larger widget option and lock screen options.  As soon as these get incorporated into the app, it will be a 5 star.

0440246016|4.0|Lee Child has become my new favorite writer.  The only negative thing I can say about his books is that he is a master of creating chilling violent scenes!  The story, however, captures you so strongly that I endured the violent scenes and just kept turning the pages.  Once I started this book, I read and read until the last heart pounding page.

1554685133|2.0|I loved the movie and like most i have come to expect more from the novels than the movies created from them. However, not in this case. This type of book (the genre if you will) is exactly my type of book. I don't claim to know a great deal of Indian poverty however i can tell you that this book so poorly represents the truth of slum living in India and the plight of orphans that i feel embarrassed for the writer. The movie was far more realistic and the storyline was significantly altered to this effect. Take out the Indian names, the references to Indian food and the names of Indian locations and this could be a book about an orphan growing up in England or USA only with an excessive number of references to pedophilia. The author is deeply out of touch with the true India. As a diplomat he has obviously spent far more of his life outside of India and I am extremely confident he has never truly experienced an Indian slum except maybe peering in from the outskirts. I would imagine some poorer class Indians would find this novel offensive. HOWEVER, i gave the book a good chance. It is light and humorous at times, but after a four or five chapters the poor writing is a real struggle. It is very basic writing, it has no flow or structure and the strength of the story is weak despite the remarkable life he is trying to describe. This man is not a talented author.
B002SQ364Q|3.0|Oscar-winning director Ang Lee's \\"Taking Woodstock\\" takes us behind the scenes of the Woodstock Music & Art Fair, but don't expect documentary-like accounts of the legendary concert. Based on the book by Elliot Tiber and Tom Monte, and adapted by James Schamus (\\"Brokeback Mountain\\"), \\"Taking Woodstock\\" is a comedy drama about a young man who wound up bringing Woodstock to the quiet town of Bethel, New York.    The film, set in the summer of 1969, centers on 34-year-old Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin), an interior designer whose parents Jake (Henry Goodman) and Sonia (Imelda Staunton) run El Monaco Motel. The small motel, of which service and quality is not the best in town, is facing foreclosure.     Elliot manages to persuade the bank manager to wait for a while. Then he hears that the town of Wallkill pulled the permit for the upcoming Woodstock festival. Elliot, who happens to have a permit for a small local music festival, makes an offer to the concert's organizers. As it turned out, the music festival ends up attracting about 500,000 people to the town.     I am not interested in the factual accuracy of \\"Taking Woodstock.\\" I know this is not a documentary (and there is already one, simply amazing \\"Woodstock\\"). The film beautifully captures the confusion (and near chaos) caused by the influx of attendees for the three-day concert. Ang Lee's comedy drama is full of fashion details and eccentric characters, mostly likable, but suffers from its underwritten drama about the protagonist and his family, and one-note performance from the lead. Where is Jake Gyllenhaal when we need him?     I enjoyed \\"Taking Woodstock\\" for its atmosphere of the late 60s America, and nice turns from supporting players (some of which sometimes border on caricature, though). What \\"Taking Woodstock\\" needs is a more strong portrayal of the protagonist, who is somehow the least interesting person in the film.
0385736002|4.0|I have one queston to all that have read this book. have you noticed that the name \\"Nicholas Flamel\\" have been mentioned with the first \\"Harry Potter\\" the sorrsers stone? becouse it is in there... just a thought:)

B004G6009U|5.0|I grew up in the age of great animated classics such as Beauty and the Beast and Lion King. It has been a long time since Disney has produced a movie that has even come close to the quality of their classics. This movie can be ranked with those movies and eventually become a classic. The detail in the animation is spectacular. The music is the high quality that you would expect from Alan Menken. The voice acting is great with the talents of Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi. The only problem is you will want to watch Tangled over and over again.
B000WQWPKA|1.0|The film is probably the ultimate \\"B\\" Sci-Fi movie of all time.  Growing up in the 60s I watched its predecessors from the 50s with endless enthusiasm (and still appreciate them).  So, despite its \\"flaws\\" I love the movie.    The Blu-ray edition of the movie is a different story.  The promise of the Blu-ray medium is betrayed in this release since it includes only the regular theatrical release and NOT the extended version that is available on DVD or any other goodies.  Why on earth NOT have both versions on the 50GB BR disc?      Worse still is that finding this out - for me at least - was at the cost of buying the Blu-ray version.      The film does look great on Blu-ray but since I have to keep my 2 disc DVD edition to have both versions I won't be able to streamline my collection and I'm not happy about that.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Thanks to Amazon for making each free for a day, I tried both SoundHound Infinity and Shazam Encore. I played the same song for each. Shazam couldn't ID it. SoundHound told me exactly what it was and listed other songs it might have been. SoundHound wins -- though it's twice as large an app.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I love Britney just like you so do something nice and by this new album Femme Fatale and make someone happy or why not yourself? I am very happy now because now I can listen to Britney Spears in my car and in my room or take it whit me to some friends. :) enjoy

B004SKHJF2|5.0|I've been a Shazam user since it's birth on the Android market.  Not once has it failed me-free version or Encore. It is absolutely flawless (and I've used it on several different devices and in several different sound environments).  I cannot imagine anyone even comparing this application to SoundHound free or Infininty. It doesn't even come close in regards to tagging (cannot find songs or just flat out tags them wrong!) If you're on the fence people... stick with Shazam!
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|Another Disney great.  My two year old loves Tinkerbell and this is a great story and fun movie to watch.  Even my 6 year old boy likes to watch this one.
B004SBX112|5.0|It's awesome without any advertising, which is the best part . It even continues from any saved data if you had the free app before. Amazing and addicting!
B002ZG98Z0|2.0|I didn't think there would be much of a plot, but there was and it was well acted for the most part.  Still only a 2 star movie.

B0042816YK|2.0|I did not read the book, but I know there was a lot to the story.  No way to cram it all into a movie and yet they had time for boring dance scenes that went on forever.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I ordered \\"UP\\" through Hastings.  It arrived very shortly in great condition.  I got it as a gift for my grandson and we all enjoyed this animation very much.  So far on Amazon I have not received a \\"used\\" book or video that has not been in  almost brand new condition.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I like the series featuring the Jesse Stone character by Robert Parker.  This is the first video in the made-for-TV series, I believe.  I did enjoy it quite a bit.  There's a minor thing -- maybe something about the pacing or this movie or something hard to describe that caused me to not like this video as much as I had liked the others.  But still, this is a very enjoyable DVD.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|the game was fun for the first few days. hit the 2nd set of boards and it will no longer open. i get a quick flash of black screen &amp; then nothing. original 2 still work fine. hoping for a fix but luckily it was free.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is the best angry birds yet. Retains same gameplay as the originals with much more advanced background scenes and atmosphere. Nice take on the birdcage theme to replace the pigs.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|I tried Shazam out using a variety of songs. They were as follows: Black Eyed Peas (Pump It), Blue Oyster Cult's cover of (Born to be Wild), The Bravery's (Split Me Wide Open), The Mighty Mighty Bosstones's (Last Dead Mouse), (The Bartender Song) and (The Impression That I Get), The Ting Tings (Shut Up and Let Me Go), and Titus Andronicus' (Richard II). The only song it did not recognize was Last Dead Mouse by the MMBT. That's pretty impressive if you ask me. The additional bonus is that the app also points you to Amazon MP3's music purchase service (and with the new Cloud Music service you don't even have to store the music on your phone if you don't want!).
0670022411|5.0|Simply, I could not put this down, and I'm not a big witch/vampire/fantasy romance fan. Scholarly, intensely well-written, and dense with vivid, quirky, fascinating characters and ideas, I loved it through and through. The next of the trilogy is to be released in 2012....is it too early to pre-order?
B001PB3RU8|5.0|All I can say is WHERE HAS FLORENCE BEEN ALL MY LIFE?  Her music is outstanding...I love the sound.  Her voice is reminiscent of Annie Lennox (in my opinion)...her energy is contageous and I can't get enough!  If you are hesitant, download a song or two...I recommend Cosmic Love, Drumming, Blinding or Rabbit Heart to start with.
B004SBX112|4.0|F'in hard game compared to others in the series... no wonder the birds are so angry. Overall, same cute gameplay style as previous AB's, just on crack.
B000816TCY|5.0|Days before a vacation was initiated our camera battery died.  A quick check on Amazon revealed where a replacement could be found.  Ordered it, it arrived in secure/padded packaging, was exactly what I'd ordered, and vacation began as scheduled.  Can always rely on Amazon and its affiliates to respond to the challenge!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|This is probably the only tv remake of a book series that I actually prefer over the books.  I love the changes in the plot that make it more interesting (and less confusing) that the book series.  I love watching these shows over again.  The actors are amazing (and just so good looking).  Great show.
031603438X|3.0|..that is all...well, maybe a bit more. Using Keith's spicy language:<br /><br />I read only two other \\"cr.ps\\" written by \\"blokes\\" of rock music (recently, self-mortifying, terrible \\"Clapton\\", and \\"Fleetwood--My Life and Adventures with Fleetwood Mac\\"-this one long time ago). You read one \\"sh.t\\" like that, and they are all the same, stupefying like the drugs described in them. Such memoirs essentially teach you nothing (except recipe for bangers by Keth). I guess these \\"mother.. f..kers\\" just want to make excuses for whatever they did (or did not) to their children, wives, friends, crew members and particularly other women. They try to say, \\"hey I was stupid, but I have grown up and am OK now, I feel sorry folks\\". Unfortunately it sounds often pathetic.<br /><br />Saying this, actually \\"Life\\" is better than two other titles mentioned above. Honestly, it is not bad writing, but I would suggest to keep this book out of teenagers' hands (if you have any kids at home).<br /><br />The most boring are sections of the book, when Keith is just a junkie constantly hiding his stash and looking for a john to have a shot.<br />Three stars: 1) for author's teenage life and experiments with guitars; 2) for his relations with other musicians (particularly in Jamaica) and with people close to him; 3) for sections describing how certain songs have been composed and recorded, big tours organized.<br /><br />Three books of this kind are more than enough... better stick to the music (if you like F.Mac, Clapton or Stones).

031603438X|4.0|Actually a must read for Stones fans IMO. Some interesting insight from Keith's perspective (obviously) of his life before, during and sometimes outside of the band. He does seem to have a pretty good recall of his version of events.  I say his version for the most obvious of reasons. I'm a longtime music fan and worked in the biz for 30 years. That said, I was never a \\"fanboy\\" of any band enough to follow the minute details of their antics off stage. So I really like to read autobios and bios of both musicians I admire and those who I just find their life stories to be interesting.<br /><br />Bottom line is that it's well worth your time and the cost of the book to read. I don't think Keith could have put this down on paper without the help of co-author James Fox.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|Britney Spears has returned with the REAL return we have all been waiting for with this \\"Femme Fatale\\" era. The album starts out with the smash hit \\"Till The World Ends\\" which definitely sets the tone for the entire record. The album is a wild, crazy, fun party record. This is the album you bump in your car EVERYWHERE you go or that you listen to when you're getting ready for a fun night out. Even though it is a massive club banger, there are a couple more midtempo tracks, like \\"How I Roll\\" and \\"Trip To Your Heart\\" which both surprisingly fit the album well. This deluxe edition includes 4 bonus tracks that could have also been on the standard edition, with the exception of \\"Don't Keep Me Waiting\\". Britney fans will eat this album up, but even non fans will enjoy it because it is actually just a fantastic dance pop album.
B003BVK2ZS|4.0|This book was a great read.  Best when it covered the world of both the Utah rare book store owner and enthusiast Sanders (who kind of plays detective) and the world of the book thief Gilkey.  In my opinion the author erred when she began following the thief, thereby upsetting and losing the trust (and that half of the story)of Sanders.  The story suffers when Sanders is no longer involved.
B004J4WQ46|4.0|Angles sounds like The Strokes are heading in a new direction. Whether you like this album or not will depend on how much you wish for them to continue dabbling in 80s synth sounds and pounding, monotonous rhythms. Overall, the album is pretty nice (imo.) It sounds kinda like Phrazes for the Young, which resulted from Julian Casablancas' solo career, so, if you're into that this should be a nice buy for you. Not totally amazing, but pretty good.
0141192429|5.0|I read this book several years ago, and when it was suggested for our book club I readily supported the pick. Not for the light reader it is long and the plot develops slowly, but it is well worth the time.  An excellent read!

B002QW7ALM|5.0|In all honesty, I had no idea what this movie was about when I bought it.I got it for three or four bucks at a movie store going out of business sale.I snatched up anything that looked like sci-fi or horror or both, because lets face it:it has gotten really hard to tell what will and will not be good in this genres recently.Sure there are obvious losers that tell you 98% of the plot(if you can call it that) in the trailer(s), but the rest get lost in the oversaturation of pure crap that is spewed out every year.I don't mind three or four dollars sucking as much as the 12 or so dollars I normally would pay.That said, I would gladly have paid more for this one.  The plot is a mixture of \\"humans ruined the world\\", themes of isolation,amnesia(not of the explosive variety sadly), and crazy monsters.Oh, and a timebomb of sorts.It seems to just keep adding up, with a good pace, a few twists, and pretty good acting.Also, a plus in my book, no child actors.Just people trying to survive through a mazelike race against time and monsters.  The scenes are shot with great angles,the backrounds are beautifully cold and almost colorless.Its dark but not TOO dark.Nothing actually seemed too off the wall or unbelievable, it had a style and everything introduced did not clash with or distract you from it.  One of my favorite things about this, and it is a key factor in making me angry when done incorrectly in many shows and movies as of late, is the whispering.You can hear it.I do not recall a moment where the volume increased or decreased in an annoying manner, and I am extremely grateful. Now to watch the rest of my cheap buys, and see if any will compare to this, and I doubt they will, and it makes me hate that I put this one in first.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book gained a lot of its early popularity based on a glowing recommendation by Stephenie Meyer (Twilight, The Host), but it has continued to thrive based on quality of the story and its ability to stand by itself in the same genre.  Although it is categorized as young adult fantasy, it is more closely related to Stephen King's The Stand than other typical vampire/fairie/werewolf novels.  I would also describe this book as a story of survival over romance or drama.  I have recommended Hunger Games to women and men of all ages and I haven't found a single person who read it and was not completely captivated.  I devoured this book in just a couple days because I simply could not put it down.
0312600844|3.0|Jonathan Franzen's novel, \\"Freedom,\\" is about the burden of choice in a democratic society that has disregarded its responsibilities to its citizenry and thereby failed to achieve its potential.  Franzen's world is one where the environment is deteriorating, colleges are turning out materialistic bimbos and bumbos, parents are self-absorbed and inattentive to their children, presidents lie to the electorate, and wars are waged without due consideration.  Satire notwithstanding, \\"Freedom\\" is also about the inability of people in this \\"free\\" society to establish and maintain reasonable, gratifying and lasting relationships.  Suggests Franzen, relationships  in the post modern world tend to reflect need and vanity rather than result from mature, intelligent decisions.  For that reason, many, such as Richard Katz, eschew commitment in much the same way the shallow social order ignores its responsibility to make the world a better place.  Unfortunately, most people would rather snatch experience for the illusory gains of self-gratification and materialism than dedicate themselves to self-improvement or worthwhile social causes.  Implies Franzen, it is the man who can love - wholly and unabashedly - who can restore balance to a world spiraling downward under the onslaught of greed, narcissism and limited awareness.<br /><br /> In terms of relationships, a notable exception to what is normally experienced in the post modern world is the seemingly unfathomable marriage of Patty and Walter Berglund, who serve as archetypes of urban living and modernity.  Hardly exemplary in terms of emotional development, they nevertheless are capable of allegiance to each other, even if that devotion is imperfect.  Alternately shallow and obtuse, the couple proceeds through their tired lives like well oiled machines, failing to acknowledge the psychological complexity of the modern world.  Nor do they grasp the inevitable disaster of their marriage because they have ceased to question the insubstantiality that surrounds them.  They are thus victims of an absurd world that is partially of their own making.  However, the paradox of the book lies in the love they have for each other, despite the chaos and dysfunction of their lives otherwise.  Alas for both of them their particular marital love is redemptive.<br /><br />For Franzen as for most satirists, twentieth century America is a debacle resulting from mistakes made by clueless people in their quests for fulfillment.  Perhaps the world has grown too complex for man with all his character limitations to make even the proverbial dent in its dysfunction.  Yet it remains  man's basic nature to attempt to make the most of his destiny, even as he recognizes the innumerable seeming insurmountable obstacles to happiness.  For Patty and Walter persistence in the face of defeat ultimately pays off, and what originally seemed an impossible union, develops into a lasting commitment as well as the ultimate compensation for their various disappointments.  In this sense, Franzen sketches a landscape from which man can glimpse the necessity of human commitment - for his own sake, for his seeds', and for society as a whole.  Franzen implies that despite man's inevitable mistakes, it is still his capacity to love -- however imperfectly -- that permits him any semblance of meaning and joy.<br /><br />One could argue that most of the characters in \\"Freedom\\" are clich&eacute;s, but that is the province of satire so we can give Franzen a pass in this area.  Much like Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy in \\"Bonfire of the Vanities,\\" Walter Berglund is a man who does not understand himself or others.  A man who originally had altruistic goals, he is now a lawyer, a stalwart card-carrying member of the establishment who has immersed himself in the keep-up-with-the-Jones' mentality of contemporary life.  Master of his castle, he fails to realize the dangers lurking in his own family until it is too late.  Since he doesn't understand his wife any better than he does himself, the family muddles through its confusing social landscape without support from each other.  Patty slides into depression; Joey, the spoiled son, escapes the control of both parents, and Jessica, the daughter, marches on valiantly, heedless of the dangers surrounding her.  All are lost in a frivolous, unsatisfying morass.  Patty, whose own family was dysfunctional and fragmented, has had no model for parenting and seeks in her son a friend and support rather than providing stability and understanding to him.  It is inevitable that she would lose his respect, and so she does.  Spoiled and selfish, he proceeds to make disastrous choices, always falling back on the loyalty of his high school girlfriend, whose devotion seems ridiculous in the light of the neglect he shows her.  Lacking a sense of identity much like his mother, too lazy to work toward improving herself, Connie is content to wait for Joey, much like a fifties woman waiting for her Prince Charming rather than develop her own brand of self-reliance.  Likewise, Joey's roommate at the University of Virginia seems similarly unmotivated to excel, as does his shallow and beautiful sister.  One is reminded of Wolfe's \\"lemon tarts,\\" all the vultures and hangers on in Manhatten-America.  Midwest Minnesota and Washington, D.C. are similarly worlds of flitting butterflies - preening and posing and without substance.  Of course, all these shallow hangers on are Republicans because Franzen cannot resist simplistic shots at what he perceives to be the promulgators of lies and manipulations.  To me this aspect was trite and a definite fault in the book.  The characters are indeed stereotypical and at times unbelievable in their lack of substance.<br /><br />Particularly so is Richard Katz, Walter's best friend at Macalester College.  Hard to swallow is the fact that this lothario continues to hold both Walter and Patty in esteem.  Until the end when he turns on them in a callous display of vengeance, he returns again and again to their home, presumably to feel the warmth of Walter's idealism and Patty's admiration.  Even as he cuckholds his friend he seemingly admires him and basks in the substance he seemingly manifests.  We may fall for this in the reading of the book, but ultimately it does not make sense.  Finally we must regard Richard Katz' behavior as the typical American tendency to use and discard people for one's own personal gratification.  That he is a rock star whose talent and lyrics continue to evolve does not make sense since he does not grow in any perceivable way in terms of character.  In fact, he remains childish and narcissistic until the end.  One could argue all the characters are alarmingly static, as if their life journeys have utterly failed to inform them.  Again, this is somewhat typical in satire, but even Sherman McCoy evolved enough to grasp his own mistakes and make his amends.  What Walter Berglund shows as character he has always possessed:  a capacity for loyalty beyond belief, and so it is with Patty as well, who although once a competitive athlete, withdraws into inactivity and depression.  Although she has always yearned for the passionate experience of being with Richard Katz, she ultimately tires of his ministrations and discards him.  This lends some substance to her character, all right, even if she remains fundamentally flawed.  People aren't perfect, Franzen must be reminding us, but if they can simply persist in their groping commitments, there is the possibility that relationships, families and society can prevail.  For in the final analysis, relationships are all there is for man in the post modern world.  Take it or leave it, Franzen suggests.  It is still those very commitments that render us capable of emotional survival in a world gone mad.<br /><br />The book is interesting, carefully crafted with different voices, and ambitious in theme and scope.  However, it is full of unnecessary sub-plots and diversions.  The format is sometimes awkward.  For example, the beginning prosaically tells the \\"story of the Berglunds\\" as if one needs the particular histories of Patty and Walter to understand the story as a whole.  The device of the \\"autobiographer\\" is somewhat intrusive and unnecessary as well since the story itself achieves that purpose.  The various overlapping points of view make the storyline repetitive at times.  One wants the book to be leaned down so that it's more digestible.  I found myself interested in Patty and Walter but not particularly so with the others as if their \\"stories\\" were appendages, novels in their own right rather than parts of the organic plot about the Berglunds \\"and the something that is odd about them.\\"  People are hardly ever what they seem so why is the line,\\"There has always been something odd about the Berglunds,'\\" expressed in the first place?  To achieve suspense?  It does so but only moderately.  In the end, \\"Freedom\\" is about the clich&eacute;d truths of relationships in modernity.  In fact, as Franzen implies, too much freedom has indeed resulted in triviality and self-absorption.  It is no wonder that so many drink, drug or retreat into depression.  \\"Life's the b-word\\" when you can't handle it, right?<br /><br />Marjorie Meyerle<br />Colorado Writer<br />Author of \\"Bread of Shame\\"ns again and again to their home, presumably to feel the warmth of Walter's idealism and Patty's admiration.

B004I2K4DY|4.0|I bought this DVD from Amazon. Good price. i love the performance, found it very entertaining.   I do prefer the stage setting. compared to the 10th anniversary setting. The performers get there cue and get out on stage, whereas the 10th anniversary stage, the cast were all sitting there in plain view. To me this arrangement was more attractive.   Now  the cast was interesting, there were a lot of young performers.   That was good   On the whole they did very well. i loved them all.    I do prefer the 10th anniversary cast. more mature and seasoned in vocals, and acting   I liked Lea better as Eponine, not Fantine. I would  recommend  buy  the 10th and the 25th Anniversary for you collection.

0142000655|5.0|I decided to read it because it was 1. a classic, and 2. on Oprah's book club list. This has been the nicest thing Oprah has ever done for me. Hands down the best book I have ever loved. I have re-read it many times over, and the emotions stirred each time are just as powerful as the first time. HIGHLY recommend.
0670022411|4.0|This is the story of a witch who is trying to ignore her powers and be a scholar instead, and the consequences of that choice. Along the way we meet vampires and other interesting magical creatures. The story is a long one - 579 pages in the AR version - and starts a bit slowly and with convolutions. I enjoyed the many revelations and eurekas throughout, although there was a bit more esoteric information about alchemy than seemed necessary. If one can tolerate the academic feeling at the first, the story itself is entertaining, and the characters delightfully three-dimensional and endearing. Overall a nice blend of suspense, romance and fantasy.
0756404738|5.0|I just now finished reading this book and I have to say that it was with regret that I did--I loved it that much.  I have read many of the reviews here and am a bit surprised at some of the one star reviews.  Granted, Kvothe's story did not progress as much as I thought it would but I really don't care because it was so beautifully written.  Also, it's true that it took Mr. Rothfuss a VERY long time to write it and it depresses me to think I have to possibly wait another four years for him to write the final installment.  However, reading both books has been such a joy for me.  If I'm going to have to wait this long to read a sequel, I want it to be LONG and MEATY and this book did not disappoint. I love his style of writing so much that I am willing to forgive the length of time it took him to write it and the lack of progression.  I can see how hard he worked on it and I applaud the care he took in writing it.  Now I have to figure out what I'm going to do with myself until he finishes the final part to Kvothe's story.
B004M66YSA|4.0|This is a great sophomore CD release effort by the talented alternative/indie rock band The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, simply titled 'Belong'. Unlike their debut 2009 self-titled album, the band's sound has evolved in 'Belong' to that which is reminiscent to bands like Blondie or Smashing Pumpkins among others, but this in a positive good way. The opening/title track \\"Belong\\" does give one a good overview of album sound : great melodic rock sound. My favourite track (and hence the title of my review) is \\"Anne With an E\\" : an incredible beautiful ballad. \\"Heart In Your Heartbreak\\", \\"The Body\\", \\"Even In Dreams\\", \\"My Terrible Friend\\" & \\"Strange\\" are all great tracks with quite a similar sound & song structure (and sound is quite similar to the song \\"Maria\\" by the band Blondie). \\"Heaven's Gonna Happen Now\\" has great lead guitar & vocals. The great melodic alternative tracks \\"Girl Of 1,000 Dreams\\" & \\"Too Tough\\" is another showcase how great this band is. There is no weak track to really talk of on this great CD 'Belong'. On overall, you have a well produced CD release by the talented rock band The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, a highly recommended CD listening.
030726999X|5.0|Many people have reviewed the book, I have not looked at all of them but all I have seen seem to think Lisbeth Salander is the main subject despite her absence from many pages. So who is the main character? About whom do all three books revolve? None other than Alexander Zalachenko, shot by Evert Gullberg,former head of The Section who has taken control of The Section and carried out his portion of it, then passed control to Clinton. Other books have had dead people, \\"Rebecca\\" is an example and \\"Treasure Island\\" uses Jim Hawkins as narrator but the book is not about him. Did Larsson know what he was doing when he wrote the three books? He intended to write more, he turned in a portion of a fourth but his family destroyed it upon his death and only let the three be published. Would Lisbeth continually increase her presence in future planned books? Can we guess a dead man's intentions? I was captivated by all three. However in the first I thought Blomkqvist was the chief character, he was in \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\"  but here he was relegated to a lesser role and Lisbeth gained prominence but her father, Zalachenko was more prominent in both of them and remained alive until Book Three.<br />In the final book and am I ever sad that it is final, I want more, he retains top billing. Nothing gets done that does not touch upon him, his son, Niedermann, was nothing without him; he needed his father's guidance to use his own abilities. Lisbeth was her father's twin, Zalachenko was evil incarnate, perhaps philosophy's absolute evil displayed in his belief that he could do whatever he wanted without fear of revenge and Lisbeth was almost the same except that her beliefs would be regarded as good, not evil. She went her own way, took her own revenge and asked no help. She got hurt, her father did not. He was powerful enough to bend Swedish government to his own wishes, \\"The Section\\" was devoted to extricating him from the consequences of his own actions, he never looked back, he just let those who were paid tp take care of him do so. Everything in all three books was traceable to some action of Lisbeth's father and her attempts to kill him were regarded as criminal, his actions were hidden or covered up even when the Cold War ended and he became a common criminal. Still The Section defended him. It was only fitting that the former head came back into service on his own decision and tried to cover all traces. Then the book hurtles on to its ending, not with Lisbeth but since Zalachenko is dead.And Blomkqvist's book details all this in an attempt to portray her in a true light. That made the book worthwhile.<br /><br />Tags:Stieg Larsson,Lisbeth Salander,Sweden,suspense,secret agencies, he just let those who were paid tp take care of him do so.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I loved the first two books in the series, but Mockingjay just didn't do it for me for the following reasons:    1. I started to really dislike Katniss. All she did in this book was whine, pout, or hide in a broom closet.    2. I feel like the writing was incredibly disjointed. There was so much potential for this book to be a phenomenal ending to the series but instead it was a waste of pages. The plot went all over the place, the dialogue was crap and the relationships that were so interesting got boring.    3. The ending sucked. It felt like she didn't really know how to end it so she just rushed through it. I'm glad she ended up with Peeta because I did start to root for him more than Gale, but it felt like the connection that they had was lost by the end of the book. He went from being crazy to marrying Katniss with not much in between.

0061766089|1.0|There are no practical suggestions you can implement in this book. What you get is a lot of conceptual high-level fluff, and thinly disguised self-promotion of the author's company. He keeps telling you how great his firm contribution to product design were, but never once does he mention if they made any difference to sales. In one case, he describes the customer who had commissioned the study as crying during the presentation - but you are left to wonder if she was deeply touched by it, or simply regretful over the money she had spent.

The most critical to me as an Aunt was that the materials that this item were made from were eco-friendly and non-toxic to the kiddos (as they tend to put everything in their mouth etc).  For more information on this company's practices, go to their website: [...]    It was a well received gift and the kids play with it often!
B003YNFYD8|5.0|The Beatles 1967-1970 aka The Blue Album contains their greatest hits from the years 1967-1970. The sound quality is crisp and clear and remastered very well.

B003YNFYCO|5.0|I've been a Beatles fan early this year and I'm getting to know a lot about The Beatles and their music. The Beatles 1962-1966 aka The Red Album contains their greatest hits from the years 1962-1966. Four songs are in mono mix and the rest are in stereo mix.

0061537969|5.0|This is a great read with something for everyone.  Don't worry, it's not really about auto racing, but about life and the things that are important to us.  Warning:  you may want to get a dog once you're done reading it!
0307477479|3.0|While I was reading this book, I was constantly struck by the fact that I was absolutely hating it.  Several times I was tempted to abandon it.  The characters were among the most despicable I have ever read:  young and middle aged people being immature and self-absorbed, completely oblivious to the pain they cause to everyone around them, particularly those who love them.  The few worthwhile, or rather not loathsome, characters that were introduced were fodder for the central characters.<br /><br />However, I stuck with the book, and something happened toward in the last couple of chapters.  I don't know if the characters grew on me, or if it was the way Ms. Egan had them mature and find some redemption in the end.  All I know is that at the moment I finished the book, I no longer hated it.  Sasha and Bennie grew and changed, and although I still find their behavior at the beginning (and middle) of the novel absolutely reprehensible, I was unable to work up the same level of dislike for them at the end.<br /><br />While I disliked the characters, I can find no flaw in Ms. Egan's style.  Even while I was hating the story, I found her prose to flow easily and I couldn't help wondering what it would have been like if she had written characters I actually cared about.<br /><br />I still can't quite say that I liked the book.  However, I didn't hate it.

B0037MNKDC|3.0|Sorry to say I began to watch this movie and had to pause it.  I forgot about it and never saw the remainder of the film.  To me it was a little graphic but I didn't view the whole movie so I can't really criticized it.
B001BNFR6W|2.0|Sad. Oh so very sad. I love this show, it is amazing, and when I saw this complete series box set on this website, I was sooo happy! It's so cute! It's a box! Haha. It's colorful, and reallllly nicely packaged (the only reason I gave it 2 stars) but when I put it in my DVD player and realized how much of it wouldn't work (be it episodes or special features) I was so upset. I already had a few of the seasons on DVD, and realized they had some glitches.. I figured they would have redone the discs for this box set, it wouldn't have the same problem, and id have the complete series! So when I had returned it (got a refund, they wont rip you off on that, thankfully)I was so upset. I also hated to see that there were so many customer reviews telling me not to buy this.. why I didnt scroll down and read customer reviews before hand, Ill never know. I also hate to see that this website, as well as others, are still selling it. IT DOESNT WORK. I say take it off store shelves, and take it off websites until they remake the discs to work properly, and rerelease this set. Sucks to.. I loved it.. even made room on my shelf = ( = P.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Listener interface and functionality are primitive at best.  If you're just into uploading mass quantities of stuff and cramming it in the \\"attic\\" for safekeeping I guess it's okay, if pricey, but if you're hoping to actually use this thing to listen to music and customize your listening experirence, wait for something hopefully much, much better.
B0010SKUYM|2.0|Kvothe's easy escape from poverty (really, just sell a book and take a bath) was irksome, but not nearly as much as the way Mr. Rothfuss writes Denna, the \\"love interest\\" of the story.  The problem here is that Denna is written in a way that is frankly juvenile.  Not that the character is juvenile, but the way Mr. Rothfuss writes her is clumsy and distracting.  It would be better if she was a human being instead of an adolescent male fantasy.  She's presented as a super-attractive, mysterious, elusive figure.  Basically, the kind of woman imagined by men who don't really interact with a lot of women.     I don't mean to be hard on Mr. Rothfuss - for all I know his personal relationships with women are normal and healthy.  But he can't write female characters.  It is as if he becomes a thirteen year old boy when presented with the task of composing a scene that has a woman in it.  Much of his otherwise clear and vibrant prose actually turns cringe-worthy the moment a lady is present.  And it kills the story.     I enjoy the first person narration and I don't mind the focus on Kvothe.  It is a refreshing break for the typical fantasy novel parade of multiple protagonists, and the structure of the story is actually quite fascinating.  To a certain extent I can live with the one dimensional nature of the minor characters who inhabit his world.      A lot of people compare this book to Harry Potter.  Mr. Rothfuss certainly has a more nimble pen, but honestly he fumbles when it comes to characters.  Hemme is a bland version of Snape.  Ambrose is a bland version of Malfoy (imagine a bland version of a bland character!)  Kvothe's friends are so indistinct that I can't even recall their names.       This is a disappointing book.  I wanted to love it.  But the flaws are deep.  The Name of the Wind promises you an intriguing, well thought out world rich with vibrant detail and life.  Unfortunately, what it delivers is a flat and ultimately lifeless.

192076920X|5.0|Gregory David Roberts has the most mature and interesting voice of any writer of our time. This is a book that anyone could read, and everyone would find interesting. It stimulates both the intellect and the heart. This is the second time in my life, after Dostoevsky, that I have felt so much gratitude to an author for having written what he did.
0756405890|4.0|I found this book an enjoyable read.  It gives the reader a rich understanding of the fantasy world, while not boring them with facts.  The storyline was rarely ever flat, and it always used a variety of themes to flavor the plot.  Overall, this story is like a darker, more intense version of Harry Potter.  The realism and grittiness described in many parts of the book makes the main character, Kvothe, easier to relate to.  My one criticism would be the excessive hype at the beginning of the book.  This book acts as a setting for the (hopefully) even more enjoyable books to come.    I certainly recommend this book if you like fantasy or adventure.  A solid 4 stars.
630463949X|5.0|I would not consider myself a Fleetwood Mac fan, but when their songs would come on the radio, I would not change the station, so I guess you can say I enjoy their music. I purchased this DVD on a whim and LOVE it! I've watched it many times over the past couple of weeks that I've owned it and I've been really impressed with the quality of the live performance. I guess now I am a Fleetwood Mac fan!
B004G6009U|5.0|So, my daughter has been waiting for this Blu-ray since we saw it in the theater. We pre-ordered it as soon as it was available for us to do so. We got it yesterday, 3/29, watched it...we all loved watching it at home, mainly because she loves to dance to all the music and was not able to do so in the theater. Both are great..theater and home for different reasons of course. The storyline is sweet, sad, scary and brave. Most kids will not experience what she did, but the magical connection between Rapunzel and Eugene was written very well. You will thoroughly enjoy this movie by Disney!    On another note, I want to give Amazon.com some credit, they gave me a guaranteed low price if I pre-ordered and I just got my $8 refund. Thanks for keeping your promise!
0756404738|5.0|I was well and pleased to discover this book has lived up to the first. Although there are still times when I scoff slightly at Kvothe's luck and unfailing \\"perfect at everything he persues\\" character build, the story is rich in wit and clever telling. There are some sudden plot direction changes thrown in, however the experiences are very interesting and help to portray the main character as the more worldy protagonist telling the story back. After I finished the pleasurable read of Name of the Wind, I was sure Patrick couldn't one-up himself, but I think this tale has a much more diverse flavor to it. The wondorusly invented cultures, unique characters, and unfolding of events coupled with Rothfuss' clever writing will have you reading this book for hours at a time. A fantastic read. That being said, I still haven't even read the last 50 pages or so!
B004ETVAH0|5.0|One of the things that separated Jeff Beck from the pack of merely talented guitarists, from the beginning, was his sense of humor.  On his first album as a leader, \\"Truth\\", his humor joined with his virtuosity to help recreate the vocabulary of rock guitar.  Beck knew that rock 'n roll was about fun, not pretentiousness.    That's why it's such a hoot to hear him returning to his roots with \\"Rock and Roll Party\\".  After all, Les Paul was himself such an innovator in regards to the guitar, jazz and pop music, and Beck always acknowledged his influence.     All the tunes on this album are classics, and all of them had an effect on Beck during his formative years.  Beck treats them with such respect, and in his hands they all sound as brilliant as they did when they first caught people's ears on Fifties radio sets.  \\"Sleepwalk\\" (originally done by Santo and Johnny on a lap-steel guitar), \\"Train Kept a Rollin'\\" (nodding to Jeff's days with the Yardbirds), and the dazzling set of Paul and Ford tunes (\\"Bye Bye Blues\\", \\"Tiger Rag\\", \\"How High the Moon\\" and on and on)---they're all wonderful.    Irish singer Imelda May is nearly perfect in the role of Mary Ford (Les Paul's vocal collaborator).  Listeners shouldn't be confused by the fact that she harmonizes with herself on a live recording--it's done with the help of a machine created for that purpose, and it meshes perfectly with the pioneering spirit of Les Paul, who created many technology-enhanced sounds.  May also really shines on her encore with the torchy, dramatic \\"Walking in the Sand\\".    Nobody else but Beck could have made this album... Other guitarists may have the chops and the facility with the twang bar, but Beck was the first and nobody beats him for panache.    The bonus cd ain't bad, either.
0393330435|4.0|This book was a good read, and I applaud Steve for including examples of how certain technologies worked or how his contraptions worked, it was dry but he is a techie nerd. It gave good lead up to the creation of the first personal computer, but he never went in depth, and he barely referenced his best friend Steve Jobs or how the relationship fell apart. Nor did he go into any kind of detail of Apple Computers, or how he adjusted to becoming a bazillion air overnight. I like this book because I grew up in the time of personal and home computers, but for most people I don;t think they would enjoy the book as much.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|\\"Femme Fatale\\" Deluxe is a fantastic album by Britney Spears that contains tracks that have a high energy dance beat.  I also do agree that the bonus tracks are fantastic.  I thought that both her \\"Blackout\\" and \\"Circus\\"  albums were good.  However, in my humble opinion, Britney has gotten even better with this album.  This \\"Femme Fatale\\" Deluxe edition contains songs that are of the dance/pop genre (many of these musical tracks can be played at a party, and I'm certain are going to be played at many clubs). My personal favorite musical tracks on this album are \\"Hold it Against Me\\", \\"Gasoline\\", \\"I Wanna Go\\", and \\"Trip to Your Heart\\".  \\"Hold it Against Me\\" is a song about aggressively going after someone that interests you, and bluntly telling them how you feel. \\"I Wanna Go\\" is a very daring and racy dance song about wanting to follow through on some \\"desires\\" running through the mind. \\"Gasoline\\" is my overall favorite of this collection and is a fun song about a person that ignites a strong sensual attraction that they create a feeling of passionate excitement (hence the lyrics you set me on fire).  In a positive way, \\"Gasoline\\" is the 2011 version of Madonna's musical gem that is titled \\"Burning Up\\". \\"Trip to Your Heart\\" is an uplifting song that shows the more romantic and sensual side of Britney. \\"Trip to Your Heart\\" appears to be about pursuing someone that you care about.  The best way to tell if you are going to enjoy this selection is if you have listened to, and enjoyed any of the following songs: \\"Radar\\", \\"Circus\\", \\"Rock Me In\\", \\"Break the Ice\\", and/or \\"And Then We Kiss\\".  I would also recommend this collection for those who enjoy dance and/or pop music.

I downloaded it on my kindle, so I cant even get the satisfaction of throwing it away.  We read this for our book club and 7 out of 9 disliked or hated this book. It has extremely weak writing. The author might me a professor at a university, but she certainly doesn't know how to write dialog or create an interesting story.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|I never pay more than $4 for a book.  There are so many great stories out there for less.  So, I was delighted when I found this Lisa Gardner book for $1.    \\"Alone\\" is a fast paced action / suspense thriller.  It is full of complex characters, relationships and situations - like life - but not slowed down by too many details.  There are no angels in this book, but plenty of demons. Even so, I had no problems relating to the hero of this story.  I identified with the way he questioned himself, his motives and his judgement.      I won't tell you the story because I think you'll want to read it yourself.  It is a fresh story line and fun to read.  I will be watching to see if any more of Lisa's books drop into my price range.

B001HN694K|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There are some good elements, but it's as Burton played up all the junk and nearly hid the good stuff. Depp is just blandly unlikable. Why would anyone want to make Anne Hathaway look so ugly? Things start out promising, but once the rabbit hole if breached it's tripe central. Things improve slightly as more actual humans enter the story... wait, did I say story? Sorry, none here. A Lord of the Rings style dragon fight? Really. This film makes Dumb and Dumberer look like Kurosawa.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|The interface is not quite as slick, nor does it appear to have a way to stream samples of songs to see what's hot, probably saving time as well as steering me to music i might want to buy. 500kB smaller installation than soundhound (2MB) even after sd, but right now, I'd prefer capabilities over size.

B001EN71DG|5.0|What you get with the 2008 edition is 3 slim line cases for each respective film. The slim line case has the newest version of the film on one disc and a second disc with the original version so in total 2 discs per movie with a total of 6 discs.    I just watched them all this week and I gotta say for how much you pay and what you get it is a very good value. I am so glad I found this boxset to replace my VHS copies of the original films! Plus it is fun to take a look at the edits on these movies despite some that are a bit controversial.  On a note of caution, the outer box is not the best quality so be careful.
B000EHQTZO|2.0|The film was grainy in some parts and not as sharp as I expected.<br />I was dissatisfied with this purchased film.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Have you ever gotten to the last 100 pages of a book and found yourself wishing there was more? I just did with \\"Fall of Giants\\" by Ken Follett. This sweeping historical novel, set in the early 20th century, is the first of a planned Century Trilogy, which follows several fictional families throughout the years. The clearly drawn characters, a hallmark of Follett's writing, interact with historical events and true historical figures, giving an insight into how it felt to be there as the First World War broke out, along with all the social changes that happened in the first quarter of the century.    Being a history buff certainly added to my enjoyment of this epic novel, but I don't think it would be required for everyone else.I enjoyed seeing some of the little known background behind some of the historical events, but I got deep into the individual characters and their stories and how they connected to each other in sometimes circular ways. From a coal miner in Wales to a Russian peasant to an English lord, the people seem real and their lives proceed like everyone's does, with unforseen coincidences and unexpected results of their decisions.    I highly recommend this novel, and eagerly look forward to the next.

B003PIUC02|4.0|I just spent the last two days watching the series from beginning to end.  I heard good things about it, and found it on DEEP discount at a used DVD store.      While I like visually-stylized things, the style of the series seemed over-done in the first couple episodes. I was getting incredibly bored with the constant punctuation of epic blood splatters, hyper CGI, slow motion, etc.  But I stuck with it because I paid for it...     And I'm glad I did.      I'm only giving it four stars because I pretty much hated the first episode.  Yes, I know the style was meant to look like a graphic novel (which I actually did NOT know before I started watching).  I'm not offended by cursing, but at first the use of cursing seemed more gratuitous than honest.    Once the series got into the meat of the actual story past just splattering the camera with blood, I really liked the series.

B000NA2BEU|5.0|The third and final season of Veronica Mars is still really good television. While some might say that it wasn't that great i would agree that the show changed and had low moments in season three. But even at it's lowest Veronica Mars is still ten times better than anything on television these days.The season picks up with Veronica attending Hearst college and settling in with boyfriend Logan. Most of out favorite characters from Neptune high also now go to Hearst including Wallace, Mac and Dick.  Along with some new character Mac's pretty party girl roommate Parker and Wallace's  funny rocker roommate Piz who takes in interest in Veronica very early on. The structure of season is a little different than it's predecessors. Instead of the season-long mystery arc that they did in seasons one and two. Season three takes a different approach with a mystery revoling around a serial rapist at Hearst countinuing on from the season two episode \\"The Rapes of Graff\\" which takes up the first 9 episodes of the season. The conclusion of the rape brings on a murder of a prominent member of the Hearst faculty which lasts 6 episodes and the final five episodes consist of stand- alone mysteries. While the change in structure while not the best, the stories are still entertaining and engaging. If you don't think the season was that good the final fives episodes redeem any wrong doing including the final two episodes of the series which were season one quality. Relationships change and grow and people change as they continue to grow up but Veronica remains a butt kicking awesome detective. I recommend the final season of this unfortunately short lived series they was gone way too soon you won't regret it
0812550706|5.0|This book was a fantastic read.  It was of a perfect length to be both engaging and satisfyingly time-consuming.  I would strongly recommend (as I have to many already) this book to any literate being.  The work of the author is as inspirational as it is thought-provoking.   Ender Wiggin, the subject of this book, is fascinating in his own way.  He is a brilliant general, skilled combatant (as he proves over and over), and kind person.  These traits are magnified with the realization that he has lived but 8 years.  It is quite amusing to contrast the character of Ender to that of the standard 8-year-old.     The plot of Ender's Game was a rollercoaster ride of emotion.  Fear, anger, jubilation, and pride can each be experienced.  It was not romantic in its portrayal of the destruction that unfolds.  Then again, this is a science-fiction novel, and it is unlikely that the reader will lament any lack of romantic activity.  In fact, the author's writing style gave nearly constant insight into the thoughts of the characters, which was fascinating and exciting as the plot developed.     Overall, I found this book to be one of my all-time favorites.  Ender's Game was recommended to me by a friend, and I hope that this review will urge others to experience the book for themselves.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|The second season of this amazing drama starts off three months after the events of the first but through fastbacks tells the events of the summer including the reveal of the cliffhanger from season 1. A mysterious crash of a school bus carrying several Neptune high a bus that Veronica was suppose to be on is the central mystery of the second season. Along with a mystery revolving a suspicious stabbing involving Logan and members of the PCHers.The second season adds some new and exciting characters to the cast. One is narcissic rich boy Dick Casablancas and his smart tortured little brother Cassidy (Beaver). Along with a new love intrest for Wallace, Jackie the sassy daughter of a rich and famous baseball player. While Veronica works on discovering who crashed the bus she also deals with day to day mysteries involving people at her high school.Changes also are afoot in Neptune as we say goodbye to a longtime character and a death of a heavily reccuring character from season 1 also Keith takes another shot at running for Sheriff after being asked to run by Steve Guttenburg's creepy character Woody the new mayor of Neptune. Everything comes to a head durring graduation when Veronica finally discovered who blew up the bus which leads to a standoff with said person and leads to a shocking conclusion. The second season is probably my favorite of the series with great moments and a wonderfully blended cast it truly is one of the best pieces of television i have ever seen and i highly recommend it.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|How does one even start to review what is easily the most anticipated book of the year among urban fantasy fans? I guess I will start by saying, if you want to read my reviews of the previous books go here. If you haven't read the series, you might want to stop and start at book 1. I'm not going to be purposely spoilerly, but it is hard to be entirely vague.<br /><br />I've been a bit overwhelmed with book choices lately. After reading almost nothing for the last few months because of school, all of a sudden I have a \\"to read\\" list that is crazy huge almost solely because of popular series books I have missed the release of. I pushed all of those aside and bought my kindle version of Shadowfever at midnight on release day. I read for about 2 hours for that night before I had to finally admit defeat and get some sleep.<br /><br />Right out from the gate the book has you twittering \\"OMG! NOOOOOO\\". There were several oh my god moments really. One thing Moning did incredibly well was keep us on our toes. There was not a single event in this story that I had guessed or seen suggested by anyone else. The twists and turns were thought provoking and frustrating all in one. In the end we get answers to some questions, but definitely not all. We get just enough about Barrons and his men to feel slightly satisfied, but still curious. We get in-depth history as well as out of nowhere curve balls regarding the Fae and Mac's sidhe-seer heritage. We get the long awaited answer to Alina's death and the future of Mac and Barrons.<br /><br />Yet, I finished it was left feeling unsettled. Shadowfever is a lot of book, almost 600 pages, and honestly the first half it was a slow read. There was a great deal of emotional monologue and stubborn characters that dragged on the plot. Additionally, I've always adored Dani but I felt her character lacked growth in this installment and I can't help but wonder whether or not the reveal we get was planned all along. I didn't fully believe the events surrounding V'lane and I still don't understand Christian's progression. I almost think that the effort to create a story that lived up to expectation and defy all speculation may have led to an end result that lacked a certain amount of credibility. (I know that's vauge, I'm sorry! lol).<br /><br />My last complaint, too much of the finale was focused on the relationship between Barrons and Mac. Yes, their \\"happy ever after\\" chances are a huge draw to readers, but it is has never been the focus of the series. For me the series has always been about Mac and her search to find the truth about her sister, to find her place among this new world she has journeyed into. I needed a final scene between Mac and the killer.<br /><br />I realize how one sided this review is. The truth is for all my complaints, it is an entertaining and good story. Mac 5.0 is broken down and then built up stronger and smarter than we have ever seen her. Barrons is everything we have come to expect from him and most people will be content with the series ending. Shadowfever may not have hit all the perfect buttons for me, but I enjoyed the creatively twisted story that kept me guessing and am sad to see the series come to an end.nd I still don't understand Christian's progression.

B000A59PMO|5.0|Alright, so this will be my second time watching the entire series of Veronica Mars in less than a month. It's just as good the second time around. The first season starts with tough cynical social outcast Veronica as she meets new friend Wallace. We come to learn that her best friend Lily Kane was murdered and after her dad the amazing Keith Mars accused her father billionaire Jake Kane of the murder her friends turned against her and her mother walked out on them. She is also dealing with lingering feelings for her ex and Lily's brother Duncan who broke up with Veronica unexpectedly prior to Lily's death. Within the first couple episodes the series starts to take shape and you begin dieing to know the big question  \\"Who killed Lily Kane?\\". The series is supported by an excellent cast. Most notably Jason Dohring as Logan Eckolls who's witty one liners steal the show. Another stunning contributor is Francis Capra as Weevil the tough biker who frequently helps Veronica out. A big part of the series is the relationship between Veronica and her dad which is sweet and fun. I am telling you once you start to watch it will become an obsession. As the season comes to a close ememies become friends and friends become new ememies and the true killer of Lily Kane is revealed in the shocking season finale and a nice cliffhanger to leave you guessing. Once your done you won't be able to wait to watch season two i highly recommend this show to anyone willing to watch. My only complaint is that you'll get angry that it only lasted three seasons but heres to hoping they can get a movie made.
B0036S4C6G|3.0|I have tried to read this novel twice (I did, after all, pay for it) and just can't seem to slog through it.  The reason is that I just don't care about the characters.  Maybe I'm a bozo, but the writing is just not good enough to overcome the shallowness of the characters.  I don't have to like the characters to care about them.  In the case of this novel, there just didn't seem to be enough there there.
0765356147|5.0|The Hero of Ages is the third book and the conclusion of the Mistborn series, by Brandon Sanderson.    This is an old-style fantasy series - the books tell a single long story and you must complete the trilogy to get any sense of closure. The initial Mistborn book was of a standard length but the second book was almost twice as long, which surprised me in a publishing culture focused on keeping books \\"a reasonable length\\". Sanderson commented on his blog: \\"When I'd turned in Mistborn 2 (revised and already trimmed) at 250k, production and marketing had nearly had a fit, complaining that the book would cost more to print than it would make.\\" Personally, I was thrilled to see that the books told one long interwoven story (although Sanderson did repeat key elements in order to refresh the readers' memories) rather than a half-hearted attempt to make the novels stand alone.    As I was reading the second book, I wondered if the series could be shortened - subplots dropped out and the story streamlined. I'm pleased to say that when I reached the end of the trilogy, the Hero of Ages, I was not disappointed.    It is important to me that a fantasy world hangs together and there is no inexplicable magic without an explanation and basis. I will accept the most fantastical of elements but they must have a logic and once rules of the world are established, those rules need to hold true. Sanderson uses this to his advantages. Rules are broken and his fantasy physics act erratically but in every instance the characters are more shocked than the reader is, and there is a strong focus on finding out why the world isn't acting as it should. Never was anything dismissed with a wave of the hand and thus the author kept me reassured that he wasn't going to forget his own world-building for the sake of plot.    The magic system within the book is clever and incredibly detailed. My 14-year-old son (who has enjoyed the first two books of the series and is waiting for me to relinquish thethird to him) was completely intrigued by the \\"science\\" of the magic and we enjoyed long discussions about the properties and effects of different metals and possibilities for taking advantage of them.    The ending to the story is surprising but Sanderson has been building up to his conclusion steadily throughout the series. The slow progression of separating the truth from the Lord Ruler's lies is skillfully shown and as reader, we learn to distinguish between witnessed information (what we've actually seen through the characters' eyes) and 3rd-party information (told to the characters without direct experience). Sanderson shows real talent by retaining our trust: the author remains completely reliable through-out a story filled with half-truths and misinformation. I shared in the frustration of the characters but at no point did I feel the rug was pulled out from under me.    More importantly, at the climax of the story, everything mattered. Perhaps there were threads that could, under duress, have been left out but at the end of the story, the strands came together and I think I must have said \\"Ohhhh...\\" out loud as the final pieces of the mystery of the Hero of Ages clicked into place. I think every major question that I had was answered. I can't help but suspect that Sanderson wrote twice as much as we have seen in order to bring these books so perfectly to a climax.    My only complaint is that I didn't feel the strong emotional connection to the characters as I had in the first book. I would go so far as to say that the promise of the first book, with its incredible heist driven by the exuberant personality of Kelsier, is not fulfilled by the rest of the trilogy. But by the time I realised that we were drifting away from the initial adventure, I was already so entranced by the world and its magic, I was willing to be led into a new direction. Unravelling the secrets of the Hero of Ages ending up being a mythic tale than a fantastical romp but I felt contentand sated at the finale. Still, the only character I could imagine taking out for a beer was the one done away with at the end of the first book.    Brandon Sanderson has done detailed chapter annotations for Book 1 and 2 on his Mistborn Trilogy Portal which makes for a fascinating read of the story in progress as well as shed light onto Sanderson's thinking process.    I had previously read Firstborn, a novella by Sanderson which is available to read or download on Tor.com. I had glanced at the web page, planning to print out the story if it looked to be any good, and found myself riveted to the screen. I bought the initial Mistborn book as a result of this experience and went into it with high hopes. Having finally completed the trilogy, I can say that Brandon Sanderson did not disappoint.
0887308589|5.0|Before starting my own business a few years back I was a cubicle dwelling technical project manager with a bird's eye view of the craziness in three Fortune 500 companies. Mr. Adams absolutely nailed it - ALL of it. If you have ever worked in Corporate America you should take a good long look at this book. It is often like reading the diary you wish you had kept.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|But now that I've gotten it, I'm loving it. A really nice alternative to Angry Birds when you can't take those damn pigs any more. I don't normally like games, but this one rocks.
B0048IMZMG|4.0|I really enjoy Taylor's third album. It's much different than the first two in that there is not as much of a country feeling to her songs. For this reason, I prefer Fearless.<br /><br />Love all of her albums, but wishing she'd bring some more country soul back!
B004KSQN7C|2.0|I hope my comment is taken in the spirit of constructive criticism in which it is intended and not anything else... \\"Femme Fatale\\" is a big disappointment to me. I think if one just listens to the music without looking at the cover, the new and over processed album sounds like it was by Britney & The Chipettes. I don't hear anything on FF in the same promising league with \\"Lace & Leather\\", \\"Out From Under\\" and \\"Unusual You,\\"tunes I have on my webradio station...As well as Ms. Spears herself, many fans aren't teenagers any more and are moving on with their lives. I hope to hear future music from Ms. Spears that reflects the latter and for better luck next time...     .
0525423273|4.0|I was not expecting to love this book as much as I did.  It is cute, quick, witty, and fun. At first I was annoyed at Anna and her complaints about being \\"shipped\\" off to Paris - who wouldn't want to be in Paris?! At the same time, having gone through a Study Abroad myself, I felt for her being homesick.  After Anna's initial fears she starts to find her own niche both within herself, a new school, a new boy, and new friends.  What makes Anna real is that while she may have found a \\"niche\\" she questions things, like any teenager does (and adults at that matter).  Once Anna finds that being in Paris in not that bad, she finds herself doing things she never would have, stepping outside of her personal shell so to speak.  Then there is the boy... the boy that makes your stomach do flips and sentences no longer make sense.<br /><br />Of course what would a Contemporary Romance set in Paris be without the 'Boy'.  Etienne St. Claire - what can you say about him except SWOON - not only is he from Paris but he has that cute English accent.  Stephanie Perkins has created the perfect boy in an imperfect way (if that's possible).  Just like any teenage boy he can't make up his mind! He thinks he knows what he wants but doesn't really, all the while acting as if he does.  Such a boy thing!!<br /><br />Unlike many Contemporary Romance novels, Anna and the French Kiss is believable and realistic.  While Paris may seem to be the most perfect setting for relationships, Stephanie Perkins shows how unperfect relationships can be, no matter in what setting - even in the Romance Capital of the World.  Anna and the French Kiss is real.  The main characters, the secondary characters (who I love by the way - they are hilarious! and really make the book what it is), problems and even the outcome - - all are realistic.<br /><br />This is a perfect book for anyone who loves Contemporary Romance and/or is looking for something different outside of the Paranormal Romance novels.  Once you start the first few chapters you will have a hard time putting down this book.ers you will have a hard time putting down this book.
0307454541|4.0|Like most of you I picked this up to see what all the ballyhoo was about...Listening to one too many quips like 'Lisbeth kicks honeybuns'.  Ok, so what's it all about?<br /><br />In a word, melodrama.  But I have to admit that it was a very enjoyable read. Not at all challenging.  And not at all what I expected...given Larsson's journalistic beat covering Scandanavian organized crime (gee, there's an oxymoron!) I expected intrigue, spies, and corporate shenannigans. Not much of that.  I must say, they're going to have to beef up the screen play when Daniel Craig dons the Blomkvist persona, there's not enough in the 600+ pages to keep a movie crowd on the edge of their seat.<br /><br />I think one of the reasons this book has been so successful here in the U.S. is the exotic locale, and the degree to which the author makes use of it in the book.  Probably the best thing to happen to Swedish tourism since ABBA broke with Waterloo in '74.  It made me WANT to color my hair blond, pop blue contact lenses in my eyes and GO to Sweden.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and recommend it.  I will probably read the two follow-ups. But I'm not as hell-bent on making sure I get it done ASAP.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|who cares? easy to pick up, easy to put down. my kids love it. pass some time while I am bored waiting. why does every game need unlockables and character depth. this is a game for your phone and as such does a wonderful job.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Real nice backpack love all of the storage pockets. I can carry my GPS, power supply 17\\"XLP Dell fits real well. I feel good about storing CDs/DVDs with out dammage. Real good price from Amazon.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Better graphics and more of the same angry birds craziness.  Runs very well on cm7 htc inspire.  Also runs well on stock sense.  Highly recommended but some older devices may have issues with the improved graphics.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game is great, and its a shame that some of these ignorant reviewers are giving one star for stupid reasons that have NOTHING TO DO with the game.
B000UAFDP2|1.0|I have 3 different Blu Ray players (all less than a year old) and this thing won't play on any of them! I drove myself crazy trying to jump threw all the hoops they want you to including configuring firmware updates.  As I read in the Blu Ray player reviews, YES it's a nightmare to configure a wireless set up to get firmware updates not user friendly at all.    The bottom line is, by the time I got threw the last hoop Amazon said I couldn't return it cause I was out of the return period.    I would stay away from this Blu Ray unless you are interested in a real expensive small Frisbee.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|The computer I used to keep my music files stopped working a few months ago.  Fortunately, the music files and picture files were still readable.  Now I no longer have to worry about backup and I can buy music from any device, not just my home computer.

B004SBS8LA|3.0|This was a great app until it wouldn't open anymore.:-( My child and I had fun playing this, but won't load now. I wish I knew why. Help!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Other than saying I really enjoyed the book, I don't know what to say.  It was interesting history about indentured servants and how they were essentially treated like slaves.  The story comes full circle and it's very interesting how you can be in position one minute and another position a second later.  I don't want to spoil the book that's why I'm being so vague.  The characters are wonderful, the scenery is beautiful and the story is love and tragedy all in one.  A great read overall.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Great cd, but the cover to the cd was crack when I open the package , it could have been the way the post office handle the package... but I was very happy with my CD..
B004SBS8LA|1.0|i loved this version of Angry birds (especially the monkeys!) and played successfully for a few days. now the app is missing from my icon list / phone menu and i have to go into the amazon app store to search for and open it. i didn't delete it, so why is the icon missing?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Better then the original. Can't wait for the continual updates. Don't know why people are giving this game less than 4 stars. This game is well made and has awesome levels. This game is worth 5 stars.

I have heard this album so many times and i remember the chaos and passion when it was first released. This is the best grunge album ever. And Smells like a teen spirit is a unique master song that will be heard forever. The production is amazing the tracks music vocals are amazing. What are you waiting for. Just buy this album
1450400957|5.0|As a past buyer and huge fan of [[ASIN:0736092269 Strength Training Anatomy-3rd Edition]] and [[ASIN:0736048138 Women's Strength Training Anatomy]], I am delighted with this book which will enhance my home workouts by bringing Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Delavier's unparalleled illustrations together with hundreds of full-color photos, solid workout advice, and training programs.<br /><br />Numerous sports anatomy books have been released following the success of Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric's STA. Some of these like [[ASIN:0736062785 Yoga Anatomy]] are really good, but too many copycats offer only lackluster illustration or - worse - lifeless computer drawing. Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric's illustrations offer the best-of-the-best. They are detailed, informative, and a truly cut above the others.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as an addition to any fitness library.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|My friend had me listen to Adele and watch her video, she is very talented and has a strong beautiful voice.  Not every song on this CD is great but most of them are.  Definately a good purchase.  My husband just bought Adele 19 and we will see how she was at 19.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I'd heard wonderful things about the series, some even going so far as to warn me, \\"You will never be able to enjoy another series of books with the same fervor because those books are THAT good.\\" It is so true that the minute I finished reading a A Game of Thrones, I headed to the Kindle Store to download A Clash of Kings.<br /><br />The very first chapter of this book sucked me in with a chilling promise of fretful darkness in a world where you can't just turn on the lights to get away from the shadows. Set in a time and place not unlike medieval Europe, the narrative is divided chapter by chapter, allowing us to enter into several of the book's critical characters and follow the thread of their journey. As difficult as it might seem to take us on this trip through the eyes of at least nine different characters, Martin manages to weave the entire story together fluidly, and not once did I find myself feeling lost or confused when the POV shifted with a new chapter.<br /><br />Every character that lent voice to the story drew me into their world and made me feel for them, even the dwarf Tyrion Lannister, with his dark view and blatant honesty in a world all-to-unwilling to see the truth. Bran Stark became a favorite character early on, as I watched the world grow dark and tainted to his child's eyes, but failed to snuff the flame of the adventurer inside him. I quickly fell in love with Princess Daenerys Targaryen, whose older brother pushed her around all her life, threatening and mistreating her until she rose and found the power of the dragon inside her.<br /><br />By and large, A Game of Thrones is one of the best books I've read since finishing Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon many, many years ago. It is a book I will read over and again for the rest of my life, just for the pleasure of revisiting old friends and living through their adventures with them again.<br /><br />Five out of Five Stars without hesitation.

B004NSULHM|4.0|I mean, they've done it all, haven't they? They've reached the pinnacle of their sounds, they've experimented with seeing how far their techniques can go, and here they are, this is where they ended up. It's totally understandable, really. Falling back to their original sounds, or, in other words, just playing out something more prototypically rock music would mean exactly that, falling back, and they just can't do that, eh? They can't go back to \\"The Bends\\" for example, they can't go back to \\"OK Computer\\" in between the two CDs where they found themselves, where they found their style, their mark. Nah, they can't do that. They have to keep pushing the experiments further and further as much as they can until the mutation can mutate no more, and it's an obvious progression to end up here. Know what I mean?
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is an awesome awesome album. Adele's voice is so beautiful and the songs are so different from each other. For the last month I have played this cd on repeat in my truck without getting bored.
0393338827|5.0|It's very rare that a book can simultaneously make complex subjects readable while at the same time giving you more than just a superficial understanding of the material. I learned more from this book than from an entire college semester, and in a much more entertaining fashion.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|This movie is bad.  Bad casting, bad acting, bad script, and bad direction.  Even the special effects are bad!  If you are a fan of movies like Sahara, National Treasure, and Prince of Persia then this movie is for you.  Otherwise, stay far away from this uninspired, dull, soulless remake.  Apart from the obvious flaws you notice immediately into the film, the most disappointing is that this movie takes away all the charm the original Clash of the Titans had.  A perfect example is Bubo, the mechanical owl who helps Perseus in the first film.  He served as a R2D2 type character providing comic relief as well as being a guide for the hero.  In this movie, Perseus notices Bubo on a pile of junk and picks him up and asks \\"What is this?\\". In response, he is told to \\"leave THAT behind\\".  He is then tossed back onto the pile of junk with a shrug.  Enough said.

B003Y7L5W8|5.0|Wow. Where did this come from? I thought OMD was just another has-been, early eighties, New Wave, New Romantic, Roxy Music clone with a couple of nice tunes from way back when. Then I check this album out from mere curiosity that such a band still even exists, and what do I find but a pop masterpiece that is fully up to the level of the greats of its genre (which is somewhere between Roxy and the equally great Giorgio Moroder).     Indeed, this record surpasses its influences in at least one way - the lyrics on this album have remarkable depth for mere techno-pop. The lyrics even seem to be offending some materialist types on this board, which to my mind is a ringing endorsement. But don't even worry about the lyrics, get this one for the sound: still early eighties techno-pop, but with modern production and superb vocals. There are a few tunes on the last half that are too much like contemporary dance tracks, but then again a little variety never hurt and these days it is easy enough to delete tracks not to your taste, and this album has enough great tunes to more than make up for the duds. In fact, I think this is probably a better song collection than this band's greatest hits package. Whoever would have thought?
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I do have qualms with the storyline of this film. Tiana was already a hard-working, well-rounded character with her head in the right place and a focus perfectly acceptable for her time and even moreso in our time. Yet she, according to her friends, her mother, and the wise ol' witch in the Bayou, had to stop reaching for her dream just to dally in the matters of love?? There's plenty of time for that afterward, not before, and anyone with an ounce of sense on the subject will know that when it comes to a career, love simply has to fall on the back-burner, at least for a little while. And of all the people for such a strong, driven woman fall in love with, why did it have to be such a selfish, pennyless, egotistical character like Naveen? He has nothing to offer her, lied to her, could not even protect her, and enjoys flirting with other women. Of course he'd fall in love with HER, she has everything to offer him. But her, for him? Doesn't make sense, Disney. Just doesn't make sense...<br /><br />In lieu of that, this movie is excellent. I am a big fan of 2D animation, and The Princess and the Frog was a welcome sight after years of stagnancy in the pool of this apparently long-lost art. The animation itself is spot on, and I am a big fan of frogs myself. The musical numbers in this movie were also quite excellent, and I was delighted during the Friends on the Other Side scene with all the brilliant voodoo color and feel. Also, the Evangeline song scene was beautiful and enchanting, and held up splendidly to all the other classic Disney love scenes.<br /><br />Definitely worth the watch, worth the buy, and worth promoting!

B004SBX112|2.0|I got this during the free day but didn't have the chance to play it until now.  Honestly, it starts out way too difficult from the start. Having the first few levels almost completely filled with heavy pillars you can't break through and requiring perfect aim from the start is just plain silly and killed the potential fun in this installment of the series.  The other games aren't like this, I don't know why this one is.
B004MC0FO8|1.0|Perhaps this version is not designed for a wi-fi only device? I am having no luck getting setup to complete on the Xoom wi-fi. Installs fine. And that is as far as it goes.

B003UESJHY|5.0|This movie is one that any boxer fan should see and a movie that any boxer or boxer trainer absolutely must see. Although I am a professional boxer trainer, I must mention that this movie isn't a movie just for boxing fans. Anyone who enjoys a good story of someone who struggled against the odds and still succeeded will enjoy this movie.  In a sense, this is also a family film because it demonstrates the importance of family values and what it means to never put anything such as your profession or dreams before your family, and that you don't have to comprise family in order to accomplish your goals.

The only negative about this album is that some songs are pointless, the first 6 are OK, but the last few tracks...well, not the best. Over all, a MUST HAVE FOR A TRUE OZZY FAN!!!

B00009R86L|5.0|This will be straight forwarded, we're not discussing a complex electronic gadget here, just a shoulder pad. Still, I do find it quite beneficial for the purpose intended, I'm glad I ordered it. My Domke camera bag, thanks to the \\"L\\" lenses, is quite heavy. I do find this pad excellent in preventing the shoulder strap from digging in when walking any distance at all. It's still quite new, so I can't comment on the longevity factor, but so far/so good.
0061733199|4.0|Excellent book, complete with pics of plants, animals on glossy pages. Very exhaustive list. The only thing I'd say negative or if I could suggest an improvement to the publisher is in the BINDING. If it was in spiral or comb, it would be a lot easier to keep the book flat open while you follow the instructions. This book is HARD to open flat, a bit of an inconvenience but it shouldn't stop you from buying it, if at least you err on the side of caution, as I do because of hurricanes here on the east coast.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I have always been a fan of Alternative Media Sources and smaller movie productions. Mainstream Media and Hollywood offer much needed services for the world; however, it's still refreshing to get the \\"Little Guys\\" opinion every once in a while, if for no other reason to ensure we gain a COMPLETE picture of our surroundings. First thing is first, THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES. Instead, this movie outlines that while bigger companies grow in size and develop ways to feed LARGE amounts of the population at a RESONABLE price point, that inevitably compromises must be made. Unfortunately, as you watch this movie you are made aware of how drastic these Compromises are, and how they affect the Quality and Nutrition of our food supply. It also adds that every time you choose to buy food that is produced for the `MASSES\\", that you are in essence \\"casting your vote of approval\\". Conversely, if we choose to buy from local farms and natural/organic food processing plants, we will encourage this behavior. If enough of us make this choice, one day the Big Companies will see a chance to make money and will start investing into more appropriate food practices. Another disturbing fact the movie points out is \\"the average distance food travels before it gets to our grocery stores\\". With the average distance ranging from 1200-1600 miles, that made me wonder what would happen if there were a few \\"Temporary\\" disruptions in this food chain. For example, bad weather, high gas prices, trucker strikes, terrorist attacks, ect. It just seems to me that if we continue to rely on the Inefficient System that these Big Food processors use to feed us, we are setting ourselves up for failure. I would rather spend MORE MONEY NOW and ensure a healthier existence than spend MORE MONEY LATER for medications and hospitals bills from the poor quality of food that I ate while I was young!
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|I know I'm not the first to make this observation, but the film deviates quite a lot from Alan Moore's original graphic novel. Being a fan of the original, I found the film lacking on first viewing. After recently watching it again I found the film to be better the second time. For me, I had to learn to accept the film as a stand-alone piece, and in and of itself it is not bad. I didn't really care for Natalie Portman's accent, and her acting seemed really stiff at times, but the film looks beautiful and is enjoyable enough for its own merits.
B000UR9T82|5.0|Tengo este juego de peliculas en DVD, pero me animé por esta Trilogía en Blu Ray y es otra cosa, la nitidez visual y calidad de sonido son espectaculares, el servicio de Amazon muy bueno, rápido y confiable.
1564029654|5.0|ISBN 1564029654 [[ASIN:1564029654 Owl Babies]] - Printed in Mexico (because, as I'm learning, almost nothing seems to get printed in America!). Age range not stated. I love board books and I can't really tell you why, other than that they appeal to that part of me that wants the whole world to read, even babies!<br /><br />Three baby owls wake up one night, in the hole in the trunk of a tree that is their home, to find their mother is gone. After much fretting and thinking, the trio heads outside to wait and eventually huddles together, worried and wishing. Suddenly their wish is granted, when their mother returns and reminds them that they KNEW she'd be back.<br /><br />Adorable little Bill's constant refrain of \\"I want my mommy!\\" tips this tale from cute to heartbreaking. Martin Waddell's text is superb and the illustrations, by Patrick Benson, are night-time dark without being particularly scary. The baby owls could not possibly be more precious, with their huge eyes and the surprising expressions on their faces. A fantastic story that will comfort most children with the notion that mothers always come back. The board book pages are thick enough to make handling them easy for small fingers and unlikely to bend or tear with any ease. The fact that they're glossy makes them wipe clean easily, too.<br /><br />It's possible that the tone you use when you read this book might upset a child. If you convey that you find it scary, or that it should be scary, you're going to scare a child. It's not hard to do that when the images are as dark as these and Mom is missing. All it takes is a little effort to turn \\"Mom is missing!\\" to \\"where is she?\\", making a horror into a kind of peek-a-boo. If you can't do that, don't buy this book.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks
B003LXSY60|5.0|This LP could be the most influential album of the 21st century.  The soundscapes and melodies are almost beyond comprehension.  This album is perfect.  No, it is not pure adrenaline... but you probably already own that Black Keys album already.  This is Led Zepplin 2011.  I can't wait for the next installment.
B004LFO0ME|2.0|Khalifa is one of my favorite MCs but this album is trash. It really speaks volumes that the mixtape he just dropped (cabin fever) is better than this bowel movement Atlantic Records forced him to push out. They tried to ruin Lupe's Lasers but it was still a dope LP. However this album is turrible (charles barkely voice). Pretty bad when the rapper is singing on the majority of the album. All of you Wiz followers who jumped on board after hearing black and yellow Im sure you will love this album but this is not Wiz. Taylor Gang or buy this album.......Shizs Weak!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Same great game we've been enjoying for years.  For some reason, there are two paid versions with different pricepoints on Android.  There is only one single version for iPhones that supports both retina display and non-retina display resolutions.  It would be great if the THD version is combined with the regular version so we don't have to re-purchase the same game just because we switched phones.
B000N3ST7K|1.0|Not all of the titles on this CD are surf music titles. BEWARE. This is a soundtrack to a movie (where it should be properly listed) This is not a 100% surf disk.
B004GYY714|2.0|*Update* 3/17/2012: The quality of this app has taken a nose dive, the developers have added Twitter and Facebook popups that cannot be turned off; they have made a shake to shuffle type feature that asks you if you want to turn it on whenever the phone shakes, to me that is idiotic, after all I disabled it for a reason, if I wanted it on I would turn it on; they have now made it so stations auto-select the fastest stream available, this usually also means the lowest quality stream available (i.e. one station I like would select a 32k mono and would not allow me to select the 128k stereo stream I know to be available). And finally the load and drop rate has taken a severe hit, popular stations seem to take a very long time to load and lose the stream at the slightest hiccup.<br /><br />This app is amazing... first off the sheer fact that it provides a fast and easy way to listen to radio stations broadcasting over the internet using your Android phone is nice, but aside from giving you thousands of options on radio stations keep in mind you can get live sports casts you normally would not be able to catch because you cant be tied to a TV or computer at the time, you can get radio drama or audio book readings, new from you favorite news radio, etc...<br /><br />Another awesome feature is also the radiotime.com website, TuneIn radio is a really an interface of sorts for using that site from devices like phones, DVD/BR players with web apps, TV widgets, etc... what this means for you? Well if your like me and you have more than one device that has TuneIN radio than you can create a profile on radiotime.com, than use your login from the site in the android app or other device app and it will automatically import all stations from your presets that are supported by that device.<br /><br />For me personally the best part of the app is being able to listen to two of my favorite stations from back home while working and driving... Sfera 102,2 and Rythmos 94,9 from Greece.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|If you just need to kill a few minutes, this game is the way to go. Simple, elegant, and fun. The achievements aren't that hard to get, but the gameplay is killer.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|There's only so much you can fit in a movie, so the details only get so deep.  But the movie is an excellent overview of the things that have gone wrong with our financial system in the last few decades leading to the current disaster.  Be aware that some of the people being interviewed as \\"good guys\\" also have had a hand in some of the problems (Barney Frank).  I guess maybe it's hard to know a lot of the details and be 100% clean...

B004FN7ZOC|5.0|While some may call Among Amarth \\"repetitive\\", I for one am a big fan of \\"Different, yet consistent\\".      Amon Amarth personify this ethos with every release.  They know what works and they stick to it.  In a world obsessed with ever-changing themes and styles, I'm very thankful for bands like Among Amarth.  I know for certain when I pick up one of their albums that it will be different enough to warrant purchase yet consistent with what I love about the band.  So few are left with this mentality. Most metal heads I meet today want a \\"super-band\\" that will change style and form with every release and make every song require national orchestras to sound \\"different\\".  With Amon Amarth, that just isn't necessary.    Surtur Rising will not disappoint you.  Every track has a purpose and, in typical Amon Amarth fashion, tells a story all on their own, lending to a greater tale throughout the album experience.  Johan's vocals are the best they've ever been with this release.  The musicianship is so tight and believable you'll feel like you're at a concert hall banging your head to every track.  It's albums like these that make people want to invest in expensive car/home stereo systems!    Buy this right now!  You'll be doing yourself a disservice if you pass up on what will surely be one of the best albums of the year!
B004GYY714|5.0|I use this everyday at work to listen to my favorite morning talk radio show, Bob and Tom. I haven't had any problems with it.
1597801585|5.0|I finished this book a few weeks ago, and am still thinking about it. Very dystopian but I love that stuff. So many people seem to have had a hard time getting through it. I read a lot but haven't reviewed a book here before. But this one stuck with me so much that I put it on par with some of the other greats, Neal Stephenson comes to mind, detailed but worth it in the end, a great SF novel!!!
B001EN71HC|3.0|I bought this box set and have watched it on both my 50 inch and 40 inch screens and there is still a grainy appearance on both. I enjoy the movies very much and am a huge fan of Mike Myers so I was quick to snatch this up. Less than $30 for all 3 films was great and the colors are vibrant and sound is excellent just a little grain on facial close-ups.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|If you can unlock everything in an hour or so that's bad, but this game is still a good game. The last update for the Android Market version added Arcade Mode. That's pretty big for buck game. So don't miss out on it being free. No pages on Samsung Fascinate with 1ghz processor
B004G6009U|5.0|I was worried about Tangled after the disaster that was The Princess and the Frog, but I was glad my worry was unnecessary. Tangled is such a sweet, funny movie, like Aladdin and The Little Mermaid before it. A few of my favorite characters/scenes/whatever:<br /><br />1) The voices were perfectly cast, especially Rapunzel and Flynn Rider. Plus, the actors (Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi) actually sang the songs!<br />2) The lantern/love song scene is one of the sweetest scenes in Disney movie history.<br />3) Maximus, the horse, is hilarious. My son loves the scene where Rapunzel soothes him.<br />4) The song by Grace Potter that plays during the end credits...love it!
B002XTBEDI|5.0|EXCELLENT PERIOD PIECE - I watch many, many period piece movies and series. I see excellent costumes true to their period. Also, I look for furniture, decoration on room walls, outside grounds, clarity of voice and brightness of coloring, not just how the characters play their parts. I only give 5 stars when a movie or series passes all the tests, and I feel this one deserves a 5. I do wish this series was longer though.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|I like this album. It's very different from Brit's work in the past and has a lot of leading edge grooves in it.  I believe she put herself into this album and is trying to reach another level. Some of the songs are very different for her especially Don't keep me waiting, Seal it with a kiss and Up N' Down. Uplifting music, worth the buy.

B000089Q9D|1.0|I am very disappointed because there are completely missing segments throughout the film and the ending when the principal character meets his former love is missing.  In addition, I was not aware your were sending me a copy of \\"dubbed in English\\" which is terrible.  I expected English sub titles which is the only way I have viewed this film.

3836501899|5.0|Honestly, at first this looked like something you could place on a coffee table or a dining room table, then forget about it having guests take 5 minute glances at it every now and again. What I didn't realize is how well the pictures are laid out in the book, the quality of the print, and the overall pristine wonder of the photographs inside. It still isn't really something you'd read over and over again, but if you want to be inspired, love classic photography, or maybe want a quick lesson on beginning to use polaroid photography, I'd definitely recommend this product. And let me tell you... for the price, this is easily one of the best deals on Amazon... 10 dollars for a 350 page book filled with a short history on the subject of polaroid photography, and hundreds of stunningly beautiful photographs, I can't describe how glad I am I made this purchase.
B004LFO0ME|5.0|ok to start off this guy has been in the rap game for a while now and no one has recognized him till black and yellow came out sooo please stop hating on this man.

B003Y5H50Q|5.0|Mostly, films go in one side of my head and right out the other.  If I can remember a film I saw Friday, on Monday, that's unusual.    It's been a couple weeks since I saw this.  It's still there in my memory.    I think there are several reasons, not necessarily in order of importance:    1) The opening credits are worth the price of admission on their own.  Whatever you were thinking when you sat down in the theater, you're transported immediately to somewhere else... wherever that will turn out to be.  Amazing and outstanding!    2) The overall plot is Hitchcock-esque.  You don't know what's going to happen, and cliches are out the window.  As the story builds, the suspense is palpable.    3) The visuals... This isn't on the scale of an AVATAR, but parts of it approach The Matrix.  This movie is really a trip-and-a-half.    4) The performances, and dramatic direction, are excellent, as are many other production factors, including music, that don't smack you in the face but which are indispensible to the experience.    5) The ending is entirely non-cliche and unpredictable.  Hitchcock would be proud to have directed it.    So, although it isn't populated with super-star actors and actresses (yet), this is a blockbuster, destined for cult fame and longevity.    The more I think about it, the more I like it.

014144116X|5.0|Along with the Raj Quartet, A Passage to India tells you everything you would ever want to know about life in India under the British Empire -- both from the points of view of the Brits and the Indians - and it tells you all about it in the context of extraordinary human experiences and traumas.  The point might be that you need not be interested in --  or even heard about -questions of the Empire or whatever: this is an extraordinary page turning drama.   No wonder A Passage to India still sells year in, year out, today --- 87 years after it was first published.  Robert Bottome  Caracas, Venezuela
030745455X|5.0|This book, though second hand, appeared to be brand new.  After having read the other two books by Stieg Larsson, I knew I would enjoy this one as much as those.  It lived up to his wonderful writing habits, from beautiful description to well defined characters.  As I have frequently done before, I purchased this book from Amazon.  I find them to be reliable and very helpful with letting the purchaser know what is happening to the ordered product.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|The more recent updates provide yet another form of this simple game, which I thought I could finally put down. The game looks deceptively easy. It's not. But I love it. Works flawlessly on my stock EVO.
B004I11VZ0|4.0|This movie is awesome! So much action pack and not to mention bruce lee at the end coming for training. Poor Sammo Hung.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|Ok, I love ballet, I love movies but can someone tell me what the hell this was? If I wasn't cringing I was staring in absolute horror.  Do yourself a favor and spend the money on any version of Swan Lake that Amazon offers or spend it on any Hitchcock movie. This  was strictly low rent.
B004222UCS|4.0|I bought this album on vinyl when it first came out and have always liked it, though it is pretty short (only about 35 minutes or so).  It's a Tony Iommi solo album that the record company stupidly insisted on releasing as a Sabbath album.  Forget the name on the cover.  It's a VERY GOOD Iommi solo album, with great hard rock songs and a killer vocal performance by Glenn Hughes.  On this deluxe edition, the bonus track on the first CD is the alternate mix of \\"No Stranger To Love\\" that was released as a single--it has more keyboards and was probably intended to be more 'radio-friendly'.  Not a major inclusion, but nice to have.      It would have been nice to have some demos with a few of the other singers that were tried before Glenn Hughes was brought in, including the infamous Jeff Fenholt.  Maybe Iommi doesn't feel comfortable sharing that material or no longer has access to it.    The second disc in the deluxe edition is really why I'm writing this review.  It's a live recording from the very last gig of the Seventh Star tour in London in 1986, several months after Ray Gillen had replaced Glenn Hughes on vocals.  The performance is good but the sound isn't so great.  I don't mind so much, since it's nice to have this recording available.  However, the record label should have sought out an excellent recording that exists of an earlier gig in San Antonio, Texas featuring the same lineup.  I have it on cassette somewhere, and the sound quality (it was a radio broadcast) is fantastic.  Plus, it's a longer show.      Oh well, at least we have this release.
B0019GJ4EC|5.0|The blu ray was awesome! I noticed details I've never noticed in the countless times I've watched on DVD, VHS, or Tv. The Picture and sound quality were great. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of John Carpenter or Jamie Lee Curtis. It is definately one of the best Horror movies of the 80's. My only Complaint there doesn't seem to be any special features, but you can usually find that stuff on youtube so it's all good. Check it out! Great film to watch on All Hallows Eve!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is a must see!  To even find out that Greenspan was a team member in this ponzi scheme is mind blowing.  These financial, economy and banking politician folks, some of whom are still in this present administration, should all be arrested.  And to know that Harvard Univ. and other prestigious universities have paid professors to write books and teach classes that support ripping us citizens of all our money through deregulations.  This is a MUST SEE!    Buy it right now and you'll immediately understand the scheme that was set up for our hard-earned tax dollars to end up bailing out Wall Street and how they constructed that mortgage scam that has people now living on the street while their pockets are filled with millions/billions/trillions.  Don't delay - Buy this DVD today.  You'll better understand what is happening with your money, lack of jobs, credit card rate increases and much more. Somebody had to be the victim of this ponzi scheme and low and behold it was you and me!  Wow!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This is a great mobile game and you know why? Cause it's not some long drawn out adventure full of missions and new levels and increasingly challenging gameplay. (Do not misunderstand, I LOVE video games and play them ALOT!) As a MOBILE game though, this is easy to pick up, play for 30 seconds or 5 minutes while you're waiting at the DMV or anywhere! The controls are EXCELLENT and the design makes it very pleasing to the eyes! The inclusion of Open Feint and In-Game \\"Achievements\\" double the fun as you try to unlock all the prizes while competing with your friend's scores.  You can't go wrong with Fruit Ninja! It's original and the BEST fruit slicing mobile game on any market!
B001AQT0ZO|5.0|I already owned an excellent edition of this movie on DVD (after upgrading to THAT from an older DVD release), but I recently got a Blu-Ray player, and thought the sumptuous visuals of this film would, if Blu-ray was as awesome as it's supposed to be, look REALLY awesome.<br /><br />It IS awesome. And the sound sounds better to me. If you are already familiar with this film and know you like it, it is worth the upgrade. If you haven't seen it but you liked, say, 'Moulin Rouge', it is worth the purchase.<br /><br />Heck, if you're just looking for something to show off what your Blu-ray can do, it's worth the purchase. Price was very reasonable and shipping was fast!

B000002JNJ|5.0|This album easily earns five stars. Dime was completely awesome and this album really shows what he was capable of. Vinnie's drumming is flawless.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|As of fan of Britney Spears since her first hit, \\"Baby One More Time\\", I had no doubt her 7th album would be just as her six prior albums: GREAT!!!<br />Femme Fatale is fun and sexy--- a mash-up of her most dance-y albums: Blackout and In the Zone.<br />I love every single song with the exception of the first single off the album: \\"Hold It Against Me\\" (it unfortunately just didn't grow on me).<br />Stand-out tracks are: \\"Till the World Ends\\", \\"Up n' Down\\", \\"Big Fat Bass\\", \\"Gasoline\\", \\"Trip to Your Heart\\", \\"He About to Lose Me\\", \\"Selfish\\", \\"Trouble for Me\\", \\"(Drop Dead) Beautiful\\", and \\"I Wanna Go.\\"<br />Femme Fatale as expected, pretty, very--- FANTASTIC!!!
B000001EL7|4.0|KISS - LOVE GUN : (4.5/5) Not quite Alive! or Destroyer caliber, but right there with Rock And Roll Over among Kiss' elite albums.    1) I Stole Your Love : (4/5) Hard-hitting Paul Stanley number that takes no prisoners. Only way to begin a Kiss album.  One flaw - seems like the rhythm guitar gets mixed too low toward the end.    2) Christine Sixteen : (4.5/5) Watered down with piano, but makes for a silky smooth Gene Simmons tune.  Nice punch to the drums on this one.  This song sticks with you.    3) Got Love For Sale : (3/5) Nice rambling tune but hardly ever climaxes.  Gene goes back to semi-growling for this one.  I actually prefer his singing voice.    4) Shock Me : (5/5) Hello, Ace!  Where have you been hiding?  Great tune that rocks hard with fairly unconventional chord progressions.  Ace lead vocal w/Gene & Paul backing vocals.  I like it!    5) Tomorrow And Tonight : (4/5) Some say it is a Rock & Roll All Nite remake.  Maybe, but it works for me.  The infectious chorus makes up for the campyness.  Dissing the teacher, the preacher, and the boss... 70's all the way.  Just have fun and rock out!    6) Love Gun : (4/5) Paul Stanley tune with sparse chords and a punch line.  Somehow the chorus works, although hard to explain why - Paul's yelling in the forefront with some \\"oo-la-la\\" backing vocals just seems to keep your fist pumping.    7) Hooligan : (3.5/5) Peter Criss takes the mike for an average song with some cool lines.  A+ for the lyrics, but the music never really closes the deal.    8) Almost Human : (2.5/5) Gene does Gene.  Complete with smoke belch at the beginning.  Strong bass guitar in this song, but not much to wrap your head around once it's over.    9) Plaster Caster : (4/5) More smooth Gene vocals and a nice tune.  Catchy chorus once again, and you find yourself singing with Gene as the song fades.... PLASTER... CASTER!!!  She wants my love to last her.. And she calls me by the name of master!!!  Oh yeah.    10) Then She Kissed Me : (1/5) Not so good this time.  Not a complete disaster, but a poor decision to cover this tune.  This song was about a \\"he\\" originally.  Dang, do a Beatles or Stones cover or something...  No matter, the precedings of this fine offering overshadow the ending ditty.

B004RUF9DC|4.0|[[ASIN:B004RUF9DC The Greatest Story Ever Told [Blu-ray]]]I didn't especially care for the choice of master used on the previous DVD release of this film.  It made the overall mood extremely dark, and it definitely looked it.  At the beginning, the BD producers tell us that the best possible available film elements were used for the transfer to BD.  There were some occasional scratches and noise near the beginning, but not enough to be overly distracting.  The transfer to BD is an improvement over the previous DVD release.  Sound is quite good, overall.  Alfred Newman's chamber-like score comes across well, interspersed with the Handel \\"Messiah\\" Hallelujah Chorus and the opening movement of Verdi's Requiem on the Way to the Cross.  Some classical music aficionados felt that the addition of the excerpts from these masterworks detracted from the picture, as well as misrepresented the works as they should be heard, but I didn't really feel that way.    Compared to many BD releases of classic films, the extras contained within this BD release are minimal, and considering that the film running time was 3 hrs. and 19 minutes, the producers likely had to literally squeeze these as a small window near the upper left corner of the screen to save disk space, making these difficult to see (with the exception of the trailer).  Before I forget to mention it, I found it difficult to access the main menu for this disk on my HD TV's BD player and ended up having to view the extras using the BD drive and viewing software on my computer.  Hopefully, most of you won't have this problem.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|considering the junk for Android games, this is a well made game with original music and great graphics.  Downside is that there are only a few modes, and the game is just a time sender, no adventure or anything
0767817478|5.0|its perfect. I love it. i was looking for this movie on ebay and all other webside but amazon gave me good deal and there was not hidden words or story i got what i was looking for and i received which i read and saw.  so thank you Amazon i love it.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This is a better game than I expected it to be. I mean, after all, you are just swiping your finger across the screen, right? This game proves the old axiom that simple is often better. You simply have to slash the fruit and avoid the bombs. The touchscreen responsiveness is accurate, the action is fast and furious, and the graphics are very good on my G2. While this may not be a game to keep you occupied for hours on end and months from now, for a quick time waster this is more than worth $.99....and if you are seeing this as the app of the day it becomes a no brainer. It doesn't even ask for invasive permissions like a lot of apps.<br /><br />BTW, to the posters who are complaining that this game runs slow on their device...sorry, but your device isn't the speed demon you thought it was or would like it to be. Droid X users especially...check a benchmark or two: just because you have a big screen doesn't mean what's inside is worth a crap. That phone is known to have a slow processor and a VERY weak graphics chip. My G2 can't compete with the Galaxy S phones in gaming but it more than handles this with ease. In other words...upgrade your phone, it's not the game's fault!
B004KSQN7C|4.0|No doubt this is the best Britney's album. She is on line with dance needs of world music. But this is a producers job, she just put her \\"voice\\" in the studio. She needs more creative control in production and lyrics, she's amazing songwriter so i don't understand why she don't have one of her songs here.
0756405890|3.0|Realistically, the book is more like a 3.5 to 3.7 for me but since Amazon doesn't allow that I'll err on the side of caution. While this is easily a very creative and very enjoyable book, there are a few things that kept me from really loving it.    Rothfuss' writing is fantastic, with dialogue that sounds natural and believable rather than suffering from the stiff, overly dramatic prose most other fantasy novels are plagued with. If he has a problem, it's a tendency to lapse too far and too often into a \\"story within a story\\", devoting pages and pages at length to characters recounting myths and legends and songs in painstaking detail to the point where I really just wanted to skim past it all.    But for me, the worst part of the book is actually Kvothe himself, who comes across as far too preternaturally talented at anything and everything and far too universally adored/admired to really be that likable. Any characters who dislike him are cartoonishly overdone into scheming, foot-stomping villains who are just jealous of Kvothe's abilities. Your mileage may vary, but for me it got to a point where it was reading a bit too much like someone's favourite \\"Mary Stu\\" character; fantasy wish fulfillment. Kvothe needed to fail a bit more, to have people who WEREN'T just cardboard cutouts dislike him, for me to really care about him and stop rolling my eyes every time someone else popped up and started breathlessly recounting his heroics or the narrative started describing him again in somber, mythic tones. Childhood tragedy, no matter how big, is not enough to automatically endear a character to me.    The Name of the Wind is definitely one of the best fantasy books to come out in a long time, and you should certainly give it a look if you're bored with the dinosaurs of the genre and looking for something that reads like it was written within the last century. It's fun and engaging, and there's no guarantee you'll share my problems with it. Despite its lack of a believable hero, there's enough fantasy here to keep things feeling mysterious and threatening, without overdosing on dragons, wizards, and elves who fart rainbows.
B001NB8KAM|5.0|The righteously rebellious youths of the mid eighties graduated here. Their anthems were handed down to us, the next generation, with authority to point out the mistakes of our parents and teachers without totally alienating ourselves, or giving up hope for a better future. Though Joshua Tree was breaking records by the time I reached high school, it is the lyrics from War that motivated us to get involved.<br /><br />This edition has a second disc with remastered remixes that proves that War is still relevant today. This is a must have album for anyone who remembers anything positive about the eighties. The social causes of today were just becoming apparent to us. We were interested because of songs like these.
0399250573|3.0|I absolutely loved the Alex Rider series in all, but the last book was a bit disappointing for me. First, the suspense building up to it was good. Who was going to get shot? Jack, Sabina, maybe even someone from M16. I was very excited and could not wait to get the book. But when I finished it, I was disappointed. I had expected more action than there was and for it to keep me on the edge of my seat the whole time. It did not do that. There are many different opinions for this book, but I did not like it. Crocodile Tears was definitely my favorite.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|Party, backyard bbq, boat ride, drive in the desert - this is the music to listen to. Jesse Cook is a talented and gifted musician. A great gift for just about anyone who likes great music.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I bought the music cd as a birthday gift to my wife for my daughter. My wife says it was the correct Doo-Wops & Hooligans disc so I did something right. The price was excellent so everything and everybody are happy.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I looked for years for the color version of this movie for my mom. I was so excited to find this one that comes with the b&w and color versions. Great picture quality
B004GBIE3Y|2.0|Slow paced and dragging this story could have been told in a better way. Even those with mental illness are not so lackluster. I was grateful for fast forward.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I don't think this is an improvement over the original. In fact, I kinda miss the pigs. As for the game play, it's smooth as usual. Graphics are great. Sound effects are great. I also miss the original theme song. Maybe I'm just being nostalgic, but I rate this game as just OK.
B001UV4XWY|3.0|This film had some real potential. It has some very interesting visual effects and a strong cast. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz do a credible job of playing Norma and Arthur Lewis and the supporting cast, such as Norma's old south mother, is excellent. Frank Langella is also wonderful as the mysterious man with the box. Yet the film misses the mark and leaves viewers disappointed. The plot initially seems simple and may be a morality tale about human being's value systems and altruism, but the science fiction got in the way of a coherent final product. In the end, the viewer asks: What did the US government have to do with this alien's plans for humanity? Why were humans transported to some distant reality through a hotel pool? Why were the scenes looking up references in the library included? Why did the baby sitter have a victim map on her motel bedroom wall? Why did the box man not fulfill his end of the bargain? There were too many lose ends. There was one coherent philosophical thread that made some sense. Norma asks the box man if there is no forgiveness, and though he shows compassion, the chain of events has begun and the implication is that in this deterministic world that the chain of events must unfold even if weak humans wish to repent of their past actions and decisions. Thus eventually, she must make the existential decision that is the payment for her earlier actions and decisions. Too bad that this theme was not explored more fully even if the discussion between the box man and Norma in the library was very interesting and the final scenes between Norma and Arthur are extremely dramatic. The film had some potential but the lose-ends and unresolved rabbit trails ended up frustrating many viewers.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|We all know what Shazam does, and it does it well. It even recognizes songs in French, Spanish, Russian, it's pretty cool. However, they do a terrible job managing memory and the app quickly bloats to 6+ megabytes, which is pretty huge and they don't allow the \\"Move to SD\\" option. What's up with that Shazam? Otherwise works great.
B004GYY714|5.0|sweet!  gets stations my antenna can't touch.  Just plug my phone in car systenand boot up this app! Everything comes in clear/crisp.<br /> must have app.
B004O88LPA|5.0|So incredibly awesome. For readers of Discworld: it mashes several stories together all in one go, which does end up being a bit confusing, but at the same time somehow it follows a continuous, fairly stable plot thread. Perfect little moments of memorable dialogue, and PERFECT selection of characters. Was a little disappointed that the Patrician came off so moustache-stroking, but finding a perfect Patrician is no doubt nigh-on impossible. Rincewind was BRILLIANT and Twoflower was amazingly cheek-pinchingly ADORABLE. I never saw him as adorable in the books, but oh my is he, and oh how it works for him!<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with Discworld and Terry Prachett, this is a FABULOUS fantasy creation that pokes fun at the entire genre, the entire human race, politics, myth, and culture. If you've ever made fun of fantasy stocks-in-trades like the muscle-rippling hero, the pompous gray-bearded mages, magical artifacts, or perpetually unafraid heroes--this is for you.<br /><br />Even if you haven't, watch it anyway, and then realize that the movie is in truth nothing but a brief glimpse--a teaser, if you will--into the marvelous world of Terry Prachett, and go buy every last one of his books in a frenzy of glee.<br /><br />The sharp, almost underhanded wit utilized in the dialogue is only the beginning: imagine the entire world being narrated that way.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I originally started watching this show because I love Ashley Benson and was excited to see her working on another project. While that reason would keep me tuning in every week if nothing else did, that is hardly the case. There is suspense, romance, drama, and even some comedy. There were moments where you'd feel your eyes water or moments where you'd be stomping your feet in rage because you couldn't believe that character did that. This show is definitely a winner and I believe that if anyone, even if they weren't that interested, just sat down and watched a couple of episodes, they'd be hooked too. It's so good that I planned my school schedule so that it wouldn't conflict with the airings. Unlike other ABC Family shows, this is one that even adults could enjoy.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|My Track By Track Review Of Femme Fatale<br /><br />1. Til the World Ends - THIS SONG IS AMAZING. Ke$ha wrote this one and you can hear her style all over the song. Ke$ha is such a guilty pleasure, but I love her and I'm protective of her. When those bikini pics came out and I read everyone on the superficial making fun of Ke$ha, I got all sad.<br /><br />2. Hold it Against Me - THIS SONG IS AMAZING.This was the one that had that amazinggg video where it was all about Britney's career, but no one interpreteted it as that. They were like \\"Wait a second, Britney Spears crashed onto earth in a rocketship like Superman. Is Britney Spears Superman? I'm glad she only attacked a car with that umbrella if she was Superman because otherwise she would have definitely killed someone.\\" In the video, note the inspiration of McQueen S/S 99.<br /><br />3. Inside Out - THIS SONG IS AMAZING.  This song is almost like a companion to the greatest pop song of our generation \\"Cry Me a River\\" where JT was like \\"MEH you cheated on me Brit,\\" and now Britney is like, \\"Yeah, but you know you want to b.ng me at least one last time and I'm okay with you filming that lookalike and jumping on my countertops. I can get past that.\\" This song HAS to be the third single.<br /><br />4.I Wanna Go - THIS SONG IS AMAZING. This song is slutty and I love it. \\"Shame (accent on the e) on me (accent on the e) to need (accent on the ee) release (accent on the e)\\" is the first part and then it has a chorus like \\"I wa-anna g-go a-all the-e way-y\\" and I'm like Britney you stuttering b.tch, lets go all the way.<br /><br />5. How I Roll - THIS SONG IS AMAZING. This part has a hand clap intro but I was clapping like a full on Brandon Fraiser r3tard clap at this point in the album because I was so pleased so I didn't notice the clapping for a second. There is some bro on this song, not really sure who he is. He seems minor in the scheme of things but he doesn't b0ll0cks anything up so he can remain on the track. There isn't a ton of music going on in the background, it's just the claps, a piano and some sort of bubble machine. OH MAN if Britney makes a video with bubbles it will be perfect. Bubble video now. Thx.<br /><br />6.(Drop Dead) Beautiful feat. Gabi - THIS S0NG IS AMAZING. It contains my favorite lyric of the entire album, \\"Who Ever Said Beauty's on the Inside is a Liar\\". This song is perfect, except for this Gabi bitch. Dear Gabi, 1. Who the F are you and 2. GTFO<br /><br />7.Seal It With a Kiss - THIS SONG IS AMAZING. \\"OhohWEOH,\\" That's what I'm going to call out at ladies I want to kiss. If this song is any indication, it will work. The chorus to this song is so good I came. This should be the fourth single. They still do that right? Release four singles off an album? They released that entire Black Eyed Peas album as singles so Brit Mutha Effin' SP can get 4 singles.<br /><br />8.Big Fat Bass - THIS SONG IS AMAZING. Ugh. Will I. Am. He hadddd to be on this album, didn't he? Whatever, I guess the song turned out cool and he does have a monsterous legion of retards who love his every song so it will make people buy the album so I guess that's okay. A lot of this song is, SUPRISE robotic sounding. WTF is this bro Will I. Am a robot? Every time I see him he has plastic hair and his voice is all robotic and he's dancing the robot and at some point you just want to be like:  But, seriously, Will I. Am, you wack ass robot, you gave Britney a hit so forget that shopped pic I just put up. P.S. Thank you for warning me about the kick drum.<br /><br />9. Trouble For Me - THIS SONG IS AMAZING - The booklet lists FOUR people singing background vocals on this. 4 lucky b.tches if you ask me. This song is good, but not as good as Britney's \\"Trouble\\" song (which is my favorite britney song of all time shhh don't tell or the Toxic stans will drag me into the street and beat me with sticks and Sketcher shoes).<br /><br />10.Trip To Your Heart - THIS SONG IS AMAZING - This is one ofthose songs where it's 3 seconds in you're like, \\"Oh this will be my favorite song ever made, right now and the rest of the seconds are just bonus\\". Brit sounds a tad robotic on this, but who wouldn't love their very own robot Britney? I will gladly trade you my PS3 for a robot Britney. My PS3 streams ne3fl1x! I will even give you my password and you can watch episodes of Arrested Development for free and all you have to do is give me your Britney robot. My ps3 plays blu-rays. I will give you Eclipse special edition bluray (no chance you're getting my New Moon ultimate fan edition BluRay with collectable film cell) if you trade me your Britney robot.<br /><br />11.Gasoline - THIS SONG IS AMAZING - Britney's heart only runs on supreme so if your poor self couldn't afford the deluxe edition, bad news for you...<br /><br />12. Criminal - THIS SONG IS AMAZING - I was waiting for a slow song by Brit. I was getting worried. Is it \\"Everytime\\" level? No. \\"Everytime\\" is probably the most artistic of Brit's work. I'm not saying it's Beatles level, but that's mostly because the Beatles are overrated dude with bad haircuts so I wouldn't want to bring \\"Everytime\\" down like that. Towards the end of \\"Criminal\\" it sounds like someone has a recorder solo. Did you have one of those in elementary school? Everyone had to learn different songs on the recorder and play them, but I never got to learn anything bitchin' like Criminal. I hope that they change the curriculum to include Brit.<br /><br />12. Up N Down - THIS SONG IS AMAZING - I think this is when the bonus tracks start. If you're poor you don't have this song and you're missing out. But you're poor so you're probably used to missing out, tbh. At one point in the song, you could tell that Brit didn't want to say the, \\"not afraid to rush\\" part because she wanted to say, \\"not afraid to ffff\\". Listen to the song, you can hear Britney trying to hold in her ffff.<br /><br />13. He About To Lose Me - THIS SONG IS AMAZING - This is a slower Brit song as well, but it still has a danceable beat. If it wasn't a bonus track, it would have been great in the middle of the album to break up the hard dance tracks. That's me being album advice guy because I have so much musical expertise. Dear lady who has sold a trillion records, listen to this homeless looking guy sitting on his futon blogging, he knows what he's talking about. It kind of sounds like Britney isn't singing the chorus to this song. At least they didn't put stupid ass Gabi on this track.<br /><br />14. Selfish - THIS SONG IS AMAZING - This song has the lyrics \\"I'm a girl and you're a boy,\\" that's probably why it's a bonus track. The chorus of this song is great though. I wish, boom boom baby, Britney would pick me up in her Mercedes. Maybe that's me being a little selfish?<br /><br />15. Don't Keep Me Waiting - THIS SONG IS AMAZING - The name of this song is what I would yell at the TV every time Britney came on and it was a clip of her doing something besides working on Femme Fatale. I think that was probably the inspiration for this song, the ravings of a lonely madman. Not the greatest song in the world, but whatever, by the time this song comes on, I'll be dressed, full of at least 5 shots, my hair will straightened and I'll be ready for the night.<br /><br />So that's a rundown of the 15 best songs ever written.those songs where it's 3 seconds in you're like, \\"Oh this will be my favorite song ever made, right now and the rest of the seconds are just bonus\\".

0060853964|5.0|This is the only book where I've actually worn through copies. My Harry Potter and Discworld books get beat up, sure. But I've actually worn this out. That's just how good it is. I'm thinking it's time I get the hardcover, because I'm less likely to destroy it.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" -- this is as good as that, if not better. Like Hitchhiker's Guide, it's one of those books that tends to embed funny thoughts in your head that somehow surface in every day life. I have threatened my houseplants, and every time I'm stuck in traffic I wonder if there isn't demonic influence going on. I've read the classics, and perused the \\"books everyone should read\\" lists. But, in the end, Gatsby and Emma aren't nearly as awesome of a character as Crowley; and if you look past the humorous presentation, there is a lot of truth in what Gaiman and Pratchett wrote.

B000063DIR|1.0|Sadly, it is not common knowledge that Bob Daisley was the primary lyricist on Ozzy's first five albums--not too mention his musical input--because to reveal that would be destroying the manufactured image of Ozzy as the songwriter he never has been. Pure greed and devious machinations in the Osbourne camp perpetrated this atrocious maneuver, however to remove Bob Daisley's hand entirely from the two albums would have created the need to write entirely new songs, so he gets the last laugh in at least some way. Bordin and Trujillo should have been blacklisted from the industry for participating in such a crime.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I have read all the so called fixes to get this thing loaded onto my phone. None work and still am getting not enough space to install. You would think 34mb of free space would do it.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|Altho I'm not a fan of horror films in general, I have to give this one 5 stars for an interesting premise and excellent execution.  It's genuinely creepy, without all super-excessive blood and gore. Being a vampire flick, of course there is blood, but not enough to be a turn-off.  The only negative of the English-dubbed version is that some of the voice actors (minor roles only) don't really fit their roles. However, if you can forget the final scene of this film quickly, you weren't paying attention!
B004EPYZU8|5.0|\\"Sucker Punch\\" is gorgeous.  And I'm not just talking about its quintet of leading ladies, who are all undeniably attractive.  Every shot of the movie is absolutely drool-worthy.    It's no \\"Citizen Kane\\" or \\"Casablanca.\\"  But who expects it to be?  Anyone familiar with director Zack Snyder's previous films (the remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", \\"300\\", \\"Watchmen\\") or anyone who's seen a trailer of the movie, should know exactly what to expect.      It's hard to describe the plot because there's plenty open to interpretation.  The movie follows a girl, played by Emily Browning, known to the audience mostly as \\"Babydoll.\\"  Locked away in an insane asylum, she and/or the other girl(s) cope with reality by retreating into one or more levels of fantasy.  Now's not the place to get into my interpretation of the plot.  Suffice it to say the \\"story\\", while being a little bit deeper than what you'd expect from your typical action flick, is still just a line to hang jaw-dropping action scenes on.      As Snyder's first completely original screenplay, \\"Sucker Punch\\" is exactly what you would expect from the imagination of the man who directed \\"Watchmen\\".  Almost every male fantasy conceivable is brought to life on screen, from the beautiful women (obviously), to samurai swords, epic fantasy and science fiction landscapes, heavy artillery, evil robots, and more.  Snyder doesn't exactly have a flare for dialogue, and some of the lines feel clunky.  So, thankfully, not much talking is done.   The dramatic opening sequence, after a little bit of narration, is silent except for a cinematic cover of \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\\", telling the audience everything they need to know through action and the actor's expressions.  Similarly, not much talking gets done during the movie's big action set pieces, definitely the highlights of the film.    As with Snyder's other films, it's easy to compare the way certain scenes are shot to a video game or a music video.  The soundtrack is perfect, incorporating covers of classic and modern rock songs perfect for each scene they accompany, including some performed by Emily Browning herself in an enchanting, haunting voice.  Even the incidental music adds to the movie's excitement.      Being a movie with five major characters that's less than two hours long, not all of the characters feel fully developed.  Jena Malone as \\"Rocket\\" delivers the best acting performance, sharing most of the movie's dramatic scenes with Abbie Cornish as \\"Sweet Pea.\\"  Vanessa Hudgens as \\"Blondie\\" actually does surprisingly well during the action scenes, but her voice still seems too sweet for this kind of role, and she's not going to help audience forget she's a graduate of \\"High School Musical\\" anytime soon.  Emily Browning does a fine job with the leading role, conveying more through her big eyes and pouty lips than any of her lines.  Jamie Chung as \\"Amber\\", personally my favorite character, sadly gets very little screen time.  As far as supporting performances go, Carla Gugino delivers yet another solid acting job, Jon Hamm adds a touch of class, and Scott Glenn intrigues as the mysterious, homespun wisdom spurning \\"Wiseman.\\"  Oscar Isaac is noteworthy as a nasty who doesn't seem like a typical Hollywood villain but an all-too-real sleaze ball audiences should love to loathe.    But for the most part, dialogue and story aren't Zack Snyder's strong suits.  The CGI is breathtaking, the action choreography's plenty of fun, the girls all look great, and the cinematography is a feast for the eyes.  And not just during action scenes.  Each time the camera panned around the murky corners of the asylum, I found myself turning my head to try to see what was coming.  \\"Sucker Punch\\" may not be for everyone, but it delivers everything the marketing promises.  It's a visual feast with a script that, while not sensational, manages to be just good enough to stay out of the way.

B004BLJQOK|4.0|I am usually not a fan of vampire movies, but I really enjoyed Let Me In.  More than just a vampire movie, Let Me In explores many awkward adolescent moments and tribulations.  I was both horrified and moved by both Owen and Abby as their relationship emerged over the course of the movie.<br /><br />Dark and troubling, make no mistake: this is a horror film...yet oddly it contains some tender moments.  The casting was spot on in my opinion - the actors portraying Owen and Abby were downright creepy to watch.  They engrossed me and I vicariously watched as the plot unfolded.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes vampire tales or those who just want to watch a creepy, dark movie.
1439102724|3.0|Sing You Home by Jodi Picoult<br />Atria, 2011<br />466 pages<br />Fiction; Issues<br />3.5/5<br /><br />Source: GalleyGrab<br /><br />Summary: Zoe and Max have struggled with infertility problems for years but now Zoe is twenty-eight weeks pregnant and they feel like they're in the home stretch.  Until she goes into labor and delivers a stillborn son.  Still she has hope and three frozen embryos but Max is done.  He does not want to go through a sixth round and they divorce.<br />Zoe is devastated and seeks solace in a new friendship with Vanessa which turns to romance.  They get married in Massachusetts and then decide to use the remaining embryos to have a child.<br />Max meanwhile turned to his conservative brother and sister-in-law Reid and Liddy for a place to live while he relapses into alcoholism until a saving experience with Jesus. Consequently when Zoe needs his permission for the embryos, he's uncertain.  His pastor excitedly uses this opportunity to fan a big court case with media attention attacking gays and their destruction of the traditional family.<br /><br />Okay, I know that's a long summary but I feel like it all had to be said before I get in to my thoughts.  I usually love Jodi Picoult's novels so I was psyched to get an advance peek at her latest. I didn't know anything about it going in and when I skimmed the summary on goodreads, I read it wrong believing that Zoe ended up wanting a family with the teenage girl she was helping.  Luckily that is not the case!<br /><br />I really liked Zoe and Max but if I had to choose one of them, I'd pick Max despite him being a much more flawed person.  He's an alcoholic with several falls of the wagon over the course of the novel, he lusts after a married woman, and he's rather indecisive.  But I liked his conversion experience and his deepening understanding of God's character although I wish there had been more scripture than the few instances that refer to homosexuality. I also loved Liddy with whom Max interacts; she made me think of the actress Anna Camp who actually played a similar character on \\"True Blood.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile I did not like Vanessa.  I don't know why.  She was very good at her job as a guidance counselor and their courtship (while much too whirlwind for my taste-about five months from falling in love and marriage to the court case) was sweet. Maybe it was how she and Zoe were incapable of tolerance while demanding it from the pastor?<br /><br />I know I'm just a college student with a very different set of experiences from forty-year old Zoe and her struggle to get pregnant but I did not understand why she wouldn't adopt or later use Vanessa's eggs and find a sperm donor.  Why was it SO important to have a child with her DNA when the ending chapter demonstrated that family is not just about blood?  I've obviously never been in that position but I know that there are loads of children who would love to be adopted by such a loving person and I wish she had seriously considered that alternative, either with Max or with Vanessa.<br /><br />I was sad that Christians came off so poorly especially because NEWS FLASH not all Christians hate gay people nor are all Christians against gay marriage and gay rights.  Yet the only Christians shown in the book are very anti-gay.  Admittedly it is clear that this is a super conservative congregation when the pastor says that porn videos should be in kindergarten classrooms because that was the equivalent of the president's sex-ed program.  But there were no liberal or even moderate Christian voices.<br /><br />One last comment: apparently the finished copy comes with a CD because Zoe is a music therapist and that plays a big role in the story.  My e-copy did not come with any music so I cannot comment on that.<br /><br />SPOILERS from the LAST chapter: So Liddy and Reid got divorced? Or did Reid die? Cling more to the church while she moved away? Is no one Christian anymore? Because that makes me sad.<br/><br />Overall: The presentation of Christians really lowered the rating for this book but I think most Picoult fans will be satisfied.Picoult fans will be satisfied.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Secretariat is based on the true story of the Triple Crown winner who also broke records for the fastest run race, but it also the story of Penny Chenery Tweedy, played by Diane Lane. As others have pointed out, it isn't a documentary, it's a Disney film. Scretariat is riveting and beautiful. Reality of the times is hinted at but never examined thoroughly. Penny Chenery Tweedy stepped into a world run by men and triumphed. She was Secretariat's Champion in the movie, and perhaps in real life as well. Her bravery and determination shine through in the movie though I have to question whether it was as easy for her to make inroads as the movie portrays. Still, it is a shining example of the courage of the women who paved a way to make things easier for women today. Sometimes we forget that women had to stand up against preconceptions that placed them in lesser roles in days past. The movie is quite enjoyable but I think would've benefited by a few more horse training and racing scenes.The movie worked hard to portray the relationship between Penny Chenery Tweedy and Secretariat as well as her relationship with other people, but seemed to miss a bit of the glory of other horse racing movies that really focus on preparing the horse for the track. Secretariat is an inspiring, uplifting film that will encourage the watcher to keep working for their dreams.

B00006LJ6X|1.0|After Chicago VI which is my favorite album of all time, and a album that is short and sweet and full of many, many great, exciting songs, Chicago decided to record for VII a double album which opened the group's first three albums. The outcome: bad, bad mistake. Another problem is that the band members wanted to make an all jazz album, however, Peter Cetera was against the idea so in the end the album was half jazz/half pop, but add it all together and you have TOTAL CRAP! Chicago VII is an extremely disappointing, sour, and horrible album. The first five songs all instrumental, have no impact or punch and is a bunch of noise. If the group wants to make a sizzling, slick instrumental song at least have a kick to it. Example: Introduction in the band first album. Even though the song has a few lyrics, most of the song is instrumental and great, great to listen to. However, nothing of the sort exists in VII, just noise. As for the rest of the songs: Boring. Except, Call on Me. Overall, the album is a mess and after listening to it you feel depressed and angry. Skip this album. I love Chicago it's my all favorite music group and Chicago VI like I said before is my all favorite album. However, VII is in my list of the Top 10 worst albums ever. I guess even the great groups can make a dud and this is it.
B001KRVLCI|5.0|A few thoughts...<br /><br />I saw Face/Off in the theater when it came out.  I wasn't really expecting much before the lights were dimmed and the 20 minutes of previews started rolling.  But when the movie began, I was immediately drawn into it and it held my attention throughout.  This was one of the great action movies of the 1990s and really is one of the great action movies of all time.  John Travolta (as Sean Archer) and Nicolas Cage (as Castor Troy) give great performances.  It's funny to watch each of these guys \\"become\\" the other and make mistakes as the movie progresses.  The movie is packed with action galore, I mean really high intensity action.  I feel that this was the movie that really helped John Travolta shed the typecasting he suffered through beginning in the late 1970s.  He was always associated with movies such as Grease and Saturday Night Fever.  Nicolas Cage is a veteran when it comes to action movies, and he delivers big time in this one.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great action thriller that should satisfy your craving for over-the-top action and violence.  Highly recommended.

B0026P3G12|5.0|The international debut CD of British sensation Susan Boyle captures the essence of how music should be presented - light on the instrumentals and heavy on vocal clarity from a truly unique and remarkable singer.  These qualities, sadly, are few and far between in today's pop music.  Fortunately, Susan Boyle came along and brought with her the return of grace to both music and celebrity.<br /><br />I Dreamed a Dream - a most appropriate title, given the unprecedented response to her 2009 performance on Britain's Got Talent - captures the genuine beauty of Ms. Boyle's voice:  soft, soothing, even angelic, and most of all, powerful.  Plus it is clear as crystal.  Every syllable is annunciated to perfection, and every note is carried the way it is meant to be carried (as it was written).<br /><br />The title track is significantly toned down from when Ms. Boyle performed it live on television, but this in no way means it is any less rich in quality.  Her passion still resonates throughout the track, just as it does on every other song.  Many covers adorn I Dreamed a Dream, but my personal favorite is an original:  Who I Was Born To Be.  This song is so incredibly moving, you'll feel like you're accompanying Ms. Boyle on her life journey.  Just the title alone carries a great deal of meaning.<br /><br />Best wishes to you, Susan Boyle, on your music career, one that should have begun many years earlier.  Then again, if it hadn't, those outside the music establishment may not have the hope they now do, hope that it really is never too late to \\"dream a dream.\\"

B002BSHXJA|5.0|This set is awesome for both hardcore Beatles fans and beginners. The CDs are wrapped like the original records. For a nice price you get most of the Beatles collection all in one box in the original sound. Sound quality is terrific, even on the earliest recordings. I'm grateful.

0670022411|5.0|I typically read the amazon reviews before buying a book. This time I didn't and boy am I glad. I think the number of 3-, 2-, and 1-star reviews would have turned me away. I loved A Discovery of Witches and breezed through all 580 pages in two days. I knew from the get-go that it was the first in a trilogy, so I didn't expect closure at the end. The characters are complete and wholly likable. The descriptions were fabulous and I loved that the story moved from England to France to New York -- all of the settings were well described.   Give this book a chance. It's well worth it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I enjoy doing the routines in this workout dvd. I think they are fun to do and they are quick to do. I am getting results from doing one of the 20 minuet levels everyday.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|I gave 4 stars because the movie is well done and excellent performed by the actors. Extremely sad history about HUMAN ATROCITY.  Is very easy to reflect: \\"who have NO SOUL ? \\"  The story shows the WORST of heartless human being, exploting and abusing innocent people with feelings considered \\"creatures\\".  Really disgusting, sad, impressive story.

B004NSULHM|5.0|I could wax-on with tech descriptions of the songs offered on K.O.L. -but I think that's been served here quite properly. There is not another band making music today that is as fearless, creative or relevant. There are those who dig, like or love these chaps ...and there are those misfortunate souls who dont get it. Radiohead are THE musical geniuses of now, enjoy it!
B004LLDN3A|1.0|The online streamed version of this movie is NOT widescreen. It is pan & scan and looks like a low-quality YouTube video circa 2003.

B0036EH3U2|4.0|THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE COMPLETE SERIES (re-package/ Silver Box edition)Blu-Ray version<br /><br />(ergo: not the original Cylon Collectible figure version)<br /><br />The Box is decent if not wide for shelf space, but the 20 discs are organized into Seasons that are individually packaged within their own \\"binders\\" and packaging.<br /><br />Each Season features a Episode Guide that is specific per disc number.<br /><br />I grew up watching the original series. Yes the \\"disco\\" one. So I was a bit miffed when I saw the new version at varying times, on the SciFi/SyFy channel, and almost always seeming to turn it on during a Skinimax/soft porn scene. (THIS IS A MAJOR REASON why I couldn't give the Series a 5-star rating- some of us do care about content and other alternatives to portray love-making and the like artistically do exist.) Thus I did not regularly partake of the Series while it originally aired on TV. So for me this is mainly new territory in the long run.<br /><br />My other gripe is due to the religious over- and under-tones that seem to permeate the story arc of the Series.<br /><br />Had it not been for the above, and mostly the sexual scenes, this would be a TREMENDOUS offering to anyone's sci-fi catalog.<br /><br />Make no mistake the Story Telling, the re-hashing of a childhood favorite, is BRILLIANT !!! I am taken aback by the profound intellect and thought that has gone into such a vivid tale. The religious over- and under-tones do serve a purpose but there are moments when I do feel a bit offended as the dialog skirts the edge of blasphemy or sacrilege. However I get it: the gods vs. The God and the elements which make \\"us Human\\" are clearly what is displayed here.<br /><br />If you are a Family person, as I am, I warn that this is NOT for \\"the children,\\" perhaps teens and the such, but young ones DO NOT need to be bombarded with so much sexual content.<br /><br />For us older, mature folk, this is a massive ride that will reward one with sparks for conversation and thought.
B004IJZFP4|5.0|Unlike most of the \\"Deluxe\\" edition CDs coming out now, this CD is a very desirable retake on \\"Teaser\\", so much so that it is like a totally different album.  I'll always love the original versions of these songs, these different mixes/takes are much different and Tommy's guitar still rocks with his classic style.  It's a must have for any Bolin fan.  Excellent production quality too.
B004498KPU|2.0|First things first, we all know Michael Jackson is a great musician and artist.  There's no denying that.    However this compilation is a disgrace. Yes the sound is great (at 24-bit Linear PCM I would sure hope so), but the quality of the VIDEO is atrocious! And with this being a compilation of MJ's music VIDEOS one would expect pristine quality from one of the world's greatest entertainers.    The fact that the quality of some of these music videos has been better on DVDs released 3-4 years prior (not to mention the option of 5.1 Surround Sound) is depressing. Not only that, but some of the videos are incomplete!    So all in all, I wouldn't advise anyone to waste their money on something that is obviously a quick cash-in, especially when there are far better options available (Number Ones, HIStory on Film I & II, Dangerous - The Short Films to name a few).    Wait for a Blu-Ray release or get the other titles mentioned. Until then, avoid this thing at all costs.

He had the same face, the same brilliant white smile, but his whole form was suddenly composed of swirling black vapor, his eyes like electrical sparks in a living storm cloud. He sprouted black smoky wings and rose above the skywalk. If angels could be evil, Jason decided, they would look exactly like this.\\" (Page 19)     The Lost Hero is an adventure filled fantasy novel, written by Rick Riordan. It is the first book in a new series called \\"The Heroes of Olympus.\\" It is the story of a teenage boy named Jason, and his adventures to find a missing woman, and to remember who he is. These adventures take him across the country, and he finds that the world is nothing like he thought it was.      Although this book is probably meant for children ages 10-13, I believe that it is fit for any audience. Adults will find it intriguing to see how Riordan incorporate Greek and Roman mythology, and children will find Jason and his friend's adventures to be exciting and action filled. Any person who is familiar with Greek and Roman mythology will love Riordan's writing, because of the way he makes it seem more modern and exciting. What a great book!

B000FCKGPC|3.0|I fully agree with others in that Feast for Crows is a bridge to the next book. I plodded through hoping that something would happen. Alas. Please note that the digital edition is one dollar more than you would incur getting the actual book. Goes with all of the former books, too.

It's pretty much perfect.
B000TXR1GO|2.0|Kitchen Confidential seems to inspire two camps: a smaller admiring group, and a majority crew who find Mr. Bourdain boorish and irritating. Count me among the eye rollers.    As evidenced by his no-slouch-here writing, Mr. Bourdain seems to have a brain. Therefore, the book's big page-turner question is: *why doesn't he use it?* We keep expecting him to wake up from this macho posturing (that borders on self parody) and say *ah ha! catharsis time*. I read the book the whole way through and kept hoping for the turn, as they say in Texas Hold em. Surely this chef guy is going to hit some unexpected twist in his cook's tale and realize there's a larger vision of all this kitchen locker-room BS.    But rather than moving to a higher level, the book just spiraled downward. From hints dropped, we gather that the oh-so-busy Mr. Bourdain writes his books on his one day off from the restaurant. It has the feel of one foot in front of another, like an all-night march (it's he who loves to invoke military metaphors for his approach to kitchen management), wake up, pull on the boots, what chapter will it be today? We need a general in charge of this operation.    I'm not asking that Bourdain become the spokesman for NA and start playing Japanese bamboo flute on his kitchen's PA instead of Led Zepplin. But if your credo is drugs, sex, and rock n roll, after a while, we're ready for more than just concert footage. We want some writerly insight -it can be Lou Reed writerly, or Henry Rollins writerly, but just *some kind* of writer however-outlaw-- who can help us understand why this life that most of the country regards as a crazed waste actually has some redeeming grace. But Bourdain just hauls out another \\"simulated corpse in the deep freeze\\" anecdote, some more frat house humor, and we're left wondering ...    Bourdain has become enraptured with portraying himself as a sort of chef anti-hero, a Gingerman of the kitchen. (When I look at his cover photo, looking all serious withhis chef's whites and knife, I think - *aren't you embarrassed? *) If he was just a schlock wordsman, I wouldn't take the trouble to complain - the dude doesn't have the chops, oh well. But he's a good enough writer (and you'll note just about every last negative commentator finished the book, myself included) that we expect more.    There is a sweet-and-sour pleasure in having the lofty terrain of the upscale kitchen revealed to be the bawdy and, at times, far from appetizing place Bourdain portrays. But this sardonic friction is not enough to carry an entire book; the naughty-boy nose-thumbing only takes us so far. (Also, on an entirely different note, Bourdain seems completely uninterested in the value of food as a component of health.)    Bourdain is at his best in Kerouac-esque descriptions of the first real kitchen crew he aspired to join, in party-hardy Provincetown. His rollicking portrayal of that pirate crew is rich and gargantuan, and the hyperbole appropriate since this is understood to be seen through awestruck teenage eyes. But the book's unstated theme seems to be \\"I can be just as badass as those guys. I can! I can! I can!\\" To which this reader's response is, \\"OK you can, big deal.\\"
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|Why in the world would they delay the DVD release until September?  How long was in release, a month?  Ok, so it's not exactly a box office smash, but obviously, Disney is not going to make any money by leaving it an the vault for most of the year.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|I've never been a die-hard Britney fan until \\"Toxic\\" was released. Before that I liked her... but pop music has never been a favorite thing of mine. \\"...Baby One More Time\\" was actually the first album I ever bought (that was 1999 and I was seven), but it wasn't until she started experimenting with electronic music that I really gained immense admiration for her and her team.     Each and every album shows her evolution from pop to electronic. The songs \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Breathe On Me\\" were really the beginning of this evolution, and now with \\"Femme Fatale,\\" we have an insane techno album that is almost in every way perfect.     The first thing I noticed with this album is there are no sappy ballads. Do people actually listen to those on Britney Spears albums? I don't - I usually skip through them. But thankfully almost every single song on this album can be played in a club (\\"Criminal\\" is nowhere near as hard as the other tracks, and frankly, it's pretty stupid). And it's not all bubbly, happy dance music. There's dubstep and trance influence throughout.    My favorite tracks are \\"Till the World Ends\\" and \\"I Wanna Go.\\" \\"How I Roll\\" is also worth a mention. It has some pretty ridiculous lyrics (\\"I've got nine lives like a kitty cat\\") but some brave voice experimentation most pop artists wouldn't really bother with.    Yeah, her voice sucks. We all know Britney Spears can't really sing. But her whispery, girlish voice is all part of the act and if you take it for what it is, you'll see that she is a true entertainer.    5/5 stars!    EDIT: I read someone's review mentioning the cheap packaging of the CD, and I totally agree. The cardboard case ripped when I tried to get the CD out.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|\\"Shutter Island\\" was actually a pretty good film. It has a great 1954 setting and while the ending is a bit cliche for psychological thrillers (hope I didn't give much away), it really is worthwhile. The first time I saw it, I was a bit underwhelmed. I thought it really wasn't worth for watching again, but almost a year later, it's actually a good movie. The cinematography was one of my favorite things in the film, also. Some scenes look full of color and detail and some scenes look drained in color, with only one thing in color (similar to Schindler's List).        The setting was also great. It had good acting, and explains a lot (it IS 2 hours long). The island does look really creepy, along with some of the patients with their disturbing stories and a couple with freaky-looking faces. All of the scenes are executed extremely well and there are different things that make the film Oscar-worthy (although it didn't get nominated), but it still doesn't take anything away from the fact that it's a well-crafted film. Some of the scenes are also pretty disturbing and have an eerie vibe to them. There is an amazing climb-up of subtle scares and intense sequences into it's shocking finale (I guess it's kinda shocking in a couple ways).       \\"Shutter Island\\" is a movie any detective-mysery, thriller, or horror fan should see. It's a great film that wouldn't be torture to watch a few more times, unless you can't stand movies that are a bit on the long side, but if you like 2 hour movies, then you should probably see it.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I purchased the entire series & have had hours upon hours of watching Friends with lots of laughs. This is a great thing to own so you always have something funny to watch....all friends, all the time!!!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|\\"Cloverfield\\" is a pretty scary movie. It has a bit of everything in it. Horror, action, romance, comedy, drama; it has a lot of genres into it. The film isn't very long, and it may not have a lot to it, but it's still a very-well executed movie. The opening card in the beginning was pretty cool, with that \\"government\\" and \\"case designate Cloverfield\\" thing. That was an interesting way to begin the film. It finally rolls into the actual footage. The character development in the beginning was good, and I read  that in the reviews for this movie that the characters were \\"one-dimensional\\", but in basically every \\"found-footage\\" film the people are one-dimensional. I bet nobody would be complaining about that if the film had regular camera cuts and weren't found footage.       Anyway, besides that, after about 18 minutes, the action finally begins with a loud boom. This movie is more intense because it's a large group of people screaming and freaking out. Another thing that makes this film pretty creepy is that it has this \\"apocalypse\\" feel to it. There's a lot of running and terror in the film. I guess the running made people get motion sickness, but it's their fault that they got motion sickness. They're the ones who saw the movie and they saw that it was done on video camera, and it obviously involves running, so it's basically their fault. I like the extreme shaky camera, and the pixelation, and how in some scenes it would cut back to footage from a month ago for a couple seconds. I also like those freaky-looking spider creatures in that one subway scene. The special effects were also great (it only had a $25 million budget).        I like how they only show little bits and pieces of the monster throughout the movie and at the end you finally see the whole thing in front of the camera. It's pretty scary looking. The end obviously doesn't explain everything (that's what a lot of people complained about), but I actually think it ended really well, with a cliffhanger. At the last shot in the movie, I like when it cuts back to a month ago and the last line in the movie is \\"I had a good day\\". The film may not have a lot to it, like I said before. It plays out like this, the \\"a month ago\\" scene, the party scene, the running scene, the subway scene, the mall scene, hotel scene, and it finally shows the monster and after that there's a couple more minutes. It may sound like a good amount, but for a movie that's not much. I'm not complaining about it, because I think the movie actually played out really well.        The audio at the way end when you hear \\"Help us\\" and when it's played backwards, you hear \\"It's still alive\\", was pretty cool, because it adds on to the cliffhanger effect, and it does make the movie even more creepier. Altogether, I think that even 3 years after the release of Cloverfield, the film is still worth watching again.
B000NJMJGG|5.0|Ron Howard's best film, and Val Kilmer is a beast.  I loved this movie as a kid, and now as an adult it remains amazing.
B003Q6D1YW|4.0|\\"Catfish\\" isn't a found-footage film. It doesn't involve any death, running with video camera in hand, or screaming. It's really a thriller in a certain way that turns into a very melodramatic film in the 2nd half. That's what makes it unique. For anybody who loves mystery films, you might as well see \\"Catfish\\". In between the film, it'll normally have little sequences where it shows shots of Facebook, Google Maps, and other different things. Those sequences normally have music along with them. That's another unique thing about the movie, the music. In between the scenes, it'll occasionally have music, and I thought that was pretty cool. This is a film that's pretty down to Earth, but also, since it's \\"real\\" (it's really believable, actually), it seems too perfect.       The story is really cool also, since it can happen to anyone. Somebody meets a person on Facebook who isn't what they say they are. It has a certain type of thrill to it, that keeps increasing until about 40 minutes into the film, when the \\"barn scene\\" happens (it's shown at the end of the trailer). The thrill goes down and keeps slowly going up after that, and you just have to see yourself if you didn't already. This film had a very clever marketing scheme, with it's tagline \\"Don't let anyone tell you what it is\\", and the way the trailer was set up. It's really one of those films where it's extremely important that you don't give away, especially why it's called \\"Catfish\\".       \\"Catfish\\" is a unique documentary thriller twisted romance drama movie that'll you'll either love or hate.
B003L20ICE|1.0|I only watched about a third of this film.  The story may have been good, but the graphic sexual content turned my stomach.  Sorry, I don't need those kind of scenes to understand the story.
B000AWYOG4|1.0|There are many different things that ruin \\"Dark Water\\". In some ways, it could have possibly worked, but for me, it didn't. The review on the cover says that Hitchcock couldn't have done it better. That's a total and complete lie. Alfred Hitchcock would have made this film soooo much better with his amazing directing. That critic is underestimating what I think is the best director of all time. Anyway, besides that, the film has a very slow-paced and melodramatic, moody beginning. It makes you think that the slow build-up is going to really get the movie somewhere, but it really stays stagnant. Some scenes have an eerie vibe that have a certain potential, but none of the potential that I saw in this film is used properly.        The film also has a terrible ending. Why couldn't it be done in a different way? It just spoils the movie even more. The \\"ending to the ending\\" is also a huge drag. You keep thinking the film is going to end. Oh, wait a minute, there's about a minute more, and another minute after that, and then another, and it FINALLY ends, leaving me thinking \\"If only Hitchcock were alive to direct this film\\".
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Thanks Amazon! I would never have played this game if it wasn't for you. This works great on my EVO 4g. Keep them comming. I can't get enough.
0375831002|5.0|The title of my post basically says what I wanted to share.  I loved this book.  I just thought it had a unique style; it was clever.  I didn't want to put the book down and was sad when it ended.
B004Q3Q452|4.0|I've read all of Sophie Kinsella's books.  If you enjoy her other books, then you'll probably like Remember Me?.  The plot is pretty predictable but it's funny, lighthearted and enjoyable to read.      With that said, I don't think it's one of her best books though.  I loved The Undomestic Goddess, her Shopaholic series, and Can You Keep a Secret? more.
B003V5PPZG|4.0|i'm a 29 year old linkin park fan.  my favorite albums are \\"meteora\\", \\"hybrid theory\\", \\"a thousand suns\\", and \\"minutes to midnight\\".  in that order.      the sound is pretty far from their first two albums, seems more mature like minutes.  it's not as hard.  it took me some time to appreciate this album, at first i liked maybe 3 tracks but now i like 7.  i'm disappointed with some of the tracks because they seem to be fillers, the album could definitely have done without the 18 second track \\"empty spaces\\".      in closing suns was worth buying to me because although the sound matured, so did i. . . a little.  well enough to like it.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|I dont understand how this can be fun.  I saw the rating and it kept popping up on my recommendations, so i went ahead and bought it.. played all modes in 5 min and have never played it again.. i dont recommend. 2 * because it works as it should, and has nice graphix
B001FB5634|2.0|After about 15 minutes I realized it was one of those end of the world movies.  I don't get it.... They don't explain what has occurred to wipe out civilization, and then you get sucked into the worst depression that anyone can go through. Which is the struggle of Father to care for his kid in a mad max like ending. After about 30 minutes of post apocalyptic mayhem,  you start to rationalize suicide, too.  Maybe that why the movie is a hit? You say who can go on after something like that.  The whole movie was filmed in a strange grey-like nuclear winter, but they didn't say what it was that ended society.<br /><br />I had to actually come on here to read what other people said to figure out what I just seen. I still don't know what I just saw, I guess I'm still in shock.<br /><br />You know when the world ends you should be able to find all the can food of a lifetime. All the supplies of a lifetime.  All the ammo of a lifetime.<br /><br />What you won't find is people willing fight you for it.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|Really faster than the native android browser and with a proper tabs experience. Sometimes confuses the mobile vs the full html version of some pages like Google News. Overally strongly recommended.
0312323867|3.0|This is the follow-up to Giffin's Something Borrowed, told from Darcy's point of view.  In the previous book, the reader got to know Rachel White, the nice, smart, hard-working honest girl who was a lifelong friend of Darcy Rhone, the beautiful, superficial spendthrift who got by on her looks.  Rachel is set to be the maid-of-honor in Darcy's wedding, which is called off when Darcy realizes that Rachel is having an affair with Darcy's fiancee.  This novel picks up where that one leaves off, with Darcy realizing that she is pregnant by the best man of the would-be wedding, the result of some pre-marriage trysts of her own.  Darcy narrates this story, in which she decides she needs to leave New York and has an epiphany that she wants to be A Better Person.  It happens pretty neatly, actually.  She makes a list of qualities that \\"the new Darcy\\" should cultivate, and almost overnight she is a new version of herself.  Of course it's chick lit, and it's fun and light, so that can be forgiven, but the ending was also clear from the first twenty pages of the novel.  I did enjoy reading about the situation through Darcy's eyes, but was sad that even through Darcy's point of view, she didn't have many redeeming qualities to speak of.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|Thank you Arrived well before anticipated and as described. ++++<br />Love the whole series and am now sharing with my young grandsons.
0061537969|5.0|Excellent book, especially if you are a dog lover, but even if not.  I have read it twice, which is very unusual for me and have purchased this book for a relative recently.  I love this book written from a dog's point of view.  Those of you who may be skeptical about that idea, should try it before judging.  There are many, many life lessons within these pages and just a good read.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I cant get the app because I am from Brazil, but in Amazon site I can buy the whole world. Illogical. Solve it fast Amazon, please, Google music is coming...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app available. The user interface is great, everything works as expected, and it's very easy to get started. The additional features of sharing to Facebook or other social media is great, the Live feature is awesome, and the ever-expanding number of reading plans can fit nearly any schedule. The ability to download versions to be viewed offline is a great feature to have on an airplane or doctor's office where you don't have network connectivity. Overall, a stellar app.

B004EPYZU8|4.0|I highly recommend this movie. It's Charlie's Angels meets Kill Bill meets Anime meets Steampunk. Without giving too much away (because you have to get at least a short synopsis before you watch or you probably won't get what's going on--I didn't and had to look up the synopsis on my phone during the movie), Baby Doll is sent to a mental institution and her way of surviving this awful place is to fantasize that she's somewhere else and in control of her environment. Her fantasies give her and her fellow inmates the tools to survive and the means to plan their escape. Good action, incredible artistry, even better music! If you're into it, it's a great chick power movie.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Alotta fun, cant wait to play it again. Thank you halfbrick. Oh yeah................. Say it again, GO NINJA GO NINJA GO NINJA GO NINJA FRUIT
B000Y0GX9I|5.0|Produced entirely by hand, with every frame hand painted, this film is a demonstration of Walt Disney's vision, and the skill and commitment of animators and artists long before the advent of computer generated animation.  Even if you don't like classical music or disney characters, this is a piece of history made available to everyone by virtue of digital technology. It should be part of every DVD collection.

I won't tell you who but this will not dissapoint you!<br />BUY THIS BOOK! Also if you enjoy Rick Riordan... Try The Kane Chronicles!!!!!! Another adventure but including egyptian mythology!
B000ZECQ08|5.0|While this movie seemed a bit slower and moodier than previous ones, I enjoyed seeing it brought to life none the less. The ongoing character development of our familiar friends has come through loud and clear; especially the interactions among Harry, Hermoine, Ron and Ginny. The characterization of Professor Slughorn was spot-on and the usual high caliber acting of all the 'faculty' was quite welcome when you consider the length of this saga and the tendency for actors to become overly familiar with their respective roles.My only criticism of this movie was the fight that lead up to Dumbledore's death...the book was much more exciting and I was somewhat let down by the movie. All in all, I felt that this movie did a great job setting up the Deathly Hallows.    I would also like to comment that the seller was lightning quick with his/her response in filling my order. Thanks for your prompt attention.    This movie was packed with the usual extras and I recommend it to all Potter fans.

B004NOH9LW|2.0|first, PLEASE mr. eastwood: stop scoring your own movies! the overly-sentimental music takes all the edge out of this film (and the guitarist plays as if handcuffed to a written score). this really bothered me; much of the drama in \\"hereafter\\" is diluted by the music.<br /><br />there is a good idea (several actually) floating around here, but the movie is slow, plodding. we have to wait a long time for the inevitable: that these people will somehow connect, and share something. a great subject, just needed to be told with more urgency, \\"magic\\" even.<br /><br />am inspired to watch \\"gran turino\\" again; a smaller film, but a much-better one...
B004LP601S|5.0|Vices and Virtues is a welcome return to the theatrical over the top vaudevillian sound of the album that made me fall in love with them A Fever You Can't Sweat Out. After the disappointment that was Pretty.Odd. with it heavy mid 1960s Beatles influences it was nice to see Panic! return to its emo-punk roots. My favorite tracks are \\"the Ballad of Mona Lisa\\", \\"Let's Kill Tonight\\", \\"Hurricane\\", \\"Sarah Smiles\\", and the heavily Ryan Ross influenced \\"Nearly Witches {Ever Since We Met..}\\". Overall if you liked their first allbum then you definitely love Vices & virtues.
B004KSQN7C|3.0|I just got done listening to the whole CD. It's definately like \\"Blackout\\". I thought it was so-so. It is very upbeat. However, i don't really care for the techno sound. Not one single ballad. Disapointing!
0345505387|3.0|This was not the kind of book that I was expecting at all. It was alright to read but I was disappointed and was expecting something totally different. I can't wait for the next book in the Outlanders series   to come out.

B0034K2DM6|4.0|While it is disappointing to not have the entirety of World War Z performed by such great voice actors, the stellar cast more than made up the difference for me.     Along with a number of other good voice actors, some vignettes are performed by the likes of Alan Alda, Carl and Rob Reiner, Mark Hamill, Henry Rollins, and John Turturro. The narrator is of course Max Brooks, who brings all the earnestness of his public appearances to his role as the interviewer.      While not the 5-Star epic it could have been, I urge you to check it out and make your own decision. It's pretty cheap right now here on Amazon.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is a free game! yes you have to install the appstore, but what is the difference between that and having annoying ads in the other versions!? So those complaing about the appstore should rethink their position.  I hated the ads in the earlier versions! This release is better looking and smoother playing. Plus getting an already cheap form of addictive entertainment for FREE is pretty sweet too!
B004NSULHM|5.0|I have always been about the finer details. Whether if it's clothing, food, packaging, film, and of course music. Radiohead being who they are, they are highly creative, technically savvy, and produce songs to minute details. That brings us the The King of Limbs. Another, Radiohead sounding album. Although short in length, each song is highly edited, dubbed, and elegantly written. They again take influence from many sources to make their own. It's obvious that The Low End Theory's Beat Music, UK Dubstep, and again electronica had a good amount of influence on this LP. It keeps their sound fresh, but  Radiohead always maintains their own characteristics. I will not describe each song, but will let you be the decider. I love this album very much, and can't wait for my Newspaper album to placed at my doorstep! If you don't own a good sound system or headphones, I suggest you go out in get one, as every minor glitch, clap, drum, synth, etc will really show in HiFi. Enjoy!
B001IAOEXU|4.0|They clip on and stay on unless you drop the controller from pretty high.   They keep your sweaty and oily fingers from sliding off during intense games.    They don't seem to be any more accurate. You would think that with the extension, it would work like a lever, where you could be more precise. You can't be more precise. The curve forces your fingers towards the upper (towards L1 and R1) which gives your fingers the same if not less travel distance. Travel distance is what your need for precision.    Overall, I've loved it. Hasn't affected my performance in a negative way yet.
1568490119|5.0|I found this book to be an interesting read. Although it was written some time ago, it's very moving and is applicable to today's world.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is John Mayers best studio album, and its one of my all time favorite albums. The only song on here that I actually dislike is I'm gonna find another you which is at the end. My favorite song on the album is slow dancing in a burning room; this song has Mayers best hook. Some of my other favorites include dreaming with a broken heart, heart of life, belief, and stop this train. Waiting on the world to change is so overrated, but its a still a good song. Its just not better than some of the others song I've mentioned.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|Won't run on the eLocity A7. I guess since the eLocity does not have a GPS; apps that access that feature in Android crash and burn.
0060936223|5.0|Patti's words are heartfelt and she communicates a vulnerable retelling of her time as a young artist in New York and of the relationship she shares Robert Mapplethorpe. They are literally \\"just kids\\" when the story begins but they grow as artists and as individuals over the years. Patti's voice is sincere and unassuming. Her writing is precise and poetic. This is one of my favorite reads ever and has started me on a search to find every poem and every song ever penned by Patti Smith.  For me as a young woman in my 20s, innovative figures like Patti are hard to find.
0670022411|1.0|All the positive reviews were very encouraging, so much that I stayed strong and finished the book. I was disappointed to say the least. It's very slow moving and so frustrating you have to put it down, stomp around the room to calm down, regain composure and continue reading. What bothered me the most was the main heroine (if you can call her that) in the story. I found her to be very whiny and annoying from the start. She (Diana) was apparently very scholarly and highly achieved historian. Yet she made so many decisions that had me wondering how she could be so stupid. Then, of course, once she fell in love with a unbelievably gorgeous, yet mysterious and misunderstood vampire (oh heavens I haven't heard that one before!) she becomes utterly useless. Maybe it's just me, but I hate it when a female character gives up her entire life and literally can't function without her man. She does nothing but pace and sit on the sofa until he returns from an international trip. Useless!   I kept thinking to myself \\"this has to get better, this has to get better, please get better\\" and it did....a little....not enough to save it. If anything, the more exciting parts proved how useless Diana is. I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to anyone else. If you enjoyed twilight (I did not, do not get me started on that) then you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, save your money.

B003UESJKQ|5.0|The Best Horror Film Ever!!!  I have seen all of the commentaries in the DVD's and specials about the making of Jaws.  Spielberg continually criticizes his choice to film on the sea & even the making of the film but I believe that he succeeded beyond his wildest imagaination. I personally feel that it was great that the shark did not have lots of \\"Screen Time\\" because that is what makes JAWS a truly terrifying movie. I have seen the movie over 125 times and I am still scared when the head of Ben Gardner pops out of the boat and when the shark leaps onto the ORCA. THAT IS WHAT MAKES A GREAT HORROR MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The suspense, the feeling that something big is going to happen, something that really hits home (it could really and truly happen.)  When you compile the best Horror movies of all time there are some great ones... Dracula, Frankenstein, Halloween and scores of others.  The one that really stands out in my mind is JAWS (the original.)  The Original worked not just because of a great story written by Peter Benchley but because on a great cast of actors.  Every scene in the movie is very believable and is just captivating.  When I watch it at home when I have to stop or pause the movie I hate doing it because I get so caught up in it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Much improved over the originals! I love the new menu interface, the scheduled updates, the extra details, the 3d like improvements. But boy are those monkeys hard to kill!
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I have only been a Bonamassa fan for a couple of years now.... when I first heard him I was impressed with his versatility as a guitar player. He covered tha gamit of rock and blues and he did it with his own style. With so many Guitar-slingers and SRV wannabe's, I found Joe Bonamassa to be original and sincere, playing some of the greatest classic songs with his own unique blend plus writing some really good songs of his own. My Joe Bonamassa collection has bulked up over the past couple of years, and now he seems to be in a period of creative genius where I find albums rolling out in short due. His collaborations with other artists indicate that Joe is a musician, not just another egotistic \\"Hey. Look at me!\\" guitar player. I saw Joe in Wilmington Delaware last year and he was tremendous. DUST BOWL shows Joe coming into his own. He has developed a sound that is strictly Joe Bonamassa and each album has that stamp that automaticly makes you recognize him. But its not same ole same ole stuff...its fresh and crisp and so very clean. Joe Bonamassa is a winner and every album he has released these past couple years demonstrate his greatness as a musician. If you like this style of Blues/ Rock, you cannot go wrong with any Joe Bonamassa CD.
0316017922|5.0|Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell is a must read.  This book focuses on many different stories of success along with the factors that helped individuals become successful.  Most people believe success depends on the intelligence of these individuals; however, Gladwell makes a very strong argument that success depends more on other factors that surround the individuals.  For example, success depends on the year they were born, the time of year they were born, opportunities that were presented to them, and even their family history.  Gladwell also proposes a new rule for success: the 10,000 hour rule.<br />Malcolm Gladwell is a successful writer.  According to his website, [...], \\"He is the author of four books, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Make a Big Difference, (2000), Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking (2005), an Outliers: The Story of Success (2008) all of which were number one New York Times bestsellers. His latest book, What the Dog Saw (2009) is a compilation of stories published in The New Yorker\\" (Gladwell, 2010).  Malcolm Gladwell has written many books on complex thoughts.  After reviewing the titles of his other books it seems the trends in this book may have been revealed to him through his research.<br />One main idea Gladwell suggests in his book is the 10,000 Hour Rule.  This rule states that in order for people to truly master their profession, they must complete 10,000 hours of practice.  One example Gladwell uses to explain this rule is the story of one of the most famous rock bands, the Beatles.  Before the Beatles became famous rock stars, they were invited to play at a club in Hamburg, Germany.  Playing at the club involved doing eight hour shows, sometimes seven days a week.  Within two years the Beatles were able to complete over 10,000 hours of practice together as a band.  Without the amount of practice the Beatles had received at Hamburg, they would not have been as successful.  Gladwell makes it a constant theme that in order for an individual to be successful, he or she needs to get at least 10,000 hours of practice.  In order for people to get enough practice, there needs to be opportunities and outside help from others.<br />  Gladwell starts his book with an example of successful Canadian hockey players all being born in the beginning months of the year.  He uses this example to show that success can depend upon an individual's birth date.  For this specific example, the cut-off date for hockey players in specific age groups is December 31; therefore, having a birthday in January would give players an advantage.  At a young age, being 11 to 12 months older is a huge advantage.  The players who are more physically matured would be picked to play on the hockey team over the younger players.  Once being picked to play on the hockey team, these players have more time to practice, which means they will have a better chance to advance in the sport.  It also means that these players will complete their 10,000 hours of practice before the younger kids who were not picked.  Gladwell continues to explain that success in school and other sports depends on an individual's birthday when a cut-off date is involved.  While reading this book, I could relate to this example.  I played soccer growing up and in the league I played in the cut-off date was in September.  My first year of travel soccer was very hard.  Most of the other girls were older than me because my birthday was in August.  I received very little playing time because I was smaller and became very discouraged.<br /> Another factor that success is dependent upon is the year that an individual was born.  In this book, Gladwell shows a list of the seventy-five richest people in human history.  Following this list, Gladwell explains that about 20 percent of people on this list were born in the United States during the nineteenth century.  Gladwell continues to explain that given the year these people were born, theywere the perfect age to take advantage of the changes that America was going through during the industrial revolution.  The year a person was born plays a significant role in determining if an individual will be a successful outlier.<br />Opportunities are a major part of becoming successful.  Gladwell explains that people are not successful on their own, and they need to be given the opportunity to become successful outliers.  An example Gladwell uses in his book is the story of Bill Joy.  Bill Joy went to the University of Michigan, which happens to be one of the first universities to have a computer lab that used time-sharing.  He was lucky enough to live in the North Campus where the Computer Center was located.  Because he had access to a computer, Bill Joy was able to have 10,000 hours of practice before other student his age which helped him become one of the few expert programmers.  Gladwell also gives the example of Bill Gates.  When Bill Gates was in the eighth grade he had joined a computer club at school where he had access to a computer.  During that time period, most colleges still did not have computer labs for students to have access to computers.  Bill Gates had an amazing opportunity to use and master a computer at such a young age.<br />Another point Gladwell talks about in his book Outliers, is that success depends on a person's family.  Qualities that are instilled in children by their parents often determine the amount of success that their children may achieve.  These qualities include independence, problem solving, and social skills.  Gladwell also explains that a child coming from a wealthy family has a better chance to be successful.  My uncle is very wealthy and has spent a great deal of money helping his son pursue a career in hockey.  From the time my cousin was little, he has had the opportunity to purchase the best training and the best equipment.  Because his family could afford it, he was able to travel and play on some of the best teams in the country.  Therefore, being introduced to the best hockey coaches he is now playing on one of the junior national teams, and will be going to Michigan State on a full scholarship for hockey.<br /> Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers: The Story of Success is a great book.  This book gives insight to the reasons people achieve great success.  Outliers explains the importance of practice and opportunities that are given to individuals in order to be successful.  This book also explains that certain factors for success are uncontrollable by the individual including birth date and family financial status.  Everybody should read Outliers: The Story of Success to be able to understand the factors involved for individuals to achieve success.perfect age to take advantage of the changes that America was going through during the industrial revolution.  The year a person was born plays a significant role in determining if an individual will be a successful outlier.     Opportunities are a major part of becoming successful.  Gladwell explains that people are not successful on their own, and they need to be given the opportunity to become successful outliers.

Bill Joy went to the University of Michigan, which happens to be one of the first universities to have a computer lab that used time-sharing.  He was lucky enough to live in the North Campus where the Computer Center was located.  Because he had access to a computer, Bill Joy was able to have 10,000 hours of practice before other student his age which helped him become one of the few expert programmers.  Gladwell also gives the example of Bill Gates.  When Bill Gates was in the eighth grade he had joined a computer club at school where he had access to a computer.  During that time period, most colleges still did not have computer labs for students to have access to computers.  Bill Gates had an amazing opportunity to use and master a computer at such a young age.        Another point Gladwell talks about in his book Outliers, is that success depends on a person's family.  Qualities that are instilled in children by their parents often determine the amount of success that their children may achieve.  These qualities include independence, problem solving, and social skills.  Gladwell also explains that a child coming from a wealthy family has a better chance to be successful.  My uncle is very wealthy and has spent a great deal of money helping his son pursue a career in hockey.  From the time my cousin was little, he has had the opportunity to purchase the best training and the best equipment.  Because his family could afford it, he was able to travel and play on some of the best teams inthe country.  Therefore, being introduced to the best hockey coaches he is now playing on one of the junior national teams, and will be going to Michigan State on a full scholarship for hockey.     Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers: The Story of Success is a great book.  This book gives insight to the reasons people achieve great success.  Outliers explains the importance of practice and opportunities that are given to individuals in order to be successful.  This book also explains that certain factors for success are uncontrollable by the individual including birth date and family financial status.  Everybody should read Outliers: The Story of Success to be able to understand the factors involved for individuals to achieve success.

0061245097|4.0|I gave the first book in the series three stars, and wasn't sure if I would continue reading.  I didn't want to give up so easily, so I bought books two and three.  To sum it up, the Night Huntress Series is a mindless (which is not always bad) and fun story to read.  It doesn't require a lot of thinking and guessing as to what will happen.  The plot is often times repetitive with it's vampire slaying and vampire loving scenes.  The characters lack a certain depth that usually draws me into a book, but they all work well together.  From the beginning, I think I was expecting something completely different from this series; maybe that's why I was a bit critical.
B002EPWTLC|2.0|Do not purchase this 2009 version!... It is not the original!  My best advice is to purchase the 2002 Version.<br />Why?... Well basically, you will get better definition image, subtitles!!! and much better audio definition!...<br />I bought the original first, and then wanted to give as a gift the new version to my father... Oh surprise, I had to give my father my original one and return the 2009 Version.<br />So, I hope you get the point, you deserve to see Rieu's performance in the original Version!
B003UESJF6|4.0|I absolutely love Will Ferrel, he is so funny in a careless sort of way. Anyway I thought  this movie offered so much more than was expected. At first I didn't want to watch it cause it reminded me of the alien bad guy in \\"Monsters vs Aliens\\" and I seriously thought THAT movie was a bore. But this is great and nothing like M vs A. There is plenty of creativity and funny dialogue, the characters develope brilliantly and the whole plot is enjoyable from beginning to end. Kids loved it, I loved it... Highly recommended
0470901071|5.0|Todd Lammle's CCNA study guide is by far the best book published which contains the necessary material for learning CCNA.  It's a great study guide for people already in the field who are looking to obtain CCNA certification as well as for beginners in the networking field. Mr. Lammle's ability to explain complicated concepts, his methodology in breaking down subnetting, exercises at the end of each chapter along with answers and explanations enables the reader to test their knowledge and review their skills.  The extra exams that are included with the CD give additional practice.      The book contains multiple examples, problems and resolutions, different network topologies and provides one with a strong foundation on utilizing CISCO's equipment, IOS and mastery of important commands.
B004LFO0ME|2.0|I caught on to Wiz after I listened to his Kush and OJ mixtape, which I thought was a classic.  So my hopes were high for this official release.  I have only listened to Rolling Papers a few times, but I am truly disappointed.    I cannot stand the song, \\"Roll Up\\" it has too much of a pop feel, which is the theme for pretty much the entire album.  Its like he was trying to do BoB type numbers or he tried to hard to make a mainstream album.    \\"Black and Yellow\\" was cool when it was first released, but now I find it extremely repetitive.    I think that is the problem with some of the successful mixtape rappers, they cut loose on their mixtapes, but on their official studio release they try too hard and it ends up sounding weak.  He was trying to cater too much to the mainstream, and I think he chose to say, \\"screw the Taylor Gang\\" on this one.  He is trying to win a grammy with this pop-rap release.  Leave the pop-rap to the Black Eyed Peas and Flo-rida, Wiz.    His lyrics are weak and some of the beats sound like Jason Mraz produced them. \\"Fly Solo?\\"     The only song I am feeling is \\"On My Level\\" because the beats is hard, a 90's West Coast vibe to it.  But putting Too Short on as your feature was a strange move that did not work.  Maybe Snoop, (who has also gone straight pop) would have been better.    Maybe I am a little too critical because Kush & OJ was so dope, but I don't think so.  This album was made for the ladies and teenage chronic smokers, not true hip-hop heads like your truly.    In summary, pick up Kush & OJ and put it on repeat.  Don't waste your money on Rolling Papers, I hate to say it, but it is wack.

B000068TPN|1.0|This movie was just HORRIBLE. To all the people giving this movie four and FIVE(?) stars - have you not heard/seen all of these cliches before, or is it that you just don't watch a lot of films? Sam Elliot: \\"If any of ya' greenhorns call me grandpa... I'll kill ya\\". Gibson's pep talk to troops: \\"Did you know that when Crazyhorse was an infant, he was nursed by every woman in the tribe\\". Oh really Mel... even if they weren't lactating? LOL! Dying soldiers last words: \\"I'm glad to die for my country\\". I could go on and on with the cliches but I don't want to re-live them again. And who in the world cast this movie? Sam Elliott: here's a guy that in EVERYTHING I've ever seen him in he tries so damn hard to be cool, the man's man, Mr. mysterious, the \\"I'll kick your butt at the drop of a hat but when I get around the ladies or my brothers in arms I have a deep soul\\" guy, that it comes off looking ridiculous. Every time I watch him act all I can think of is John Wayne. No Thanks. Gregg Kinnear: Doesn't belong in this movie. Mel Gibson: looks silly in this movie. In the movie Hair, there's a scene in which the hippy played by Treat Williams dresses up in someone elses army uniform to gain access to an army base. It's a comedic scene because the uniform doesn't fit right and looks silly. This is how Mel Gibson looks in this film.<br /><br />If you're one of the folks giving this movie 4 or 5 stars... you bought in.<br />I could tell that this movie was trying desperately to tug at the heartstrings. But 3/4 in I had to turn it off because I was O.D.ing on corniness.

B003XL6EKS|5.0|I actually already purchased the regular edition of Flamingo. So, this was actually for my girlfriend. In my opinion, the album is great. The bonus songs are good, not great. But, they are a still nice addition to an already fantastic album.     The extra artwork and improved packaging are also a nice addition.    I'd recommend this to any fan of Brandon Flowers, and The Killers.
B0038ONFXO|1.0|I fell asleep about two-thirds into this sequel when there seemed to be nothing at all happening. Colin Firth is dull as dirt as the dashing boyfriend lawyer, while Renee Zellweger's main joke is her fattened up appearance. The problem is there is no chemistry at all between the two, so we don't believe for even a second that Mark Darcy \\"loves\\" her, as he professes. And ditto for Hugh Grant who does and says nothing amusing. I didn't laugh even slightly, not even once, during this way too long comedy. Time to put this yarn to bed for good...
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is by far one of the only books that sucked me into the depths of despair. I found myself constantly having to put the book down after reading so many chapters in a row. Collins' dystopia is so genuine and real that I felt heavily oppressed and hopeless at times that I ended up having to walk away to something happier for a while. And where I felt like an outsider looking in on Katniss in Catching Fire, Mockingjay turned that feeling around and I felt like I was following along right beside her.    This is not to say that the book is bad and I didn't like it. It is the perfect completion to the series. There were just so many times that I could empathize with poor Katniss at being used as a tool for everyone else's purposes. Even when everything was over, her life was still not her own. Collins truly portrays an utter hopelessness.     Just as in the two previous books, Collins wrote a character that was easily attachable for me. I was really rooting for Finnick, especially after he found Annie again. Katniss had so few people who were genuinely on her side with no motive to further their own means. And she seemed to lose them at the most horrible times. But Finnick's fate was no different and I felt sad at his loss. Still only Rue made me cry, but I think by then I was just expecting someone else to go. It was just a matter of who.    The end is a little disappointing, but I don't see how Katniss's life could go any other way. Any tying up in neat, tidy little rainbow colored bows would not have been true to Katniss. I am glad that Peeta's story was happier. The last chapter just seemed like an afterthought, a \\"by the way, in case you were wondering\\".     As with the other two books in the series, I would recommend Mockingjay to everyone.

0385341008|2.0|The book The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society came recommended to me.  I love books about World War II.  I have read other books like this one, where the format is all letters back and forth to others.  I don't mind that format.  This book was a light weight read, and it wasn't bad, as I finished the book.  But there wasn't a ton to keep me going.  Thank goodness for a good personality on Juliet (I am pretty sure that was her name, the main character), because her having such a great personality is what kept the book going for me.  She is somebody I think I would have liked in real life, and her personality brought a great sense of humor to much of the book. But her character is really all I found myself caring about and propelling me to read any further.  All in all, it wasn't a bad book, but could have done more to capture my interest.  A light fluffy read, and interesting take on the war.
0439023491|5.0|I didn't start reading The Hunger Games trilogy until after all the books had been released. So I was a little disappointed to find Katniss's world turned upside down in Catching Fire after it seemed like she'd just gotten everything back in place by the end of The Hunger Games. It was disheartening to discover that she had created much more serious trouble from such a simple act in the Arena.<br /><br />Collin's further develops the relationships between Peeta/Katniss and Gale/Katniss in such a way that I kept finding myself flip flopping between which couple I wanted to be together in the end. I also became very attached to Cinna. He was one of my favorites from The Hunger Games, but Collins did a wonderful job of bringing him more to life as more than just a Capitol drone. And while he couldn't replace Rue for me, he was just as good to Katniss as Rue had been.<br /><br />The oppressive feel from The Hunger Games wasn't as strong in Catching Fire because everyone was starting to join the revolutionary bandwagon. The 'forget about the consequences' wave really made me rally behind the Districts. I didn't find myself encompassed in Collins's world like I did with the Hunger Games, but she still was able to describe it with real dimension.<br /><br />Just as with The Hunger Games, I would recommend Catching Fire to everyone.

B002ZG99TA|3.0|Chris Pine (Star Trek) and Denzel Washington (Man on Fire) star as a pair of train conductors who bravely chase down a runaway train throughout Pennsylvania, which is loaded with lethal toxic chemicals.<br /><br />First off, what does this movie do wrong? Well, ALMOST EVERYTHING! The characters are stock, cardboard cutouts with little personality. The dialogue is painfully schmaltzy and overdramatic. Tony Scott's directing is ALL OVER the place, complete with unnecessary flashing, goofy zoom-ins, and a bit of shakey-cam thrown in for bad measure. Admittedly however, his work isn't quite as bad as that on the \\"Pelham 1, 2, 3\\" remake. Oh, and how many cliches? Dad with estranged daughters? Check. Guy with estranged girlfriend who will seek redemption by risking his life? Check. The big business mogul who cares on about the company's losses and not those of innocent people? Check. A corny high-fiving ending? Double check.<br /><br />On the upside, I did like the stuntwork and action sequences. They were pretty well-staged and genuinely intense. Also, I liked how practical FX were primarily used; no CGI here folks, we actually a train crashing through stuff and real, on-camera helicopters chasing it down with real stuntmen hanging from the choppers. Good stuff.<br /><br />Overall, if you can get past the lame and painfully cliched storyline and melodramatic acting, the action setpieces are worth the wait and a good way to run down 100 minutes.

1439177783|3.0|The story of Portia's rise to fame, all the time struggling with inner demons and sexuality issues is an interesting story, and there is no doubt that Portia De Rossi is a talented writer.  Her prose is excellent, and the book is well constructed and thoughtful.    So that is a definite plus for this book.    The book covers in extensive details her thoughts and anxieties about her weight and the incredibly sad regime she maintained to keep herself thin.   But after a while of reading about the problems, I started to lose interest a little.   I enjoyed the interactions she had with other people in her life, plus hearing about life behind the scenes of a hit show, but reading about the crazy thoughts she had, and her rituals - in such great detail - just became a bit tiresome to me.   Those who have struggled with similar issues, will probably be able to relate to it more than I, and might find it more interesting.   Let me add, I was interested in what made her become so obsessed with weight loss, but just not to the extreme it was written about.    Overall, a well written story, but fell a bit short of my expectations.     But, I do think Portia de Rossi, should pursue writing as a career, because she obviously has a talent for it.
0439023483|5.0|It's taken me a long while to think about what to say about The Hunger Games trilogy. I really liked the books and they've earned a permanent place in my collection, but I wouldn't necessarily say they were enjoyable. There are many aspects that bring happiness to Katniss's life. But overall, the world Collins creates is very bleak, sometimes shocking with how oppressed the people are and what they are willing to let happen to them.    Collins's characters for the most part are full of depth and reality. I found myself very attached to Rue. It's not often that a book can move me to tears, but I was genuinely upset with what happens to her. So much so that even mentioning her later in the series had me tearing up then. While I related more to Katniss's personality, I couldn't love her as much as I did Rue. On the opposite end of the scale, I found Katniss's mother to be very shallow and two-dimensional, as if she was there only to serve the plot and not be a living, breathing character affected by all the change around her.    As much as I loathed the fate of some characters, it was refreshing not to see Collins hampered by death in a teen book. The lesson that human brutality may occur without any violence or lifting a finger was portrayed well, in addition to those scenes where violence was present. The world Collins creates is so detailed and rich I often found my dreams trapping me in Katniss's bleak world. There were times that I would take a break and have to remind myself that it was okay to go outside because the world in which I live is not as oppressive as hers.     I would definitely recommend this to anyone over 13. While I don't discourage anyone under 13 from reading it, I don't think the maturity level for anyone much younger is at a place to truly appreciate Katniss's struggle. Although, the violence may be disturbing for younger readers as well.

6304936303|4.0|\\"Top Gun\\" director Tony Scott's adrenaline-laced, testosterone-fueled, high-octane actioneer \\"The Last Boy Scout\\" qualifies as an ultra-violent, hideously misogynistic, hard-boiled criminal melodrama about an unlikely pair of pals who thwart a gang of sinister, trigger-happy thugs who advocate sports gambling legalized. These slimy villains are prepared to pay millions to achieve their goal, and they have no qualms about killing anybody who interferes with their plans. The heroes are a hard-boiled private eye who once served as a Secret Service agent and took a bullet for President Jimmy Carter and a former professional football quarterback with a million dollar throwing arm banned from the game for gambling. Typically, the director is considered the auteur, and Scott delivers his signature touches: rapid-fire editing, gauzy-looking shafts of illumination back-lighting doors, windows, staircases,etc., and the alternation of telephoto shots with looming close-ups. Indeed, \\"The Last Boy Scout\\" emerges as a glossy, slickly-produced epic, and Scott stages everything with style and aplomb to spare. The downtown shoot-out at a strip joint rivals anything in an early Steven Seagal movie. Scott thrusts you into the thick of the action without going overboard. Mind you, the explosions are massive fireballs of black smoke and orange flames. In this respect, Tony surpasses his famous older brother Ridley at delivering orgasmic action scenes. Ridley, however, has achieved greater critical and commercial success. Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans constitute the unlikely, interracial heroic duo, and their friendship gets off on a contentious foot before they set aside their feelings and deal with the obnoxious villains who are capable of the worse violence.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the real auteur of \\"The Last Boy Scout\\" is \\"Lethal Weapon\\" scribe Shane Black. Black is attracted to direct opposites. Consider the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" franchise as well as \\"Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang.\\" Remember the suicidal Mel Gibson detective who is teamed up with the pragmatic Danny Glover. These two were are different as night and day, with Glover as the night and Gibson as the day. In \\"Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang,\\" an actor and a gay private eye team up to take on the villains. Happily, the tough but sympathetic heroes in \\"The Last Boy Scout\\" never get a break, and they have a disarming way of handling their setbacks. Black's crude but witty dialogue exchanges between the hard-nosed Willis and the articulate Wayans undercuts a lot of the hard-as-nails gritty action. Quite possibly, anybody who has trouble hearing the repetitious use of the F-word will find this dialogue offensive. Meanwhile, Willis and Wayans generate charisma galore as they play off each other. Black's twists and turns in the narrative, his clever use of foreshadowing, and the wicked villains make this vigorous, 105-minute, mystery yarn entertaining to watch. Indeed, everything is by-the-book, but Black skillfully presents these conventional elements in such compelling fashion that you can overlook their formulaic origins. One of the funniest scenes in \\"The Last Boy Scout\\" occurs early on when our beleaguered hero comes home to find his wife cheating on him. He knows that something is wrong when he catches a glimpse of the commode in the bathroom with the seat raised. Anybody who has lived with a woman for any length of time knows that they hate it when a man leaves the toilet seat up because they may sit down and fall into the commode.<br /><br />This stylist, slam-bang shoot'em up ranks as one of Scott's better efforts. He turns everything into a larger-than-life situation. Nobody can dispute that \\"Top Gun\\" and \\"True Romance\\" show Scott at the top of his game. \\"The Last Boy Scout\\" is gripping from start to finish.idal Mel Gibson detective who is teamed up with the pragmatic Danny Glover.

B003KK65KG|4.0|I enjoy Jodi's books as they tackle a lot of subjects that are difficult. This is the story of a school massacre told from the eyes of the shooter and his family. There were a lot of \\"real\\" moments, but too much filler to give this book 5 *. I am sure this is a book that I will read again.
0385341679|4.0|The short review: The book was good. It wasn't perfect, but it was good, and good enough.    The long review: **Spoiler Alert** I am a series junkie.  Sometimes when they end, I am elated.  Sometimes, not so much.  This ending fell on the good side, but not totally perfect.  With a series, you usually need a lot of things resolved when you get to the final book.  I think this book did resolve much of what we were looking for, but not everything.   I do feel like some of the characters that had been built up in the previous books were a let down in this one.  The Highlander clan and Christian in particular.  I really felt like his character just got tossed aside, and left, so open that it seems there must be a book out there in his future.  He was very much a good guy, that deserved a better ending than where he was left, in limbo, with this book.    Other than that, I think I am satisfied with pretty much everything else.    Considering the push to get out a perfect book, and the pressure that the author must have been in, I believe it was a good end result.  Again, not perfect, but well worth the read and satisfying enough.

I've stopped and restarted  to get through the disc, cleaned and recleaned the player and skips continue.   I tried Disc #24 several times on two different DVD players and it appears to be completely blank!     Love this series, but this is a disappointment.  April 25...I am now on  Season 7 and again find all discs very difficult to run.

0307279189|4.0|First, this book tells a good story. It meanders through colorful characters, rather eccentric most of them, & difficult terrains. Threads emerge & dissolve in this largely straightforward storyline, but for me the two aspects, woven into the larger story, that set this book apart are the science & philosophy of running.<br /><br />First, the philosophy. Essentially, this book projects running as a 'flow' experience. Not grit, not determination, not endless hours of practice in the search of a medal or a record, but running because its something you love to do. Because its fun to run, because its fun to push your body to see how far it will let you push. And the only goal you set is your own. Just like music, you enjoy it when you start & enjoy it as you gain mastery. You gain mastery because you enjoy it, you practice because you love it, & if you do get certain recognition or commercial benefits, well, that is secondary too. The end goal is engagement & enjoyment - & that's the philosophy of running too, just as much it is the philosophy of music or arts.<br /><br />Secondly, the science. I found the anatomical aspects both interesting & convincing, I enjoyed reading about what the anatomy of running means for running shoes. I can't say if the research behind is exacting, McDougall is no scientist, but to me it made sense. It is when McDougall starts talking evolution that I got a little uncomfortable. It is a brilliant piece to read & its a great argument to show how our bodies are made for distance running - in fact, it almost reads like a detective novel as McDougall sets out to find the evolutionary roots of running - & while the theory & reasoning seemed to make sense, I do not know if McDougall presents enough evidence. Yes, he presents the story of a hunter-gatherer tribe which ran its prey to exhaustion to feed on it, but I do not know if this is representative enough as evidence that links running directly to Darwin's evolution.<br /><br />McDougall writes flowing text with a certain amount of humour. Good story & good research - you should pick it up if you are a runner & even if you enjoy popular philosophy & motivational theories.<br /><br />@souvikstweetss flowing text with a certain amount of humour.

B004SS0884|4.0|Some albums take a couple of listens before you start to like the songs, but when I listened to this one for the first time I instantly liked all the songs.  I was very glad I got the Deluxe Version, although I wish it would have had a couple of remixes, which would have put it over the top.  If you like Britney, get this IMMEDIATELY!!!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|On DroidX running 2.2, most of my music tracks dont player, the player just sits there thinking about playing the tracks...FOREVER. this app needs to undergo some serious testing and improvement. Those are my thoughts.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game is so much fun and I cant stop playing it! I was only a little dissapointed when I got through the 1st 2 scenes and found out I have 2 wait til May 2 continue! It was a little frusterating 2 say the least :-)
B001G136KS|1.0|Unfortunately, I bought this DVD from two sellers. The first seller was from the UK, so I picked the second from North Carolina. Both DVDs are not flagged as being appropriate for Europe, not the USA. The return process works fine. I finally bought the regular DVD version of the movie which is described as being a Region 1 DVD. So, Step Up (#1) is a DVD, Step up (#2) is a Blu-ray, and Step UP 3D is totally awesome. Collect the whole set.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|This one will be a monster smash for the Brit. I can hear just about every track blasting on the dancefloors of the USA and Europe!
B003HOXLE8|4.0|You need to get 3 or 4 books to learn programs.  This is good. (I have only done 1/2 of the first lesson)and you will learn.  The kindle version has a problem. ( I downloaded to my pc as well as the kindle) The \\"clicking\\" back and forth to do the lessons .  The Kindle itself is too small to use as a text book reader,no color....  and besides, it is my wife's reader.  In addition, the Kindle version does not come with the DVD with the bonus 2 hrs. of video lessons. (not sure if it is any good) You can download the lesson images. I ordered the \\"book\\".  In addition, I can resell the book with the Amazon trade-in program.  As of today, 14 for the trade-in, free shipping, in the form of an Amazon gift card. I have a wide 24\\" display and the book was nice to read on it, however, the back and forth was not . If I had 2 displays then it would work.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|This is a fun movie if you just let it roll and don't ask too many hard questions.  There is a pit of the stomach feeling that I haven't felt in awhile - and plenty of opportunities to say \\"don't do that\\" as you talk to your DVD player for no particular reason.  Of course the birth and growth of Dren is the most interesting part and the movie does a good job with that, until the end sequence which seems over the top and completely unnecessary. That being said, I enjoyed the originality and twists of the many sequences presented in this film. Worth a look.
0439796644|5.0|This is a beautifully written and very powerful book. Michael Morpurgo is best known for children's fiction and this is an example of a book meant for children that should be read by all adults.    The author's style is very clear, precise and smooth flowing. In addition to the comments made by other reviewers, there are two points that need to be emphasized.    First of all, it is a very clear indication of the reality behind the qualities in some animals such as dogs- sensitivity and feelings indicating traits such as loyalty. The closeness between human beings and animals, but in particular the dependence of human beings on animals, is described In such a way that it appears to be interaction amongst human beings only.    Secondly, Morpurgo uses the narratives to highlight some stark realities about war we do not see put into words very often. For instance, on pages 75 to 76,        The (German) officer...'You've done a bit of this before,       my friend,' he said.I can tell that. I always knew the       British were mad. Now I know that they use horses such       as you as cart-horses. I am quite sure of it.  That's       what this war is all about, my friend. It's about which       of us is the madder. And clearly you British started       with an advantage. You were mad beforehand.'    Very much worth thinking about!
0756404738|3.0|I have to say I, too, am disappointed with this book. It is not bad, but is definitely not as good as The Name of the Wind.<br /><br />I deeply enjoyed getting to know more about Kvothe's past, but I found the pace of the book extremely slow, specially at the beginning. My major complain is that, even though the book tells us about Kvothe's adventures around the world, not much happened in terms of plot development. Kvothe does not seem any closer to find the Chandrian, his relationship with Denna is as confusing as ever, and we didn't find out anything new about Kvothe's present situation, except that he is a man waiting to die -and we knew as much from Book I-.<br /><br />Having said that, I am waiting for the third installment because my overall impression is that The Wise Man's Fear is just a filler in this saga, and therefore, all major revelations will happen in Book III.
B004IFYN2E|4.0|An elegant and fun ride, with the backdrop of Venice serving as the setting is breathtaking. The two main characters have great chemistry. After a slow start, the film evolves into twists and turns until the very end.  Angelina is drop-dead gorgeous and breathtaking. Highly recommend it for a sophisticated and escapist adventure.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I couldn't believe it when I discovered that my stock calendar couldn't schedule every other week recurring appointments.  So for six months I've been using Gemini calendar, a klunky piece of crap  I thought was the only calendar that had the recurring event options I need.  Then I found Business Calendar.  Thank God, I've finally got a calendar I like.  Buy the paid version right off the bat- there's no way you want do without the drag and drop options.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Well, of course Fruit Ninja is a really good game.  It's a steal for 0.99$ (and it's free now, so there's now excuse to not get it), and it has the best graphics, sound effects, and gameplay of any game I've played.<br /><br />That being said, I'm pretty disappointed that the Android version on both the Android Market and the Amazon Appstore is a couple of updates behind the iOS version.  There are new blades, backgrounds, and multiplayer in the iOS version that the Android version lacks.  Please, Halfbrick, remember that you have customers on both mobile operating systems, and keep us as well updated as the iOS version.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|It's a good techno-geek movie, but it had potential to be great. I am not sure exactly what it was about this but i left feeling slightly like it was missing something. Anyhow...
0439023521|5.0|I'll not say much except that this book is greaat.   I tried to read some reviews before buy it and sucks, because almost all reviews will give you some detail of the book.  I loved reading it, couldn't put it down... All of 3 books. :-)
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This game is fun for a little while but does become boring after an hour of playing. Runs very smoothly on my HTC Desire running gingerbread(2. 3).
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is so so much better with out the ads! Very challenging, makes you think to be able to pass the level. Especially so when you are trying for 3 stars!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Really enjoyed the Movie,arrived right away and in great condition.  Thanks for the excellent service.  Sincerely Ann Pisarek Dutton
B004QSQML8|5.0|Legend has been remastered and is finally coming to Blu-Ray. What you're essentially getting is everything that was on the Ultimate Edition DVD released years back plus a new English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, BDLive, My Scenes and Pocket BLU. That means you will get two versions of the movie: the original theatrical release with the original score by Tangerine Dream and the Director's Cut with and additional 20 minutes of footage and film score by Jerry Goldsmith. Unfortunately it will not have the \\"International Version\\" that people overseas have been able to get on DVD, nor is the original 150 minute work print.<br /><br />Legend is one of the few fairy tale movies not geared toward children. It is also one of the most visually striking, comparable in my opinion only to Del Toro's masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth. Like most fairy tales the story itself is rather simple. Darkness wants to overcome light. The hero wants to save the day and rescue his maiden. There are little subplots like a bit of a love triangle and Darkness trying to seduce the hero's maiden. It's not deep storytelling, but it sets the stage for all the good stuff.<br /><br />And what's so good about it? Well what is Ridley Scott good at (especially in his early career)? A setting that is so immersive and rich in detail that you can get lost in just experiencing this world he created. The forests are magical and have the look and feel of something old and enchanted. The swamps are eerie and desolate and paint the perfect picture of what evil places should look like. The dungeons are foreboding and full of an atmosphere that personifies what Hell could be like. This movie sells the fact it's a fantasy film in spades with just the sets alone.<br /><br />If Legend stopped at sets it would still be a great movie, but Scott didn't stop there. The mystical creatures are just as impressive. Sure the unicorns are just horses with a horn pasted on them. Sure the pixie/elf/gnome like characters look good, but aren't all that incredible. But when you feast your eyes on the gallery of the dark creatures you start seeing some awesome creations. The troll in the swamp is a wickedly done up hag. The goblin Blix is just as creepy looking. Darkness is the absolute best looking devil character you will ever see; hands down. You will not recognize Tim Curry as this seminal character. Then again you won't recognize any of these actors in makeup. Top it all off with an eye for the type of cinematography that maximizes that dream-fantasy feel and you get some amazing results.<br /><br />The acting is also impressive for a fairy tale film. Tom Cruise may look at bit wooden as the hero Jack, but I think it belies the innocence and naive nature of his character. Mia Sara nailed her performance as the very human and naively flawed Lili. Tim Curry absolutely steals the show as Darkness in spite of being hidden behind some impressive and massive prosthetics and makeup. The score for the theatrical release was by Tangerine Dream, which definitely dates that version of the film to the 80's with it's new age feeling synth tracks. Doesn't really fit the medieval setting too much, but it's not totally distracting either. Goldsmith's score on the Director's cut fits much better with the era, but musically is so very bland. As far as soundtracks are concerned it's a toss up, but I have to give a little nudge to Tangerine Dream in spite of it being synthy.<br /><br />This is a single disk release, but it is a BD-50 disk, which should have plenty of room for both movies and all the extras without any compression issues. Visually the movie never looked better. Now the Blu-Ray mentions that the Director's Cut was from an inferior print and won't look as good as the theatrical cut, which had the advantage of a number of good source prints to choose from. If you ask me I don't really see a difference. Both movies stand out in color and details. It's not a night and day difference from the DVD, however itis enough of a stand up difference in clarity to do the double dip. I believe it's just the Director's Cut that is remastered on DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 while the theatrical edit is Dolby Digital 5.1 respectively. As stated before this Blu-Ray release will have all of the original featurettes from the previous DVD release. Here is a breakdown:<br /><br />Commentary by Director Ridley Scott - This is one of his better commentaries and is full of interesting production tidbits. The commentary is on the Director's Cut.<br /><br />Creating a Myth: The Making of Legend - This is an extensive documentary with interviews from major cast and crew members (with the notable exception of Tom Cruise). You hear about the massive sets created, then destroyed by a tragic fire as well as other tidbits on how the movie was made.<br /><br />Lost Scenes - Two scenes are in here. One is an alternate opening scene and the rest are more stills and art composites putting together scenes that I think were never filmed.<br /><br />Isolated music score by Tangerine Dream - Self explanatory. This is on the theatrical release.<br /><br />Trailers, TV Spots and Photo Gallery - All of the promotional materials for the film.<br /><br />In addition to the original features (likely still being presented in standard definition) there are some Blu-Ray exclusives as well. Not in the way of new commentaries or documentaries, but more or less the application type features. Here is the breakdown of those:<br /><br />BDLive - There is potential that alternate or scenes previously deleted may show up in the future via BDLive. Same goes for additional interviews and features. In my experience, however, is that this feature is sorely underutilized.<br /><br />My Scenes - This lets you bookmark scenes that you can share with other registered users with Universal Studios.<br /><br />Pocket Blu - I think this is another feature used in some Blu-Rays from Universal. You can use your iPad or iPhone as a remote as well as other neat features like bonus contend, soundtrack lists and posting options.<br /><br />All in all if you are a fan of fantasy films this should be on the top of your list. It is a little known classic of that genre. If you have the original DVD release it is still recommended to snatch this up as the remastering really does update the visuals in a big way, plus uncompressed HD audio is also welcome. If you never got this movie now is the time to do it. The likelihood of another edition coming out similar to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner that includes the work print and new features is unlikely as this film never really garnered nearly as much attention. In other words this is likely the best we will get.
B004E547D8|5.0|I'm a fan of mindless action films, provided of course that they make some little amount of sense. This one does. I like Bruce Willis films and this one fits right in. Lots of action, good, if somewhat iffy, romantic angle, and Helen Mirren with large caliber guns is a hoot. Not a chick flick.  I liked it enough to buy the disc, even though I had already rented it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|[[ASIN:B001AQO3QA Alien Anthology [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />I hate buying Blu-Ray Discs (BD) before I have seen them, especially with these VHS > DVD > BD conversions. But my wife loves these movies, so I did a some research and hoped for the best. Got lucky, the greatest difference was Alien and Aliens. More movie, better sound and music, and for Alien, wow! You can see details that you never saw before, the lighting is way, way better.<br /><br />I have a 7.2 surround sound system capable of reproducing all known codecs to include DDTRUEHD and DTS-HDMA and a 50 inch plasma.  This was the best showing of Alien and Aliens that I have ever seen to include the first time I watched Alien in the theater.<br /><br />Alien 3 and Alien 4 were equally good in quality but I wanted the first 2 movies more.<br /><br />The extra's are great and I love that you can put one BD in right after the other with no B.S. warnings or piracy crap.<br /><br />Excellent purchase.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Love that the cloud concept is finally coming to media! Simple interface and lots of storage with the 25 gb deal. I highly recommend over iTunes or Zune
B004RJMUJO|1.0|As title says, it needs to be patched to work on the Droid X. It's much too laggy to play. Looks like a fun game though.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is a brilliant re-think of Sherlock Holmes. Moffat has kept the true feel of the stories, while updating it to the modern era. His talent with story and dialogue shows through here, making it funny, but still action packed (like Dr. Who). I enjoy both characters very much, who also keep true to the stories. I cannot wait to see more.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I really thought Amazon would have put more thought into launching an app store to compete with the Android Market. Getting exclusivity and then geographically restricting downloads is not going to help the launch.

B004FRX0MY|5.0|I've been using this app since my HTC Hero days. On my Evo its the only music app I use to find and download my songs quickly. I really like the fact that you can buy songs and instantly save to the cloud giving you an instant backup should anything was to go wrong.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this game. It runs like butter on my Droid X. Beautiful graphics with a lot of variety. This is a definite must buy even though I got it for free.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|With femme fatale. there is technically no slow songs. just a up tempo cd. I find that great. FEMME FATALE is the Britney with Light. Circus is the britney in the middle. and BLACKOUT is in the dark
0061733199|4.0|Well written and easy to follow.  I have been camping many times, but this puts things in a different perspective. Might be a life saver if you throw this in your BOB (but go ahead and read it first).  I would pair this with a better reference book on plants to eat(with pics) and you should be set for any SHTF situation.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|Maybe the review title sounds like a pan, and I guess it is, but as much as I was absolutely enchanted by \\"The Name of the Wind\\", Rothfuss's followup \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" left me tired and ultimately frustrated, and yet all the while I couldn't put it down. Many have spoken about how 1000 pages of story barely advanced anything in the grand scheme of things, and it's a sound argument. As pointed out by another review I read, WMF feels like Act 1: Part 2 rather then Act 2 of 3. It's a ***, maybe a *** 1/2 whereas the first one was a full *****.    *** SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON ***    My main problem was that every time it felt like the story was advancing and evolving in an organic way, Rothfuss slammed the breaks on the plot and sent Kvothe off in another disappointing direction. The transition from the University to the Maer's palace was fine enough, if you don't mind several chapters worth of plot excised (the shipwreck, pirates, etc.) I can see why it was removed -- anything to move the story along, right? We needed to get Kvothe to Vintas. OK, cool. And everything in that section of the book, the palace intrigue, political maneuvering, Kvothe's cunning and observation really felt like it was pushing Kvothe towards a new chapter in his life. And it was. And just as things got interesting and were leading towards a culmination of several hundred pages worth of plotting... Rothfuss decides to send Kvothe out on an elongated, drawn-out bandit hunt.    I felt the air draining from the novel's lungs. So now we have to start a whole new plotline just when things were getting REALLY good in Vintas. The Bandit Hunt. Great. What was the overall purpose? To introduce Kvothe to Tempi AND to show a brief glimpse of a Chandrian (who makes a hasty exit to no last impact). OK well several seemingly endless pages later, everything's wrapped up and we can get right back to Vintas, right?    Nope. He sees Feleurian one night (out of the blue), runs off after her, and the plot is sidelined AGAIN for a hundred pages of Kvothe: SEX GOD! He can't lose his virginity in a human way that reflects his growth into manhood, he has to pursue and subdue an anotherworldly Fae sex goddess who teaches him some combination of the Kama Sutra and the Malaysian Pile Driver that makes him the master cocksman of the universe. Oh and he gets a cloak and some plot exposition from a powerful talking tree. Can we get this over with please?    So now he comes back and he's banging half the universe, but OK, **NOW** the plot can start getting interesting again? Nope, Tempi's in trouble for teaching the Ketan and Lethani, so now he's going to run off and defend him in Admere. For the love of God, we don't have THAT many pages left in the book and we're off on another tangent. But it's OK because now not only is Kvothe a 16-year-old Sex God, he ends up being the only barbarian admitted to the world's baddest martial arts order as well. But as long as he ends up learning something from it, right?    Wrong. He goes back to the University and he's back EXACTLY where he was before, still headstrong, still angry, only now this time he has money. And the book ends.    I haven't mentioned Denna at all until now. Because the fine, mysterious, intriguing character from the first book became an annoying, obnoxious, forgettable buzzkill in this book. Every time she showed up -- magically, wherever Kvothe seemed to be -- she was the literally equivalent of 17-car pileup in a deep fog. The dynamic of their relationship never changed, and the sum change in their relationship from book to book is nonexistent.    And yet, for all the problems I had with the plot -- and there were many -- it was the details, the universe, the sense of wonder, the dialog, the humor, Rothfuss's prosaic writing style... it was the little things that I loved most. Overall I didn't think too much of the book. Taken on its own, it was fine. It just didn't seem to add up to much in the end, and the narrative kept tripping over itself so much that it never was able to maintain any momentum after the first half of the book or so. Disappointing.

B001TODCII|4.0|I was passing through the living room and this movie was playing on HBO. It grabbed my attention and I rewound it and watched it on the spot. Liam Neeson is a compelling actor. He plays a father whose daughter has been taken and he needs to use his special skills to recover her in the next few days before he loses her forever. Though there are many killings in this movie they are for the most part quick and impersonal. (I rented Kingdom of Heaven shortly after and Liam Neeson was great in that as well in a similar type role of sacrificing all for his son).
B000002VMD|3.0|i thought this was the special edition that included two remixes, one was \\"Queen of the Night\\" the other was \\"I'm everywoman\\".
B0008ENIAC|4.0|I just want add before you read the rest of my review that I did not buy it on Amazon but I wish I had because the other online store charged me way too much.    Now lets get to the point Mildred Pierce the original version starring Jone Crawford is a great film there's just something about classics like these that's timeless and just plane fun to watch. the DVD is great because it contains a 60 minute autobiography about the film star which include interviews with her adopted daughter and others that knew her, and of course the film is wonderful, so if you love old classics get this one I'm happy I now have it in my collection its a keeper.
B002ZG976U|5.0|OK, lets be open and honest at the start here. If you do not enjoy watching dancers, especially Burlesque dancers, this may be a hard to view movie. This is not for you if you cringe when lingerie appears on the screen.<br /><br />If on the otherhand you are not offended ny this the movie will quickly move from a 1 to a solid 3-4 for you. If you enjoy such themes and enjoy dance I think you will give it a 5. If you enjoyed queen of the Moulin Rouge ,Pracilla Queen of the Desert, Mama Mia, and Black Swan this is a must watch. Although there is a lot of fantastic music (just picked up the soundtrack) it is not a musical, but a wonderful story.<br /><br />Its a fun story, there are seductive view, it deals with relationships that shape lives.
B00005JLPK|5.0|What if...you had a father that loved you completely and exactly as you were, nurtured and promoted that person, and accepted her unconditionally? Though many writeups on this movie focus on the tragedies of Frida Kahlo faced and their impact on her art and life, I was much more intrigued by her seeming to by-pass that adolescent stage where societal pressures lead to the constraining, binding, and denying a girl's spirit and masculinity. The way her art work was weaved into the film sometimes with still fades and sometimes with animation was awesome.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I found Evernote through the Android marketplace, installed it on my Samsung Epic and my laptop. Love the ability to sync between devices, and access through the cloud. I use the app extensively to track notes on projects, to do lists, and more at work. Evernote also has a great plug-in for Outlook, so you can upload your e-mails to Evernote from within Outlook.     I used Evernote extensively while planning a recent trip, then had the notes on my phone to refer to while I was gone. Even saved me $60 when I went to pick up my car from off-airport parking - I had lost my paper receipt showing I had prepaid, but was able to show the attendant my receipt through Evernote, and that served as proof of payment.     Love this app!
0316098337|5.0|This is a book that stays with you a long time. It is the haunting tale of Jack and his Ma, who has created a world for her five year old son. A world that is so hard to imagine. She has taught Jack that he is loved and he loves his life, even though it is so limited. Jack thrives and lets us see the world through his eyes. The eyes of a wonderful child who life has dealt a tough hand. Jack and Ma will be characters you will remember and think about for a quite a while. I loved this book!
0439023491|5.0|Be sure to read book one first, not that you couldn't follow the second without it but the read will obviously be much deeper and rewarding, I think.<br /><br />I think that if you like captivating reads this is one for you. What an adventure here in this triology! I am 39 and love this series. I am woirking through these with my daughter. She was 8 when we started and is now 9 as we read a few chapters a week. She also loves it. Perhaps it is not for all 9 year olds - but I am quite open with her, she does not have any ill effects to the books themes and brutality (more so in book 1: unless we have just got used to it now).<br /><br />Can't say much that overrides almost 800 4 and 5 star ratings (most at 5). The 1 stars are minimal and are essentially outliers, thus; ignore them. Statistically speaking you will will enjoy this, and if not you can have something to discuss as per what the mainstream and status quo tend to enjoy. That would certainly be an interesting reflection for you.
0679736646|5.0|Life has three different stages: life and death, plus a stage in between where people can be stored without losing mental functions and, through the service of a company that maintains the body in this \\"half life\\", there is a chance to comunicate.<br /><br />With this scenario, the author builds a novel that has mistery, thrilling elements, corporate interests and also funny situations. All of this are combined  so that the reader enjoys a book with a plot that could be difficult to understand.<br /><br />Although the book was written over 40 years ago, you will enjoy several elements of our XXI century life such as interaction with machines that talk to you and charge you for basics such as eating, taking a shower or checking out from the hotel). \\"No pay, no shampoo\\".<br /><br />Also, full access to information at anytime. In the novel everything becomes relative and this information can be manipulated so that you take wrong decisions.<br /><br />Third element presented in the story is body transportation, that can take you from NY to Zurich almost automatically, but I guess we have not arrived to that stage yet.<br /><br />What's the \\"Ubik\\"? You need to read the book, and I warn the reader: You will be challenged at every page. Good thing is you will not stop reading.<br /><br />I enjoyed very much this novel, my first Philip Dick reading. Although his books were written half a century ago, I am  looking forward to reading more from him. Excellent science fiction.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while. At first, I was hesitant, since I'm not really a fan of sci-fi books. However, after a few chapters, I was completely wrapped up in this post-apocolyptic society. Not just a book for teens. Adults can enjoy this just as much as younger people. The parallels drawn between this fictional world and the current state of our nation is completly relevant and thought-provoking. A must-read. Both Catching Fire and Mockingjay are also outstanding!
0670022411|5.0|I loved this book!  Where other books have left me cold or dissapointed when they are toted to be the Happy Potter for adults, or Twilight for adults, this book delivered and I can not wait for the next in the series to come out!
B002ZG98FU|4.0|What a great movie, very funny and an enjoyable view indeed. Loved the way Harrison Ford played his Indiana like character in the coldest of ways, thought he did well. Although it could have used a scene of two more with the team building deeper rapport - it is not a bad view at all. Great fun to be had and many laughs.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my husband, and he loves it, not just because of the quality of the turntable itself, but because of the software that came with it, which he considers the best for audio editing and much easier to use than Audacity.

B003GEDLW6|5.0|I found out about Pendulum through DJ Hero 2.  I heard the Pendulum downloadable pack, and had to have it.  Needless to say, it was a wise choice.  It's a fusion of all Electronic genres, which sounds like a gimmicky failure on paper, but Pendulum most definitely pulled it off.  House you favorite genre?  Check out \\"Salt in the Wounds\\".  Drum and Bass?  Peep \\"Watercolour\\".  How about dubstep?  \\"Set Me On Fire\\".  Trip Hop?  You'll probably like them all.  Metal?  Check out \\"Self vs Self\\" feat. In Flames!  What an awesome fusion of genres this CD is, great work Pendulum.
B001D8W7CW|1.0|This has to be the worst blu ray I've ever purchased. The quality of the transfer is terrible. Muddy picture, and lackluster color too. My copy of Carrie in the dvd format has a better picture. Do not purchase this blu ray. Wait until Brian DePalma wakes up and supervises a real transfer.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|Think its a great movie, a true story of survival and worth the watch for this alone. If you do like these kinds of adventure survival movies be sure to watch (if you have not: Touching the Void and Into the Wild). I have included links below.<br /><br />Some found it slow, and perhaps it is, but I enjoy such movies that let you think and contemplate as you watch. I feel not all movies need to be running at the pace that the 21st century is. You can feel the essence of time as I think this is one of the goals. This movie, I feel, should NOT be a fast paced movie - so it fits the bill perfectly for me.<br /><br />Great work<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00020X94W Touching the Void]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000ZN802W Into the Wild]]
0670022411|5.0|Dare I say that this book is better than twilight.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE twilight--I'm a fan.  I have to say though that A Discovery of Witches is a teeny bit better!  The characters, and storyline are rich and well-developed.  Lots of magic and fantasy.  Maybe I just like the fact that it's geared more toward adults.  I cannot wait for the next book-- it's keeping me in suspense!
0307463745|4.0|A lot of junk passes as good to great books for developing highly effective habits in a blink without going over the tipping point, this book cuts through the bull and presents straight-forward and unconventional ways of doing business.

B0042816YK|4.0|If you like Julia Roberts this is a movie you should not miss, she does a great job. I enjoyed this a lot. I think that something was missing - and am not 100% sure what is was, but being fair it also appears that mant others have a similar view.<br /><br />I do recommend this as it is a non-typical movie, thus; very welcome.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|The movie is great.  I like having the four disc pack so I can use it in my computer to project on the wall at my house or watch on the blu-ray player at my bf's place.  Definitely would recommend it.  Having it on my computer/ipod is cool too.  In case there is a part or line I want to show someone ... I have it with me.  (I have the Up 4-disc set also and it's great).
B004G6009U|5.0|Can you name the only three Bluray titles released in Dolby DTS 7.1 Master audio?  Two have Pixar connections.    Both released late in 2010  1. Toy Story 3  2. Step Up    3. Tangled    Wow!  Thanks to John Lasseter and the Pixar sound team.  Another disc I can use to exercise my full surround system.  All other Bluray titles are 5.1.  Your stereo will digitally process the 5.1 into 7.1, 9.1, 7.2, etc.  Only these three have 7.1 built in.    What a fantastic musical film by the way.  A new Disney princess of the highest rank in my book.  The 3D is stunning.  I imagine if you were on a lot of hallucinating compounds the disc title (with hundreds of floating lighted balloon bags floating in front of your face would be worth the price of a 3D TV..)
B002ZG983M|4.0|Didn't expect much when I saw this. Thought it was going to be another lightly amusing movie in which a bunch of kids acting all crazy and stupid. But to my surprise, there is actually a decent and somewhat unconventional story, and serious amount of fighting and ass kicking. Some of the main characters, though may be goofy and crazy, are quite likable. Overall, very refreshing and enjoyable experience.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|It is about a ballerina, but about so much more. A triller. A drama. A touch of the unforbidden. A touch of a troubled upbringing. I have watched this and have discussed this movie with others and we all found is so captivating in many ways - but it would not be for all. I usually let my daugher watch almost anything, I am quite liberal, but would not let this one get through - no way!! But for a mature audience, slightly aged, great. Non dancers and non ballet fans will also enjoy this. It is simply a captivating movie.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|[Disclaimer: I did not purchase my copies from Amazon, as HMV in the UK and Newbury Comics here in the U.S. were offering special preorders with booklets autographed by the band. Sorry Amazon.]    I've been a fan of Within Temptation for almost 10 years now, long before they ever released any material here in the United States. Many don't realize, but WT started as a \\"gothic\\" metal band, replete with death vocals (gutteral growling male vocals usually found in death/black metal). The band WT spun out of the Dutch band \\"Voyage\\", under which name they released one CD entitled \\"Embrace\\".    Since Within Temptation's debut \\"Enter\\" back in 1997, the band's sound has been progressing lighter, but always retaining rich orchestration. This new album is probably the most accessible and \\"radio friendly\\" material they have ever released. While the strings and orchestration are still present, they take a bit of a back seat and the band's sound on this album is more guitar-driven, with the songs less epic/progressive in structure.    All that said, while WT purists might object, I personally find the new album eminently listenable and enjoyable, especially the track \\"Iron\\" which is an absolute monster. The chorus is a huge payoff and overall the song is over the top.
B004SS0884|5.0|I'm a Britney fan, and while I abhor her terrible live 'performances' where she half-heartedly sways back and forth, moves her mouth to the words (when she remembers) and generally just wanders around the stage marking her dance moves, this cd makes me remember why I'm a fan.  The lyrics aren't deep, the singing isn't 100% legit, but the hooks are plentiful and catchy, and just plain fun to listen to.  There are a couple songs I don't really care for, but many that deserve a listen.  My favs:<br /><br />Inside Out<br />I Wanna Go<br />How I Roll<br />Big Fat Bass<br />(Drop dead) Beautiful<br />Gasoline<br />Up N' Down<br />He About to Lose Me<br /><br />I loved Blackout, and this album is closer to that than 'Circus', so it's definitely on my go-to list.  Bonus - these songs are GREAT for running!<br /><br />I still love you, Britney!  Please get your personality and on-stage spark back!!!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|ordered this for my nephew to start his Disney collection, I have always enjoyed the movie; shipped as it was available!
B004L3AR0K|5.0|First of all lets consider the theme here, and then decide if you will like it. There are 2 camps here and if you don't chuckle at the thought of a good looking guy making a living off selling Viagra the movie is probably not for you. On the other hand if this gets you laughing - its brilliant.<br /><br />I must add that the movie is much more. It goes beyond this into a deep caring relationship - and even if the former is not your tea the ending and character transformations should turn you around. Brilliant movie.
1416972250|4.0|After finishing City of Glass, I finally understand why these books are best-selling.  The first two books were average, with just enough to keep me interested but nothing special.  This volume knocked it out of the ballpark.  The main characters become fully developed and the plot kicks into high gear with nearly non-stop action. Book two ended on a cliffhanger with someone telling Clary how to wake her mother.  This book picks up immediately from there with everyone traveling to the fabled Alicante.  The last Mortal Instrument is here, and Valentine will come for it.  I was very happy to see the other characters (Luke, Alec, Magnus, et al) get fully involved in the story, as well as their relationships solidifying along with Jace and Clary's.<br /><br />The book wasn't perfect.  There are still more than a few info dumps, and the \\"forbidden love\\" between Jace and Clary dragged on way to long before being resolved. Still, the good significantly outweighed the bad. The mythology of Shadowhunters is expanded upon.  Valentine's plot is more convoluted than previously hinted at and our heroes actually formulate plans in response to it, rather than just reacting to individual incidents.  I especially loved that Valentine's downfall was so perfectly executed (the how and the who).  Though the conclusion is very satisfying, there are just a few threads left with potential for more books. Overall, this trilogy was well worth reading and I look forward to the forthcoming [[ASIN:1442403543 City of Fallen Angels (Mortal Instruments, Book 4)]], and the spin-off series \\"Infernal Devices.\\"
B000002HH9|1.0|There are no redeeming qualities to this album at all. The opener, Want, is not a bad song, but you've forgotten about it after track 4.  Total crap.  This is The Cure (namely Robert Smith) trying to prove to the world that he doesnt only write depressing stuff.  But when he writes this crap, it's more depressing than their darkest material.  Total garbage.  I am a major fan of this band and this is the first album of theirs I refused to buy.  Nothing they have done since is worth listening to.  This album was the death knell for The Cure as everyone knew and liked them...no matter which previous album got you into them.
1408215330|5.0|This Dictionary is excellent for foreign English speakers, as it helps in choosing the correct words when their meanings are close and by noting which are the most common ones. Besides, it brings both British and American pronunciation and usage of words. I recommend it.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Even though I didn't care for Blackout, I really liked Circus. So, I was excited for this new album because many early reviews said it was mostly dance music.  Britney has a few ballads that were good, but I think her talent is best used on upbeat, fast tracks.  Happily, that's what we have here and I enjoyed the majority of 16 songs on the deluxe edition (a rare feat these days).  And those four extra tracks are worth getting the deluxe CD for.  Yes, some of the lyrics are a little silly (with sexy panting and cooing) and a few tracks are \\"overproduced\\" with unnecessary techno riffs.  Overall though, the songs are very catchy - the kind you find yourself singing or tapping along to.  The style is a lot like Lady Gaga actually, and easily as good.  And great for dance clubs - I expect some amazing remixes will come out of this album.<br /><br />For me the standout tracks are: Hold It Against Me, (Drop Dead) Beautiful and, ironically enough, Big Fat Bass.  The song is ridiculous, but I just can't get it out of my head.  The beat is amazing, with a catchy hook, and Britney's voice is strong and even.  Plus, Will.i.am is actually a good match.  Some other notables are gasoline and selfish.  And the last track is a surprisingly good rock song; a nice change for her.  I will listen to this album again and again.  Highly recommended to Britney fans, and pop music fans.

B004FRX0MY|2.0|This came pre-installed on my HTC EVO 4G and I don't use it or want it. The problem is that it can't be uninstalled. Amazon, its not cool to pay phone companies to front your products and force them on us. I love your other apps but this is ridiculous. All this app is doing is taking memory on my phone.

B004SBX112|5.0|Angry Birds has to be the best cell phone game out there (its even more amazing on the iPad). Seasons is no exception. I've had the free version from the Android market ever since there was only Christmas and Halloween on there. Then I bought the add free version on Amazon appstore and it just saved over my free version. I couldn't be happier with this game. Also, I've noticed the Rio advertisement when you restart a level but its hardly noticeable so I don't see the beef some people are having with it. Overall great game! Worth every penny of the $.99!

B000002KDG|4.0|I was never a big fan of Neil Young, and not much of a fan of live music.<br /><br />Then on my 16th birthday, my best friend gave me this album, when I peeled the gift wrap off and stared at the cover I said; \\"Who's Neil Young\\"? My friend was kind enough not to punch me. I was joking, of course I knew who Neil Young was, but while I would occasionally refrain from changing the station when his high pitched voice broke into \\"Old man\\" or \\"Ohio\\", I really was not a fan.<br /><br />But I knew my friend had good taste, so I gave the album a serious listen...<br /><br />Wow, I could not have been more of an idiot, this was pure gold.<br /><br />Without delving into the content and my own perceptions, I will simply state, that the sound of this album, the range, from acoustic to distorted guitars, is mesmerizing. The music first appealed to me from the pure amazing sound and eventually I came to enjoy Neils songwriting, social satire and dry wit.<br /><br />I learned to be more open minded, though I wasn't a huge fan of Neil Young before, I now have a great respect for his talent. And I listen to more live music now too.
B002VECLVO|3.0|there was more \\"movie\\" in this film. Tom Ford (a director-amateur and a designer-professional) shot something between movie and tv ad. Having such talented stars on board (excellent Collin Firth and slightly irritating Julianne Moore) could have ended up as one of the best gay theme pictures ever.<br />But the final product is disappointing.<br />In my opinion Ford tried TOO MUCH to be \\"an artist\\" instead of focusing on direction. Some plots stays unclear - for example the one with the second dog (apparently it was exported to another matrix after the accident).<br />Some parts of the movie are there just to...God knows why. Example? The very \\"artistic\\" scene in the water. It is nice, but that's it. It didn't allow me to understand the plot better.<br />As well as all details (his car, his clothes, his house etc.) I couldn't resist the feeling that it was more important to the director to show precisely  and nicely all the poshy things than to shoot a proper film.<br /><br />To sum up - worth to watch (not to buy), but it is not a masterpiece as you could expect.

B000GPIPSS|5.0|When I think of Dracula, there are two images in my mind. The first one is of BramStoker's literature classic \\"Dracula\\" and the second one is the 1931 Dracula movie. Many actors have played the role of Count Dracula but the image of Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi as Dracula is a striking one, he defined the image of the vampire many of us have with his voice, charm and looks. After all he IS the original Dracula and in my opinion does the best representation of the role; he accurately transfers the character to the screen. The first attempt at a Dracula film was the 1922 German Expressionist film Nosferatu (another masterpiece, the two are very different) but legal problems with Stoker's widow changed this.<br /><br />Originally Lugosi's beliefs made it difficult for him to accept the role of Count Dracula This film made of actor Bela Lugosi a legend, Lugosi played some interesting roles afterwards and proved to be a very talented actor in such films as the independent White Zombie (1932), Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), The Black Cat (1934) and The Raven (1935). In case you are wondering he could play much more than Dracula (and if you like his performance here you should definitely watch some of his other works). Lugosi had such a powerful presence as the count and it's hard to forget the classic lines he delivered such as \\"I never drink...Wine!\\"Dwight Frye is excellent as Renfield, delivering a fantastic performance full of emotion and all the actors were truly excellent in their respective roles.<br /><br />Speaking of the DVD itself now, you have the option of also playing the film with Phillip Glass'1999 soundtrack, and the 75th Anniversary edition also has the Spanish Dracula. Personally I prefer the film without the soundtrack, as it was originally but it is nice to have that option. The Spanish version of Dracula (with different actors and all) is obviously not as good as the English one but it has its own charm and is interesting to see. There are other extras such as posters, galleries and a documentary. I'm not sure sound-wise quality but I think the 75th Anniversary edition has probably the best image and visual quality out of all the DVD editions available.<br /><br />Regardless of which edition you buy, the 1931 Dracula is a classic and enchanting cinematic experience that should be experienced by those fascinated with the one we call \\"Dracula\\". The DVD, however is a little expensive but looks very neat with the cool case and it does have some extras. 5 stars for the movie itself, I'm not sure what fans expected with this 75th Anniversary edition but I love the movie even if some more extras would have been welcomed.ters, galleries and a documentary.

B004RJMUJO|3.0|I found the app to be quite boring. The whole premise of the game is to slice fruit as they bounce on to your screen by dragging your finger across. The problem is that's all the game is about. You have to keep cutting the fruit as more and more come onto the screen. While in classic mode you have to \\"dodge\\" bombs that come onto the screen with the fruit. Also if you fail to cut three fruits in this mode its game over. The other mode zen is continuously throws fruit onto the screen. And arcade you are time limited.      So the question that comes up is how many times will you \\"slice\\" the fruit before the game is repetitive and boring. The game tries to lure you into playing it more by looping in achievements and sword color unlocks through various combos and counters of fruit you have cut. The game lacks depth. And all it comes down to is do you like to test your reflexes (while remembering to do only one task- dragging your finger across the screen) and see a plethora of colors come onto the screen.     There is no character movement or stages with puzzles to move through. Its fun the first five minutes and then its the same thing over and over again. Its like the flash games that were way back when you moved your mouse to drag some icon across the screen.

B004SRU0M4|4.0|This album is what I expected. If you are looking to hear the \\"underground mix tape\\"  your not going to that on Rolling papers. This is his 1st main stream album he is trying to appeal to the masses. As your avg music listener of pop, hip-hop, rap, r&b, and reggae... I like this album. There are songs on here that I play on repeat, while there are other tracks that I listen once and keep it moving... overall it is a good album. I will purchase the next one.... Taylor Game!
0756405890|2.0|I bought this book strictly on the strong praise it received from the Amazon reviewers.  I really wish they hadn't let me down.  A lot of people had said they were impressed by how this novel was different from the typical fantasy novel, it was realistic, and the characters were very well written.  I just don't understand it at all.  The ONLY character that is really given any detail is Kvothe, and the whole novel is his self-centered depiction of his difficult teenage years.  Someone *might* recommend this book to teenage girls looking to get their feet wet in the fantasy genre.  The love story is something sickly sweet out of Twilight, but without any of the fulfillment.  I know even gifted teenagers are prone to foolish adventures, but how can you not pull your hair out in frustration reading how stupidly irresponsible Kvothe is with money?  Imagine a teenager today who is $6,000 in debt to a loan shark, who then decides to borrow $20,000 (offering to help criminals break into his school library as collateral) so that he can lease a Ferrari for one day to follow up on a rumor he overheard at a bar. This is our \\"hero\\" Kvothe.  Oh, and by amazing coincidence the girl he's in love with (but is too scared to do anything about) happens to be waiting for him there. The whole book is contrived to squeeze out the maximum amount of soap opera style drama from a contrived storyline.  I will say that Rothfuss's dialogue and depiction of Kvothe's music are entertaining and certainly the highlights of the book, but overall I am very surprised this novel appealed to as many people as it did.

B0034U27PE|5.0|Life of Pi has to be the best book I have read in several years. It was a beautifully written tale of a young man from India's efforts to survive in the face of incredible odds after the sinking of a cargo ship carrying his family over the Pacific Ocean. Life of Pi primarily covers Pi's battle to beat death while sharing a lifeboat with animals that also survived the sinking of the cargo ship: a Royal Bengal Tiger, an Orangutan, Zebra and Hyena. Pi's amazing story takes a surprising twist at the end as he tries to make sense of what has happened to him on his journey. I definitely will be passing this book onto others.
0758232225|3.0|This novel by Vanessa Davis Griggs is primarily about a young woman named Melissa who goes out, against her first inclination, with a guy who sometimes visits her office. To her surprise however, she has a great time with him and becomes really interested. The problem however is that homeboy aka Marcus is divorced and Melissa isn't down with that, since her understanding of the scriptures sees being involved with a divorced person as committing adultery. Luckily for her Marcus is not about to let her slip away without a fight, and he takes the time to work through the divorce thing with her, showing her how she may have interpreted the scripture wrong. I'm glad to see them working it out and all, but three-quarter way through the book, when the baby momma drama begins to ensue, I can't help but wonder if there is something to be said about not being involved with divorcees. It sure does present the challenges involved, and I like that Griggs keeps it realistic like that. I must say though, I was a bit annoyed that Marcus could not seeing what his crazy baby momma was up to.<br /><br />My only problem with this book is that, as I read it, I knew there was some back story that I was missing out. There were a lot of details at some parts and I would think \\"she's not just telling us all this for nothing, it must connect to something else somewhere else.\\" Then I found out that most of Griggs previous books are connected to each other, and this one was no different. In some cases the story felt very cluttered with all of these side plots and other stories. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the book. Furthermore, the cliff-hanger type ending has me looking for Goodness and Mercy, Griggs next book in the series.
B004SRNH10|5.0|Adobe Air has a ridiculous amount of functions that are also really useful on your computer.  It's really a must if you use your droid a lot...
B004RJMUJO|3.0|The concept is to use the touchscreen to slice fruit.  On the iPhone it works great,  however, on the Droid X the game is unplayable because of the lag.   Even with the game being free, I would avoid it for Android.     The problem is that the fruit flies on the screen, you swipe it, the fruit falls and nothing happens. It even takes forever to get through the menus.    EDIT: Okay, I accidently let my battery drain one day and after it recharged again, the game played without any problems at all.  Not sure what the problem was, however, some have indicated that it is a resource hog.  I have upgraded the score of this app from 1 star to 3 because while the game plays like it is supposed to now, I just did not find it more than an average game.  I felt like it was boring.
1591843790|5.0|When I first got my preview copy of \\"Enchantment\\", I didn't know what to expect.  I don't really know that much about Guy, and I haven't read any of his other books (sorry Guy).  I knew he was a big deal on Twitter and that he was the guy (no pun intended) behind Alltop.com, but that was about it.    In other words, I started \\"Enchantment\\" with zero expectations.  I only tell you that so you'll understand that what I'm about to say isn't colored by my being a long-time Guy Kawasaki fanboy.    Now that we understand each other, let me just say this: whatever you're doing, stop now for as long as it takes to buy this book.  Yes, it's that good.    Guy has distilled the art of getting people to support your cause down to simple, manageable steps.  Whether it's a business, a charity, a product or an idea, enchantment is the art of rallying not just support but commitment from those you lead or those in the trenches with you.  In Guy's own words, \\"if you need to enchant people, you're doing something meaningful. If you're doing something meaningful, you need enchantment.\\"    What's the difference between enchantment and more traditional methods of persuasion? Simple: rather than feeling like they've been manipulated to do what you want them to,  enchanted people feel the same level of devotion to the cause that you do.  In other words, enchantment is how you get others to see your vision, to share it and help you bring it to fruition.    But don't take my word for it: go. Get yourself a copy.  Once you've read it, you'll see exactly what I mean.    The world needs more enchanters right now; shouldn't you be one of them?
B002ZG9774|5.0|This movie was stunning! Christina Aguilera and Cher did great in it. The dancing, music and love story were great. Christina's character was likeable and you could relate to her. The The movie was never boring, it was entertaining from beginning to end. Best movie I've watched in awhile, it put me in a good mood, and this movie just didn't disappoint. I am so glad I bought this on blu-ray and actually bummed I didn't have a chance to see it in theatres. It doesn't even compare it to the last dancing musical Nine which was a disappointment.  This movie is too thumbs way up!
B001MBK3T4|5.0|I have to admit it. This is the best Black Sabbath Album. I mean, what can I say. They friggin' nailed it. Slipping Away is a little weak, but the rest of the album is so epic, its jaw dropping.
B004G6009K|4.0|Since this movie just came out supporting 3D in the 4 disc package I bought it to be the first full length 3D movie I would try on my new 73\\" Mitsubishi TV. Bottom line-Disney knows how to do 3D. For me I felt like I was looking through a window at the action. Good colors and done well. They do not need to report to many of the overdone cheesy effects that are often tried in lesser material. Good action scenes, story and it is a quality piece of work. Adding all the discs to this package plus the digital copy makes it a great value. Many will use the DVD in the car or on kids players, and it allows those with 3D TV to experience that as well. If you dont have the 3D yet, you watch the Blue Ray regular version. And you have an extra copy for the laptop, IPAD or I touch device.
B00005R62N|5.0|This album was my introduction to Judas Priest, and I always prefered these versions of these original 9 songs. Its easy to understand why 6 of the 9 original cuts were concert stapples before their first album was release, but due to the Producers, those 6 wound up on the second and third albums. 2 of the 9, were from the latest album, so that is why the performances are so tight, yet earthy as in live with the slightest slop. The stadium ambience is quite noticeable as well.<br /><br />Any wise engineer would use some sort of top of the line unidirectional instrument mics for drums, bass and guitars. I think so many live albums stink because they record the audience, and seriously, who wants their noise interupting the band, which is live jazz albums tend to be better. Kids aren't screaming through the whole songs.<br /><br />This album is so good, its the only one other than the Essential Judas Priest, that I own, along with about 8 downloaded songs. So I'm not a Priest fan to the point of being a collector. Its got a great cover, as all official Priest albums do, but this is the only one with the band dispayed, the rest have album art.<br /><br />So what is the deal if this isn't a studio album. Well, of any mics to cause an issue its the vocal, so when the vocal tracks were found damaged or unusable, which happens as it once happened to me. The singer had to re-sing the songs, most likely during a pre show sound check, which sounds like a nightmare scenario, but Rob pulled it off. Hence all the tension of a live performance, and probably one takes over two or three days between shows on the road. Also the benefits of not having too much audience noise.<br /><br />I started listening to Priest because of this album, so I recomend it as a starting point for some. With songs like Tyrant, Exciter, Ripper, Victim of Changes and Green Manalishi, how can you go wrong. My complaint, they recorded \\"Take on the World\\" and \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\" on this tour. Two of my favs, so this is a 4.5 on the re-issue bonus track edition. I wish they were here. This is the Les Binks era drummer wise, so thats a big deal.he re-issue bonus track edition. I wish they were here. This is the Les Binks era drummer wise, so thats a big deal.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|A lot has been said about the album in other reviews, and I agree with most of the positive things said about it.    I didn't pay Britney Spears much attention until I heard Blackout many years after I first heard it. I had a casual interest in her earlier music, but my interest didn't last that long. When I first heard \\"Blackout\\", I dismissed her as having gone off the rails.    But, for some reason, I gave \\"Blackout\\" a listen a couple of years later on and started to really appreciate it -- moreso after repeated listens.    \\"Circus\\" was a return to pre-Blackout days in some ways and a progression in others. \\"Femme Fatale\\" is like a blend of the most electronically-adventurous tracks of \\"Circus\\" (i.e. Amnesia, Phonography, etc) with most of \\"Blackout\\".    As with \\"Blackout\\", this album first sounded monotonous on first listen. More repeated listens allow the tracks to take on their own identities.    Nightmare situation, though: there wasn't just one song that stuck in my head after listening a few times, but about six of them; and I couldn't predict which one was going to invade my thoughts next :)    The engineering on this one is top-notch. It sounds equally great on earbuds as it does on a large sound system. Obviously, the large system kicks a whole lot more, but it sounds good on both types of system.    There were some excellent tracks in the bonus tracks that came with deluxe versions of \\"Circus\\", so I took the chance here and was pleasantly surprised. \\"Up N Down\\", in particular, is up there with the best of the tracks on this album. I usually don't buy Deluxe versions, but this is one to get!    Forget all the people who say Britney can't sing and doesn't write her own songs, etc. Singer-songwriters have their place, and great singers often make boring music. \\"Femme Fatale\\" is great pop music. Does it matter if Britney is a model to show off some of today's most talented pop creators' creations? Not to me!    I'm giving it 4 stars because there are a few songs I don't like -- \\"Criminal\\" is one.
0394721780|5.0|This is the ultimate must have cookbook in a cooks library.  So many of the dishes I serve have started with the classic basics that I learned from Julia and have evolved, so when I am asked for a recipe I hand them my \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" to take home as a gift.  The first thing I do the next day is order a new book for me!
B004H83IG4|1.0|This film had high expectations given the cast Gosling, Dunst, and Langella, but the story, some of the editing, and the utter lack of explaining or atleast a fictional theory of an explanation of what the director or the writer thought that happened at some key plot points were almost non existant. Maybe they wanted to leave a lot to the imagination, but the last 30-40 minutes of the film could have been cut down quite a bit.     People just seem to pop in and out and some of them don't even have names.  Like I stated before the acting was great, but as far as character development, which is what a film like this needs was non-existant. You need to care what happens to the characters in order to want to watch the movie.     In my opinion the director knew this and just put a random nonsense nude shower scene of gosling and dunst just to make someone waste a few bucks to see some cheap thrills.  This is the only reason to even instant watch this movie if netflix even desides to aquire it.
0439882826|5.0|This was one of the best buys I made here! The poping up system and the moves associated in some of the figures is awesome! Amazing!
B0049P1ZZQ|3.0|As far as the show goes it's a slow roll pretty much each episode, the first disc is amazing on blu ray. It looks wonderful, the acting is great, and the special effects are amazing.      However this is where the \\"PRODUCT\\" part comes in, this is SO not worth the price as there are only 5 episodes and the lackluster behind the scenes stuff was somewhat interesting.  Having never seen the show, but heard so much about it, I was sorely disappointed after watching all the content.    I've read some of the comics and really looked forward to this especially since Greg Nicotero was doing the EFX, but 40 bucks is a stretch...20 maybe....maybe if you are a fan.
0385341679|5.0|What an awesome, fitting, perfect ending to a series that is truly \\"out of this world\\":)  I finished this one this afternoon and I'm still reeling from the intensity and the punch that this book packs.  To describe this book as a \\"roller coaster ride\\" simply would not do it justice.  This book had me on the edge of my seat, neglecting all basic needs (eating, sleeping, ect.), and guessing, second guessing, and third guessing myself until the very end.  It was brilliant.<br /><br />I would just like to say Thank God that KMM respects her fans enough to give Barrons and Mac their due \\"moment\\".  I have been waiting for that moment for the past 4 books and when it comes....it is so worth the wait.  KMM takes her time developing the relationship and the pay off is perfection.  I loved those chapters and will be re-reading them often:)<br /><br />The emotion, surprises, and lasting impact of this final installment of the Fever series will leave me satisfied (and a little exhausted) for some time.  I have the new BDB sitting on my night stand, but for the first time, I can't even start it....I'm still not ready to say goodbye to Barrons, Mac, or the Fever series yet.  Anything that has the power to keep me from the BDB is a force to be reckoned with.  I can not recommend this series more highly!
B003FXXNBW|4.0|If you enjoy old school american karate films like Bloodsport, Kickboxer, or Best of the Best check this film and Undisputed 2 out.  Liking the two sequals in a series is unheard of, with that said STAY AWAY from Undisputed 1.  Just pick up part 2 and 3 and all the head-kicking-bone-breaking-blood-spewing action in these films should satisfy every mans man.     This film was especially enjoyable because they brought back a character that in part 2 was a VERY charismatic villian, so much in the 3rd movie they make him an anti-hero of sorts. It also brings back a few characters from the previous one that stood out and they have bigger parts.  The action is amped up in this as well from the previous installment.     If you like martial arts movies this one is right up there.    BOYKA LIVES!!!!!

Loud and clear in this book.<br /><br />We are well-protected by unbending American men who meet the bad guys on their own turf.<br /><br />Thank you, Marcus Luttrell, for telling your story in a way that is inspirational to other brave young men.  I hope the example your service makes will bring others to that grim determination to succeed in SEAL or special forces training.<br /><br />This book doesn't use a lot of jargon -- it is easier for civilians to read than \\"House to House\\" by David Bellavia.  It has an immediacy, and the brotherhood of the SEAL team comes through loud and clear.<br /><br />The first chapters, on the training regimen for SEAL-wannabes, went on a bit long.  But as the book went into the firefight, it became easier to understand the conditioning these men had undergone, and how that enabled them to absorb what they did and keep on fighting.<br /><br />Heartbreaking, heartwarming book.

0525951652|5.0|First off, please stop punishing Ken Follett and this terrific novel because you don't like the pricing. It's not his fault. If you don't want to buy it at the current price, wait for it to go down or get it from a library.  That being said, this is a terrific book that makes me want to read the next two books. I was very caught up in the story and had to remind myself that I was also learning a lot about the early 20th century. For a long time I was worried that Pillars of the Earth was an aberration and that Mr. Follett would never reach that level of writing again. He has proven me wrong with this book.
B002SQ364Q|2.0|The director certainly tries his best to capture the feeling of the Woodstock phenomenon / festival from a periphery. The film is well shot. However, the script examines the phenomenon through the lens of a money-driven family and major events through their son who is coming to grips with a whole bunch of non-Woodstock related events. Homosexuality, interpersonal relationships, career etc.  ZZZZZZZZZZZZ.  Personally, I could care less what this uninspired actor/comic does.  Liev Schreiber is one of the few actors in the film who keeps you from turning off the whole thing.  In short - there was nothing of Woodstock in there to hang your floppy hat on. No sequences of musicians, no staged behind-the-scene sequences. Nothing, other than a drug-induced scene in a van where there is some Woodstock music played against a dreamscape of LSD inspired visions.  Slap in some nudity, some tie-dye, some eccentric people and call it movie.
0316789704|5.0|After having grown up myself, flipping thru the Ed Emberley books, I was really excited to introduce the series to my own children.  The steps are straightforward and easy for small children to understand.  Upon receiving the book, I chose a simple picture of a little girl with curly hair, from the first page, to draw for my daughter, so that she could understand the symbols and how they were added step by step to create the pictures.  One example seemed to be all it took for my 5 year old to become hooked on this method of drawing!  Riley and her \\"Faces\\" book have become practically inseparable, and I've noticed that all of her drawings now include the little details of realistic facial expressions.  The grandparents love her homemade cards and the school teachers find her art skills \\"advanced\\" for a 5 year old.  Its a great resource for non-artistic parents too, that want to add charming doodles to boring brown paper lunch bags, or thank you notes for friends.  I can't wait to purchase more!
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Of all the Star Trek series, Next Generation is my favorite. To have all 7 seasons on DVD is a treat for any TNG fan. Not only every episode, but extra features as well! I was so excited when it arrived, I immediately sat down and popped the first DVD into the player! Haven't had the chance to finish watching the rest of the set, yet-but I'm working on it!
B003Y5H54W|2.0|The reason I give this movie two stars is because it was over the top with the violence. Someone getting killed every 10/20 minutes. That was very tiring. It was good though because the ending was a complete surprise for the audience. I like Amanda Seyfried, but she disappointed me in this movie. The plot line was interesting but the way Catherine Hardewick directed it, made it not great.

B002ZG99N6|4.0|In 'The Town,' Ben Affleck proves that 'Gone Baby Gone' wasn't a fluke.  He's a top-notch director.  A couple of years back, he suffered from comparisons to erstwhile equal Matt Damon.  Damon seemed to pick all the right projects ([[ASIN:B001F12J0C The Bourne Trilogy (The Bourne Identity   The Bourne Supremacy   The Bourne Ultimatum)]] foremost), while Affleck picked dreadful ones (typified by 'Gigli').  Quietly, he started picking better roles and - more importantly - controlling his own destiny.  His presence is in every corner of The Town: screenplay adapter, director, co-star and pseudo-casting agent (he's responsible for many of the Boston authentics that dot both his films).<br /><br />It's an excellent film, expertly told.  As a director, Affleck has staged some small, thrilling scenes.  Most notable: a light, casual lunch between Affleck's character and Rebecca Hall's character which suddenly turns taut and mesmerizing when Affleck's buddy (and co-conspirator) Jeremy Renner unexpectedly shows up.<br /><br />In [[ASIN:B001DJ7PR8 Vicky Cristina Barcelona]], everyone talked Cruz, Johansson, Bardem, but it was Rebecca Hall whose performance made that film.  She was incredible.  That happens again here.  You have to believe both her fear (and its after-effects) after the initial robbery and her willingness to be smitten soon after by Affleck's character.  She's the single best thing in the movie.<br /><br />As an actor, Affleck excels, too.  He plays a criminal with a soft heart, albeit well-hidden.  Hall's character sees this side of him, meaning she's got quite a shock coming when the movie's two plotlines intersect.  Affleck has the inherent sensitivity to pull off this dichotomy.  Think if the roles were reversed: could Jeremy Renner do that?  Not with half as much conviction as Ben Affleck.
1416550550|5.0|The Forgotten Garden is a beautifully written book about the search for identity that entwines generations of loss.  The changing time periods enhance the central themes of the book as characters find objects in one chapter, and the events surrounding the artifacts unfold in the next.  The fairy tales interspersed throughout the story magnify the magical quality of the Victorian motifs.  Answers to mysteries are teased out throughout the book, and the conclusion is satisfying as small details introduced in 1900 become relevant in 2005.  This is an enchanting book with rewards for the reader who discovers it.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|In this game, you get to experience the fun and excitement of being a ninja! Except, you are in training, so instead of slashing dudes you get to slash fruit.    The gameplay couldn't be simpler. Fruit flies up into the air, and you slash it. But be careful, there are also bombs that show up from time to time. Bombs? What kind of grocery store is the sensei shopping at. Anyway, they can reduce your score or end your game, so don't slash those! At the end of each game you are rewarded with a \\"fun\\" fact about fruit. So, if you like fruit facts, there's an incentive to keep playing.    There are three modes. In classic, you just keep playing until you run out of lives or slash a bomb. In the arcade mode, there is a time limit, but if you miss a fruit or slash a bomb you don't lose lives or have your game end. Zen mode is like arcade, but there are no bombs and you get more time to play.    Graphics are nice, and the game has leaderboards and achievements through Feint. You can also unlock different swords and backgrounds, which is pretty cool I guess.    Not at all bad for a casual game to quickly pick up and play. But the gameplay is very repetitive and I suspect most people will get bored fast.
0452287022|5.0|This classic work of art shines in the readers eye.  The multi-layered story of a maid hired by the famous painter lingers in memory.    The realistic portrait of 15th century life illustrates the human condition:  chance, fate, tragedy, social norms, power, pettiness, economic necessity, cold relations, disappointments, abuse, greed and expectations shape this teen's experience.    Yet, there is hope, depth and a luminous quality to her experience as a maid and artist's model.  Though semi-literate, this \\"girl\\" grows, yearns, observes and understands her life and the lives around her.  She leverages her limited assets to live a fulfilling life and become wise.  Mostly, she learns to \\"see\\".  Life, people, objects, paint, work, relations, history and culture have many things to share once they are understood.  The intense focus on the daily life and growth of someone just 16-17 years old reflects an everyman experience.  Those are the days we remember most intensely, when we were learning and growing every day, beyond what we knew.    A maid, like every person, is priceless.  After reading this moving work, you'll agree.

0399250573|5.0|The 4th September 2000 was a very important day for children's books, and more particularly for boy-friendly fiction. That day saw the publication of Stormbreaker, the very first outing for Alex Rider, Anthony Horowitz's reluctant teen spy, and now more than a decade later the ninth and final book of the series is released today. I personally believe that the impact that this series has had on children's publishing is immeasurable, not only due to its own success, but also the plethora of similarly themed stories that have been published (and continue to be published) since. I personally know many boys who have been turned on to reading by the Alex Rider series, and I am sure that teachers and librarians around the country have had very similar experiences.    It really doesn't seem like ten years since we were introduced to Alex, yet even though a decade has passed for us, the time period covered by the series is much shorter - not much more than a year, in fact. In Scorpia Rising Alex is now 15, and he hasn't heard from MI6 in five months, giving him the opportunity to settle into the life a normal teenager should be living, concentrating on his first year of GCSEs, being made captain of the school football team, and even finding himself being given the part of Teen Angel in the school's production of Grease. With every silver lining, there is usually some kind of dark cloud in tow - in this case Alex's long time carer and closest friend, Jack Starbright is getting itchy feet. She rarely sees Alex any more as he has now managed to build a healthy social life with friends his own age, she questions whether he needs her any more, and there is some pressure for her to return to the USA where her father is quite ill. Anthony Horowitz has made it very clear that this will be the final Alex Rider book, and this starts to become quite clear as we read these early scenes between Alex and Jack - time and events have changed them both and now it is possibly time to move on.I say 'early scenes', but this is a little misleading - we don't actually get to read any kind of scene featuring Alex until page 129! Sounds a little crazy that we don't get to see our hero until almost a third of the book has past, but therein I feel lies the cleverness in Mr Horowitz's writing, and also helps make this book the best in the series so far. Those first 128 pages are devoted entirely to Alex's enemies, following them as they devise a scheme that will net Scorpia a fortune, whilst at the same time enabling them to destroy the teenage boy that has been a thorn in their side for so long. In order to assist them in their dastardly plan they enlist the help of another of Alex's enemies, a character we first met much earlier in the series - and no, I'm not going to say who it is, or even which book it was in, as that would just spoil the surprise for you. All I will say is that this person hates Alex more than life itself and will do everything within his/her power to destroy him. By devoting this much time to the set-up, Mr Horowitz created in me an ever-growing nervous tension, as I started to wonder just how Alex would survive this final mission.     This tension was heightened by the fact that Mr Horowitz had previously stated that a character that had been in all of the previous eight books would die in Scorpia Rising. A little knowledge can be very painful - every time a key character seemed in jeopardy I found my heart beginning to race, fearing that this would be the moment I had to say goodbye to an old friend..... and then somehow that person would survive, my heart rate would return to normal, only to accelerate again a little later. The author does this to us several times, making the scene where a character dies even more hard-hitting, and also very much emotional. I read a large portion of Scorpia Rising whilst on a train heading into London to listen to Mr Horowitz give a lecture for the National Literacy Trust, and as I read this sceneI am not ashamed to admit that I had tears in my eyes. I very much doubt that I will be the only Alex Rider fan who sheds a tear at this point in the story. I told Mr Horowitz as much when I had the chance to talk to him, and I got the impression that he had found it an emotional scene to write.    As well as the changing relationship between Alex and Jack, there are many other elements throughout Scorpia Rising that indicate that this will be the concluding episode of the series, long before we get to the final chapters. Before Alex even appears in the book we are told that Alan Blunt will soon no loner be in his senior MI6 position. Somewhat topically, a new prime minister is in power and has decided to shake up the intelligence services, and his discovery that MI6 has been using a teenager on missions was the final nail in Blunt's professional coffin. However, with the end of his career in sight will Blunt worry about the consequences of using Alex one more time or will he finally see sense? Can he possibly stoop any lower than has has before? Another popular MI6 character throughout the series has been the jocular gadget inventor, Smithers. Yet again he is able to lend Alex a hand with a useful 'toy' when he finds himself having to go to Cairo, and for the first time in the series we actually get to see a little more of Smithers as he goes out into the 'field'. This leads on to an incredible revelation about the portly technical wizard, and also the unveiling of his greatest ever invention.     We have seen a lot happen to Alex over the course of the series, and he has matured faster than any teen of his age should, but in Scorpia Rising we see him have to cope with the violent death of someone he knows, and the gamut of emotions he experiences following this - numbness; pain; anger; hunger for revenge... we really do see his raw emotion and with this comes a fatalism that we haven't witnessed before in Alex. In the past it was all about survival - by the end ofthis book it seems he doesn't care whether he survives or not!    I really do think that this is my favourite book of the whole series - it has all the best elements of the previous eight including the tight plotting, the twists and turns, the great action scenes, totally evil villains.... you name it, Scorpia Rising has it. However, I am sure that there will be fans out there who do not share this opinion. The expectation felt by fans before reading the final book in a popular long-running series is always pretty extreme, and may will have their own ideas of how they want the series to finish. I expect you will read a number of reviews as glowing as mine, and probably an similar number of negative reviews with fans complaining about one issue or another. I would suggest you read the book for yourself and make your own mind up, and whatever your feelings about Scorpia Rising then join me in thanking Anthony Horowitz for the thrills and excitement he has brought us over the past ten years, and will no doubt continue to bring us in the future with the continuation of his fab Power of Five series, and the Alex Rider spin-off book he plans to write, with the story based upon how Yassen Gregorovich became an assassin. Thank you Mr Horowitz!
B000002UJQ|3.0|In all honesty, Radiohead strikes me as a band that placed too much attention to production techniques as opposed to actual music. Average people are too often being mesmerized by the special effects of OK Computer, but if you were to remove these computer-generated sound effects, you'd see that there's really not much to the album. The album opens with Air Bag. It starts with a computer-processed guitar droning made to sound \\"futuristic\\" in a cliché sort of way, but it ends up being a good song though. It then proceeds into Paranoid Android; probably the masterpiece of the whole album, with the exception of a few flaws. The \\"Rain down on me\\" ending segment of the song is touching, but it sounds a little conceited. Subterranean Homesick Alien is probably my favorite of the album. Its fascinating, with its lightstorm display of sounds, it really captures that desire in all of us to be taken away from this boring world we live in, and explore extraordinary areas of the universe light-years away from here. But even still, it's all studio trickery. If you were to disregard how distorted the sound is and examine the melodic structure of the song, you'd see there's almost nothing to it. Radiohead always emphasized the effect of the sound over musical content. With the mournful Exit Music, we find Radiohead burying its nails deep into our subconscious. Anybody who has had a bastard father that they couldn't bare to live with can relate to this song. Let Down was a nice song, with its influence of The Byrds' jangle pop. However, the segment of computerized bleeps, bloops, and blops just sounds embarrassing to me. Karma Police has a very strong melodic piano progression, even if it is sort of a rip-off of Sexy Satie. This ends up being the last good song on the album, it's all downhill after this. After listening to songs like Electioneering or No Surprises, you're left wondering what the hell happened to this album. Similar to the album Ten by Pearl Jam: the first half ofthe album is great, but the second half is rather unsubstantial. In fairness, Ok Computer is a decent album. Even if it was, for the most part, a showcase of computer-generated effects; an emphasis on the emotional effect of sound instead of musical quality, it's at least worth checking out. I still enjoy listening to it every now and then. But there are far more significant albums coming out of the 90's, such as Loveless by My Bloody Valentine, Spiderland by Slint, and Well Oiled by Hash Jar Tempo. I'd consider those albums to be the essential masterpieces of that decade and were created by artists who are much more deserving of the word \\"innovative\\" than Radiohead was.

B004BLJQOK|4.0|Writer-director Matt Reeves's (Cloverfield) slick version of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel \\"Let The Right One In\\", and the earlier Swedish film adaptation by Tomas Alfredson, is not bad at all. While it lacks some of the subtleties of the Alfredson version, it certainly is a disturbing and genuinely creepy take on Lindqvist's tale of a bullied young boy and the childlike vampire-girl who moves in next door. It even manages (like the original film) to create some pathos for the undead lass and her awful fate. \\"Let Me In\\" is certainly worthy of your time and would even make a great double bill with the original Swedish version - if you feel adventurous.
