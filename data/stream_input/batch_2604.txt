B008AK8FHM|5.0|A mind boggling book. Much of what it has described is already stated in ancient Hindu scriptures. For example, he used Om synonymous for God. This very word is the essence of God in Hindu philosophy. In fact most Hindus chant Om to invoke God. The concept of soul (Atman) which is eternal, indestructible and undergoes cycles of birth, death and rebirth is beautifully and comprehensively stated in Gita by Lord Krishna. I recommend reading of Gita to all those who are interested in comparing Dr Alexander's experiences with the ancient Hindu philosophy; for the fact that what he has experienced is in conformity with the texts created thousands of years earlier only adds to the authenticity of his experiences.

B004XWLN20|5.0|I loved the Smallville series. I followed it from day one all the way to the end on the WB which later became the CW. I purchased this item as a Gold Box one day only deal for a GREAT price! Just a few days before I had found all seasons of Smallville for sale at Walmart for $14.97 a piece but when I got in my email on the day of purchase, I found an Amazon email for Smallville: The complete series at 60% off the list price. I decided to follow the link just to see what the price was exactly. Turns out, it was about $38 less than I had spent at Walmart just days before. It seemed a no brainer to me. I ordered right away and returned the 10 Seasons I had previously purchased to Walmart the same day. The item arrived much sooner than expected which was perfectly alright! Thanks AGAIN Amazon for keeping me a happy customer!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This is one of the best written, best acted movies I have ever seen with an important subject matter.  Excellent film.
B004AKCME8|3.0|My son is a huge fan of the book series. The first time I saw the movie, I liked it, but now that I've seen it 100 times, Soren's voice is so whiny and he sounds like he's on the brink of crying in every other scene. But my 9 year old likes it so its good for kids
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading!!!  It was a great book! ! ! I'm going to read the next two also! Wow

B003WUYOQ6|3.0|This book was recommended to me to read by my heart doctor.  It has good information in it, however, it is not an easy read.  A lot of time is spent de-bunking previously accepted nutritional standards.  The book sites a lot of scientific studies.  The information is good and I believe it is important to read......maybe skip the first four chapters.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Just wanted to have one for the occasional use.  It seems to work well and is easy to input fractions.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I read this while (mostly) walking on the treadmill over a week.  It was so good I didn't mind exercising longer.  The story across generations is heartwarming and it was a great intro to the Orphan Train - first I'd heard of it.  I have recommended this book to friends' book clubs.

B00BW5K5DO|3.0|The game is beautiful and addicting but the free version only lets you play two islands which is seven levels. This kept me occupied for an hour and another half hour beating my scores. Wouldn't buy it cuz I'm cheap but it's a great game. Would give it five stars if it were free...
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I chose this app thinking I could take pictures with my Kindle and see them better since they'd be on a larger screen.  But this app has the camera pointing at you!  How do you turn this thing around so you can take pictures like you do on a regular camera or on my iPhone!!!  Very frustrating.  Glad it was only 99 cents.

B002N2LEVM|5.0|I enjoyed this series very much. Josh Whedon hit it out of the park! At times however it almost seemed to get a little predictable ( especially after the first ten episodes or so) but then it would floor you with a new hook. However the show seemed to resolve the stress-suspense ( I really get exhausted with a series when it goes straight from stress to stress without a compensatory rest. Like on the case of 24,after all that is why I am watching the mind numbing tv in the first place:). I was a huge fan of Firefly so I watched Dollhouse out of name recognition for Whedon, However this show can by far stand on its own merit in my humble opinion.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|It has always been my understanding that a book is supposed to have a beginning, middle, and end.  Unfortunately Entwined in You seems to be missing an end, and debatably, it doesn't have much of a middle either, but it does have a beginning.  It nailed that.  Entwined opens right where Reflected left off.  Eva and Gideon are trying to rebuild the trust between them, while maintaining the impression that they are still broken up.  This is great stuff - Lots of angst, lots of stolen kisses.  I loved it.  I was at the edge of my seat, hoping and praying Gideon and Eva would pull through the bad times.<br /><br />Here are the things that made me loose interest in the book:<br /><br />Eva's attitude and actions.  She's hanging out with her ex, and going to clubs and grinding on guys, while supposedly trying to make it work with Gideon.  I wanted him to kick her to the curb.  It's what I would have done.  The respectful, responsible, and kind hearted Eva I grew to love in the first two books is apparently on vacation, and replaced with a wild party girl look alike.<br /><br />The sex - there was just too much of it.  I know, I know.  We read these books because we enjoy the smut, but there's such a thing as too much of a good thing, and this book has it.  I found myself growing increasingly bored, and skimming a lot.<br /><br />Then there's the complete and utter lack of action in the book.  In previous books, there was an actual story behind all of the smut.  This novel starts with relationship stress, but that's the only problem the book works to solve.  It's just a lot of sex, and unnecessary relationship drama (thanks to Eva acting like a boy-crazy 18 year old party girl).  Absolutely nothing happens.  Nothing gets resolved.  I'm not even sure the characters grow much.<br /><br />When I read Bared to You, it was insta-love for me.  Reflected was a harder read, but I forgave that, because it was dealing with difficult topics.  The book 2 breakup plotline is always painful and heart rending.  Unfortunately I think Entwined suffers because the author chose to take a trilogy, and stretch it into a longer series.  There wasn't enough material in the original outline to accommodate the increase in books, so what we got was a whole lot of nothing in this book.  I'm assuming all the exciting bits she planned for the end of her series, will show up in the next book. At least I hope that's the case, because I'm not sure I can wade through another book that bored me as much as this one.nful and heart rending.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|We started watching the first season on Netflix because we'd heard so many good things about it.  Then we were hooked and came over to Amazon to watch the rest.  This season was free for me since I'm a prime member (season 3 was not).  Great writing, acting, interesting way of life.  I highly recommend Downton Abbey!
B001TW68P4|5.0|I saw the Turtles last year on the Happy Together Tour and will be going again this year.  I follow Howard Kaylan on Twitter & he actually recommended this one to me (and was spot on!).  It's got ALL the greatest hits (original recordings, digitally remastered) and they sound great!  Can't go wrong with this one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We started watching the first season on Netflix because we'd heard so many good things about it.  Then we were hooked and came over to Amazon to watch the rest.

0307277887|5.0|Well, so much has been said of both this Dexter and Showtime's interpretation.  Frankly, this book is the closest those two Dexters ever get to one another, in my opinion.  The book is a beautiful portrayal of a charismatic, witty, serial killer with a budding heart.  Obsessed with the moon, driven by a darkest of needs, and determined to utilize this need for good, Dexter is one of the most enthralling heroes in literature.  He is, frankly, a hero we need in society today, thus the great appeal of both the books and the show.<br /><br />His narration is always entertaining, though I do feel like I am missing out on description and setting.  But, to be fair, First Person will do that.  Otherwise, this book is enthralling and worth a read.  Especially if you are a fan of the show.  This is Dexter's first home, in literature, in print.  He was born here, so this is the most authentic Dexter you will get.<br /><br />Not better than the show.  Just different.  That's all I can say without ruining the experience.  The show veers away from the subsequent books, which take on a creepy almost supernatural bent.  In fact, you might want to start reading the books to experience a VERY different Aster and Cody!  LOL.  You'll cringe and love it.<br /><br />Read it.  Then read the next books in the series.  Or I'm telling Dexter.

B00571F26Y|2.0|I think this author had good intentions. Though I was not convinced that eliminating wheat all together forever will be the solution to sustaining a healthy weight. Quick weight loss, sure. I personally think the diet is highly restrictive.If you have Celiac disease (which God bless you if you do) or suspect you have a gluten sensitivity, try reading The South Beach Diet Gluten Solution by Arthur Agatston, MD. His argument was more credible to me as he did not present his findings as the &#34;be all end all&#34; in the gluten solution. He admits that doctors are still trying to figure all this out to due to the innumerate availability and affordability of foods containing refined products, preservatives and additives. Good tips on eating on the road at the end too. I don't recommend &#34;wheat Belly&#34;.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm hooked! Can hardly wait for Season 4! These actors and actresses have so brought Downton Abbey to life -- and kept it there, now, in Season 3 -- each segment being as good as the one before it -- all weaving a great fabric of a stirring story well, well told. Plus: was there ever a setting better than the Abbey itself, with its great cedars of Lebanon trees on its lawns,  to the national treasures in the form of art on the walls, starting with that huge portrait of George I? This season continues that rare feast for the eyes - including those wonderful costumes so very well designed to fit in with the times depicted -- and the dialogue, of course, just sparkles with dry English wit (and a good deal of American sensibility thrown in for seasoning, too.) &#34;Well done!&#34; as Churchill might well have said, &#34;Well worth the go!&#34; Obviously, I also had to buy it. Its a series you can't watch just once!
B005LJITS0|2.0|The story just jumps around without too much plot development. The character interaction is not believable because the acting from Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively did not mesh well.

B00DF0POXA|1.0|It's funny how people are calling this album a classic and all sorts. Kanye got the media and critics scared of him, so anything he releases will get rave reviews.  I am sure if Kanye farts on a track, i am sure it will still sound good. I am afraid of what Watch The Throne 2 will sound like if Jay lets him have his way.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Sadly, I will not be anxiously waiting for the next book like I did this. What a buzzkill of a book. I give this book three stars because it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. There were so many chances to end this book on a good note, but nope, it kept going and going and going. The ending didn't give you anything either. It just ended.<br /><br />I know I won't be paying to read another book in this series, I'll wait until it hits the library.
1609611543|5.0|This is a landmark book--we'll look back in a few decades and realize that this was the beginning of how we beat obesity, heart disease and other debilitating diseases.  I also am a fan of Jonathan Bailor's book \\"The Smarter Science of Slim\\".  I'm a 55 year old male, and when I started my new eating lifestyle, I was about 230 lbs (I'm 6'-1\\".) I have cut out virtually all grains from my diet (corn, wheat, rice) as well as potatoes.  Now when I look at food I think to myself 'is this grain based food' and if it is I just don't eat it.  I enjoy many types of food in a balanced approach to eating--about 1/3 carbs from non-starchy vegetables and fruits; 1/3 protein and 1/3 fat.  I also drink a lot of green tea and water (probably could do better in that category).<br /><br />Anyway, I started eating this way (and exercising differently using eccentric resistant methods) in January and 6 months later I have shed about 20 lbs of fat and have improved my muscle tone. Also, I have had arthritis in my shoulder for several years, making it painful to play golf, lift things, etc.  That pain has completely disappeared--it went away after about 5 months of the program.  I have also had significant back problems in the past, and now my lower back has never felt better.

1781162646|5.0|***I'm giving this a 4.5, but for ultimately minor reasons I will explain below***<br /><br />Hard Case Crime markets itself as the purveyor of classic pulpy crime fiction. King's first venture with them, The Colorado Kid, wasn't his best work, but I was excited for Joyland nonetheless. I expected something a bit more like the cover indicated. Something thrilling and sexy and scary and maybe a little bloody too.<br /><br />This story was none of those things. While I want to be disappointed about this, I can't really be, because it was so well-written and had such a great ending, and because it had so much damn heart that not liking it would be like kicking a puppy.<br /><br />It's a coming-of-age tale about a Boy Scout of a guy named Devin Jones, who had his heart broken by his first love and goes off to work at Joyland, a small amusement park in North Carolina. There he makes some friends, discovers he likes entertaining kids while wearing the park mascot suit, and ultimately becomes bonded to a dying little boy and his mother. He also has a slightly harrowing experience involving a serial killer mystery and the lingering ghost of a victim, but all that is way way way in the background, which to me pretty much removes it from the genre altogether.<br /><br />King refuses to be hurried along by the plot here. He hints at darker things to come throughout, but it isn't until the last third of the book that it really kicks into high gear. There were times when I wondered whether it would actually all pay off in the end, but it did. And when the waterworks kicked in on the second-to-last page, I knew the story did its job well. While this still doesn't QUITE hold the emotional heft of King's other coming of age stories (namely his masterpiece \\"The Body\\") it was told in much the same spirit (with a little kiss of his 11/22/63 character development thrown in) and it has all of King's usual keen awareness of the human heart and his flair for pure storytelling.<br /><br />So no, Joyland is not the kind of story the cover would have you expect. It's actually something more than that. Hopefully it will surprise you as pleasantly as it surprised me.So no, Joyland is not the kind of story the cover would have you expect.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. I'd recommend this book to my friends any day.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|I'll try not to give the plot away but my overall opinion is that this is a mediocre rental at best.  I had high hopes for this movie as I'm a fan of post apocalyptic movies and futuristic movies.  Adding Will Smith's good acting to the mix had me thinking this was a sure hit.  Unfortunately-the movie follows his son Jaden Smith, whose acting skills are less than stellar.  Will Smith does start out in the movie with a majority of the scenes but 15 minutes into the film and his exposure is cut to a him communicating with his son through basically a wrist walkie talkie.  He is not involved in any of the action sequences in the movie and Jaden Smith's acting skills are not developed enough to carry a movie in my opinion. I can only assume he was cast in this movie as a favor to his father.  Will's performance as a strict futuristic military type father is just ok as his character is supposed to come across as a very strict-almost unfeeling father and yet it's just stiff acting at best.  And again-Jaden Smith's acting is just not all that good in my opinion.  He just lacks believability to me but he's young and I have hopes he'll master the trade as his father did.<br /><br />While there are a few \\"creatures\\" in the movie-so much more could have been done with the premise of this movie yet the focus was generally on Jaden Smith's character rather than diving into the evolving of creatures on this planet.  If you are looking for a movie with a lot of action and sci-fi special effects-there are a few but this film falls short of what they could have done with this storyline.  If you're looking for a film with a deep meaning intertwined with the plot-this is not it.  If you're expecting another great film showcasing Will Smith's impressive range for acting-this is not it.<br /><br />What you'll get is a movie starring Jaden Smith and a few shots of Will Smith as he speaks to his son through the radio communication device (so you hear his voice a lot).  It's not an awful movie but not the best and definitely not worthy of box office prices.  At best this is a rental-but keep in mind that you will watch this and realize there were better rentals available.<br /><br />Just for reference-I'm not a picky reviewer and like a lot of films that seem to get bad reviews.  I also still enjoy films with stellar special effects even if the acting isn't the best.  This movie just doesn't have that for me.  I think watching 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, Battleship,  or John Carter is time better spent.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|i like this version very good 5 star EASY TO STUDY  easy to read i can take it with me any where i go. even read it in church .  and study at home.
0316153907|5.0|I think I like Michael Connelly&#34;s books about as much as any of the other writers of the same genre. I thought I had read almost all of his books, but ordered The Last Coyote as the title did not seem familiar. It was an earlier Harry Bosch novel I hadn't read and iIwas reminded of how much I liked Connelly&#34;s style of storytelling. Great story line and great character studies. Harry is such a human character, with flaws and the ability to do good things. A great read. I ordered the next two books in order immediately after I finished!
B002NPUCF8|5.0|Great music, great sense of humour! Steel Panther is a not a serious band, and that why there guys are so fun. But be aware, it's not onlyfun, the music is awesome!
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Cole really stepped it up on this album. From his wordplay to the message he's continuing to show why his fanbase is so dedicated.
B000TXNDUW|1.0|First of all, jump cuts. What's the big deal? I won't waste your time with a detailed negative review. But I do want to mention two or three things: 1) The 26 minute scene between Seberg and Belmondo had me rolling my eyes with boredom.  2) Hearing the glaring Iowa accent of Seberg as she speaks French put me over the edge.  3) Godard apparently abandoned the screenplay,  which is annoyingly obvious. Here's something positive that I will say: There are so many other French films that are so much better and are exciting to watch.  For instance, \\"Confidentially Yours,\\" \\"The Piano Player\\" and \\"Les Diaboliques\\" are just a few that I would recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|AMAZING! Love this app and will be my favorite for a long time. You can build awesome structures, mine for diamonds, and share with your friends. It's really fun!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved the book. Read it before seeing the movie and even though they are different I loved them both. Gripping read.
B004GYY714|5.0|I remember the days sitting in my bedroom with my short wave radio trying to pick up anything from somewhere far away. How things have changed. While I do miss the excitement of the old short wave experience, internet radio is also a treasure trove of discovery.<br />This app is a great way to allow you explore.
B004HD61KE|4.0|This was a good read, although I thought it a bit slow starting.  Once it gets going, as is usual for Rollins, the action and suspense just don't quit. I'm already waiting for his newest addition to the Sigma Force collection.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I like what this books says, and how its said. The author himself admits this information has been around for awhile, but presents it in a compelling manner, along with updated information. I found my hunger reduced just by following a limited version of the diet suggested.
B00AW57L96|5.0|This is the first of Liane Moriarty's novels that I have read and from the moment I started to read it I just couldn't put it down. I felt the characters to be believable but it was the plot that grabbed me right from the beginning.<br />The book is funny, sad, exciting and really hard to put down! I found myself really scrutinising the characters and putting myself in their position. It is a great look at how we deal with huge secrets in our lives and the difference between right and wrong.<br />I highly recommend this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is amazing!! i love it! im soo glad that they made a pocket edition! i do have questions though... when can we play with herobrine? when is the next update? and while ur working on it can u add that we can herd animals with wheat? and add pumkins to make golems!
B009NY43NY|3.0|An ok read. I could tell the author was ready to end this series and move on to other stories.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|I enjoyed the film. A simple film with no dramatic twists but a good movie to watch and relax with loved ones.
1577314808|1.0|This won't take long, which is what the author of this repetitious, pretentious, pompous tome should have told himself before subjecting the world to his superficial \\"enlightenment.\\" I give this book one star...and one word: crap.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|It does start off a little slow, and it did confuse me a little , but once I saw the whole movie and understood what it was about I watched it several more times.  My mom watched it with me and she loved it so much I let her have it- we ended up watching it twice together.<br /><br />The animation is great as well as the imagination it took to put some of the scenes together.<br /><br />This  movie really makes you think and for me that is my favorite part of it.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is really good. It is written in a way that you understand what Alice is feeling and what is going through the mind of an Alzheimer's patient. One of those books you can't wait to pick up again and read more of. I actually found myself thinking about Alice as I went through my day and wondering what was going to happen next with her.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|had a good concept but all they did was rip off toca boca . and it was so slow and stubborn. if you want a salon game just pay the 2.99 for toca boca.  I wish it was free but its not and its worth the money.
B004GBIE3Y|3.0|Just last week I finished the book, and once I found out there was a movie I knew I had to find it. The movie was definitely not like the book nor was it as good as the book, like most cases.
B003UAHIM0|4.0|my 11 year old loved watching this-although the language was worse than I remembered. Fun for the family, even if it is a little dated at this point.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's still as good as I remembered.  I even got another person hooked on the series!  Highly recommended for everyone.

0812983459|5.0|One of my all-time favorites!! Really enjoyed this book from front to back. Great story. Simple yet profound. I'm not a big fiction reader, but found this book to be just delightful!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|What a wonderful read.  I could not put it down.  My heart goes out to all those people who lost their lives, and to the loved ones left behind.  Please take the time to read this book.l finished with tears on my face.<br /><br />Lynne
B002LANLDK|5.0|Love these movies. #3 was a little of a let down, but they made up for it in this one.
B000001EGE|3.0|I'm a big Elton John fan but this is not near my favorite. Madman Across The Water, Yellow Brick Road, and Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player dust it. I also prefer Tumbleweed Connection. Despite two of his greatest songs (Rocket Man, Mona Lisa and Mad Hatters) being present, the rest of the songs are on the weak side. One of my oldest friends and I are doing a EJ song tournament. We pick our 3 favorites off each album plus an honorable mention or two depending on the number of tracks. Both of us felt this album paled coming on the heels of Madman Aross The Water. Still it's Ej and it's good but not a five star album, at least to us.
B009VIZDLI|2.0|didnt like book at all - couldnt finish it.  frustrating from the first page.  would not recommend it to anyone.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I had to read this for the Lone Star List, so I thought it would be, like, kind of boring. It actually surprised me. I think it was a good book. :)
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is good for cheating and useful if stuck and can't find diamonds and gold<br /> To save you inventory changes you have to exit the game to main menu then go to the app and pick an item and then press the back button on the bottom or right of the screen. I am during this on a kindle fire HD and works fine<br /><br />I recommend buying this if your cheap and also buy the pro for more effects
B004TI1WME|4.0|It's fairly basic, though I hoped it would have a big enough screen to keep a calculations history like a scientific calc.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app was great for ww2 collector if you don't have enough money. But, anyways it is just great, really it is.
B000069AUI|4.0|Let me start by saying that I own all of Coldplay's albums, and this one is my second favorite, behind Viva La Vida.<br /><br />This album is full of good songs (not just the singles), including my all-time favorite song, \\"Clocks\\"!<br /><br />Some of the songs take time to grow on you, like \\"Politik\\" and \\"God Put a Smile Upon Your Face\\" did for me.<br /><br />Other personal favorite songs are \\"Warning Sign\\", \\"In My Place\\" and \\"the Scientist\\".
B00992CF6W|4.0|Trust me, I also love this app but it needs the entire full update, it needs Redstone piston n others I've told mojang on many websites... but you,should get this app... get early because every update is an increase in the price that means the game is getting better
1401235425|5.0|This is a fantastic story line.  I haven't been a big fan of the whole &#34;New 52&#34; thing that DC Comics has done, but putting Scott Snyder on Batman was one good move.  I highly recommend this to any Batman fan.
B00005J9PB|5.0|I've this movie many time and still love it! Lori Petty is funny, sassy, and kick ass in this movie!
B00B29J0I6|5.0|Great puzzels to challenge physics.  Would be nice if instructions were provided, but fairly easy to figure out.  Good time waster.
1609611543|1.0|I followed the diet strictly for ten days and had zero positive results.  I don't expect miracles in ten days, but I expect SOMETHING.  I not only didn't lose weight, I GAINED a couple of pounds.  I still had terrible sugar cravings.  I still felt very hungry between meals.

B00821PCJS|5.0|The social commentary wrapped up in sci fi is classic. Asimov, EE Doc Smith. The plot and characters could be a little tighter but overall an enjoyable watch for TV sci fi
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Felt like I spent 15 minutes downloading and an hour playing. Fun while it lasted. Essentially the game is a commercial for the pay version.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|a wonderful fun game that my daughter and I enjoyed very much and can not wait for more rooms to search through.
B0053O89JM|3.0|Good TV series. Hugh Laurie, Robert Sean Leonard, Jessie spencer, Omar Epps, Peter Jacobsen, and Lisa Edelstein are good. I especially liked the episode Nobodys Fault in season 8. Jeffrey Wright, one of my favorite actors, is great.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I read the wiki version before I bought the book. I was so inthralled in the beginning that  I did not realize it was not about one man. It was a history through eyes of the survivors an the people who fought for reformation of the zachs. Those stories an the tactics that evolved throughout this oral history should stand as manual for the impending epidemic.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I Have seen the series one, two and three.  The book is explaining so much more and make it all come together.  Riveting reading. I have found myself holding my breath whist reading as it gets so exciting.....  Breath.....
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Better then expected it passed the time that I needed it to. Drags on a little bit, but it wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen.

B0088W6LGY|5.0|Atlantis is by far one of the best stargate series! Its just like SG-1 but in a whole new galaxy. One where there are new dangers, yet new allies as well. The mixing of the Atlantis story line with SG-1 is done beautifully well. This is a must watch if you enjoyed SG-1.
B00A6WSTIW|2.0|WHAT CAN I SAY?  We rented this movie, watched maybe 15 minutes and gave up on it.  Maybe a month later, after we forgot we had had watched this and re-rented.  It  was still bad and we again quit after 20 min.  Hopefully, we won't rent a third time !<br />( with 'oldtimer's disease', who knows?)

0525457585|5.0|I remember going to the theater to see this  many years ago when my girls were young.  What a wonderful movie this was so now I want to buy the book and read it.  I bought the VCR movie and later the DVD.  Only thing is, in the movie at the theater, when the bullies put Bastian in the dumpster one of them pulled Bastian's cap off his head and put it on his own.  Later when Bastian and Falcor come to Bastians world and see the 3 bullies running down the street, Falcor swoops down and Bastian grabs his cap off the boy's head.  That scene is not in the VCR or DVD version of the movie.  But the movie is one of the best I have ever seen.  Just absolutely love it.  I know I will enjoy the book.

159463176X|5.0|This is such a poignant story - more about relationships than his previous books--rather sad, actually.  One character said it in the beginning of the book that Kabul is not the rest of the country--the rest of the country will not be brought into the 20th century let alone the 21st century anytime soon  unless technology somehow finds its way into the hinterlands.  This is an extremely remote, mountainous country - and won't be easily &#34;tamed&#34;--as we've seen in the last 10-=15 years.  I was in Kabul and Bamyan once many years ago and I can tell nothing has changed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A fairly entertaining game... needs a lot more rooms...<br /><br />makes you think and reason.... could be exceptional if only there was more to it.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|I am somewhat of a passive reader.  I may have other things going on.  Few books will allow you to multi-task.  With Martin, I can start listening at any phase.  If I get confused, I may have to search web for summaries.  Daughtrie, the reader, almost deserves as much credit as Martin for the quality of the audio books.  Martin is that oddball genius uncle who can only produce quality, but on his time frame.  His Universe allows for just a few supernaturals, which makes it seems more credible.

0345803485|2.0|...I did read about 30 pages of it via Amazon's Look Inside feature, which gives pretty much the first few chapters free, so I guess I can only comment on narrative and premise and not on whether I believe the sex scenes to be transgressive or whether this book would be a waste of time for me.<br /><br />I think that it's appeal is more a function of a society that craves titillation in an acceptable form, so when this was released under a major publisher and promised acceptable 'marginal' type sex between beautiful rich young people, everybody bit.<br /><br />I have to say it does have appeal; its' 'crack' is an age-old story line, one that continues to sell again and again, without this particular aegis: It is a by the formula ROMANCE NOVEL. And not terribly well written at that. I mean it could have been rolled out by any one of the successful authors of the genre - at least there would have been a few more believable details...a captain of enterprise 27?!...it could have been more accurate and modernly set as some social media scion. At 27, he's hardly believable as a corporate success as he is here. Interested in a college senior, bumbling about muttering about hair ties? How many times must she keep telling herself he's 'unbelievably HOT'. (eyeroll)<br /><br />So back to the appeal - as a middle aged woman who LOVED and read way more than my fair share of the romance genre between the ages of 13 and 17,(I swear I was reading one whole 200 page Harlequin romance a day during the summer.)I can tell you that the 1st person consciousness in which the story is told is MADE for this genre, where the heroine lives in constant pre-feminist doubt that she can hook the enigmatic and successful rich hot man who continually showers her with tokens of affection yet withholds ultimate approval. The assignation of a BDSM top factor to the inscrutable male and the Sub in need of a strong hand is just another level of this formula.<br /><br />I didn't find this book terribly compelling, but KUDOs to the creators of this. I wish I had written this and was rollin' in the dough from it!!!
B008Y79HE6|4.0|I love this movie. So decided to watch it again. The Print  was clear, and the sound was very good.

B002XMGGK6|4.0|Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is spending some quality family time with his wife and daughter when two thugs break into his home. They stab Shelton, rape and kill his wife, and abduct, and subsequently kill, his daughter. One of the villains, Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte), is the main perpetrator; the other, Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart), largely stands and watches. Shelton survives the attack and the perpetrators are eventually caught. In the U.S. `plea bargaining' system, Darby blames Ames for the atrocities, so gets a much lighter sentence while Ames - who participated little in the attack - gets the death penalty. Shelton is appalled that either of the perpetrators should get away virtually unpunished, so he sets out to take his own revenge. He tampers with the lethal injection so that Ames dies an excruciatingly painful death - cruel and unusual punishment indeed. He poses as a policeman to `arrest' Darby once he is released and then chops him up into pieces - slowly. Lead investigator Nick Rice knows who is to blame for Darby's death and Shelton is quite easily arrested. We are less than half-way through the story at this point - then it gets really interesting. Steadily, Shelton eliminates all the people responsible for letting Darby go free. In the end, Rice has to abandon his principles to eliminate Shelton. This was a good gripping thriller as we wait to seer what Shelton has planned next.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|A little hard to follow, but I was forewarned in a review. A complicated mix of characters, which I hope will gel in the following books. I was undecided if I would continue the series earlier in the book, but by the end I chose to give the series a chance.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Truly unique music. The Piano Guys are to pop and rock what TSO is to Christmas Carols. Watching the DVD is like being at their concert in a front row seat. Over 200 million YouTube views can't be wrong.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these types of games.  I'm 47 and its got good thinking skills.  Only 10 levels so I am dissappointed for the shortnest of the game.  Please get more levels soon.
1616960922|5.0|I'm a new fan of Brandon Sanderson's and when I saw on Twitter that his Hugo nominated novella was on sale I decided to buy it.  I really enjoyed this work.  The concept is that this world has a magic called stamping.  This allows people to rewrite an objects history and thus change the object into something else.  The main character Shai is captured during a robbery attempt where she was going to leave a new stamped painting for the original.  She is then told that her only way to escape execution is to create a stamp of the Emperor who essentially suffered brain damage and is in a coma so the realm doesn't collapse.  This is a great novel that has wonderful magic system, a fast moving plot, interesting characters, and political intrigue.  I was really impressed that a novella had this much depth.  I recommend this to Brandon Sanderson fans, fantasy fans, and even alternate history, political thriller, and paranormal fans. There's something here for everyone.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The fifth book in the series did very well on keeping me interested and unable to put the book down. The only down side is that now I have to wait for book 6. HURRY UP already...

159463176X|3.0|Well, I was waiting for another Kite Runner. But that's silly since there could never be another. I am an avid reader and KR is my favorite book of all time.<br /><br />This book is well written, and as many others have said, somewhat disconnected - too many story lines and time travel back and forth for no apparant reason. It was confusing. I think this would have been a better read and sold as many copies as a series of short stories set in Afghanistan. Each character is richly drawn and each has his or her own interesting story to tell.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|i bought this for the kindle fire that i received for mother's day. it works great & fits great too.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is definitely worth the &cent;99 or the 99 coins. You are able to play it your way, and have lots of fun while doing it. You can also buy the newest levels, and once you do, every time they add more levels, you automatically get them. Truly an amazing game which I suggest you get.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Fiction is fiction but if there are just little kernels of truth in this story, then be scared!  The main character's development both in his social and emotional life, and in the style in which the authors writes about him is complex and well defined.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This was a funny book. It was ok but it was exciting and it jumped around a little to much.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|So very proper and elegent, how could something so dreadful and cumbersome as a murder intrude upon their lovely lives?  An easy brainless read and a fairly predictable who-dun-it set with all our favorite Victorian characters, the Darcys.  If you like that kind of thing, it's not bad.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a great game. It was really interesting. I think it is an excellent game for all puzzle lover's to play.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|The individual stories were mildly interesting and it was evident that they were connected by a character that was supposed to be reincarnated but the connection was very loose.  If you weren't paying close attention, as most people do nowadays, you wouldn't have even noticed the connection and it would have seemed like a collection of random stories.  It barely held my attention and I won't be seeing the movie!
B005LAIHPE|1.0|Hollywood is officially not even trying anymore, seriously why in the world would anyone make a movie based on a board game called battleship. The movie is about as lame as it sounds it's about a group of navy soldiers fighting off a group of aliens at sea who've come to take over the world yeah not exactly original, whatever's been done here has been done better before. I wanna know the guy at universal who lost a bet and had to make this movie.
B00BY8DIT2|3.0|I was disappointed in this album after hearing their first one.  I didn't think Beth had her soul in this one like the the last album w/Joe.  I have listened to it several times and enjoy it but if I had purchased this one first, I would not have purchased a second album w/Beth.  I have all of Joe's albums and enjoy all of his.  I love their first album, but this one does not rock like the last one so I was disappointed.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is by far the best bingo app. available on the market. Only wish I could get more bingos on my cards.
B00428CPUY|4.0|Great!  The Crossroads Guitar Festival was outstanding.  I am glad I purchased the DVD so I could feel like I had been there but didn't have to deal w/the heat.  I have since purchased it for two other friends.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|OUTSTANDING! I've read SCIENCE-fiction for 60 years and this was easily the most creative scenario since FARMER'S Riverworld.  Don't miss it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really cool game, love it! I play this game every day and I cant stop playing. best game ever!!!! love it!!!!!
B000JMKRKC|3.0|I enjoyed this story within a story, with mysteries everywhere. I did not guess the answer to the pivotal mystery. Will be interested in seeing more from this author.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|This game is too hard there are no hints or clues and some of the things needed too hard to find. I got through some levels but got frustrated with the last level and have given up.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed the medium level of challenge but would definitely liked there to be more levels.  Finished all 10 levels in one afternoon.
B006ATJXQW|1.0|I was really hoping this book would give us some answers about Thomas's life before the Glade.  All new characters were introduced and I kept hoping they would tie in with Thomas and the others somehow. Not so. It felt like I was reading an entirely different story/book from the other three in the series. Definitely not what I thought it would be.
B008JFUPFI|3.0|Ive always loved the first Chris Reeve Superman film from the 70's and the second one wasnt half bad either.  This new film \\"Man of Steel\\" has a lot of good things going for it but most of the movie deals with an alien invasion that steals the show.  Zod and his cronies from Krypton attempt to take over the planet earth with their scary technology much like the martians did in \\"War of the Worlds\\".<br /><br />We dont even get to see Clark in his glasses working with Louis at the Daily Planet!  Very little time is spent on Clark and his relationship with his earth parents or his life on the farm.  It seems most of the movie is devoted to Superman and his attempts to win this battle against Zod.  Lots of stuff is destroyed in the process, and it gets very tedious quickly.<br /><br />Perhaps Im getting too old for all the over the top crap that seems so popular these days, but I know a good movie when I see one and this aint one for sure, its just ok.
B006MW3V6U|2.0|I love Downton Abby I just hate Amazon video streaming.  It doesn't work, unfortunately Amazon has exclusive rights to this series. Amazon needs to fix the problem before I order any more.  I will stay with Netflix.
1476734941|5.0|But you need to give it a couple of weeks to see results - at least I did.<br /><br />I have been restricting my caloric intake for two days a week for six weeks<br />  now and have lost almost 8 pounds.<br /> I did not experience any weight loss until about the fourth week, and<br />I'm glad I stayed with it.<br /><br />Now that I am seeing results, I almost look forward to the \\"fast\\" days,<br />and I have figured out a few things that help me get through the days.<br />I drink several cups of tea, I eat two rice cakes,<br />I eat an apple, and I arrange the 24 hour period to fall between 6pm<br />the previous day and end my fast at 6 pm the next day so that I can<br />look forward to and enjoy dinner.<br />My main meal of the day is usually a boiled egg and lots of steamed vegetables.<br /><br />One of the most important things I do is keep in mind, whenever I begin feeling<br /> uncomfortably hungry, that the feeling of hunger is something that much<br />of the world's population experiences on a daily basis.<br /><br /> Reminding myself of this sobering fact, helps to keep my feelings of hunger<br />in perspective.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|overall this is a good product, delivered on time in an excellent condition. However, in a few disks, there some sound cut out in the sentence.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was enjoyable to play a puzzle game that required you to solve multiple layers/tests within the same level before you were able to move on.  Highly recommend!
145210655X|4.0|I purchased this for my husband as a gift from our son for Fathers day.  I had thought that it would have been a special treat for my husband to read it to our son before bed.  But, the book is really for an older child... and preferably one that has seen Star Wars.<br /><br />From an adult that has seen Star Wars many times... it's cute.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I choose this rating because I love this game, it's a fun fast paste game, I like moving from different levels.<br /><br />Have been using this game about 3 mo.<br /><br />fast paste, challenging, incredible, fun.
1400044162|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, very detail as well as holding my interest.  I have since shared this book with other friends.<br /><br />Great reading!!!
B009NY43NY|5.0|The wait is finally over, I devoured this book in almost one night. I it was a good ending the the sookie series. I will miss sookie, but true blood comes back this summer! I won't miss her for that long.
B004UID2LC|5.0|love love love this downloader.  needed this so I bought it through amazon, they are the best site to buy anything from
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great app for children and adults. Excellent graphics and very nice music that plays in the background. It can get costly with the in app purchases.
B0017I1IZA|2.0|I have read several of the Stephanie Plum novels. I have enjoyed them in the past but  It seems the main character (Stephanie Plum) is getting dumber, more simple minded and just plain stupid.  She gets into situations that are moronic then needs to be bailed out by anyone she can find.  I understand she was never meant to be ultimately cleaver, but her stupid antics are tiresome in this book.  Let's give her a little credit and some brains.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I read the reviews before downloading and almost didn't get it because I do not ever spend money to progress in games.  I haven't spent a dime and am really enjoying the game.
B00A2H9PLG|4.0|I had the opportunity to see this movie as a screener tonight and I was hesitant about going...  I had tickets for both World War Z and White House Down this week but, I knew I could only go to one so I played the odds and managed to get in on the showing.<br /><br />Let me say that this is a Hollywood propaganda piece for sure and yes it mostly tries to paint the Right Wing as a war machine run by Radicals who sleep with their guns.  Honestly, I'm neither a Republican nor a Democrat and I have yet to actually cast my vote for a man whose won the white house (yes I seem to have bet on guys that didn't win) but, I go to movies for an escape from reality and Hollyweird needs to get away from the political BS.<br /><br />Okay, with all that out of the way, John Cale (Played by Channing Tatum) is a man on security detail for the Speaker of the House and he's trying to get back into his daughter's life while interviewing for a job in the Secret Service.  One thing leads to another and he doesn't get the job but, ends up taking his daughter on a tour of the white house.  Well, an extremist group sets into motion a distraction at the capital building that has everybody looking that way while the head of security at the WhiteHouse sets a plan in motion to eliminate the Anti-War President (played by Jamie Foxx and there's more to it than that but, you can find that out by seeing the movie).  Well, somehow John Cale ends up the being the only man that stands between the extremists and the president and he gets to do an on the Job interview that is as enjoyable, sometimes hilarious, and action packed as any movie in recent years.<br /><br />Let me just say, this really is Die Hard for the new generation, it is a throw back to when movies were movies and they did an excellent job with the story and production in spite of the political skewing.  I honestly feel there's only one other movie I enjoyed this much in 2013 and that was Star Trek Into Darkness so, it really shows you how highly I think of this movie as the Star Trek was easily my favorite movie of the year.<br /><br />Overall, I would give it 5 stars but, I had to take it down a peg for ruining my entertainment with politics.  So, if you love the original Die Hard, you're going to love this movie as they really do not make them like this anymore (or at least not very often)!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it reminds me of barbies horse training or whatnot that my dad and I used to play when I was smaller
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|This was a birthday present for my brother & since it was on his list, I'm sure he is quite pleased.
B0091REZMW|4.0|game was fun the items can be hard to see and the energy takes a while to build up but so far a good game
B00915G6WQ|5.0|My brother is a huge Dexter fan & has all of the previous seasons on DVD - it was a no brainer as a birthday present.
0446560065|5.0|I have enjoyed this book, it is very funny and so much like the personality of my two cats.  The author has nailed the feline personality, that is for sure
B008KMHFJY|3.0|There is no doubt that this book is well-written (no not going into the grammar or typos) but  well-written in the sense that it is hard to put down.  However it is about a very dependent relationship and Travis is way to easy to use those fists and this makes it hard to rate.  The message for YA readers is not a good one at all, or for any age but again it does get you in and is certainly worth reading as it is easy to read.<br />The other problem I had was that it is way too similar to so many other books I have read but at least the people in the other were grown-ups for the most part with wider experiences. On the other hand those books didn't flow as well as this one does.<br />I guess in the end you need to read it yourself to decide what you think but for the price I paid for this I can say definitely that I will not buy the book that follows this.  I don't need or want to hear Travis and his viewpoint when I can get better books for a fifth of the price that aren't rehashing the same story.  That was the final decider that dropped the rating to a three.
0316098515|5.0|Love this book.  It is for professional chefs, not home cooks.  Most things can be done, but definitely takes practice.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I've use the app for several weeks now on my iPhone 4... I think it works very well, no complaints other than there is no landscape mode. The screen doesn't flip!?
B00756GRUE|5.0|Once set, it keeps exceptional time.  ease of reading it underwater is GREAT!  If this is ever lost, I would buy another of the same model
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is a really.fun game very hard to put down the trick to the game is to up grade. you cant advance without upgrading.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|By far, the very best documentary on the Eagles that I've ever seen.  This gives me all of the info I would ever want.  After catching the last 40 minutes of this on TV, I knew I had to buy this DVD set and I've enjoyed watching it ......even if I have to do so in bits and pieces as time allows.  The music is fabulous and the entire project is professional, fun, and phenomenal in all ways. VERY  pleased with this purchase.  Certainly a MUST HAVE for all fans of this band.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game. Challenging enough to make it fun. Easy download. Saves game where you left off to continue later when you go back to it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Where to begin? This book was amazing. Starting out with Hazel a young girl struggling through illness and lonliness, then she meets a boy named Augustus Waters who in turn changes her life with a horribly tragic plot twist bringing sadness until the end of the book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|it works ok for me on my kindle and kindle HD . its fast and slow though but sometimes glitchy but other then that its good
B00CFQMVLS|2.0|There's more to a good Die Hard film than just taking a book and inserting the franchise characters.  This is not the real John McLane!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is an addicting game fo sure!! I love this game and when you fall or flip or something, the guys neck cracks!!! Eww! Anyways great game. GET IT
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. This just goes to show that you don't need to blow stuff up or include tons of gore and senseless violence to make a great film...
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's so fun and I am in love with it and once I'm on it I can't get off of it .its first time since I've ever had a game that interesting.so please get it . It's my favorite game so please get it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this book.  Although I know/knew nothing about car racing the story, the characters, the story teller....A perfectly wonderful bitter/sweet experience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|HIThis game is so awesome the person who made should be really famous I love this s g a me so much
B00B7Y0206|1.0|i didnt get this app but i already know its dumb do not waste ur memory for your kindle fire click on web and type up youtube and u find the exact same thing as this app
057809665X|2.0|I had high hopes for this book because of all the positive reviews. I have to say that it is more about average conversation starters rather than any sense of deep insights. There is about 5 or 10 pages of actual content and a lot of digressions into just simplistic rhetoric or simple stories. Like how to talk to a person on a flight? Not real groundbreaking stuff; I give it props for its practical nature and the short length. You could really skim on a flight for half an hour and try the practices in the back for fun. I don't think there was `off` advice although I think there should have been a greater focus on how the other perceives you and clues you can infer and adjust your strategy.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|inspirational and a super book. now i have to write a bunch of other words why do they do this to me...lol
B00782O7IY|5.0|A must for the movie lover and movie collector. We have watch it many times and it is very good
B000W965QW|4.0|i dunno. glad i read a hornby. i need to read more of his stuff to get his vibe. underwhelmed i guess. i saw the movie too.
B001GXF2YY|3.0|For Harry Bosch lovers, this book will be exactly what you want to read.  I thought it was a bit predictable and at some point, I ceased to really care who the perpetrator of the crime was.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|It was an ok movie.  I thought it was a little boring.  I fell asleep and had to watch it again.
B005OYKIJ0|5.0|This is the movie that shows how the series has matured.  The plot is well thought out and put together.
B004XWLN20|5.0|EXCELLENT SERIES - GREAT PRODUCT.<br />ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT SOME DVD'S CAME WITH NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES (ONLY FRENCH AND SPANISH).
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|No story, no problem. This game has upgrade parts and gameplay style to satisfy the excite bike/trials hd fan. the simple gameplay will keep you going for hours trying to best your top mark. definately recommend  this game.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Her voice is incredible and of course Joe's playing is off the charts as usual. One great combination of great musicians.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Terrible. Bad writing.  Horrible sentence structure grammar. Misused homonyms. Simple plot. 1 dimensional characters. Common themes taken from well known fantasy.
0452295548|4.0|This is the account of a neuroscientist's personal experience with a stroke.  She recounts her personal experience and adds to it her knowledge and insights as a neuroscientist.  She includes useful guidelines for potential stroke victims (all of us).
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Just a quick note- a good movie, but Ridley hasen't created a work of art since his first 3 films - The Duelists, Alien, & Blade Runner....since then, B work all....let us all pray for the future...<br />  The Ted talk at the Weyland Industries web site (~3min.)is inspired stuff...as good as (no, better than) the movie...if you haven't seen it, check it out (I understand Ridley's son edited it - Right On!)...
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I was expecting this book to be the last in the series and was left hanging at the end - I can't wait to read the next novel and find out what happens! I have really enjoyed the Crossfire novels - not quite as much as 50 shades of Grey - I found them fairly derivative and a lot cruder, but in the end the love between Eva and Gideon makes compelling reading and I look forward to the next in the series.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The title has multiple meanings as you will find out in reading this glorious love story. I don't want to give the story away but I can say that when I anticipated sitting down to read this book, I felt like I was going to have my dessert for the day.  It is written with insight, perception and an understanding of the human spirit...a must read. Every woman in my book club adored it!
0920668372|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite children's stories.  I think everyone should purchase this book.  I bought one for all of my children and they arrived quickly.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Couldn't be happier, have had this app for 6 months and it has been great.<br /><br />I would downloAd it again in a heartbeat.
034580404X|3.0|Like the rest of the planet, ran down to get the first installment in the three part series when I heard about it.  Reviewed it.  Read all of 60 pages and reviewed it.  This set will do this to you.  Then, bought this Whole Set for my wife six months later for Christmas.  She's never read it of course.  Who cares.<br /><br />O shock.  Now, it's a three book set.  And I see this morning, a soon to be released movie.  Yes, if you are a monogamous person rather than a East or West Poly person, buy this book for the spark.  Play with the edge of kink in your marriage like so many are giving themselves permission to be and do because of this book.  Three stars for the book.  Five stars for the author; who if you believe the interviews never so much as got a red ass even on a hot park bench in August.<br /><br />What?  20,000 reviews?  Half of them awful?  Well, someone once said four kinds of books hit the shelves: 1) good books that sell, 2) bad books that sell; 3) good books that don't sell, 4) bad books that don't sell.  Two of those are my best and favorite kind.  And yet, anything that gets folks reading is good.<br /><br />This is not a bad book but an OK book that was timed right.  Got to give a lot of points for the impact this set is having in bedrooms (and garages?) across both sides of the Atlantic pond.  Three cheers.  And three stars.<br /><br />Sure, buy this set.  Even if the wife doesn't read it!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|The color pad is an excellent way to make notes and keep up with important events. It easy to use.

1402793375|4.0|Everyone should read this book to get a better understanding of how badly the native american indians were lied to and treated in this country. A very important read!
B00881PTRC|3.0|I love hangman games and always go to my Hangman by Spice Labs which is way better!  I don't like really artsy games.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Keeps your interest and makes for a fast read.  Makes you want to read another one right away and will probably do that.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|From production to rhymes, J.Cole stepped his game up with this one. He's been one of the best in the game for a while, but this album definitely captures that greatness moreso than his more commercial freshman album Sideline Story. There's not a single track on here that you'll want to skip. That's so rare these days. Love it!! Cole World!!
B00DF0POXA|3.0|Not like any other Kanye album. It kinda of give me a techo / house music mixed with rap and auto tunes.  Lyrics are not the best, but it's a different sound.
B00AWQEKIK|3.0|A little too much Stephen Stills in 1 sitting.<br />Has all the tracks you'd ever want. It has Tree Top Flyer.
B0043URV5U|5.0|This is Bob Segar at his best, love Main Street the rest of the C D is excellent highy recommend
B008ALA6DW|3.0|Works fine, looks good.  but, the cable could be a bit longer, had a problem of it coming loose during use and causing loss of internet.
B002RB7VMA|4.0|Michael Buble has a voice and a style outside of this generation. He could easily become a classic. I enjoyed this album quite a bit.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Really good guitar driven rock n roll music. Some heavy tracks and riffs with good lyrics. I recommend this highly, I have become a fan of Gary Clark Jr. after seeing him perform live, which I also recommend highly. He has some tasty chops.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Very easy to find all i need or at least we i want. It save time because i love my kindle fire and i didn't want to write the google address everytime i want something.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Chris Nolan gets Batman. He should have to do every Batman movie from now on for as long as he lives because in this film he captures the very essence of Batman. It is a sight to behold! Love it love it love it!!! Watch it now if you haven't seen it!!!!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Was not able to download and i don't know why. Actually i have another one that works perfect for me.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Absolutely love this album. Picked it up after seeing them on SNL, I thought they were great. Really good music here, I love her voice and guitar sounds. I recommend this highly. She is like a modern day Aretha with a powerful voice full of emotion. And she plays guitar!! This went into my rotation immediately and I am always happy when one of these tunes play during shuffle mode.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've always live Nicholas Sparks. This book like all his others drew me into the story. It didn't' t end the way I thought it would-be ended better than I could have imagined!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Come on, what can you say? I will admit I had very high hopes for this record. I had questions, it's been a long time, can they still do it??  My initial play through left me a little bit disappointed. But after hearing it now 4 or 5 times it has really grown on me, like most Soundgarden records do, and I love it. I recommend it highly and will say give it a chance. Give it a couple listenings all the way through before making a judgment. Maybe it has to soak in or marinate, I don't know, but give it a chance and you will come to appreciate all the good rock n roll music on this album.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|The movie was a little disappointing.  It really answered no questions about the series, and seemed rather pointless and unlikely overall.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a uniquely gorgeous book that tells a fascinating story of war, life, and death. Its truly an amazing read
159463176X|2.0|I have purchased and read &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; by Khaled Hosseini and was enthralled by both, most especially the latter.  I purchased &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34; and I have to say It was nowhere near the exceptional storytelling of Hosseini's first two novels.  I waited for his third novel - couldn't wait to read it after ordering and receiving it.  But I have to say that, being an exceptionally avid reader lo these many years I had a hard time following the characters and time frames in this novel.  Seemed to jump from the two characters in the beginning of the story to many other characters without connecting and finally on page 312 (after struggling that far) I, for the first time in my life had to put the book down.  So I reread &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; which to me, was Hosseini's best work.  I will, however make another attempt at The Mountains - start again from the beginning and see if I can eventually make some sense out of what this book is about.  I, as I have previously stated, being an avid reader simply do not ever recall having to reread any of the numerous books I have in my library unless it is for the pure enjoyment of again experiencing the enjoyment of the first reading.  I feel bad that I have had to rate this book so low because I am a fan of Khaled Hosseini.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|Predictable with so-so special effects.  Acting was a little forced.  I would not go out of my way to recommend this.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One thing about Stephen King is his versatility.  This book is more a mystery novel than his usual horror-fiction.  The events are amazing and at times normal dark Stephen King stuff.  But, I couldn't put this one down.  I think I finished it in a matter of days.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Predictable but somewhat interesting prequel to Wiz of Oz.  Not the greatest acting but okay.  Enjoyed it during the movie but forgot about it as soon after the movie ended.

B00BIVN82M|2.0|It was just OK...did not swoon over it...really loved his first cd & Christmas ones the best.  This one is the worst...I do not even play it.  I have all of his cd's & have even been to his concerts.  Save your money on this one...it is lacking :(
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The characters were plausible, their relationships with one another realistic and time was devoted to developing each one's personality. This is the first Will Robie book I've read, but it won't be the last.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Although there was more action than the previous book, and it ends in a fairy tale love story as far as Sookie is concerned, it still leaves you hoping for a different ending or at least a bit more climactic response from Eric.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Clearly, the zombie pandemic is alive and well in the world of entertainment.  These creatures aren't just a new sensation, they've be relevant in film for quite some time now and depending on whom you ask, zombies originated in film at least as far back as the 1930s.  Regardless, zombie films have come a long way and evolved into a genre all its own, typically bordering on horror - but without a main protagonist to specifically lead the mayhem (unless you'd like to make a claim for George A. Romero).  With the recent success of the highly popular AMC drama, The Walking Dead, and the Resident Evil franchise, not to mention comedies like Warm Bodies and Zombieland - it would appear the undead are preparing to continue their reign of terror for quite some time.  And, you know zombies flicks are at the height of their popularity when Brad Pitt decides to sign on for a leading role.<br /><br />Based on the novel of the same name by Max Brooks and directed by Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Quantum of Solace), World War Z stars Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane, a former United Nations investigator called back to action to investigate the origin of a \\"zombie\\" academic.  Originally reluctant to take the assignment, Gerry decides it's in the best interest to (reluctantly) leave his family and attempt to find a cure.  However, finding an origin or a cure becomes difficult when every major city in the world becomes devastated by zombie outbreaks - leaving Gerry with little options other than to keep moving from city to city.  Mireille Enos, Ludi Boeken, James Badge, and Fana Mokoena also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />The film wastes little time, quickly turning to chaos on the streets of Philadelphia.  To be honest, the first half hour of the film feels like early episodes of The Walking Dead as we follow Gerry Lane, his wife, and their children, as they run from zombies on the street, through a building, and eventually face-off with them on a rooftop.  Essentially, that is what goes down in the first few episodes of The Walking Dead.  But, this isn't a Walking Dead comparison, and the fact that World War Z resembles a massively popular TV show is definitely not a bad way to start a film.  Zombie films should start off small, in a secluded area and then balloon from there - as the film does.<br /><br />World War Z might just be the grandest (in terms of visual scale) zombie film ever made, with all major cities falling to an unknown disease that kills people and quickly reanimates them in death as flesh eaters.  Most zombie films don't take the time to provide a grand scale look at major cities, often simply focusing on one specific city and a small group of people trying to survive within it or at least escape from it.  This film takes Brad Pitt's character from one end of the earth to the other, beginning in Philadelphia and moving to South Korea, Jerusalem, and finally a health lab in Wales.  There's no shortage of travel, nor are there many scenes without a zombie trolling around.<br /><br />You may have noticed from the synopsis or various advertisements that there is zero star power other than Brad Pitt.  This is - from beginning to end - a film dominated by Brad Pitt.  As he moves from one location to the other over the course of the film, he usually loses his supporting cast along the way (which shouldn't be too surprising).  Pitt portrays an observant character focused on the goal of finding answers, basically because he is blackmailed into it as a means to protect his family.  However, it is rather far-fetched to see the lengths army officers and other nations go to in order to protect him.  Evidently, Pitt's character really does mean a great deal to the survival of the human race - but that portion of the film is hardly understandable.  Far too many people lose their lives at the expense of allowing Pitt to move from one part of the globe to the other.  And, his character always manages to squeak his way out of danger.<br /><br />If you didn't follow the film's production news (and most people don't), World War Z had quite a bit of footage needed after the completion of filming to fully explain the ending.  Even though the ending is relatively simple and climatically uneventful, it would have been much, much worse without the added footage (basically the final 45 minutes) to fully explain the film's ending.  Sadly (mainly due to the lack of bloodshed), the film simply goes through motions of coming to its simple conclusion.  There are virtually no scenes where you're on the edge of your seat and frankly, the film's final stanza lacks the appropriate amount of drama for a zombie flick.  For once, people actually act sensible when dealing with a group of zombies - which is admirable, yet still pretty boring.<br /><br />As far as zombie movies go, World War Z isn't the best and it isn't the worst.  Still, the positives greatly outweigh the negatives.  The film is so full of action that it almost doesn't feel like a full-blown zombie flick.  It's not you traditional film about people hiding out and spending a film looking for salvation.  This film is about one man's goal to protect his family by investigating a global crisis - which just happens to be zombies.  Overall, Brad Pitt does an admiral job fighting off the well-designed villains - all while indicating he might even be back for some sequels sooner than later.<br /><br />The bottom line:  if you're a Brad Pitt lover, this might be an iffy choice.  It will depend on your devotion to him and whether or not you can handle a borderline horror flick.  However, if you're a lover of The Walking Dead or simply enjoy action-packed zombie movies (minus things constantly popping out at you in typical horror movie fashion) - this film is for you.  You certainly won't walk out of this film disappointed.  In fact, you'll walk out looking forward to a promising sequel.<br /><br />Grade:  C+<br />FNDNreview.com>If you didn't follow the film's production news (and most people don't), World War Z had quite a bit of footage needed after the completion of filming to fully explain the ending.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Akin to The Graveyard Book, but not quite as good. Mr. Gain man's books always go a little beyond where my imagination can take me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Crazy good reading.  I actually took the book to work so I could read it during any free time I could find.  Kept my attention from the first page.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This is not quite what I thought it was so I play it but is isn't my fav to play
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|This film is a microcosm of how the United States is being subjected to outside forces to reformat America to a third world cesspool. Good that there are still actors and directors in America that care about America. More Heros and less zeros is required. Stand up and take responsibility for your life instead of abdicating your birth rights to the enemy, let Integrity and Honor be your guide<br />  Thank You,<br />  Jerry Jay Hanson
B000SUW8MK|5.0|I have carried a copy of this book with me since 1947.  It has travelled with me through two wars and four countries.  Shakespeare proves that human frailty is timeless and universal.
B0026S98TS|5.0|Really good stuff by Black Sabbath II.  Typical Dio lyrics, and the band is still so tight.  Fantastic stuff. RIP rjd
B00A83075M|5.0|One of the best,  most completely fun movies of the year.  The heroine's levity at Ralph's &#34;Heroic Doodie&#34; is one of the highpoints.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Game runs on kindle fire hd very well. No crashing or freezing yet.  Graphics are outstanding.  I really like the game
0756686970|5.0|I really like this book! Specially the minifigure is very cute! I always wanted to know, these infos about minifigures.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I chose this rating because the book deserves all five! It has its ups and downs but that's what made it so much as to like you were there yourself! I recommend this book to all who love Rick Riordan books &adventure!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I adore this game.it's so much fun if anyone is saying that this game is a waste of time or etc don't listen.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|It was a mystery all the way. I never knew what was coming up next. I just loved it. Just amazing.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I'll read anything by Preston/Childs. Anything. Because they speculate, entertain, and educate their readers about strange phenomenon.  And Pendergast is a really strange phenomena. This is the third in the Helen Pendergast grouping and, frankly, I'm glad they brought it to an end. I believe their forte is in the singular mystery book, not a continuing series with the same cast of characters. That said, it was nice to become reacquainted with some of the more familiar characters and solve the mystery of Constance (of course we knew where her baby was). But I hope we're done with Pendergast's brother, wife and his ward.  The semi-tragic loneliness of the main character is part of his appeal.  Take us back to the earlier stories wonderful, stand-alone mysteries that, of course I'll read.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is one if the best seasons, almost as good as the 1st and 4th. Already preordered the blu-ray version as well.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|A wonderful film with many fine characters and a lot of wonderful music...the counter point between Reginald and the young rapper is one of the high lights.  Cicely is marvelous -- just ditzy enough to be real, and a voice to remember. Wilf is a bit wicked as some older gentlemen are.  Reginald does spend a lot of time staring off into space but he is basically kind and caring.  The only actor who doesn't come through as totally true is Dame Maggie Smith -- just a bit too dragon like for the character (although the character must be played by a bitchy sort).  Everything else, the scenery, the rooms, the little intrigues -- just perfect.<br /><br />The stroke of genius is the featuring of genuine musicians and players.  A good movie for those of us who don't wish to watch gratuitous violence and animated droids, but real people in a real life situation.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|Accurate description, good price no visible scratches. Plays well, doesn't skip... some decent songs on this CD. Thanks so much!
B008764ZQ4|5.0|I loved the move- I laughed so hard I was crying!!  So I had to buy the soundtrack.  I saw a video of Tom singing a few months ago, so decided to purchase the music.  All of the singers do a decent job on the songs, and I like this one much better than the bands who originally played/sang the songs.
B007704HO6|5.0|Its just a lovely story about how a man and cat save each other. It's all about love and understanding,and is my idea of a feel good story.Cant wait for the next one.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I am a ***HUGE*** Mad Men fan-love it!  It is so well done in every way.  I am currently watching Season 6.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|Kanye is one of the leading innovators in popular music. This is a little heavy on being provacative \\"cause he can.\\" However he takes a number of risks and makes some statements that are brilliant. He and his collaborrators did an excellent job. Some of the music is beautiful and some of the lyrics are poetry set to music. It's on!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Works as it should.  Just the right size and the 2.1amp does it's job.  Also being able to charge 2 devices at the same time on a road trip is nice.  Great price, great product.
B006GLLREU|5.0|But I became totally engrossed in the miseries of this dysfunctional family at a later time. The entire cast is terrific, but Michael C Hall (subtle and amazing) and Frances Conroy steal the show in my opinion.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a reminder to look beyond what you see and see the person inside.  To be kinder than is necessary and always be true to yourself. Great lessons at any age.
B00BQPEIT2|2.0|Too easy for children to want to add more money to account , thus taking off the credit card.  This game I deleted very quickly
0062255657|5.0|Have you ever gone back and revisited a place that was special to you from your early childhood?  A place that you remembered as larger than life and almost mythical in the adventures it provided.  It's always smaller and less grand when you revisit it as an adult, yet you can still remember those times when the world was bigger and brighter, sometimes more joyous and sometimes more frightening than it will ever be again.<br />Neil Gaiman takes us all on just such a journey in this novel.  A man who has returned to his childhood home for a funeral takes a side trip to a small farm pond - the ocean.  The visit brings back memories of a frightening period in his childhood and of a most unusual girl named Lettie Hempstock.<br />Lettie, her mother and grandmother seem to be very ordinary but through his adventures with Lettie he learns that there is much more than meets the eye to these three women, their small farm and especially the pond.<br />The adventure that follows is purely magical.  There are mythical creatures, magic spells, and alternate universes.  It's a short book and honestly I can't imagine not devouring it in one sitting because it's impossible to put down once you've started reading.<br />If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you must not miss this novel.  It is, however, definitely for a more adult reader. There are a couple of adult elements that wouldn't be suitable for younger children to read.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough.  It leaves you with a sense of awe and wonder and a feeling that perhaps those memories of yours aren't all just childhood fantasies. Maybe there really is a secret magical world still out there somewhere.  It definitely exists within The Ocean at the End of the Lane.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|After reading this author's previous books I did not feel that this one measured up to the others. I had high expectations. The storylines and characters were hard to follow. I did not feel drawn to the characters or compelled to keep reading. I did finish the book but felt unfulfilled.
0452289963|5.0|Tonight a thought came to mind about how what I read is a bit parallel to the first Matrix movie and would be a good way to explain some things to others considering buying this book.<br /><br />Morpheus' line from the Matrix movie: \\"You were born into a prison....one that you cannot smell, nor see, nor taste, nor touch. A prison for your mind.\\" This prison, like the matrix, is a dream like state. A state of unawareness in which your thoughts that have been running around in your head (conditioned thought) hides the true reality of life from you like a veil over your eyes. Once this veil is lifted so much of the world and the Universe flows in. The ego being like a dam wall which held back the waters of truth, compassion (including self compassion) and beauty will fall if one takes to heart the pointers in \\"A New Earth.\\"<br /><br />Like Neo, from the Matrix movie, you may reject or rather the ego may reject these ideas as the Self (your spirit) begins to put some space...some distance between your thoughts and your spirit. When you open yourself to these spiritual truths that will ring true in your mind and heart you'll know it is right. Not because of a convincing argument, but a deeper truth that lies beyond thought...in our essence, our nature.<br /><br />There is more space and peace within me each day in which I need much less and wish to give much more.<br /><br />* Neo means \\"change\\"...a fitting name for the character.<br />** You are not your thoughts because you think them.....
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What can I say , just love the drama and script.  Love love love Maggie Smith who delivers the few lines she has like a master.
B009YQJ322|5.0|Ok, first of all stepping into this I have never been a huge Judge Dredd fan. When I saw the old campy 1995 version I got a good laugh and went about my business, never thinking to much of it. So when I saw that they were making another Dredd I thought it would just line up with the rest of the action packed but plot absent movies that are being rolled off the conveyor belt nowadays. So when it was available for rent at the only remaining video store in town I took it home expecting to be disappointed. I was very wrong.<br /><br />It has been a long time since a movie has really grabbed a hold of my collar and drug me through the plot and story but this one did it with such precision I had to make sure I wasn't making it up. This movie holds so true to the ideals of the comic series that it feels like you are reading a series of them in order. The movie is dark, and gritty and very bloody but in all that violence you begin to feel and understand the huge task it is to patrol and respond to the crime of Mega-City One.<br /><br />And it isn't just the well done violence and effects that leave you on the edge of your seat. The character development and chemistry between Dredd and Cassandra Anderson is in my humble opinion, some of the best I have witnessed in a film.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of film, however if excessive blood isn't your thing I suggest you rent it first before buying.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Completely love Andrea Bocelli, my mother played this in the background during our our christmas dinner and everyone enjoyed listening to him.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|If you like awesome games you found the perfect one this game is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool luv it suuuuuuuuuper fun :) please review good love LiBii gamez. :)
B004XXIHS2|5.0|This is an excellent read.  Full of all kinds of twists.  If your a fan of mysteries, this is a good page-turner.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I felt that writing was good and kept me hooked but I did not like the ending. There were several loop holes.<br />**********Spoiler alert*********<br />The biggest loop hole was that no on cared to check where Desi was on the day of \\"kidnapping\\". The guys who robbed Amy's $8000 could have been used later in the book, the guy who met Desi and Amy in casino could have been used to nail down the murderer.<br />I agree with some reviewers that you just cannot make a character do anything in the name of being sociopath.<br />I felt that Gillian Flynn finished the novel in haste to meet the book deadline :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game....lots of variety and memory required....similar to 100 floors but better.  very creative..great graphics and multiple steps make for longer game.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This app is great overall it is addicting free and has amazing graphics if you are reading this dont turn get this app
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|If you start with an interesting book for teenagers and dumb it down for Hollywood, you get this.  Saved by the charms of Jennifer Lawrence and a serviceable supporting cast, it's a fun diversion if you don't expect much.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book was captivating. Utterly captivating. I loved it. So far I've read it twice. Going to see the movie today. Probably won't be as awesome.
B00005LK94|4.0|I used to watch this film with my little sister when were children. It was her favorite, and I always enjoyed it. We recently bought a copy of it for her twentieth birthday and rewatched the film. It's just as good years later. We hugged, laughed, and cried. It's a touching film about family and learning to live together again. Great for all ages.
B006ZDS7CE|1.0|The entire album is unlistenable. I can usual get through about 2/3rds of any given song before it just STOPS PLAYING. The only way I can get it to move past that point is by manually fast forwarding past that part in the music.  I was definitely better off listening to her music on youtube.<br /><br />I hesitated to review this album to scathingly because I DO LIKE LANA'S MUSIC, but I thought everyone who is thinking about buying it on amazon should have all the information. As a disclaimer, some of amazon's music downloads do work. I don't know why this one is so awful.
B00821OX98|4.0|A little funky but still has some plot and suspense.  The rest is fill in words to get this to post.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|So glad it's nice and new.  No scratches or anything.  My son enjoys this movie.  Watched it several times already.
B00B2DGYQS|5.0|Having seen and enjoyed the original film Yossi and Jagger by the talented Israeli director Eytan Fox, I was anxiously awaiting this sequel, and it did not disappoint.<br />Excellent performances by the entire cast and another feather in the cap of Eytan Fox for his wonderful direction. Anxiously looking forward to his next film.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Its like several different stories,  not really a unit. Want to know mire about each story, seems inomplete. I wax really dissapointed, as I loved both Kiterunner as well as A thousand splendid suns.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The acting was ok but the story line was nothing new.  Very predictable, nothing new.  If you want<br />something sci it's ok.
B005TKD8ZK|3.0|Good read but not absolutely necessary. There are better books on running. Read if you like Murakami but not essential.
B009PU2SX8|2.0|This album is a disappointment overall but, there are some bright spots in the bluesy/rock grooves scattered here and there. The best songs on the album are the raw, unfiltered, blues songs and there's only a couple of them.  His next album should stick to traditional blues/rock grooves and skip the overproduced, artistic exploration that spoiled this album.<br /><br />Do not buy the whole album, preview each song first and download the good ones.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno will always be one of my favorite movies. It's just the feeling of reality that makes this movie so good! I love how the cast works together, and make magic in this film.<br />Nowadays, teen pregnancy is shown as a mess, irresponsibility, drama, but with Juno, we get to see another side of it, especially if the pregnant girl is a really special and different like Juno. The script is charming, and some lines as little as they are, they make you laugh without even trying, you can also relate to any of the characters, and the greatness of this film is shown with all the countless nominations it had.<br />I have seen it like four times, but I think I would see it again and again, and never get tired of it.
B0081336FO|5.0|The elusive plots end in a genuine quandary, is Sherlock dead? No? Then how was that pulled off. Oh my.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I was listening to our local public radio station a week or so ago and heard part of an interview with the author. I turned it off half way through because I knew that I wanted to read the book and didn't want to hear any more in case of 'spoilers'.<br />I finished it last night in tears. Tears for her, for her family, for her lovers, and for that part of me that she truely touched.<br />We all have our own trail to walk and, damn, sometimes our feet really hurt.<br />Read it. Read it. Read it.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|really loved it, exactly what I thought it would be and very inspirational. So glad that I decided to buy it!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Seems like Gaiman is constantly and consistently getting better with each book.  I have a hard time expressing how much I loved and enjoyed this one; \\"absolutely magical\\" is the closest I can come.  The way he blends the everyday and the mystical so effortlessly, his wonderful way with language, the way he can tap so (apparently) easily & readily into what it was like to be a child, to bring that to the forefront even as the story is narrated by the boy's older self, giving meaning to events that an adult can consume and incorporate while still maintaining that odd combination of innocence and...I don't know what to call it.  Not certainty, not knowledge, not wisdom...yet something that encompasses all that.  He perfectly captures a young child's ability to accept even the most fantastic at face value while still remaining wholly anchored in the \\"real world.\\"<br /><br />The lack of names in the book--the narrator is never named, nor are members of his family--serve to fully ensconce the reader within the world he's created, leaving one wondering how many times they've returned to their own Hempstock Farm....<br /><br />And Ursula Monkton--easily one of the most heinous villains of the past hundred years.
B0061S073A|5.0|great for my boys 3&amp;5 who are still learning how to navigate all the choices. now I never worry about them hopping on the Internet or messing with my books or games :) best app I've downloaded for my munchkins busy fingers.
1781162646|5.0|Disappointed that it wasn't offered in e-format, but it's a paperback & easy enough to carry around for the few days it took me to read.  As usual, characterization is brilliant, plot is good, and all those little world building details you've come to expect from King are there.  There is a part of me that wonders if the story wouldn't have been better without the (mild) supernatural overtones but I'm pleased with it the way it is.
159562015X|5.0|Everyone in our department read this book and took the assessment. Doing so has greatly improved the way we work together. Projects are now assigned based more on strengths, rather than typical job descriptions. We are more productive and happier.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Winter of the World is the continuation of the story about several prominent families in Germany, America, UK and Russia. I liked the first book in this trilogy (Fall of Giants), a few things bothered me about his understanding of American history during Wilson's presidency, but not enough to keep me from buying Winter of the World. However, Winter of the World has not kept my interest. Not only is it slightly boring but it is historically inaccurate when it comes to American history. Ken Follett's portrayal of European politics seems fairly accurate. However he  doesn't seem to understand the difference between the American Left (Democrat) vs. Right (Republican) politics in America. They are very different than their European counterparts. Ken Follett does not seem know that the KKK/slavery and racism are tenants of the early Democratic Party, not the Republican Party. He never mentions the fact that both Democrat presidents Woodrow Wilson and FDR were extremely racist and were proponents for euthanizing inferior races. Or that it was FDR (a Democrat) who was imprisoning innocent Japanese during WWII, not the Republicans. Follett seems to equate American Right to European Nazism, however in reality it was more of a Progressive attribute of the American Left to support Hitler, i.e. Joseph Kennedy.<br />Follett also has a case of anachronism. He lost me when he imposed modern thoughts and acceptances on the culture of the 1930's and 40's. For instance, one of the characters comes out of the closet to his brother as gay. Several of the sympathetic characters act as though they are ready to fix him up and throw him a wedding. This is something that would seem normal in 2012, not 1941. The story would have been much more interesting had Follett described the challenges of the gay character that were specific to that time period.<br />These inaccuracies made the book impossible for me to finish. Ken Follett's credibility on American history and his tendency for anachronistic writing was disappointing.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|First I want to say I love Erotic Romance books. Gets my blood going. I read some of the disappointed reviews on this book. Someone mentioned that it's price gauging and that she's just stretching out the story to get money. I'm pretty sure people pay for cable....and for what? Every week your show will leave you hanging and have to wait the next week to see what happens. It's called Story Telling people! If you've ever heard of VC Andrews she does the same thing. This book was awesome and I love the developing stories of the reporter, cary, and corrine. I can't wait for the next book! I love how Sylvia put enough detail to get your own imagination going but not too much to where it bores you to death. I already have the girls in the office I work at reading the Crossfire series.<br /><br />Oh, and if you ask me, the third book of FSofG was a disappointment...this third book was not!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Interesting read. Reading is worthwhile. Will give you a lot to think about. I still wonder about Dr. Alexander's ability to remember his experiences.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|Its only free for the first short part of the game. Then it prompts you to pay $3 to continue. So i did. It was very short after that and im sad i wasted my money.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|This is simply the best book I've read in a really long time. This is a really powerful book that melds memoir, self examination, and physical adventure, and balances those elements near perfectly. The quality of the writing is exceptional, and Cheryl's personal story is compelling. About half way through this book I found myself thinking about the individual friends that I want to tell &#34;you've got to read this book!&#34;
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I loved every bit. I recommend this to everyone it's a perfect book and it made me want to watch the movie.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|after the success of their long over-due album, it's now time for a new eagles album keep up the good work
B006FZIETS|2.0|This early Fitzgerald book was disappointing.  It reads like a immature first novel and it's very mannered and self conscious.  Not a great work of art.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|this is a throwback to the earlier sound of Rod Stewart, his unique voice and writing go hand in hand with this work, Next alum should rock a bit
1781162646|5.0|I love books like A Fine Dark Line and To Kill a Mockingbird- coming of age stories with a nasty villain to vanquish and an atmospheric feel to them. Joyland did not disappoint. There are supernatural elements to this story, but the bad guy is only human. Cunning and intelligent, but human. This was an excellent read with great characters and an interesting plot.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Loved it.  Hard to put down.  Kept my interest from start to end.  Cant wait to read the next book.

B003G8Y4QO|5.0|The whole family loves Dr. Who. Give it a try. the special effects may not be the latest and greatest, but they are good enough. The real attraction is the stories. Dr. Who stories are entertaining and thought provoking. Best of all they are usually fresh; no retread of the same old thing in so many shows on TV.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I am 75 yrs old, enjoy science fiction and really liked this book, I am now keen to read the rest of the quintet.
B000035P5E|4.0|The film is relatively faithful to the book. I lked the ending in the book better. A few more words about the true story in a postlog would be welcomw.
B00847KFDS|5.0|As a long time John Fogerty and CCR fan I was intrigued by a duet album. It does not disappoint.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|The book is hard to follow at times but always makes sense in the end. The parts about how everything is a moment in time and exactly how it's supposed to be is especially beautiful. It makes the sad moments a bit more bearable because you know the better moments are still out there somewhere.
B00846REIS|5.0|I knew it would be hard to read anything after Fifty Shades but this book was awsome!  I absolutely loved it!  Two messed up souls finding each other...brilliant!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|All I Can say is wow!  Awesome turn in this book, this book makes you really think.  I Loved it!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|A story of personal growth is going to reflect some mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes are not actually the mistakes they seem to be.<br />If she remained married to her husband and had not had sex with three men in as many days would her life today be better or worse? Who is to say.<br />I did a great adventure trip. I did not do anything more than beer and watch others do various drugs. I had some romances and then got married for many decades. I do not know that I am a better or worse person for not doing a little more dope, have a few sexual encounters or hiking a thousand miles. I would be someone else to some small degree, I suppose.<br />I very much enjoyed Cheryl's story and as a person who has peeled a few blackened toenails off my feet, I did feel her pain. I also watched my boots fall off a mountain. It is a special experience.<br />Loved the book. I hope you have more stories to tell us, even if they are not so painful.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book.  Nice way to go into Gideons character.  I am totally excited this series is not ending yet.  Cannot wait to find out what will happen with these two interesting people :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes you think. Great game! I have really enjoyed playing. Looking forward to many hours of fun. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys being put to the test.
B008GGA5EQ|5.0|Stayed up all night to finish. Let's you into a world without judgement for you to draw your own conclusion. Honest writing  that compelled me to write my first review.
B008M721MS|5.0|I often take my Kindle on vacation for both business and entertainment.  When out of the country, Skype is the best connection back to the US.  It makes telephone calls outside the country affordable.  Now that I have my Kindle HD, when we go on vacation to Mexico, I leave my laptop at home.  With the addition of Skype, my Kindle does everything I need it to.
B0051E9INK|5.0|This was one of the best Highlander movies. I wish they would remake it with a modern twist. I'm going to watch the other's again but I still think this one is my favorite
B0031R5K72|5.0|I read this book years ago. I'm now in a book club and it was chosen as our book. I am not usually a fan of re-reading, but I think I enjoyed it even more the second time around. I absolutely love the way Zusak writes... nothing sort of brilliance. The story is very touching. I'd recommend it to anyone!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This is kind of fun watching, especially if you are a female and have had the experience of birthing a child!
0955153077|5.0|I bought this book to guide through a digital painting project for school. This books is for you if you already have a fairly good understanding of photoshop. Also, you should spend some time getting used your stylus before attempting any of the techniques in this book. Other classmates also bought this book and found it very useful.<br /><br />One the best parts in this book, is the quick tips in the last section. Quick tip shows how to paint hair, eyes, skin, stars, fabric, grass, etc..
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is adorable and enjoyable for the entire family. I purchased this so my 3 year old could enjoy it b4 the 2nd one comes out nxt mnth. Glad I did!
B00009RAJH|5.0|Fleetwood Mac (self-titled)<br /><br />  First, you have to understand that I am OLD and therefore I remember well the Original Peter Green blues-band known as Fleetwood Mac.  THAT band was the high point of Fleetwood Mac's history (musically, if not commercially).  Therefore, it took me a very long time to warm up to the McVie, Buckingham, Nicks version of the band.<br /><br />  That being said, and as much as I wish the original band had stayed together, I have to confess that this is a brilliant album.<br /><br />  It took the band a few years to find their 70's sound, but with this album they not only found their sound, they partially defined the sound of the decade.<br /><br />  PS.  I did not buy the `deluxe' version.  I was quite satisfied with the original CD in a cutout bin.
B0026ZNL80|1.0|...Headache music from a band trying to be a 4th rate Rusted Root. What makes it even more laughable (besides their lack of \\"musicianship\\") is that they are trying to sound mysterious and serious...I don't know whether to laugh harder or yawn. Lots of thump-thump and aaaaaahhhhhh vocals and crescendos but nothing really worth listening to.<br />Where's the aspirin?
B000001EC1|4.0|Bon Jovi<br />Crossroad (Icon/14 classic grooves)<br /><br />Bon Jovi is a terribly over-rated band but they did make a handful of nice pop-rock hits and this CD has all of them.
B00867GHS8|3.0|The blu-ray itself is outstanding very sharp. The 3D blu-ray left me feeling cheated. It really didn't look any different to me or my wife and we love 3D movies. For a 3D conversion this is very weak! We just watch the regular blu-ray and convert it to 3D which looks better than the 3D blu-ray! Disney dropped it on this conversion, very poor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Love this product. I love the color too. It has protected my Kindle very well. I would recommend something like this if you are planning on carrying your Kindle around (which I assume you will for things like pane rides and reading books on the train or bus)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i love playing this game. good brain exercise. it gets addicting! i dont know how i stumbled across it but im glad i did :)
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I did not like the symbolism of the music box nor the implied sexuality of the first act.  I did not understand why Mila's character was obviously red in preference of color and why Rachel's color preference was green.  Why did Rachel's character not eat of the apple and turn into the Wicked Witch of the West, with the green colored skin&iquest;  Mila's character would have become the Wicked Witch of the East with the Ruby Red Slippers.
B003XRELEI|2.0|There is no theme. The book would be a remarkable achievement for a 19 year old but Vonnegut seems drug addled and aimless. I enjoyed slaughterhouse five but this was out there. A quick read but I wouldn't recommend it for there is not enough time in one's life to waste reading nonsense.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Ted is very entertaining and has you laughing out loud.  Not suitable for young children.  Clever technology brought Ted to life.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Felt like I didn't &#34;get&#34; many of Tina's references--probably a generational thing.  Read the entire book but not a great read.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Just an ok movie, a bit of disappointment really. Bruce Willis was so so and there was just not enough action by the heroes just lots crashing cars. The last one was much better. The story line was good but something was missing...
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Possibly the  best book in the series so far....the search for kinsman, the discovery of CRAZY secrets. Buying the next one right.....now.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Fast read;  one of the best books I've ever read.  Gonna download the next book by this author.  Bravo on a great read
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The Finale Deathly Hallows will be REMEMBER for the climax battles betweens Harry Potter and Voldmort. Dubby's death will be also remember like father,like son because at the end Harry watched his son take the train to Hogwarts School of Magic & Witchcraft.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I downloaded this app on my kindle fire due to the positive ratings I read and was not disappointed.  It works well and is fun to play.  Sometimes it is hard to start, but you soon start to understand the logical order that each thing needs to complete the level.
B008MM9630|3.0|This game is fun and easy to make progress in, but it freezes and any progress I had made up to that point was lost. Try to make sure that you save as often as you can.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game except that it can be a little confusing. This is the first game I go to every day. Like the different rooms.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As the the late, great Augustus Waters said, \\"My thoughts are stars that I cannot fathom info constellations.\\"<br />An  I completely agree. I cannot  possibly described  how much this  book has helped me, and how this author, the amazing John Green, has given me a new perspective on life.<br />All I can say is, this is a book that will change your life.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Saw the movie. I happen to like &#34;real&#34; Hawaiian music particularly slack key style. This is unique in that the entire music soundtrack was completely written and performed by local Hawaiian artists and musicians.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addicting!  I see absolutely no problems with this game! This is my favorite game!I love how you can change the outfits for each person. Even the background music intersets me!
B009GEOLM4|1.0|I was very dissapointed to find that was animated!  Nothing in the synopsis described this. Poor and misleading description.<br />I watched the Dark Knight yesterday and assumed that this was a sequel.<br />How do I get a refund?
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Extremely entertaining! There are a few things I'd change, because,  it's WAY to easy to hit buttons on the screen while trying to accomplish the goal, interrupting your progress.  Fun overall, though, and extremely entertaining!
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|Had never seen all of this, all the way through.  The HD is absolutely incredible. This is a masterpiece;; one for the ages. Sheen is spectacular and despite all the hoopla Coppola refeived for this, it is was not enough and is still worthy decades later. If you've never seen, everyone should. If you have, take the time and watch again.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Possibly the best book I have ever read. Kept me up until 6am a week straight. Can't wait to dive into the next one!
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Good fun and clean. A film that we wanted to share with others.  May have to buy or rent again.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I found this 4 episode of the Die Hard saga to be somewhat boring and disappointing.  I hope this is the last one as I loved the first 3 Die Hards.
B00340I4KG|5.0|I love anything that John Travolta is in.  THis movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was a fun puzzle game. I wish the puzzles were a little more challenging because It only took me about three hours to complete. I hope they add more levels soon.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This is said to be the firsts big-budget SF film ever made.  It is loosely based on Shakespeare's &#34;The Tempest&#34; which is loosely based on a shipwreck in the Caribbean shortly after the invasion of the Western Hemisphere by the Europeans.<br /><br />It is the source of many SF tropes, such as the Transporter in Star Trek.<br /><br />It is a cautionary tale abut hubris and the dangers of the unconscious.  Well directed, well acted, it may be slow for modern audiences who are used to explosion-per-minuite modern films, but it's well worth watching and the theme is timeless.
B008JJM88Q|2.0|This one was not interesting enough to pursue.  So maybe other people would consider it entertaining.  Four more words required.
0307744434|2.0|I'm wary of books that offer \\"#1 on the New York Times bestseller list\\" as some kind of recommendation, and \\"The Night Circus\\" reinforced the caution.  It was long. It was repetitive. It featured pages and pages of description without character development or depth.  It was not as clever as it wanted to be.  I would not recommend this book to anyone with an appreciation for literature. But if you want to read something that has sold a lot of copies, have at it.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Great music and well performed.  A movie to watch several times. This music will stay in your head - it's addictive.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Very concise, enjoyable album. If you are a Kanye West fan old or new (and by that I mean you actually listen to his whole albums and enjoy them, not just singles you hear from G.o.o.d. Music or the Throne) then you will love this album. It is more experimental then previous albums and has more of an 808 heartbreak vibe but done a lot better. If you don't like the way kanye uses autotune you might be turned off.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|Full frontal nudity and vulgar language ruined an otherwise decent story line. Definitely an adult oriented movie, Not worthy of a second viewing.
1575666286|5.0|This is so simple for anyone wanting to truely get &#34;well&#34;.  Is it time-consuming & difficult to adjust to?  Yes.  But, I will be making even more adaptions to my eating lifestyle.  Will I be giving up meat, fish, avocados? No--but I will cut the amount of meat eaten back.  Will I continue to purchase as much organic foods as possible? Yes.  Will I also cut back on my milk, cheese unless I can find unpasteurized or raw products? Absolutely!  And...shudder....I've started doing occasional coffee enemas!<br />The info & explanations of how your body works, etc alone are worth the purchase.<br />If, God forbid, I were to develop cancer or other disease, I would go this route & not the traditional medical route. Through a friend, I know a person that cured himself from stage 4 liver cancer with the Gerson Therapy.  I believe making a lot of these suggested changes now will keep me from being faced with that choice.  Hope this helps the reader!
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I'm really enjoying &#34;Lark Rise to Candleford&#34;, season 1.  There are enough colorful characters--plus a liberal dose of unrequited love--to satisfy anyone who likes to imagine what life might have been like in a 'simpler day'.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I really enjoyed this as a kid. As long as the developer keeps this without internet required then i will have fun game to play on the airline.
B000N90JGI|5.0|This is one if my favorite movies.  It has a lot of comedy and a few romantic moments.  I only wish they elaborated more at the end. Great acting from all characters. :)
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Outstanding book, old, wild west flavor, in a modern day setting.  Walt Longmire is the man's man, and his supporting cast is excellent.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Have read many, many books on WWII and this one is without reservation one of the best.  Why?  Because of the human element.  The technical elements are there, the historical elements are in place but they are brought to life by the humanity of the characters. Simply a .org, great read.
B00CAUH7UE|5.0|well, there are obviously FOUR!!<br />Interesting read and a great way to find out where you would place yourself.<br />I learned lots about myself too!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It comes as promised and that's all you really need to know. It's a great movie with good singing with he exceptions of Hugh Jackman, who's singing was adequate, and Russell Crowe, and don't get me started on him.
1881273989|4.0|I have enjoyed this book very much. Learning about how others express and receive love has helped me understand many of my relationships! And it's an easy read!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I did this video for 2 months at the beginning of the year.  I had lost control of my eating and had not exercised in a year and just knew the ol' New Years Resolution \\"I will start running\\" was not going to cut it.  I have had this video for a few years and have done it off and on.  I made a commitment to myself to get up before work and do it M-F.  I did it and of course I saw changes and moved on to her Rin30 as I was ready for more of a challenge. This is a great place to start if you just need some structure and a place to begin.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Felt like I was part of the team tracking down the Panther.  It's always a pleasure being in the company of John Corey.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|this app allows me to buy and/or download ebooks from amazon. I am very happy being able to access amazon.
0345525558|1.0|I really disliked this book.  It was boring, predictable and a bit tedious.  At best it is a summer beach read.  I really like good literature that is thought provoking...this was not!<br /><br />The ending read like a fairy tale where \\"everyone lives happily ever after\\".  I just wanted the book to be over!  I am baffled by the number of 5 star reviews.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I have enjoyed The Good Wife.  It has strong female characters and I especially like mysterious Calinda.  I watch the episodes on my iPad with my ear buds using the Amazon app.  Great!
0307950654|1.0|I should have known better than to buy a \\"sequel\\" to Pride and Prejudice, but I was in an airport looking for a mystery and the reviews on the jacket were quite good.  What were those reviewers thinking?  The book fails on all fronts. As a mystery, the author simply phones it in.  There's not even a sleuth.  The mystery is revealed through a series of confessions, with the protagonists stumbling into the (melodramatic yet predictable) truth.  The clues are obvious and may as well have been highlighted.  Important moments in the plot (which is barely a plot) are glossed over in a couple sentences of narrative, while unimportant moments are dwelled on at length.  The book also fails as a supposed sequel to Pride and Prejudice.  The writing bears only the most superficial resemblance to Pride and Prejudice (characters have the same names; it's set in the same period) -- the book has none of the wit, satire, insight, depth, or romance of Austen. Darcy and Elizabeth have very little interaction -- Elizabeth is barely part of the book in fact.  If you have any inclination to read Death Comes to Pemberley, may I suggest you re-read Pride and Prejudice instead.
B009X2CVXA|4.0|I found it difficult to get into this book at first but, as usual, Kate Morton tells a very good story which has several twists and keeps you wanting to keep reading to find out more. The characters are adorable and thoroughly believable and the content is well researched. A well written book but I still prefer The Secret Keeper personally, but I would recommend this book to others for sure.
B001IYCMNA|4.0|I bought 2 of these to replace old Linksys WAPs in my home network hoping to take advantage of the higher speeds provided by my ISP and increase the coverage throughout my home. The coverage is a little better than I had with my ancient Linksys WAPs, but not at the 5GHz band. Within about 20 feet, I can maintain a stable connection at 5Ghz and see about 25% improvement in upload speed and about 50% improvement in download speed. Outside that distance, I often get dropped connections and must manually switch over to the 2.5 GHz band. At 2.5GHz I get better coverage than I had with my old WAPs, but not any noticeable improvement in upload/download performance. Playing with the antennae doesn't seem to make much difference.<br /><br />The ease of configuration (Full disclosure -- I had some professional help) and the improved security options pushed me from a 3 star grade to 4 stars.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I found this book had a weak and drawn out storyline with most of the emphasis being on sex.  I was tempted to buy the second book to see what happens next, but I decided that I would prefer to spend my time reading something else.
B001BFFTO0|2.0|I bought this product banking on the perceived quality that Timberland had in my eyes. I returned my first pair because they were too big, I'd recommend sizing down 1.5 sizes. I usually wear a 9 and the 7.5 fit me. My second pair arrived a week before a backpacking trip I was taking, so I wore them constantly that first week to break them in. That being said, these boots arrive very comfortable and any minimal breaking in I did was probably having the footbed conform to my feet a little. The second day in the backcountry I was pulling these boots on and the adhesive that holds the two halves of the tongue together ripped apart. Why isn't the tongue one piece of leather to begin with? Anyways, turns out all the stitching on the tongue of the boot is purely cosmetic and only adhesive holds it together. Had this happened in civilization I would have sent them back for a refund, but being in the backcountry for another 4 days I just threw some superglue between the pieces and mashed them back together. The glue held but had discolored the leather around that area and looks pretty bad. Overall I'm pretty displeased with Timberland, if these so-called \\"Earthkeepers\\" are actually environmentally friendly, why not stitch it together well and not use any chemical adhesives at all? Sorry Timberland, you're no longer getting my money.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Just loved this story so much, particularly the parts relayed during the war.  Just when you think you have learnt the twist in the story you find there is more to come.  A really well structured book that is a pleasure to read.  This is a must read book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes you think!  This game uses common sense plus analytics to figure out how to escape each room.  I can't wait for another set of rooms!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|I had been recommended this book by a friend and by my southern lit professor. It is a great read. Grabs attention in the beginning and is interesting throughout. I would certainly recommend it to others.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|What a beautiful story. It makes me think. Beautifully written, powerful messages, incredible parallels to God, life and time. Will read again and again.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This book is a dastardly tale that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the telling. The end is reasonably satisfying and leads me on to future tales.<br />Gary Haddock
1400052181|5.0|Fantastic! So informational and full of unknown facts.  Everyone in America should know about this woman as her cells have literally affected us all.
B008602KQI|4.0|The author of the hunger games worked on the movie. Therefore the movie was her vision of the book. Read the series and watch the series. Totally worth it. Great movie
B004P1JEXE|4.0|found the book a little slow. nice to have new narrator's but some i found a bit pointless and boring. the end thankfully gave a bit of spice back.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The book was wonderfully descriptive, yet in some cases a bit too descriptive. I wonderful read that will take you on many ups and downs as you take this life altering adventure with Pi. The middle gets a little bit dry, but hang in there, the end will surprise you!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game! I just wish there was more levels very addicting didn't even need to use cheats<br />Needs more levels
B000P0J09C|3.0|i like this movie its funny but not at the same time war is not funny but they did a nice job to add funny bits to it.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|u get to do more things a different story every thing is AWSOME COOL And FUN u need to get it
B002NZK5TG|4.0|Bought for youngest daughter.<br /><br />She watches it over & over & over again.<br /><br />At least 2 or 3 times a week.<br /><br />Obviously she likes it.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|the card is just what i looking for it was very hard to find a card here in florida, but just go to amazon.com thank you;
1883217040|5.0|Definitely wanted to learn the theory that I knew this book provides so I'm looking forward to getting stuck into it!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Downloaded app and opened it and was immediately totally annoyed by the music. Whats worse I couldn't mute it . Not a option as far as I could tell. This game is not one that I can recommend.
0061978078|2.0|We heard the first book, Delirium, as audiobook from local library..Good action and a weird world situation. So enough interest we purchase book 2 and 3..Not much going on in either book, lots of teen dramas about it. The action never leads to any understanding of why the USA has gone to the dark side.  A lot of story which for me was not very interesting.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Love all seasons of Fringe - fascinating- all about science fiction that is based on things currently being confirmed as REAL.  Watch THROUGH THE WORMWHOLE on the science channel for confirmation.  Great cast - well done.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This is a great game.  There is some cartoon violence but its pretty tame.  One of the best free games i have seen so far.  Great job!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Mah jongg is a simple puzzle game with several playing levels. It is suitable for both novices and good players.  I enjoy a game or two just before I turn out the lights for the night.<br /><br />What I don't like is this review. I have submitted my opinion no fewer than 7 times, and have been told to resubmit each time.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|My title pretty much completely explains how I feel about this game. It is simple and mindless because all you do is push two buttons: gas and brake. The goal of the game is to drive as far as possible in a vehicle that you can upgrade, and not flip over and kill the creepy looking driver. If you do flip over the car and smash the driver you hear a neck cracking sound.  If this game cost money I would probably recommend that you don't buy it because it is not a very exciting game and doesn't make you think. But because it is free my words of wisdom to a potential downloader is this: go ahead and try it because while it is not completely awesome it is ok.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Seems too easy at first but gets more and more difficult! To the point where it seems impossible! But don't use the hint because it's your only one! You'll have to purchase more if you need another one! (That's why only 4 stars). Just keep trying all available moves and you will figure it out!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I couldn't be more pleased on this app. It is so simple to use and so easy to use without wearing my glasses. I recommend it to everyone who uses calculators often. I Love it!
1451695195|5.0|This sort of first hand account of a glimpse into who we &#34;really are&#34; is the kind of thing that gives me more reassurance, acceptance and peace about what comes after death when so many of us are afraid of it than any religious teaching ever has.  I think it should be a must-read, and I've seen several of his interviews.  The &#34;heaven&#34; he refers to isn't specific to any particular religion or divinity figure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book. It kept me hooked from page 1. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants a fun read.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|This movie is hella' badass man! me and my friends wish that kind of stuff would happen to us but with how the ending ended up none of us wanna die lol.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I got the app for out of town use. Haven't even had to use it. I wake up before the alarm goes off.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|i love this movie as much as i love the book! I just love how i know there are people like me out there.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|this is the worst game I've. ever played. it looks nothing like the picture,  the controls are horrible,  and after playing the free version I can't believe they expect people to buy the full version I can't understand why this game has four and a half stars it blows my mind
B00A83075M|5.0|this movie is my top favorite cartoon! I know i'm 24 but i'm a kid at heart and you can't help but not get all emotional there in the end. I love it :-D
0307742997|3.0|The Snowman has an interesting premise and delivers excitement, but unfortunately it also has several critical flaws. The writing techniques of Joe Nesbo are rather conspicuous, and at times it feels like the reader is being jerked around unnecessarily--and worse the reader is aware of it. The  narration is extremely shoddy, as often the perspective shifts between characters without any demarcation or a critical detail is left out of an otherwise omniscient voice. For instance the character will be talking to someone that the reader recognizes as another character, yet the narration will fail to define who it is. I found this very hokey and far from engaging.<br />Nesbo seems much more interested in tugging the reader in every thriller-which-way at the cost of developing characters. By the time the climax was reached, I realized I didn't care that much.<br />All this being said, it does read well and has some exciting albeit sadistic scenes. If you find it in on the bookshelf of your vacation house and have nothing better to do, go ahead and give it a read I guess.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much,<br /><br />The book takes a simple man who reaches a point in his life where he seeks to understand himself. All these other people try to follow him, be him or use him. In the end, each person has to choose their own way. You can't choose what worked for someone else.<br /><br />great, thoughtful and really well written, gives you something to think about
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|Buddy Guy never disappoints....excellent bluesman!  I am hopeful that I will have the pleasure of seeing more of his concerts.  I also very hopeful that i will be able to visit LEGENDS in Chicago one day soon!
B00CW665VI|4.0|Had so much fun with this book.  For one: its the male perspective....you know we love to get in those guys heads.  For two: dude has some serious dedication, and you have to love that.  Great blend of humor and tension and steaminess going on in these pages!  If you want a book that will make you feel and make you laugh and root for the characters in their endeavors, this is the book for you.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I cannot wear earbuds. They won't stay in my ears. The large round headsets that cover the ears do not stay on my head. This is the only thing that works.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A novel with heart - interesting characters - and an unpredictable always compelling plot.  A beautiful rich novel for readers who love great fiction.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|A lot has been written over the years about the Eagles, their fights, partying, break-up in 1980.  Now we get to hear it from the members themselves.  It is nice to hear observations from producers and friends along the way, particularly Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Brown, JD Souther and Bob Seeger as well as Glyn Johns and Bill Szymczyk.  I always loved the Eagles music and especially the work they did with Joe Walsh.  The documentary heavily focuses on the recollections and opinions of Don Henley and Glen Frey.  It would have been nice to hear more from the rest of the band, especially Randy Meisner , Bernie Leadon, Don Felder and Joe Walsh.  After hearing Glen Frey's unapologetic description of Don Felder and his remarks about others in the band, I was left feeling like he doesn't realize the contribution Felder, Meisner, Walsh and Leadon made to the Eagles sound, along with the great songs they brought to the table.  Seems Glen figures he would have been just as successful without them. Enough about Glen Frey!  The Concert disc from the Capitol Centre is great!  Looks like the guy's were really having a good time in 1977.  That's the way I want to remember the Eagles.
B003M696QS|4.0|Pim van Lommel is an archetype of this genre. If you have an interest in this curious subject, this book is a good place to begin your journey.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is very addicting. Well designed levels that start off easy to learn a new monster and then get harder. Graphics are really good. Music can get a little old after awhile but no biggie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game to challenge your mind, it can be difficult at times, especially when your are trying to figure out the clues. You will love it if you like hidden object games.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I'm shocked...perplexed even that Kanye could release \\"this\\" as his latest album. To be clear, I have liked Kanye's albums since The College Dropout and I have been amazed at his progression from one album to the next. Being an extremely talented producer allows him to layer tracks in a very satisfying fashion and his constant evolution, vocals and production, has been nothing short of extraordinary. All of this culminated in the masterpiece that is My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. I still listen to that album to this very day....and then this happens. Whatever the hell this is. I strongly recommend everyone, including hardcore Kanye fans, to preview this album before purchase.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and at times very challenging! If you enjoy being challenged and solving problems and finding hidden clues, then this is a great game for you! I love,love,love it!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman does not disappoint in this new book. Though disturbing at times, it was also relentlessly intriguing. A myth for the older reader to fall into. The strong characters draw you in and the story mesmerizes. You will find yourself reading just a little more at midnight, just a little more at 1AM. Hard to put down and worth the time. Read this. You won't regret it.
B001BANK32|5.0|Stephen King is one of my favorite authors. The shining is one of my favorites. I've read it quite a few times, and it<br />still gives me the shivers.

159463176X|5.0|All I can say is wow! I love Hosseini's work. I've been a fan ever since I read Splendid Suns. This books is just as well-written as the others. If you are looking for a serious read, this is the book for you.

B00D1DBO1C|5.0|This one works better than the paid version.  I got that one first based on the recommendation of an Amazon AppStore Rep, but I should have tried this one first.  Not many differences between the two, in my opinion.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is fun but I'm stuck on level four so can somebody please help me? I would be very grateful. I can't get the key out of the hole.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|I love Lilo and Stitch! It is a great movie! The picture quality is great, and so is the sound!
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|\\"Kveikur\\" is yet another phenomenal offering from Iceland's Sigur Rós, one that both incorporates the elements that have become the group's signature--Jónsi's distinct voice and incredible range, the lush, cinematic expanses of their music--and demonstrates a willingness to explore new territory. There's a grittier, darker feel to \\"Kveikur,\\" yet the record is no less beautiful for it.<br /><br />Sigur Rós aren't aping their Scottish colleagues Mogwai or borrowing from another source, this shadowy energy is very much their own--when describing the record to friends, I have called \\"Kveikur\\" a darker cousin of \\"().\\" It's a generalization that doesn't touch upon the uniqueness of \\"Kveikur,\\" though my friends know that despite the gorgeous outings that have followed \\"(),\\" that record is my favorite, not only for its incredible craftsmanship, but due to the album being the soundtrack to a formative part of my life.<br /><br />If you are a longtime Sigur Rós fan, \\"Kveikur\\" is a brilliant continuation of the band's phenomenal oeuvre. More than that, it finds the band not only venturing off into new waters, but feeding and thriving off this new energy. And if \\"Kveikur\\" will be your first Sigur Rós album, it's a wonderful place to start. My only advice: don't stop here.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This has got to be the most boring movie I have ever watched.<br />James Franco can't act.  He may be well educated but he still<br />is boring.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|The app itself isn't bad. Cute graphics. Some educational value. The problem I have with it is the cost of the treasure chests. The majority of them cost 5 pearls...at least at this point for me, yet it's very difficult to earn enough pearls to be able to open the chests. Rarely one comes that you can open for free.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is really fun but need more than 8 levels. As soon as you think you're getting in the groove of the game it's over. BUMMERS!!!
B004OBQDHK|1.0|The disk would not play in my mac, just kept rejecting itself, so I can not rate this.  Any ideas?
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|Usually I run music in the background when working, but a friend recommended this ambient noise app and I've found it is very useful for times when I need to concentrate on the task at hand but have some background noise going on. Really easy to use, and there are a lot of great free plugins to choose from as well.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really didn't have a clue that this game would be so intricate with its story plot and corresponding tasks, events, rewards, treasure, etc, and while it may be very interesting, the anticipation is built for so long that explanations are lost. For instance, why am I collecting a pirate's map only to later go to outer space. Or why the house has a force field of kinetic energy that's strong enough to move things about. But if you focus on the game alone, I would have to give it a A- for its entertaining distractions from the plots holes.
B00003CXA6|2.0|It was with great anticipation I bought this movie based on the wonderful reviews.  I thought this might be an attempt to follow after the great \\"How The West Was Won\\" but it fell far short.  Poor directing, poor acting (director's fault), very poor script, disjointed story, etc.  The music was its only saving grace and even it got a little monotonous after a while, probably because the rest of it was so poor.  You'll get through it but I doubt you'll ever watch it again.
B005XE33FM|4.0|This album covers songs from Soundgarden, Audioslave and Chiris Cornells solo albums. Also covers of Led Zeppelin and John Lenin.
B000SEGQNS|5.0|Fast read that keeps or puts you on the right track for design and usability.  All the things you would think that you know but often get over looked or forgotten.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I like the real time workouts.  I also like that there are options for toning different areas.  It allows for mixing and matching.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|It was fun watching, you will fall in love with all the characters.  A nice change from American tv shows.
B008CWD17M|2.0|I suppose this album is enjoyable to many other ASIA fans  (as suggested by the quantity of existing positive reviews here)  -- but, to me, it is rather disappointing.    The previous two reunion albums were each 3+ star albums overall.  Each contained a handful of high quality ASIA-worthy melodic Rock tracks  mixed in with a bunch of flaccid Wetton-solo-style material.    For each of those two albums, I could piece together enough tracks  to assemble two separate high quality half-hour ASIA \\"albums\\".    Unfortunately, this album only provides two (maybe three) really good songs--  and the rest of the material drops off considerably and seems to plod along.    Of all the ASIA albums that I have listened to (numerous times),  I think I have to rank this one near the bottom overall.    Asia  Alpha  Astra  Phoenix  Arena  Aura  Omega  Aqua  XXX  Aria  Gravitas    I doubt my opinion here will ever sway anyone's decision to purchase this album or not... but what the heck, right?  Proceed with caution.  Maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is truly amazing. Very addictive. I love the graphics. When I start playing it is hard to put down. Flying the balloon is the best.
B002OSXDAU|4.0|I read this in the early 60's. It was the first Ayn Rand book I ever read and it prompted me to read all her books. Lately, I have been rereading them.  The Fountainhead holds up today as well as it did when written in the 1940's.  But then, principles don't change, and Howard Rourke is a very principled character. As well, slimy characters have always been around and Toomey is as slimy today as when Ayn Rand created him.
0316247545|4.0|I bought this for my daughter's birthday - and she absolutely LOVES it! The book is fantastic for a My Little Pony fan, and my daughter had read through it a couple of times during a short week. The only downside? The pages have already begun to fall out... We've only had the book for a couple of weeks, my daughter has not been rough with the book, no tears or folds, and yet the pages have just begun to come unglued from the binding - leaving us with a copy that has several sheets stuffed back in. Very unfortunate for such a wonderful book that I know my daughter would have enjoyed for several years. I will be returning the book for another to see if the copy we had was simply defective. The only reason it didn't get five stars was for the defective binding.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but it does not live up to the wonderful predecessors, Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. The model is the same, separated loved ones find each other when it is too late. Well done, but predictable.  All that said, I will keep coming back when Hosseini writes another.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Before I bought the book, I read the reviews and was a little cautious when starting this one--everyone seems to hate it.<br /><br />I can understand why so many fans would be upset...this was supposed to be a trilogy (at least that was my understanding) And now it will be spanned across a couple more books. Out of curiosity, let's all admit, that we will be finishing the series because we have to see how it ends.<br /><br />Day's writing is consistent with the other novels, her characters are constantly growing. It's a good read--and I'm looking forward to the next 2 installments. Don't be so disheartened by the negative reviews! If you really love the Eva/Gideon romance, you won't be terribly disappointed.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend and I finally read it a year later. Wow, why did I wait? Once I started, I could not put it down.  It addresses nature vs nurture, as well as how far a parent will go to protect a child.  Gripping! And in the end, you are left to draw your own conclusions, but not in a disappointing way. Rather, in a &#34;something to think about&#34; way. Loved it!
0698118308|4.0|This is a perfect book for the very young reader.  In true Eric Carle fashion, the text and illustrations are seamless and it conveys such wonderful feelings about an old fashion pastime of watching the clouds go by.  This sis a great book for a weather unit for very young learners.  Love it.
B00C2C637I|5.0|This is one of the most insidiously scary books I've ever read...a well-crafted, literate, supernatural horror story that could have inspired Stephen King. The images are so vivid that it was like watching it unfold on film. It haunted me for days. Just found out there was a film made in 1983, and the screenplay was written by Ray Bradbury.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I usually end up using this app on a daily basis, very handy indeed. Quicker & easier than turning on the TV to the weatherchannel

B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game but it would be great if you didn't have to depend on invest papers for so many aspects of the game.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I bought the book because I loved the movie and wanted to know a little more about the characters.<br />The story is a bit different, but it is good. Specially for us who like books that give us hope.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Basically if you get bored this game is great, but you have to have a ton of ovens...sucks that most of the fun food takes hours to \\"cook\\" but still entertaining
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've been playing for quite some time. And being an actual horse owner, this game is very realistic! I love it!!

B003L77FYS|5.0|hello,<br />  we are castle fans and love the series.  all of the regulars interact with each other quite well.  the story lines from their pasts take up most of the season.  but, the thing that keeps the series going is watching the relationships between castle's family.  the &#34;gran&#34; is a character and the daughter is nearly perfect.  castle still learns from both.  it is enjoyable watching the continuing growing relationship between castle and beckett.  great series and shows...
B0030B0S2Q|5.0|While it can be slow in parts, it is a great story about how solitude can have an impact on one man and how those circumstances can draw strength.  I think one of Sam's best performances.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Grandson loves Ice Age but this was a bit too difficult for him.  Should have read age group for this product.
B000SW2ER2|2.0|I was hoping this would be more of a sifi type movie, but instead it is just a psycho thriller that takes place on a space station, disappointing.
B00CU8OVIM|4.0|Note:This review is based on the regular album version<br /><br />This album is a right step on the road to greatness for Cole. He seems to be comfortable with himself as an artist and not trying to force himself to making certain type of songs. This album is well produced and entirely produced by him. He varies the subject matter fairly decent and to me did not waste much space with obvious filler. Cole is not the most natural charismatic rapper but he held my attention for the most part the whole album. Hope he stays on this path.<br /><br />Hotep.
B0026Q8EWW|4.0|This is a good adaptation of the book.  It is one of Matt's earlier movies and he still has that youthful confused look that really translates into the character that is 'over his head'
1609611543|5.0|54 year old male with head to toe joint pain, muscle aches and a moderate amount of arthritis.  My sugar levels were getting too high and there was this chronic brain fog that would never go away.  I was grazing on wheat, rice and corn and drinking lots of apple juice from dawn to dusk.  My energy and alertness levels and my mood swings looked an EKG.  I was driving my wife and coworkers batty.  Actually it was a very subtle form of substance abuse.  The more I tried to control my moods and alertness by what I ate the more out of control I became.<br /><br />6 weeks ago I got rid of wheat, corn, fruit juices, most rice and added sugar products....and I started loosing 2 pounds a week.  6 weeks before that I had given up on bread and milk, (some cheese in moderation is OK for me).  I have kept my diet balanced and found new sources of carbs.  My meat intake is modest and I am refusing to turn this into another form of the Atkins diet.  Carbs in the right form and in the right amount are my friend and not my enemy.  I am very physically active, with a very physically demanding job.<br /><br />The weight is falling off and I don't feel the least bit pinched or deprived.  The first couple of weeks were hard....there was a burning desire for sugar in any form I could find it.  And I had to learn new ways to shop for and prepare food.  But after 6 weeks it's getting easy. Sugar was part of the problem and there was a withdrawal period.  I had to ride those cravings out.<br /><br />My full body joint and muscle aches have vanished.  My arthritis has been cut by more than half.  My resting pulse rate has dropped 10 beats per minute.  The brain fog is going away and I can concentrate again.  Moods swings area leveling out.  And this is only the start of the 7th week!
B00BLF9FOK|3.0|At first glance, Kim Jee-Woon's \\"The Last Stand\\" feels a bit like a pity-flick handed to the aging Arnold Schwarzenegger for all his years of service to the industry (not to mention the state of California). Yet, the movie is so happy-go-lucky in its tone and so shamelessly brazen in its goofiness that the viewer actually has a hard time disliking it.<br /><br />Andrew Knauer's rather astonishing everything-but-the-kitchen-sink screenplay features the former governor as the bone-creaking sheriff of a sleepy Arizona border town who's job it becomes to prevent an escaped convict in a turbo-charged race car from using his town as a crossing point into Mexico - something the FBI itself proves incapable of doing.<br /><br />The film seems to exist in two completely separate spheres simultaneously - which is both its biggest charm and its greatest drawback. The sheriff leads a team of bumbling cops and petty criminals - who quite literally can't shoot straight - straight into the eye-teeth of a band of high-tech, take-no-prisoners, armed-to-the-teeth bad guys whose utter ruthlessness makes the Corleone family look like the Waltons. This results in a rather uncomfortable mix of uber-violent action sequences and Keystone Kop buffoonery. The effect is not unlike what one would get if Walter White and Jesse Pinkman were portrayed by Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble. Yet, somehow, at certain moments at least, the crazy thing kind of works, and the audience can't help pulling for it, especially when the movie itself seems as much of a scruffy underdog as the sheriff and his ragtag underlings.<br /><br />Ah well, at least the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and the full-speed-ahead action rarely lets up.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|It was a 'can't put down' book.  Really need the next book ASAP.  Will tell my friends to buy it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is great..... I play it all the time... great game.... get it if u can..... I think I like it so much because my horse in the game looks a lot like my real horse that I loved that we sold...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wasn't sure about this game when I downloaded it,  but have been pleasantly surprised.  I am enjoying this game immensely and it works well on my kindle.  Wonderful surprise to find this fun game.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|A family classic! Julie Andrews is so fabulous and the story is timeless. Of course, the music is also wonderful--musical lovers, this is one of the great ones. The color and detail in the film is also impressive--and we didn't even watch the HD version!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so fun! It keeps you busy, and it's very challenging. I wish there were more levels! More levels are coming soon, so overall, this is a great game for everyone.
B005544V6A|5.0|I originally tuned in to this show because I like legal procedurals like &#34;The Practice&#34; and &#34;Boston Legal&#34; -- although I've never seen an episode of any &#34;Law and Order&#34; or &#34;Ally McBeal.&#34;  This is very much in the Shonda Rimes school in that it is dialogue-driven and fast-paced.  I liked the concept of how the two lead characters came together and was interested in seeing how their relationship played out and if they ever get caught (no spoiler; watch the first episode to learn their secret).  But I kept coming back primarily because of Rick Hoffman's character, Louis Litt.  He is just incredible and so much fun to watch!  He really breathes life into the characters he plays, and Louis is gonna be a classic.  See more of him (and others, like Donna and Jessica) in season two.<br /><br />The reason I watch this show isn't the legal cases.  They are entirely secondary to the characters and basically just provide a reason for them to interact, because these people would probably never be in the same room together otherwise!
0143120581|4.0|I am similar to the husband in the book, Jed. and I struggle with my wife's treatment of my children. My Chinese wife is authoritative and often times harsh. However, the writing is clear, concise and often witty. It is both a serious and a self-deprecating biography of both her successes and failures as a Mother. I can only hope that my wife will also relent at some point!<br /><br />If this parenting style is of interest, you should read the recent research paper published in the Journal of Asian Psychology.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers the obstacles are fun and challenging it is really fun  I think you should download this awesome
0307165485|5.0|I love this book!  My mother bought a copy for me when I was little.  I read that book to my children and they loved it.  This is the third copy I have purchased so that each of my kids have a copy for their kids. You can't miss with this one.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great story.  Very well written and keeps you guessing.  Highly recommend it for a summer read.  You won't put it down.

B004FRX0MY|5.0|I like this app better than Google Play Music.<br /><br />Easy to use with a simple interface.  This app runs perfectly on the [[ASIN:B009M4X7Z0 Acer Iconia Tab A110-07g08u 7-Inch 8 GB Tablet (Gray)]].
0240815807|5.0|Excellent read. Learned a ton. Will use as a reference for a long time. Several pages will remain dog eared.
B008OM0EDO|2.0|In my opinion Borat was novel and funny, Bruno was also funny but The Dictator is not that funny.<br />Granted that if you are new to Sacha Barron Cohensque comedy you may like this movie more than I did (I would still recommend that other two). The jokes were too cliche and the laughter seemed forced!
B004XQO8JG|5.0|I know a lot of Sly's movies are cliched, but he in my opinion, is the best action star of this genre.  If you like Sly you will like this movie.  It was originally the script for Beverly Hills Cop, but producers thought that it was to violent.  Damn straight it is, but thats whats great about it.  It is a/n 80's action film, not some CGI'd crapfest, give it a view and you will love it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The bundle was a great buy. Plus, I love shopping from the comfort of my home. The books (so far) are fantastic and I have a hard time putting it down. I'm very happy with my purchase.
B0080BFVPU|5.0|When I first seen this movie I instantly thought that this is one of those cult classics that will be remembered.  The movie flows well, and John and Minnie are awesome together.  The soundtrack is 80's inspired, and really takes me back to when MTV just started to open it's infant eyes.  The action on top of the comedy just makes this great.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|1. Takes a few listens--the sum is greater than the parts, like OK Computer<br />2. Martin's description that it is a cross b/w Violator and SOFD is also accurate--it has the bluesy songs of the latter and the synths/guitars of the former, with a modern dash of syncopation/dubstep.<br />3. The songs are fresh and vibrant, the production stellar.  It is consistently good rather than some great, some mediocre like Exciter or SOTU.<br />4. The band clearly made a choice to avoid a pop production on songs like welcome to my world and angel with a lot of syncopated beats and spare instrumentation, but unlike much of the new Radiohead, the melody and song structure are still intact.  It will be interesting to see if any of the remixes have conventional production.<br />5. Dave's songs actually fit on this album.  They're still not up there with Martin's best, but he's learned to write a proper chorus.<br />6. His voice is really kicking.  He's singing confidently with a snarl.<br />7. The only pop single is \\"Soothe My Soul\\", though other standout tracks include \\"Alone\\", \\"Goodbye\\" and \\"Angel\\". \\"Heaven\\" wasn't a great lead single, but it fits on the album.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This collection is really a must-have for any hardcore Beatles fan. One of the best collections of Beatles music - aside from the original vinyls, of course!
B008N1LL42|5.0|Great movie, lots of action and good music. Love this movie, also a good family movie. Again, it's an awesome movie.
B00874T02K|5.0|It was a different workout than the EA Sports Active 2 one but just as challenging without the sensor glitches!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is awesome. Especially since the new update. However, I would like to finally be able to mine and use red stone. That would make this game complete. And, an easier way to herd animals. But other than that, two thumbs up!!
B00B29J0I6|4.0|Like other reviewers have said, this game definitely reminds me of cut the rope. Though, in this game, you're breaking crates instead of cutting ropes and putting the little guy in a box instead of a candy in a mouth. The physics are also similar. You break certain crates to cause the guy to go certain directions.<br /><br />The graphics are cute and nicely done. The sound is OK (good but not great enough for me to want to sit and listen to it for a long duration). The price of the game is good for the type of gameplay it offers (which is nice to see!). I also loved the intro video, though it made me a bit sad for the little guy!<br /><br />My only issue I've had with the game so far on my kindle fire is that it keeps popping up the trophy page. I'm not sure why it is, since I couldn't have pressed anything to even have opened it. It got a bit annoying after awhile, so I'm docking a star.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a simple, fun game to play in your spare time. If you love cut the rope, you'll love this game!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I  am  Dexter's  biggest fan, The writing on this show is like none-other.  I love where the plot has gone,seem's to me season 8,the way 7 was, has got to be the last season, and I'm very saddened by this. This is by far my favorite series. And Drop Dead Diva  is  my second favorite.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Growing up as a kid in the 60s and 70s and reading all Marvel and DC Comics, Thor was always one of my favorites.  They did an awesome job with this movie and I can continue to watch it multiple times or start anywhere in the movie.  I find something different every time I see it and the beginning with the History in Norway and how Loki became Odin's son is perfect.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome.I love it .I didn't need any help on it. It was very easy. I am going to tell my friends about this game.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The book was a good read, but it wasn't the type of book I usually read. I did finish it less than a week, which is much better than I can say for some other &#34;best sellers&#34; that I've purchased.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Definitely recommend this movie.  Comic book hero fun, good evil villain.. Well done visually.  Wish I had seen it in HD.
B000Q67DEO|5.0|A rare old school gem. This was the first album that a video album was made aswell. I'm very happy with my purchase. Every song on here is awesome.<br /><br />Dreaming - 5 stars<br />Hardest Part - 5 stars<br />Union City Blue - 5 stars<br />Shayla - 5 awesome stars<br />Beat To The Beat - 5 stars<br />Accidents Never Happen - 5 stars<br />Die Young Stay Pretty - 4 stars<br />Slow Motion - 5 stars<br />Atomic - 5 Stars<br />Sound-A-Sleep - 5 stars (puts you right to bed)<br />Victor - 5 stars<br />Livin' In The Real World - 5 stars<br /><br />Every single song is great I promis you that. I hope to see them in concert one day very very soon. Grab the concert along with this album. It is filmed at the BBC. You will not be disappointed. Great band.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Christopher Eccleston did a remarkable job as the first iteration of the new series. Billie Piper was marvelous as well. I have high hopes for the new direction, and I'll really enjoy catching up on the Doctor's adventures.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|So this is how it all started.  I like that this film is appropriate for all ages and so imaginative.  Loved the visual affects.
B006O6F932|5.0|It folds out bigger than expected, and folds back in small! (: It's way better than I thought.<br />I was scared when I read other reviews about it being flimsy and easy to break. It feels strong enough to me.<br />I suppose if you or your kid plays rough and likes to kick doll houses around or drop them from high places then this might not be strong enough for you, lol.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Great weekend movie for all ages, lots of action.  My family enjoyed it very much on movie night last Friday.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Since &#34;Friends&#34; were over i honestly thought that its not possible to produce anything funny anymore. Until my girlfriend gave me this DVD. I really wasn't sure I want to give it a try. After all, it's a story about bunch of geeks. I am so glad that I gave it a chance. It is very funny. But I do think that Jim Parsons character  makes it funny. Without his amazing performance it wouldn't be so great. I understand every 10 th word perhaps, but it's still cheers me up!
0062255657|5.0|You can tell this book was written by Neil Gaiman. You can hear it in the way he highlights detail and how his characters interact with the world. I loved this book. I got the audible version which the author reads. That was a special treat.  I will listen to this many times and recommend it to everyone.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|I have to disagree with previous reviewers who felt Daemon and Freedom were better novels. I really liked Daemon, but I thought Freedom was a little dragged out. I found Kill Decision to be full of interesting technology and terrifying predictions for the future based on current technology. Kill Decision just felt more complete and polished in my opinion. That said if you haven't read any you should read them all.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I chose a five star rating because unlike the previous reviews I had no problem with the quality of the DVDs, you should also keep in mind that I usually use my laptop to watch DVDs or my desktop monitor. For all that are wondering if there is a catch to this low low series price, I have not found one yet. Love the show! Love the girls! I definitely recommend. (:
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|jet pack joyride is the best app ever. for the first 20 min then it gets boring. most of the achivments are really hard the rest are to easy. I enjoy this app but it is not worth money. and there are no levels it's sort of an endless run. this app deserves 4.5 stars
B000B8L6LI|5.0|Have two myself and have given them out as presents. Only way I have found to get that edge that stays sharp a long time. Have had my first set forever and still works great.
B00C9U9YOW|2.0|I'm just not hearing it.  Not only am I not hearing the \\"greatness\\" in here; I'm not even hearing the \\"good\\"-ness!  I'm not coming from some left-field audience here either, I've been a huge QOTSA fan for years and count \\"Songs For the Deaf\\" and \\"Rated R\\" among my favorite and most played records.  But after two complete listens of Clockwork, I'm shocked to admit and sad to report that I like... NO songs*.  Can that even be?  I can't say I wasn't prepared to be disappointed, because ever since SFTD, I've liked each release less.  But when I read all these raves and people saying \\"their best in years,\\" I got all excited -- then, utter disappointment.  So let my review at least be a warning to other fans, and a sounding board for others who are ready to leave the bandwagon.<br /><br />It's always hard to articulate what precisely is \\"wrong,\\" but guess I'd say that, for one, the hooks just aren't there, those great chord progressions and various melodic choices within a song that make it so engaging and great.  Is Josh running out of them?  You certainly couldn't fault him, he's written his share of gems.  But the other HUGE issue, I believe, is the lack of dynamics.  A great record in this genre should feature a variey of tempos, of feels... When Nick O. was in the band, his nasty, raw cuts were a perfect counterpoint to Josh's more delicate pop-rockers, or even to Josh's heavier rockers.  Then you'd get a couple of Mark Lanegan curveballs, plus some other weirdness, and thus you have a complete and interesting finished product.<br /><br />Man, does this record EVER scream out for \\"A Song For the Dead\\" or \\"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar...\\" or \\"Tension Head\\".  Or how about \\"Little Sister\\"?  Some tempo!  Anywhere!  Sorry, Josh, I don't care how much \\"craft\\" went into the making of this, it just falls completely flat for me.<br /><br />*Okay, June 30 update: I stand by my two stars as I don't really like this record (let's call it 2.5 stars if we're being technical), but I do want to soften my stance slightly.  It's not that I think this record is terrible or anything; I don't *mind* listening to it -- and yet, it has no highlights in my opinion.  To me it features a bunch of songs that would fit fine as the filler songs on a \\"great\\" record (except \\"If I Had a Tail,\\" which I think is awful).  But again, what KILLS it is the complete lack of TEMPO!  Eeeeeverything on it is slow, whether a ballad, a poppy track, a bluesy track, or something heavier.  I can't believe Josh went that way.  I looked to QOTSA for an interesting *mix* of rock music, and the mix isn't there on this one; it's a bunch of slow- to mid-tempo (emphasis on the slow), non-threatening/\\"mature\\" adult rock songs. Meh.but I do want to soften my stance slightly.  It's not that I think this record is terrible or anything; I don't *mind* listening to it -- and yet, it has no highlights in my opinion.

B005YPJ62E|5.0|I am an Abe student and did not know how I would feel about this book. Started reading it while waiting for my daughter at the mall. I loved it so much that ordered it as audio book and CDs. The music is beautiful and so easy to listen to. One of my favorite books to help me get back in my alignment.
B000VIPJKM|5.0|cute funny and good message about how one needs to take responsibility for what she wants, to set goals and go for it.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Great inspirational book combining a beautiful real story with loads of information and research on running . Must for runners
B00CWY76CC|4.0|finished first four rooms and so far I like it...no instructions that I found but none needed..<br />play is intuitive and graphics are nice and crisp
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love the game because I can't get minecraft on laptop due to not trusting the internet in general so when I found it on kindle fire I was excited to finally try the legendary minecraft. As I first started playing I didn't dig down into ground or build anything to protect myself therefore died often. As I kept playing I realised that I should &quot;hide from the dark&quot; I advise all new players to punch a tree to death and dig down as soon as you start. The only thing that really bugged me about the game was how far behind it was compared to the other minecraft games on Xbox and laptop (I read online on how to play minecraft and got mad as hell when I learned about the nether and the end and all that jazz
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Very inventive game, not too hard to advance. Lots of fun. I like that you are able to play without having to spend money to advance levels, so many games make you spend or you will be stuck.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I love this case for my Kindle Fire HD.  My kindle feels very safe and secure and well protected.  There are 3 adjustments for both vertical and horizontal standing.  It easily switches from vertical to horizontal, trust me I know.  My 2 year old has two apps and she wants to switch between the two constantly.  One is horizontal and of course the other is vertical.  As much as I rotate the device in the case, I never feel like i'm wearing it down.  I have even felt safe letting my daughter use the kindle since it's been in this case.  I highly reccommend this case.  You can access the usb ports, volume, and on/off switches fine.  You close the case while the kindle is on and the kindle goes to the lock screen automatically.  A small elastic band keeps the case closed if needed.  The band also feels very sturdy and I'm not worried about it wearing out.  LOVE THIS CASE!!
B007ZXK08C|1.0|The characters are two dimensional and don't come across as real. The writing is just OK. The plot is unbelievable.
B00422LESE|1.0|Inspired by a greedy publisher rather than by refreshingly new ideas of a wheelchair-bound icon. Unfortunately, these kinds of popular science books (and there are just too many) distract the readership from The Next Scientific Revolution.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Sophie can tell a story that will make you laugh, cry and identify. This story focuses on our overpowering need to romanticize the beautiful and carefree individuals we were in our youth. I liked the balance of realism, fantasy and humor.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I most definitely LOVE this game. My cousins Miles and Michelle introduced this game to me. I thought this game would be some crappy suckish game but boy was I wrong!!!!! This game has great potential just like temple run but better!!! I absolutely recommend this game to EVERYONE! Trust me u won't be disappointed and even better it's FREE doesn't get better than that!!!!!!!:)
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book has a combination of plot, humor and of course hotness!!!  At first I wasn't sure I was going to like how the author had the main character Drew tell the story to use like he was talking and we are answering BUT... I not only liked it, I LOVED it!  I can't wait to read her next book!
B004QL7K70|2.0|To me, DVDs are for watching a movie you liked time and time again. I saw this in theaters and would be fine with never seeing it again. It was ok in the beginning, but the ending is terrible. The plot for this movie is terrible.
030789701X|5.0|First of all, this is my first review on Amazon so sorry if it's not a very good one.<br /><br />The book itself is great. It's full of content and I am pretty sure that everything about the game is in this guide. For a completionist gamer (like me), it's a must have. I've already beat the game once (without the add-ons), and I was pretty sure that I've beat all of the game, found all locations and completed every quest. Well, I was wrong. True, you can find most of this info for free on the internet, but it isn't very straightforward and well-written like this guide. I usually never buy guides, but for a game such as big as Skyrim it seems like a must have. Some might say the paper is a bit cheap, but I think it's fine for a book with 1100+ pages.<br /><br />Now to the bad stuff:<br />The book came to be slightly damaged. The cover corners were bent, as well as most page corners. The other thing is the map. The map is good, but the way it's connected to the book is inconvenient. It's very hard to rip out of the book without actually ripping the map. You have to be very careful not to damage the map.<br /><br />I am going to give it a 5/5 since the good things outweigh the bad on a massive scale.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Good old fun adventure- well done! Really enjoyed Spielberg's version/adaptation of the original Tin Tin. My family was reminded of Indiana Jones, but this my youngest daughter<br />At age 4 was able to enjoy with us!
B0054YHB8Q|5.0|Loved Boston then and still do.  always crank the radio when i hear the music and the voice.  Boston's sound was/is so distinct and recognizable.  They were my first rock album and always take me back when i hear them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love this game!!  I played 100 floors, but this game is so much better!!  More interactive and just more fun!
6305648522|2.0|I do not like the fact that this film has been cut.  If you have seen the real movie, this one does not make any sense.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Recommend for families with teenagers or older. Need extension if more than four people want to play. Requires a lot of learning to get started but definitely worth it!
B009D5VPTI|5.0|This is a great movie. Pixar has done it again. I would recommend this movie for a date night for the girlfriend or wife, and even for a family movie night. However I have to say that this is a phenomenal movie to watch as a mother and a daughter pair. If you want to spend some time with Mom, this is the movie to watch. Trust me on this one.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These stay on your head and in your ears. I don't know how I ran without them before. They stay out of the way and don't fall out. The sound standard, but perfect for working out!
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|This is a fun movie. I question the moral of the story, but overall if you are into video games this is a great film. It pays homage to many games and references only 80's-90's gamers would know. It is also a good watch for the family if a bit mature.
B006OV7S1I|2.0|The acting was OK. Not impressive because there was no depth to the character.<br /><br />Let's also just say, time is relitive to this editor, because it's all over the place.<br /><br />Olsen is a beautiful girl, and I was disapointed in the lack of her personality.
B00BF124PC|5.0|If you are looking for crazy action sequences and heroic over the top protagonists this isn't the movie for you.<br /><br />This is a thinkers thriller. The movies first scenes are violent and inhumane, and depict things that we would try to forget were sanctioned by our government, but these things happened, and the led to the end of the largest manhunt in history. This movie explores on analysts battle to find Osama Bin Laden. It shows the political and physical danger our clandestine service men and women go through everyday. It even explores objects of tradecraft used to collect the data that they do. Whether its drones, torture, or active intelligence gathering. This is a must watch drama that will have to really thinking.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|LOVE IT super awesome game very addicting and fun I would recommend this to anybody that is looking for quick fun gameplay
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I love this app!  I am handicapped, but still able to perform much of the workout.  I love how you can set the time of your workout and the ability to target specific areas of the body to work on, or the whole body workout.  I have recommended this app to several friends already!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game but short. more levels needed. some levels were challenging puzzles but fun. game could be longer and more challenging.
0446556750|5.0|Michael Connelly has lived up to his high level of quality writing in this contribution to the Lincoln Lawyer series. There is just enough of the anti-hero characterization of the main character, Mickey Haller, to appreciate the complexities of his personal life as a backdrop to compelling courtroom scenes. So far I have read each one of Connelly's novels. I did not necessarily think Connelly's compelling police series following the exploits of detective Harry Bosch would carry over into the legal field. However, I cannot help but admire each character on their own merits. Thus, I give The Reversal my top rating.
B008MM9630|3.0|The graphics are cute in this game. I don't think I get all of the challenges. Yes eventually you do end up wanting to spend money but usually we do for any game we really like.
B00D8WJ9JK|4.0|Honestly when I first heard it I didn't love it but as I listened deeper everyday since it's release it has gotten better and I always find something new to love about it lyrics and construction and coles humility is a beautiful mix
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great fun can't wait for more rooms love it could play for hours hope New rooms are just as fun
B000SEGQNS|3.0|This book is on many 'must read' books for web designers, and could be considered a 'classic' in its genre... Problem is, it's classic enough that much of the info is old.  While there are many good nuggets of information, the dated references to websites becomes distracting.
1439170916|5.0|great book. fantastic information written in a most eloquent format. a must read for anyone interested in cancer. year yeah
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its so awesome u should get it there's new update and we mite be able to play online soon .
145210655X|5.0|My son is a true Star Wars fan and has so many toys, costumes and books.  This is one of his favorites, so funny!  He goes back to reading it over and over again.
0425263924|5.0|If you love anything by Sylvia Day you'll love this also.  I love these stories with Gideon Cross!  I got this book last week and I've already read almost half of it.  I can't seem to put it down once I start to read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoy this game!  I love puzzle games and this is one of the best.  Can't wait for more rooms to be available.
B00459EZLW|4.0|Season two was much better then season 1. They stopped with all the character development and started exploring planets again. In fact the end of season two is actually pretty good and I am sad that the show was canceled.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is fun for both me and my 7 yr old. The only downside is that it uses a lot of battery!
B002UWH8P6|1.0|The title says it all. No aliens for the first 15ish episodes they don't go through the Stargate again until episode 6? They focused way to much on character development and it is a really bad show.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This game is super cool you can customize your monkey and with a bunch of hats and cool stuff. If you like boxing this is a must buy
1603425381|4.0|You will find any type of crochet border at your finger tips.  This book contains many unique and unusual designs. Each pattern is complete on one page with the color photo and stitch chart on the opposite page.  You will also find a chart stitch key and stitch glossary in the back.  You will definitely find a border suitable to your particular project.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I like Hosseini's way of writing. He is a great writer. I would therefore recommend this book. peas out :)
1402786360|5.0|I got this book as a gift for my mother, little did I know it came with so many cool ideas, and delicious desserts that everyone wanted to make! The recipes in the book are delicious, The salted caramel cupcakes are an absolute must. If you ever need a buttercream recipe this is the book to use! Everything in this book looks delicious, and so far tastes amazing. Such a good gift, especially for the bakers in any household!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I updated my game an  the pin  Octavia was movie  th  the Cantrell  town. So I wen  to inventory to accept her. I did and now rather than having  on  Octavia at full stars I have sixty with no stars.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|Awful. A rip off of Toca Boca .  It was glitchy and weird.  And slightly hard to control.  I wouldn't get this app.  Just buy Toca Boca!  It is way better.
B004S49YEM|5.0|Ken Follett is a great storyteller and this is one of his earlier works but a classic. It is a great read with suspense and fiction woven around historical facts with typical KF style that educates and entertains.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Have really gotten caught up in this story, can't wait for the next book to come out. Wish it was sooner than 2015.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|It's an awesome app. You can mess with songs, make the singer have a high pitched voice. You make them have a deep voice or you can mess with the sound. It's really cool!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is very easy to look up scriptures. The format was great. Very user friendly.<br />I highly recommend this app.
1451683405|4.0|Yes, an illusion in light of broader understanding of brain function.  Good summary information of the subject, but needs more info.  This is a short summary of the subject and a good analysis of the issue.  Possibly too heavy on the deterministic side of things in light of human behavior.  A worthwhile read to get into the subject, but further reading needed to assess Harris' point of view.  Undercuts much of religions attempt to establish free will as a basis for dealing with evil and suffering.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|It is easy to access the different genres and it remembers the songs that you listen to.  I would highly recommend this app.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Fallen Tree has produced another combination of logic and beauty in this game. Absorbing and just tricky enough to propel you on.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The app is awesome u are mad because there is no update mojang is busy with Xbox and computer it probably hard to update I have the update 7.1 on my kindle so why say they suck it won't download I don't know if that is the problem I did fix that though get what u get don't be a pile of s***  It is ok but not to the latest version
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I'm a real fan of Downtown Abbey and miss it. I thought I'd give this a shot and it's worth the time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had heard about this book on talk radio.  The gals there loved it and I did too.  I was not disappointed.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Like it. Kids enjoy the matching. Helps one concentrate.  Colorful do not care for background music. Good feature is that music is optional.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really liked this book. It really kept my interest and I looked forward to reading it every day.  I recommend it.
0920668364|5.0|I used to read this book to my son when he was a baby, 24 years ago. I bought it for my cousin who recently had a little boy. It's beautiful and I still recite it for my son.
B00BIRRDZ4|5.0|These guys are filling my long-standing need for an Eagles replacement.  No, they are not quite the same, but they leave me a peaceful, easy feeling much like the old guys.  Love this album (as well as the last one).  Strongly encourage you to check it out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game will keep you occupied! When you get out of one room, you enter the next which makes you curious enough to continue! Fun
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|A GREAT disappointment. There was nothing for adults or children here. The CG were often weak, and the story line was sub-par. How Disney allowed this to be produced after their \\"Pirates\\" series just boggles the mind. Save your money. I'm glad I didn't pay theater prices to see this garbage!
B003Y7PM3Q|5.0|The catch line from the ostensible 'title cut' (Mule) is an intro to one of the most hard driving, magnificent songs of the past few decades.  This is the band's first studio album and it is a scorcher.  If you love rock & roll, you must have this.
B00B2LRK7W|5.0|if you like hatebreed you know what you get with them, this is way better than previous record, more hardcore again.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Continuous fun,  keeps you thinking while having fun, challenging enough to keep your interest but not frustrate you actually want to purchase
B007HACDLK|4.0|well written and proves Lord Acton staAbsolute power corrupts look at congress/president of u.s.a.statement true.sorry that the author just died of cancer
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|Really strong showing from Sigur Ros. If you're at all on the line about this one, I recommend taking the leap. Super dope.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|This is a great game, often hard to put down and not play &quot;just one more&quot;.  If you're going to play though, you must be prepared to cough up some real cash because you won't get far without buying characters.
1582701709|1.0|Positive thinking is a good thing... Most people will agree with that.<br />Delusion on the other hand is an illness. One we should all hope to never have.<br /><br />What this book sells is delusion to the unintelligent. If that offends the staunch believers of this book i apologize... Just ignore me, think positive thoughts and banish what you just read.<br /><br />For the rest of us, please spend your time reading something more productive. There are several more helpful books out there. This one is snake oil on steroids.<br /><br />Have a positive day will you?
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Great product. Just what Mom wanted to get to hard to reach spaces. Worth twice the price. Get one now!
0307266303|5.0|A must have for runners from beginner to professional. This group of runners show what having a Love for running is all about. They do it because &#34;its there&#34;.
B0041KBWM0|3.0|This movie was OK. i was getting into the movie, but when the character Franck show up, i kind of got lost, i didn't see the point of this character. The story wasn't that interesting to me, all the movie play around one main character Emma, a movie is more interesting when there is more then one main character. so i give this movie 3 stars.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the best game ever....love love love it. It reminds me of the movie that had a box into pain.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|What can I say. It works. The wife uses it for her phone and iPad 2. I can't get into technical details, but it's obvious that some chargers take longer that others to charge the Anker up completely.
0143036424|4.0|I was quite drawn into the plot of this book, finding it initially fairly realistic based on the provocation provided.  In Absaroka County, someone is taking revenge on four white young men who raped a teenage Native American girl with fetal alcohol syndrome.  Though it is several years after the event and the trial, and the men's sentences have been served, someone has not forgotten this horrendous crime and is shooting these men one by one.<br /><br />Of course, this is a work of fiction and so Craig makes the plot more dramatic and offers more suspects, motives, and impressive action rather than simply having the killings be a case of revenge by a member of the girl's tribe.  While the story becomes more complex as a result, it also loses its realism and becomes a tad farfetched in some areas.  The biggest problem for me is how the killer seems omniscient, knowing where to find the victims and get set up to shoot them in the vast wilderness of Wyoming; after all, two of the murders take place nowhere near civilization.<br /><br />While I thought the story was good, and well told, I felt there was too much \\"stuff\\" surrounding it.  There was too much of Walt's thinking, too much description in too many situations (particularly of unimportant places and people), and too much hokey dialogue between Walt and Henry.  Some scenes, such as the one in which Walt must get help on the mountain in a blizzard, go on for too long.  I guess my personal preferences don't include Native American mysticism, so I wearied of those long sections also.<br /><br />Craig is a more than competent writer, which offsets his tendency to go into overdrive with description and mysticism.  He does have an awkward way with dialogue, however, that is annoying.  He intersperses so much expository \\"stuff\\" into a conversation that at times one loses the thread of who is saying what.<br /><br />Two other inconsistencies bothered me with regard to plot.  Craig made Longmire too well read for a sheriff in Wyoming.  I don't buy Longmire's literary references in conversation or in his thoughts.  Also, Longmire was supposed to be in a depression since his wife died four years previous to this story, but toward the end of the book we learn they didn't have a very close relationship--that they more or less tolerated each other for the sake of their daughter Cody, hence a depression lasting so long seems unlikely.<br /><br />I found that it took me a long time to read this book.  At times I was very involved in the story, and other times it was real work to continue reading it.  Frankly, I think the TV show is more interesting than the first book.  I will have to see what the rest of the series offers.<br /><br />For more mystery series that may entertain you, check out my website describing and reviewing many series (see my Amazon profile for the URL).
B00136NUG6|5.0|Recently, I saw EW&F in concert and they put in a great performance. This collection of hits will remind me of the concert and the energy of their music.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|3 words I love it. It is my favorite game yet to come and I have a LOT of favorite games.Take my advice and buy the game it's a great price the best their is.FREE!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|l've been looking for a game like this. Find objects or clues in order to get keys that will let you out of the room. Just enough clues to keep escape from being too difficult.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game! I never get bored of it. I would definitely recommend this game....It is awesome! GET IT!!!
B00180R06I|1.0|For as long as Ive been wanting to see this and for how much of a vampire fan I am, I was let down by this.  I guess I was spoiled by Nosferatu and dont find this artsy film the least bit scary or even creepy.  The quality of the film is amazing considering what year it was made in, but this will just sit in my collection gathering dust.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|great read. great characters. will make a cool movie. i have a favorite new author to read. buy his books. just do it.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I loved his other books, but this one is just dull.  There is no real story line, and the ending falls flat.
B008N1LL42|5.0|Bought this for my Kindle Fire.  I never get tired of watching this movie and with the Kindle Fire, I can watch in bed with ear buds and not bother my husband.
0553093029|5.0|I had read this book over a decade ago, and was delighted to find it on Amazon. It is not the usual book of concept art in that it is divided into sections, each with back story not seen in the films.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|Gotye is very creative. The music goes to your inner self where it lifts you up. It makes me want to move and interpret the melodic tones that are resonating through my body.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|This movie was worth watching, though part of it was my excitement at seeing something I'd been keeping an eye on all throughout the crowdfunded development process come to fruition. It's silly, but maybe not quite as much as it should be as it is a little slow in places.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I am only on level seven but it is fun I wish I new how to get more purels so I could do my one thing to get a brain coral.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This is definitely a movie worth watching at least twice, if you don't mind something that makes you think a lot. If you DO like something that makes you think, you are in for a treat.
B009FZFONO|5.0|No spoilers, but what a great season. Totally worth the purchase. My wife even loved it. You won't believe the way it ends.
B008KP6ENE|2.0|Maybe it was something we did wrong or it was that I couldn't install to memory card. But it was too big of a file for my phone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome book!!!! Very addicting want to keep reading ....They should keep doing the sequence like the movie...fast and furious!!! Lol
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|This is such a stupid game I don't no what they dried to do in this game. It is so horrible I hate it so much. This is so dumb.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Being a music snob and a skeptic I was not sure if the buzz about Bugg was<br />legit, I bought the CD and liked it right off. Sometimes the albums you<br />instantly like can turn on you and become too \\"easy\\", there is no depth<br />on further listening. Thankfully this is not the case with this JB debut,<br />the more I hear it the more I hear in it.<br />  A number of reviews compare Mr. Bugg to early Dylan as I did on first<br />hearing this CD, but after a month of listening to it(almost every day!) I find that to be a  superficial comparison for the most part. I would describe this music as... \\"if Phil Ochs was more into the Everly Brothers and the Kinks than Woody<br />Guthrie's protest songs\\"... However you would describe this music--I would<br />call this album a true classic--this is one of the few recent releases that<br />actually deserves a full 5 stars. Favorite songs- Broken, Trouble Town and<br />almost all the rest.<br />  Let's hope that Jake, like Bob, can grow under the enormous pressure of<br />the BS media hype machine and not fizzle like so many talented young artists.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it's one of the best games ever and it's worth playing if I were you I would get this game and rate it five stars
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I enjoyed the previous books ... but this one was a disappointment.  While the storyline and writing were similar it just did not rise to the occasion. I found this stories interwoven tales to be less meaningful. I actually. Found it somewhat depressing journey.  I don't have time or energy to waste my very precious free time to be depressed and bored.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is pretty fun, it will consume a lot of time playing it... very addicting!  1 word required for review to count. thanks
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I was recommended this movie by a good friend.  I am 35 so I thought I could relate.  And of course I was expecting an outrageously hillarious movie.  Well, I am sorry but it wasn't.  It was entertaining but not that funny.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I loved this movie and I originally saw it at the theatre and told myself I need to buy that.  It is one that you have to watch a second time as you seem to miss things.  Acting was wonderful and very entertaining.  I don't have a Blu-ray player so I give my kids that disc and I keep the DVD.  This is a must see movie for all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best ever have it on all my devices. its a must have. my daughter loves it even more. she's why I got it
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I loved this movie in the theatre and I knew that I had to buy it when it came out.  I couldn't wait for it.  Talk about action and suspense, this has it.  Tom Cruise was great.  Even if you don't like him, you need to see this movie just for the twist.  It will have you on the edge of your seat.
B008JEJLWW|4.0|My 11 year old loves these shoes and the thicker tread makes them perfect for most terrain and the bottoms won't lose traction too soon.  My only beef is with Crocs sizing. Children's sizes stop at 3 then they go into a &#34;junior&#34; size for 4,5,6. However, there are only 3 or so styles in the &#34;junior&#34; sizes so to get more variety and cool styles like this pair, I was forced to buy an adult mans size and pay adult shoe prices. Irritating but the crocs work so well with my children's rare genetic skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa, and prevent blistering and accommodate bandages I am a loyal customer. The color is way cool too!
B0091REZMW|5.0|not bad.  little slow though.  did not have to purchase anything so makes it better.  if your looking for something to eat up a couple of minutes go ahead and download
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Funny Movie, great for kids, never gets old.<br />love the Mini Movies that came with it, especially the Banana one.
0930289234|5.0|This is a great graphic novel. It has violence (not too bad, though), mystery, suspense, sci fi stuff, it's all great. Amazing writing especially considering all of Alan Moore's writing is his first draft: he refuses to revise.
B008SLAXGO|5.0|My Favorite Book! Terry Richardson has done a 5-Star Magnificent job of photographing Lady Gaga at her best, her life-style her performances her family life-style! Everthing you wanted as a Little Monster is in full color and large photos, Paws Up for Terry Richardson! My delivery was very fast and complete as always by Amazon.com, thank you for your fast and complete delivery
B007EE4XKI|5.0|David Mack certainly knows his Star Trek These are all so good and I was unable to stop reading till the end
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Real good record. Heard Dave on Rockline where they played a lot of the tracks. Bought it a day or two later. Reminds me some of the mid 90's stuff. Dave has to much talent to just keep writing only thrash stuff every time out. Thankfully!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A fun game. It's great for a quick escape from reality, but it can definitely become addicting.  We are truly enjoying it and look forward to future levels.
B00013BN4S|5.0|This is a beautiful album but especially the song Boulder to Birmingham. This song transcends - her voice is pure, sweet and so very sad. The song has become my mourning anthem for my late husband. Everything else on this album is stellar - Ms. Harris has a voice of a rare songbird. Must have CD.
1449320104|5.0|Received in best quality. Reminder: It is Not a beginner or step by step learner guide. It's totally a C# dictionary. Suggest to all C# programmer or student, make it as your reference. YOU Should have 1 on your shelf.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app truly satisfies my need to distract myself and pass the time. Love it. Anyone who has kids their kids will enjoy this and the all too. I highly recommend. Please try!!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I got really bored with clocks with a red LED display, so I looked for one with a different color. I liked the blue so I bought it. It's easy to use, works fine and I have no real complaint except the brightness of the display. It puts out enough light to serve as a night light. I prefer a room that is pretty dark, so I find the light disturbing. I gave the clock to my daughter, who likes more light at night and she is quite happy with it. Before you choose an alarm clock, consider whether the additional light will be welcome or annoying. I replaced it with a green one, and it is a little less bright, but I am yearning for another red one and my daughter is eyeing the green one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is fun to play and i love it and when u play this game i think u willl like it to
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. I wish I could be Christine, she is my favorite character. I love the idea of being the damsel in distress, and being the love interest of the Phantom and the childhood friend. I feel sorry for him. I hope he found someone that will love him for who he is and not what he looks like.
0345529057|5.0|Package came before expected time, like new and better with no torn, missing, or otherwise damaged pages or binding. I only wish the package included book 5, A Dance with Dragons.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game keeps you preoccupied. I really enjoyed it. The puzzles were easy so I am hoping for a harder version, but overall it was great.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This movie is very touching. I've never seen anything like it in my life. The characters couldn't have been more fitting and perfect for the film.
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|You either love it or hate it!!  I enjoy very dry humor/silly movies.  I laughed the whole time. Very funny
B009A87X80|4.0|The item arrived within weeks.  Unfortunately, the CD was not as good as I was hoping as some of the songs were not sung as well as I expected.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this app is fun for me and my husband, we enjoy seeing who can solve the room first. Good fun and can be challenging!
1451695195|3.0|The author with his clinical background defined his experience on a scientific perspective.  His selection of words to describe this event didn't depict a clear picture in my mind.  He presents a strong voice to those medical professionals who never believed in NDE to be real.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|I bought this movie not knowing much about it. My mom told me she saw it in the 70s and really liked it. So I watched it this eve, and I liked it, I mean I liked it alot. I found the movie to be quite brilliant, and relevant for today. The underlying messages about letting technology rule our lives was thought provoking. This movie is full of symbolism. Westworld is also a hell of alot of fun to watch. The acting is really good...but Yul Brynner is stellar. Ofcourse I am a woman and MR Brynner was not only a fantastic actor, but damn the man was sexy beyond belief. James Brolin also gives a great perfomance. Westworld is the type of film that starts out quirky, and funny, then turns into, uh oh, this cannot be good. This film came out when I was a toddler...so I am really greatful it is available for my generation to view.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i think this book is awesome. i recommend this book to everyone who read any of the other books by him.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I liked the characterization.  It held my interest, even though it was kind of a sad life that he lived.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|Love story's like this. Also, anything that comes from Ireland.  Seems I've seen the movie ???  Held my interest all the way through.  At the moment, just started reading it's &#34;sequel&#34;.  Is this book true?  Sure 'sounds' like ti.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun and addictive. Great mind game. I played this game with my son and he had a blast. He got so excited when he figured out a clue that led him to his next step.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Whenever I am bored I just go on my tablet and start playing it. This is one of my favorite games :)
B000VZYPB4|1.0|I couldn't believe that a show like this could be so popular. As an engineer, I was insulted. What has happened to our Youth today that they could think this is funny.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Our seven year old Grandson, absolutely loves this game. He has to earn each game that we purchase by making his grades, etc. Thanks for making this available for his Kindle Fire.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book.  You really don't know what happened for the first 1/2 of the book and then for the second 1/2 you will go nuts trying to figure out how it's going to end.  Enjoy!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|If you like Tom Cruise, you will like Jack Reacher. Leave your sense of reason at the door and enjoy the movie. It is not a waste of time.
B006FE83U4|5.0|Gregory Peck does an incredible job portraying Atticus and the entire film is a great representation of the novel. My daughter and niece were disappointed that so much of the book was missing in the film, but you can never fit an entire novel into a few hours.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The title &#34;Flight&#34; is a double ententre. There is much, much that just a simple flight gone very bad. It is a life that has gone bad. The question in the movie is &#34;will there be any survivors?&#34;<br />An excellent film that offend some with how graphic it is. This is not a &#34;goodie two shoes&#34; film, but it does show lifestyles with a very clear lens- and they are not pretty.<br /><br />I wish that Denzel would lend his talents to a bit lighter faire so that a wider audience could celebrate his great talent.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|First time I see them live. I have a few of their albums but nothing like seeing them in concert. Truly masters of music. I really enjoyed this DVD. Highly recommended.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This movie is not for people that want \\"I wish we could have him as president again.\\" It is about the political mechanisms of that era and how Lincoln worked the system. It is not unlike other movies where \\"do or die\\" legislation has to be passed.<br /><br />Very good acting, but the movie does drag a bit and it is hard at times to understand the dialogue.
B0083V2W6I|5.0|The Quadrophenia film is must have for not only Who fans but to anyone with interest of that part of history when &#34;Mods&#34; and Rockers&#34; had their clashes and that atmosphere of uncertainty that existed in the 60's. I remember reading and hearing about it when I was a boy and this film is one of the best vehicles to at least get a small taste of how it was for young people those days.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|That pretty much sums it up!  I loved this book and plan on reading more of David Sedaris's works.  His upbringing may have been difficult for him, but it has given him much material for his books!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great book and an even better ending. Worth the read anytime and worth the price. I highly recommend you read it.
B00421IR5I|5.0|I bought this to show my French class in high school and they loved it!  Very funny and appropriate-no worrying about embarrassing scenes!  The adventures of Petit Nicolas are known to every French child-he's kind of the Dennis the Menace of the French world!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was very good however, a little disappointing compared to the other<br />Books in the series. Still a good read.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|I decided to read some of the writing that Hemingway did during that period of his life.  I thoroughly enjoyed the experience because [[ASIN:0345521315 The Paris Wife: A Novel]] gave me a context for the Sun Also Rises and provided an improved understanding of the Rises content.  I'd recommend both books to anyone.<br /><br />Wendy
1455508977|5.0|This book is really really good. As I was reading it, I didn't want to stop. The descriptions of the characters and writing is good and easy to read. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I hope to see it soon!!
B009EHDU7U|5.0|such a fun read with twists and turns kept you interested and in love with the characters. Worth the read
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I read the books and was drawn in by the story. The story is different than I was expecting, but I fell in love with the books. The movie was done really well, too. I hope the next movie is as good as the first! Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as Katniss and Lenny Kravitz is amazing too!'
145210655X|5.0|I got this for my husband for his 1st Father's Day. It made him smile! He really loved the concept.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Thought the movie was awesome, how they portrayed Superman like this, especially when it had<br />tons of special effect beauty and non stop action in almost the whole movie after the beginning<br />got off to a slow start about the planet up in space that was gonna go POOF.<br /><br />highly recommended to catch this movie while you can!! you won't surely be sorry!! =)
006114665X|5.0|It is as detailed a description of the Balkan intrigue and complexities that you will ever read. It dispells the notion that the assasination of the Archduke was an isolated incident unconnected to the 50 years of foreign policy in the Balkans.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|This movie was made after the short-lived series. I learned about the series after having seen the movie. Really like all the characters and wish Fox had been willing to stick with it. Another gem in Joss Whedon's crown.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I finished it pretty quick, but it was fun and challenging enough and now I can't wait for more levels to be added.
034554398X|4.0|I've stayed up late reading this series of books. All the characters are woven into the total setting. Interesting how the author accomplishes that. I've read all the available books at least twice now. I find more and more to appreciate about the characters' details and well-described settings, as well as the hints as to what will take place in the future. I'm hooked.
B00DBSZ6ZC|2.0|Action, blood, some story, no heart.<br />Actors not bad, but director didn't give them anything to work with.<br />Dialogue was stilted.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|Very good.  I had to go back to the beginning and read all 13 books one after the other.  It was bliss.  However, very disappointed that Sookie didn't get back with Eric.  That would have made the perfect ending for me.  Love Charlaine Harris's work.
0061537969|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful books I've read in years. It's funny, moving & unusual. Even my husband, who isn't a big reader, likes it. He liked it so much that he bought it! (He never buys any book if it can be found at a library.) Highly recommend.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|Tight band, just what I wanted!<br />Raunchy lyrics, power cord driven, high energy<br />I think these guys do the AC DC sound better than AC DC ever has
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Yep this was great.  No lie.  I will tell you I have read all the books in the series.  Loved the early ones; the last few, not so much.  This book was worth it.  If the author would now turn to the Arrows for more books, that would be AWESOME.  Read the Archangel series.  The first book is AWESOME.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|I just LOVE this (now) trilogy! I am happy to have this in my DVD collection! Excellent film, and great entertainment!
B001EC0OMM|5.0|I love this movie. Cary Grant, James Stewart, and Katherine Hepburn all at their best!  Great comedic material and supporting actors make this a 5 star movie!
B0002YLC24|5.0|I just LOVE this (now) trilogy! I am happy to have this in my DVD collection! Excellent film, and great entertainment!
B00BQI4AU6|4.0|Don't expect just a &#34;Tom Keifer does Cinerella&#34; album.  It has a wide range of styles and the more you listen the more you'll like it.  I find that some of the albums I listen to the most over the years are the ones where maybe only one song jumped right out and said &#34;wow&#34; but where the rest take time to settle in and become more and more favorites.  I think this is one of those and after listening for a while I find I like more and more songs on the album.
159463176X|4.0|Good book but not as intense as his others.  It  jumps around in time and characters a little too much.
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|Classic DP.  Prominent keyboards and that voice.  I just wonder what it would sound like with Ritchie playing on a few songs?  :-)
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|This doesn't live up to The Kite Runner & A Thousand Splendid Suns but I did enjoy it.<br />I felt unresolved at the end which I think was the intention but I didn't like feeling that way.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Grandparents totally enjoyed this game as well as the grandchildren. Get it you will love it. It took grandparents more time to figure it out. Good clean fun.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is an extremely fun game!!! I tried a lot of these types of games and they were either glitchy or too small to read. I am very happy I found this game:)
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is a great app for when you need an alarm clock.  Great for when you're  away from home too .You can program several times  for alarm s when needed<br />.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Sorry, I didn't like this book one bit and gave up reading at nearly half way through.  Maybe it's me!
B0068FZ0GK|4.0|I think this would be more meaningful when I am reaching mid age and look back to see if I have fulfilled my dreams, or need that voice in my head to bring me back on track.<br /><br />Truly remarkable movie. And of course there's Kevin Costner
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Ms. McKenna's first novel is packed with emotion.  Her research regarding orphans allows the reader to understand why Jamie and Lydia both have difficulty with relationships.  A happy ending is expected and delivered.  I enjoyed reading this book.
B00CBU7JQ0|4.0|This is an awesome Box Set for collectors but could have included merchandise like t-shirt or something impressive.<br /><br />The Box Set includes the following items :<br /><br />Digipack with 2 CD<br />DVD (Region 0 / All Regions) with cardboard sleeve<br />2 LP Black Vinyls 180 grams with Gatefold Cover<br />13-Photographic Prints with Hand-written Lyrics<br />Art Print Limited Edition
B002BU0DPE|3.0|It worked well until the earpiece started falling apart. The product seems to be cheaply made and didn't look like they were going to last long when I received them. The sound quality was good, but the manufacturing or materials that this headset is made from are poor.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|As an italian, I love his music. Passione [Deluxe Edition] does touch one's passion for what is human, what is life,<br />what it is to be.  It as his other Musical collections, fantastic.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Dr Zarlenga
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game was very challenging but fun. My daughter finished it before I did and I had to ask her for help!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like it but the game takes too long to load sometimes. The work tasks take to long to do. I mean 12 hours? Really?
B007V2UGPE|1.0|This game looked like it would be a lot of fun, until I realized that the game actually does all the fighting for you.  All you basically do is run either left or right, and you have no control over the sword moves.  Really boring.  I played it for about 10 minutes and deleted it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|highly addictive and fun I love this game it always gives me something to do and I find myself wrapped up for hours trying to get a better score
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book and had great difficulty putting it down. It was shocking, yet moving. Definitely worth reading.
B002XBVQKW|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it and it's even better in HD! Watch it you will enjoy it.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I considered myself fairly in shape before buying this workout video. I needed to continue working out this summer for my health. I also wanted to begin strength training since I mostly do cardio-only. I visited the gym regularly. I heard Jillian was tough, so I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />I only did one day of day one but was surprisingly sore after even though going through the exercises were pretty doable for me. Day two was a lot more challenging and I plan on sticking with it for a while until I can go through it comfortably enough to move on.<br /><br />I bought two of her other DVDs and so far so good, I would recommend it to anybody. I am starting to see definition in my abs and can't wait to keep sweating!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Sometimes i just want to lean back and enjoy some brain candy - this is the movie for that.  Do not expect a message.  Do not expect a love story.  Do not expect a guilt trip.<br /><br />Do expect comic book violence, slapstick with some gore thrown in (quite literally), ugly and uglier witchs, and a lot of fun.  I usually hate gratuitous swearing but for some strange (probably Freudian) reason, I got a laugh out of Gretel being a potty-mouth.<br /><br />So... disengage the analytic side of your brain and enjoy this very fun movie.
B001HM1PFO|4.0|I bought this set for my friend on her birthday and she absolutely loved it. She had seen the movie a couple times but said the picture was excellent in Blu Ray. And I was very happy about the price until it suddenly spiked up quite a bit right as I was checking out.
1608871819|3.0|I bought this book because I'm a Superman fan and loved the Man of Steel movie. This book falls pretty far short of what I hoped it would be and of what it could have been. My primary complaint is that it features very little of the concept art regarding the suit and the 'S symbol' (glyph of the House of El). Visually, the book starts to get boring very quickly, with page after page of desaturated Sci-Fi landscapes and cityscapes. Pretty soon they all start looking the same.<br /><br />When I heard that there were hundreds of concept designs for the S glyph, I got excited, because I find the symbol and its many reinventions over the years to be quite fascinating. I was giddy about this book, hoping it would give us a few pages at least showing the evolution of the S for the movie.<br /><br />Nothing. Total bummer.<br /><br />Similarly for the suit. How interesting would it be to see ideas the production team was throwing around for the suit? The underwear, the cape, etc?<br /><br />Again, almost nothing in this book.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it reminds me of facebooks games, without the annoyance of being on facebook and having to keep bothering your friends for help (so far, anyway)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved how challenging the game was. Didn't take very long to complete but I loved the intrigue of it all. Can't wait till more comes.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I choose a five for rating because it was really helpful I recommend this dictionary book to everyone it has everything you need
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game. Keeps the mind working. Little tricky at first but once you figure out out it gets easier but not to easy to were the game is boring.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I am a number one fan of spiderman and so far, this app is fantastic!! I play it all the time, and it is one of my favorites. The buildings are so realistic, and its support fun to spinning from buildings.this ago is definitely worth the money!!
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|I can't stop listening to this! I beats Kanye's cd out of the water,  even tho that's pretty good too. A must have!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a awesome game because I love horse's. I love riding in competitions they gave me was cool. I love this game and I will always play this game

B005LAJ212|5.0|The  story is gripping,the scenery wonderful. Some very good actors, including the beautiful dog.<br />I live in Brazil and I'm looking forward to Amazon release of  the second season!
B0086700CM|5.0|An amazingly addicting game you will never be able to put down! I could literally play for hours and never get bored of it. Works awesome on the kindle fire
0765348276|5.0|Pretty good military science fiction novel. Comparable to Starship Troopers and the Forever War. I give it a high rating.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|The controls and everything including the graphics on the game is completely legit. They're really cool. You can either do 'touch' or 'gyro' controls. I actually tried both and loved both. The only reason that this game is not given a 5 star review is because of the fact that you only earn one gem/diamond every time you level up, but it needs 20 to revive yourself if you die the first time in a game and if you die the second time it's 40. Come on now, if it cost that much to revive at least give us 5 or 10 gems/diamonds  every time we level up.
B009MO57H6|4.0|About normal for a Resident Evil Video. As usual Milla Jovovich did an excellent performance. Recommended for zombie flick fans.
0894803123|4.0|Great initial recipes - only not a 5 b/c of limited testing so far!!  But we'll be sure to change that soon so I can update my review.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|Just goes to show you what a little imagination can do when you have three kids who are good friends from very different backrounds, when they put their mind's to it.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|It is very addicting.You shouldn't watch if you aren't ready to be hooked. You'll soon see why its one of the most popular shows on TV
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so good and children can play it to! I say you go to Amazon website and get this app now on all devices that you have! :)
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I never buy CDs anymore. EVER. I bought this to get my order up to the free shipping amount and Love the CD. Good old T. Swift, hope she stays that way.  I like all the songs on the CD too, not just the radio popular ones.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|pretty fun it is similar to 100 floors but this one is more challenging.so far I like it but not sure if it stays free....
B00499NHLC|5.0|Unless you have 5 hours to devote because you will find yourself totally intrigued and immersed in this modern day Sherlock and will be driven to watch all three episodes.  And then Season 2!  I am currently enjoying them both again for the third time with my wife who had not been a Sherlock Holmes fan but got interested by the CBS version &#34;Elementary&#34;
0061122416|5.0|Felt so inspired by this book  - Yes, it is a simple story - but isn't that how life is... we just make it complicated.  I'm reading this book for the second time - The book is so hopeful that you put yourself in the characters shoes and you think to yourself - what am I doing... I love this book - it's one of my favorite... If you gave this a negative review you need to re read this book - it's awesome...
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Loved the book. Love the kid.  Would have been nice to be somewhat like him but wasn't at all.  But fun to read.<br />Recommend this read.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I've never read books as fast a I do Connelly's.  The cold case gets drawn out a little in this one with slight transgression, but overall I'm glad it completed my list of Harry Bosch novels read. :)

B00B29J0I6|5.0|\\"Rescue Roby\\" is a cute, animated puzzle game that is based on the laws of motion and the law of gravity.  But the game is much more fun than Physics class because you don't need to solve any equations to solve the puzzles.  ;)<br /><br />To save Roby from the factory reject pile, you need to maneuver him into a box so he can be packed and carried away by the factory's machinery.  As you remove the pieces of the puzzle board, the remaining objects in the puzzle will move according to the laws of physics.  If you don't solve the puzzle the first time, you just learn from your mistake(s) and just try again!<br /><br />The product description for the app states:  \\"While the free version offers full access to only the first chapter, the full version of Rescue Roby unlocks all 4 unique chapters.\\"  So I wasn't sure what would be included in the free app of the day package.  I was happy to discover that all five chapters and 70+ levels are included with the free app of the day.  They are locked when you first start playing, but they are there.<br /><br />The chapters in the adventure story are:<br /><br />Meet Roby (with 20 adventures that are unlocked as you go)<br />Twice the Fun (Locked)<br />Miss Understood (Locked)<br />Hi Tech (Locked)<br />Love Story (Locked)<br /><br />The player tries to collect all three of the gears in each adventure.  As you solve each puzzle correctly, the next level is unlocked.  If you want to practice, you can go back and replay the adventures you've already solved.  By re-playing the level, you have an opportunity to collect the gears that you missed.  Once you've collected all three gears, you can replay the level, but you cannot add to your total gears by collecting the same gears again.  The adventure scoreboard shows you which adventures you've solved, and how many gears out of the three you've collected in each adventure, so you know where to focus your efforts.<br /><br />The number of gears you need to collect to unlock the next chapter is tracked from the main menu page.  You're told you need x/y to advance to the next chapter  (where x equals the number of gears you've earned and y equals the number you need to earn to complete the challenge).  For example, you may have earned 18/60, which means you've earned 18 gears out of the 60 gears available within the current chapter.  The menu page also displays the number of gears you need to earn unlock the next chapter of the book.<br /><br />The animated puzzles are cute, and it is fun to figure out how to make the physics work out to solve the puzzle.  The music is light; it stays in the background and doesn't interfere with my concentration while I'm solving the puzzles.  The puzzles have gotten more difficult as I've moved up, and some of them require quite a bit of reasoning.  But I'm looking forward to solving all of the puzzles and saving Roby, and recommend the game to kids and adults.pter is tracked from the main menu page.

0812982622|5.0|Adam Johnson received a well-deserved Pulitzer for this work, and I consider it a must-read, though not an easy read. The book gives the reader a sense of what life is like in North Korea, long closed to the West. The story is a journey of an orphan's journey to self-awareness, a love story, and a seeking of redemption.<br /><br />I do not want to give the plot away. I only know that in repeated moments I was horrified and saddened by the reality of life under a dictatorship; yet I came to understand how people could appreciate the security of such a life filled with omnipresent loudspeakers blaring daily the official version of reality.<br /><br />Adam Johnson has received praise for his realistic portrayal of North Korea. His writing transforms what could be a polemic into fine, fine story-telling. Its many layers of intimacy and courage will long stay in your heart.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|This book was chosen by my book group. Not the best memoir I have read, but readable. Not a book for religious conservatives, however.
B00BVYU2P2|5.0|Has a different perspective on life.  Still quite watchable even for those not in high school any longer.  Coming of age story.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|Kanye's 'Yeezus,' is quite a mashup...part hip hop, part punk rock...all Kanye.  Some hits, some misses.  My favorite is, &#34;Black Skinhead.&#34;  Aggressive and in your face.  That's the Kanye we all know and love.  I like it!
B000002N2P|4.0|Released in 1995, \\"Insomniac\\" was Green Day's second major label record, and their fourth album overall. This album follows in the footsteps of its predecessor \\"Dookie,\\" but for some reason it just didn't have that kick like the aforementioned \\"Dookie\\" had.<br /><br />Released at a time when alt-rock was all the rage in the U.S., Green Day took the reigns and ran with them. Many people bashed this album for not being as good as their previous outings, but for my money, it's just as enjoyable as all their other records. The biggest difference is the absence of that one real killer track on the album that Green Day is so noted for. Granted I love \\"Brain Stew,\\" \\"Jaded,\\" \\"Geek Stink Breath\\" and \\"Walking Contradiction,\\" but none of these rivals \\"Basket Case\\" and \\"Welcome to Paradise.\\" To be honest though, it's tough to follow up a record like \\"Dookie.\\" Many bands released amazing records and never followed them up with anything; at least Green Day has continued to pump out terrific albums to this day.<br /><br />Another no brainer on the Green Day front. No way hard rock fans will be disappointed, and for the rare chance that you're never heard a Green Day song, this album has some of their best work in my opinion. Great album all the way around.
B0063M22QO|5.0|You will love this game! It gets more challenging as you go so you won't ever get bored. SO ENJOYABLE!  : )
B0018D4SHY|5.0|Little Richard is quite simply one of the best rock n' roll singers of all time. He never gets the praise of say an Elvis, Buddy Holly or Chuck Berry, but he's definitely in the same category as those guys for sure. I saw this guy in concert in 2003, and man he didn't miss a beat even for his age.<br /><br />Entertaining is the first word that comes to mind when describing Little Richard. This guy was the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of performing in the mid-late 1950s. He undoubtedly never received as much fame as other artists because of being African-American, but that never stopped this cat from churning out some of the best rock songs in history. Just remember songs like \\"Long Tall Sally\\" (Predator, anyone?), \\"Keep A Knockin'\\" from \\"Christine,\\" and many others that are pure rock n' roll gold. There is no way people won't know and love most of these songs, and it's about time this guy receives the accolades he deserves.<br /><br />Good buy for the price of this record. You have to be careful with Little Richard recordings; in the 60s he re-recorded many of his hits because of money issues, but those songs pale in comparisons with these.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Great twist on the old classic. Good storyline, excellent special effects. Liked the good vs. evil allegory and underlying lesson. Definitely recommend.
B000002MP2|5.0|Punk band Green Day released their third album, and first major label offering in 1994. The time was right for a resurgence of the classic punk rock sound of the late 70s, and Green Day capitalized on it and ran. This album has eventually went on to sell over ten-million copies, and easily remains one of the best of the entire decade.<br /><br />Green Day are essentially a melodic rock band in punk rock outfits. Listen to the majority of their records and you see a very polished, and accomplished hard rock band. These guys have a knack for just writing really catchy rock songs, and to this day you still hear their songs on rock radio. While admittedly never being a monster Green Day fan, this record has always held a special place in my heart. The entire album is chalked full of terrific songs, and the radio songs are just the tip of the iceberg. This album is still the pinnacle of Green Day's career, and it's tough to imagine them ever topping this offering today. This is simply just a great, fun record to listen to when your in a good mood.<br /><br />Simply stated, this album is an absolute no brainer for fans of hard rock music. There's no way rock music fans wouldn't really dig this album, and you'd be treating yourself to one of the finest slices of 90's hard rock music.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|This album rocks i cant stop listening to it i was especially surprise at how good donnie and jon can sing wooo love it
B001V5CIFI|5.0|This movie is total quality. The characters are full of life and Emma Thompson is excellent as Nanny McPhee. It teaches wonderful lessons in life for children.

B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I read quite a bit and sometimes go back and read the same book again.  I had not read this one in quite some time.  I enjoyed it almost as much as the first time.  The depth, the characters and the story line blend very well together and I highly recommend the book or the movie.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother (it's her all-time favorite movie) and she LOVED IT! At first she was a bit concerned that it might be in color due to the front cover of the DVD, but was reassured that the movie was indeed in good-ol' black and white. Great buy for an even better price!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|The content was a bit hard to take, since it's about dead babies, but I like the writer's style and found it entertaining enough to hold my interest and overlook that part. I like forensics and sciece, but someone who doesn't probably won't enjoy this book as much as I did.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I could not put this book down. Emma Chase is a very talented author who has you laughing the minute you open the book. Drew, the protagonist, is a handsome ladies man, and generally gets what he wants until he meets his match. Throughout the book, he speaks to the readers directly, so you become part of the story. My cheeks were hurting from laughing so much. If you enjoyed Wallbanger, you will love this.<br /><br />Ellie T.
B0055EDBIE|5.0|I was excpecting a typically great rock & roll album, but wow what a change!  Black & White America shows an R&B side of Lenny.  A lil rap with Boongie Drop featuring Jay-Z; that surprised me, but pleasantly.  Love this CD; especially Sunflower feat Drake.  Good job Mr. Kravitz!!!

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|First, I assume that most people know about the movie itself at this point, so I'll start out by talking about the media. We got the 3D blu ray and just played it for the first time. We've only had a 3D set for about a year now, so our 3D collection is still somewhat limited. However, it does include The Avengers, Avatar, and John Carter of Mars ... all excellent 3D presentations. I honestly think that this topped all of the others. The opening credits were particularly noteworthy. Everything about the blu ray was top notch, as is normally the case with blu rays of recent films. Both picture and audio were outstanding.<br /><br />Now, how about the Star Trek? To state my qualifications, I watched the very first Star Trek &#34;sneak preview&#34; episode in 1966. I was immediately hooked, and I doubt there is an episode I haven't seen 10 times or more over the years ... favorites like The Trouble with Tribbles more than that. So I've been a fan of every series and every movie now for closing in on 50 years.<br /><br />As an original Star Trek fan, this movie hit the spot. There were numerous little tributes to the Original Series throughout this film. It was a treasure trove of nostalgia for folks like me who know that series from every angle. I'll be honest, when I first heard the rumor that Khan was coming back (AGAIN) I rolled my eyes. But they pulled it off, and fantastically. Were some of the plot resolutions telegraphed far in advance? Yes they were. However, I'd like to think that if they make a Star Trek film true to the spirit of TOS (TV and movies), and a fan is intimately familiar with TOS, it is very understandable that they could see some of these things coming.<br /><br />And it literally doesn't matter if you do. There are plenty of surprises regardless.<br /><br />Dialogue throughout the film is snappy and often laugh-out-loud funny in a good way. And once again the triangle of Kirk-Spock-McCoy provided most of the humor and sharp-witted lines. Some of them go by so quickly that you have to pay close attention to catch everything. It was delightful.<br /><br />Even the closing credits are a treat, with a couple of touches certain to put a lump in the throats of long-time fans like me. Watch particularly for the way that Nimoy is credited, and the outstanding orchestral presentation of the original theme music. Fantastic.<br /><br />You might guess that I find this film and this blu ray product to be:<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Enjoy.them go by so quickly that you have to pay close attention to catch everything.

B0045HCIZY|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. If you love romance and dialogue, you'll love this movie. Hawke and Depley are wonderful together
034580404X|5.0|This was brand new and exciting to open up for the first time, a great deal too. Enticing to read, and emotionally attaching. I was sad when I finished the trilogy because it meant the story was over.
0810970686|5.0|This book was purchased for one of my granddaughters. She was excited to receive the book and read the entire book in a day. She told me she liked the book very much.

B00004S8Q9|5.0|Great follow up to Voodoo Highway!  Solid band with Chaisson, Martin and the late Gillen.  And, as always killer riffs and blues guitar from Jake!
B00C2VIA52|4.0|While this a very fun and addictive game, the difficulty ramps up quick and you will feel a need to buy cards with real money to push forward in the campaign.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|The game can get hard at some times but I love playing creation mode I have four stars cause some stuff dose not pop up
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Overall a nice game. It could be a bit more challenging. Hopefully new levels will come soon and it will get more challenging. Would be nice if you could explore more of the room and the instructions could be more complete, like telling you. How to pick up items.
B005LAII0I|4.0|Not too bad, but it's some what better than Walt Disney. but not be much. My younger sister loved it, that's why i got it.

B001NLKZUA|3.0|I keep waiting for something to develop with Clary and Jace, but instead of developing this, the story dragged along with one mis-stepped problem after another. It would've been much better if the author had really killed off Simon instead of making him into a vampire that could walk during the day because he drank a Nephilim's blood. The battle on the ship had a lot of build up, but seemed to lack energy in how it was described. I was never truly afraid for the characters. All in all, a very so-so read.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I thought CLOUD ATLAS would be super good, but to me - it was somewhat dull and I had to use my own imagination to allow myself to finish the Movie. I only finished it because of the Cast of Stars. I would not watch it again, even though it has great scenery and Star Power.
0394873742|5.0|I teach Pre-K and my students love this book.  They love the illustrations and are motivated to read the labels for each little picture!  The purchase and delivery were quick and easy.

B0084B1T8Y|4.0|My son loved this book, enjoyed rikki tikki tavi the most. I liked the seal story my self, maybe that's where the idea of happy feet came from! My son also loved the white seal.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|This is a very fun game but there should be more realistic this like Bird strike and  engine failures on free flight and you should be able to crash land in farm fields without blowing up. You should also be able to fly bomber planes like b25 and b17 and many other planes. And your plane should be able to get bullet holes and lose wings and other pieces. There should also be online battles with other people. So I hope that in the next update that there will be the things that I talked about are in the game.the game should be more like the war thunder game that I am unable to get.
B00CWVFZ8W|4.0|I wanted to see this movie when it first came out in the movie theaters but missed it.  I am glad that I was finally able to see in on Amazon.  Nice special effects.  I would go see the sequel if they made one.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|It's okay.  My child wanted me to down load but he really didn't like it.  A little more experience in driving is required, for an 8 year old.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game. Challenging but not impossible to solve the puzzles. Much better than some of the similar games. Hope there will be more levels soon. Thanks.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Another fun &quot;elevator&quot; game.  I really enjoy these and hope new floors will appear SOON!  This is my third in this genre and it's one you should try!

B00AM0C6YG|4.0|It's always tempting to say that someone sounds like this singer or that singer. Laura Mvula is unique. Her arrangements and harmonies, artistic and almost avant-garde, but beautiful and accessible, I am grateful to NPR for featuring her on weekend edition. This is an excellent addition to my collection.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game, played all 10 levels in one shot because I couldn't put my kindle down...can't wait for more levels to be added
B002N5N4M6|4.0|I used to say that my two favorite US TV comedies are Frasier and Friends. Now I have to say, my &#34;three&#34; favorite. They are all different; they are all hysterical. And having always been a huge quantum physics fan, i appreciate the smart humor, along with the wonderfully juvenile at times humor.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I think this show is a bit of a soap opera with characters dying and suddenly they're not dead and other characters being scandalously related through love affairs, but I love it all the same. I suppose all the drama is necessary to keep viewers interested through all the twist and turns in the plot. I know it's definitely kept me interested. I can't hardly wait to see what they do with season 3.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|This game is the best ww2 game I have found on the appstore yet. There is an invisible wall at the dirt landing strip but other than a few bugs I love this game I mean simulator.
B00C061HZY|5.0|I was aware of daft Punk, saw them at Lollapalooza, but didn't have any of their albums or really listened to them regularly. This album had so much hype that I got sucked in to the buzz leading up to the release. I had read an article about how the album was recorded and mastered, they used all live instruments performed by some heavy hitters in the studio session players for classic soul/disco.  And they had some amazing studio mixer and mastered by Bob Ludwig (one of the few legends in mastering).<br /><br />I'll break this down a bit:<br /><br />Music:<br />Very different than any other Daft Punk album. This is a good thing for me, I was not a huge fan before. But the variety of songs, and the style are all surprisingly well thought out.  My favorite is side 2 disk 2, starting with Motherboard and finishing with Contact- this sounds more like a Medeski Martin and Wood album at times, Radiohead at times, and some retro disco like Suzi Lane.<br /><br />Vinyl:<br />Great presentation, lovely booklet insert with tons of info, and great heavy vinyl pressing. The sound out of the records is nothing short of superb. I can't stress this enough, this album sounds amazing. The bass is so nice and tight, the dynamics are pleasant and not pinned at the loudest level.<br /><br />Overall:<br />5 stars, I love it and look forward to another album.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good read with some surprises. Sheds some more light on the plight of mentally ill children in our society and the helplessness of the parents and family of such individuals whose 'wiring' is different.
030758836X|5.0|This book delivers all the suspense and surprises hoped for in a thriller. Told alternately from the perspectives of the two main characters, a married couple named Nick and Amy. Little in this book is as it first appears, but the author does a great job of making each twist seem believable and realistic. This story is an in-your-face reminder that no matter how well you know someone, you never know them completely. It's easy to see why this story has become so immensely popular. I imagine there are a whole lot more people out there these days, sneaking a glance at their partner across the room and wondering what secrets they may not know.<br />Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\"
1452101248|5.0|I LOVE meat. Growing up, when my mom asked what I wanted for dinner, I'd just respond with a type of meat. With that being said, the recipes in this book are AMAZING. They're not silly ways of replacing meat with something else (like tofu), they're just DELICIOUS meals that don't happen to have (nor need) meat, and you won't even notice. I bought one for myself, and one for my sister and will likely buy one for anyone I know looking to add some more veggies to their diet.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I purchased this item for my son who is 18+ and he loves this for his ps3 and has not had any problems or issues with it. The price was reasonable as well for this particular item.  Plus, I usually wait until the price is right on this kind of stuff before I purchase it!!
B00005RDRO|5.0|This movie is one of my two &#34;go to&#34; movies when I need a good laugh.  If you like all the older classic detective movies, this is a must have movie spoof
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I read quite a bit of this book but since I was interested in other books that concentrated more on my spiritual and soul journey, I did not give it the time it required.  It is a very serious book that requires concentration on the various characters to understand what is going on. However, it is an interesting book and I may get back to it at some point.
B00498YZFK|4.0|An early look at Jennifer Laurence shows her skill in acting as well as her on screen presence.  The supporting actors looked like they were from the Ozarks and gave strong supporting efforts.  Great buildup to the ending and a very thought provoking final scene.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I did not watch this show while it was on till the very end. But once my doctor told me what it was really about, I started watching it from the beginning and played catch up over two weekends and finally saw the last couple of episodes on tv.  I will definitely watch the next season as I am now a believer. I have become invested in the characters. I have to admit is is a Great TV show!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this Bible everywhere.  I love that I can access so many different versions of The Bible.  I use it in church and I can pull up different versions of verses.  It gives me a different perspective when I can read Bible verses in various versions.
B0011TQLA2|5.0|This album fills my brain with swirling, colourful images. I swim down, deep in the ocean, I kiss fluffy clouds, I feel the kind of love that aches deep in my bones...I love this album. It brings out so many emotions. How does Radiohead continue to make such incredible music? They just blow my mind...I live inside a dream of their making and never want to wake up.<br /><br />House of Cards, Weird Fishes, and All I Need are my favourite tracks. This album is a must own.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love being able to get my emails when I'm away from my computer.  I can receive and answer emails whenever I need to.  Love it.
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|If you like fantasy, action and drama this is the movie for you. I wouldn't recommend it for young kids but super for adults.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Easy to use app. Intuitive. Does the job with a simple clean interface. Many options, but not cluttered.  Highly recommended.
B0031R5K68|5.0|Great read, Dan Brown has a fantastic way of making you really think about things and keeps you wondering. There are so many places I'm keen to see to really see it the way Robert Langdon  saw it. I could hardly wait to start reading his fourth book in the series, Inferno.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It does what it should: lets you explore, survive and build houses, but it doesn't have a lot of materials, the only enemies are zombies, you can't spawn or play with multiple people and it's harder to use. I would recommend 'Survival Craft' if you're looking for a good Minecraft Pocket Edition. I like Minecraft X-Box and PC much better.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|After reading many not so good reviews of this book I was kind of worried I would be disappointed.  I was pleasantly surprised with how I enjoyed the book, but I did not like how it ended
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wonderful graphics and movements. Never glitches. It has things like zip-lines, mines, waterfalls and much more. There are twists and turns and good obstacles. A great improvement on Temple Run!
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Love the Book..kept me reading till there was no more pages..very well written...Where's the next one and the one after that and so on?
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I normally don't like games like this where you have to purchase fake money with real money. But this one you CAN level-up without using real money. It also has a better concept then 'buy and place' and 'wait an hour for fake money'. In this one you can actually go out to places like a jungle and try to rescue hurt wild animals to put in your zoo. It's a really fun game.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game 1 of my favorite bingo games!love the 5 free tournament!enjoy the voices in the different types of dialects the hostess is beautiful!
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This app is really amazing! It helps me check my work fast and easily. I would definitely recommend this app to ANYONE who wants a good calculator app.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I'll be looking for a new weather solution. The new layout is atrocious, and the list of permissions required is appalling.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is fun. Me and my cousins played it for hours on New Year's Eve. It's hilarious! One of my cousins always asks to play when she sees me.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|If you want a great summer read or need to burn some time in the airport - this is the book.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I like this game because it's fun and u have a whole world to explore and u get coins to buy bigger sharks or food and u also find gems too and if u find a shell it will make u go to the next level and this whole game is free it works great on kindle fire too.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This app is really really fun!! The piano can sound like different instruments when you play it. Plus lus lots of songs you can learn!  OMG SO FUN
B0091VTISO|4.0|Not the worst remake it had some good action sequences and a decent story line it was all in all a good movie
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and wanted to see it again and show it to my husband. It was as lovely a jewel as I remembered. There is a vein of darkness in this tale of growing up. Acting is excellent, design is spare and clean. Like a Cohen Brothers movie for a younger set and adults. Not for children who might be embarrassed at seeing a teenage girl in her underwear.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I just love the fact that there are gravity fields in the game...finaly a game with challenge and untreated in one.  :)
B000FCK65W|5.0|I first read this book when I was probably 13! I have read it several times since and I never tire of this book! It tells the story of severe poverty, but also how wonderful it is to have the support of family! I had read this book on my mother's recommendation because she wanted to make sure that I was reading books with some substance! I am often surprised at how much different this book is when I am reading this book as an adult, as opposed to when I didn't have the life experiences that I do now! I can appreciate the book much better now! It is a favorite of mine and always will be!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love the challenges and the puzzles. i wish there were more levele but I cant wait till there are more levels
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game is beast you get to fight thugs infamous villians and it is like batman arkham city which is beast
0385528752|5.0|Whether it's to your lifestyle or in the workplace, this will really help you make progress with any kind of change.  Don't get angry with the people that are resistant (or with yourself) - get this book and then actually use the techniques it describes.
B00847KFDS|4.0|While it's interesting hearing other peoples's takes on some classic CCR tunes....you can't improve on perfection and the originals are better. That being said, there are some good songs here and I hope it will broaden out his audience to folks who listen to the people who are involved with the duets here.
159562015X|5.0|I've done this with my work group and they loved it.  We laughed so hard at each other's reactions to our own analyses and how well they hit the target that we got complaints from people outside the closed meeting room door!  It was a great teambuilding exercise (and not just fluff) and people really appreciated the opportunity to get to know themselves, and each other, better.  It's giving me some really good tools to better manage my people, improve their productivity while giving them more chances to do things that are a good fit for their talents.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|this is a fun game if you want to do something mindless....can be adactive.  would recommend playing this one...great<br /><br />.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever!! You have to get it! Better than temple run and easier. Great for kids and adults! GET IT!!!!
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|you should really just buy toca boca hair saloon instead . The controlls stink on this game.  toca boca is sooo much better
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This is just a trick to get you to pay to play Bingo.  That is stupid.  If you have something to do, it should be free!
B00BL5EQLC|1.0|I did not like this app at all!! I thought it was stupid.  I am so glad I got it when was free otherwise I would be upset for buying it!
B0094MFITS|5.0|The whole &#34;Jesse Stone&#34; series is a delight.  Good stories with common sense solutions to low life criminals.  Be certain to watch them in order.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This app is okay.  It is just like all of the other puzzle apps out there.  It wasn't very challenging for me and to get some of the other puzzles you have to pay for them.
B002APU580|5.0|Directed by Joe Wright, Pride and Prejudice (2005), is a remake of the original film from 1940 that tells a love story of a most unlikely couple that constantly battle against being together. In the end, they realize they are perfect for each other (sorry for ruining it). And of course, one cannot forget the classic scene of Mr. Darcy confessing his love to Elizabeth in the pouring rain, which is my favorite part. This film is for all the romantics, and the fans of the distinguished Jane Austen.<br />It boasts a completely innovative soundtrack that fits the film perfectly. Dario Marianelli composed a beautiful assortment of piano pieces as well as full orchestration sequences that complete the film and allows the audience to feel immersed in the Victorian time period. Another aspect that is effectively conveyed by the music is how it asserts how the audience should be feeling throughout the film.<br />The cast is especially impressive, including Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennett, and Matthew Macfayden as the timeless Mr. Darcy. The sweet and witty demeanor of the characters creates an atmosphere that is sure to impress any audience. Vitality and life are strong influences that create a sense of happiness in practically every scene.<br />Classiness is overwhelming in this film, and the story is basically the same as the book, which I find refreshing, despite the trend of changing the movie entirely from the way things are originally in the book. This film is a perfectly crafted ingenious production, and is definitely my favorite movie.
B007ZD17XO|3.0|This is an ok app.  I played it for a while but got boarded wit it after playing for several days.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This series is fantastic! You get so involved with the characters, and the presentation of the story you want it to go on until next month. Great all the way around. I'm ready for any and all of the upcoming seasons. C6
B006BDHAX0|3.0|This is a pretty good app.  I found I quick playing after a bit.  I like most Mahjong games but this just didn't fit me.  I did find one the is keeping me interested it's called &#34;all-in-one-one manning.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Besides the remarkable performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, this movie was remarkably easy to follow, very little Hollywood pretentiousness, or trivial PC like so many of today's studies of great men, bad or good.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This app is a good one.  The further into the game you the harder it gets.  It's good way to kill time when I'm waiting for something such as at the airport.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|I'm not a critique, I just like some things and not others. The story was well structured and retained the elements of the &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34; movie, while creating a believable Oz character, con man, conniver, carnival hustler. The chain of events was fun to view. The story before the tornado was, of course, printed in gray scale (i.e. previously called, black and white) like the original movie, switching to full color at the appropriate time. The flying monkeys, the marching witch's guards, all continued with costumes and grunts like in the 1937 movie. A nice blend of elements from the original movie with this back story.<br /><br />Overall, the witches were grand character studies, fulfilling expectations. The alter ego of Oz was technically feasible, rather than magic. I enjoyed watching the movie. It didn't drag, and was filled with unexpected directions, with a satisfactory ending -- evil destroyed and the innocent prevailed.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|From the first time this app was opened I did not like it at all.  Even my teenage grandchildren didn't like it.  They said it was too juvenile for them.
B0074MZSPO|5.0|Music is great.  Record design is pretty basic.  Would definitely buy again knowing what I know after owning it.  Words
B007TKT2SK|4.0|This is super easy to use! Especially if fractions aren't for those using it.  I would recommend it to others.
B0049D1TCM|5.0|hey it's nicki minaj, i like her music and the beats are out of this world, just waiting on her next one to come out
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I had wondered how this app would be. I have tried others and ended up disappointed in most of the sudoku apps but this one keeps me guessing with each new puzzle.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|hey my daughter and i like her music and the beats are out of this world, just waiting on her next one to come out
B00AQM8H9I|2.0|I felt this app was a total waste of my time.  Even my grandchildren did not like it.  I'm so glad it was free.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|hey it's nicki minaj, i like her music and the beats are out of this world, just waiting on her next one to come out
B00795P4EG|4.0|I haven't used this app as much I want.  I do found out it will only work with certain type pictures though. I will keep this one and work with those pictures that aren't too busy.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Very compact blue tooth system. easy to use and has great rang and also very less noise. Charging port location is little uncomfortable to use.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I like the way this app works.  I like the way it looks. So far it has run very smoothly for me.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game. it is awesome.  I love the dragons that I can breed. they are sooooo cool.I love it.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I really love this app!  It has different puzzle arrangements to make it interesting.  There are some arrangements that I have never seen before in other Mahjong apps.  I recommend this if you love the Mahjong games.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was detailed enough so that I could &#34;see&#34; the story and really understand the characters, but not so much it drug on. In fact, it was hard to put down.
0064431789|5.0|Every time we read this (which is daily right now), our toddler finds some new detail in the pictures.  He adores the story.  I think this was the first time he got the idea of consequences for actions.  Little boy is naughty and gets sent to bed without dinner - our son's eyes got big on the third night, &#34;Mommy will I get sent to bed without dinner?&#34;  As a mom, finding a new possible tool to use is always a win.  Outside of that, this is just a really fun story to read.  Easy to dramatize for the child, love how he squeals with laughter.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|It probably helps to be consistently ranked one of the most influential people in Hollywood, if not the most influential person, because then you can choose a project that has intelligence to it and do it correctly, not with shameless pandering to attract audiences, yet at the same time satisfy some of the blood- and action-lust that is thought to draw men to the movies, along with their dates. This movie delivers on a lot of points that are characteristic of the star's iconic roles, and, what is something that identifies a fine piece of detective fiction for me, it holds together. Even I didn't notice some stuff, or, I should say, didn't question some stuff ... echoing something the hero says in a moment of possibly breathtaking but endearing humility. I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone, though, so enough said there.<br /><br />There was violence, but not gratuitous; there was sex? Meh. There was action; yes ... controlled, adult, as in, mature, action, which I find so much more exciting and erotic than, again, the pandering to some lowest common denominator that if the denizens of such baseness were to find themselves waking up in and looking at each other in, is so low they might wonder why they were there; possibly nobody is that brain-dead that they go for cartoonish gore. In a word, there aren't too many action movies that hold my attention. This isn't to say that I am an arbiter of what is good or bad; but what I think Hollywood sometimes doesn't realize is that there may be absolute standards of what makes something great, or trending on the scale that way, because everyone appreciates what is classic. Think of the best films out there ... Godfather, The Fugitive, Seven. Did you like them? Because scores of other people can watch them over and over again. The intelligence behind them makes them endure.<br /><br />So whatever your common denominator, I think you'll find this one worth the two hours in front of your tv.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Nothing is ever what you want in the end.<br />II felt the ending was weak, I thought she just wanted to series to end.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Like entire series, can't put it down! Now I have to wait for next one to get closure on the Gideon / Eva story
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I don't read much science fiction and this book reminds me why. There is a decent premise but the characters are thin and the story telling is flat. You (I) can't determine the different characters from their voices. They all sound the same. And the narrative format seems more like a rough draft or a story board. The literature aspect doesn't hold a candle to Stegner, Russo, or McMurtry.<br />And so many questions are unanswered: foremost,  how did the zombies come about in the first place?  It's one thing to understand the new ones have to be destroyed but aren't  there also zombies still being created by the original virus or whatever it was. If so, you couldn't just cleanup the mess once; you'd have to stop the original cause.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Computer spying by China is what is in the news now.  Good insight into what is going on with new technology and the spy business.
1119963192|5.0|A fantastic book; beautifully written and illustrated; great explanations; great drills. A wonderful resource for swimmers at any level who are committed to get better.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This is a good game to play with someone or by yourself the graphics are great and the game is a lot of fun. You can also be in the tournament with someone or the computer it is very addicting
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I read it, so it wasn't like I couldn't get through it.  But I found it to be a bit predictable and a little bit of a let down.  The slave characters weren't developed enough for me...they seemed like they were written by someone who had just read about other slave characters and decided to use those characters with new names.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|The Dark Knight was probably one of the most fantastic movies ever, and (in my opinion) the best movie in the batman trilogy. I would highly recommend this to any batman fans.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fun game...great stress reliever! My daughter put it on my new tablet for me and now whenever I am just too stressed I chop a little fruit!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Loved it! Oh man the balls on this guy! Makes me proud to be a Texan.<br /><br />Thank you for your service!<br /><br />RIP Chris
B003UYUP58|5.0|Well written with lots of interesting facts about cancer and cancer treatment through history. Highly recommend for both hard-core scientists as well as non-scientists.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This game is okay but if you are looking for a hair salon game try toco hair salon if you want a hair salon game it is not as good as it seems
B008220BLG|5.0|I love this movie a lot. I think its very unique, even with its allusion to R&J.<br /><br />I don't really like writing reviews but in order to do the stars I have to say something... so...yea....
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I love reading a book that I get caught up in enough to start reading slower toward the end to keep from finishing it. This book did that for me. I wanted to turn pages faster to find out what was going to happen next while not wanting the story to end. The book is well written, has a lot of detail while not being bogged down with it and, even with the bad things going on in the life of Nate, you are still left with hope for something better coming. I definitely look forward to the next book and hope the wait will not be too long.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|its the Bible,  what's not to love right!  I like all the different versions. it is easy to navigate.  also like being able to have different font sizes, book marking in different Colorado.  just all around a great app!!!!
B008DK3PJC|5.0|Beethoven's string quartets contain some of his finest music, in my view. The early Opus 18 quartets retain elements of the classicism of Haydn and Mozart while moving the form into new territory, the wonderful Rasoumovsky Quartets in his middle period have some sublime slow movements and show the real development in Beethoven's music, and the amazing late quartets contain a mixture of the strange, the inspiring and the beautiful as Beethoven's genius reached its final flowering. To have all this in one box is truly wonderful.<br /><br />The performances by the Alban Berg Quartet are excellent. They date from the early 1980s, were very highly regarded at the time and have aged very well, I think. They are technically excellent, their intonation is flawless and show great insight in interpretation. Very fine cycles have been recorded since by other quartets, but I still listen to these discs with great pleasure and for a great complete cycle at budget price I'd say you couldn't do better than this. The slow movement of the A minor quartet Op.132 is one of music's true miracles, and the Alban Bergs' playing of it is still my favourite of any quartet - indeed, it's possibly my favourite 15 minutes of music anywhere. The recording of the Quartet in E flat major, Op.74 (\\"The Harp\\") included in this set was selected by BBC Radio 3 CD Review's Building a Library in 2011 as the best available. Given the phenomenal standard of the competition, it's a fine endorsement of the quality of this box.<br /><br />If you're looking for a recording of the Beethoven Quartets to get to know, this is ideal, and if you're already familiar with them there is plenty to enjoy in these interpretations. At this price it's an exceptional bargain, too, and I recommend this set very warmly indeed.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is awesome-I use it to tune out my twins screaming when I'm trying to get them to put themselves to sleep, as listening to your kids cry is one of the hardest things.  I love that you can mix different sounds together.  Definitely recommend!
B003U4UOP4|5.0|Enjoy the greatness of this season. The last two are all downhill from here. Of course, you will still watch them.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I really appreciate the work went into this game by developer. Thanks for putting this game out for everyone to play!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I had read some reviews that were not so impressed with this novel, so I had a tiny bit of trepidation. However, now that I've finished it, I have to say it was personally my favorite so far--perhaps it is due to the setting in America, so &#34;closer to home&#34; with more familiar  places, history, vocabulary, traditions, foods, etc. Ms. Gabaldon is a treasure and an unbelievably brilliant novelist; i'm on to the 5th book now
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Best book I've read in a while.  A little bit of mystery to puzzle together but oh so worth it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Yeah people this is the best game u have ever made.I love it just like my kids. U are the best people in the world.<br />Love'<br />  123
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Great acting, great storyline... can't wait for the next session... almost 3/4 of a year way.<br /><br />I have an identical twin, this show has reminding me of my/our first decade, as not an individual brown haired girl but one of a set. We were always someone's game of which one are you?
B000M5AJQS|4.0|So Martin Scorsese remakes Korean pictures now? Sure enough. And does a pretty good job of it too. Here's a few things that you might like:<br /><br />Leo DiCaprio: He's a man now. No more little teenage baby face kid. He's tough and not just playing tough.<br /><br />Matt Damon: Plays the double agent to a 'T'. Equal parts bravado and sniveling.<br /><br />Solid performances by Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, others.<br /><br />The bonus disc on this edition, Scorsese on Scorsese is interesting and the rare kind of bonus material you can actually enjoy.<br /><br />If you don't laugh at Baldwin's manic smoke break rant, you need to lighten up. What, are you some kinda fitness freak?!
B00C061I3K|5.0|Amazing album, I've listened to it every day. I refuse to take it out of my CD player. Random Access Memories features a great playlist. Bring Life Back to Music, Get Lucky and Lose Yourself to Dance are incredibly catchy.
B00DE0RQM8|5.0|This song is so fun and I just can't get out of my head, I think everyone should by this song and just dance
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I am so sorry the series is over even though it was 13  books lol.  The last battle was magnificent!  The book ended so much better than I thought it would.<br /><br /> Thank you Robert Jordan for creating some of the best characters ever!  Also a big thank you to Mrs Jordan for letting Brandon Sanderson carry on the legacy.<br /><br />I would love to see someone try to make a series of movies for the big screen.  I would like to see who they would pick for Mat's character.  He would have to be very special !<br /><br />A special note to Mrs. Jordan - I bought the hardback edition as well and it sits proudly on my bookshelves with all the others.  It doesn't bother me if the Kindle edition was late because good things come to those who wait :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is very fun and it puts a challenge trying to find a way out of each level and I recommend it for you.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I used this cable to log data from my AEM AFR gauge. It does a great job and is totally compatible with Windows 7.
B006WXW098|5.0|This well recorded disc from 2011 joins the growing discography of this outstanding young pianist.<br /><br />Yuja Wang, on this disc, plays a wide range of her favourite encores. Suffice it to say that these performances are spectacular or sensitive as appropriate and that none of the spontaneity of her many live performances has been lost in these studio versions. This set of encores differs in intent from many others such collections of encores. To understand why, the following quote from Yuja Wang herself may help to explain:<br /><br />An encore, as described by Yuja,is 'something that is both ephemeral and truthful. It's a temporary mood, reciprocated by the audience. They're pieces I've played for so long that they've become a part of me. It's a king of record of how my heart is feeling at the moment...... People assume that an encore is something showy, but, for me, it's a little moment of tenderness from the heart.'<br /><br />The primary intention of this disc is therefore, the sharing of the joy of the moment of creation rather than any intentional delight of showmanship. Nevertheless it is also true to say that showmanship is inevitable as a consequence of many of the pieces played in the program. Many the pieces could be described in this way and particular favourites will be chosen according to individual listeners' personal preferences.<br /><br />To give some sort of idea of the variety and range of the pieces and playing presented here, the Tritsch-Tratsch Polka is an especial joy as it was so much better recorded than the U-Tube alternative. The Carmen and Danse Macabre have all the sparkle and devilry associated with the arranger, Horowitz. The Sorcerer's Apprentice, arranged by Staub and adjusted by Yuja to fit her hand-size, is delightfully ear-tickling and, by contrast, the Chopin waltz is meltingly beautiful. The Schubert shows a wonderful control of developing textures building to an emotional peak in a surprisingly short time. The rest of the program is equally enjoyable and varied, finishing with a spectacular version of the Liszt/Horowitz arrangement of the Saint Saens Danse Macabre.<br /><br />The DGG recording is excellent with accurate piano sound and not balanced too close. There is a real sense of air around the sound stage.<br /><br />This is a very attractive and nicely varied program played to perfection and matches Yuja Wang's own description above of her approach to encores. There are also two concert performances of concertos worth considering both of which radiate the same sense of joy in music making. There is a 2009 Mendelssohn concert on DVD featuring her in the first piano concerto and the Piano sextet.  There is also an outstanding Prokofiev third piano concerto recorded at Lucerne with Abbado in 2009 and available as a DVD or Blu-ray.<br /><br />In the meantime,  I would suggest that this disc of encores deserves serious consideration as purchase optionnd varied, finishing with a spectacular version of the Liszt/Horowitz arrangement of the Saint Saens Danse Macabre.

0071624058|4.0|This helped me a lot during my TOEFL review.  I also used B. Stirling's Speaking and Writing Strategies for the TOEFL iBT (Book & Audio CD) which complemented this book during my review.  The Official Guide to TOEFL iBT points out how to take the exam, what to expect in each category and how the scoring works.  Although it is good to have reviewer books for TOEFL, they serve only as a guide.  Ultimately, practice exercises and reflection of your performance during the exercises will give you good success in passing the TOEFL iBT.  Good luck to those who will take the exam.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story impressed me with the high quality of writing not normally found in a self-published book. While the overarching plot is one that should be familiar to most, the characters used to demonstrate the change from inaction to action against the status quo are engaging and the narration doesn't allow the reader to fully grasp the mechanisms at play within the world of the silo until later on in the book. Instead, by presenting characters that have relatively little intent on changing the world, we see how the unveiling of a ruling group's deception affects individuals at all social (and structural) levels and which classes are the first to become frustrated. This is a nice change of pace from flamboyant, or extreme characters that must combat elements looking to dominate entire economies, to looking at able, homebody heros that are interested in a peaceful life until they cannot ignore reality anymore.
0066620996|4.0|What makes a great leader and, thereby, a great organization?  Is it the leader who has great charisma and personality?  Is it the guy with all the great ideas?  Or is it the humble and others-focused person who looks to their team for the great ideas?  Is it the proud who will be exalted or the truly humble leaders who look not to serve themselves, but to serve others?  This work answers these questions with as much clarity and decisiveness as is possible.  The author's thorough research provides insightful clarity about what kind of leadership and actions are necessary to take a company from just being good to being truly great.

B009NFHF0Q|1.0|I'm going to preface this review with the statement that I'm a long-time fan of Neil Gaiman and I've had the pleasure of meeting him at various Conventions and signings and I love him as both an author and a person.  That being said I was completely disappointed with The Ocean at the End of the Lane.<br /><br />This book was advertised as an Adult Novel and neither of those words describe the book I read.  The fact that it started out as a short-story is apparent throughout the book and the short length and lack of depth left me wanting.  This book is less adult in tone than both Coraline and Graveyard book which are both wholly superior novels.  Ocean may be a brilliant short-story, but it lacks the depth, mystery, intrigue, darkness and soul of every other book he's written.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Just leave this alone. I thought I was crazy. I tried to use it and it kept repeating the same BS. I did take classes for this, but after using, I think I should go back.
B000I186FW|3.0|Action movies, which incorporate &#34;good wins over bad&#34; theme, are favored by me. However, the references to homosexuality compromised the film's quality.

B00BI73CVI|5.0|With these words and a stunning act of grace, Bishop Myriel forever changes the course of the embittered ex-convict Jean Valjean's life in Victor Hugo's classic \\"Les Miserables.\\" In reading the novel one experiences heartbreak, wonder, inspiration, and awe as the best and the worst of our human nature are depicted. Tom Hooper's masterful movie rendition elicits the same range of emotions as did the novel. The screenplay is rigorously faithful to the novel's narrative, and the cast does a marvelous job in bringing the richness and depth of Victor Hugo's characters to life.  Hugh Jackman (as Jean Valjean), Russell Crowe (as Javert), and Anne Hathaway (as Fantine) are deserving of special mention.<br /><br />Much of the musical score of the Broadway play is creatively incorporated into the movie with wonderful effect. With the possible exception of Amanda Seyfried's Cossette, the cast does a commendable job in handing the demands of the musical score. The magnificent cinematography and rich orchestral soundtrack no doubt helped.<br /><br />I recommend the movie without reservation, but don't stop there! If you have not already done so, read the novel. Listen to the Broadway score. Experience again and again the genius of Les Miserables and its unparalleled portrayal of the triumph of grace.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It seems like most of the books I read, I usually figure out the ending, as the story line leads one in that direction.  This book was leading in one direction, and, surprise, it was the wrong direction.  As one can expect, love stories usually end the same happy way.  This story ends in an unexpected happy, lovely way.  A different take on boy meets girl.......!!!!!!!

B001F3FUK6|5.0|The primary reason I found myself revisiting Superman Returns (this time on Bluray), is because of the 2013 release of the Man of Steel. I've just finished watching SR twice, and it's much clearer to me what the newly released MoS is missing: humanized characters that we can relate to. Additionally, SR comes with the same powerful, moving score that has inspired millions since its 1978 release, thanks to the genius of John Williams.<br /><br />From the emotionally compelling opening scene with the space shuttle, to the ever-so-short clip of Superman pulling the submerged half of a large yacht out of the Atlantic Ocean, SR is a welcome enjoyment of triumph and goodness that makes me smile each time I sit down and watch it. None of the events of MoS were as momentous or as memorable as SR successfully delivered to us. Sure I had my issues with it when it first came out. Illegitimate children and that silly green rock aside, I wanted more punch. After having seen Man of Steel, I know now what too much of a good thing is, the latter half of MoS being nothing more than an alternate 3rd Matrix ending with a Transformers/Independence Day flare. The ending of SR is still a bit hollow, but it's nothing compared to the overall travesty of MoS. From MoS's shaky camera footage, jittery zooms, under-written characters, gratuitous CGI numbing violence, Hans Zimmer's turgid, over-produced score, and a general lack of any moment of true heroism - SR successfully trumps MoS with simple, yet powerful elegance. My personal take - the warmth, joy and enthusiasm that SR delivers is the Superman I directly relate with, although I may be in the minority. \\"Why the world doesn't need Superman,\\" the article SR Lois Lane wrote during Kal-El's absence seems fitting for the 2013 Man of Steel, because the Superman I love forgot to show up, and the masses enjoyed it.<br /><br />Superman Returns, in my opinion, is the best Superman Movie to date, followed closely by the 1978 original with Christopher Reeve. Bryan Singer did a terrific job capturing the presence and personality of both Clark and Superman, that gives him the human touch we lost in MoS. Over 100 years of movie making standards that defined the mechanisms for making memorably impressionable films were dismissed in the 2013 Blockbuster, leaving it cold and heartless with zero fun. Thanks to owning Superman Returns, I can reclaim what was recently lost and still hold on to the true spirit of Superman - a hero we can look to rise above the trials and struggles of disjointed humanity... to eventually triumphantly join him in the sun.her Reeve.

B00DF0POXA|5.0|&#34;He'll give us what we want, it may not be what we need&#34; are the lyrics to some up what you get from Yeezus this time around. It has one of his best songs ever recorded &#34;Blood on the Leaves&#34;.  Impossible to ignore. You may not like Kanye and he knows this because he shares the same sentiments we do. You can hear it/feel it in his lyrics and in the music. Emotionally complex, musically invigorating and one of the best albums of the year. Hands down....unless you praise Yeezus then keep your hands up, way up.

B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Sorry to say, I felt this was a boring movie. Daniel Day Lewis is one of my favorite actors of all time (There Will Be Blood is an absolute classic), but this film was very boring. I can handle dialogue and story driven films, but this one didn't strike a chord with me.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I don't think they could have done the movie much better. It stayed true to the style of the Wizard of Oz while at the same time making the movie feel new. It fits perfectly with the first. Loved it.

B007DIQC90|5.0|All I can say is get it and let the whole thing play out. Absolutely amazing. This is how music should be made in 2013.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a child in the 80's, which was a time of large bulb TV's and no programming after a certain time at night/morning, hence the black and white fuzz!  It is still a great movie so many years later as it sill makes one wonder about life after death.  I also love JoBeth Williams in this one!  Highly recommended!

B0053O89WY|4.0|The episodes are hilarious as always; however, there just weren't enough of them!  Previous seasons had more disks.  This season is down to 3 disks, which was a disappointment and is why I gave it only 4 stars.  However, 5 stars for the episodes themselves!!

B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is fun, challenging, and safe for all ages. I especially love the crown feature where it challenges you even further by having you complete every combination of stars available. I highly recommend this game, it is well worth $0.99. Hours of fun, my 8 year old son loves the game also.
B00993I6D2|3.0|I watched this movie as a follow up to completing the book.  I wanted to see how the film portrayed the story.  For the most part, the film stayed true to the story.  I can't say that I liked the movie, because it was depressing and slow moving.  The only reason I was able to watch it is because I had read the book.  If I did not read the book, I would not have understood what was going on and I would not have been interested.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|I got this on my blurry player using amazon I could not see it at all this app should only be for tablets or computers not tv.
