6304263465|4.0|1985: The days when Back to the Future and Breakfast Club were hitting the big time, When Katrina and the Waves hit it big with 'Walking on Sunshine and David Lee Roth left Van Halen for a solo career, this was also when those Toyota 4x4's were hitting the big time.<BR>Anyways, this movie is about Scott Howard, your basic average high school teen. Anyways, Scott also plays basketball on the basketball team, but the team isn't doing very well, well things are about to change when Scott turns into a werewolf, since I'm not going to tell you more about this movie because I don't want to give out the information right away and if you're in the mood for a classic 80's teen flick, I would recommend Teen Wolf and the movie is clean compared to those other teen flicks. <BR>Plus the music on this movie is a big plus, I just wish that they would have the soundtrack to this movie, anybody know where I can find it?
B00005QB42|5.0|The &quot;Essence&quot; CD is my first exposure to her music and voice. Not only is her music wonderfully soothing, (and the underlying drum beats sensually stirring), but her voice is very beautiful.<BR>I use this music, combined with gentle, loving massage, while lying in front of the fireplace, to soothe my lover's wearniess after a long, stress-filled day. The music is very calming, the stress just pours away. It is ethereal.
B000002KE2|5.0|Volume 4 is my second favorite album behind Paranoid, it has everything from rock anthems, tales of drug abuse, jazz, ballads and accoustic instrumentals. <BR>Wheels of Confusion is a real badass song and if you're a fan of blues/jazz rock, then you should listen to this song, the outro solo is awesome, it goes to show you that Tony Iommi and play anything from blues/jazz as well as metal, Tomorrow's Dream (the album's single)is a decent song, but a little too short, Changes, the band's early ballads sounds like it couldn't been done by Ozzy when he was on his own, FX is the album's only filler track but oh well, Supernaut has one of my favorite solos but Ozzy only sang about a minute or so of the whole 4:42. Snowblind (one of Sabbath's masterpieces) is another tale about drug abuse, Cornucopia is one of my favorite Black Sabbath tunes and it was on the Live at Last album.<BR>Laguna Sunrise is the best accoustic instrumentals I've ever heard. St. Vitus Dance is an alright tune but doesn't have much to it, and finally Under the Sun is one of Sabbath's most underrated tunes and one part song of the sounds similar to After Forever (released on Master of Reality).<br />This album is a improvement for Master of Reality cause it has more songs and the whole album is longer.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Not just the dragons, this movie flies by too, wasting no time to tell its tale.  Fast-paced and clever, this is the kind of guilty-pleasure flick you love or it leaves you cold.  I enjoyed it.<br />Like King Kong or any 50's monster-on-the-loose Harryhausen flick, you buy into the premise or forget it.  In this case, it's re-awakened flying dragons that devastate civilization and nearly mankind.  Now that kind of premise is so dopey on the face of it, that cleverness is called for to make you accept it at all.  Well, cleverness abounds here.<br />After a very well done prologue that sets-up the film, the rest of the action takes place in the post-apocalyptic world laid waste by the flying dragons.  A small outpost of humanity clinging to survival in a ruined English castle are upheaved by the arrival of a motley band of American warriors who don't run from the dragons but instead slay them. All sorts of mayhem ensues.<br />The direction is fast-paced, the actors play it straight, the set design, costuming and makeup is all first rate, making the whole thing believable.  And the special effects are outstanding.<br />I loved Kong &amp; Harryhausen and all that stuff when I was a kid, so I have a soft spot for this sort of thing when it is well done.  This is very well done and is lots of fun.
B000002KHH|5.0|Of all the Black Sabbath albums I like, Paranoid is my #1 favorite, it has all the immortal classic anthems and I'm going to rate it by one song at a time.<BR>War Pigs (7:55)<BR>A real badass song about the Vietnam and the intro part is startling. A+<BR>Paranoid (2:50)<BR>Black Sabbath's hard rock/metal anthem and it became the band's only U.K. Top 20 single hitting #4 on the U.K. Billboard Singles Chart and it was originally intended as the filler track. A+<BR>Planet Caravan (4:30)<BR>A slow moving song which doesn't sound like Ozzy at all, if you first heard of this song and didn't know who it was, don't be fooled, not a bad track and alot better than their 1980's/90's stuff) B+<BR>Iron Man (6:00)<BR>My all time favorite Black Sabbath song and their other hard rock/metal anthem, it's got wicked guitar solos and drum beats, I've been a huge fan of this song since I was 12 years old. A+<BR>Electric Funeral (4:50)<BR>One of Sabbath's most underrated anthems of the early 70's, and it has the vein of 'Iron Man'. A+<BR>Hand of Doom (7:10)<BR>At first, I didn't really care for this song but it'll grow on you after a while, it's a tale about drug abuse. A+<BR>Rat Salad (2:30)<BR>Not a bad instrumental, which really sounds like the intro to 'Fairies Wear Boots'. B<BR>Fairies Wear Boots (6:15)<BR>Another tale about drug abuse and one of Black Sabbath's well known anthems, too bad that it couldn't be on the box set 'Under Wheels of Confusion'. A<br />If you're a rock/metal fan and want just one album, get this album cause it really kicks [behind], as a matter of fact, this album is worth it for 'Paranoid'/'Iron Man' alone.
B0000039PW|3.0|EVERYONE THAT SAYS THAT ITS THE BEST CD EVER ARE FROM THE EASTCOAST. THIS CD HAS SOME GOOD SONGS AND THE REST WERE JUST A WASTE. FOR ME THE BEST CD IS ALL EYEZ ON ME. AND THE BEST RAPPER IS 2PAC.
B00000IMTE|5.0|Sadly, the opener 'Man on the Silver Mountain' didn't become a hard rock anthem like Black Sabbath's 'Paranoid' and 'Iron Man',<BR>Deep Purple's 'Smoke on the Water', and Kiss's 'Rock 'n' Roll All Nite and 'Detroit Rock City'.<BR>But oh well, at least this album made the U.S. Top 30 and it was when Ronnie James Dio tasted his first success, other worthy tracks are 'Sixteenth Century Greensleeves', 'Temple of the King', 'Catch the Rainbow' and the instrumental 'Still I'm Sad' (originally done by the Yardbirds).<BR>'Black Sheep of the Family' and 'If You Don't Like Rock 'n' Roll' sounds similar to Elf (Ronnie James Dio and the other musician's previous band with the exception of Ritchie Blackmore, the guitarist of Deep Purple).<BR>If you love classic rock/metal, then you should get this album.
B000000W5B|4.0|First off, let me say I'm not sure if this is their best album.  This said, it happens to be the one that I currently listen to the most.<br />Overall, its more subdued than 'Sticky Fingers' and 'Exile On Main Street'.  Mick Taylor is featured on guitar, with much accompanying piano and horns(sax &amp; trumpet).  Maybe some quiet after the storm.
B00004W510|5.0|Trying to decide whether this CD or \\"Music From Big Pink\\" is The Band's best studio effort is probably a hair-splitting exercise - but I'll go ahead and make the case for the so-called \\"Brown Album.\\" Although much of the songwriting credit went to Robbie Robertson (and drove an irreparable wedge between him and the rest of the group), the collabaration among the group was at its zenith at this point. And while there's no denying \\"Big Pink's\\" astonishing departure from the psychedelic norm of the '60's, the \\"Brown Album\\" presents a thematic evocation of America past and present that remains unmatched to this day - not to mention some of The Band's best-known songs, like \\"Rag Mama Rag\\", \\"Up on Cripple Creek,\\" \\"King Harvest Has Surely Come,\\" and the remarkable \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.\\"<br />But there's lots of hidden treasure here:<br />- Richard Manuel's voice was still a powerful force in the group at this time, and his work on \\"Rocking Chair\\" and the haunting \\"Whispering Pines\\" (this song's opening phrase is also the title for this review) is exquisite.<br />- Garth Hudson's contributions to The Band have probably never been fully appreciated - his synthesizer work was in stark (and welcome) contrast to the Keith Emerson/Rick Wakeman bombast of that time, plus he blows a very credible sax.<br />- Levon Helm's vocal on \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\" is one of the most heartfelt performances ever captured in a studio.<br />While The Band was never a \\"commercial\\" band (\\"Up on Cripple Creek\\" was their only Top 30 hit), their influence at the time of this release at the time was profound - check out Elton John's \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\" if you need any further proof. This CD (along with the wonderful additional tracks) belongs in any serious rock 'n roll collection, both for its historic value as well as for the enduring quality of its music.
6305736650|5.0|Just why is this film so good? First, pace and camera movement: incident follows incident in a continuous, seamless flow: it never lets up, and grips from beginning to end. (Perhaps only the flashback Paris scenes could have been slightly cut). Then, one of the essentials for great films, like Blood Simple and Chinatown: misunderstanding and faulty communication between man and woman. This is a sure-fire ingredient for a fascinating plot. Third, the wonderful battle of the songs. I watch this scene over and over again --- it's never long enough (another great tip: leave 'em wanting more). Die Wacht am Rhein is a good song, but nothing will ever beat La Marseillaise in the patriotism stakes. Something else another viewer mentioned: the Germans are somehow shown as human beings; charmless, of course, but human creatures of circumstance nonetheless. Add all the rest of the ingredients that everyone else has mentioned, stunning acting, stars, beauty, character, variety, ensemble, sharp and witty dialogue, humour, music, singing, colourful (b&w) backdrop, plenty of incorrect booze, cigarettes and gambling. That's the way I want to live! Somebody once called it hokum. It's a conjuring trick that hasn't been repeated.
6303471714|5.0|I really love doing this workout because I really feel that I'm working out. My pants are all getting loose. My baby is now 8 months old and a lot of people are noticing that I'm back to my body before, I even got more slimmer and shape my body. I read the Editorial Review and I kind of having a second thought now if I should continue doing this workout but overall I still love it!
B000069HKH|2.0|Being a fan from the 70's I know I am not going to be on anyone's good list after this, but here goes. This is the worst music put out by Bruce. I think the anticipation of a new E Street cd made people think it is better than it is. It is contrived, polished and sounds as though Bruce was having writer's block. He repeats himself too much and seems to think he is writing the music of the millenium. In future years, I believe people will look back and wonder what all the hype was about, just as they did with Milli Vanilli. I refused to see Bruce on tour due to not wanting to hear the worst drivel he has ever foisted on the public. To me, this is an offering to the almighty dollar, not to the American public as he proclaims. Bruce, Get back to your roots and leave the pr work to someone more suited to it.
B000002O51|5.0|One gets tired of the elitist critics who condemn and cast aside Boston as just another ... \\"corporate rock group\\" of the 70's and 80's. To listen to this album in its entirety (prerequesite: An incredibly powerful sound system) is a 38 minute orchestral rock trancendence. Immaculately produced and passionately expressed, this record is a masterpiece. In the post-grunge, complaint-rock, \\"make it sound like we're intentionally trying to sound like ...\\" age, this album stands out. Melodic and striking, this lushly produced, meticulously executed album delivers. A sonic tonic.

B00003CXXM|3.0|This DVD is being heavily advertised on television in the weeks prior to and following it's release, with an emphasis on the &quot;incredible&quot; alternate ending.  This is misleading to say the least, as it is simply a variation of the original ending that changes it in virtually no significant way.  So, don't buy the movie for this reason.<br />Here is what you do get:  Matt Damon as a likeable action hero with a conscience. A female lead that seemed grafted onto the script. A movie with many, many plot holes.  Good action sequences.  A car chase where the cars don't automatically explode when they crash (bucking the Hollywood trend there). And yes, a predictable ending.<br />All in all average popcorn munching fare, good for a watch but that's about it. If your tastes run towards spy adventures set in Paris, Ronin offers a much more satisfying experience.

0151008116|5.0|The Life of Pi presents itself as nothing more than a simple variation on the \\"road trip\\" novel, in which a character's physical locomotion parallels personal growth.  In so doing, Yann Martel manages to write a book which conveys the meaning of growing up, while balancing the future with the past, as well as what it means to observe the world.<br />     (DO NOT READ ON UNLESS YOU HAVE FINISHED THE BOOK!)<br />     As a boy, Piscine stems from a profound collection of opposites:  his various religious choices, the friends he makes, even his two nicknames (Pissing and Pi) all come from diametrically different areas.  The struggle between Zoology and Theology (which reflect the dual nature of humanness) is paralleled by the massive zoological garden complex, in its gallery of life, animal and human, of both the worst bestiality and the grandest valour.<br />     The cataclysmic event in Pi's life, however, provokes his transition from youth into adulthood.  As the cargo ship sinks, it comes time for the deserted boy to \\"put away childish things\\", and so the microcosm of his previous life (the menagerie of his companions) begins to dwindle, even as his relationship with his past life fades into the vast expanse of the pacific.  By stripping away the layers surrounding his young self (e.g., the animals, which in turn recall aspects of his previous life), Martel shows us that in order to grow up, we must perform that Descartian task of isolating ourselves, and breaking away of who we were when we saw \\"things darkly, as if through a glass\\".<br />     Yet Pi's remarkable tale does not simply end with the complete erosion of identity-rather, once the externalities of his identity have been stripped away, the opposites vanish, and he is free to build slowly and carefully his true self-to tame his internal tiger. Hence he and Richard Parker become one and the same, as evidenced by their simultaneous loss of vision, and similar recoveries on the mysterious island. (My best guess on the selection of the feline's name relates to misinterpretation [recall that the tiger's real name is \\"thirsty\\", so it too bears a misleading moniker like \\"Pi\\"], or [more prosaically] a park is like a pool/piscine).<br />     Like most readers, I had trouble with the two final episodes of the travelogue, namely, the run in with the chef and the island of algae.  Perhaps the meeting of the chef while blinded is Oedipal (as in like Oedipus the King, who is blinded when he sees reality-not Freud's complex)--a superior truth arrives independent of and superior to the eyes, which, ironically, only mislead.  Still, I do not find this completely satisfying.  (I wonder if perhaps this were a relic of a previous version of the manuscript in which the \\"true\\" course of events was never stated explicitly, rather it was hinted at through things like this and the line, when the Zebra dies \\"it was then I knew my family was dead\\").  <br />     The island of the algae is perhaps even more confusing:  initially, I found it totally out of place within this work.  However, with some thought, I have tried to rationalise its place:  in terms of the allegory, it must represent his return to society, and his need to continue to delude himself (the \\"truth\\" of the matter burns his feet and will kill him).  With regard to the final mystery, I am ambivalent about whose teeth lie within the leaves.  Are they those of the reader, who has also been lured into, and digested by, Pi's fictional worldview?  Or are they of some literary predecessor to whom Martel wishes to pay homage?  Perhaps they are those of the author himself, for out of his mouth/pen grew Pi's entire universe.<br />     Finally, I was disappointed by the lack of elegance in the explanation of the story (it recalled a Dragnet-type ending).  I feel the book would have been strengthened by building to it over time--I expect, however, that sales-conscious publishers forced Martel to dumb it down.  I also gripe with the story ofPi post-arrival: if he has truly grown up in the voyage, his studying of zoology/theology seems out of character, though this is a minor point.  At least we see his religious convictions have attained some sense of stasis.<br />     To sum up this overly long review,  I was blown away by this work, which I thought would be nothing more than a well-written (or else would not have earned the Booker Prize) piece of entertaining fiction.  What I found instead was a fantastic mediation on the life of the past within the present, and a counterpoint to the Oedipal need to seek absolute truth.  Indeed, with regard to our experience, Martel shows us that, in the words of Louis MacNiece, <br />            \\"There is no road that is right entirely.\\"<br />P.S.: \\"It is better to be late Mr. Patel than the late Mr. Patel\\" -- Indian Proverb
B0000028UK|4.0|Pearl Jam didn't waste any time on Vs. It's as if the band wanted to leave the multi-platinum [[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]] completely in the dust by writing better songs and conveying a stronger sense of self. There's a fresh and collectively hungry sound right away on the raging opening track, \\"Go,\\" which displays the aforementioned eagerness to sonically move forward. All Pearl Jam's early attributes that were so appealing to the masses are present on Vs.: a fluid twin guitar attack; Eddie Vedder's sincere vocals; popping drums and an overall no-nonsense approach. The song \\"Animal\\" has the same characteristics but with an element of defiance. Pearl Jam's take-no-prisoners attitude when it started was palapable and refreshing.<br /><br />Vs., however, is far from just a hard-driving rock album. Some of its great moments come via a folky tenderness that somewhat masks the darker themes and sober reflections of Vedder, as on \\"Daughter\\" and \\"Elderly Woman...\\" What's more, tunes like \\"Glorified G\\" represented a branching out of Pearl Jam, a need to creatively display the band's remarkable songwriting depth that, in my opinion, wasn't as evident on \\"Ten.\\" For instance, \\"W.M.A.\\" is not as in-your-face or perhaps as musically accessible as other PJ tunes to this point in the band's early career, but its more distant sound and ache over injustice in society fully showed and solidified the band's direction in the early 1990s, especially Vedder's. You could tell PJ wanted to experiment.<br /><br />Mostly, however, \\"Vs.\\" is an uncompomising juggernaut with heartfelt and hard-rocking songs like \\"Blood,\\" \\"Rearviewmirror\\" and \\"Rats,\\" all awesome tunes.\\"Blood\\" is an especially raucous affair, actually one of the hardest tunes of Pearl Jam's career. Also, the rhythm guitar at the end of the underrated (and underplayed in concert) \\"Rats\\" is vintage '90s guitar-driven music.<br /><br />Pearl Jam end the record with two excellent -- and contrasting -- songs: the rocking \\"Leash,\\" and the much quieter \\"Indifference.\\" Despite the songs' differences in style, they demonstrate what Vedder, as a star lead singer, had to inwardly balance in such a precarious manner: the weight of sudden fame and fortune against his humility and a genuine wordly conscience. For Vedder, all this was no act, and he's carried this integrity throughout his career. He ends the album with a negative vibe, but you can hear his single-minded determination, mixed with his undeniable despair. When Vedder screams, \\"Get out outta my ... face!\\" on \\"Leash,\\" you can tell the guy means it. Thankfully, he's come to terms with his popularity, while Pearl Jam's music has grown even better with each album.ence.\\" Despite the songs' differences in style, they demonstrate what Vedder, as a star lead singer, had to inwardly balance in such a precarious manner: the weight of sudden fame and fortune against his humility and a genuine wordly conscience.

0312305060|5.0|In Michael Cunningham's \\"The Hours\\" we are subjected to the marriage of fiction and historical appreciation at its finest.  I picked this book up because I wanted to read the story before I saw the movie, but I now know that I never want to tarnish the beauty of this experience by watching Hollywood's theatrical version.  Cunningham brilliantly paints a picture of one day in the lives of three different women in three different era's.  First is Virginia Woolf, famous and eccentric writer, plagued by her past and a mind she can't control.  While under the watchful care of her husband, who removes her from London in the 1920's in the hope of saving her from her \\"disease\\", she begins working on her piece, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  Then there is the present day Clarissa Vaughan, who creeps into the visions created by Virginia's mental weakness and helps shape the famous literary character, Clarissa Dalloway.  Clarissa Vaughan has even been nicknamed \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by her ex-lover and friend, Richard, due to her likeness of the character, which leaves one wondering, \\"Which came first, the chicken or the egg?\\"  Caught up in the middle of this weaving tale is Laura Brown, a 1950's housewife battling her own conflicts and reading Woolf's \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  Her gentle existence, though seemingly not outstanding at first, becomes the force that pulls the tendrils of Cunningham's philosophies into order and existence.  All three characters face similar battles; mental and physical illnesses (either of themselves or loved ones), the social barriers and private emotions of homosexuality, the confines of domestic responsibilities and expectations, the preoccupation of death.<br />Cunningham constructs this story so smoothly that it's hard to put down.  When I first heard of his book I assumed it would be somewhat awkward to read; shifting back and forth between decades and characters while trying to somehow find their commonality, but his craft is flawless and the story flows beautifully.  His style is comforting because it blends together new and abstract ideas with familiar detail and images of everyday objects.  <br />I truly believe that any fiction reader will be amazed by this book.  The talent of twisting a relatively preordained pattern of reading into something this fresh and intriguing is so hard to find.  I think a lot of readers will find some of their most private struggles and unnamed thoughts in these women.  This story challenges what you will admit about yourself and brings you a little bit closer to a truth that you're not quite sure is out there.

However as time goes by, Josh becomes unhappy and wants to be a boy again. This something you must see if you really enjoy Tom Hanks, who in my opinion is the best modern-day actor.

B00005ATQD|4.0|When EYES WIDE SHUT was released in 1999, it thus was crafted into one of the late and legendary Stanley Kubrick's most misunderstood masterpieces. This story of human fidelity tested by sexual longings is as universal as it is a jounrey into psychological self-discovery. For those who did not understand what the film was about were either lazy or naive: America must learn to THINK rather than observe all the time when watching films. EYES WIDE SHUT proves this.
B00005ALP6|5.0|\\"My Fair Lady\\" is one of the American Film Institute's 100 Best Movies of All Time. It ranks at #91 (should have been higher). It is the classic story of Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), the Cockney-accented flower girl selling on the streets at Covent Garden, who'd rather be selling in the shops. <BR>Professor Henry Higgins, played by Rex Harrison who won an Oscar for his performance in this picture, discovers her and her awful speaking skills and appearance, and boasts to her how he can make a duchess out of her. When she's taken in, it is a long drag trying to teach her how to speak correctly. When the time comes, the musical number in there is jubilant. The next day at the Ascot races, which features some of the most marvelous costumes ever, she makes her debut in the most famous outfit she wears in the film next to the ball gown. During the races when the horses pass, she hilariously shouts: \\"Come on, Dover! Move your bloomin' 'arse'!\\" It becomes a shocker to everyone. Preparing for the embassy ball, and during so, the setting is spectacular! Feeling uncredited after the ball, she runs off to Covent Garden where no one recognizes her at all, and her father (Stanley Holloway) is \\"getting married in the morning\\". Eliza goes to Henry's mother's place as Higgins desparately searches for her in a big mass confrontation between the two, as she thinks she can do without him as she goes away. Henry marches home angry in a quite odd musical number how he can do without her, but he's \\"grown accustomed to her face.\\" As he plays her voice on the gramophone, Eliza comes in and talks in her Cockney voice saying \\"I washed my face and 'ands before I come, I did.\\" Higgings looks up saying: \\"Eliza? Where the devil are my slippers?\\". The scene ends ther showing that she will stay with Higgins! Simply marvelous and \\"loverly\\" is \\"My Fair Lady\\"!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Wow. I bought this cd after watching a special about Christina on MTV that presented her as more than a half naked teen pop princess. And she really is more than that. Her voice is absolutely gorgeous. In my opinion, far better than Mariah Carey.<br />These songs show a more grown up Christina. I'm most impressed with the fact that she cowrote most of them. What's more, most of these songs have a positive message to them.<br />My favorite song on this album would have to be \\"Fighter.\\" I think most of us women can relate to a relationship gone bad that eventually made us stronger in the end. At first listen, I thought \\"wow, what a rip off of Britney's \\"Stronger\\" song.\\" But Christina sings \\"Fighter\\" with so much more passion than Ms. Spears has ever displayed.<br />Overall, a near-perfect cd from a perfect singer.

B00006879E|1.0|I've been listening to Maroon 5's first single &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; a lot lately.  On the surface I like it, but there was always something bugging me about the song.  It lacks *something* to flesh it out.  I thought about it and thought about it and I've decided that they need a different vocalist.  Or a lot of backup vocals.  I've listened to the rest of the tracks to get a feel for their sound, and it's very college band.  They have just enough groove and funk to get airplay on pop stations, but from the vocals to the limp guitars they're largely unoriginal.  When &quot;This Love&quot; started up I thought I had accidentally downloaded a Britney Spears track.  &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; would be a fantastic song if it wasn't for the boring, whiney vocals.  The rest of the tracks are slow and unremarkable.
B000002GKT|5.0|As the previous reviewers have said, one of the best rock albums ever. I bought it when it first came out, in the double album (that is 12&quot; vinyl) and still play it today. In one word awesome!!
6302794331|5.0|This version is delightfully amusing in the details of the performance, the music is well done for the most part, and the light-hearted attitude makes this a perfect introduction to teh classic for young children. Some of the original language, particularly stunning metaphors and descriptions, is maintained; and some information about the author and book is also included in the movie itself- and it ends with a urging to read the book! The extras on teh DVD are fun, too.
6304230109|5.0|If you're an Alice In Chains fan this is a must have for your collection (even if it is only VHS).<br />I love the CD, I love the band, I loved the video.  It has more cuts and \\"second takes\\" that you don't hear on the CD (since its edited to be near perfect).<br />If anything, it will let you see Layne Staley's last great performance before his untimely death.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is honestly one of the most moving peices of recent cinema i have seen. Jake Gyllenhaal was good in October Sky, he is phenominal in this film. This film parrelles with Fight Club in the sense that it shows so much about human existance and society. Donald Darko is the most disturbed charecter i have ever seen in a motion picture. His imaginary friend Frank is also the most terrifying creatures i have ever witnessed, and that is not attributed to his cheap mask, but to his presance his horrifying ideas. Please, i beg you to see this movie.
B00003CXXM|4.0|\\"The Bourne Identity\\" is a well-crafted, reasonably intelligent spy thriller that is akin to the classics made in the 1960s and 1970s. It has high energy moments, like an elaborate auto chase through the streets of Paris, but it eschews the flashy, over-produced special effects of movies like `XXX' in favor of greater focus on the characters and the story. While the plot has a number of hard to believe elements to it, it's still intriguing enough to keep an audience well entertained. <br />The crew of a fishing vessel discovers an unconscious man [Matt Damon] floating in the water off the coast of France. He has two bullets in his back and an odd little gadget sewn into his hip. The man recovers physically but is plagued by amnesia. Using the gadget, the captain learns that their passenger has a numbered bank account in Switzerland. Later, after making his way to Zurich, the confused victim finds out he is John Borne, American resident of Paris. It's more complicated than that, though, because he also uncovers several other passports. Is he Borne, is he someone else, or is he all of these identities? At the American Consulate, he learns one more thing: He is a wanted man whom some group wants to assassinate. Enlisting the aid of a German girl, Marie [Franka Potente], he makes his way to Paris. There, both he and Marie are in even greater danger. He establishes that he was a CIA agent, and, as his memory slowly returns, he comes to understand that he was anything but a nice guy. <br />Damon does a great job of playing an action hero. It's an interesting role for him, almost but not quite as multi-layered as his part in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley'. He and Potente make an excellent on screen couple, both in the action scenes and the romantic ones. <br />The movie was directed by Doug Liman, who also did the cult classic \\"Swingers\\" and the wonderful [and little seen] \\"Go\\". He brings a modern feel to an old genre. Adding to the film's appeal is the excellent photography, which was done on location in Paris, Prague, Switzerland and Greece.
0066214122|3.0|Author Michael Crichton's set-ups for his novels have always been inspired, if not fascinating. Anyone who has ever perused his novels &quot;Sphere,&quot; &quot;Timeline&quot; and &quot;Congo&quot; can attest to the interesting plot devices that instantly hook the reader, making his quick reads difficult to put down. &quot;Prey&quot; certainly falls into this category.<br />Unemployed computer scientist Jack Forman is struggling with being a stay-home dad while his wife works obsessively on a new project. Her mysterious project happens to involve work he has been involved with in the past. His wife is gone for days at a time and Jack suspects she's having an affair. He is soon brought in to the project when things spiral out of control. What Jack discovers at a remote laboratory in the desert is a swarm of micro computers, accidently released into the environment acting as a killing swarm. Needless-to-say, he has his work cut out for him in trying to destroy this rapidly growing menace.<br />I enjoyed the idea of this new type of monster created by Crichton, and several of the situations when dealing with this insect-like swarm were inventive and suspenseful. The set-up, taking place at a lab in the desert, is perhaps a bit too reminiscent of one of Crichton's early novels &quot;The Andromeda Strain,&quot; and the swarms replicating and eventually forming into people was a bit too &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; for my taste. The novel soon closes with movie-type situations in which men and women are running for their lives, climbing ladders and fighting desperately along precarious catwalks.<br />Which is why I don't think &quot;Prey&quot; is an especially great science fiction novel. Like &quot;Sphere,&quot; like &quot;Congo&quot; and like &quot;Timeline,&quot; the set-up is fascinating, but then it regresses into predicatable plot devices and chase sequences. The colorful hodgepodge of scientists at the lab are fairly textbook, and one can practicallypredict who's dog meat and who will survive. Thus, the suspense is never very intense nor inspired. Been there, done that.<br />&quot;Prey&quot; is half a very good novel. Crichton has brought a new monster to town, if only the story surrounding the monster was as inventive.
B00005JL2O|3.0|\\"Austin Powers in Goldmember\\" is the third (and hopefully final) installment of the popular James Bond spoof series. The reason I say final is not because the movie is bad, but because it's so entertaining and works so hard to tie up all loose ends that a fourth movie would have little chance of topping it. This time around, Austin must stop Dr. Evil from melting the polar ice caps with a device known as \\"Preparation H.\\" Along the way, he must travel through time, reconnect with an old girlfriend, reconcile with his father, and battle the insane Goldmember.<br />Part of what makes \\"Goldmember\\" work is that there is some semblance of a plot this time around. While the plot is still just an excuse to string together gags, it manages to reference events from the other movies, the Austin Powers mythos, and even toss is a few twists in the ending. Yes, the emotional revelations are played for laughs, but they resonate just enough to give a sense of purpose to the adventure, something that was missing from \\"The Spy Who Shagged Me.\\" The acting is top notch. Mike Myer's ability to play four distinct characters is impressive, and Goldmember is highly memorable. Beyonce Knowles gives energy and personality to Foxxy Cleopatra, and Seth Green and Verne Troyer continue to develop their characters. Michael Caine, in his limited screentime, is hilarious as Austin's father.<br />Of course, the series depends on its gags, and while not everything is funny, enough of it is that the ... bits don't matter. Thankfully, the screentime of a certain obese character has been toned down, along with most of the jokes involving body fluids. What we have left are clever perspective tricks, musical numbers, shadow play, a funny subtitles joke, parodies within parodies, and lots of celebrity cameos. All in all, while \\"Goldmember\\" doesn't have the originality of the first film, it comes in a very close second.<br />While the audio and video for the disc are both top-notch, I have to say the supplements disappointed me. New Line's infinifilm concept does nothing for me - it's a glorified version of the \\"follow the white rabbit\\", \\"007 logo\\", and countless other extended branching play options on other DVDs. What's worse is that it forces the extras to broken down into several little tidbits that aren't as long as they should be. Goldmember definitely had enough extras for a 2-disc treatment, and use of Infinifilm meant stuff was left out (including the Liz Hurley/Heather Graham deleted scenes). Other than that, this DVD is still highly entertaining and worth picking up for Austin Powers fans.lements disappointed me.

B00003CWOL|5.0|This movie, directed by Kevin Smith is one of his funniest and cleanest cut films.  If you liked the witty and racious comedy of Mallrats, Clerks or Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back(I'm leaving out Chasing Amy since it is a more sophisticated movie)you'll love Dogma.  Although I personally believe that this movie has wit and humor it is not for everyone.  This movie pokes at religion and the everyday understanding of God and the religion of Christianity.  Overall the movie is very well done and has a flavor that mixes well with the average viewer.  The R rating is for extremely strong sexual references, strong launguage and crude humor.  I highly recromend it.
B000002U9L|5.0|I have been a fan of this movie since I was twelve, and 15 years later still completely enamored with both the movie and the music behind this. My personal favorite on this CD has to be &quot;As the World Falls Down&quot;; a hauntingly sweet song that gets in your head and stays forever. I have actually had a friend have this song in their wedding reception and plan to carry on that tradition myself.
B000055X3U|5.0|This was the third Anathema Album I bought (the other two being The Crestfalled EP and Alternative 4). I found myself lost in what can only be described as aural emotion. It is the most sincere, honest and muscially profound album I had heard at the time, and I can't really think of any other album that is as emotionally charged as Judgement. The songs are phenomonal. Pittiless, Forgotten Hopes and Destiny Is Dead seguay into each other beautifully (i later discovered that they were originally one track but broken into three for listening ease). Make It Right (F.F.S) is in a differant mood to the songs before it, and it's bleak nature is a perfect setting for One Last Goodbye, an Eulogy of sorts to Daniel and Vincent's mother, who had recently passed away. Don't Look Too Far is my personal fave, and Emotional Winter is a really great piece, very Dave Gilmour... <BR>I have the Japanese Edition cd, with the Bonus instrumental track Transacoustic, and the album doesn't sound complete without this track.<BR>This is in my opinion (I have all of Anathema's releases) their best album. It is superior to Alternative 4 in almost all ways. <BR>Think The Silent Enigma/Eternity with beautiful vocals and layers of electric/acoustic guitars and you are on the right track....<BR>11/10

0446677450|3.0|I just finished reading the article about Kiyosaki in the February issue of Smart Money Magazine. An excellent piece, I might add.Having read Rich Dad Poor Dad, I found Kiyosaki's first book moderately interesting and entertaining. I don't agree with everything he says and I too wonder if there really is a Rich Dad.Regarding Kiyosaki's bashers, I am amused. I mean, Kiyosaki writes books, conducts seminars and hosts a website. His bashers attack him for this...BUT...they write books (albeit mediocrce, self publshed low selling books), host websites and also conduct seminars (albeit with amateur speakers and to much smaller crowds) but aren't they doing the same things that they attack Kiyosaki for?I also understand that m any of them spend considerable time ont he internet hyping penny stocks i.e. the enfamous PUMPnDUMP routine. Don't they accuse Kiyosaki of this as well? I know Kiypsaki recommends small cap stocks.It sure sounds to me like the  Kiyosaki bashers practice the same unethical things that they accuse Kiyosaki of. Only these guys are a small frog trying to make the leap into a big ocean.As far as I am concerned, I hope Kiyosaki fights back and then if we are lucky both groups will extinguish themselves from the face of this earth and then this world will have a cleaner, much cleaner smell to it.Nice article Smart Money. How about doing one of the little frogs now?
0312305060|2.0|I would agree with the reviewer who found the writing style contrived.  Worse than that, I found the book to be misogynistic.  I realize it is supposed to be a feminist book, of sorts, but it was far from that.  Despite a common thread of bizarre and annoying self-importance, all of the female characters in the book were sexually ambiguous, all were hopelessly tied to a lover of some sort, and seemed to feel little if any control over their own lives. <br />I understand this is a book about three women of separate times, \\"connected\\" by their similarities, but the (perhaps unintended) effect was to show women in general as unhappy, hand-wringing, self-involved, and unstable creatures.  Virginia Woolf must be turning over in her grave.
B000059Z8J|5.0|'Superman' remains a cinematic milestone, in my opinion, for its superb score by John Williams at the very height of his powers. A 'hot' property after his Oscar-winning 1975 'Jaws' soundtrack, Williams was given his head just as a stream of very bold and innovative blockbusters was in production in Hollywood. Having heard Williams' more restrained scores antecedent to 'Jaws', the picture that emerges to explain his distinguished output in the late 1970s is analogous to a musician who has been paying the bills with jingles for years whilst writing a prodigious and incredible body of unknown work for which he had as of yet found no demand. When the demand finally came, there was, for some years, no stopping him.    It's hard to believe, listening to the 'Superman' score in all its moods and variations and subtleties, that not a note of it existed before the commission came - instead it sounds like an extraordinary compilation of inspired moments collected over a long period and seamlessly interwoven into a cohesive film score that is indubitably one of the stars of the movie (would that Brando had made the same effort instead of producing the three-million dollar sleepwalk that begins the film).    One hears strands of Williams' other work of the time in the 'Superman' score: the 'Star Wars' jawa music in the bass-buffoon restrain of the 'Otis' theme; the theme to the 1979 remake of 'Dracula', which is basically an inferior reworking of Superman's 'hunting' music, which can be heard, amongst other places in the film, during the infant Kal-El's journey to Earth.    The score is sinuous and insistent, one memorable composition after another: the various 'heroic' acts of the main theme, thundering its way into the American cultural subconscious; the proto-romantic love theme of Superman and Lois Lane (just wind the poetry forward when it comes, or you may get some bad associations forming!); the unquieting 'hunting' restrain....and of course, the various comic restrainsthat accompany Lex Luthor's 'nincompoops'.    If other reviewers here rate this as one of Williams' best scores rather than his finest, it may be because it lacks a subtlety that would have been entirely inappropriate for a film on such a grand scale and treating of such a biblical, epic theme. One feels that Williams understood profoundly what the film -and the legend- had to offer and what it was about, where perhaps he may have been guessing or indulging in a little necessary transference for such off-worldly adventures as 'Star Wars', 'CE3K' and the various others he was involved with at that period. It was strong material, and Williams responded with one of the strongest soundtracks ever written.    'Superman' contains much input by various acting and technical talents at the height of their powers, never more so than in the case of John Williams' incredible score, which in my opinion he never bested, and which was never bested by any other 'classical' soundtrack composer.

B00005JKCH|5.0|\\"Spider-Man\\" as directed Sam Raimi, serves to prove that a movie can be greater than the sum of its parts.  There is no aspect of this movie that jumps out and makes the viewer gasp: the acting is solid, but not Oscar worthy, the special effects are more than serviceable, but not breathtaking, and the plot is entertaining, but not particularly complex.  However, when all of these elements are rolled in to one, you get a movie that is not just good, but great.  \\"Spider-Man\\" is a genuinely entertaining film that manages to avoid many of the pitfalls other comic book adaptations have encountered.  For example, it is my opinion that the X-Men movie took itself far too seriously, while conversely, the later Batman films weren't anywhere near serious enough.<br />Driving this movie is the acting of its two main characters, Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and Kirsten Dunst as his love interest, Mary Jane.  While some have argued that Maguire's performance was somewhat leaden, I thought it was perfect within the context of the movie.  Peter Parker is supposed to be withdrawn, a nerd really, and Maguire plays the role to perfection.  On the flip side, Dunst absolutely sparkles in her role.  Much has been made of her scenes wearing a tank-top in the pouring rain, and she is an undeniably beautiful woman.  However, she is also a very talented actor who conveys the full gamut of human emotion in her facial expressions.  I came into this movie not expecting much from her, and left very impressed.  The supporting cast is likewise solid, particularly William Dafoe in the role of the schizophrenic Green Goblin.  He deftly succeeds in turning what could have been a very cookie cutter villain into a surprisingly empathetic character.<br />The story itself is relatively straightforward, and will be familiar to anyone who has even a passing knowledge of the Spider-Man comics.  That said, it was no less enjoyable for its predictability.  In particular, the early scenes, in which Peter is coming to grips with his newfound powers, contain just the right mix of humor and suspense.<br />Finally, this DVD is loaded with special features.  While deleted scenes are noticeably absent, they are more than made up for by outtakes, commentary, making of footage, music videos and DVD-ROM content.  You definitely get a lot of bang for the buck with this two-disc set.<br />Ultimately, \\"Spider-Man\\" accomplishes exactly what it set out to: entertain.  It isn't pretentious, or riddled with `inside' jokes, but it also doesn't descend into slapstick.  It contains the perfect mixture of action, humor and romance, and combines very good performances from the cast with solid special effects.  In conclusion, I guess the highest praise I can offer this movie is that I can't believe I have to wait another year for the sequel to come out!<br />Enjoy!ch Peter is coming to grips with his newfound powers, contain just the right mix of humor and suspense.<br />Finally, this DVD is loaded with special features.

It has a jazzy sort of beat to it, with Roger doing surprisingly smooth vocals that can be mistaken for Dave's singing. lyrically such things as wealth like the line &quot;Born in a house with no silver spoon, now im drinking champagne like a good tycoon&quot; appear, hints of latter things to come.<BR>The last song on side 1 of the original vinyl's is &quot;Seamus&quot; I dont understand why so many people bad mouth this song. Sure, it was probally more funny to the band when they were drunk in the studio one night, but i dare anyone to listen to this song and not laugh. Besides, it does contain some nice blues music.<BR>Lastly comes the ever famous &quot;Echoes&quot; This song does deserve every bit of fame it has, its 23min long, musically and lyrically great, and will simply astound you if your new to Floyd music<br />Meddle is definitly an album for either people already fans of Floyd, or trying their 1st Floyd music, so try it one day.

B0000640VO|1.0|The filmmakers seem desperate to capture the viewer's attention. Perhaps I should have been impressed by the use of bold colors and surprised by the presentational style. But I wasn't. Unfortunately, those gimmicks don't distract from the thin storyline and beige characters: quirky gal looks for Mr. Right and interacts with her eccentric friends.

B00005JL3A|1.0|The Resident Evil movie: yet another example of why Hollywood never seems to make a good game based movie. I would fall backwards in shock if I found out the film's director had actually PLAYED the games, or just had someone play them for him and explain what happens. Why does this movie throw any sort of continuity from the games out the window? Why are none of the characters from the game are here? The original Residant Evil had a perfect plot for a horror movie. The Special Tactics and Rescue Squad gets stuck in a mansion full of Zombies, Mutant Dogs, Frogs, Spiders, Bees, Sharks, you name it, they've got it, and an excellent character cast to go with it. Instead, they chuck it all out except for the mansion, the Zombies, the dogs, and the Licker from Resident Evil 2. And gore wise, it's pretty clean compared to the games. Heck, it probably wouldn't even be rated R if they didn't throw in Milla Jovovich's nude scenes to boost up the rating. *sigh*...
B00005RIKI|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd's 1973 debut is no less than a classic rock album. A classic classic rock album. Eight songs, all of them great. Prime riff-rockers (Gimme Three Steps, I Ain't The One, Simple Man) one of the best rock ballads ever (Tuesday's Gone) and one genuine all-time classic song (Freebird). But the lesser known songs are great too. Things Goin' On, Mississippi Kid and Poison Whiskey are all fine songs. Not a weak spot on the whole album. In an era where great rock albums where everywhere, Pronounced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd stands distinguished. The follow-up, Second Helping, is just as good as this one, if not better. Personally, I have a particular fondness for Pronounced over Second Helping. Both are excellent though, and belong in any hard rock collection.<br />This new remastered version is great also. I had the older release and this one is superior. In addition to the bonus tracks, there is also improvement in sound quality and thorough liner notes and song details.

Director Rob Marshall has chosen Al Capone's Chicago as the backdrop for a musical based on a series of court trials of otherwise good women who kill their cheating or otherwise abusive spouses. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Velma Kelly, a brash-talking brunette who kills her sister and husband for having an affair and, without missing a beat, goes back to work singing and dancing up a storm.  Watching her perform is Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart, who has just plugged her own lover for lying about a promise to introduce her to a talent agent.  While all this shooting is going on, the details of this dancing duo's past is recounted in the oddest of ways.  Director Marshall slips the viewer in and out of reality by superimposing song and dance routines that highlight the details of their respective cases.  These routines are magnificent and quite carry the viewer along with their sheer kinetic energy. Queen Latifah is the dyke prison guard known as Momma, who has her own show stopping tunes.  Richard Gere is the sleazy lawyer Billy Byrne who not only defends Zeta-Jones and Zellweger, but also brags about his never having lost a case.  By the time the closing credits roll, the viewer learns how he has managed that little trick.  The entire film is an opulent non-stop ensemble of song and dance that masks a core of blatant nihilism.  It is no coincidence that Capone's Chicago is the setting.  Few cities in American history had been as criminally wide open as Chicago.  Capone was but the tip of moral vacuum iceberg through which nearly every character in the movie is more flawed than one cares to see initially.  Zeta-Jones kills two people, and her superimposed song routine brags that they had it coming.  In prison, she establishes that she is at the top of the inmate pecking order with a barrage of insults to the newly arrived Zellweger, who proves, in turn, that she can give as good as she gets by learning the ropes of the court hustle spectacle from her sleazebag lawyer Gere.  In fact, the difference between Zeta-Jones and Zellweger shrinks as the movie progresses, until by the end, except for their divergent hair styles, they are joined at the hip.  Gere warns both that fame in Chicago is the most fleeting of ephemera.  His warnings come so often that they form a subtext that suggests that even in the raucus world of show business, the end justifies the means.  I wonder that after having seen and heard the smashing tunes that form the bulk of CHICAGO, did the viewer ever think of peeking under those tunes to see whether any basic human values got trampled on.  I know that I did, and the cumulative glitz and hoopla that mesmerized me for two hours suddenly seemed crudely tarnished.
B00005JLRR|5.0|I feel disappointed by the poor performance of \\"Star Trek Nemesis\\" at the box office, and the fact that is going to do more poorly than \\"Star Trek V-The Final Frontier\\" makes me uneasy.  I even went to see the movie three times to see if I could help in its box office run.  You may think I'm crazy, but I couldn't help it because I found this film excellent.<br />The movie presents interesting events such as the marriage of Commander Will Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) -at last.  Then you have Patrick Stewart's remarkable performance as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, who discovers that his nemesis is a clone of himself; Brent Spiner also shines as Lieutenant Commander Data, the best Trek character after Spock, who sacrifices himself at the end of the movie (but is he really...?  You know).  And there is Ron Perlman (of \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" fame) who always gives his best, no matter if he is wearing make up; only this time, he plays the viceroy for Picard's clone, Shinzon (Tom Hardy).  Let's not forget the fantastic music score by the great Jerry Goldsmith and the visual effects from Digital Domain.<br />But then again, it appears that not only do the average audience didn't go see this film, but also the fans appear to have lost interest.  But I still believe that \\"Star Trek Nemesis\\", as directed by Stuart Baird (\\"Executive Decision\\", \\"U.S. Marshals\\"), is one of the best movies in the franchise after \\"Star Trek-The Motion Picture\\", \\"The Wrath Of Khan\\", \\"The Voyage Home\\", and \\"First Contact\\".  As a fan, it's a shame to see the Trek films go down.  Honest.
B00005JKBC|5.0|This movie is a perfect example of entertainment at its best. Nothing lacks: superb actors, good story, action, thrill, suspense, dialogues, magnificient pictures, exceptional camera work, great focus, good variety and choice of locations, good soundtrack, happy end with a morale... this movie was just made in quality. It's really close to perfection at its best.<BR>Also, contrary to some other movies where the course of the story may be difficult to follow, in this one, the story unfolds in a very clear, pleasant way (even though the scenario is not simple, dealing with several places in time and space).<BR>What I liked very much, infact, is the story itself, the gentlemanship of Nathan, who is so devoted to save his ex-partner Tom; he manages to save Tom by himself at his own risks, as the CIA stops for fear of political incidents.<BR>So this movie is not only well filmed, it is also showing some of the good sides of human nature, which definitely adds to the pleasure.
B0000028PL|5.0|All of the Living Colour albums are great in their own way, and &quot;Stain&quot; is no excpetion.  The songs are catchy, lyrics are great, and the talent each band member has is expressed in each song.  I agree that this is probably the &quot;hardest&quot; of all their albums, which is why it is my favorite LC album.  And now is the time to experience Living Colour again for the first time; the band has re-grouped and have been playing gigs across the U.S.  They have signed a record deal and are putting the final touches on a NEW ALBUM! They have been including many songs from &quot;Stain&quot; in their set lists, which is yet another reason why any true rock fan should consider this album.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|I do not like this movie, because the story is very sad. Pearce builds an amazing time machine to get back into the past and revive his girlfriend who had been shot, for her ring; however she dies again from an accident. Finally something wrong happens and Pearce is projected into the future, at a time when a strange but technically adavanced civilization manages to blow up the moon by mistake; the effect is disastrous for the Earth's climate and for mankind. So Pearce goes even further into the future and finally reaches a very remote time, when civilization has been nealry completely wiped out of the surface of the Earth. Strange mnsters inhabit the Earth's undergound caves and use humans as food. The end of the movie is very disappointing, as the time machine explodes and Pearce cannot escape from the future; because of that he will never be able to revive his dead girlfriend. It is a sad end, but this movie is not a good one anyway.
B00000JLWW|5.0|when i first saw Titanic back in the 6th grade (god it that was 5 years ago) i fell in love with it. I thought it was wonderful. I used to love around that time readin about shipwrecks especially the Titanic. I read all the facts books stories everything. This was the only film i saw on opening night. I knew the main charcaters were fictional but i was drawn in by the wonderful chemistry by Dicaprio Winslet. It rightfully deserves the 11 acadamey awards and its spot on afis 100 greatest thrills list. James Cameron deserves credit for his audacity in making this movie. Those shots of the Titanic are so beautiful how can you deny them. The sinking and the scene where the ship splits into two are masterworks. The soundtrack is unforgettable are wondefully placed. I remember seeing this on every channel for the longest time. There was always something about the Titanic on. Documentaries, Celine Dion's song, there was always something about the Titanic on. You could find it on video everywhere. This film is for the ages. I saw it a second time a few weeks later and i loved it even more. I can never forget this movie ever. It will be with me for as long as i live. Long live Titanic the most popular movie in motion picture history.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I will say that this album is one of the more enjoyable I own. It's got just about everything and can really fit with whatever mood you're in - it definitely has listenability. It's NOTHING like Pink's first album and it really feels like she was able to just put so much more into this record. <br />Missundaztood - This really upbeat track is a good way to kick off the album, although I have to admit that I sometimes skip to the next track. It's a bit repetitive and if you're like me a really enjoy, \\"Don't Let Me Get Me,\\" it's quite tempting to just skip it.<br />Don't Let Me Get Me - This song has slick lyrics that probably anyone can relate to, since we've all felt like we don't belong at one point or another. The chorus is really catchy, but the backtrack during the versus seems a bit overdriven. Overall, this is one of the album's strongest tracks.<br />Just Like A Pill - this is a really emotionally intense track, good to listen to if you're mad/sad, lol. The chorus sounds a bit like the last song, but since it's such an awesome song, I'll forgive it. <br />Get The Party Started - I'll be brief about this one - I don't like it, lol. I didn't even buy the album until I heard \\"Don't Let Me Get Me.\\" The whole \\"club vibe\\" just doesn't work. I usually skip this song.<br />Respect - Another song I usually skip. It's a good idea, but there's just something about the song that doesn't fit. It's actually a bit like the last track, which is probably why I don't like it.<br />18 Wheeler - A really cool \\"girl power\\" kind of song. I'm just mad that she didn't take the plunge and actually use the f-word in this song. \\"You can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck/And I won't give a...\\" It's only implied. :-/<br />Family Portrait - This song seems to be really introspective and I think anyone who's had their parents divorce can relate. Even if you haven't, it's got a really good message. Pink does a nice job singing this personal song - you can tell she means what she sings.<br />Misery - This song is one of my other favorites. With Steven Tyler dueting, it just rocks. It's got a good \\"old school\\" vibe to it and the piano in the back is awesome.<br />Dear Diary - Another introspective song. Pink does a great job on this one too; her voice is more mellow and she proves she can pull that off too. <br />Eventually - Another more mellow song; it makes me wonder if they should have put it right after \\"Dear Diary.\\" It's got very few other instruments on it, which is pretty nice. Her voice really stands out on this track.<br />Lonely Girl - Still more of a mellow vibe. They definitely should have spaced these out a little better. :-/ The chorus is really the redeeming quality on this song; the intro sounds A LOT like \\"Eventually,\\" which irritates me.<br />Numb - This is a really good pick-up after all the mellow songs, lol. This song is cool, it has a really angst driven kind of vibe. <br />Gone To California - Really meaningful lyrics on this one. It really draws attention to problems in the world - it's nice to have a contemporary popular artist singing about something BESIDES love, lol.<br />My Vietnam - Perfect way to end this album. Like the last track, it talks about real issues in both the world and her life. She sort of almost talks over the music, not really sings, but it's forgivable since the concept of the song is so cool. <br />OVERALL - The first half of the album has songs with mostly more upbeat backtracks, while the last half is much more mellow; this can be good or bad, I guess. Personally, I don't really like the order of the songs, I think they could have spaced it out a bit better, but that's just me. Some of the songs sound a bit the same; I think she definitely could have explored a bit more musical territory with this album. I also really do not like \\"Get The Party Started\\" and \\"Respect,\\" since it almost seems like the club vibe of the songs is forced. Despite these complaints, this album is still addictive. It's a huge step up from Pink's last album musically and lyrically, considering the last album was almost all basic R&B. It definitely seems like Pink's the one calling all the shots now. It's a great introspective album, although I think sometimes she gets a bit too much hype about that because other people have been doing that for ages and haven't received nearly as much praise about it. Nonetheless, it's definitely a good album to add to your collection and is definitely one of 2002's better releases.
B00006SFBD|5.0|well well well... the new album comes out and it's the same brilliance shown in blackwater park but a touch more brutal, and if that wasn't enough they still keep the melody!<BR>What's left to say, Buy everything with the name OPETH on it!<BR>If you don't like Opeth, go and see a doctor!
B000005HNQ|5.0|The previous masterpiece Mandylion was an emotional storm that left you hanging on at times. Here the storm has subsided but the music is still stirring and highly emotional. There is a sweeter quality to this album and the more laid back approach lets Anneke really show of that heavenly voice. All songs are very good and I really like the transition from Third Chance into Kevin's Telescope into the title track. The final track Shrink is one of my favourite Gathering songs.<br />In short - This album is gorgeous and majestic. Get it and fly away into the night with the &quot;nighttime birds&quot;.
B00005O3VC|4.0|The movie is great, an all-time classic! How can you not quote from this film? They cleaned it up a lot except for one small scene, so that was nice. BUT, it's not widescreen. At least not that I noticed. That's why I gave this edition only 4 stars. All the widescreen movies I've watched on my DVD player have the black bands on top and bottom; isn't that what widescreen is, so that the whole film fits on your square-screened TV? My version of this DVD does not have these features -- does that mean it's not really a widescreen edition? Help me out here, or I'm returning this thing pronto! (And yes, I know how to work my DVD player)
B000002U82|5.0|I am a true Pink Floyd fan.  I own every album from 1967s Piper at the Gates of Dawn through 1995s Pulse (and that includes work they did for Zabriskie Point, their Live @ Pompeii concert, and a compilation of rarities).  While I don't think Dark Side is my favorite Floyd album (that standing goes to a tie between Atom Heart Mother and Animals), it is still a killer record.  Every time I put it on the turntable (yes, I still have one), I can't just turn it off.  I listen to the entire thing, because Floyd was definitely an album-based band.  Also, in case you didn't know: the whole thing is timed damn-near perfectly with &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, so if you hit play after the third lion roar, you'll be in for a real treat (my personal favorite part is when the witch of the west shows up on her bicycle, the clocks and chimes at the beginning of &quot;Time&quot; start going crazy.  The rest of it works well too.)
B00000JLWW|5.0|I write this review principally for those who have vowed to never watch Titanic.  No fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, I used to be one of those people; then, on the spur of the moment, I felt compelled to buy it and watch it.  I am so thankful I responded to that sudden urge because this is truly the most moving motion picture I have ever seen.  I immediately fell in love with every single thing about it, even the love story of Jack and Rose.  I know this film cost a fortune and took forever to make, but every cent James Cameron spent was worth it.  Titanic is incredible.  There were really no Jack and Rose onboard the ship on the night it went down, but their story opens our hearts to the real story of that great tragedy, the fact that hundreds and hundreds of very real people from all walks of life suffered and died in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic.  When we think of some of the lives that were lost, we too often see them not as people but as myths-the unsinkable Molly Brown, Captain Smith, the scoundrel Ismay, John Jacob Astor, the Guggenheims, the musicians on deck, etc.  In this epic, we see the humanity of everyone on board, from the first class passengers to the third class folks below deck to the hard-working men in the pits of the ship who bravely kept the lights on for so long in the face of certain death.  This motion picture reinforces the humanity of every soul lost, for that is where the real tragedy lies.<br />Some people don't like the love story in the film, but I found it magical.  DiCaprio, as much as I hate to admit it, is an incredibly talented actor, but it is really Kate Winslet who shines the brightest in my eyes.  The complexity of Rose, engaged to wealth and status but yearning for something real that cannot be bought, calls out to the humanity in all of us, and we delight in her forbidden romance with the poor and socially inferior Jack Dawson, ready to take up arms ourselves against her rogue of a fianc&eacute; and his dastardly henchman.  Some of the purity of this love was lost for me inside the car in the storage room, but no one can deny the power of Rose's love for Jack when she sacrifices her own survival to stay by his side.  This is the kind of all-encompassing love we all seek but a rare few of us ever find.<br />Equally powerful is the extraordinary presentation of the Titanic's final hour.  One feels as if he is actually there feeling the shudders as the iceberg rips through the great ship's hull, detecting the list of the decks as the front section begins to settle under water, watching with fascinating unbelief the water as it begins its climb from the lower to upper decks, getting a sense of the complete and utter panic that ensues once Titanic's fate becomes clear to all onboard, and watching numbly from afar as the smokestacks break off, the hull splits, and the fractured ship dives beneath the waves en route to its eternal resting place.  The surreal aspect of it all, with the music playing in the background while brave men say a final goodbye to their wives and children in the lifeboats and less fortunate men, women, and children stop to embrace death in whatever way they can, is truly magical and tugs at the heart-strings of anyone professing to be human.<br />The incredible music accompanying this film is also intensely moving, whether it is reinforcing the passion of true love newly found or lamenting the tragedy of souls lost.  If the love story and tragedy do not bring tears to your eyes, the extraordinary music will.  I wonder how many men in particular sat through all of the closing credits in the theatre hoping their tears would dry before the lights came back on.  The ending is to my eyes absolutely perfect and truly beautiful.  This movie affects me greatly no matter how many times I have already watched it.  I hope that some of those individuals vowing never to watch Titanic will reconsider their decision; I feel sure that many unbelievers would find themselves as captivated and completely in love with this motion picture as I am upon experiencing it.vated and completely in love with this motion picture as I am upon experiencing it.
B00002SWEM|4.0|To the reviewer who saw a pan and scan version... Either flip the disk over or stop buying wildcat copies.  The disk is a 2-sided single layer disk.  One side is widescreen the other side pan &amp; scan.  If you received a disk that played only in pan &amp; scan, it is probably an illegal copy.
0783226845|4.0|Mr. Pacino, who has not been a favorite actor of mine, gives a powerful and compelling display of his acting abilities as a blind, embittered, retired army officer bent on destroying himself. Chris O'Donnel also shines in his role of the young student weighed down by a decision he must make which could destroy his future. The two spend an upsetting, uplifting, emotional Thanksgiving weekend together which ultimately leads to a very satisfying conclusion. Truly a delight to watch.
B000008COG|4.0|I didn't expect a whole lot when I picked up this album just recently due to the negative reviews and bad sales. This album, however, is just as good as many AC/DC albums of the Brian era. It does not reach the peak of Brian with Back In Black and doesn't touch any of Bon's work in terms of greatness, but I still love it for its different and darker sound. <br />A run-through of the songs-<br />Heatseaker: A little overated, catchy and crunchy guitar solo but the chorus doesn't hook you like it should. <BR>That's The Way I Wanna Rock'N'Roll: An absolute classic! I don't care if this song was trying to be an anthem (ala For Those About.., It's A Long Way To The Top...), the riff is killer and the backround vocals kick some butt. <BR>Meanstreak:Great and features some great writing! Not as rocking but an excellent change of pace.<BR>Go Zone: Catchy riff, and good solo.<BR>Kissin' Dynamite: Not bad, not great but still gets your toes tapping.<BR>Nick Of Time: Great feel but suffers again from a somewhat weak chorus.<BR>Some Sin For Nuthin':Should have been on the radio with That's The Way and Meanstreak, features a great bluesy riff and catchy chorus and great crunchy sound.<BR>Two's Up: An excellent darker sounding AC/DC cut.<BR>This Means War: It took me a few listens of this song to really get into it, but I love it's fast pace (ala Rocker from Dirty Deeds) and relentlessness.<br />This album doesn't get four stars from me only because it isn't perfect and therefore does not get a perfect rating. It does rock though. If you want to sample the best songs on the album before you purchase it, I'd say That's The Way, Meanstreak, Some Sin..., Two's Up, and This Means War are the choice cuts.
0446608955|5.0|This is one of the few books that I have actually cried while reading it. It was so well written. I completly clicked with all of the characters. It was the type of book that you know or have known someone that resembles every single one of the characters. I have never read any of his books before this one and now I'm hooked on them. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this book to someone that wants to read about pure and undying love.
B000063DGC|5.0|Tribute is one of the best live metal albums of all time. This is Ozzy's solo band really in its prime. Blizzard of Ozz is iesly played in its entirety, as there are no weak tracks and it's one of the best metal albums ever. Also thrown in are some songs from Diary and some Sabbath Tunes. Had more material from Diary been thrown in like Over the Mountain, Tribute would be more complete, but as it is its fine. The band sounds just like on a studio cd, but rawer.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I first heard All the Things She Said, I knew this was an album I'd have to buy. It was just so cute and poignant and different from everything else being played. But this was a good month before the cd was released here and so I did a mad frantic hunt on all the mp3 search engines to find more stuff by this duet. What I found was the Russian language release by these girls. There are a few different track on the Russian cd, a few the two albums share in common, and guess what? After hearing their English cd, I like them both equally. Both cds are fun, sport some great dance tracks, and have some great down tempo moments. If you like 200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane, don't hesitate to look for the Russian language version-- 200 Po Vstrecnoj. You won't regret it!
B00005YW4H|4.0|A hybrid of soft country pop and light jazz, 22-year-old ingenue Norah Jones beckons listeners to be swept away be simple melodious tunes without the dramatic synthesized pop-beats of pop albums nowadays. It is reassuring that venerable jazz label Blue Note doesn't mold the talented Jones to be another Diana Krall but instead allows her space to invent. After the first recording of the album with producer Craig Street, erstwhile wedding singer Norah Jones decided the album wasn't the sound she wanted and roped in Arif Mardin (producer for Aretha Franklin) to produce Come Away With Me. The wondrous result is tangible from the wistful title track, sweeping ballads like \\"One Flight Down\\" and \\"Shoot the Moon\\" as well as the seductive \\"I've got to see you again\\" and the pensive \\"Don't Know Why\\".  With famed jazz guitarist Bill Frisell, contributor Jesse Harris and Lee Alexander, Come Away With Me is poetic nostalgia under Jone's husky vocals and evocative lyrics, well deserving of its Grammy nominations in eight whooping categories.
0060537639|4.0|This is an interesting account of the claims made by Mr. Menzies, a former <BR>Royal navy submarine commander and amateur historian. He concludes, from his <BR>study of 15 and 16th centruy maps, a large part of the world (such as Africa, Australia,<BR>North and South America, Greenland, and Antarctica) were mapped before <BR>Europeans have \\"discovered\\" these places, or at least before they could have <BR>surveyed them. He also claims that from the study of their diaries, it seems that the<BR> famed European explorers such as Da Gama, Columbus, Magallene and <BR>Cook knew their destination and have maps with them before setting to sail.  If so, <BR>where did they gain this knowledge?<br />Mr. Menzies' answer is that this information was obtained from China. In the early<BR>1400s, the Chinese admiral \\"Zheng He\\" commanded a huge fleet which explored<BR>world. Zheng  He's fleet have traveled 6 or 7 times, bring foreign missions to China<BR> and also trade goods. It has been commonly accepted by historians that this <BR>fleet has explored the South China Sea, Indian Ocean an reaching as far as East <BR>Africa.  Mr. Menzies, however, asserts that during the 6th sail which occured in 1421,<BR>it goes further. Shortly after the fleet left China that year, a thurderbolt <BR>hit the palace in Beijing causing a fire, destroyed several newly built <BR>palaces and the throng of the emperor.<BR>Facing many troubles and scared by this bad omen, the Chinese goverment <BR>changed its foreign policy, so after the 1421 expedition returned home, all <BR>records were deliberately destroyed by an official who was against these <BR>oversea adventures. However, a Venetian bussinesman Da Conti happened to be <BR>at India at that time,  and he took a ride with the Chinese fleet. <BR>Eventually he returned home, and passed <BR>the information to mapmakers. From these maps, Mr Menzies <BR>claims that he could reconstruct the route taken by the Chinese fleet. <br />The Chinese ships could measure latitude accurately, but for longitude <BR>they have to resort to dead-recon, which is subject to error due to unknown<BR> currents at sea. Menzies found a Korean map (derived from Chinese) <BR>showing Africa, and he claim the error on the west coast of Africa is <BR>because a current mislead the navigator. He further<BR>claim that this current would bring Chinese to Verde island in the Atlantics. <br />From there on, the Chinese fleet splits into three groups. Two went south <BR>and one north. The first two groups reached the tip of south America <BR>and made a survey of the area with Falkland islands as center. They <BR>discovered and passed through Magellene strait, and then reached Antarctica. <BR>The reason they went as far south as Antarctic is to measure accurately <BR>the latitude of stars of South Cross, to be used for future navigation. <BR>Da Conti's account of 22 hour night is thus explained. The chart they <BR>produced later guided Magellene for passing through the strait, and also <BR>ended in Ottoman Turkey, where an ancient map<BR>showed Antarctica accurately.  The two fleets then seperate, one back <BR>to east and ended at the west shore of Australia, then return to China from <BR>there.  Another going west and discovered New Zealand and East Australia. <BR>It then goes north up to Phillipine, but instead of returning to China from <BR>there, it goes along the ocean current<BR>and reached the west coast of Canada, and then from there to California, Mexico<BR>and then back to China. Finally, the third group continued from Verde island to <BR>Carribbean islands, then going north to Massachusettes, then north to Greenland <BR>from there they get near the north pole, then to Bering strait, and then <BR>returned China from there. Mr. Menzies derived these routes because the <BR>coastline of these area were charted on the maps he studied, and he also <BR>claim as a veterian sailor himself he knew the current and winds. The impact <BR>of these \\"discoveries\\", according to Mr Menzies,  is that they directly influenced <br />the European explores such as Christopher Columbus, who by the way togather<BR> with his brother forged a map he knew to be incorrect to convince the <BR>Spanish king to support his project, according to Mr. Menzies<br />As supporting evidence besides these maps, Menzies cited stone stele found in <BR>Verde island (but not in Chinese but in an Indian language), rocks and a strange<BR>tower in Massachusettes, ship wrecks in Australia, New Zealand, and Sacramento<BR>California, a strange \\"stone road\\" under water in the Bimini island of Carribean. <BR>The similairity in culture and language of some native American tribes and those <BR>of Chinese, folklore of native American and Australian aboriginal, and the fact that <BR>Asiatic Chicken, coconut, rice and some other Asian animals and plants were found <BR>in America, and the evidence that maize, sweet potato, yum were <BR>found in Asia before the Europeans could bring them there. <br />My general feeling is that this is more like an interesting novel rather than a history<BR>book. Even to a layman like myself, it is clear that some of the so called evidence <BR>(such as folklore, language and culture similarity) are little more than pure <BR>speculation. The ship wrecks,  even if they do exist, is not <BR>necessarily from China, or even from <BR>China is not necessarily from Zheng He's fleet. It seems to me that Mr. Menzies<BR>has such strong conviction on this matter that he simply ignored obvious<BR>alternative interpretations, and accepts only those which his theory favored.  <br />In the few places where I do have some knowledge, Mr. Menzies seem to <BR>make many mistakes. For example, he claimed that Chinese do not eat <BR>chicken meat and egg but only used chicken for divination, a custom also <BR>found among native Americans. As a Chinese myself, I could testify that <BR>Chinese do eat chicken and eggs, now as well as<BR>in the past.  As anastronomer myself, I must also shake my heads to the <BR>passages where he describes ancient Chinese scientists observed the 1054 <BR>supernova, pulsar, quasar and neutron star---Chinese astronomer did <BR>observe the 1054 supernova, but not the pulsar, which is the same as <BR>the neutron star, that could only be observed with modern instrutments <BR>such as radio telescope, and the 1054 supernova simply have nothing to do <BR>with quasar). He also claim that the Chinese fleet passed this information <BR>to native Americans who used it in their decorative art. Now although some <BR>researchers do speculate that an native America art depicts <BR> 1054 supernova, this is still in doubt, and I am pretty sure even if it is true, it has <BR>nothing to do with China: the 1054 supernova's importance is derived <BR>from its impact on modern astrophysics, but to the ancient observers in China<BR>this is merely one of thousands of equally striking phenomeneon in <BR>the sky which they duely entered in their logbook. There is no known art <BR>depict it in China.<br />Given the quality on these things that I am familiar with, I doubt the validity of <BR>the claims made by the author. Nevertheless, I found the book rather interesting <BR>to read, especially when the author deals with maps and the geography of the <BR>various places mentioned in the book, where he seems to be more at his depth. <BR>The later chapters are a bit repeatative.
B000002UA0|3.0|&quot;The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn&quot; was my first Pink Floyd CD I ever bought.  There should be a correction on the album &amp; the CD for it was Richard Wright who was doing most of the backing vocals, not Roger Waters.  Syd Barrett's use of the Binson echo unit gave him a unique guitar sound, otherwise known as &quot;The Intersteller Sound&quot; (just listen to 'Astrology Domine' &amp; 'Intersteller Overdrive' for good examples).  Water's Rickenbacker bass guitar work is amazing on 'Lucifer Sam' &amp; 'Mother Matilda.'  Wonder why he never improvised much more on the bass after this album?  When we think of the Farfisa Organ, it's mainly has that happy, pop rock teeny-bopper sound.  With Rick Wright behind it, he made it very errie sounding &amp; also is keyboard work is as well very haunting indeed, especially on 'Flaming.' 'Take Thy Stethoscope &amp; Walk' has that '60's jam band feel.  One thing that is interesting, 'the Scarecrow.'  It was that video (YES THEY MADE A VIDEO FOR THAT SONG) that made me buy that album for it was hilarious to watch.  The sound quality is not the best but then again, this is 1967.  The only drawbacks, no 'See Emily Play' &amp; it would've been great if they would've thrown in 'Arnold Layne.'
B000068IEU|1.0|This isn't horror, this is ....! Wes Craven's film debut is a primitive little production that rises above its cut-rate production values and hazy, grainy patina via its grimly affecting portrait of human evil infiltrating a middle-class household. This film failed miserably to accomplish what it wanted to do. This isn't scary, disturbing, or disguisting (except the \\"biting\\" scene). Don't waste your time or money on this piece of crud!!!
0312305060|5.0|The book jacket says it all: passionate, profound and deeply moving.  Cunningham weaves together three unique stories in an intrcate lattice that culminates in an ending that will move you to the edge of your seat. The Hours is quite simply brilliant writing.  I sincerly hope that the film adaptation of this novel will play as wonderfully on screen as the book does on paper.
0385508417|5.0|This book is great light reading for the holiday season. The story is touching and funny and reads easily. Yes, it does bring tears to your eyes, but in a warm holiday way. Perfect if you want to curl up with a hot toddie on a cold winters night and read a fun modern christmas story. Perfect story for those with children who need a nice break. I was glad I read it.
B000022TSW|5.0|Simply amazing. You can say that it is nothing but fart jokes and toilet humor, but it is so obviously much more than that. What Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done is created one of the most thought provoking and clever comedies of all time and the greatest musical of the decade. Not only is it truly hilarious, it is also one of the most controversial movies of all time. It is mocking the hypocrisies of the MPAA and the average American parenting, as well as many other countless subjects. Not that it isn't a bad thing :) I would have rated it the day I saw it, but I decided to look it over more carefully to see all the undertones that it contains. It is also a great musical. With the help of Marc Shaiman, Trey has created greats like \\"Mountain Town\\", the infamous \\"Uncle F**ker\\", the Oscar-nominated \\"Blame Canada\\", the Les Miserables parody \\"La Resistance Lives On\\", and the Disney-based \\"Up There\\". However, it is definitely not for children and actually holds the world record for the most profanity in an animated movie, with 399 swear words, 221 acts of violence, and 128 offensive gestures. This wanton swearing is objectionable, but that aside, this is one of the greatest movies of all time, and not even the angry parents can deny it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Hated jazz-type music until I heard Norah Jones sing. Powerful voice.  CD is worth buying.
B000069I3K|5.0|A wonderful feel-good storyline that touches both young and old.<BR>I bought this video for my two daughters and now I have purchased the video for my Grandchildren.
B00006AW2J|5.0|I bought this CD a while ago, and am very satisfied with it.<BR>All the greats are here \\"Salt Of The Earth\\", \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\", \\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man\\", IMHO.<BR>I love the guitar solo in \\"Sympathy...\\", the slide guitar in \\"Jigsaw...\\" and the use of mandolins and such on \\"Factory Girl\\". <BR>Just let me say now, that no Rolling Stones, or even music collection is complete without it.
6305603847|5.0|I have always enjoyed Pink Floid The wall; first as a vinal LP and then on Cd.  Now, of course, the film; and in 5.1 channel sound at that.  While the video was much plagued with noise in the soundtrack, this DVD is much cleaner in all 5.1 channels of sound.  Although I am unable to comment on any aspects of the video (being blind) I am asured that it meets the standards of this format.  A word to blind purchacers of this disk, the menues are accessed without using the enter key on your remote as is common for DVDs.  To access a menue choice. use the up arrow keys to enter a selection.  the only difficulty I have with this DVD is the commentary.  An Anti war theme is much to prevalent threw out, and it is not as technically informative as I would have wished for; however, if you can get past the rampent liberalism with which this commentary drips, you'll find a movie which is nice and dark and very enjoyable:  if only for the music alone.  Now, the 5.1 channel sound is just great on this film.  The center channel is not used except for what very few speaking parts there are and a few lead vocals.  The suttle use of the saround channels is quite effective.  There is no doubt that anyone who purchaces this DVD will enjoy it very much!!!
0060278269|5.0|This book was my absolute favorite. Sabriel was good and so was Lirael, but this topped them both. Abhorsen kept you interested the whole book through. It constantly surprised you and you finally learn the mysterious identities to the Disreputable Dog and Mogget. This book gave unexpected twists and turns and I really do hope that Gath Nix makes a sequel to this because it leaves hints that there might be one.Once again a great book great read.
B00006RIO7|5.0|In many ways, this soundtrack can be considered the definitive recording of the classic Kander and Ebb score. For those not familiar with the music, the songs are some of the catchiest tunes you will ever hear, each flavored with a little jazz, a little Broadway sensibilty and a whole lot of fun. Catherine Zeta Jones' performance is right up there with the best of them and she sings circles around Bebe Neuwirth's Velma (something fans of the show like myself didn't think was possible). She adds a sexiness that past Velmas could never reach and she takes the character to new heights. It was already widely known that she could sing and has a history in musical theater, but the depth and richness of her voice in the first verse of \\"All That Jazz\\" alone, is a knockout. Richard Gere sounds a bit nasally in his numbers, but it seems that he was going for an Al Jolson vaudeville style of singing. There are moments when it is a little annoying, but his performance of \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" is where he shines. And of course, much has been made of Renee Zelwegger's surprising turn as Roxie. Here's why: SHE OWNS THIS ROLE. Her vocal performance is enough to make you forget the most unforgettable performances by Gwen Verdon (the original Roxie in '75), Ruthie Henshall (London revival cast), and Ann Reinking (who probably cast herself on B'Way and totally blows in the revival cast recording). Zellweger doesn't have the strongest of voices and there are times when it seems her thin voice would be but a whisper if she were really performing these songs live with a real band. However, she more than makes up for it in sheer vocal characterization. There is a natural sweetness in her voice that can't be learned and lends many new dimensions to Roxie that weren't present in the performances of those who have played this part in the past. She's sexy when she needs to be, campy when it is required and all of that comes through crystal clear in her numbers. My only complaint is that the \\"Roxie\\"number has been shortened from the stage version, but she definitely works what's left. Her Roxie will be the standard for this role and I believe that the performances of those who play Roxie in the future will likely be compared to Zellwegger's. John C. Reilly's wonderful rendition of \\"Mr. Cellophane\\" should also not be overlooked. This song really needs the weight of Amos's story and is better within the context of the show/movie, but Reilly's performance is top notch. Same goes for Queen Latifah, who belts out \\"When You're Good to Mama\\" as if she were born to sing it. The movie soundtrack also actually improves the musical orchestrations of the stage recordings, adding more horns to \\"Roxie\\", a banjo track to \\"They Both Reached...\\" and really beefing up the crescendo of \\"Cell Block Tango\\" (one of the soundtracks other hilights). Those who are familiar with the stage recordings will feel almost like they are listening to one of those albums. The movie soundtrack plays ALOT like the cast recordings, in the way the dialogue is mixed in with the music. Fans of the show will miss numbers like \\"I Am My Own Best Friend\\", \\"When Velma Takes the Stand\\", \\"I Know a Girl\\", and \\"Me and My Baby\\" (though, the melody of Me and My Baby Does show up several times in the film and is the intro to \\"Mr. Cellophane\\"). But, what is left are the best of the songs and they all sound better than ever!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I abosolutally loved this movie, the message inside is far beyond any delivered in some time. The Dvd itself is not quite as exsqisuite, but still I thinks it's worth every sent.
B00000AFWW|4.0|This CD finds Courtney Love in a reflective mood following the death of her husband, Kurt Cobain.  It's in stark contrast to the other Hole albums ...this one is far more polished and commercial, and it leaves behind the grunge genre.  Only a few songs on this CD even hint at the anger of \\"Pretty on the Inside\\" or \\"Live Through This\\".  That said, it still contains plenty of good songs to enjoy.  The title track is possibly the catchiest song ever written ...you hear it once, and it never goes out of your head.  This may not be the Hole that we know and love, but it's still a cut above...Enjoy.
6302891272|5.0|After watching and comparing several films of Macbeth acted by English, I found this film interesting.  This film \\"Throne of Blood\\" was directed by one of the famous Japanese director Kurosawa Akira and is known as the Japanese version of Macbeth.  When I first heard the existence of this film, I wondered how can a play written in English be acted in Japanese.  The theme and the moral of Macbeth can only be expressed with the richness of the Shakespeare's word was my honest thought at the beginning.  But after watching it, I was just amazed how the director converted the English lines into Japanese.  He didn't take the English lines itself and just translated them into Japanese which a cheap director might do.  He exactly knew the moral Shakespeare wanted to express in Macbeth and constructed a new series of lines in Japanese.  Not only the lines were astonishing, also each shots in the scenes were just incredible.  Some people might take the scenes to be slow pace and boring.  But I take these slow pace scenes as one of the techniques the director used to convert the English lines to Japanese.  There are too many techniques I can't mention at once used in this film.  But this film is just incredible and is worth watching.
0312305060|3.0|Like other reviews, I read this book because of the Pulitzer Prize and because I wanted to read it before I saw the much acclamed movie.  It's a very quick read and there is a great deal of beautiful prose. But I concluded it wondering what's the big deal.  I also wondered what qualifies a book for a prize like the Pulitzer.<br />As a life long resident of the mid-west and a person that most people would consider &quot;normal&quot; I contemptated the characters in the book and wondered if there were really people like this. Are there people who live there lives with such pain, such bizarre relationships, so many painful memories of the past?<br />In many respects this is a book about aging. It's about people moving toward the ends of their lives.  Frankly, it's depressing. It's about people whose children don't turn out exactly the way they want and mothers who screw up children's lives. It's about long term relationships that are not always as beautiful as they start out. Perhaps that's just life.<br />Would I recommend this book?  Probably, but it's not exactly what I thought it was going to be.
0066211697|5.0|This is a subtle novella of 17-year-old Cécile, recently released from a convent school and enjoying a semi-dissolute life while living with her playboy father and his mistress de jour, Elsa.  She lives only for the day, and is untroubled by her failure on her examination.  She is looking forward to years of pleasure and irresponsibility, until Anne, a friend of her mother's comes onto the scene and endeavors to change, nay tame, Cécile and her father.  <br />The conflict begins with Anne's response to Cécile's throwaway remark that the young girl makes when her father and mistress adjourn for an erotic interlude, which the older woman found to be vulgar.  Cécile soon finds that Anne has made her (Cécile) one of her projects.  The plot thickens, much like the motif of the summer's heat and humidity in the southern France setting of this novella.  Cécile has her own agenda, including havig a love affair with a young legal student. <br />This simple novella by Françoise Sagan makes a nice story in describing how her teenaged protagonist reacts toward being tamed by the serious and possibly officious older woman.  All of the major characters are well-drawn, and we are lured into a sympathy for each.  It has the tone of tragic inevitability that makes the dénouement ring true; but is quite lyric and compelling.  Sagan rings true in her sense of the adolescent, and BONJOUR TRISTESSE makes for a very rewarding work to read.
B00003CXXP|3.0|Kubrick was one of the greatest filmmakers we've had. He made such classics as Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, 2001, Lolita, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket. He had his bad movies, like Barry Lyndon. And Eyes Wide Shut, which was a horrible movie to end up being his last. And he spent years planning on A.I. Two stinkers in a row, but to be fair, he wanted Spielberg to direct it and himself produce it. He felt it was more alon the lines of a Spielberg movie. And in a way he was right. There are many problems though. One is that Spielberg tried to make it a 'Kubrick' movie, which he can't do. It didn't have the dark humor or Strangelove, the coldness of 2001, or the creepiness of A Clockwork Orange. Nor was this movie cutting edge like Kubrick's work is (as he ages, Spielberg relies more and more on special effects and less on story). Second is that stories along this line never seem to quite work (see Bicentennial Man). The story is good on the page, but doesn't transfer well to the screen. And nobody can quite pull off acting human, but not-quite-human--the way a robot would. Not even an accomplished actor could do it, much less Jude Law. The story just wasn't great. I will say that the look of the film was impressive. The costumes, makeup, set pieces, and special effects made it a nice looking movie. All flash, no substance. It didn't even try to tackle the moral and ethical issues of a robot who has feelings. And the ending...well, the last 20 minutes of the movie was dull and should have been removed.<br />Thank god there is no commentary track, because I don't think I could have watched it a second time, at least not without months of space in between. The reason I gave the dvd three stars was a little to do with the film, but as a dvd it really covers the process of making the movie. Everything involved. And for the Kubrick scholar, it's a good dvd to have because a lot of time is spent discussing him. I say pass on this movie unless you are a film scholar. And even then, it's the extras and not the movie that makes it valuable.
B0000844MV|5.0|This is a great movie and a must buy for anybody who likes military movies, or just great drama.And now that its, comming to superbit with a dts sound track it just cant be anybetter.you know with superbit it'll have the best possible picture and should be cleaned up .the movie it self about men woking together in hard situration should keep you glued to the tv.and if you have ahdtv and great sound the reproduse dts sound you will be in heaven.
0792844890|4.0|Mel Brooks has created some great satires, his best being Young Frankenstein. But Spaceballs, his spoof of space movies, is also a good film. There are jokes coming every 30 seconds, and while all of them don't hit, many do, and there are several really good ones. Rick Moranis steals the show as Dark Helmet, and Brooks puts in a solid performance as President Scroob, leader of the Spaceballs. The effects are pretty good, considering how ... the movie feels (believe it or not, it cost 25 million to make, or so Brooks says). Star Wars and Star Trek have so inundated American pop culture that Brooks satire of the genre has become a classic (and he spoofed Planet of the Apes, Wizard of Oz, and Lawrence of Arabia among other filmsas well). The dvd is put together to make a funny package. There is a short behind the scenes featurette and a commentary track by Brooks. The commentary track is pretty much worthless. You don't get many new insights, and in fact Brooks doesn't seem to realize just what a commentary is for. Still, the film is what you buy the dvd for, and it is a good movie.
B00006CYAD|4.0|I liked Simple Plan back in June. Now that they are getting famous, it seems like it isn't the same. The cd is still good though. The tunes are catchy and so are the words. The songs are the type of songs that stay stuck in your head for a while because they are so good. I reccomend this cd to people who like good music.
B00005JLHG|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Factory Records, I think the idea behind the label was brillant and it was sad when they shut down. So I was very excited to hear about this movie but after a year of false advertising it never played in my neck of the woods, so I had to wait for DVD. After watching the DVD I have to say the movie in it's self as a story was a dud about half through - the Happy Mondays era (although I have to say that I never really liked Mondays so I'm a bit prejudice here). The actors were great (esp. the 2 actors that were playing Ian Curtis and Joy Division/New Order manager Rob Gretton). I kinda think it would have worked much better as a documentary than as a docu-drama and some of things that are conceved in the movie are pretty inaccurate. Although this coming from somebody who's a lot about the history of Factory so I'm probably being nit-picky.<br />However Tony Wilson's commentary track makes up for the movie's shortcomings. He adds more detail and history to some of major scenes and will tell you when a scene is flat out wrong. Which makes me wonder if the screenwriter and production people for the movie actually read his book (which will be here in the stated in March) or just took stories from various people and publications (NME and Melody Maker - Factory's two least favorite).<br />So while I do recommend this movie - I do so because of the commentary not because of the acutual movie.
0385508417|1.0|I love all of the John Grisham books that I have read.  This one though is full of characters that it's very hard to like.  I don't indentify with them and don't want to.  Go buy a painted house and skip this one.
B000021YQV|5.0|These guys know what they're doing. This is not an amateur attempt at music, believe me. The pure talent and energy can literally be felt when you listen to the album all the way through. If you liked what you heard on the radio and are thinking about buying this CD, think twice. Although it is a masterpiece of modern music, SOAD's typical sound is nothing like Aerials or Chop Suey. Try downloading Needles or Shimmy or Psycho before jumping into any impulsive buys that might end up with you being freaked out by the sometimes disturbing, psychotic screams that make \\"Toxicity\\" so unique within it's genre. <br />The songs I most strongly recommend are: <BR>--Needles (wait for when the song slows down for a sec and it goes \\"I'm...sitting in my room, with a needle in my hand, waiting for the tomb of some old dying man.....just waiting for the tomb of some old dying MAN!...\\" One my favorite moments on the whole album. Oh, I also love the line \\"And you slither up to me in your pimpin majesty.\\" I have no idea why, though.)<BR>--Deer Dance (My absolute favorite moment however comes during this song. \\"a deer dance, invitation to peace. War staring you in the face. (dressed in black).....a little boy smiles, it'll all be well, a little boy smiles it'll all be well!\\" Beautifully done.)<BR>--Bounce (These guys got some humor too. Sure, the repetiveness of this song gets old after awhile, but it's a great way to wake up in the morning.)<BR>--ATWA (Starts out slow, but doesn't stay that way for long. Best part: \\"You don't care 'bout how I feel, I don't feel it...ANYMORE! I don't see..ANYMORE! I don't hear...ANYMORE! I don't speak...ANYMORE! I don't feel...\\")<BR>--Shimmy (I love the very end of this song: \\"Don't be late for school again BOY don't be late for a again GIRL don't be late for school BOY DON\\"T BE LATE FOR SCHOOL AGAIN GIRL!\\")<BR>--Toxicity (Ok, so SOAD takes the award for band most knowledgeable about how to end a song. And this song does it the very best of all. I mean, the whole song is excellent, one of the best if not THE best on the CD, but the end is phenomenal...wow...)<br />It's my personal opinion that what makes a great album are memorable moments within each song that stay with you long after you take it out of the CD player. Toxicity delivers just that.<br />Hope that was helpful!
B00003CXXM|5.0|There is no question that Robert Ludlum's Novel is a fine piece of fiction.<BR>If those of you who are quick to dismiss this film, would take it for what it is...<BR>a well written screenplay and a very well acted film, perhaps you would perceive it differently.

0061040967|5.0|Another wonderful tale from Pratchett. This one is a little shorter than usual to accommodiate the format, but the great illustrations really support the story.
0783225792|5.0|Martin Scorsese teams up with his partner from Goodfellas, Pillie, and the two put together a fantastic, well performed, movie. The story is absolutly amazing. It teaches you so much, in an entertaining view. Joe Pesci is yet again, amazing in this flick, a less darker character then his role in Goodfellas, but none the less, dark....hey it's Joe Pesci. Every single movie Robert De Niro has been in, he awlays gives the fans an excellent performance. Sharon Stone, was great, although a little to great in a couple of scenes. She should of got an oscar. Martin Scorsese gives us his good old wholesome directing, something that you'd suspect from anyone of his movies. A great long three hour epic. It's a movie that you know Scorsese made.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|THE ONE THAT STARTED IT ALL! NOTHING MORE TO SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE! GREAT DISNEY! :)
0316776963|1.0|I love a funny read more than anything. But this is too distracting. Okay, he wants to go to Paris-- big deal. The first half of the book almost lost me. I don't think a story has to be so mindless to order to get a rise. There are a lot of other funny writers who still have something to say. Take Orozco's &quot;Delano.&quot; It's funny in the tradition of Catch 22, and it makes some important observations about society and education.
B00007BH5C|5.0|This is a great CD! My favorite songs are in this order 15-The Hornburg, 12-Helm's Deep, and 19-Gollum's Song. I reccomend this to anyone that enjoys instumental songs. Only one song has accual words that can be under stood which would be number 19. Any way this is a great CD I'm sure alot of Lord of the Rings fans will love it if they liked the music from the movie.
B00005JLK1|3.0|I was eagerly awaiting the theatrical release of this movie, just because I had enjoyed Dark Castles's earlier two movies, House On Haunted Hill & 13 Ghosts. So I was pretty disapointed with this third one. But first with the good stuff. <BR>1)I have never liked nor disliked Julianna Margulies, and not being an E.R. fan wasn't drawn to this movie because of her. But it turns out she is the shining light in this pretty drab voyage. She brings a nice piece of humanity to the rather dull role of Maureen and makes the whole thing watchable. <BR>2) The production values. Some nice effects are on offer as usual with this production company and the digital effects aren't over the top or especially obvious. Nothing ever looks studio bound and the rust and ageing procedure to the ship is handled well. Also of note is the reversal of the ballroom from rust trap to it's former slender - also very well handled. <BR>3) The opening massacre - pretty much the only real gore in the movie and pretty cool! A bit CGI-ish though in places, but a nicely directed set piece. Shame there isn't more like it. I also liked the \\"romantic\\" credits - throws you off nicely and it's different.<BR>4) Little Ghost Girl Katie's trip back to explain what happened. Fast paced, energetic and quite harrowing in places. <BR>5) The ending, Katie helping Maureen find her way. Again quite touching and nicely shot. Hints of James Cameron here. Made me think that with a slightly different play on the script this could of been a lot better and could of given the director a few more choices as it's obvious he has talent. <BR>6) No bad acting!<BR>And now for the bad stuff:<BR>1) It's about as scary as Mary Poppins cuddling some kitties. And it's not even especially creepy or tense - at all.<BR>2) You don't care about any of the characters other than Maureen & Katie. I know this is pretty common for this genre but it can be done and it wonders why such talent as Gabriel Byrne, Ron Eldard and Isaiah Washington sighned up to play such lame roles. A lot of talent was wasted here.<BR>3) Kinda dull and unoriginal in general, for this type of movie.<BR>Overall I will say I enjoyed it but i really was expecting more, which of course doesn't help. I had hoped it would of been darker and with a few more gore effects. Kinda reminded me of the 'Rose Red' mini series which was all sleek and no substance like this. But you know, after all my ramblings just see it for yourself as you may love it, we all like different things for different reasons.
0446677450|1.0|There is an article in SmartMoney's February 2003 edition that has shed some light on this \\"Karma Chameleon\\".  That is not an easy feat as very little that Kiyosaki claims to have achieved in his books can be verified.  Before buying any of his books, it may be wise to read the SmartMoney article and this online analysis of Kiyosaki.  The Rich Dad in his books may not even exist.  This was his response in the SmartMoney article, \\"Is Harry Potter real? Why don't you let Rich Dad be a myth, like Harry Potter?\\".  His books may get you thinking about your finances but without any concrete advice to guide you, the only person you are making wealthy is Robert Kiyosaki.
B0000028PI|4.0|Back to the world of concept albums for Alice, who brings Steven out of the Nightmare once again. \\"The Last Temptation\\" is easily the best of his Epic Records trilogy, and follows a story line that echoes the classic novel \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes.\\" Steven enters a dark carnival for which the price of admission is one's soul. Alice rocks more dramatically here than on \\"Trash\\" or \\"Hey Stoopid,\\" and harder on the song \\"Unholy War\\" than anything on his post Warners output. Also like most of the Epic period, the list of extras his heavy on star cameos (Soundgarden/Audioslave lead throat Chris Cornell's contribution to \\"Stolen Prayer\\" is a highlight). I wouldn't give this a full five stars because it lacks the urgency of his younger years, but if there was a half star available, I'd notch \\"The Last Temptation\\" up another notch.
B00005JKZT|5.0|When the Fellowship of the Ring came out, I was very impressed with it, but when I saw the Two Towers I was blown away. The second movie had all the elements of the first, and more. the action, acting, and plot were superb. some of the story was changed from the book, but that is ok. The one detail I thought should have been in was when Aragorn gets the reforged Narsil Sword, this signifies his right as king, but that little detail aside it's a great movie worthy of multiple viewing and a spot in my DVD library.
B0000630YA|5.0|Alice had ditched his band and was shooting for the moon when he came up with &quot;Welcome To My Nightmare.&quot; After the dissapointing &quot;Muscle Of Love,&quot; he needed to re-establish his preeminence among the imitators that started springing up around him (KISS comes to mind) and prove that, when it came to shock rock, nobody did it better.<br />He scored on all counts. By recruiting producer Bob Ezrin (who was sorely missed on &quot;Muscle&quot;)for sound, and actor Vincent Price for character, plus putting the whole concept on late night ABC tv - (Dammit somebody PLEASE get the DVD rights?), he turned the album into an event. At the time of &quot;Nightmare's&quot; release, there was talk of how Alice had revived showmanship in musical theater and what a brillaint acting talent this man could become, and how under-rated all his prior work had been, etc....and in the years after MTV, it's hard to remember just how outragous and new a concept video was!<br />(Just a warning: The three CD bonus tracks are from the TV show, and a the DVD audio has these bonus tracks in PLACE of the studio versions, an error that has yet to be corrected on the DVD audio version.)<br />This would all be Boa Constrictor poo if the album didn't measure up. The &quot;Welcome To My Nightmare&quot; Remaster shows how and why it stands the test of time. The production was far above ANY of the original group albums, and Alice was able explore his continuing fascination with gothic theater in ways his old bandmates wouldn't allow. &quot;Only Women Bleed&quot; was the highpoint of it all, providing Alice with his first cross format hit. (It also led, unfortunately, to far too many sappy songs later in his career.) &quot;Some Folks&quot; was almost vaudevillian in scope (remember the dancing skeletons, with Alice in tux and tails?), and the metal punch of &quot;Escape&quot; proved that Alice could still rock when it counted.<br />&quot;Welcome To My Nightmare&quot; is an album that spawned a million more (think &quot;Destroyer,&quot; &quot;The Wall,&quot; even &quot;Thriller&quot;).

B00004SA8A|4.0|As with sets in general, it is unlikely that it can beat individual performances by other interpreters. Kempff is no exception. If you want all the sonatas, by all means, go for it. There's probably no better set out there. But not all the sonatas are masterpieces. And if you can survive with just the most important ones, I would recommend you to go for Richter's versions. Once you hear them, you will not come back to Kempff, except for the ones he did not record. Amazing, powerful and truly deep interpretations.
B0000026T4|4.0|After the newly reinvigorated Alice came off the tours supporting \\"Constrictor\\" and \\"Raise Your Fist,\\" the time was ripe for not just a comeback. The time was their to conquer. Alice had a new label, Epic, a slew of fans who'd grown up with \\"School's Out\\" (Jon Bon Jovi and Desmond Child), and a pack of hired gun songwriters as his support team. The ingrediants were there to make sure that the New Alice was going to fit in with a generation of fans currently lapping up the likes of Def Leppard and Bon Jovi.<br /><br />The payoff was the biggest single of his career, \\"Poison,\\" the incredibly profitable \\"Trash The World\\" tour, and his best album in a decade. Granted, it ain't \\"Billion Dollar Babies,\\" but it gave the Godfather of Shock Rock a chance to work his mojo on a new breed of kids and nostalgic adults. Plus he found his way into the movie \\"Wayne's World.\\" How cool is that?<br /><br />The only gripe would be that there's a little too much of the BonJovi pop metal here, but pass on that quibble and relish the deliberate tackiness of \\"Trash\\" or \\"I'm Your Gun.\\" Thank God for TRASH...it insured Alice's place in the pantheon of rock to which he is rightful heir.
0028643151|1.0|This book is a farrago of errors, misrepresentations and exaggerated cries of alarm. It would take another book to correct all the nonsense, so a single example will have to do. <br />It is true, as Mr Moran says, that a large asteroid impact could at any time exterminate much of the life on this planet. As he also mentions, such extinction events are rare, occurring about once in every 50 million years. What he fails to note is that the chance of such an impact within the present century is therefore very small. <br />By 2100, our species will be exploiting the valuable resources offered by asteroids, and every one of any size will belong to some Belter rockhound, who will adjust its orbit to make sure he or she doesn't lose it to planetary impact. If we can make it through this century, the rampant human greed and capitalist exploitation that Mr Moran deplores will have made asteroid impacts an obsolete threat. <br />We will however face continuing danger from parabolic comets --i.e., those comets that round the sun but once, and then head off into the gulf between the stars. We cannot predict their appearances, and therefore cannot deflect them until they are already headed our way. No doubt there are fewer such comets than asteroids crossing our orbit each year, but they will remain a danger until our civilization extends all the way out to the Oort clouds, from whence they come. Mr Moran does not mention comets at all.<br />...Mr Moran has also written a couple of novels. I suggest that he stick to science fiction, since he has so little grasp of science fact.
B000006XSD|3.0|Something went very wrong after \\"Welcome To My Nightmare.\\" After the story of Steven and his trips into Bad Dream Land, Alice came up with a new character, Detective Maurice Escargot. The joke is partly ironic, since the album is something of a slug.<br />\\"Lace And Whiskey\\" kicks off with promise and deteriorates fast. \\"Road Rats\\" deserves its place in the canon of great Alice songs, but \\"No More Love At Your Convenience\\" was a bad call in the period when \\"disco sucks\\" was a rally cry for dissatisfied rockers. \\"You and Me\\" was Alice's biggest ballad hit single to date, but \\"Ubangi Stomp\\" was atrocious rockabilly. It was like he was trying so hard to be a diferent person that the album loses continuity, and ultimately, focus. Somehow, Alice forgot that the most important character in any Alice Cooper album was Alice Cooper. He bounced back from this album, but it's really the least notable disc of his seventies output.
B000063JZQ|5.0|Director Roman Polanski, who has produced horror films in the 60's, delivered an intensely dramatic, dark, controversial and disturbing film version of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Macbeth is the darkest of Shakespeare's tragedies- (witches, murder, violence) and in my personal opinion, despite the R rated material of Polanski's film, it truly captures the essence of Shakespeare's macabre Gothic drama. Polanski was actually convincing in this rendition, chalk full of the diabolical aspects of the play. At the time of production, sadly, his wife Sharon Tate had been murdered by the crazy Marilyn Manson cult in her Beverly Hills home. The deep toll must have, in some way, inspired the gruesome details on this film. <br />Macbeth (Jon Finch) encounters three haggard (and nude) witches who prophetize he will be king of Scotland. The ambitious, cruel, and driven Lady Macbeth urges Macbeth to kill king Duncan and take the throne of Scotland. When this is done, Macbeth does everything to keep his power, a cycle of killing ensues. I think, personally, that Shakespeare touched on Gothic suspense and drama. The supernatural elements typically found in such dark novels are found in the play. This includes the floating knife in the dark that flies into Macbeth's hand as he is about to kill King Duncan, the ghosts of Banquo, the ghosts of the bloody child and specters of kings, and of course, the witches themselves. Incidentally, it is the three witches from Macbeth who inspired the stereotypical witch boiling \\"eye of newt\\" over a smoking cauldron and ranting \\"Double, double, toil and trouble, fire burn and cauldron bubble\\". Lady Macbeth has a nude spleepwalking scene. Towards the end of the film, Macbeth is defeated by Malcolm, his head chopped off and put on a pole. The twist of the film, of which one must pay close attention to for the irony of the story, occurs when Malcolm, now the king, on horseback, goes to see the three witches in their dismal cave. This tells us that the cycle of tragedy and violence will occur once again. Deeply dark, intense, violent, haunting, Roman Polanski's film truly captures the true Macbeth, but it is not meant to be observed by younger viewers- certainly not grade schoool children or junior high. A mature viewer in college can truly appreciate this film and its Gothic fatalism.
0676973779|3.0|This novel came highly praised and recommended by people I have a lot of faith in.  The book was somewhat of a disappointment in that I was expecting that a book had won the Booker would be both memorable and enthralling.  It was only a little of each.  I would say it was more quirky than anything else - and the ending smacked of author manipulation.  Would I recommend the book to others?  Yes, but with a caveat - don't expect to be blown away.  It's a good read, and worth the time and effort, but it won't change your life or &quot;make you believe in God&quot;.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I would just like to note that i agree that it was very dissapointing how the movie portrayed Faramir as a bad guy. Personally, he was my favorite charcater in the book and when I saw the movie is was very disgusted with his representation. I was very much looking forward to seeing Faramir and Ithilen come alive, but when I saw it, I was flabbergasted.<br />Also, another thing that dissapointed me in the movie was when Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli met Gandalf in Fangorn, they shot him and thought him to be Sauruman, where in the book, they draw their weapons, but Legolas realizes it is Gandalf and yells \\"MITHRANDIR!!!\\" And I know that isn't a big deal, but it was a very special event in the book to me and is wasn't such a hostile welcome back.
B000021YQV|3.0|I really like System of a Down's self titled CD, I REALLY liked it.  This one, however, I can't seem to get into at all.  From the opening track Prison Song it just seems like a completely alien band to me.  This CD will undoubtably put them up there with the current incarnations of Korn and Limp Bizkit as far as popularity is concerned, but the music has taken a turn for the worse.  There isn't really anything memorable on this CD at all, the intensity and spontanuity from the original CD is all but gone on this release.  <br />This album seems to me like an obvious reach for money.  We have the radio friendly hits like Aerials and Chop Suey! along with songs that todays teenagers will get into because they will think they are crazy: Prison Song and Bounce (which I feel is one of the stupidest songs I've ever heard).  Where is the brutality of songs like Sugar?  Where are the awesome riffs from songs like War?  <br />All in all I'm afraid to say that the this band has polished off all their edges into a much more commercial friendly band.  Those edges, however, were what made the band so cool.  This album, along with Steal This Album, will shed most of the bands dedicated audience and leave them the fair weather crowd.  The problem is that even though they may initially have more fans the fair weather crowd comes and goes as it pleases and in time the band will be left alone, having abandoned the people who were there from the start.  A good rock album, but not a good System of a Down album.  A large disappointment.
B000067CPX|5.0|I wasn't a huge Chili Pepper fan until I first heard \\"By The Way\\" on the radio. I was skeptical in buying the CD, wondering how they could actually produce an album with 16 bearable tracks. But I was in for a surprise. This album is a smooth coalescence of many styles and genres, with strong vocals and awesome melodies.<br />1) By The Way: Incredible song. I love the brokeness of the lyrics and the melody is very catchy.<BR>2) Universally Speaking: A fun, bouncy song... got a little pop-iness to it.<BR>3) This Is The Place: Kickass baseline with a great beat.<BR>4) Dosed: One of my favorites. The lyrics are beautiful, and Anthony's voice is very strong and emotional.<BR>5) Don't Forget Me: I love the moodiness of this song.<BR>6) The Zephyr Song: A great ballad, albeit a little overplayed.<BR>7) Can't Stop: Amazing. Great lyrics, great vocals, great melodies. Awesome drum work.<BR>8) I Could Die For You: A very moving, beautiful ballad.<BR>9) Midnight: The orchestra is great on this song.<BR>10) Throw Away Your Television: Great song with a punky edge.<BR>11) Cabron: I love Latin music, so this is another one of my favorites. AMAZING guitar work.<BR>12) Tear: Another song with very emotional vocals. Beautiful.<BR>13) On Mercury: Fun song. Reminds a little of early No Doubt.<BR>14) Minor Thing: Fun to sing along to!<BR>15) Warm Tape: Very interesting sound.<BR>16) Venice Queen: This song is haunting, in a good way. The perfect ending to an incredible album.
0273659030|5.0|Barbara Minto has written a very solid reference with a clear focus on how to present your ideas in a way, which will allow others to follow your thinking.<br />The book is mainly directed towards those who write about complex issues or prepare important decision papers (MBA's, lawyers, etc.). However, many, many people could improve their writing markedly by picking up on Minto's ideas.<br />The book itself is very focused. There are two main sections: a) how to focus on core issues and b) how to best organise your ideas for others to understand.<br />Even though the writing is clear and the examples are excellent it is not an easy book to master. You have read it, try it, read it, try it, etc. Still, you will see improvements from day one.<br />The sections are excellent in every aspect, but some readers may find they are still missing some bits and pieces on the side. I at least felt it was very useful to know how to combine the Pyramid Principle with other high-end writing methods. Like when Barbara Mint in one sentence (correctly) warns against bloating out with very controversial ideas at once - the reader either has to take her word for it - or know some basics about storytelling. On the other hand it helps keep the book short.<br />I teach communications to senior professionals and can confidently say, that the value added of improving your writing form is much higher than improving your writing style. This is what this book is all about. So, if you write a lot of reports, memo's, proposals etc. Minto may help improve your writing improve by leaps - even when you're good already!
B000002O4S|4.0|This CD consists of music from &quot;Back to the Future.&quot;  It consists primarily of the rock and jazz oriented music used in the movie (even that heard on the homeless man's radio).  The CD also has two tracks of the soundtrack theme.  I would like to have heard more of the score, and also a couple of the popular tunes from the fifties, such as Mr. Sandman and The Ballad of Davy Crockett.  As it is, when the orchestral music comes in on the third track, the change surprises one out of complacency.<br />It has probably the effect that jazz clarinetist Benny Goodman had on the listeners to one of his weekly radio show in 1937, when he invited a string quartet up and played a movement from Mozart's Clarinet Quintet.<br />Earth Angel, the song from the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, also developed an orchestral background near the end.
0679735909|5.0|This is a story about story and those who interpret it.  Byatt has created not only an engrossing novel, but an insightful commentary on literary critique.  Possession is a book of exceptional quality and depth - small wonder it won the Booker prize!  I wondered why I'd never heard of Randolph Henry Ash or Christobel LaMotte before and thought there had been some serious deficiencies in my education until I realized that the two poets were fictional.  The poetry is so well-realized that I would argue that Byatt herself is &quot;the Great Ventriloquist&quot;.  Any student of literature should read this book.  Although it is dense and sometimes difficult, the effort put into reading it will prove worthwhile!
0060090383|4.0|I came upon this book through a coworker and before I even completed the book I knew I'd want to read more of Keyes!  I'm currently in the middle of &quot;Lucy Sullivan&quot; with further plans to keep going.  Great read.
B00006GO99|5.0|I won't gush about how it's the best thing since sliced scrapple, but it's pretty stinking good. A well-recorded selection of Monk originals and covers, Charlie Rouse blowing the roof off, and the whole band moving like an elastic waistband make it a very listenable set. It's a happy record, really, unlike many jazz records; this band loves playing this music, and it really shows.  It also features Rouse at the top of his game as Monk's foremost collaborator/interpreter on sax; at times, Rouse and Monk seem almost telephathic. If you haven't heard Monk on record, make no mistake: like all Monk records, this isn't your grandpa's dance music. But it's one of Monk's most accessible sessions in that all the tunes are both inventive and 'right on,' and unlike most other Monk records, it's a happy swinger throughout, or at least as much as that is true of any Monk record. The band takes its chances, but they all seem to pay off. There are no clunkers here. <BR>Jazz nazis (if it takes one to know one, fine; I used to be one) will sneer that it isn't odd or inaccessible enough to be a classic, but that doesn't mean you have to miss this enjoyable record. If Monk's music is a language all its own, then this is one of his better conversations.
B00006AW2G|5.0|I am 14 years old and I hate most music that is being produced right now. I do, however, love classic rock. I listen to Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, The Who and The Stones. This is one of the Stones greatest albums and it is... simply put... amazing.<BR>Who could say that an album with such songs as Gimme Shelter, You Can't Always Get What You Want and Monkey Man is bad?  Here is my song by song review:<br />1) Gimme Shelter 5/5- One of the Stones best songs; the modd is just fantastic<BR>2) Love in Vain 5/5- A great bluesy ballad that really shows off Mick's vocals <BR>3) Country Honk 4/5- The weakest song but still good; for those who don't know it is a country version of Honky Tonk Woman<BR>4) Live With Me 5/5- Sort of funky with a great chorus <BR>5) Let It Bleed 5/5- One of the best songs on the album; really fun and interesting<BR>6) Midnight Rambler 5/5- A GREAT song that slows down in the middle and turns into a jam (here the version on Get Your Ya-Yas Out!)<BR>7) You Got the Silver 5/5- My second favorite song sung by Keith (after, of course, Happy)<BR>8) Monkey Man 5/5- An amazing song; if you need a reason to get this album... this is it<BR>9) You Can't Always Get What You Want 5/5- Great words, nice chorus and an excellent finish to this album...
B000002JSN|5.0|In 1975 Led Zeppelin released their finest work(yes it is better than Led Zep 4)It is also undoubtedly the greatest heavy rock album of all time. Unsurpassed some 28 years after its release it is rock and roll at it's finest. With Page again producing(from his knowledge as a session musician), they had 8 songs for the new album, just a bit long for a single album. So they decided to go through the vast work they had left over from previous albums and had another 8 songs. These 15 songs would be released in 1975 to unprecedented critical praise and commercial success (a New York store said they were shifting 500 copies an hour!)<BR>  The album highlights are the bluesy In My Time Of Dying, the epic In The Light, and without a doubt the greatest song ever recorded, the immense Kashmir. Any rock fan or of music in general haven't lived until they've heard this album.
B000066F6H|4.0|On overall strong album; from the Buckcherry-esque vocals on &quot;Hate To Say I Told You So&quot; to the other hit single &quot;Main Offender&quot; this album is strong.  The rest of the songs could also be played on radio, but it just is lacking those intangables.  The Hives cockiness is aparent in their performances, and can be backed-up for the most part on this album.
B000002JS6|5.0|When ac/dc released the Back In Black album in 1980 they were finally given the success they had been looking for for seven years. how did it happen? Only that their original singer died by choking on his own vomit. The band decided to continue after the tragedy, and found a new vocalist in Brian Johnson. A guy whose voice sounded like he'd swallowed a knife and it was permanently jammed. But he gave something to the band, a certain edge, that Bon Scott didn't have. This band isn't about the singer anyway. It was always about the guitarist. Angus Young, a 5ft 2in tea drinking man who was born in Glasgow , Scotland, but had spent most of his life in Australia. <BR>  Anyway onto the record at hand. It starts with the greatest opening track of all time, Hell's Bells (a tribute to Bon Scott) and ends with Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution. But in between you have classics such as Shoot To Thrill, What Do You Do For Money, Honey?, and the classic title track.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|I suspect that EMMA is more a must for Gwyneth Paltrow fans than devotees of Jane Austen. I understand from one of the latter that this film isn't faithful to the original book. No matter - GP is the reason to see it.<br />Paltrow plays Emma Woodhouse, who lives with her father at Hartfield, an example of the country manor house obligatory to Austen storylines. Having just been instrumental in getting her governess married off to a rich neighbor, the 21- year old Emma decides to take up match making as a career. After all, it's Regency England and there's not much for a genteel single lady to do with her time. Toiling at the local McFish and Chips to build up the college fund isn't an option. Anyway, most needful of assistance is best friend Harriet Smith (Toni Collette), a respectable enough girl of dubious lineage for whom Emma has plans. Perhaps she can maneuver Harriet into marrying the vicar, Reverend Elton (Alan Cumming), rather than the local farmer whom she loves. Meddling in affairs of the heart is a sticky wicket, but someone has to do it, especially in the absence of a licensed yenta.<br />And what of Emma's own romantic prospects? There appear to be none. True, Hatfield hosts the frequent visits of the 30-something Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam), a well-mannered and well-heeled bachelor from down the carriage road. But he's Emma's brother-in-law, a long standing relationship that seems to preclude anything steamier. However, in one of the film's best scenes early on as Emma and Knightley practice their archery, the two begin bickering over the former's lack of good sense in her handling of the Smith affair. Emma becomes so agitated that she misses the target so widely as to cause Knightley to dryly remark, \\"Try not to kill my dogs.\\" Why, at this point, they seem perfect for each other. One might have thought they were already married.<br />I know this may be hard to believe, but EMMA has less substance than those other fine film adaptations of Austen novels: PRIDE & PREJUDICE (1996), SENSE & SENSIBILITY (1995), and MANSFIELD PARK (1999). Perhaps it's because the heroines of these other romantic comedies, Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle), Elinor Dashwood (Emma Thompson), and Fannie Price (Frances O'Connor) respectively, demonstrate characters of greater pluck, which win the viewer's greater admiration. EMMA's Emma seems flighty and shallow in comparison, and the beguiling Ms. Paltrow plays her to perfection. Northam is superb as Knightley, a gentleman so gentlemanly as to be almost boring. (C'mon, ladies, admit it. Wouldn't a touch of the scoundrel or rake make for a more appealing Mr. Right?)<br />Any of the Austen screen adaptations will never replace a good Sean Connery or Clint Eastwood flick. But all, including EMMA, are light and entertaining. And for a guy like me, watching them leaves female acquaintances believing that I'm truly a Sensitive New Age Fella.vels: PRIDE & PREJUDICE (1996), SENSE & SENSIBILITY (1995), and MANSFIELD PARK (1999).

B000002KDO|5.0|Black Sabbath made two great albums in 1970, but it was on their third release they really hit their stride. Released just 9 months after Paranoid (which was probably regarded as a long time back in 71) this was the album where the group started to gel as a unit. From the opening Sweet Leaf(an ode to marajuana) to the sludgy glory of Into the Void this is without a doubt their finest hour (with Vol.4 a close second) Any heavy metal fan or heavy rock fan hasn't lived until they've heard this album. I'm only fifteen and it's in my top five favorite albums of all time!
B000001FA4|3.0|I have never been really sure what I think of this album. In some ways, it is a standout moment for the band -- it features their first mega-hit classic, Pride (in the name of love). It also features great production. The album also frames and cements the band's political/religious musings in a way that would define them and their image for atleast the next several years.<BR>But on the flipside, it sounds uneven, unfinished, and ultimately unsatisfying. Yes, Bad, Wire, Pride (in the name of love), and A Sort Of Homecoming are great songs. But Promenade is average at best, and the title track sounds more like an attempt at writing an 80's hit and doesn't really fit in with the other tracks. MLK ends the album on a relaxing, pensive note, but in the end, The Unforgettable Fire leaves you wanting more. It is certainly a good album. But I think this was the band planting seeds for bigger and better things. This was the big inhale before the giant exhale of The Joshua Tree.<BR>So if you are a fan, you will like it. If not, buy their Greatest Hits if you want Pride (in the name of love).
B000002KHH|4.0|This is an excellent album, but it is most certainly not their best. If you're looking for the classic Sabbath album I recommend Master of Reality. Don't get me wrong, the first side is classic Sabbath but the second side is a bit patchy. If you Don't own this album I would still highly recommend it, but you should get MOR or Vol.4.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Great story of a young boy's struggle to break free from his harsh environment through dance. Breathtaking acting and dancing by Jamie Bell. I hope we will see more of him. A very moving and touching film. I have not seen a good film as this one for decades. Absolute top!!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Ok, so i just want to say that Room For Squares is the best CD I've ever bought.  I got it last March after seeing John on TV and have rarely taken it out of my CD player.  The different songs all culminate into a beautiful listening experience.  I would recommend this to someone who likes Dave, but isn't a fanatic.  Sure John could be compared to him, but DMB and John are in categories of their own and should never be placed in the same arena.  John's guitar is one of the best I've ever heard.  If you're into guys who play accustic guitar and are good at it, definitely buy this album.  If you enjoy John you might also like Guster and Jason Mraz.  These are some of my other favorites that are awesome with their lyrics and music!!
B00004YYDI|5.0|I bought this movie about a week ago, although I had never seen it before. After I watched it with a friend, I just sat there and said to myself, \\"wow\\". THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN! Jean Reno is absolutely fantastic and Nathalie Portman is unbelievably mature for her age. Leon is so gripping, so fascinating, so cleverly made that I'm surprised it hasn't gained more publicity than it already has. Please watch this. It will change your life!
0312305060|5.0|I loved the book and the movie, a great job in linking these three lives together even though what they shared was depressing (suicide) the dialog is rich and enjoyable.
0930289528|5.0|For real.  This comic is better than Watchmen.  And that's saying a heck of a lot.  This is what started my love affair with Alan Moore's writing.  The fact that you're reading this review trying to decide to buy it is suspect.  Have you ever read Moore??? Of course anything he did for Image doesn't count as he even admitted that was all ....  So stop reading and buy the book, it's a piece of graphic novel history.<br />Seriously.
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt has written an immigrant's tale for the new generation.  American by birth, moved back to Ireland when he was a small boy.  This is his story from when he was young until he moves back to America in his twenties.  This autobiography is both hysterically funny with tales of his communion to crushingly sad with the death of siblings due to poor health and poverty.  McCourt writes about his father and the problems he has with alcohol.  He also writes about his unloving aunt who also buys his first true suit for work.  For me, the most poingment moment of the book is when he comes home drunk the first time and his mother has to deal with him.  This book is a true triumph because even with crushing poverty, McCourt writes about good times and friends growing up.  This book is well worth the time and once you start, you can't put it down again.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This film is by far the best movie I have seen in years. Though hollywood is in the middle of a slump, I was greatly relieved by this intriguing, well-written masterpiece. It is full of great acting, clever ideas, and good screenplay. In fact, the ideas and concepts involved in the film left me shaking at the end. This is \\"some deep shi*\\" as my friend put it. The only reason I am dissipointed is because I never got to see it in theaters. I'm sure that would have added to the already great, eerie atmosphere. So if your in the mood to be chilled and intrigued, get this movie.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I would like to state that \\"Thriller\\" is my favorite CD of All Time.  It is the only CD that I own and will play from the first track to the last and NEVER GET TIRED OF IT!

I am beyond satisfied with the purchase, it was worth the money.
B00003CXXM|3.0|For those of you who loved Robert Ludlums book, the Bourne Identity, I do not recommend this movie. I loved the book so much I bought the movie based on my liking for the book and other reviews I had heard. I was extremely dissapointed. This movie is so horrendously different from the book they should have called it some other title and in captions said, \\"Based on Robert Ludlum's THE BOURNE IDENTITY. <br />I was so disapointed in the outcome of this movie. For those who read the book you will surely remember Carlos, Virilis (the French guy whose wife works for Carlos), the clothes store, and the church where Carlos relays information. None of these are in the movie. In fact I counted about similarities, the names of the main characters, Treadstone 71, that Bourne was a weapon, and that he was shot in a yacht in the beginning, and the bank in Zurich where Bourne gets a lot of money. That's pathetic.<br />For those of you who wonder why I give this 3 stars, it is a great action movie, with some cool stuff, like the car chase and the scaling of the wall. If you were a fan of the book, I wouldn't waste your money unless you rent the movie first.
B00005YW4H|4.0|No offense to people who enjoy slow music, but I really wanted Norah to be more exciting. I mean I do not expect heavy rock here, but I expected more variety. Most of the songs sound the same. I wish more of these songs sounds like &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; but it isn't. This isn't a huge disappointment, but somewhat dull and laid back. Eitherway hope she sweeps the Grammies!
B0000009S3|4.0|When I first listened to the CD when it was released in 1987 I was astonished by the clear sound and the extra material and new mix. I compared to a german pressed LP. But then I bought a LP pressed in US and I was surprised how good it sounded. The sound of the drums makes the biggest difference. THAT version of Hot Rats does deserve the 5 stars! The CD includes some extra minutes of music but I prefer the 1969 edition. Less is more. And a remix seldom makes a record better. Why didn't FZ re-record the whole thing then if he wanted to reach the standards of today?
B0000640VN|4.0|Meg Ryan is as always brilliant in this movie.  It is one of those lighthearted, romantic feel good type movies that you could enjoy on a lazy day.  Don't expect much depth but enjoy it for it's entertainment value.
B000053GTK|5.0|This is probably the best album by Gentle Giant.  Even though the band has said that they didn't like it, you'd never know by the fascinating music acrobatics and suberb songwriting.  And though they had just lost a significant member of the band - saxophonist/singer Phil Shulman - they certainly make up for his absense.  For example, Derek Shulman takes over in the saxophone department. There is a great variety of songs, from the quiet An Inmate's Lullaby, to the hyper Way of Life.<br />This is truely a progressive rock masterpiece!<br />JR
6305784116|2.0|Take Phil Harris as Baloo the Bear, make him a cat, and have him rescue beloved pets from a criminal who intends to do them harm. Replace Louis Prima with Scatman Crothers to provide a jumping musical interlude in the middle of the film. If you can stand watching a mediocre hybrid of 101 DALMATIANS and JUNGLE BOOK, you might consider buying this movie. Your viewing time (and your kids' time, too) would be better spent with other films.
0380789035|4.0|First: this is the first Neil Gaiman book I have read. I'm not a big reader of science fiction, but I had heard good things about his writing and the premise of the book was intriguing.<br />Just released from prison, Shadow learns that his wife Laura has died, and takes up with Loki, somewhat against his will. Shadow is a bit of an enigma and his backstory-- how he came to be in prison, details of his love for his wife-- are revealed slowly and heartachingly. He is much smarter than he seems at first.<br />He gets drawn into Wednesday's battle with Odin, who is in fact an ancient, a battle that will restore the gods to their proper place in society. Many of the gods are rather down-at-heel-- and some of them seem to be new ones-- Media-- a weird incident with the Dick Van Dyke show where Shadow sees Dick beating his wife. And Shadow's wife Laura does not stay in the grave, but hangs around, decomposing, to help him.<br />None of this is fully explained, which is beautiful. Gaiman assumes a very intelligent reader, which I appreciated. He convinces us that he (Gaiman) knows his mythology inside and out, and the power and terror of some of it sticks with me even now.<br />As a whole the book was intelligent, unpredictable, interesting-- and tragic. I withhold one star only because the book was very much a downer-- and maybe that's not fair. It's almost a new genre, a \\"noir fantasy.\\" Really a great read, and unforgettable, nightmare imagery.
B00006YXEK|5.0|It has been difficult to rate this! If you just listen to the music, there is not too much here, unfortunately. I think \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\" is as pretty a song as the early 70s music that so many are familar with like \\"Give Me Love\\" or \\"My Sweet Lord.\\" I also found the song before it, \\"Marwa Blues\\" quite beautiful and moving. While there are other nice songs, particularly \\"Any Road\\" and \\"Between The Devil and The Deep Blue Sea,\\" the CD doesn't offer too much as a whole. The strange packaging with crash dummies only distracts from the music.<br />The DVD, however, shows something completely different! It is short, sadly, but the seven minutes are so dear and worth watching over and over again. George's son not only looks like his father, he has the same sort of personality. This is the best tribute to George I have seen because it gives a glimpse into what the real person was like, NOT just another \\"magazine story.\\" The DVD gives this five stars!
0440219078|5.0|I bought this book after hearing the author interviewed on NPR.  I think I had read some of her books as a girl.  And every now and then I will read a YA novel.<br />I read it in one afternoon-- I'd have gotten through it sooner, but had to look up and around the room and cry from time to time.   I'll never see the color red in the same way again-- now it's something precious, a gift.<br />This book is far more than a dystopia for kids, or a simple allegory.  Some of the ideas in the book-- the notion of group memory, the questioning of the \\"greater good\\"-- are very sophisticated and presented with great subtlety and art.  But the power of the book lies in its story.  The book takes us on a journey through a world that seems idyllic at first, and it is only gradually, and terribly, that we, with the main character, discover the sadness, the real horror, at the heart of the society.  And perhaps the true horror is that the awfulness is not even understood by the people.  There is no malice in this world.  There is just absence-- absence of memory, absence of attachment, absence of all the complicated feelings that can lead us to love and grace.<br />As he accepts the responsibility to become the receptacle of society's memories, the main character learns how his society really works-- how it eschews, even destroys, those who don't contribute, how it abhors individuality, how it ultimately rejects the idea of love.  And he begins to see in color.<br />This is all discovered through the eyes of a child, and told very simply.  The final escape is much debated-- did he die, or find a better place?  I firmly believe that he found a better place, but in the end it doesn't matter.  What does matter is that once again a human being has discovered what it means to be human.<br />This book truly deserves its awards and should be read not just by teachers and students, but by anybody who enjoys a good story.  Thornton Wilder has the Narrator say in his wonderful play OUR TOWN,to Emily's question, \\"does anybody realize life while they're living it, every, every minute?\\"  \\"Poets and artists, they do some.\\"  After reading THE GIVER, you'll be inspired to remember to do that too.  Life is precious, and its memories, even its painful ones, are an incredible gift.
B00005JLF5|1.0|This is the worst series ever because:<br />first: it is a copy of Babylon 5 original idea;<BR>second: it goes against the principles of Gene Roddenberry;<BR>third: it was created by Rick(the StarTrek killer)Berman;<BR>fourth: the plots are boring and tedious;<BR>fifth: it made the klingons a foolish race in the fourth season;<BR>sixth: there is not a single caracter which is interesting;<BR>seventh: they never knew what to do with the caracters, for instance - Gul Dukat was bad at first then became a good friend<BR>but in the end he was bad again;<BR>eighth: every single thing that happened in Babylon 5 in some way<BR>happened on the next season of DeepSpace 9, even the death of Captain Sisco was similar to Sheridan´s death, and the death of Dax happened because of the death of Ivanova;<BR>nineth: the Dominion war took a long time to happen and ended very quickly;<BR>tenth: it is so bad that it is impossible to even think in making a movie out of this series.
B00005YW4H|4.0|So what if she's &quot;hot&quot;... so what if she's Ravi Shankar's girl....<br />Norah Jones is a talent to be reckoned with, and her debut release is worth the praise it has received. Her sultry and hypnotic voice lends itself nicely to some very moody, bluesy tunes. I'm listening right now - for the first time - and I can tell this one's a keeper.<br />Don't be fooled by the nay-sayers. Check it out. You won't be let down.
B00006LLJ4|1.0|Instead of waste my time and money I'd better watch once again &quot;12 monkeys&quot;, &quot;Bladerunner&quot; or any other good old movie.<BR>Personaly, I rate John Woo &quot;Mission Impossible II&quot; 100 times higher than this long-awaiting Spielberg &amp; Cruise movie.<BR>Trailer is a mix of some sci-fiction with silly moralizing, actors are misused absolutely, computer graphics tasteless...<br />Do not recommend to anyone.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I just love and enjoy this CD.  What else can I say?  Great for morning, mid-afternoon, and right before you go to bed!  Why don't you listen to it?
B00005JLSC|4.0|This is a spectacular film adaptation of the famous musical bearing the same name. Among the cast you can see a spectacular cast of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger, bringing before you the show business on stage and in real life. These people, seemingly unrelated in any sense being originally living in three different worlds were brought together by the legal system, which turn out to be a stage for the show business of ruthless lawyers to earn a fortune out of it. The movie weaved all the song and dance numbers tightly together creating a mysterious but fantastic world of Jazz and dance, life and death, glamour and darkness. Catherine Zeta-Jones is stunning as usual as the arrogant stage performer Velma Kelly who despised other people?s as low life sucking up to her. Renee Zellweger as Roxie, who lives between her own fantasy world of stage and struggle in her real life, finally learn the trick of survival in a greater stage performance brought to her by her ruthless and daring lawyer Richard Gere. The performance of the cast is fabulous and the tap dance of Richard Gere should be a part that should not be missed. Renee though portrayed a different person as Roxie, still show glimpses of Bridget Jones from time to time. Nonetheless, the overall performance was not affected by that for both characters lived in dreams from time to time. Singing wise, the standard is average, but the show was supplemented by high quality acting not only from the leads but all from the supporting cast including Queen Latifah as Matron Mama Morton and John C. Reilly as the unfortunate supportive husband of Renee. Chicago is a movie full of actions (in terms of dancing) and entertainment that could get you moving your feet along with it in the theatre.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought this CD a little over a year ago and I'm still loving every track on it.  After listening to it, I can almost gaurantee that you'll have one more reason to love life.  You won't regret getting this!  Some of the best tracks on this album are:<br />No Such Thing<br />Your Body is a Wonderland<br />3x5<br />83<br />And my all time favorite is &quot;St. Patrick's Day.&quot;
0062502182|5.0|A shepherd boy named Santiago traveled to the Pyramids to realize his dream. On the way he faced some obstacles, but he overcame them one after another. It is because he believed in forces within himself. When you finish this story, you will become aware of this force, and you will also begin to understand what prevents you from realizing your dream.<br />This story does not have a conclusion, but each situation is a conclusion. Therefore every time you read it, you will discover something new wisdom. And this book is rare in that it explores a difficult theme using simple and easy to understand language.
B00006LI4S|5.0|This is the absolute best DVD i have ever purchased. Gilmour seems alive and excited in playing. After seeing the Roger Waters DVD, this one puts it to shame.....Gilmour is as great as ever and sounds amazing....highly reccomend and I find my self watching this DVD every day....
B00006CXSS|5.0|I only caught glimpses of this movie when it was actually on HBO, and rare glimpses at that.  I was avoiding it because I thought it be riddled with sappy melodrama and cliche'd characters, pitfalls (to me) of some of Spielberg's movies.  Boy was I wrong.<br />I was browsing through the DVD selections and thought I'd give this one a try, finally: the neat metal case caught my eye and I've a penchant for watching war movies anyway.  The case had Tom Hanks name on it, so I thought maybe there's a chance that Tom held the reins on Spielberg to keep him from going overboard with the drama.<br />I watched it over a period of two days, unable to stop watching on the first day until sleep finally began to overtake me at about 2:00am.  I watched the first 3 DVDs without a stop that day, the next two the following day.  If I could've stayed awake to watch all of them at one sitting I surely would have.  It was that good.  Even though I just finished watching it yesterday, I'm already thinking about watching the whole thing again.<br />What I like about this series would be too long to put into words here.  Just know that it is consistently excellent throughout its 10-hour span.  The acting is top-notch with no overacting or melodrama, the direction keeps everything in line and focused, and even though it's a movie with Spielberg's name on it, special effects are NOT the driving force of this movie.<br />What IS the driving force are the men of Easy Company, the situations they faced, and how they worked as a team to survive and move ahead.<br />Not to be left out of the credits are the brutal battle sequences.  Think of the opening of Saving Private Ryan... times 10, filmed at the same high shutter speed that captures all the detail.  Something that also caught my eye were all the hand signals they used to talk to one another when silence was key.  Incredible.<br />Also, the DVD picture quality itself is superb to say the least.  I have a 73&quot; HDTV and DVDs lacking in quality look terrible on it.  This is not the case with Band of Brothers.  My DVD player said the DVD plays back at a bitrate of about 7-8Mbit/s, twice the 3.5-4Mbit/s of the average DVD.  As a result, mpeg artifacts are seen very, very rarely.
0441172717|5.0|That is how good this book is.  I will forever remember it.  As previous reviewers said, music that I was listening to at the time and things like that, when I hear it again will bring my mind straight back to DUNE.  Dune blends plot, character development, tradegy, and triumph perfectly.  I know no other book(s) that can compare to Dune.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Visually stunning along with some fantastic acting and a great soundtract, this one of favorite fantasy movies of all time. I had the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen 2 yrs ago at a film festival, and the DVD competed with the experience plus it has the advantage of the back ground extras on the movie.<BR>Suggest this to all who remember this movie fondly.
B00004Z4TT|5.0|1999 was a very good year for films indeed, with Fight Club, Memento, Boys Don't Cry, Magnolia and Being John Malkovich all being released in the space of a year.  Being John Malkovich is probably the most promising debut of any director that I've ever seen, ranking right alongside last year's Lantana.  Directed by Spike Lee, formally known for making pop videos, this is as surprising as it is astonishing.  Telling the story of Cusack's disillusioned puppeteer who whilst working on the 7th and a half floor of an office building discovers a way into John Malkovich's mind, this is brilliant filmmaking from start to finish.  As the movie progresses Cusack's character falls in love with the seductive Keener.  It's just unfortunate that his animal-obsessed wife (Diaz in a completely unforgettable role, not just for her acting ability but for the fact that she manages to look dowdy) becomes obsessed with being John Malkovich and that Keener is in love with her inside of Malkovich.<br />It would be completely impossible to pigeon-hole this into any one genre.  Suffice to say that its a twisted love story fantasy science-fiction dramatic comedy.  What makes the movie though, as well as its sheer and consistent originality, is its performances.  Cusack and Diaz for once are playing the losers, the dowdy couple who appear doomed to a life of miserable boredom.  Keener as the maneater is also incredibly enjoyable, winning herself a well-deserved Oscar nomination for her multi-faceted performance that could so easily have fallen into parody.  Perhaps what is most delightful though is John Malkovich himself playing along with it all, poking fun at his public persona where nobody can remember any of his films and he's often overly dramatic.  Indeed, the scene where he enters his own mind just to see a nightmarish visual of his head imposed on other people's bodies, each one only able to utter 'Malkovich' can only be described as comic genius.<br />There are countless aspects of this movie that make it enjoyable, although probably the most refreshing aspect of it all is that it was made in the first place.  It would seem that hte public have become tired of blockbusters and are craving for something different.  Being John Malkovich is about as far removed from the typical Hollywood movie as you could possibly imagine and not something you'd perhaps expect to see big name stars in.  The only thing I can think of is that the actors read the magnificent script.  Equal parts nightmare and fantasy, Being John Malkovich is one of the most original Hollywood pictures ever released.  I can't recommend it strongly enough.
6304508611|3.0|Although widely regarded as one of the classic horror films of the 70s CARRIE is one of those movies that has moments you love AND hate for a variety of reasons. The first adaptation of a Stephen King novel, CARRIE is notable for jump starting the careers of many involved.Carrie White is a high school misfit who lives in a rundown house with her fanatically religious mother. <BR>The film opens with Carrie having her first period in the girls shower room. Ignorant because of her mothers religious beliefs, Carrie thinks she is dying, but when she turns to the other girls for help the other girls pelt her with tampons and chant \\"Plug it up!\\". When one of the teachers intervenes to help Carrie the lights in the locker room mysteriously explode.Carrie is sent home to her religious fanatic mother (Piper Laurie, returning to film after a lengthy hiatus) One of the girls who joined in the hazing, Susan Snell (Irving) feels ashamed and asks her boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to take Carrie to the prom as a special favor.  However her nemesis, Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) is not so sympathetic and having been barred from attending the prom, when she hears Carrie is going she gets her boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta) and his friends to kill a pig so they can dump the blood on her at the prom. Amazing that even dimwits like them can see the symbolism in the shower of blood. But come the night of the prom, predictably all hell breaks loose...<BR>For those of you who haven't seen the movie to go any further would be to spoil it, but there have been some changes from King's novel,especially the classic final 20 minutes. The movie is lighter than the book, and De Palma does a good job on a limited budget. But the film is almost embarressingly dated in places (William Katt's hair for starters) and I hope the TV remake airs in NZ. That said, CARRIE remains one of the best  adaptations of Stephen King to film, and is still fun Halloween viewing more than 25 years later.
6305736650|5.0|Welcome to Rick's, the hot spot in Casablanca!  Rick's, run by Richard \\"Rick\\" Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), is where people come from all over Europe in order to escape World War II and the terror of the Nazi's .  Visitors gamble at the roulette table, make fishy deals at their tables, bribe officials at the bar, and toast to future health everywhere.  All of this takes place under the tunes from Sam's (Dooley Wilson) piano while Rick refrains from drinking with customers.  One night Rick is approached by Guillermo Ugarte (Peter Lorre), a regular, who trusts Rick and asks if he can hold some visa papers for him.  This is the beginning of a heart breaking episode for Rick, since he once again has to face a woman who previously broke his heart.  This woman is Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), a woman he meet in Paris before the Nazi's occupied France and who he was supposed to escape with.  However, she ran off at the last minute and he has not seen her since he saw her last in Paris.  Casablanca has a fabulous cast as it is telling a story buried in secrets, spies, murders, and lies.  In the end, Casablanca will provide a suspenseful adventure interlaced with love and greed with honorable and cynical characters.
B00005ATQI|3.0|Stanley Kubrick, Stephen King and Jack Nicholson. It sounds like a dream combination doesn't it? Touted as \\"the first epic horror film\\", THE SHINING is a love it or loathe it affair depending on whether you are a Kubrick fan or a King fan. Which is where I have a problem as I am both.<BR>For those of you who are unfamiliar with the story, it centres around Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a struggling writer and recovering alcoholic who takes over the job of winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel, even after learning that the last caretaker went mad with \\"cabin fever\\" and killed his family. So Jack moves in with his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) who has a psychic ability which allows him to see the future (or his imaginary friend Tony does). Both book and film get these points across. Here Danny befriends an old man named Dick O' Halloran (Scatman Crothers), who also has the same ability as Danny (\\"shining\\"). But soon Danny starts having disturbing visions: the word REDRUM appearing on walls, blood gushing out of the elevator, two identical twin ghosts show him a vision of his butchered body etc.<BR>But none of this is scary at all. Odd, but not scary. In fact the creepiest part of the movie is when Wendy reads Jack's manuscript... The scene featuring Nicholson and the dead woman in the bathtub is suitably gross, but not scary. <BR>Personally though I feel that the movie is mostly a huge disappointment, Kubrick has virtually  completely restructured King's masterpiece and concentrated more on the character of Jack Torrance than on giving the viewer explainations as to why he is going mad. That isn't what mainly bothers me, as I love the psychological stuff; but the fact that Kubrick tried making a horror film without knowing anything about them. Viewers were also expecting great things after the disappointment of BARRY LYNDON. I have mixed feelings about the movie. The casting was pretty bad too: Nicholson, though a terrific actor neverreally grows into the role and Shelly Duvall is just awful. Danny Lloyd is pretty bad too, it's hard not to burst out laughing when you see him talking to his pinky, it's not creepy; it's just plain ridiculous. However, the climactic scene in the snow covered maze is beautifully photographed but in this case I thini you're better off re-reading the book.
B00000IBRI|2.0|There are mysterious disappearances of young girls in the Swiss Alps and the police have recovered a victim's head covered with maggots.  When the young Jennifer Corvino (Jennifer Connelly) arrives to the Richard Wagner Boarding School for girls, she seems to have problems adjusting and she also has a problem with sleepwalking.  One night when she has woken up from her sleepwalking, she is brought to Professor John McGregor's residence by his assistant.  She finds out that Professor McGregor is an entomologist and she has an ability to communicate with insects.  Together, these two skills seem to be very helpful in the search for the killer of young girls.  Phenomena is a film that looses its audience due to its weak story, but might keep some folks attention with its gruesome and creepy effects.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Monsters Inc. is a wonderful movie, it's cute, it's funny, the cast is lovable..Did I mention it's a funny movie? Aha, thought so. I could sit and watch Monsters Inc. and Lilo and Stitch all day. Pass the popcorn, please.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Sure the movie loses a little of its magic on the small screen, but the Spider-Man DVD makes up for that in spades.  The movie itself is a whole lot of fun and the tons of special features just make it better.  One thing:  as much as i love Tobey Maguire, it was kind of creepy watching his shirtless screen test.
6302662648|5.0|This movie is really entertaining, keeps you on edge and is fun to watch. I've seen it atleast 20 times, and love it the same as I had the first time. In a world where are a lot of movies arent worth the time and money, Sneakers is guaranteed NOT to be one of those.
0066214122|4.0|Once again, Michael Crichton, the master of \\"Techno thrillers\\", has done it again. I could not put the book down. It was wonderful. I had heard a rumor in the book store that it was not very good, and was thinking of passing it by. Im glad that I didnt. The book kept me on my feet until the last pages, and thats what Crichton is best at. <br />\\"Prey\\" is another one of Crichton's novels that is based on bacteria sized particles, as was in \\"The Andromeda Strain\\".  This time we are faced with Nanoparticles, that are being tested to help look inside a medical patients body by forming a camera when coming together.  But what happens when the particles escape and begin to evolve and think on their own?<br />This novel is just plain chilling.  The research behind this book is wonderful, and well done, as Crichton always manages to do.  And that is what makes this so chilling.  It makes you wonder what would happen if the events of this novel really took place.  I think you will be pleased with the results of this fast paced, chilling novel.
B00005JL95|5.0|GREAT! Definatly the best movie DISNEY has put out in the last few years. The cast is extremely lovable, and this movie is definatly hilarious. Don't rent it, buy it. You will loooooove it, I can't see anyone not loving this movie..
B00005JLSC|5.0|This film successfully transitions Bob Fosse's smash musical (currently in revival on Broadway) to the screen. Director Rob Marshall imaginatively uses the film techniques at his disposal to keep the audience engaged thru the fast pace and switches between reality and Roxie's fantasies. The story is set in the dance halls and theaters of the Roaring Twenties, and involves love, murder and an examination of the difference between notoriety and fame and the fleeting nature of success.<br />Roxie Hart (Renee Zellewegger) is a girl who dreams of being a musical star, as is her role model Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones). They soon both are in jail awaiting trial for murders that they have committed, and vie for the attention of attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), the hot shot lawyer who has never lost a capital case. They also attempt to capture the media spotlight, given the headline-grabbing nature of their crimes of passion, Velma's fame, and the press sensationalism of the time. While Zeta-Jones was already an accomplished dancer, all the performanes are excellent, and it is a tribute to Zellwegger and Gere that while perhaps not up to the quality of Broadway stage performers they handle the musical and dancing aspects of their roles so well. (Richard Gere engaged in a huge amount of practice for the tapdancing scene alone.) Queen Latifah utilizes her talents to the fullest and is wonderful as the manipulative prison matron. John C. Reilly does a superb job as Amos, Roxie's faithful and loving husband who is not the brightest star in the sky. (His musical routine as \\"the Cellophane Man\\" is captivating.)<br />But remember that this is a big stage musical on the screen, not a complicated plot or a moving and emotional drama. The story is only a vehicle for the incredible music and the marvelous dance routines of Bob Fosse, and totally succeeds in that attempt. So go to enjoy an hour and forty-five minutes of action and fun and to see the wonderful performances of the cast. (And at a small fraction of the price that you would pay for tickets to the Broadway show.) Hopefully, the artistic and commercial success of CHICAGO will cause other producers, directors and actors to realize the potential of current Broadway shows to become hit films and encourage them to revive this almost forgotten form of movie release.
0385484518|5.0|Well- I would just like to say that when you are reading this book you really fall in love with Morrie, and I fell in love with Mitch too and his honesty and how he changed in those short Tuesdays. A great book to read, not very long so it's very manageable to sneak a few pages here and there in..
0151006903|4.0|A necessary disclaimer in reviewing any translated book is that it is a depreciated version of the original, though the best we've got.  Every translation also gives off an unintended impression that the original text does not to a native speaker.  In this instance, it seemed that in this simplified tone and jumpy pace this book could easily qualify as fantasy or an adventure novel for teenagers.<br />Obviously, there is much more to it than that (themes often lose the punctuation they receive from the lyricism of original language).  Eco tackles the Middle Ages with the aplomb of a diligent historian.  It is easy to tell how much the author loves his subject in his detailed though fortunately not harping narrative jaunts into the Crusades, the ignorant barbarism of the Crusaders, the politics of church and state before the two were separated, the romantic celebrity of civil nobility in a stifling caste system, the schism between the Christian East and West, dreams of discovery in a time when the world seemed flat and less finite - full of wonder, relics, and scientific curiosity.<br />We follow the unlikely adventures of Baudolino, son of a simple Italian farmer who is adopted by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and given unimaginable opportunities, setting on a lifelong dream quest of exploration, adventure, and transient romance.  The story is told by Niketas, a Greek nobleman listening to Baudolino's story, as Eco does not forget to kindle the issue of narrational trust.  Here this is especially crucial as we are reading autobiographically-skewed history.  If history is written by the victors, Baudolino proves it can also written by imaginative farmers given the right opportunity and disciples.

0060977493|3.0|The latent talent is there, but this author needs to refine her overblown, self-indulgent, and often self-consciously showy prose. If she can learn to tone it down, she may be on to something . . .
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I rented this movie when it first came out to see what all the hype was about.... I thought for sure I was going to turn it off within the first half hour, but instead I went right out and bought it! What an amazing film!<br />This was, by far, one of the best films of 2001!<br />A great cast, GREAT songs, amazing cinemotgraphy, a great story line, and best of all THEY ALL ACTUALLY SING!!!! No milli-vanilli bull here!<br />Get it!  It's a great addition to your dvd collection and never gets old no matter how many times you watch it!
B00006AL1G|4.0|Well made... Very well made. This package is so well put together its almost too exhaustive (as if!). The main feature is superb, candidly portraying turntablists in a human light, letting them describe their obsessions with the beats and breaks in their own time. Oh the beats! As the quirky visual editing keeps pleasing the viewer so to does the soundtrack constantly throughout both dvds.<BR>The other stuff includes wicked &quot;tutorials&quot;, extra raw interviews, some of the finest looking menu's I've seen fow a while and even a sticker!<BR>I wholeheartedly recommend esp if (like me) you loved other contemporary documentaries ie Beyond the Mat (wrestling) and Dogtown and Z-boys (skating).
B00005JLKB|5.0|I have seen every Superman Movie atleast 20 times and watched Louis and Clark faithfully.  Smallville started out with something to prove, it has done just that. From the music to the stories and cast, the creators have really put together an incomparible show.  I don't know if Remy Zero wrote \\"Save Me\\" for the show, but they sure have a great sound. That track is perfect for the opening of the show. I record every show and watch them often, although I do wish the DVD of Season 1 were readily available.  I am guessing it will be in High Definition... looking forward to the release.
B00005ATQI|2.0|It's a pretty good measure of the boredom and disengagement that befuddled the last half of Stanley Kubrick's career that he would stoop to filming a ghost story.  Having disposed of  topics like nuclear war and the fate of the human race in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;2001,&quot; it must have been well-nigh impossible to come up with a story that satisfied his appetite for big projects.  &quot;The Shining&quot; dodges Stephen King's usual imbecilities as long as it can, holding out the hope that the title character is just going mad and isn't being plagued by ghosts.  But eventually Kubrick gives in and turns loose the spooks.  With or without them the whole thing is way too slow.  Kubrick must have sensed how bad it all was: he reportedly lost his temper repeatedly with Shelly Duvall's awful performance, and the kid is terrible, too.
B0000797IO|2.0|A lurking cynicism behind the portrayals of these characters, trapped as they are by their droll and inane lives, almost manifests itself here as comedy. The dubious choices these unsypathetic characters make in their lives result in very little emotional engagement for the audience. Mainly, I was wondering how this movie was made in the first place and why otherwise talented people would dedicate their time to completing it. There are only two good points (one for each star): 1) Aniston shows more of an acting range than expected in her portrayal, and 2) the characters and their situations are all but guaranteed to make everyone else feel better about their own lives, by comparison. I would only recommend this to a friend going through a serious funk in order to show them that as bad as their job, marriage, abuse problems, affairs, etc. might be...
B000075BFK|4.0|Tupac is the one diamond in the rough I can still listen to. I rarely listen to the radio in fear of going deaf from hearing the non-talented artist like ja rule, jay-z, and ashanti, so the only option I have is CD's. When I bought Better Dayz I was kind of pessimistic and did not know what to expect. After a couple of listens, I have no complaints besides too many of artist featured. And yes as you know, Tupacs lyrics are six years outdated because he takes shots at Delores Tucker, Bill Clinton, Biggie and of course Gay...I mean Jay-Z. But the sad part is Tupac has been dead(or supposedly) for six years and nobody still cant get on his level. Jay-Z tried re-create tupacs version of \\"Bonnie & Clyde\\", but he severely cheapened the value of Tupacs classic he worked so hard on. Even that blow is not enough to take out Tupacs legacy. \\"Better Dayz\\" is unfortunately the last album from Tupac in his Makeveli period, so this might be the last time we hear his voice, but then again like he says on the last of his CD \\"Expect me, like you expect Jesus to come back. Im comin'\\"
6301966015|5.0|Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film is his best.  The images of 60's mod London are wonderful.  The camera's eye during the park scene and nat sound is some of the best filmmaking ever.  This is a beautiful film.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I have to admit that at first I didnt want to listen to John Mayer because all I could see was a Dave Matthews [knock]-off.  But when a friend of mine gave me a copy of this album and I listened as a courtesy.. and I found myself liking it more and more and got to where it was all I would listen to.  To compare John Mayer to Dave Matthews is an unfair.  The only serious comparison to make is that they both play guitar and both write songs about women.  John has his own style and he is worth listening to.
B00005PJ6M|5.0|Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is excellent! This movie released in July 1991 was the sequel to first Bill and Ted movie! Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves play Bill and Ted. George Carlin is Rufus! They go threw a most triumphant Journey from Hell to Heaven and to the Battle of the Bands. I recommended this movie so much! Buy it! Highly Recommended! this is a most excellent movie not to be missed.
0345440900|2.0|Before the birth of our son, my husband and I read The Baby Wisperer carefully took notes, and were prepared to follow her instructions for an &quot;independent&quot; baby.  When our boy was born, however, we had a revelation.   Babies become independent by being held constantly, sleeping with their parents, fed when hungry, and held and comforted when they cry.  Hogg advises you to &quot;train&quot; your baby to sleep on its own and to get on a schedule.  There is proof that babies who are not held or who do not sleep with their parents have higher levels of stress in their bodies than babies raised in the ways of &quot;traditional cultures&quot;.  After three months of constantly holding (carrying in baby slings), sleeping with and always being there for our child, he rarely cries.  We can read his needs before he has to resort to tears.  He's a cheerful and content boy, who came into this world crying about everything.  He no longer has to cry to be happy and we find we can get so much accomplished during the day because he is so content.  A few months of intense baby-holding is paying off and will continue to pay off greatly as our baby grows.  Please read books by Dr. Sears and his wife for more information on raising physically and emotionally healthy children.  Hogg did give great advice on breastfeeding and how to read your baby's moods and needs. Her book is valuable for these chapters.  Overall, however, you can get much better advice from Dr. Sears.
0920668372|1.0|This is the most disturbing childrens book I have ever read. The mother climbs in the grown sons window? Psycho mother. The pictures are just as disturbing as the story. I understand the concept of role reversal, but this story and the pictures that go along with it seem a little exaggerated. I would NOT show this to my child.
B000002J03|5.0|Every home should have a copy of this album.<br />Less bluesy than their first album, but with the roots still clear, the band really comes into their own with this album and sets the stage for rock and roll for years to follow.  It's all there - the power and energy of the songs, excellent musicianship, and the recording/mastering techniques put such a shine on the solid platinum album that I gotsta have my shades on when I takes it off the shelf.<br />When I saw that someone made the ridiculous comment that the bass line from Ramble On \\"was stolen from \\"It's All Right (The Way That You Live)\\" by The Velvet Underground\\", I could only laugh because first of all Velvet Underground did not even write that song - it is a 'The Letter's' cover.  Second, Zeppelin does steal riffs and songs - because that's rock and roll!  It's called 'roots'.  'The Lemon Song' is Zeppelin's version of 'Killing Floor', Bring it On Home, Living Loving Maid, Whole Lotta Love, etc. - but try to tell they're the same songs.  You can't, because they're not.  Also if you know a little bit about Page's history, you know that he did session work for years, and it wouldn't be at all surprising to me if he actually played with Velvet Underground in the studio, maybe even on the song 'It's Alright' (I'm not saying he did, but it wouldn't surprise me...).<br />If you're thinking about this album, get it.  If you're thinking about trying out Led Zeppelin, I recommend this one over all of their other non-greatest-hits albums.
B000070WJE|5.0|This is definitely Robbie's best album  and the best album i've ever heard.  The best song is Come undone its fantastic.  Don't waste time reading these stupid reviews just buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005YJMX|5.0|I have seen both versions of Nosferatu (1922, 1979) and i would recommend them both. The 1922 version is a classic but this remake has done a great job of using its era's advantages to make it great like sound, color and more places to film etc. I especially like the end of this movie when Johnothan rides away on the horse across the beach of sand while the opera song plays. This was not even attempted in the original and the idea of having the vampire survive is a great idea. I loved that opera song at the end and would watch this movie anytime. I would suggest getting it on DVD though.
B000002B2T|5.0|I heard a song on the radio which was \\"river of deceit\\" and did'nt know it then and the song was like one of the most beutiful songs ive heard.I finally caught the tv playing a song of theres \\"river of deceit\\" which sounded like the song I heard on the radio by mad season and thought I need to get that cd.I thought they were a new band out or something cause ive never heard of them and went and bought there cd and it's a old cd.Which I figured out layne staley does the vocals on this cd which I love his voice and own some alice n chains cd's as well.<br />I thought \\"river of deceit\\" was gonna be the only good song on the cd but its not.Theres \\"I'm above\\" \\"I don't know anything\\" \\"lifeless dead\\" \\"artificial red\\" and some more.This cd just kicks ... .I'm glad I got it and found out who this band was cause I love the whole cd and think all the songs are great.I love staley's vocals too.I jam in a band with my uncle and I sing some alice in chains songs and currently learning some mad season songs.This cd just is awesome.Just buy it.You won't regret it.
B000007UFO|5.0|Simple Minds should never be laid to the side without a close listen.  Certainly, not everything they produced was on par with this album and Sparkle in the Rain, but how many albums of this stature have been produced in the history of mankind?  Simple Minds never realized the greatness of Pink Floyd in a monetary sense, but in musical and experimental livelihood and uniqueness, they match perfectly.  This is not to say that Simple Minds is not a journey of its own, only that in stature they deserve a place with greats such as Floyd and Moody Blues.  A sense of owing popularity a bit to U2's own, despite vague similarities to U2's later works such as 'Joshua Tree' and 'Unforgetable Fire' Simple Minds early on surpass them in pure genius.  <BR>Simple Minds is rightfully considered New Wave while on the same hand surpassing easy definition of the genre.  Thought-provoking lyrics substantiated by powerful and experimental music.  The entire album is set with grand schemes which aspires to, and achieves, etherial thought in music.
0380002930|4.0|This book was assigned to me in December, and I couldn't tell you how much I was dreading this book about rabbits.  And I hae to truthfully tell you that the first two chapters tend to drag on andyou will count the mintues that pass. But Parts 3 and 4 make up for it and more.  It is a fantastic book with many new and exciting adventures.  A group of 14 rabbits trying to find a new home overcomming hardships.  If you like Lord of the Rings, try reading the book that started it all.
B000001EHS|4.0|I am a real fan and thought Vault was quite good. The others as well. The earlier stuff I am not that big on. Some was good at the time....but they have changed somewhat with the times. I for one will buy X and others as I collect this type of music. But yes Vault is not a must have by any means. Yes it is missing some essential Def. So ya if you do want all the really good songs. But if you cant afford all the albums...the Vault is at least a somewhat good solution to having some Def Leppard that you want. Otherwise do yourself a favor and just save for the albums separetly and buy them!
B00005JLF5|5.0|Finally, the moment is here. Deep Space Nine is coming to dvd. By far the best Star Trek Series. DS9 proved that there was life beyond the Enterprise. After the first two series focused on ship life and exploring, DS9 introduced new places and aliens. Showed the darker side of Trek and brought many important issues into play.<br />DS9 also had amazing battle scenes, be it space or ground battles. They were much fun to watch. The Dominion war was something to behold. Not to mention the prominence of the Cardassians as bad guys.<br />Best of all for me was the Dominion. Probably the best Star Trek villans created. The Founders, the Vorta, the Breen and the warrior Jem'Hedar made the show exciting. And unlike many Trek villans past, they were around for a long time and not just an episode here and there. <br />A great series and sci-fi magic. I look forward to purchasing it and the rest of the 7 seasons. 6th and 7th were the best.
0385335482|5.0|This book is so funny. I loved this book caues from page one your hook! It's about a lady who can't stop shopping...now all her bills are over there limits and through out the book she tries finding ways to get out of debt.

Which I got for christmas,it's even better.
B00006GO9Q|3.0|The appeal of post-1968 Miles, once on the wane in the wake of Wynton Marsalis' reactionary influence, is making a comeback.  Many younger listeners are fascinated by &quot;analog&quot; electronic instruments and apt to be totally unfamiliar with the harmonies, structure, and melodies of so-called popular &quot;standards.&quot;  Moreover, since &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; was as much a performance of editing (by Miles and Macero) as of music, the album readily connects with the listening habits of the present generation.  My son, for example, can hear any one of several editions of &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; and pronounce judgement on its samplings, loopings, amount of reverb, etc. in comparison to previous morphs of the same album (he tells me this edition is quite acceptable).  As for my own relationship with &quot;In a Silent Way,&quot; it has been an on-again, off-again type of affair that probably should have ended after the first date.  I recall feeling pressured to accept this album and &quot;B's Brew&quot; when they first made their appearance but very quickly jettisoning both albums in favor of the &quot;old&quot; Miles.  At the time I considered the &quot;new&quot; Miles somewhat revolutionary but boring; today, listening to the CD reissues, I find them less revolutionary but no more engaging.<br />&quot;Silent Way&quot; is less abrasive than &quot;Brew&quot;--in fact, it's a rather pleasant, atmospheric album.  But if your attraction to jazz is to the &quot;in the moment,&quot; extemporaneous and daring inventiveness of soloists creating new melodies on familiar forms, these fusion albums are more likely to sound like period pieces than the earlier, &quot;classic&quot; Miles' quintets with, first, Coltrane and, later, Shorter.  In fact, listening to a newly available French release of a transitional Miles quintet with Sonny Stitt on saxophone, I'm amazed at the virtuosity, passion--pyrotechnics even--of Miles' trumpet playing, unassisted by electronic instruments or studio editing and production effects.  The challenges to which he subjected himself in the early '60s may not be viewed as &quot;revolutionary&quot; in terms of the changing styles, instrumentation, or consumer trends following Miles' career.  But in its bold revisioning of an established tradition, the earlier music is certainly more radical.  &quot;In a Silent Way,&quot; on the other hand, is a complete departure from that tradition, looking forward to the accessible musical styles of &quot;smooth jazz.&quot;struments or studio editing and production effects.

0452282152|5.0|Sixteen year old, Griet, becomes the servant at the Vermeers' as her parents need her to earn money seeing her father could no longer work.  Griet's responsibilities are to clean the master's studio.  The novel traces Griet's life at the Vermeer's and how she becomes engrossed in her masters work, leading to the painting of Griet as the girl with the pearl earring.  <br />The novel is loosely based on Vermeer's painting, Girl with a Pearl Earring.  It portrays a picture of Dutch life in the 17th century and what life inside Vermeer's house may have been like.  I have seen many mixed reviews on this novel however, I would certainly recommend it to others who enjoy a fictional story based on a historic periods.
B0000025DR|5.0|1975's \\"Face The Music\\" was ELO's fifth album, and it remains my personal favorite ELO disc to this day. It was the first ELO album I ever bought, and it made me a lifelong fan. I was completely blown away by the album's most famous trio of songs that I kept hearing on the radio: the magnificent orchestral rocker, \\"Fire On High,\\" and the instant pop classics \\"Evil Woman\\" & \\"Strange Magic.\\" And I was equally thrilled by the album's other musical gems, such as \\"Waterfall,\\" \\"Nightrider,\\" \\"Down Home Town,\\" and the dreamy album closer, \\"One Summer Dream.\\" I love the band's Beatle-esque flair for melody, their fine musicianship & production, and the excellent singing, songwriting, and guitar work of leader Jeff Lynne. Great stuff all the way.Capturing the group right smack in the middle of the 70's, \\"Face The Music\\" is the Electric Light Orchestra at their most creative. I enjoy all of the band's albums, including other great works like \\"On The Third Day,\\" \\"Out Of The Blue\\" and \\"Time,\\" but \\"Face The Music\\" is the one that I have the most fondness for. Now, if only those folks at Sony Music would give this album a long-overdue remaster treatment....one can dream. :-)
B000021XS0|5.0|I have owned this album for about 4 months now and each time I listen to it, it seems to get better and better.  It's nice to put in the cd and listen to the amazing talent that Petrucci, Myung, Portnoy, and Rudess possess.  I feel that James Labrie has improved a lot on this album, but I still feel that DT's ultimate progression as a band should be instrumental.  As a classical musician, it's nice to hear amazing displays of technical genius that so many people consider mundane and too much.  I think that one problem of modern day pop music is the focus away from technique and good song writing and a focus on what sells.  It is obvious that Dream Theater has no interest in this.  Of all 7 DT studio albums this is my favorite.
6305252521|3.0|THE TRUMAN SHOW is perhaps one of the most depressing comedies ever made. Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy it and had a few larfs here and there. But the idea of a man spending 30 years of his life in a make-believe world which exists only to entertain television viewers is in itself depressing. Although Truman Burbank (predictably)ends up leaving the TV world and enters the real world at the end (and is presumably happy), the ending is less than inspiring. No amount of triumphant violin music at the end can change the fact that Truman wasted most of his life, if you can call it that. So see this tear-jerker disguised as a heart-warming comedy. But Carrey fans, beware. This is this most understated performances yet. No rubber-face antics here. He almost (gasp) plays it straight. Of course, Ed Harris is great in this one even though he has less than 15 minutes total screen time. Considering how popular this movie is, I'm surprised they haven't made a special edition DVD yet! This is what Bruce Almighty aspired to be. Cerebral yet funny. Touching yet poignant. Let's see a special edition DVD!
B000068PQ0|5.0|yeah, so this is the new lips LP, and if you don't have it already you must be silly, simple, or both.  The hype is true; what your friend told you is true (unless your friend is a total idiot); this album's greatness is true.  if you would be so kind to your ears as to pick this one up and treat them to a musical feast of numbing, sonic, and ultimately beautiful tracks, they will thank you gladly.  buy it...and come to think of it, get your mom one too; she'll love it!

B0000065TL|5.0|There's nothing better in all of Madonna-land than this documentary/concert film.  Some may say the scenes are contrived at times, but I challenge you to find any celebrity (or human being) who wouldn't put on some sort of show when a camera is pointed at them. And by the end of the movie, it is obvious that Madonna is every bit the persona she puts forth. The biggest surprise to many may be the amount of work she truly does to entertain. Her shows and tour are exhausting to watch- I can't imagine the physical demands it must take doing it every night.<br />Also, as a gay man growing up in the midwest, seeing this movie was my first 'exposure' to other gay men. At 12 years of age my only impression of gay men and women were the skewed stories of hatred that poured forth from my church and teachers. Watching Madonna's gay male dancers form a family, love, hate, play, perform and LIVE, I felt less alone. I learned that there was a world beyond my conservative religious home. This movie suddenly opened up a world of possibilities for me. How many other music divas have done that for their fans?  Madonna is in a class all her own, and I owe much of my pride to her and to Truth or Dare!
B00006F83Y|5.0|This must be one of the most eclectic and eccentric rock albums of recent years, at least among anything near the mainstream. No matter how weird you think the hit single \\"No One Knows\\" is, you have to admit that it sticks in your head, and it sure is unique if anything. The same goes for this album, where we find metal, punk, and grunge mixed with other flavors into a monster that only rockers who are versed in mind expansion could come up with. A good indicator of the album's groove is the awesome opener \\"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar...\\" but then the surprises build up, like the boogie-woogie piano in \\"Go With the Flow,\\" some retro 70's California rock in \\"Another Love Song,\\" and duetted lead guitars a la Judas Priest or Iron Maiden in \\"Song for the Deaf.\\" We even get an acoustic ballad with piano and orchestra in \\"Mosquito Song.\\" The man holding everything together among all this weirdness is Dave Grohl, effortlessly proving that he's still a far more powerful drummer than singer/guitarist. The radio DJ snippets are a gimmick that gets old real quick, and some of the grungier tracks like \\"Song for the Dead\\" and \\"God is in the Radio\\" get lost in a maryjane-induced haze. But if you like rock that ignores boundaries while pummeling the less coherent areas of your brain, then Queens of the Stone Age are for you. You gotta admit, it's different.
B000005HO0|4.0|This live album captures the essence of Mayhem's sound at the top of their game, whether in reworked songs from their first three official releases or in the songs that made &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot; great. Vocalist Dead, who shaped many of the concepts and much of the sound of the band, provides a searing, schizophrenic and disassociative performance which suggests all of the necro that black metal once intended. If you like &quot;De Mysteriis&quot; you owe it to yourself to get this also for comparison.
0385335482|5.0|Engaging and witty from beginning to end, &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; had me laughing out loud and cringing in sympathy.  <BR>Rebecca is a delightful and surprisingly complex character, and the first person narrative strengthens the novel.  A thoroughly entertaining character and story make this definitely worth the read - more than once.
B000002MTR|4.0|I remember thinking in 93-94 that Dave Navarro would be a perfect replacement on guitar. And in a way he was. I'm sure it was no different than the feeling fans had when BOTH John and Chad were new to the band on &quot;Mother's Milk&quot;. That was a great record too, just different than before. Isn't it good for an album not to sound like the one before it. Imagine if Beck or U2 made the same album every time. No thanks. &quot;One hot minute&quot; is great. It's got a couple rockers like &quot;Warped&quot; and &quot;One big mob&quot;, funk like &quot;Aeroplane&quot; and &quot;Walkabout&quot;, and ballads like &quot;My friends&quot; and &quot;Tearjerker&quot;. Actually my 3 favorite peppers albums each have a different guitarist. This being my 3rd, &quot;Blood Sugar&quot; my 2nd, and &quot;Uplift Mofo&quot; my 1st. And whether this is your favorite Pepper's album or not, dont forget to check out Jane's Addiction.
B000002UAF|5.0|With their third album, the Beatles made an album whose first seven songs were featured in their first feature film, and their first album where they didn't do any cover songs.  They'd have to do Rubber Soul to make that a regularity.  But what makes this a key album in their career is that it features a consistent overall sound that makes the usual descriptions impossible.<br />From that immortal opening guitar chord, the frantic rhythm and John's double-tracked vocals, making it look like he's doing a duet with himself.  He does get backing vocal help from the others.  Think, the chorus represented the voice of a generation:  \\"It's been a hard's day night, and I've been working like a dog.  it's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log.  but when I get home to you I feel the things I should do, it makes me feel all right.\\"  This song, along with another on this album, is what I'd play in demonstrating the archetypal Beatles sound.<br />John's harmonica opens the lively \\"I Should Have Known Better\\", with great backing from George's guitar.<br />\\"If I Fell\\", sung by John, but with harmonies sung by him and Paul is one of two great ballads here, and showed how they were progressing in comparison to their contemporaries.<br />\\"I'm Happy Just To Dance With Her\\" is George's only lead vocal, and like \\"Do You Want To Know A Secret\\", is a Lennon composition.  With the later albums, George would sing the stuff he wrote.<br />\\"And I Love Her\\", the other sweet romantic ballad, is sung by Paul, with Ringo doing some work on bongos.  This is one of the reasons why I favour Paul's vocal talents over the other three.<br />\\"Tell Me Why\\" is the really racing number the Fabs do at the concert finale in the movie.<br />\\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", sung by Paul, is the other song I'd nominate as having that classic Beatles sound.  No shot in the arm for materialism here:  \\"I don't care too much for money/money can't buy me love\\"<br />The remaining six songs are not featured in the movie.  \\"Any Time At All\\" has John assuring a girl that \\"Anytime at all, all you gotta do is call and I'll be there.\\"<br />\\"I'll Cry Instead\\" has that late 50's sound the Beatles were used to covering in their early days.  I detect a melody similar to the Stones' \\"19th Nervous Breakdown\\" in some parts.<br />\\"Things We Said Today\\", another Paul number, is a reflective but mid-paced number distinctive in having that opening guitar riff that repeats itself after Paul finishes the chorus.<br />The last three songs are all John songs:  there's a kind of stomping rhythm in \\"When I Get Home\\", \\"You Can't Do That\\" is one of those jealous man songs that would figure later in Rubber Soul--e.g. \\"Run For Your Life\\".  The slightly gentler \\"I'll Be Back\\" seems to be an afterthought to \\"You Can't Do That\\".<br />Don't get me wrong--this is outstanding like their other efforts, but there was something about this album which struck me funny and then it hit me.  The lion's share of this album was sung by John.  Paul only sings three songs, George one, and Ringo none!  Still, one of their best.in the movie.  \\"Any Time At All\\" has John assuring a girl that \\"Anytime at all, all you gotta do is call and I'll be there.\\"<br />\\"I'll Cry Instead\\" has that late 50's sound the Beatles were used to covering in their early days.

The slightly gentler \\"I'll Be Back\\" seems to be an afterthought to \\"You Can't Do That\\".<br />Don't get me wrong--this is outstanding like their other efforts, but there was something about this album which struck me funny and then it hit me.  The lion's share of this album was sung by John.  Paul only sings three songs, George one, and Ringo none!  Still, one of their best.
B00000JCB2|1.0|This has got to be the worst album ever! And I have heard some pretty bad r&amp;b and rap over the years... First let me get started, these lyrics could have been written by a 10 year old. Just Like This is just whiteboy posturing. Nookie has to be the worst single ever on MTV. Of course those TRL kids just jumped on it. Nobody Like You at least has Jon Davis' vocals which help out. I really can't stand N2Gether Now. Partly because of the fact that Method Man appears and secondly because I really find it wrong for a white boy to try to get credentials in the rap community. Eminem is the only one who can get away with that. But he's not a damn redneck hick like Fred Durst. Rearranged is just a sad attempt at a ballad. If I could give this negative stars I would!
B000002L68|5.0|If 1999 was a warmup for Prince's stardom, it hit him like a bolt of purple lightning from the heavens, followed by an earthshattering thunderclap, for Purple Rain was Prince's supreme moment.  And Prince introduced a sound that incorporated a snarling guitar that owed a nod to Jimi Hendrix.<br />The organ and Prince's monolgue heralds \\"Let's Go Crazy\\", then comes the drum machine and that snarling guitar.  The song goes into full drive here and like \\"1999\\", is a song that brings life to any party.  The fiery guitar solo at the end is well worth the song.  There's a stab against psychiatrists who prescribe pills to their patients instead of real solutions.  \\"Instead of asking him how much of your time is left, ask him how much of your mind.\\"<br />The lush string-oriented \\"Take Me With U\\" is a mid-paced duet between Prince and his Purple Rain co-star Apollonia.  Her vocals are really prominent when the two sing \\"I don't care if we spend the night at your mansion\\" and the other four verses of the bridge, as well when they repeat the title line toward the end of the song.  Unless one has a copy of Apollonia 6 and her solo album, this is the closest one'll have of hearing her.<br />\\"The Beautiful Ones\\" about how the most beautiful women aren't necessarily the happiest, starts out as a slow ballad in Prince's falsetto, before he raises the power adrenaline several notches when screaming out \\"Do you want him, or do you want me, 'cause I want you.\\"  Matt Fink's piano- and later organ-sounding synthesizers provide a lush backing to this wonder.  It comes to a quiet close, with only Fink's and Bobby Z's drums.  Mariah Carey covers this on her Butterfly album to no avail.<br />\\"Computer Blue\\" starts out with a suggestive conversation between Wendy and Lisa.  \\"Wendy?\\"  \\"Yes Lisa?\\"  \\"Is the water warm enough?\\" \\"Yes Lisa.\\"  \\"Shall we begin?\\"  \\"Yes, Lisa.\\"  What actually takes place is a hard-pounding track featuring the lyrics at first, then fiery guitarwork throughout, climaxing in Prince's falsetto screams.  Bobby Z's percussion provides a strong backbeat throughout.  Love this one!<br />The grinding \\"Darling Nikki\\" has its notoriety about the title character and her house of eroticism, and is also the song that inflamed Tipper Gore.  And yes, it has another killer guitar solo and passionate Prince screams.  I wonder, are the last lyrics of that song the ones played backward at the end?<br />\\"When Doves Cry\\", which zoomed up to #1 to the charts in six weeks, punctuated by the percussion and keyboards, is yet further proof of premier songwriting and sound.<br />\\"I Would Die 4 U\\" which has a rippling fuzzy sound throughout, seems to be about God:  \\"I'm not a human/I'm a dove/I am your conscious/I am love.\\"  Then again, it might be Prince, as he's for love and peace.  It segues into \\"Baby I'm A Star\\", which rivals \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" in energy level.  It's simultaneously a declaratory statement by Prince to his audience of what he is and an assertion by the common person that an engaging personality will make him shoot to the stars.<br />The apocalyptic title track is one of the loveliest compositions Prince has done.  To hear it in anything other than its full 8:45 is sacrilege.  The lyrics come in up to 3:45, the song then becomes a thundering symphonic rock instrumental with a fusion of guitar, cello, violin, and viola.  For the last minute and three-quarters, the strings carry it through to its conclusion.<br />Every song on this album is so entwined together in Prince's unifying theme and sound that it's sometimes jarring to hear any of these songs on anywhere else but this album.  Anyone wanting to know why Prince made the impact he did should get this album, which is the first ever piece of music I bought sung by one artist.

B000002HAJ|4.0|I have to agree with the reviewer who said this album is more versatile. It is a beautiful album in every sense of the word. I haven't heard this album in some time, then on a drive home I listened to it with my girlfriend and I remembered all those times I spent alone with this album and how great it is! It has a little something for everyone. For those who love the Cure's &quot;pop&quot; side, there's &quot;High&quot; and &quot;Friday I'm In Love&quot; but I tend to prefer the Cure's emotional side. If you listen to &quot;Trust&quot; and &quot;To Wish Impossible Things&quot; and don't cry or feel any emotion, then you have a heart of stone. I also love &quot;A Letter To Elise&quot; and &quot;The Edge of the Deep Green Sea&quot; and of course the most underrated Cure track &quot;Doing The Unstuck&quot;. I would recommend this album (along with the singles collections) to anyone who is just getting started listening to the Cure. I believe this is the easiest album from thiers to get into.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I love this movie! It's great for the kids and funny for the adults.
0393317552|5.0|I love books like this - that get you looking at things from a perspective that is totally new.<br />So why did you not have Africans, mounted on zebras or rhinos, colonising Europe?<br />How was it that the Incas did not occupy Seville?  For that matter, how did the Spaniards, thousands of miles from home and vastly outnumbered, manage to subjugate a well-organised kingdom?<br />Plus a thousand other questions that would never have occurred to me to ask but, once asked, there has to be reason....  Jared Diamond asks the questions and then lucidly explains the answers.<br />This is book I have enjoyed reading and re-reading time and again.  I recommend it without reservation to anyone who wants to understand better and from unexpected new viewpoints, why the world is how it is.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I love this album.  I can't fathom why some people think Shakira's voice is awful; I guess it really comes down to a matter of taste.  Personally, I think her voice is extremely powerful, having the capacity to express depthless emotion.  Several of the songs on this album make me cry every time I hear them (e.g., Underneath Your Clothes, Que Me Quedes Tu).  Her lyrics alone have the capacity to stir something up deep inside, but add to the mix her heartbreakingly lovely melodies, and it's over, I'm a blubbering mess. <br />As for who is most likely to not just \\"like\\" but to \\"love\\" this album as much as I, I guess having some Spanish background or knowledge does not hurt.  I moved to America from Ecuador (Colombia's neighbor) when I was little.  As unique as her voice may sound to many non-Latinos, in a way to me her voice sounds rather comfortable and familiar for the wonderfully rich quality distinctive of the consummate Latina singer.  I think it's great that she retains that quality, and that she makes it work, when she sings in English.  Also, the instrumentals on \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" are reminiscent of Ecuadorian/Andean panpipe music that my father used to listen to as I was growing up.  So it's kind of funny because some people like \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" because it sounds new and exotic, but it fills me with aching nostalgia!!  Another reason why a Spanish background will help you love this album, is that without knowing Spanish it is hard to fully appreciate the shockingly beautiful combination of lyrics and melody that is \\"Y si me quedas tu . . . me queda la vi -i- da.\\"  *sigh*  That's perfection.  <br />Having said that, I would recommend this album for anybody that appreciates beautiful melodies and albums that alternate between making you want to cry and making you want to move.  Heck, it might even make you want to run out and learn Spanish to fully appreciate some of the songs.  I can't help but feel as if it would be worth the effort.
B000069HKH|3.0|Wow. The Boss is back with the E-Street Band to create an album to address the tragedy of 9/11 and the heroism that srang from the ashes! I anticipated the anger and passion of the old Bruce... the haunting melancholy tones and the uplifting hope expressed in the rich body of work that Springsteen has given us. But instead we see a overly engineered treatise that is devoid of emotion. This doesn't rise, it just sits there. Oh, there are some good licks here and there. But, there's not one good, memorable, singable song on the album. It's not moving or compelling. It's not that it's bad. It just ain't what we've come to expect from &quot;the Boss&quot;. This album is more like middle management.
0345451325|5.0|I was happily suprised to pull up other reviews of this book and find them glowing (as well they should be) since I came here with the intention of defending this story against all the \\"who cares about a book from a VIDEO GAME\\" people.<BR>To set the record straight (briefly) I'm a hard core gamer, an avid reader and an airforce firearms instructor.  <BR>I'm not here to rack up praise for this novel just because I loved the game (though it was spectacular!  anxiously awaiting the second chapter) but because it deserves a glowing review.<BR>When I first heard about the book I was truly worried.  I was too enthralled with the game to pass up a chance for a deeper look into the story but I was very concerned as to the quality of the writing.  My first thought was \\"gimick\\", but I took the plunge anyway.<BR>I can now say how thrilled I am to be proved wrong.<BR>Nylund did more than just fill in the background, he truly captured the essence of the story.  This is a novel first and foremost, not just \\"video game hype\\".  A work that easily stands on its own (With one exception, but I'm getting there).<BR>Nor do we simply follow the chief around growing up and getting a shiny green suit.  The whole Halo universe is built up and explained - the chief's 'recruitment', training and operations together with his fellow teammates (the SPARTANS) is detailed along with the first encounters with the Covenant, fleet engagements (it's fun to find out where Captain Keyes came from and his involved history with the MasterChief) and the general history of the human race up to the point where the game picks up.  You also get a more solid feel for the precarious nature of our situation that the game only hints at.<BR>The one shortcoming (if you choose to call it that, as some have) is that, while this story is a prequel, some experience with the game is necessary for the purposes of visualization.  What I mean is that Nylund expects you to know what things LOOK like before you start reading,so he doesn't go into a lot of description of things that were present in the game.  If you don't know what a warthog, hunter or Mojolnir suit look like before you start, you might be a little lost.  If you've played the game for even a few hours, you should have little difficulty, however, and even just looking at the box art on the game as well as the book cover should give you some frame of reference (assuming you haven't played the game yet...  and why not???)<BR>In summary, this is a book much deserving of praise.  There was obviously a lot of thought and research put into the creation of a truly solid story.  <BR>So if you're intrested in the world of Halo (as well as a little foreshadowing on the second game - Mr. Nylund worked with microsoft and bungie on this if I'm not mistaken) then ignore the \\"Video games are for kids\\" evil stigma and pick up an original, engrossing and fun book.
B00005YW4H|5.0|That one word describes this exciting young song stylist who's sense of timing, phrasing and sensuality paint lovely and beguiling imagery that truly soothes the soul. It is hard to believe that so many layers of feeling could be conveyed in a debut album. Yet, every time I hear it, I discover new depths of mystery.<br />You can analyze it all you want, but in the end, this is music to be sipped and savored like a rare vintage. It must be inhaled like an alluring perfume. It's unpretentious, and completely captivating. Nothing to do but surrender to the joy of it...and hope there's much more to come.
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce Springteen lay quiet in the 90's, enjoying a quiet life in New Jersey.  But after the hellish events of 9/11, he felt compelled to do an album about it.  He worked up the courage to ask victims' families what they felt after the attacks, and his research turned into the lyrics for the Rising.  They have a wide range, from the optimistic (Waiting on a Sunny Day) to the mellow (Nothing Man), and even the inane (Mary's Place).  But even with the different moods, Springteen's wordplay and robust delivery make all the more though-provoking, and memorable.<br />Springteen also has refocused his songwriting.  The album is diverse, with mellow acoustic songs (Nothing Man), hint-o-country rockers (Lonesome Day) and even gospel (My City of Ruins).  But ol' Bruce tackles them all, with the energy and fuvor of the E Street Band, back for their first album since Born in the U.S.A.  The classic members are back, including Steven Van Sandt (guitar), Clarence Clemons (Saxophones) Nils Lofgren (guitar) and Roy Bittan (keyboards) to name but a few.  <br />The first thing you notice about the revamped band, is they sound as vibrant as ever.  They're with Bruce every step of the way, giving the music a sense of youthfulness, making it seem this album could have been made in the early '70's.  Clemmons gives his bright sax sound to Mary's Place, Waitin' on a Sunny Day and makes the sound of the album of the album round and full.  I notice some people say the fiddle player has shoved Clarence to the back of the sound, not so.  His saxophone is peppered throughtout the album, intertwining with the fiddle, but neither one overpowering the other.<br />There's one other quaility that will make this album a classic a hundred years from now:  it is a time capsule for the months following 9/11, the twisting emotions that were at war in our inards.  It shows the image of America afterwards (though that image is somewhat marred by the propoganda whirlwind and Bushs' attempts to sway public opinion from one enemy to another).  But Bruce shows the spirit in its purest form: the willingness of all people to help one another move on and heal what they can.  In general, this albums' underlying theme shows the American Spirit the way it should be.  A few listens and you will feel it in the music.
0553573403|2.0|My biases: I love Goodkind, I like WOT but downhill seriously lately. I loved Eddings, Donaldson, Tolkien. I love magic, action, battles.<br />I always read any new fantasy series I start at least a hundred pages before tossing it out. As other reviewers have commented the book has little magic and action and is very political. A soap opera fantasy is probably a good way to describe it. Perhaps comparing Star Trek Deep Space Nine to the other Treks is helpful. I like all the other Treks but found DS9 to be a space soap opera and tossed it. This is what Game of Thrones is like.<br />I am very disappointed since, after reading other reviews, I was expecting great things from Game of Thrones. Starting the book is rather difficult also since the character you are reading about is constantly changing.<br />So I am out my 7 bucks.<br />If you haven't tried Terry Goodkind yet, I highly recommend his work. It blows WOT out of the water and continues to be extremely interesting and very moving.
B000002LIM|5.0|I loved the music from this soundtrack. I highly recommend it.
B00005JL7Q|1.0|I personally didn't like this movie.  Although it had its moments (when it made me chuckle) it really couldn't keep my attention.  <br />Thankfully this was my girlfriend's rental and I was able to do something more interesting while it was on such as paying my bills.<br />Next time I'll pick the movie!
B00003CXXM|1.0|Slow to get going. The film goes nowhere, and fast. I can't recommend it.
B00005JL78|4.0|This is a very entertaining DVD with lots of cool features to enjoy.  Spielberg really is the grand master of film in the modern age.<br />Unfortunately he is NOT philosophically consistent with the granduer he is able to present on the screen.  This movie had the potential to deal with some fascinating topics relating to freewill vs. fate or destiny.  It would have been bad enough if Spielberg had addressed the issue and come down on the wrong side of reality - but he doesn't even make a clear-cut stand with the plot resolution he gives. So at the end I was left feeling thrilled by the action and great special affects, but unaffected by the lack of real substance.<br />It will be a great day for film history if Spielberg ever gets his philosophy in tune with his sense of life.<br />Meanwhile, this is an enjoyable ride as long as you don't mind being left in the middle of nowhere at the end.
B000006OS2|3.0|This is a great movie, of course, but the quality of the DVD leaves a LOT to be desired.  The picture can be very blurry, and will sometimes zoom for no apparent reason onto nothing very important.  It's odd.  It's probably better just to get this on video.
0312305060|3.0|I like the author's style of writing, but the theme is redundent and although I like to see more written about the crossing of paths by women, I found this rather depressing. Read Nuns and Priests, the Great Divide by O'Mara for more about women crossing paths.
B000002H2H|3.0|A word of warning to latecomers to Metallica's work:  \\"Ride the Lightning\\" era Metallica bears ZERO resemblance to their hard rock work starting with 1991's \\"Metallica\\".  \\"Ride The Lightning\\" is pure thrash; it just doesn't get any harsher and faster than this.  I bought this album soon after it came out, in 1985, and it took me a full year of listening to truly appreciate its brilliance.  This album represented a quantum leap beyond the simplistic yet still memorable \\"Kill 'Em All\\"--the lyrics and the themes here are (as one reviewer has already noted) conceptually similar to what Iron Maiden was exploring on their albums \\"Piece of Mind\\" and \\"Powerslave\\" and what bands like Black Flag had explored from the start--alienation, fury and destruction.  A true missing link between punk and metal.  \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" is absolutely apocolyptic; \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is relentless (I have always thought of the music on this song as the soundtrack to nightmares), \\"Creeping Death\\" is outstanding.  Truly a classic.  Strongly recommended for people who think lame bands like System of a Down and Creed are \\"rock\\"--listen and learn.
B00000K3UU|5.0|The story of the film is really just about a guy named Sonny Koufax who has a cool life, where he has no job and basically no responsibilities, and a sexy girl friend. One day she gets fed up up with him and tells him to grow up and get a decent job. As his girl friend left he went over to see his room mate and as he entered his house everyone wasted the suprise on Sonny. Everyone was very disapointed because they wasted it on sonny when they wanted to say it to the other room mate who was leaving to china for a few weeks. As the room mate leaves Sonny gets a kid sent to him with a note saying that it was the room mates kid. Sonny called the room mate up and told him he had his kid right here. Sonny ended up looking after him and raising him to become like him which was very funny. Later on in the movie he visits his ex girl friend and tries to impress her with his kid, though things start to go wrong as Sonny finds out she's sleeping with a old man. HOW WILL SONNY WIN HER BACK!!!!!!!!! one of the funniest parts in the movie was when Sonny had a little talk yo by the kids teacher and the teacher had some very bad things to say about the kid which where very funny. Another funny bit was when the kid goes daddy can i have my night light, and so Sonny turns on a lit up sign saying live nudes with an arrow pointing to the right. I really loved this movie, it was very hillarious with more than 20 hillarious bits. It is one of the most hillarious films i had seen and the ending was very sweet and even through out the film it was sweet. Adam Sandler is a great actor and he had the most suitable part in the movie for him. Adam Sandler has done some great work and i hope he keeps up the great work. If you like this film i suggest you go see the new movie with him in, mr deeds and believe me you won't regret it, but i have to say mr deeds was not as funny as big daddy, but it is great and i hope more people in the world start to know more about Adam Sandler and understand whyhe is such a great funny sweet actor. If i had to have a favourite Adam sandler movie it would propbably be waterboy, which was a very sweet touching film. So yeah overall a great film worth watching, SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!!!!!! GET OFF YOUR CHAIR AND GO HIRE THIS VIDEO!!!!!! AND SLAP THIS BABY ONTO YOUR VIDEO PLAYER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000666DW|5.0|As hardcore progressively divides itself into a plethora of sub-genres, you have bands that fill the mold, and then you have Mastodon.  I could go into how intense and free-flowing the everchanging drum sequences are over the course of each track, or how ingeniously the guitarwork compliments the band's clever use of shifting time signatures, and how the vocalist seems to be more of an aural destructive force rather than that of a singer.  Instead of discussing these things, I will just urge you to listen to this album in any way possible, because it breathes new life into the realm of hardcore! k!
0060989157|5.0|This is the most amazing behind the scenes look at a heavy metal band addicted to sex, drugs and (when they weren't preoccupied with those) rock and roll. Motley Crue, in my opinion, exceeds the stereotypical rocker expectations the general public may have about musicians.  Before I read The Dirt, I couldn't even name one Crue tune. The only reason I even decided to read this book (which my husband bought) was because I was stuck at work during a snowstorm with nothing to do. Then I became addicted to The Dirt. I just can't figure out how four guy's who lived such a wild life full of over consumption even lived to tell their story.  Through heroin overdoses, vehicular manslaughter, coke binges, orgies, orgies, and orgies, they survived.  I started reading this book not knowing a thing about Motley Crue, and now I can name all of Vince's ex-wives, Nikki's drugs of choice, Tommy's police charges, and Mick's medical woes.  I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to read something interesting. ...
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Director/Screenwriter Richard Kelly's debut is absolutely incredible.  I first saw this film on HBO, flipping channels and just expecting another movie.  After ten minutes, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  I immediately ordered the DVD because I had to watch it again.  Yes, be warned, you'll probably have to watch this movie multiple times before you fully grasp it.  It's easy to see why this movie didn't go mainstream, but rahter has become somewhat of a cult classic.  Jake Gyllenhaal was incredible, especially considering he was only 19 when this was filmed.  The rest of the cast was perfect too, which you might not think looking at some of the names.  All in all, a must have for any film buff's collection.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|Ok, first thing I have to say is that, The Kids Aren't Alright song hits the nail on the head. It's the best song on the cd and they need to do more like it. The 2nd best is She's Got Issue's and the 3rd is Pretty Fly. The rest of them are ok.
B0000640VO|5.0|Through a variety of tiny, selfless acts, Amelie touches the people around her, changing their lives in small, yet immeasurably vast ways. She reconnects a man with his childhood. She sparks passion between two lonely people. She brings closure to a mourning woman through a voice from the past. She subtly and deliciously avenges the abuses a mean-spirited employer heaps on a mentally slow but well-meaning assistant. And she sends her own father around the world through the eyes of a simple garden gnome.<br />Amelie is shy. She's empathetic. She's inventive. And, wherever she goes, she dips her hands in sacks of grain and collects flat stones for skipping. Actress Audrey Tautou is perfect in the role, a winsome young woman with huge, deep eyes and a fey smile to steal your heart away.
6301967992|5.0|Magnificent.  Humourism, terror and inteligent interpretation of Roman Polanski and all others
B00005RFAI|2.0|I don't understand the hype surrounding Pink. Her first album was wwwaaayyy better than this mess she calls,\\"Missundaztood\\". The only songs I like are:<br />Get The Party Started<br />18 Wheeler<br />Missundastood<br />But the rest of the album bored me to tears. But lets give credit where credit is due, at least her \\"punkness\\" is more real than Avril.
B00004WGBE|5.0|Excellent acting by everyone here, but Toby Stevens is  Hot! Hot! Hot!
B000024A70|5.0|In my opinion this album is better than the blue collections that we see in stores today. I know the album with different order of the songs (Similar to the japanese one without the bonus track, so I prob. know the original recording.) but Queen is still the Queen even in a different robe. This album is amazing and gives truly the best of Queen. It's one of those albums that you put in your CD player while driving, and it makes you feel cool as if you were driving a Ferari. It's fun to hear it with friends (The famous scene in Wayne's world, where they sing Bohemian Raphsody? It's so true!) and you never really tiered of it. If you don't know Queen and want a money-worth album, this is the one, and if you know Queen, than you already have it and you don't need my advice :-).
B00004RFFM|3.0|On the surface, Deep Blue Sea is a fair successor to Jaws. The action is intense enough to keep the viewer guessing, and it's abrupt enough to keep your eyes riveted to the screen. However, logic fails often along the way (for instance, when considering the ease with which the sharks navigate the shallow waters of the lab) and the deaths -- including the alleged shocker in the penultimate scene -- were fairly predictable.<br />Worse yet, many of the computer-generated scenes of finny death were cartoon-like and therefore unconvincing. On the plus side, Saffron Burrows strips down to her undies.<br />Deep Blue Sea is a fine way to pass an evening if you're looking for a surface-level thriller. Just don't expect much depth.
6300215814|5.0|BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S is a delightful, charming romantic-comedy that showcases Audrey Hepburn at her quirky best. Though there will always be debates about which film was Hepburn's best, BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S is always mentioned and is probably the film that best captured both Hepburn's talent as an actor and her real life personality. The film also stars George Peppard and growing up in the 1980's it is nice to see what the A-Team's Hannibal looked like as a young man. I love watching this movie and it is especially fun to watch with someone you love; they don't make many romantic films like this anymore. What more can one say?
B00005R2M3|3.0|This album was a mixed bag for me. Shakira get alot of respect for crossing over from Spanish to English, but she still needs alot of work. Her songwriting is good, but its hard to give it 100% respect when you don't know what she is saying. Her vocals actually takes away from the greatness of her songs. While Alanis's vocals aren't perfect, she at least tries to arrange her vocals around the song. Shakira sometimes just goes off the edge with her vocals, even when its not necessary. A perfect example is \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\", her vocals on the bridge part killed that song for me. Also she needs some help with her production. Compared to her early Spanish albums, the sound and the music on this album sounds pretty cheap. I admire her for being different, but she needs some work.
B00003CXXM|5.0|This is one of those movies where random elements came together to make the movie special. What I mean is: it turned out better than most had expected. There is a lot left to the imagination in such a way that you are not disappointed but actually surprised at it's appeal because you end up filling in the gaps by yourself in a way that is the most entertaining to you. Maybe it's just me, but the Bourne Identity is my favorite movie of 2002.<br />With that said, you won't be disappointed any way it's sliced. It's a spy movie with a ruthless plot and realistic motives that are actually kinda chilling. Nice production value and killer acting. punya. enjoy, don't miss, buy because everything else coming out right now is l-a-m-e (01/03). On a side note, I saw the 80's version and it's pretty dated.
B000002KET|5.0|Some people seem to putdown Sabbath Bloody Sabbath cause they say that a little too soft for Black Sabbath but I think that it's great that they can make softer music and even Volume 4 was softer than their first three albums, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is a killer classic, A National Acrobat is a beautiful masterpiece with a great guitar solo at the end of the song, and another accoustic instrumental song Fluff is perhaps the most spookiest instrumental of them all, Sabbra Cadabbra is a love song with a beautiful guitar/synthesizer sound, Killing Yourself to Live is one of Sabbath's best songs and it could of been easily penned by Kurt Cobain. Who Are You is perhaps a little too overly synthesized but it's a good song by any means, Looking For Today is perhaps the weakest track on this album but it's better than most of the post Dio/Sabbath era, and the closing track is the melodic Spiral Archeitect, which has the walking on the ocean feel to it and is another Black Sabbath standout.<br />Also featured on this album is Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman who does the keyboards on this album and he should've stayed with Black Sabbath instead of Geoff Nicholls, who later joined Black Sabbath in 1979 after Ozzy Osbourne left and Geezer Butler left for a short time too.<BR>If you're a fan of progressive rock as well as Black Sabbath, then you should get this album cause all four members of the original Black Sabbath are extremely talented musicians.<br />Discography<BR>Black Sabbath                           1970<BR>Paranoid                                1970<BR>Master of Reality                       1971<BR>Volume 4                                1972<BR>Sabbath Bloody Sabbath                  1973<BR>Sabotage                                1975<BR>We Sold Our Souls For Rock 'N' Roll     1976<BR>Techincal Ecstasy                       1976<BR>Never Say Die                           1978<BR>Heaven and Hell                         1980<BR>Live at Last1980<BR>The Mob Rules                           1981<BR>Live Evil                               1983<BR>Born Again                              1983<BR>Seventh Star                            1986<BR>Eternal Idol                            1987<BR>Headless Cross                          1989<BR>TYR                                     1990<BR>Dehumanizer                             1992<BR>Cross Purposes                          1994<BR>Forbidden                               1995<BR>Reunion                                 1998<BR>Past Lives                              2002<BR>Symptom of the Universe 1970-78         2002
6305090564|3.0|I like Treat Williams. I like Famke Janssen. I like movies about ships lost at sea, and the toothy creatures that lurk in its depths and look on people as savory entrees. Oh, and I definitely like the Alien series.<br />All that explains why I sort of enjoyed Deep Rising, a rollercoaster of a movie that tosses all pretense of originality out the window from the get-go and focuses on doing the same old thing in a fun and flashy way.
0345448898|5.0|Look, any book with violence and scary scenes should be look at carefully before being given you your children, but come on - it's fiction, not fact!  If you can't present anything but well-worn dogma to your kids, then these books are not for you.  If you are able to articulate clearly to your kids why you disagree with the premises of this story, then you might have some very deep and wonderful conversations about the meaning of your beliefs and just what it means to have God in your life.  These are beautifully written books that should delight most any reader who isn't afraid to simply contemplate another point of view.  Condemn it as wrong, evil, etc., if you must, but it is a wonderful, epic story that Pullman has written.
B00006879E|4.0|I was referred to Maroon 5 by an old Guitar player buddy of mine,From an old band i was in with him. He told me to Download &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;,and &quot;This Love&quot; I dug them as soon as i heard the opening Ill Melodies of Harder To Breathe,Adam Levine has a knack for pulling off such Melodies over a funk/rock Rhythm and Disciplined Percussion Beats. Being a drummer myself,i quickly appreciated Their drummers ability to keep the groove,and stay in &quot;The Pocket&quot;. I read a customer review on this site,who was a rocker,and said this album was horrible. Well i am a HUGE rocker myself listening to groups such as Incubus, Flaw,Chevelle,Taproot, and so on,and although Maroon 5 comes nowhere NEAR those bands level of &quot;Heaviness&quot; any GOOD musician or rocker, can be open minded to Maroon 5's Vivid World of Heart Break and even in someways Strength in Which they provide on &quot;Songs about Jane&quot; Some good tracks Are &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;,&quot;This Love&quot;, &quot;She will Be Loved&quot; &quot;Tangled&quot; &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;Through With you&quot;. if you are into bands like Coldplay, DMB,John Mayer,and Jamiroquai (man is that band from the ole days or what?) or if you are an OPEN MINDED Listener or musician of all Genres Pick this CD up. What The Strokes are to New York, Maroon 5 is to HollyWood!
0060931736|5.0|Spark's book is written like a fairy tale.  The story isn't vague.  I was delighted by the eccentric Miss Brodie and her unorthodox methods of educating her &quot;Brodie set&quot;.  Jean Brodie's emotional and physical reliance on &quot;her girls&quot; is decidedly exploitive.  I had no idea Muriel Spark is this talented.  I'll have to read more of her work.  The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is a tale with a sting on the end of it.
B000065U1N|1.0|I very rarely walk out on movies, no matter how boring or bad. But I walked out on this piece of trash. Ridley Scott's gloss on a sorry chapter in American military history may have had the good luck to cash in on America's new found patriotism, but it does so with a pointless jingoistic story, far too many characters to keep track of, no real message at all and an awfully racist sensibility that truly disgusted me.<br />As has been said on this site before, 18 americans died. While certainly I don't want to minimize the sufferings of the real men and there families here, it is important to remember that many more Somalis were killed: 10,000 in the entire war, and roughtly 1,000 in the conflict described. While it's debatable that the 10,000 Somalis died as a direct result of US intervention, the smaller number definately did. This greater proportion of Somali suffering is all but ignored in the movie. Somalis are portrayed mostly as bloodthirsty and savage. And they are contrasted to the noble, self-sacrificing and ALL-WHITE American soldiers. (I find it hard to believe that, in today's army, there could possibly be an all-white division. In fact, I know for a fact that there wasn't in this war.) The scene where the mob of Somalis, including women and children savagly beat the disabled Americans to death was more than I could take and I walked out.<br />Leaving politics aside, this is also poor moviemaking. The documentary style of the movie has been hailed as the most realistic portrayal of war on film. That may be, but this is exactly what makes this a poor film artistically. The bouncing of the camera makes watching this on a large screen painful. The plotting and dialogue (what little there is) is poorly drawn and the characters are at best two dimensional. I doubt that anyone who has only seen the film once can remember most of the names of the characters or differentiate one from another. As a result, the movie is pretty empty of any real emotional content.<br />If you like war movies, there are many more that, while perhaps not as realistic, tell their stories much better than this tripe. Rent Bridge Over the River Kwai again, perhaps one of the most intelligent and thoughtful war movies of all time. Or Saving Private Ryan, Glory, Catch 22, MASH, or Full Metal Jacket. All of these movies in varying degrees capture more of the full contradictions of war and all have a defined point of moral point of view. You may not agree with that point of view, but at least they attack the subject intelligently. That's much more than can be said for Blackhawk Down.<br />If you like war movies, there are many more that, while perhaps not as realistic, tell their stories much better than this tripe.

B00004T37H|5.0|The artwork of this film is astonishing. Set primarily in the forests of ancient Japan, the scenery is lush with life, vivid with depth and detail. The scenery is in some cases so gorgeous it will take your breath away.<br />But the story, too, stands out from the crowd. Written by Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki and adapted into English by writer Neil Gaiman, Princess Mononoke is the story Ferngully wanted to be. It tells of a great clash between humans and nature, with the animal gods and forest spirits rallying to stave off encroaching devasation. The archetypal figures, such as the Night Walker, are magnificent, but there are also the smaller gods and fey beings for a lighter touch.
B000066NW0|4.0|I'm a guy. and I'll have to admit that this hot chick has got some talent. and to me there are to versions of punk, 1 the trend and, 2 the music. she has the punk trend mixed with... well I don't really know what the hell this music style is but it isn't pop. pop bites. I think you poeple that wrote bad reviews just need to admit that they like it and stop trying to be cool by following the &quot;cool&quot; kids and hating it. I know you like it. and at least I have the (guts) to admit she is good and has real potential. you know what? I just figured out the style of music, it's chick punk. cause be honest how many girl punk rockers are there. anyway, good music, hot chick, punk trend, chick punk music.why the four star rating? It's good but not real punk. so 4 stars. hope next time she put out a REAL punk album.e and a while, I think it must be a Canadian voice thing. In the pop world this first effort is outstanding.<br />Avril's music is rather youthfu, comparing her to Courtney Love or Tori Amos is just silly. These musicians are aware of the audiance they hold and have a deep understanding of what music they love and play. I doubt Avril has a connection to her guitar as Tori does to her piano. Wait until Avril is in her 20's and I'm sure she will be back with an album that truly rocks on a higher level. Look how much Madonna grew over the years, and all the styles of music she has dabbled in. Now, no matter what others say, Madonna is the goddess of electronia vocals.<br />If punk is truly the genre Avril is interested in trust me when I say she will rock the future, not many young artist sound this good. She has the voice, she has the look, she has the attitude and she has the right sylist. I can feel her attitude pushing through all the pop that has been laced within her album. I look forward to her musical growth, for now Let Go is a very impressive start. whether she and her team continue to churn out songs that sit on both sides of the fence -- quality andcommercial appeal. But, based on &quot;Let Go,&quot; she's got an enormous amount of talent. If her sophomore album improves as Pink's did, then the sky's the limit.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Watching the movie, I was thinking to myself: &quot;Self, don't a few of these pieces sound like some of the pre-Boingo stuff from Danny Elfman?&quot;  I was blown away by many of the numbers and when I saw Danny's name in the credits, and went right out to get the soundtrack the next day.  That night I played the CD for a group of friends (with diverse musical tastes) at a party and it was a big hit.<br />The album has many very catchy tunes -- my favorites are &quot;All that Jazz&quot;, &quot;Mister Cellophane&quot;, &quot;We Both Reached for the Gun&quot;, &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot;, and &quot;When You're Good to Mamma&quot;.  Zeta-Jones and Latifah were excellent and Richard Gere and John Reilly were very memorable as well.  <br />On the downside, Zellweger was mediocre -- nice voice, but dull.  The bonus vocal material (that didn't appear in the movie) was all very poor, but I don't think that detracts from the dozen other outstanding tracks.  Also, I thought the engineering on the &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot; was a little weak.  The lows are too soft.<br />Jason
B000002H3E|4.0|This is it. This is the album that shot Dokken up the charts and people really got into them. This is when they were all over MTV and were one of the biggest bands in the world for a short time. And for good reason. This album is very good. \\"Unchain The Night\\", \\"The Hunter\\", \\"In My Dreams\\", & \\"It's Not Love\\" are the big hits here. \\"Slippin' Away\\" is a pretty decent ballad. They were trying to make another \\"Alone Again\\", and didn't quite succeed. Even the 'filler' is pretty good. If you get one Dokken CD (besides their greatest hits), I recommend this or \\"Back For The Attack\\". Just get both. You will not regret it.
B00000099Y|5.0|I cant explain the impact this album had on me.  The more i listened to it over the years, the more layers unfolded.  On the surface, every track is listenable with strong textures and rhythms.  The subject of the lyrics are kept subtle while Keenan treats his voice as a compliment to the instrumentation.  I learned alot about music as a teenager just from listening to Aenima.  Colors, dynamics, brilliant organic form, and raw emotion are the essence of this album.  A true classic and belongs in everyones music collection.
B000021YQV|5.0|For those who know System of a Down from their self titled debut this album is an all love and respects due follw-up.<br />System offer a rich, thick and unique blend of raw talent and fast paced passion. Taking an original spin on a metal-punk(even dare I say &quot;carnival&quot;) fusion, System encourage thier listener to cast aside commercialism and purely enjoy what diffrences free-thinking can promote.<br />System of A Down push the envelope of originality and remain a powerhouse for the future of rock music.
B00003CXXP|2.0|Spielberg's die-hard fans or followers will disagree, but this film was boring enough to not watching it till the end. When I was waiting for some better scenes (some action, something interesting), the story came with a disgusting part that made me stop it right there.
B000066NW0|3.0|(...)I found the CD pretty mediocre at best and definitely overly childish, but there were some highlights. The music is definitely better than most of the pathetically simple and juvenile lyrics (I could write better lyrics at age 12)<br />Losing Grip - A surprisingly good song, though none of the songs are really all that great. Nice melody and the words are actually pretty good. I can relate to the situation.<BR>Complicated - Um, well, what can I say. Its got a catchy tune. I like the lyrics a lot, its got a good message (disregarding the fact that Avril herself doesn't seem to follow her own advice). So overplayed though that I can no longer stand listening to it.<BR>Sk8er Boi (it pains me to type that) - Bah. No. Sickeningly catchy and sickeningly stupid.<BR>I'm With You - A little too sappy, and God help the crooning at the end, but a decent song with a nice melody. <BR>Mobile - Catchy like most, but not one of my favorites<BR>Unwanted - My favorite song on the CD, the guitars sound good (its not her) and its produced well. The lyrics are so-so but I really like listening to it, and its actually borderline rock unlike the others.<BR>Tomorrow - Personally found it boring and I usually skip it, the tune didn't catch me<BR>Anything But Ordinary - Sorta cute, but shallow. I found myself cringing that THESE are this girl's biggest problems in life. Must be nice to be her.<BR>Things I'll Never Say - Cute love song. Too cute. But I'll admit that I do like the song in its own pop-kiddy way. Yes, oddly, even the yodeling.<BR>Nobody's Fool - MAKE. IT. STOP...!!!<BR>Too Much to Ask - Decent, one of the better songs. Music was good, most of the lyrics were all right, aside from the beginning (talking about weed and \\"you're so lame\\" kinda killed the feeling of the song for me)<BR>Naked - Also decent.<br />Hope you found this a little more helpful for purchasing than people's rants on Avril and society.er own style, she thinks for herself, she doesnt let ANYONE or ANYTHINGget in the way of what she wants to do. She's my #1 idol. I'm her #1 fan.
0553573403|5.0|I have to admit I was first attracted to this book by the shiny red bar that boasted \\"the fantasy novel of the year!\\".... and after having read it over 7 times I have to say that I was not let down at all. This book will surpass the expectations of any fantasy reader. It steps away from the traditional storytelling of the genre and enters an extremely complex and intriguing realm that always keeps you guessing. All of the characters are captivating, grounded and real, be they 9 years old or ancient. This book is centered on a realm dominated by the weaknesses of human kind, and the plot is at once compelling and destructive. It will bring you to fear, to tears, and always leave the fleeting hope of the peace and human salvation to loom tantalizingly in the horizon- but leaves you questioning if it is reachable.<br />Do NOT expect a traditional \\"happily ever after\\" ending from this unique series. This is definitely not a book for the faint-hearted or fastidious, and is not a novel for those seeking a fairytale realm where goodness always prevails. Martin manages to draw out the many aspects of human nature that characterize human failings and fallibility. Rather than prominently display darkness and light in the fashion of Tolkien, Eddings, Jordan, and other fantasy writers, \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" are never distinctly defined in Martin's novel. Instead, he writes it as it is in the real world, where good and evil are two intertwined capacities inherent in unpredictable human behaviour.<br />This is an extremely enthralling saga whose philosophy does not allow readers the chance to clearly believe \\"that there is still some good left in the world, and that it is worth fighting for\\" (a la Samwise Gamgee), but instead invites us to a critical reexamination of the many different shades of human nature.
B00000099Y|5.0|TOOL are the definitive modern band for rock musics capabilities.<br />Never before or after this album had I heard more amazing and talented rock perfection untill Lateralus graced us in 2001.<br />Tool seems to have no peak as each album peels back more layers and presents us all with even more fluidity and richness and talent in every movement.<br />I have no tatoo's despite my love for music and if I was presented with the need to get one it would be the 4 letters of TOOL. Tool continue to help people open thier hearts and minds through thier precise and spiritual message to be real and live life fully one breath at a time, in a manner that rocks so amazingly.
1587990717|4.0|As other reviewers have pointed out, this book is not a trading manual. If you are looking for usable market techniques, look elsewhere. However, for those with a classical bent, who enjoy the history of ideas and occasionally even wonder about topics more metaphysical than where the Dow closed today, this is a nice read. Mr. Taleb selects a few lessons from probability theory as applied to the markets, and illustrates them with characters drawn (presumably) from his own life or from his considerable literary knowledge. We learn, for example, why if we watch our portfolios too closely we may be unhappy even with a winning record, why working hard to get that home in the best neighborhood may make our lives miserable, and how our best hope against the depredations of Fortune is personal dignity. Read this for perspective, not portfolio advice.

As a member of the Beatles generation who saw them for the first time on Ed Sullivan, I am so happy my children think The Beatles were as great as I think they are.

B00005JL78|4.0|Steven Spielberg is a very hit or miss director. Fortunately when he misses, he's never worse than mediocre, and fortunately he didn't miss on Minority Report.<br /><br />Plenty of other places will tell you what Minority Report is about so I won't waste your time repeating it here. But I will tell you that this is Spielbergs first Noir film. Film noir is somewhat of a rarity in hollywood these days and it's not to be unexpected given the hollywood mainstream's lack of appreciation for it. Even more rare is sci-fi noir, or future noir, which is basically mixing film noir with a futuristic setting; the most notable of which being Ridley Scott's Bladerunner almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Like Bladerunner, Spielberg tells a tale based on a story by the great Philip K. Dick and he does so with an equal amount of competence. Minority Report isn't the strongest source material from Philip Dick (which is why it probably wasn't done before), but it does have the quintessential characteristics of any great Philip K. Dick story in it's philosophy or question there of.<br /><br />While this film was marketed as a summer action blockbuster, at it's heart it's a very philosophical film that really makes you think about your own views on life. Spielberg is brilliant at selling you on the idea of precrime then later revealing it's problems while never once being biased. In the end it's hard to really tell if it's good or bad, and has you thinking (just like every other good film based on a Philip K. Dick story) long after the credits roll. Indeed I now own this on DVD and subsequent viewings haven't ended the philosophical debate I have with myself of the films ideas.<br /><br />There were two real problems I had with the film. _SPOILER ALERT_ The first and most major was with the character played by Max Von Sydow. He comes across much too sinister and creepy (trademark for the actor) for you not to suspect he's the killer. This character really needed to be played by someone extremely likable (such as the late Richard Harris). When Sydow is revealled to be the character, one is hardly shocked, and I think it is most detrimental to the story. _SPOILER END_ Second (and Spielberg seems to have a problem with this) the film just seems to run too long. I don't mean the running time is too long, I just mean that Spielberg really seems to take his time telling the story. For a movie of this nature, which is as much an action/adventure movie as it is a mystery, this really detracts from the experience. This isn't to say the film is bad because of it. In fact, Spielberg has made masterpieces with a much more liesurely pace than this film (ie E.T., A.I., Schindler's List), but none of those films were billed as an action film.<br /><br />Visually, Spielberg chose to reflect the style of the movie by modifying the look of the film. He's done this before in the washed out, hand held photography of Saving Private Ryan and most notably in the black and white Schindler's List. This time Spielberg uses a technique in the development process that leaves out a step causing the film to look rough and the colors very cold with orange hues coming off very pale and bright. This was meant to reflect the cold and detatchment of the film's setting. While it may not be as effective as in his other films, it really doesn't detract from the film.<br /><br />The DVD is presented in a nice 2-disc set with the first disc devoted to outstanding sound and visual presentation of the feature and nothing but. The second disc is loaded with plenty of background material and documentaries. There is a lack of commentary by Spielberg as has come to be expected in his films; he doesn't like doing them. However, why can't we at least have a screenwriter/producer commentary?<br /><br />This film holds up well to subsequent viewings and is a good addition to just about any DVD collection. It may not be a Spielberg masterpiece (but face it how many films are?), but it's definatelyno miss which means it's a hit.efinately no miss which means it's a hit.
B00007KWHN|5.0|Yes is arguably the best of not most well-known progessive rock band. Audiophiles and progressive rock fans especially appreciate the best sound possible on this complex music.  This newly remastered (by Bill Inglot and Rhino) version of &quot;The Yes Album&quot; greatly improves upon the the original cd release of this set which I already owned.  The biggest difference for me is the greater clarity of Bill Bruford's drumming and Steve Howe's adept guitar work.  The harmony vocals are also more noticeable.  The album itself one of the group's best is almost a greatest hits collection.  I think every song except &quot;A Venture&quot; has remained in the group's concert set even to this day.  This proved to be Tony Kaye's last album with the band for a long time but his organ playing is good on this set.  He apparently left or was forced out because he resisted using some of the newer synthesizer technology which was becoming available at this time.  With this set the band finally achieved their goal of playing complex arrangements but utilizing catchy and memorable harmonies which remain in your head long after the song is finished.  Songs such as &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot;, &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; and &quot;I've Seen All Good People&quot; prove this point and the latter two were issued in edited form as single versions included here as bonus tracks.  The other main reason for puchasing the set is the inclusion of the unissued studio version of &quot;Clap&quot; which is Steve Howe's acoustic guitar picking tour de force.  The song appears of the album in an energetic live version but the studio version is not only longer but also clearer in sound.  If you do not already have this album pick it up immediately especially considering the improvement in sound quality and the addition of three bonus tracks.  Another plus is the detailed booklet included with great pictures, song lyrics and details about the album sessions. Great job Rhino! I can't wait for thenext batch of remasters!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I've always been *really* impressed by the epic scale of this album.  It's great, one of the best ever, etc. etc.  But it seemed really open-ended and the last few songs start drooping it, and making it feel like \\"we are just trying to make this album have twelve songs because that's what we've always done.\\"  <br />If you want to get into Radiohead, and you keep getting told to buy this one (\\"Oh just go on and buy it! It's OK COMPUTER!\\"), well, you shouldn't.  Do not, I repeat, Do NOT get this album first.  Go buy Amnesiac or The Bends, because you won't be able to get into this one properly otherwise.<br />That said.<BR>     This is really one of the ten best albums ever made.  The overlying theme of technology is one that's been gloated over in all the thickest reviews, but I thought I'd reiterate it here.  Here is a band coming off of two rocking albums, but they found something to say, and they put it together in a beautiful package.  This album wants you to know that your life is small, so you'd better do something with it.<br />Radiohead acheived a great balance of lyrics with music.  I mean, that guitar solo in Paranoid Android will blow anyone away.  You play that for a hundred people, ninety-nine will go on and buy the album.  The music's that good.<br />The lyrics are better.  I don't know about you, but just after a crescendo and a massive blaring sound wall/what have you (God knows what they put in there) on Exit Music, hearing Thom Yorke exclaim in that vulnerable voice of his \\"we hope that you choke\\" is exactly the kind of stuff bands need to do more of.  And the last minute-thirty of Let Down is the real climax of the record.  This IS music.  I've heard all the classics.  I own all the classics.  And I can confidently say that this is the most intensehauntingmovingchokingdesperatethoughtprovokingblindingclimactic moment in rock history.<br />Buy this album.  Learn it.  Live it.  But don't get it first.  Save it until you're ready to be blown away.
1573225517|5.0|After seeing the movie starring John Cusack, I had to read the book.  It was even better than I expected.  Very witty humor and very believable characters.  This is one book that I have read multiple times since I purchased it a few years ago.  You just can't grow tired of it.  Definately worthy of the main characters top 5.
B000001ZS4|5.0|This was the first album I bought by Jean_Michel Jarre, and I was very pleased by it! Though it has a new-age feel to it in some parts, it's not really a style of music that can be categorized so easily. There is a unique variety to Jarre's music. Upbeat, somber, wild, and subtle, this album displayes a considerable amount of musical variety (as do most of Jarre's other works).<br />This remains one of my top 15 musical favorites.
B00005NWM3|3.0|Many of you may find Nickelback's Silver Side Up release rather disappointing. It all depends on how well you like their radio hits. If you really like &quot;Never Again&quot; and &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; and nothing else, this album won't disappoint you. However, if your looking for other strong tracks on the album, you'll be highly disappointed. I don't think the album is horrible, nor do I think it's all that exciting. It is a solid release, but is lacking a solid set of high-quality tunes. I would suggest that you purchase &quot;Curb&quot; before purchasing this album. 3 Stars.
B00004XPP0|5.0|What can I say? Star Wars defined what Science Fiction could be, and revolutionized the movie industry. Quality movie-making at its best! <br />Not only does George Lucas give us an engaging story with fun characters, but he also presents us with an entire galaxy to explore! <br />For those who are fortunate enough to have seen these movies on the big screen, Star Wars was a life-changing event for many. The trilogy has influenced television, books, games, stories, clothing styles and more (not to mention other movies), and is recognized by anyone who hears its title.
0316666343|4.0|I loved this book.  It was told beautifully and with great detail.  You actually thought you were Susie Salmon looking down from Heaven.  The ONLY problem with the story was that her remains were never found and the killer was never brought to justice.  But maybe that is part of the allure and great storytelling!  Great read...
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is one of the best films of 2001- the most vibrant and beautiful movie I have ever seen on the silver screen. I bought it as soon as it came out on DVD, and I watch it whenever it's on HBO (which is often). Even after seeing it for the 500th time, I still am amazed by the phenomenal singing by Ewan Mcgreggor and Nicole Kidman, and this being Kidman's singing debute! If nothing else, buy it for the humour of the first half, or the sadness of the last (for those who like a good cry). Over all, this is movie magic, so buy it and love it!:)
B00006RIO7|4.0|I'm so glad to see how well this movie is doing, because I'm a huge fan of the movie musical and I'd like to see it come back to the mainstream. This CD, a collection of songs from the movie plus a couple more, is a good listen with only a few weak points.<br />The bad first -- the Queen Latifah/Macy Gray/Lil' Kim remake of \\"The Cell Block Tango\\" is simply dreadful and has no place on this album other than to help market it. It's a bad song and it doesn't fit with the tone of the rest of it -- that's the biggest problem for me. It's totally out of place.<br />Fortunately, that's the ONLY problem for me. When I heard the cast for this movie I was skeptical, but everyone did an outstanding job: Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Renee Zellweger, John C. Reilly and Queen Latifah (when she's not rapping) are all perfect fits for their parts, both as actors and singers. This album takes all of the energy and love for the material shown in the film and allows it to shine through. I'll keep this in steady rotation in my CD player at least until the DVD comes out.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Let's get real folks - Robin Trower was a talented guitarist but he is no Hendrix or Stevie Ray Vaughn.  Trower's expertise was in the creation of atmosphere, not virtuoso technique. <br />I love \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" which is a unique and strong song. There are other good songs such as \\"In this Place\\" which I always thought of as the back end of Bridge of Sighs.  The 24 bit remastering is a significant improvement on the original. Whoever did the remastering deserves considerable credit. There is are no skippers on the whole CD as Robin's playing and Jim Dewar's voice bring something special to every song.<br />While the live recordings leave something to be desired sonically, there has been some near magical engineering to these recordings made shortly after the original release of \\"Bridge of Sighs.\\" They certainly add to the original CD.<br />This is certainly a worthwhile addition to any collection. While I had to retire the album because I wore out the groove to \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" this will not be a problem on the CD.
0446677450|1.0|The raving reviews from friends compelled me to read this book.  It's an interesting book, to say the least.  Below I listed the pros and cons:<BR> -- Easy-to-read, but poor writer  <BR> -- Motivational speaker, but book has little substance<BR> -- Interesting story, but not factual <BR> -- Teaches about success, but he himself lack credentials <BR> -- Provides real estate investing examples that are enticing, but does not mentions it's feasibility<br />My advice is:  Buys this book if you enjoy reading fictious stories about finance and want to contribute to Kiyosaki's ONLY source of wealth.  If you prefer a nonfictional and practical book about finance, make sure you research the author's background.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is one of those books that forces you to think about the message that is sending. Much like the character, Alex, we are forced to see things and think of things that we would rather not. Alex starts out as a gangster with no morals.  After he is arrested, he becomes the subject of a new government program that's policies asks the reader if morals can be forced upon someone. And if they are forced, is their any point. This story never slows down and is a great quick and very direct reading that will stay with you for a long time.
B00006RJHG|5.0|This movie still freaks me out whenever I see it.  Very well done and very creepy.  Performances are wonderful and very believable.... Margot Kidder & Olivia Hussey are excellent in this film.  Whenever the phone rang I jumped and I actually caught myself putting my hands up to close my ears when psychopath was on the line.  This movie is very disturbing and very believable.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Amazing fighting scenes, Snipes acting as good as ever, fast-paced action (but in accord to the screenplay adn the characters possibilities, not stupid nor absurd like so many other action movies, good supporting cast, god cinematography, good special effects, good plot.<br />I never read any Blade comic book or history, but I enjoyed every second of this and the first one. It´s a sure bet: you´ll have fun.
B000001Y79|5.0|From start to finish this one of the most important albums of the 1990s. Even when I listen to this CD today I realize how ahead of its time it is. The songs have much more than music in it and Gwen rules!

B000000WF0|5.0|What is it about Manchester, or as some would better refer to as Madchester, that some of the best indie bands are borne out from that cold bleak urban milieu? It seems there's an air of decadence and uncertainty that surrounds the place which forces its denizens to go into music catharsis. That seems to be the case with The Verve's new album 'Urban Hymns', which is a bona fide, rock-induced apotheosis, and a soul-searching music journey. Richard Ashcroft, frontman of The Verve, proves yet again why he is at the top of his game, alongside Manchester's other big guns, Oasis and The Stone Roses. Displaying his sense of life around him, Ashcroft is maturing up to life judging from his lyrics. His songs of life, drugs and lived experiences, is painful to the point of self-destruction. In Drugs Don't Work, he sings: But I know I'm on a losing streak/Cause I passed down my old street/And if you wanna show, then just let me know/And I'll sing in your ear again. Ashcroft's familiar drones, accompanied by Nick McCabe's screechy and psychedelic riffs, are very much stirring and poignant all at the same time. While other tracks like The Rolling People and Catching that Butterfly display the transience for those caught between alternating state-of-minds, Ashcroft writes of the leave-it-be attitudes of the drug-induced lot. Urban Hymns is truly a work of art largely by Ashcroft, but not without the rest of the band for thanks to them, indie-rock has yet revived and is still very much alive.
0156907399|1.0|I found this book to be virtually unreadable. Rather than offering insight into the characters, it consist of merely words with no meaning, form or function.  If you want stream of conscious stick to &quot;Ulysees&quot; or work you way through &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. When you finish Joyce, you know you have improved your insight of humanity and have been amused on the way. After reading &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;, all I did was regret the time  reading it that could have been put to better purpose. When I finished this book, I had to read some Henry Miller and Louis Celine to clear my head. I put this  and Henry Green's &quot;Loving&quot; together as not really books, but merely the stringing together of many words.
6300215717|4.0|An excellent USA/FOREIGN film with the beauty of Audrey Hepburn and the Vespa rolled up into one! My 6 year old loves this movie....(1) because there's a princess and (2) the Vespa. Something to be said. Carefree and accountable 60's at it's best! PS..My girls bought me a vintage Vespa for my 50th birthday! Viva Vespa!
B00005YTFG|5.0|I thought the Moulin Rouge was really, really good ! The reason I gave it 5 stars was 'cause the acting was amazing and i really liked the songs. The end is to sad though and it annoys me how everything doesnt work out like it should in movies ;-).

B000000OAH|5.0|I've been reading some of the reviews on Amazon and I'm a little perplexed. To me, there a so many good songs on this album, I'm a little surprised that any of the reviews are negative.<BR>On this album, you've got \\"Don't stop me now\\", surely one of the best songs Freddie ever wrote. Then there's \\"Fat Bottom Girls\\", sexixt maybe but who cares when its such a super song.<BR>Then there's \\"Leaving home ain't easy\\" and \\"In only seven days\\" which are beautiful songs with plenty of feeling.<BR>There are good rockers too. \\"Let me entertain you\\" and \\"Leave on time\\" are just great. Then there's the clever but strange \\"Mustapha\\" and the funky \\"Fun It\\" which also hits the spot (not normally my cup of tea at all}. <BR>I remember when I first listened to this album. I didn't like it much. But then oh boy!. Maybe this is why such a surprising number of people wrote negative reviews. Or maybe some people don't like (or can't handle) the wide variety of musical styles that are on the album. For me, this album belongs in the top 6 that Queen have produced, along with \\"A Nght at the Opera\\", \\"Innuendo\\", \\"Queen 2\\" \\"News of the World\\" and \\"Flash Gordon\\". I might even be able to push it into the top 4, but I don't really think its necessary.<BR>Queen have produced some super albums and this is definitely one of them. I think most of you who are considering purchasing this album will absolutely love it!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is great movie for the family, it has a wonderful soundtrack as well.
B00007L7FN|5.0|\\"Atem\\" was Tangerine Dream's fourth album, released in 1973. In many ways, it marks the group's furthest departure from the world of rock and pop and the closest they ever came to the sound world of the classical avant garde. It is interesting to note that, for the first time, no guest musicians are credited, suggesting that the group of Edgar Froese, Chris Franke and Peter Baumann was settling down to working together and becoming more confident of their sound world.<br />The opening title track, 'Atem' (the German word for 'breath') clearly builds upon earlier TD material, like 'Alpha Centauri' and 'Zeit', being similar both in scale - it is over 20 minutes long - and style. In many ways, it is an updating of \\"Electronic Meditation\\", with Chris Franke's tom-tom drumming providing the main impetus over mostly organ and synth sounds in its early parts, and for its almost organic overtones. Present for the first time, though, is the distinctive sound of the mellotron, which was to become so much a Tangerine Dream trademark throughout the mid- to late-70s. 'Atem' is a beautifully structured work and has an exquisite central section, with a quiet heartbeat pattern played on tom toms, over an eerie mellotron loop and some beautifully textured patterns of white noise and, later, throbbing VCS3 sounds. At this point, TD comes close to the sound world of the electroacoustic musicians, especially of the French Canadian acousmatic school.<br />The next track, 'Fauni-Gena' is another largish work (almost 11 mins) which continues in a similar vein. The sound world here is suggestive of the primitive rainforest, with, once more, a haunting mellotron loop over the sounds of exotic birds and other creatures (whether real or synthesised is never obvious) carrying the listener's imagination off to far away times and places. Once more, it is highly redolent of the acousmatic school of composition.<br />'Circulation of Events' is another typical early TD meditative piece, featuring sustained organ and synthesiser notes over a rising VCS3 pulse. The final track, 'Wahn' (another German title: this one means 'delusion' - in the sense of that which gives rise to insanity!) is unique in the Tangerine Dream canon, however, in consisting of little beyond vocal utterings (grunts, mutterings, screams, shouts and so on) echoed and reverbed, before a rising percussion line restores some semblance of decorum and a gentle mellotron theme sings the work to a close. This is a track owing more to Ligeti's 'Aventures' and 'Nouvelles Aventures' and works of that ilk, than to anything from the rock or pop world. Perhaps the closest you can get to this nowadays would be Trevor Wishart's 'Vox cycle'.<br />This CD is a (1996) remastered release from original master tapes by TD's own Eastgate studio, so is probably as definitive a release as could be achieved. Its analogue origins remain apparent throughout, however, with tape hiss being quite prevalent, especially through the quieter passages, of which this disc has plenty. This needn't put you off, though, as the material more than makes up for these technical shortcomings, and I'm happy to report that the release is free of any particularly disturbing remastering artefacts. Although its 40 minute total playing time is less than generous by CD standards, this was typical of its day and this disc remains highly recommended to anyone wanting to explore the realm of early Tangerine Dream, or other works out of the mainstream of 1970's pop.sustained organ and synthesiser notes over a rising VCS3 pulse.

B00000G3PA|5.0|It is a great movie indeed - story, actors, images, sound, everything is perfect. Everybody is so proud of this family who does so much to save the world ; the father decides to sacrifice his life and gets a lots of positive support from his daughter, who litterally surrounds him with love. Just before making his decision, he informs his daughter, and sends her a last kiss over the video link. She is so proud of him but cannot avoid a few tears. It is very moving, and an exemple of commitment and absolute love.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand By Me has always been one of my all-time favorite movies. The chemistry between the four boys out to find the body of a kid their age has always been an inspiration for me growing up.<br />Rob Reiner's direction is tops. How he managed to get those four boys to act their hearts out is still a mystery today. The best comes out of River Phoenix as the troubled leader of the pack Chris Chambers, and Jerry O' Connell's part as the way-too-innocent scaredy cat Vern Tessio, Corey Feldman's turn as the crazy Teddy Duchamp, and Will Wheaton as the narrator of the story, the more focused than the others Gordon Lachance. Cameos by Richard Dreyfuss as the older Gordon, and John Cusack as Gordon's deceased brother Denny add an overwhelming feeling of delight to the entirety of this magnificent movie.<br />Special features include a behind the scenes of the film plus interviews with nearly the entire cast, a tribute to River Phoenix, Ben E King's music video of the theme song Stand By Me  and commentary by director Rob Reiner.<br />This is one of those movies that no matter how many times you've seen it, you don't get bored of watching again.<br />Highly Recommended
0812550706|5.0|Andrew (Ender) Wiggin is a Third, a third child to his parents. Population restrictions forbid this, but Ender is special. Battle School needs him, so they allowed his parents to have him. Born into the world with his hateful older brother Peter Wiggin, who always seems to hate him. To see the worst that isn't there, to manipulate everything Ender and everyone does against them. And to his loving and caring sister Valentine, who protects him. Who cherishes his very existence. But Ender is a mix, a mix of the compassion of his sister, and the brutality of his brother. His siblings are geniuses, as is he. He has had a monitor on for all six years of his life, the monitor that records every single thing he does, how he feels, everything about him. Until one day it is taken out, and he must face the other children of his school not only as a Third, but also as a failure. Then, after a fight, he is taken. Taken to Battle School, a Space Station in space, training geniuses and children to be Battle Commanders, the Formic Wars are not over, Buggers (Bug-like Aliens) have attacked twice before, and the human race must be prepared for the third attack. Or will there be another? Them or us is the motto. And the IF (International Fleet) is not expecting to lose. Ender is brought up at Battle School as the best, he is the best. He has the brains, the leadership, and the ability to command. Can he overcome the Buggers, and if he does, will it be the right thing? <br />When I first read Ender's Game, it was by recommendation by a friend. I didn't have a clue as to how it would be so great. Orson Scott Card captures the reader's attention in this thrilling science fiction book. Since that first time I read Ender's Game I must've read it a dozen times more, and bought some of the sequels. Yes, Card doesn't leave you dangling wanting more, he follows Ender with Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind. And while he does this he has also written the happenings of Ender's origin in books such as Ender's Shadow, Shadow of the Hegemony, Shadow Puppets. A lot of Shadows, but a lot of good time spent reading. So try this book out, if you like science fiction, this is a perfect book for you.
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite for destruction....need to say more? this album is to me the greatest ever,if you are a rock fan and don't have it...go get it! every single song is a hit guaranteed to blow your mind away and make you come back for more. From the opening chords in &quot;welcome to the jungle&quot; through the high energy &quot;paradise city&quot; and ending with an emotional outro in &quot;rocket queen&quot;,this album has everything you need, everything rock is: energy,anger,emotions,love etc....
B00005YXZH|5.0|Transcends any genre and leaves you asking 'Why am I obsessed with this album?'. The answer is that the wonderful sounds are engaging, challenging and at times tearjerking. I have had this in heavy rotation for weeks now. I move it from my car, to my stereo, to my computer at work. And I still can't put my finger on the mesmerizing quality that has been achieved. I'm heavily into the Uncle Tupelo, Whiskeytown, Wilco 'Being There' vibe and strangely, YHT fits right in??? Beyond its musical greatness, buy it to experience modern music that is beyond categorization.
B00005JKL8|5.0|Wow! is this a thrill ride or what.  The disclaimer at the beginning of the movie made me sit up and pay attention, because I knew the movie was on to a sensitive subject.  The action sceens were fantastic.  The SAMs chase of the Navy jet was awesome.  The flight for home was a good mixture of reality and a little fantasy help from Hollywood but you are sure to be entertained by this hard hitting gritty action movie.  It's parallel to past situations in western Europe make for a great hero movie.  After you see this movie you will want to start it over from the begining.  Great stuff!!!...
6305949980|5.0|If you haven't seen it yet, you are missing the only film in it's genre.  There isn't anything else like it.  This is one of my all-time favorites, and my two year old daughter's as well.  Truly a movie for all ages.  I absolutely love Danny Elfman's songs in this film - haunting, yet empathic.  This movie is not as boisterous as Beetlejuice, but is more subtle in it's message, like Edward Scissorhands.  Kids will love the fun characters and music; as an adult I love the artistic rendering that has been given to the set, characters, and music.  Where stop-motion animation is concerned, it is, technically, by far the best ever made to date.  The movement is very fluid, not at all like the Christmas classics I grew up with.  I am surprised by how many people I have met who have never seen this movie- in our household, it is not only a semi-annual tradition (shown on both Hallowe'en and Christmas) but is also a day-to-day favorite, good for viewing anytime you want to watch a fun film.  This DVD edition contains more worthwhile extras than almost any other DVD I've ever owned, including great short films, documentaries and commentaries.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I am a long time fan of the web head and was not sure if the movie would do the long time comic hero justice but it did in a huge way.  The special effects are almost unbelievable.  The characters are cast with great care and the main character, the web slinger (Tobey Maguire)does the part justice.  The movie starts out slowly building the characters and half of the way through the movie you will want to restart it again.  If you are a fan of Spiderman or if not you will want to get this on DVD and VHS.  No collection is complete without this one.
B00005OAIE|5.0|If you think this album is for teenyboppers, than you obviously haven't heard him live, and/or heard any of his other songs.  The true John you can find when you see him in concert, but for now buy this cozy album.  He is so witty and charming with his lyrics, and the way he sings that you will smile frequently throughout the whole cd.
B000002UAU|5.0|Yes, this record has been written about ad nauseum. I'm sure you could venture deep into the Amazon forest, find an untouched, undiscovered tribe of natives who have never seen the outside world, yet would still be able to hum most of these songs.<BR>Succinctly put, there is no other \\"classic\\" album that is just so much dang fun to listen to.
B000035P7S|4.0|Very enjoyable film with good acting.  Is portrayal of conditions in postwar Japan accurate?  Is this really what went down, how people acted then?  Was the U.S. Army really this involved in the soldiers' private lives?  Were whites really this prejudiced?  Were Japanese women really that submissive? What did Japanese audiences think at the time this film was released?  It was probably a very enlightened film for its time and earnestly made a case for overcoming the racism portrayed by Americans here.  The women look absolutely gorgeous in their makeup and theatrical costumes.  Does anyone know if there really is a 'Matsubayashi' theatrical troupe as shown in the movie?
B000066NW0|4.0|I thought the music was good, and the song styles. I love Avril's vocals and her vocal syle on the songs. I just felt the lyrics were still alittle immature. Some of the lyrics felt like the same thing over and over again. I do think she is a musical artist that will be popular for a while. I will definately pick up her next CD to see how she progresses with her music.
0375414053|2.0|Being a working mom who constantly feels guilty about said work, the title of Pearson's novel caught my attention.  But I was disappointed to find I couldn't relate to Kate at all and it was a long slow read on the stair stepper.  The only reason I kept at it is because I don't like to leave anything unfinished.  In the story, Kate always puts her job first.  I've made it clear in my place of employment that I have higher commitments, my family; and I have no intention of traveling or staying for late meetings.  I give my all when I'm in the office, but don't impose on my personal time.  That said, I'll say I didn't feel sorry for Kate.  I would love not having to work.  I would love it if I felt I had a choice, but as one reviewer put it, I work so my child can live in a nice house, a good, safe neighborhood, so I can send him to college when the time comes.  I think the story would be more interesting if the main character was a mom who HAD to work.  That's more realistic.  That would be someone I could empathize.  There were a few (very few) chuckles, but overall, I did not enjoy this read.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I am really enjoying alot of the new rock music that is coming out. Is This It deserves all the hype and great reviews it is getting. The sound is great, the songs well written. A great rock CD.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This CD is worth buying. I was just buying it for &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; but when I listened to the rest of the CD, I fell in love with it. It sounds great. T.A.T.U. is a great group, hope they make it over here in the U.S., if they don't, we are really missing out on real talent. I think it's pretty cool that they are a couple, and a singing couple at that. I have no problems with it. Number 12 of the CD is wonderful, you get the Video, and Behind the Scenes Part 2. (What happen to part 1?) Also, I think it's pretty cool they added the Russian version of &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; (number 9), and &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; (number 10) to the CD. In my opinion, this is a great CD, so go out, get it. You will NOT be disappointed! <br />P.S. If you have a Dolby Digital Surround Sound Home Theatre System, it's really awesome on there if you play it on there.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Have seen this movie twice, will go to see it again, can't wait until the DVD comes out. When it does, I'll probably buy two copies because I'll wear the first one out watching it over and over. ... The soundtrack of the movie will provide my 'fix' until the DVD comes out.  I listened to friend's copy and ordered it right away. Ignore the last two tracks though, they're junk. I highly recommend this CD.
B00005B5L4|5.0|Listening to this classic album in glorious 5.1 surround makes me very glad I bought a DVD Audio player.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I prefer 'The Two Towers' score over this one, but I may be biased because I bought that one first. However, I just had to have this one after watching 'Fellowship' *again.* This one has much more action-oriented music, but it also has probably the most beautiful piece of all the tracks on both cd's, the theme for Aragorn and Arwen featured in 'The Council of Elrond.' Enya truly has a surrealistically angelic voice. <br />'Lothlorien' is heavenly and I tend to keep it on repeat while I'm writing. The boy's choir that sings on the cd is incredibly talented; my favorite moments in the music has them singing on 'A Knife in the Dark', brief as it may be. <br />I don't often sit to just listen to music as I would sit and watch TV, so I will say that this is the kind of music that give chores and cooking dinner a sense of enjoyment when otherwise you would be veddy bored. You can remember the movie by this music, and be put into that nice, other-worldly place while you dice the chicken or rake the leaves. :-) <br />I always keep my portable cd player handy and the Lord of the Rings scores have been playing on my headphones nearly every day since I bought each of them. As a side note, the cd cases are decorated quite beautifully, as well as the cds themselves. I do tend to download some music when I know the rest of the cd is nothing special, but I wouldn't dream of doing that with any score, let alone this one (and TTT). It's a complete package for any moviemusic lover with a soft spot for the LOTR; you can definetly buy it with confidence.
B00005O3VC|5.0|The film has never looked better.  It looks much sharper and more like a proper film than it did on old VHS issues and television broadcasts.<br />For those not familiar with this classic film, it is a wildly imaginative, hilarious satire on the nature of chivalry and the dark ages.  Few films have been as brilliantly written as this and the troupe's \\"Life of Brian\\".  Actually, no films.  (That's a Monty Python reference right there).  It's not everyone's cup of tea; religion is put in its place, and there is bloodshed and sexual material present.<br />The extras are very nice, especially the BBC \\"Film Night\\" footage and a new segment with Palin and Jones revisiting the castle site on which the movie was filmed.  The extra audio track with Cleese, Palin, and Idle is amusing and interesting, definitely something that fans will want to hear.  The audio track with the two directors (Gilliam and Jones) predictably drags a bit by comparison.
0140177396|5.0|I'm not going to give you a summary of this story, as you'll find many on this page. I'll tell you this, though, buy this book in the store, they're overcharging for it here. And aside from that, this book *is* wonderful. I had to read the first chapter for school and read the rest on my own. The imagery is vivid and all of the characters, from the least important to the main two, Lennie and George, breathe a life of their own. Another good one by John Steinbeck is 'The Pearl.'
B000068OSK|5.0|If you own White Blood Cells and/or De Stijl, this is a CD you must get. It has 17 outstanding tracks which include my faviortes, Jimmy The Exploder, The Big Three Killed My Baby, Astro and I Fought Piranhas. This is DEFINATELY a CD to own!!
B00005JKPF|4.0|There are a lot of people waiting for this film and it will deliver, I can't wait to see Alan Cummings as Nightcrawler...the one thing most fans wanted though, was to see the film being made in Detroit.  Detroit, Michigan played a good part in the Cartoon, as the Sentinel home base.  They need to show 313 City in the X-MEN Movies.  After \\"8 Mile\\", Detroit has reinvented itself as a promotable Filming Location.  Why was Bobby (Iceman) from Boston?  Why can't he be from Detroit?
B000071ZZI|4.0|I didn't like the book. It was corny. How corny? Well, Iowa comes to mind. So I think the director was very wise to do a loose adaptation. Damon is terrific as Jason Bourne. Understated and fantastic in the action sequences. His German co-star is also excellent. It is a masterful piece of film making. Sure, it may may cross over from \\"film\\" to \\"movie\\" in places, but all in all it's a completey satisfying spy movie. Well shot. Well directed. Well edited. And marvelous sound design. In short, it rocked. Oh yeah, if you want something truer to the book, there is an earlier version of this movie starring the action movie staple Richard Chamberlain.  Sort of a secret agent meets \\"The Thornbirds\\" type deal, I guess.
B000002GGU|5.0|If you don't like rock and roll, don't bother with this album. For those of you who only know the later Bryan Adams (the guy who sang with Barbara Streisand and is a darling of the &quot;lite FM&quot; genre),this album may be a little shocking -- it is honest, straight up, occasionally guitar crunching rock and roll. All the promise of his earlier &quot;Cuts Like A Knife&quot; is fullfilled in this album. &quot;Ain't Gonna Cry&quot; is a terrific song for that significant other you were relieved to see go. &quot;It's Only Love&quot; features Tina Turner in all her soulful glory. &quot;Run to You&quot; is still a (cheating)classic, as are &quot;Somebody&quot; and &quot;Summer of 69&quot; (all of which still get regular airplay on rock radio). I first bought this on cassette in 1987, and once CD's became common, it was the first CD I ever bought. It's been many years since the release of these songs, but I put it on the other day, and it still stands up. Not only is this Bryan Adams' best album, but it's one of the most underrated albums of all time.
B000066NW0|5.0|I definitely enjoy good music. As a musician's girlfriend for about 6 years, I hauled a bass rig across the greater Chicagoland area and spent my weekends going to Dream Theater concerts. During this phase in life, I turned a deaf ear to what I thought of as \\"cheesy\\" music, including Britney, N'Synch, and other manufactured corporate pop designed to sell t-shirts & lunchboxes. I thought of myself as a wise, seasoned music aficionado. These days, however, I have begun to think about why I don't like cheese, and it's not necessarily because of the music. The real cheese I dislike is the stinky cheese - the kind that confuses kids and gives them the wrong idea about what it means to be strong, in love, an adult, popular, or whatever they are trying to be at the time. Avril proves that there is actually some great cheese out there ... she actually wears clothing that covers her body and gives a positive message to kids that they can be themselves, grounded, and appreciative of what life has to offer. Okay, her mall video is pretty lame, and no, she's not \\"punk,\\" but I doubt that being cool is the most important thing to Avril, and therein lies her beauty. Her lyrics are believable - their beauty is IN the fact that they sound like a 17 year-old girl wrote them. Now this is some sweet cheese.
B00006M183|3.0|While this album is several steps up from the hideous mess of &quot;Binaural&quot; (it features actual *songs*, for example, rather than an entire disc of unfocused meandering) it's still hampered by the murky, indistinct production values that the band has suffered from to one extent or another since &quot;Vitalogy&quot;: most of the time, most of the instruments sound like they were recorded with the speakers under a bale of cotton, particularly the drums and rhythm guitars. Overall, though, not bad, if you can get past the sound and focus on the songs themselves.
B00005JLS0|5.0|I am a sandra Bullock fan, I love her acting style, plus she is a beautiful person that shines through the movies she's been in. I got a good laugh out of this movie. It was well done by both actors. If you want to see a movie that will have you in stitches, then this is a great pick. I also recommend seeing this movie on a Sunday.
B00003CXP1|2.0|Sure, it's powerful. It's directed with style. Yes, someone made a watchable movie out of a Hubert Selby Jr. book. But \\"powerful\\" doesn't automatically equate with \\"great,\\" and 'Requiem for a Dream' doesn't even constitute a near-miss.    Darren Aronofsky may have all the talent in the world, but he still has yet to deliver a fully-realized film. For all of the evocative hopelessness in his work, he's too caught-up in his own \\"brilliance\\" to render well-drawn, deeply felt characters. As game as the efforts of his actors are - Jennifer Connelly deserves credit for the big chances she took - only Ellen Burstyn's performance suggests anything remotely like a real person. Jared Leto's Harry is a cipher. And to anyone who would argue that you don't need great characters to make great films, even a technician like Kubrick makes his performances paramount.    So yeah, it is visually stunning. The fast-cut editing style is pretty neat. But 'Requiem' hollows you out with its sheer manipulative force, rather than the strength of the drama on screen.     If you want bleak, desperate cinema where the manipulator gets great performances from his cast, check out 'Nil By Mouth,' 'Naked,' 'The Dreamlife of Angels,' 'Rosetta,' or 'The Life of Jesus.' This is the Hollywood version.
B000002KOQ|5.0|Fans of the free-spirited Joni Mitchell - a TRUE artist with a rather simple voice - will all want to have this CD in their collection.  It's one of the very best.  <br />As a work of art, it isn't actually as brilliantly constructed as BLUE.  But some of the individual songs are the best she's ever done.  And a couple of them are pretty famous.<br />FOR FREE is an incredible tribute to street musicians.  The modesty of the lyrics is quintessential Joni.  The words say plainly that &quot;successful&quot; musicians like herself aren't always any better than somebody who plays &quot;for free&quot;.  It's that earthy modesty, and gentle thoughtfulness toward others that often comes across in her lyrics and makes listening fans feel like best friends with this artist.  <br />WOODSTOCK is of course a very famous song.  So is THE CIRCLE GAME and BIG YELLOW TAXI.<br />But I particularly like CONVERSATION - the simple and feisty professions of a woman who's tired of the man she loves coming to her, asking advice about his current girlfriend.  When SHE wants to be his girlfriend!<br />This is a peppy album that folk-music-lovers can bop around to a little in the car.  It definitely has an upbeat tone, interrupted by only the occasional long, soft ballad like WOODSTOCK.  <br />It may be that serious fans will point to other albums as being cohesively more brilliant in some way.  But no one can deny that this is a &quot;must-have&quot; album and that some of the songs are among her very best.
B0000541AM|5.0|Are you kidding me? Is there anything better than this movie? <br />Easily one of the saddest career trajectories in American movies, Walter Hill probably peaked with this absolute gem of a gangland melodrama, cementing his place next to Sam Fuller in the pantheon of genre filmmakers who probably could've been contenders (ok, yeah he directed '48 hrs.' but look at everything that followed). In a lot of ways, we're exploring the same type of post-apocalyptic, pre-Rudy Giuliani, hyperdrive New York City that John Schlesinger explored in \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" and Martin Scorsese tackled in \\"Taxi Driver\\". Except WAY cheesier.<br />It's impossible to know what to like best in this film: Mercedes Ruehl as a skanky undercover cop? The Baseball Furies? The Lizzies? James Remar? The 'So-far-down-they-aren't-even-on-the-map' Orphans?<br />What's amazing is, for all the crazy, whacked-out, cheesy elements, it hangs together brilliantly, and the social commentary comes through loud and clear. The soundtrack and costumes also kick heinie.<br />But anyway, see this movie on DVD, even if the transfer doesn't do it any justice. Sure, you've watched it a million times on WPIX or TNT, but c'mon, it's all commercials where the good stuff should be. This film, more than \\"Beat Street,\\" \\"Saturday Night Fever,\\" \\"Krush Groove\\" or any other New York movie, makes me miss the nastier, messier NYC of the 70s & 80s.<br />See it now, before Tony Scott sinks his teeth into it and casts Vin Diesel as Cochise.
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell is the kind of brilliant artist who needs repeated listenings.  Not everyone loves her the first time they hear her.  Coming into her fresh, there are some people who find her voice a little flat, her melodies distractingly complex, and her lyrics a strange combination of earthy and abstract.  <br />If you're one of those people - don't give up!<br />Becoming a Joni Mitchell fan is sometimes a gradual experience, but it's a highly rewarding one.  Some people love her simple high notes and her interesting lyrics from the very start.  But other people must grow to love Joni.  They'll listen to an album several times, then suddenly, they'll &quot;get it&quot;, and all of her albums will suddenly become jewels in their eyes.<br />What Joni expresses in her albums is the lifestyle and attitude of someone who is completely free-spirited, and yet, still has human anxieties and uncertainties.  Every song - no matter what the specific topic - is fundamentally about that theme.  Every love song is sung from the point of view of someone who is simultaneously vulnerable and free.  Every road song is about someone who longs both for the wind in her hair ... and the comfort of a home.  <br />Her delivery is plain - like a friend's delivery.  But she sings with her whole heart.  And once her meandering words weave their way into your spectrum of understanding ... her songs become buddies you can't live without.  <br />She's honest.  She speaks plainly and puts her emotions right out there.  She's free as the wind.  She's vulnerable as a pup.  She's wise as a tree.  And she's gentle as water.<br />BLUE should be the first album you learn to love.
B0000844IT|5.0|Just when you thought it was safe, good old Anchor Bay DVD has released yet again, another edition of ARMY OF DARKNESS. Many would say \\"what are you people thinking?!\\" while I would say \\"bring it on!\\" ARMY OF DARKNESS has got to be one of my favorite films of all time and I cant wait to get this new edition! For all you newcomers to the series, this a perfect edition to buy because it has practically every special feature possible! It includes both the theatrical and director's cut versions which I have been waiting for since forever! I'm not going to get into the plot because I dont want to spoil anything for all you newcomers out there! To sum it up, this is an awesome movie full of laughs, scares, ultra cheap special effects and best of all Bruce \\"Dont call me Ash\\" Campbell! Catch ya later!
0060090367|1.0|I have to admit to not being much of a Marian Keyes fan.  I hated \\"Lucy Sullivan\\" but did like \\"Last Chance Saloon\\" and thought I would give Keyes another try.  So I bought this book.  Over a week ago.  And still haven't finished it (not even close).  I just can't.  To begin with, I found Claire's sudden lust for Adam a bit untimely.  Having been through a sudden and very nasty breakup myself, and not having been able to function properly for months afterward, let alone even CONSIDER hooking up with someone else, I found it a bit of a stretch to believe that Claire would go from throwing things/temper tantrums, etc. to infatuation with her sister's friend in only one month.  Especially in light of Claire's supposed deep love for her husband.  Not only that, but that she made only one attempt to contact her husband during that time.  But what REALLY got to me was this line:  Claire has handed her daughter, Kate (1 month old) over to Adam and thinks to herself that, because Kate is in his arms, that she is one \\"lucky b***h.\\"  Who in their right minds would think anything of the sort about an infant... especially her own daughter?  I got to that point, closed the book, and walked away.<br />There were also some rather obvious editing errors (Claire carries on about how she is broke, then she goes to her bank - which is rather odd considering that she LIVES in England, yet her bank account is in Ireland?  Doesn't make sense.  Also, if she was broke, how was she able to get money from said bank?) that were somewhat grating, but would be overlooked in a better novel.  I realize this was Keyes' first book, but those \\"zippy\\" one liners made Claire seem crass rather than spunky or funny and I found Claire's supposed \\"zaniness\\" off kilter.  Her husband seemed such a stuffed shirt.  Why would he cheerfully bail her out without going ballistic about having to do so?  Basically, I was unable to get a feel for their relationship; it simply didn't make sense.  His departure is sudden and seemingly completely out of character and Claire's friends are all aware of the affair, but don't tell her (what kind of friends are they, anyway?)??????<br />I've pretty much lost any enthusiasm I might have had for these single-women/Brit Chix books, but I have definitely lost the very little respect I had for Ms. Keyes' writing abilities.
B0000797IO|4.0|I think we've gotten so used to Jennifer Aniston playing Rachel Green on \\"Friends\\" that many people didn't give \\"The Good Girl\\" a chance when it was released. Big mistake, because Aniston is remarkable. As Justine Last, a bored employee at the Retail Rodeo, Aniston is simply remarkable, embracing the spirit of a small town girl in all its glory. As her depressed lover, Jake Gyllenhaal is also good, making us root for him while at the same time asking, \\"what is the matter with him?\\" Writer Mike White's script is thoughtful and full of sharp dialogue, and director Miguel Artera keeps the story flowing while allowing the actors to fully develop their characters. For everyone involved- WELL DONE!!!
B000001FS3|2.0|I know there were a zillion copies of this album sold over the years, but I just can't get into it. I like the first 3 tracks (which were all hits) but the rest of the album leaves me cold. That leaves me in the minority I'm sure but c'est la vie.
0671004107|5.0|Carl Sagan should have written more fiction, as this is one of the best written and most intelligent books in the genre. The characters are fascinating, the human element of the story truly inspiring, the conclusion radical and eye-opening and it's written on a level anyone can understand. <br />Sagan's writing conceptualizes science without sacrificing an enjoyable story. Open minded readers will appreciate the symbolism and irony absent in the film version as skeptics becomes believers and the tables turn on the debate between science and religion. <br />You won't be disappointed. The ending in &quot;Contact&quot; is the most surprising and satisfying that I've ever read. It really gets you thinking about the universe, it's origin and our place in it.
B00005JLSC|5.0|If you want to leave a theater happily tapping your feet, singing a song, and yearning for the age of the big-screen musical, go see \\"Chicago.\\"  This high energy romp has outstanding choreography, cinematography, costuming, and all that jazz.  But most surprising of all, this movie has three well-known actors previously unknown to me for their singing and dancing talents that literally filled the theater with energy and enthusiasm.<br />Two big thumbs up to Richard Gere (who knew he could sing and tap-dance?) Renee Zellweger, and Catherine Zeta-Jones who turn in admirable performances.  From the opening sequence when Zeta-Jones belts out \\"All That Jazz\\" you will be overwhelmed by the sheer intensity and downright fun of this film.  There are so many highlights and unforgettable moments, but my favorites in addition to the Zeta-Jones opener were Gere's \\"Razzle Dazzle,\\" John C. Reilly's \\"Mister Cellophane,\\" Queen Latifah's \\"When You're Good to Mama,\\" and every moment Renee Zellweger was on screen, especially her show-stopping marionette duo with Gere, \\"We Both Reached for the Gun.\\"<br />Not only will I buy the DVD, but I will see this one again in theaters.  That's high praise for a movie that was third on my list to see, but I bought the ticket only because the other two were sold out the day I went.  Go see this one and hope Hollywood decides to give us more of this caliber.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|If you base the contributions of Bob Dylan's music on record sales then he would fall far short of the pack. Dylan is without a doubt a gift of incredible sensitivity and talent. Love and Theft is an album that falls in with Dylan's best; \\"Blonde on Blonde,\\" \\"Highway 61,\\" \\"Nashville Skyline\\" (yes, Nashville Skyline), \\"The Basement Tapes,\\" \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" \\"The Freewheelin'...\\" and the list includes several others, and none of them are the same. They are a continual evolution of a creative genius, whether in the studio or on the stage. Bob Dylan is a gift and like most gifts, they are never fully realized until they are gone. Love and Theft is an album worth placing next to your most prized recordings. Listen to it from the perspective of the times, not from the perspective of past time. Thank-you Mr. Dylan.
B000071ZZI|5.0|Great movie . . . good actors . . . love the European feel to the movie and Matt Damon actually comes across as sexy.  I really enjoyed the movie, although I had a real dislike for the book when I tried reading it after having seen the movie.<br />It's probably best not to try to compare the two.  They're just too different.
B00006ZSAD|5.0|I agree with a friend who calls Portishead \\"musical wallpaper;\\" it can help complete a nice room, but it will never be front and center. Not so with Beth Gibbons' extraordinary solo debut. Its quiet hush has a startling ability to grab you and not let go; you have to go as far back as Nick Drake to find an artist who achieves this level of intensity with such a quiet and subdued presence. Especially impressive is the range of styles and moods Out of Season achieves working within a modest sonic (i.e. spare) and emtional (i.e. sorrowful) framework. Tasty arrangements from Talk Talk's Paul Webb give the album a wonderfully modulated flow, but Gibbons' chameleon vocals are what make it so compelling. How often have flavor-of-the-week singers been compared to Billie or Dusty or some other forbearer from a golden age gone? Gibbons' performance on Out of Season is the first I've heard in a long time that can withstand such comparisons, largely because Gibbons uses her voice and talent with intelligence in service to the material. I literally gasped when I first heard the world-weary jazz vocalist she channels on \\"Romance.\\" She also achieves another clich music biz journalists love to spout - the intensity of her private reverie will convince you that she's singing into your ear. We've heard these claims time and time again.  On the haunting beauty that is Out of Season, however, Gibbons delivers.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|Wow !! This movie is awesome. The Director improves his work from Pi to this one.... I love the way he tells the story by gently pulling you into this world of chaos in such a way that you don't even realize what has overtaken you.  He takes you into the world of these four characters and lets you see and feel things like they do. ...this movie is unstoppable.
B000001Y79|5.0|No Doubt's best cd. All before they compromised their sound for record sales. That is in the past though and this is one of the best cds of the 90's. A good buy if you're into the ska/punk sound.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is definitely one of the best albums ever in any genre of music. As for the \\"rock-rap\\" label that has been bestowed on Rage,forget it. [Other] bands like Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach simply cannot and will not ever compare to RATM. The guitars, bass, and drums on this record are absolutely phenomenal. As with all of RATM's records, I highly recommend you buy this record if you are a fan of hard rock. This is one of the rare albums that has the power to get you instantly pumped. A Classic!!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|Some may argue that with Lateralus, Tool sold out with its somewhat softer sound and no swearing. This album at its core still has the same good old opening riffs as their previous albums. Lateralus is also a more spiritual journey through the songs with little stopping time if any between tracks. This is an excellent CD and a must have for all Tool and progressive rock fans alike.
B00005LOUP|3.0|This edition of the Grinch is good. Nicely done by Jim Carey. Though, understanding him is not the easiest. You may need to turn on the subtitles the first time you watch it. In my opinion, stick with the original cartoon.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Top Secret is the funniest movies that I have ever seen. I laughed from the opening scene right through to the end. Val Kilmer plays the hero in this slapstick comedy and plays one of his best roles ever. Be sure not to miss the stand off in the hide away as it is one of the greatest fight scenes I have ever seen. . <BR>Watchout for all the side gags and the bad, corney jokes that make this movie flow like no comedy has before. <BR>If you don't laugh from the start to the end then save up yopur money so you can go and buy a sense of humor, as you will be hard pressed to find a funnier movie.
0380729407|3.0|I have taken two stars off my rating because I felt the ending was very rushed.  I would have liked to know more about the Illustrated Man, aka Mr. Dark, who was the most fascinating character in the novel.  Also, I don't know if I liked Mr. Bradbury's style of writing for this novel - there were sections where I couldn't follow the imagery and wasn't connecting to what he was talking about.  Otherwise, a very enjoyable, fast paced, thriller/horror story from Mr. Bradbury.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I cant say enough about John Mayer. His voice is a perfect blend of &quot;smooth raspiness&quot;, filled with soul. His lyrics actually make you THINK about life and love, they always make sense and u can adapt them to your own experiences. instead of the stupid &quot;baby i love you baby&quot; teeny bopper types. His guitar skills are amazing too, i dont really see the similarities with dave matthews though, theyre different styles of music. If you're a fan of Real talent filled music- you'll love John. He is absolutely amazing. thanks so much for letting us hear your awesome talent John! &lt;3
0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is best known for its unforgettable score and infamous shower scene which at the time of its release the most graphic murder scene ever filmed.  But Psycho is so much than just a slasher film.  It is an intensely compelling psychological thriller that draws you in with its riveting plot and first rate acting.  Anthony Perkins is requisitely creepy as motel owner Norman Bates, but he adds so much more to the character.  What could have been just a one-dimensional role, Mr. Perkins approaches it with depth and makes you wonder how Norman became the man he was. Janet Leigh is striking as Marion Crane who decides to steal $40,000.00 and ends up meeting her doom at the Bates Motel.  Vera Miles, John Gavin and the great Martin Balsam all provide tremendous support.  Psycho set the standard by which all subsequent horror films are to be judged.
B0000844IT|5.0|For the sake of clarity, I just want to say that there is no way I could review any version of Army of Darkness without giving it five stars. It is a modern classic which I can watch over and over again. Seeing the Tiny Evil Ashes take on Ash causes me to laugh out loud with every \\"My fair lady.\\"<br />Having said that, I can't imagine why they are releasing yet another SE DVD set of it. I own the 2-disc Limited Edition which came out a few years ago. I can't find anything different about this new \\"Boomstick Edition\\" that isn't on the old Limited Edition. Both have the original theatrical release and the director's cut with 15 additional minutes of footage. Both have the Men Behind The Army featurette. Both have the Raimi, Campbell, Raimi commentary. The only thing I've noticed so far is that the Boomstick edition comes with some kind of 10 page collectible book which my LE set didn't have. But unless they made some drastic changes to either the video or audio to clear up imperfections which I never noticed in the first place, I couldn't justify buying this new edition. But if you don't yet own Army of Darkness, don't be a primitive screwhead. Click on the Buy It Now link and get it.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Rear Window has a simple plot, an injured photographer becomes intrigued and enraptured with the comings and goings of his neighbors across the courtyard in his apartment complex and becomes convinced that one neighbor has murdered his wife.  The film takes place exclusively in the photographer's apartment and we merely can see into the neighbor's apartments through their windows.  The photographer, Jeff Jeffries, is played by James Stewart and due his broken leg is confined to his apartment and due to the inherent voyeuristic nature of his trade, he trains his eye on the apartments across the courtyard.  Grace Kelly plays his girlfriend, Lisa, and she is at first disinterested and disapproving of his actions, but she too is soon drawn into the human drama.  Thelma Ritter plays her usual sarcastic role as a visiting nurse who is sucked into Jeff's human drama.  Mr. Hitchcock does a brilliant job of making Jeff's voyeurism at first seem comically, a fun way to kill idle time, then slowly building upon a suspicion that grows and grows until it reaches a scary and thrilling conclusion.  The fact that he only allows the audience to see things from the perspective of Jeff's apartment and never allows into the apartments across the courtyard is a brilliant piece of direction and adds to the tension.  Rear Window was the second of the films that Mr. Hitchcock and Mr. Stewart made together and it was rousing success after the disappointment both felt after their first collaboration, 1948's Rope.
B00006LHYC|5.0|Laura Pausini is one of those rarely performers (not singers) who do everything they commit themselves to do with supreme excellence. She is now beyong the singing scene, she is an absolute performer. All the stars for her and this new and wonderful album... You would never regret buying it.
B00005M989|1.0|Why? Prince's music is something that needs to be accumulated, and listened to over time. A quick dose of his hits in no way will satisfy any music-loving soul. This album, besides being released by WB without any Prince involvement whatsoever, was also a slap in the face in that there is ALREADY a greatest hits album out there! With not one, not two, but three volumes to it! If you want a greatest hits collection, The Hits 1, 2, and 3 are paramount. And not only that, but the liner notes to The Hits are actually worth reading! <br />Basically this was just a thrown off by WB to make money off Prince and its release strategically coincided with Prince's Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic release in 1999. And I am NOT one of those fans who blames WB for every bad thing that has happened to Prince in the last decade.<br />This is fast food. Spend the extra money and get the gourmet Prince!
6304696566|1.0|A fantastic movie and a true classic - and certainly one that really shines when presented in its true widescreen aspect ratio.  That said, SHAME on Warner Brothers for butchering this issue with a \\"imitation\\" widescreen format (hence my 1-star rating).  The packaging claims both Standard format and \\"matted\\" widescreen are on the dvd - the latter (at least for WB) means that they take the (already width-cropped) standard screen version and simply [take] huge strips off of the top and bottom of the picture to make the shape approximately 1:85:1 (so an HDTV format screen is filled, no doubt).  The result is that when watching this \\"widescreen\\" version, one is seeing far less picture than even in the Standard format!  I have verified this by comparing the two dvd sides (one standard, the other \\"widescreen\\") to one another and to a true widescreen tape that I have.  Those reviewers that have been raving about this widescreen presentation, have a look at the standard format side of the disk to see more of the movie ;-)
B000002N1E|4.0|That is how I would describe this album. For some reason known only to Warner Brothers, this album is now out of print but among diehard Prince fans it's hailed as one of the best. Even those who are too musically impaired to recognize Prince's genius would HAVE to admit that this is an explosive album. We are talking raw funk and a whole lot of rock. The album flies by, and only lags on the song We March, which should have been left off. Yet this does not in any way spoil the fast pace of this album. The famous The Most Beautiful Girl In The World is on this album but be careful-- the single you heard on the radio back in 1996 is not the one presented here. This version has more of a live vibe, but with the exact same vocals as the single.<br />Someone here reviewed 319 as being .... Hardly! 319 is funny and uptempo, and again, hard rocking.<br />How does Prince retain such strong melodies yet still rock out? The only way to know is to buy this album. Do it because it is out of print--once it's gone, it's gone.<br />PRINCE IS NOT DEAD!
B00006RIO7|4.0|While i can completely appreciate the hard work that went into this, i cannot help but feel that all of the vocal performances could have been better, had the actors been given more time and training.  The vocal style of choice for most of the females is brassy and nasal- a style that is currently very popular on Broadway. Queen Latifah is the exeption, with an actual belt and support to her instrument not evidenced by Zellweiger and Zeta-Jones. Too bad, but a game try, gals! The males in the cast do justice to the songs, with a noticeable absence of that overly-nasal quality. Well done, boys. The chorus sounds spirited and game, and since many of them are my friends, i absolutely must recommend this cd!
B00005QK3W|5.0|Every song on this album is spectacular.  Excellent basslines, some of the best ever seen on any Paul album.  The lyrics, as simple as some of them were, they were all good.  I loved Riding To Jaipur, the sitar sound was a great addition to the album.  With the sitar on Jaipur and rap sound on Spinning on an Axis, Paul really showed what a mulittalented musician he is.  This is definitely one of my favorite Macca albums!
0395177111|3.0|The Hobbit, the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series, is a very well written book, but I recommend it only for those who are truly fans of fantasy books. Tolkein does a very well at describing the adventure of Bilbo and his companions, but sometimes he gets too descriptive and the book gets a little dull. Still, other parts in the book are very exciting. I ended up enjoying this book very much, but I have read better books. Overall, I don't consider this one of Tolkein's best literary works, but it deserves some recognition.
0393307050|2.0|The plot of this novel is taken from the autobiography of Admiral Lord Cochrane, first published in 1860.  The events included describe Cochrane's activities when he commanded the Speedy from 1800-1801 (see &quot;the Autobiography of a Seaman,&quot; by Admiral Lord Cochrane, republished in 2000 by Lyons Press).  O'Brien has replaced Cochrane with the fictional James Aubrey, giving him a similar personality.  While O'Brien has given more color to the story, there is absolutely nothing significant that is original to the plot.  I have to agree with a recent reviewer that the novel describes a lot of action without having a central plot.  The second book in the series, &quot;Post Captain,&quot; seems to be a more original story, but many of O'Brien's novels seem to have taken significant amounts of material from earlier writers (without acknowledging that fact).

6302891272|4.0|I am a student at Nagoya International School in Japan.  In our English Literature class, we had the opportunity to read and study one of Shakespeare's masterpieces \\"Macbeth\\".  While viewing several versions of Macbeth in English, we also watched \\"Throne of Blood\\", a japanese version of Macbeth.<br />While watching this film, I thought that the several rich Shakespearean language, techniques and interesting events in the story were going to be ruined, since the language was different and the setting was different.  But after watching the film, my opinions changed completely.  Kurosawa did a terrific job in analyzing the plot and information and changing it into a japanese fashion. The characters acted out their part showing their unique character just like in Macbeth, and the plot was almost the same as in the original Macbeth.  An interesting thing I found was that, instead of using witches, Kurosawa used evil spirits.  Insetad of knives, he used bows and arrows in his play. These little changes suited the japanese culture, and it was interesting and very entertaining.  I was honestly amazed by this.<br />To everyone who reads my film review, I really do reccomend this film, and hope that you do have a chance to compare the real Macbeth with \\"Throne of Blood\\".  Its interesting similarities and differences will amaze you!

B000002J1F|4.0|People tend to compare Fragile with follow-up Close to the Edge, and indeed they are both from the same general period, feature the same definitive line-up and both constitute the quality core of Yes’s back catalogue. So if you like Close To The Edge, Fragile is pretty similar. The main difference is that whereas Close To The Edge 's songs are expansive affairs, Fragile breaks down into smaller, perhaps more accessible components. Fragile is perhaps sees the band in a little more playful mode, with room for all the band members to contribute their own composition. Fragile also is I think one of Yes's most rock-oriented albums and, even if you find it hard to stomach some of the more self-indulgent pieces, it is I assure you a fun record. In short a classic of English 70s prog rock with great remastered sound, original gatefold sleeve reproduced, complete liner notes, etc. etc. you can’t really go wrong with this one. And if you don’t understand the lyrics, don’t worry, nobody else does either.r
B000053VAF|2.0|In general, I like Kevin Smith's films. I'm not going to praise them as brilliance, as some ardent fans are wont to do, nor dismiss them as total garbage, as Smith's critics often do to compensate for his overratedness. Smith's films, overall, are generally fun, occasionally thought provoking, never quite as deep as they think they are, and playfully verbose. <br />Smith himself readily admits that dialogue is his strong suit, and visuals are his weak suit. That's all fine in movies like Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy, but the broad, comic-book canvas of Dogma called for more, much more, and Smith failed to deliver. Just a smidgen more influence from a talented director of photography would have made a world of difference, even if it were only as much as we saw in Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back--in which camera direction that would be merely ordinary in any other movie seemed amazingly energetic, simply because we knew we were watching a Smith film. <br />I looked forward to this film, having read one of the widely circulated advance versions of the script (forced upon me by an enthusiastic friend, despite my protestations of having the film spoiled). Perhaps that is why the experience of watching Dogma brought so few surprises, and seemed ... well, boring. <br />A second viewing allowed me to get past my initial disappointment, but also gave me a chance to pick out exactly why the film seems so dull: Nothing happens in it. Seriously.<br />Every scene is just talking. Fine in a normal Smith film, but this story seems to demand action which never shows up. Even the talking would be forgivable if we ever heard anything new, but basically, every step of Smith's journey follows the same structure: <br />1. Bethany/Jay/Silent Bob meet a new character (Salma Hayek, Chris Rock, etc.)<BR>2. B/J/SB explain the premise of the film to that character <BR>3. That character (somehow related to God) expounds on how they got screwed in a supposedly daring but actually sort of ordinary way. (A feminist complaint that the Bible is gender-biased? Stop the presses! Hayek's dull scene is a perfect example of how the film fails to be shocking, insightful, or funny, all at once.)<br />This rhythm is slightly altered in scenes where Alan Rickman explains the premise to the protagonists for the first time (the only time it's interesting) and in others where Chris Rock recounts the premise for no reason at all, in case the audience has forgotton. <br />Interspersed with all this, we occasionally get Angels Damon and Affleck, who provide the only real driving action in the film. Even then, they are reduced to spending half the movie talking about what they want to do, and finally getting one scene to kill people 2/3rds of the way through the picture. (Incidentally: The one woman in the boardroom happens to be a good person? What a P.C. cop-out. Why not kill them all?). Late in the game, they suddenly switch roles (Affleck becomes the killer, Damon the nice guy) for no perceptible reason. <br />The finale, which ought to be a showstopper (the Universe is hanging in the balance, after all) feels smaller than it should, and the whole film ends up being a poorly-paced noble effort. A good idea and a nice try, but I don't have the urge to watch it again like some of Smith's other efforts. Say what you want about Smith's lowbrow work like J&SBSB, but it accomplishes what it intends to. Dogma tries to wrap serious examinations of religious faith in the easy-to-swallow trappings of a big comic-book fantasy action picture. But the examinations of faith get redundant quickly, and the fun of the action never arrives. In spite of its lofty goals (some might say pretensions), Dogma fails. As such, it remains the only Askewniverse film left out of my DVD library.
0060537639|4.0|Menzies' evidence of the Chinese exploration of the Australian continent hundreds of years before Capt. Cook is pursuasive and has appeared elsewhere. The evidence of the Ming fleets reaching the N./S. American continents is less overwhelming, but tantalizing. Clearly something was afoot though, as there are multiple maps showing the area before the acknowledged European explorers (Columbus, Magellan, etc.) visited. If the physical evidence from shipwreck sites appears in the next few years to butress Menzies' claims, then this book will rightly be seen as revolutionary. If not, then it will simply be another speculative stab at history.<br />From a literary perspective, Menzies' writing style is uneven. At some points, such as when he is documenting Columbus' pre-1492 voyages to Iceland and the statement by the inhabitants to Columbus that they had been visited by Chinese fleets, the reader's interest level is kept high. At other times, Menzies wanders off onto tangents that have very little to do with the subject matter - how many times does he need to remind us that he enjoyed drinking rum on a Carribean beach?<br />Despite the physical size of the book, however it remains a quick read and can easily be finished in a weekend. About 20% of the book consists of footnotes and other auxiliary material.
B00006LSM3|5.0|I have always been a big Beatles fan, as well as a fan of George's solo work. The quality of every song on this cd is stunning. This cd is instantly likable. You can easily play it back to back, as i often do at work. It's brillance only underscores the tremendous loss that George has become.

B00006DEF9|5.0|Everyone knows this is a one of the most entertaining films.  The DVD and special features enhance the experience and, quite frankly, and simply, put a smile on your face.  But, instead of putting in that Cinderella video for the umpteenth time, try this out.  The tunes are catchy, there's lots of dancing, and it's funny.  My 4-year old daughter, who's addicted to \\"Barbie as Rapunzel,\\" watches this flick in awe, and prances around \\"singin' and dancin' in the rain.\\"  It's a wonderful alternative, and one that adults and children can watch and enjoy.
0060934719|5.0|&quot;Stardust&quot; came in as highly recommended by a friend who is a bookworm, &amp; so I thought it must be great.  The characters in Gaiman's story -- men, witches, elves, ghosts, talking trees &amp; a bratty star --- had it been in another book written by another author would have been dark &amp; scary.  But Gaiman made this unique combination of characters in a fairy land truly enchanting.  Now, not only Dunstan Thorn would benefit from a lifetime of miracles &amp; wonders but the readers as well, who witnessed his &amp; his son's, Tristran, hearts' desire.
6305308659|4.0|I'm going to disagree in part with many of the culture war polemicists and suggest that this movie is not primarily intended to push a particular set of socially liberal values, although it's fairly evident to me that the director identifies with that camp.  Instead, I saw the film as issuing twin condemnations of the knee-jerk responses humans often exhibit upon encountering life's complexities: the urge either to forcibly recreate the world as a tightly controlled utopia aligned with our own ideals, or to withdraw in detached cynicism and employ gallows humor and escapism to ward off issues we prefer not to face. The former pitfall is reflected in the deliberate heavy-handed inflexibility of the 1950s stereotyping, while the latter is exemplified by the initial mindset of the Tobey Maguire character.  <br />I believe Pleasantville urges us instead to confront the complexities of existence and interpersonal relationships head-on--not mindlessly, as in a 1950s sitcom, but armed with an informed value system born of personal experience as well as social traditions.  Sexuality gets a lot of play here because it is the quintessential primal urge, but the film also suggests that there are worthy goals beyond \\"scoring\\", and other barriers to enlightenment besides excess clothing. After the symbolic transition from b/w to color is complete, some of the characters do end up realigning themselves with \\"conservative\\" traditionalist values.  The key is that they do so intelligently and autonomously from a perspective of personal experience.  The message I heard was not that one morality is superior to another, but that the unpredictability and instability that inevitably accompany the gift of free will are no excuse for failing to exercise it.
0312265859|5.0|THis is the first book by Janet Evanovich that I have read but it will not be the last. I love her fast paced entertaining style of writing. This book was great, excellent story plot, mystery and even humor.  I was intriqued with Stepahnie Plum trying to locate the missing girl and her mother, and at times I would find myself laughing out loud at some of the messes she would get herself into or something she or Lula had said.  Great book I hope all her books are this good.

0375707972|5.0|Enjoyed THE READER by Bernhard Schlink.<br />It is a disquieting novel about a fifteen-year old boy who, on his way home from school, falls ill . . . he is rescued by a woman twice his age . . . in time she becomes his lover--only to inexplicably disappear.<br />When the boy next sees her, he is a young law student and<br />she is on trial for a hideous crime . . . the fact that she refuses to defend herself bothers him until he realizes the secret his former lover guards.<br />The writing is superb . . . there were several memorable passages; among them:<br />During the weeks of the trial, I felt nothing: my feelings were<br />numbed. Sometimes I poked at them, and imaged Hanna doing<br />what she was accused of doing as clearly as I could, and also<br />doing what the hair on her neck and the birthmark on her shoulder recalled to my mind. It was like a hand pinching an arm numbed by an injection. The arm doesn't register that it is being pinched by the hand, the hand registers that it is pinching the arm, and at first the mind cannot tell the two of them apart. But a moment later it distinguishes them quite clearly. Perhaps the hand has pinched so hard that the flesh stays white for a while. Then the blood flows back and the spot regains its color. But that does not bring back sensation.<br />I tried to talk about the problem with friends. Imagine someone is racing intentionally towards his own destruction and you can save him-do you go ahead and save him? Imagine there's an operation, and the patient is a drug user and the drugs are incompatible with the anesthetic, but the patient is ashamed of being an addict and does not want to tell the anesthesiologist-do you talk to the anesthesiologist? Imagine a trial and a defendant who will be convicted if he doesn't admit to being left-handed-do you tell the judge what's going on? Imagine he's gay, and could not have committed the crime because he's gay, but is ashamed of being gay. It isn't a question of whether the defendant should be ashamed of being left-handed or gay-just imagine that he is.<br />I tried to approach my later relationships better, and to get into them more deeply. I admitted to myself that a woman had to move and feel a bit like Hanna, smell and taste a bit like her for things to be good between us. I told them about Hanna. And I told them more about myself than I had told Gertrud; they had to be able to make sense of whatever they might find disconcerting in my behavior and moods. But the women didn't want to hear that much. I remember Helen, and American literary critic who stroked my back silently and soothingly as I talked, and continued to stroke me just as silently and soothingly after I'd stopped speaking. Gesina, a psychoanalyst, thought I needed to work through my relationship with my mother. Did it not strike me that my mother hardly appeared in my story at all? Hilke, a dentist, kept asking about the time before<br />we met, but immediately forgot whatever I told her. So I stopped<br />talking about it.

B00003CWL6|1.0|I can't understand the 'beauty' of American Beauty. There is no \\"LOL FUNNY WITTY\\" or \\"DARK HUMOR LOL!\\" as people would have you believe. I get sick of people's intelligence being insulted because they don't like this trashy excuse of a movie. It takes the worst aspects of an average, ordinary life, heavily exagerates them, and shoves them down your throat. And when it's not finding ways to show your teenage girls' breasts for no apparent reason, it's trying to subconciously implant stupid stereotypes like that armed forces veterans are homophobic psycopaths, or that middle aged white women are whores (well that may be true from my experience, but never the less!)<br />This movie does not entertain or enlighten, it only takes the things we wish to escape from in our lives and forces them into one of our only place of refuge, the cinema.<br />People you do not have to like this movie just because people who claim to have a high IQ think it's 'witty' and 'inspirational'- Trust your own opinion and realize that this is trash and don't let them force this kind of 'enterntainment' on us again :(

B000069CWE|5.0|Anyone that tells you that &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is better than &quot;Reanimation&quot; has to be out of their mind. I'm not gonna front, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is a great album in most respects. &quot;Reanimation&quot;, the album that remixes all of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;'s tracks as well as &quot;My December&quot; and &quot;High Voltage&quot;, is what &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; could and should have been in the first place. Most artists would get big-name producers and artists to do guest spots and remix songs. Linkin Park did the complete opposite (which I admire, because there's so much other talent out there that aren't mainstream) for this remix project. From well-known rock stars to underground hip-hoppers, the album features guest appearances from KoRn's Johnattan Davis (on the &quot;One Step Closer&quot; remix, adding that vampire feel), Staind's Aaron Lewis adds an emotional feel on the &quot;Crawling&quot; remix, and underground producer Alchemist(who also produced cuts for Nas on &quot;God's Son&quot; &amp; Dilated Peoples, who oddly enough, also do a remix on this album, the &quot;High Voltage&quot; remix with Pharoahe Monch) as well as Jurassic 5 member Chali 2NA give &quot;Forgotten&quot; that dark feel. Other standouts include the X-Ecutioners' track with a freestyle by The Roots' Black Thought (&quot;X-Ecutioner Style&quot;) and a new take on &quot;By Myself&quot;, Josh Abraham &amp; Deftones guitarist Stef Carpenter make the music more aggressive than the original. If you previously weren't into underground music, after listening to this rockin' album you'll want to purchase albums from Motion Man, Jurassic-5, Taproot, The Roots, Aceyalone, who all make guest appearances on this as well.

076781326X|5.0|I have no idea who read the dark, sad tale of Oliver Twist, and thought &quot;Why, this would make a great lighthearted musical full of precious scamps and good natured bad guys.&quot;  Whoever that person was, I thank them, because the same thought would have never occurred to me.<br />&quot;Oliver!&quot; is that most Hollywood of Hollywood musicals.  It is a formal stage adaptation, with little attempt to make the musical scenes natural such as in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; or even &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.&quot;  The cast breaks out into song with abandon, and dances with joy.  Several of the numbers are tops, such as &quot;Consider Yourself...&quot; and &quot;I'd Do Anything.&quot;  Several are mediocre, but still do the trick.  Oliver's voice is a little funny, as it was actually dubbed by a young girl to achieve an &quot;innocent&quot; effect.  The Dodger and Fagin are the real stars, getting all of the best lines and songs.<br />The story adaptation choices are interesting, removing almost all of the brutal elements of the story, as well as Monks and the convoluted nature of Oliver's origin.  Fagin and The Artful Dodger are not only allowed to survive the adventure, as opposed to swinging from the gallows, but they make their merry way into the streets of London.  What is left of the plot is still Oliver Twist, and makes a fine basis for the story.  Bill Sikes is still Bill Sikes, and Nancy is still Nancy, with all that that entails

0151006903|4.0|I will not bore you with a re-cap of the entire plot of the book, suffice it to say that the title character is a charming liar who, in recounting the &quot;story&quot; of his life following the collapse of Byzantium, manages to take credit for being at every seminal moment in late 11th century history.  Eco's most delicious skills as a writer are put to good use in this entertaining tale: his rich use of language, and sense of mischief really shine in Baudolino.  But...not all of it works as well as Eco may have wished.  There are long passages which might be fascinating to a medieval studies professor, but leave the average intelligent reader stifling a yawn. Read it, but know what you're getting into (I kept a dictionary by my bedside to look up obscure words and object descriptions).  That said, there are as many vignettes that delight, move, and entrall (the section where Baudolino meets and falls in love with a Hypatia, weaving ancient Greek myth into a tale already packed with fantastic creatures is nothing short of brilliant).  And you have to admire the fact that Eco's final line, archly delivered by Baudolino, is clearly a tongue-in-cheek jest at himself. With so winning an author, it's hard not to like his creation.

0380778556|4.0|I'm not really a reader of romances but heard this one was a great suspense novel as well, a classic made into a film that starred Laurence Olivier and won the academy award for best picture in 1941. A 40something millionaire widower suddenly marries a young woman with no money, background or breeding and takes her to live at his estate, Manderley. She is haunted by the presence of Rebecca, his first wife, whom she imagines her husband is still in love with.<br />I thought the second half of the book much better than the first, I don't know how I stayed through the first 150 pages, which is the same tiresome whining of the main character over and over. The narrator is so mean spirited, self-centered and just too stupid to be believed, searching & sifting through every conversation, the most minor social encounters, digging and digging and digging to find the insults she believes everyone is directing at her. Perhaps this character is dated and can only be appreciated through 1930's lenses as a sensitive, unworldly, eager to please young woman, but I found it hard to be on her side and couldn't identify with anything she felt. The second part of book seems to deserve the suspense label and really does become a page turner once it leaves the realm of the narrator's inner doubts about her marriage and moves to the mystery of how Rebecca really did die.
1573225517|4.0|One of my weaknesses is a fondness for novels about fictitious music groups, evidenced by some of my favorites: George R.R.

To this group I can now add the first novel by Nick Hornby, appropriately titled after words found on many of your finest long-playing records.<br />Rob, Barry and Dick are clerks at an offbeat record store, the type of store which never seems to attract many customers but still manages to stay in business. They've got some of the latest CDs, but their mainstay business is handling those obscure wax singles and recordings by local artists. The three also have a fondness of putting together lists of their \\"Top 5\\" things: films, Elvis Costello songs, episodes of \\"Cheers,\\" etc. The story is told in the first person by Rob, as his Top Five list of ex-girlfriends.<br />The whole premise here is unassuming, yet Hornby's gift for capturing the ennui of the dropped out class with gifts for accumulating an extraordinary amount of trivia is perfect for the plot. While this sounds suspiciously like a Generation X novel, or maybe even the plot to Kevin Smith's movie \\"Clerks,\\" Hornby escapes the genre by writing a charming book filled with hope and love (although there's some guilt and pain that has to be dealt with before you get to the end). I enjoyed Hornby's style as well--clean, with lots of true- sounding dialogue, and embellishment only when necessary. A great first novel, and a writer to watch for in the future.
0425098478|5.0|I finally ordered this book to see for myself if all the hype was true.  After reading through the pages very quickly (it only took a couple of brief sittings), I was thoroughly impressed.  Blanchard and Johnson truly have a classic here, a volume that fulfills its high expectations.<br />The key to the success of this book is the combination of its simplicity and its practicality.  Three lessons are given to managers:  the one-minute goal, the one-minute praising, and the one-minute reprimand.  The material is presented in a parable-like format, which makes the concepts even easier to grasp.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  For the small price paid and the short time required to read it from cover to cover, it is a superb investment.  If you are any type of leader or manager, READ THIS BOOK!
B00003CXXM|1.0|Once again we see the shortcomings of a movie trying to represent a book.  The book of the same name by Robert Ludlum is a gripping, tight, suspenseful novel that is hard to put down.  This movie should definitely not be called the Bourne Identity.  What a joke!  Please don't waste your money on this movie.  Read the book instead.
B00006V9A0|4.0|I won't say its a bad album but, me as a fan of nirvana I personally think they forgot a lot of crazy, grunge taste songs with a kick of alternative sound. Like for example Verse Chorous Verse also known as Sappy was not even on the album, which I think the song is a masterpiece. Also songs like : Even In His Youth, D7, Return Of The Rat,Oh The Guilt, Opinion(Electric Style),Curmudgeon,I hate my self and want to die,In his Hands, Here She Comes Now, Clean Up before she Comes, Born In A Junk Yard. All those songs are the best rare songs that Kurt Cobain wrote  and never were released on Nirvana's LP albums. By not applying all of these songs to the album is a greater upset. It might have the unreleased song \\"You know You're Right\\" by just giving the a better taste, meaning applying the rare songs will make it a must album to own and to have as Nirvana Collection.<br />Although the album wasn't that bad it's mostly a greatist hits album to own from nirvana and to here the album over and over again will keep the legendary band nirvana live again. Therefore is a must have album to rock fans who don't know nirvana yet and a collection album for nirvana fans.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The marshall mathers LP is a classic eminem album.  Eminem put himself right in the center of the rap world after this release and was able to sell enormous quantities of it while being torn by the media. Eminem is able to talk about his life problems in a very satirical format keeping his audience entertained.  This album is right behinf infinite and the slim shady lp for the best eminem cd
0553260111|5.0|Let me start by saying that this novel is completly different than the movie.  Not that the movie was not great, and very well done, but I thought I would put that out there.<br />Ok, now on with the review.  This is the first book in the Bourne Trillogy.  In \\"The Bourne Identity\\" we meet Jason Bourne, who by all means is lost and has no idea who he is, but has amazing abilities and knowledge that you would expect from a secret agent.  This novel is extremely fast paced with a new twist every chapter.  I will say that the writing is a little advanced and the story can be confusing, but as long as you read it strait through you will get it.  I would definetly suggest not for you to read this book on and off, if you do, you will be as lost as Jason Bourne is.  <br />You really get placed inside of Bourne's shoes in this novel, which is a great feeling when reading.  I really felt as if I was the one being chased, and could not put this book down for one minute.  I would stay up all night just find out what was going to happen next. <br />You will love this book if you are a fan of spy novels or anything by Tom Clancy.  Dont let yourself pass this novel by.
B0000039PW|5.0|Ya heard of us, the murderous, most shady, the one that low lately, the feds hate me. Yeah, one of the greatest lyrisist ever. That was from &quot;Puffy's&quot; forever albulm. My oppinion? Anything Biggie made should go in your vault. I feel track 2 on &quot;Puffy's&quot; forever albulm proves he was about to slaughter sh..<BR>Man, it rip's me that he's gone. There are rapper's and there are true lyrisit. No disrespect to pac, but I will never lable Biggie a rapper. And as for Puffy, I can't really knock him for what he's done. But,I think he'll be around a lot longer if he pushes his talent more than he pushes his self.
B00004RF97|5.0|Every time I rented this, I would watch it at least twice if not more.  I decided it was time to purchase it instead.  It is lighthearted and fun and just plain entertaining.
B0000024IE|5.0|I Reviewed this one a while back. Get it before it's out of print.
B000068802|5.0|These 5 guys have gathered together there musical talents and make an etremely awesome pop-punk cd! The songs are catchy and leave you wanting to hear more. \\"I'm just a kid\\" and \\"I'd do any thing\\" their hit singles and their almost released single \\"addicted\\" are all on the cd and very cool as well. You will hear voices such as Mark Hoppus's from Blink 182 and Joel Madden's from Good Charlotte. This is a very good cd and I think you should check it out now!!!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I've been a Cash fan since my parents used to play I Walk the Line on an old all in one Mercury stereo system.  This is a heavy, heavy album.  First of all, the title track, The Man Comes Around, sounds like classic Cash.  It has received a lot of radio play on the local college folk show, which is where I first heard it.  This track is clean and crisp with a certain Ring of Fire feel to it.  It opens with Mr. Cash reciting a poetic verse his voice old and scratchy.  Then the album kicks in.  Many of the songs on this album are sad, and depressed.  He has been sick for the past few years and this recording often feels like Mr. Cash is coming to terms with his own mortality.  Like many of his albums, this one is full of cover tunes.  He does a very decent,true to himself version of Hurt by Nine Inch Nails.  He also does Depeche Mode's Personal Jesus, which comes off as positive and preachy.  Another cover to remember is a version Danny Boy, just the man and a pipe organ.  It's an eerie<br />funeral piece that left me a bit choked up.  Also on this disc is a version of Bridge Over Troubled Water, which he doesn't pull off too well, but I'll let it slide because of my own prejudice and dislike of that song.  Overall, this is a hauntingly beautiful masterpiece by Mr. Cash.
B00005JL2O|4.0|If you love Austin Powers this is the movie for you,baby! Austin Powers in Goldmember is a combination of James Bond meets Shaft!This movie is so funny. This time Mike Myers plays not only Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard but a crazy disco loving, fruity man named Goldmember who lost his genitalia in an unfortuante smelting accident! Dr. Evil wants to melt the polar ice caps and he and Frau, Number 2, Scott, and Mini-Me (played very good by Mindy Sterling, Robert Wagner, Seth Green, and Verne Troyer) steal Austin's father Nigel, played by none other than Mr. Micheal Caine! Goldmember has him hostage in his disco club back in 1975! Austin boogies in time and meets the jive afro headed Foxxy Cleopatra played by Beyonce Knowles, who did a great job in her first big screen movie! Now, I don't believe in ruining a movie so I won't! However ,the infinifilm features on this dvd are great! You can see four music video's and plenty of behind the scenes footage along with bloopers and other things! This movie was just amazing and was packed with jokes however, the film really didnt tie back in with the whole secret spy thing, however it was really funny and people with odd names are back just like they were in the first two films! Fook Mi and Fook Yu, japenese twins! And of course Austin alwaze has to have a new girlfriend, and this time its Foxxy Cleopatra, a bad mother-shut cho mouth! The laughs keep coming as Austin and Foxxy try and save the world! Its SOLID GOLD, baby!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I went to see this with my wife, and after the first half hour we decided it was a little too &quot;out there&quot; for us, and we left.  Once on DVD, I decided to give it another chance, and though the first 45 minutes is a little weird, it starts to grow on you.  But after that is where it really takes off.  In the end it was one of the most moving movies of the year to me.  Full of MUSIC and life!<br />I bought the DVD and love it.  At least no one lives next door, or they'd probably complain about me singing along with it in full voice.  Don't be surprised if you find yourself doing the same thing.<br />As an added note, I feel the DTS track on it is slightly fuller and more rewarding.  I definitely recommend this DVD.
B000021Y7X|5.0|This is the best concert film ever. Directed by the genius Jonathan Demme, we never see the crowd, and seldom even hear it. The sound is great. The song list is great, and many genres of music are represented.<br />I watch this over and over and can play it as background music without even watching it. It's great!
B000002JNJ|5.0|Two words must have. Not a true metal fan if this isnt in your collection!
1884822312|3.0|Yeah, the book is massive, the price is good. It will certainly do much good for anyone's brain cells, but.... unfortunately I have noticed some irritating tendency in it, although probably not even meant by its author! I would call it: if you have a Queen, sacrifice it! So, my way of working on the puzzles in this book became the following:<BR>Step 1: Do you have a Queen? (answer: yes in 90% of cases)<BR>Step 2: If yes, look how to sacrifice it! Unfortunately, it worked with me in 80% of cases. Only sometimes the Queen goes only on second move, versus on the very first one in majority of cases...<BR>Well, what I would expect is a little less obvious (and trivial...) &quot;pattern&quot; of solving the puzzles. I would expect more of a variety, rather than a &quot;prove correctness of a Queen sacrifice&quot; theme.
0345423496|2.0|The Odyssey of the Monolith and the Hal 9000 computer is among the most fabled stories in all of science fiction.  The first in the series, the movie &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, is considered by many to be one of the greatest science fiction movies ever (although, I do not share opinion, even though it's a good film).  It was followed up on book and on film by the successful &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact (Odyssey Two in the book)&quot;.  &quot;2010&quot; was a more straightforward story, but it pushed for greater ideas about HAL's existence and the purpose of the Monolith.  The third part of this series, the book &quot;2061: Odyssey Three&quot;, reached the satisfying conclusion of the tortured Dr. Heywood Floyd's involvement in the Odyssey.  It also helped expand the understanding of the purpose of the Monolith.  &quot;3001:  The Final Odyssey&quot; presented a tremendous opportunity to tie up all the loose ends and answer all the questions.  Unfortunately, Arthur C. Clarke's choice in story direction answered all those questions incorrectly.  Clarke does reveal the purpose of the Monolith, but what he reveals renders everything we knew about it in the previous three stories totally moot.  I will not reveal what it is.  You should still read it to find out.  I just ended up being very disappointed by the resolution.  The ratings given by other reviewers show that they felt much the same way.  <BR><BR>   The irony of the story is that it had great potential.  After 1,000 years of floating in virtual suspended animation in the 'absolute zero' graveyard of space, astronaut Frank Poole's body is discovered in remarkably well preserved, and barely alive (!), form.  Poole's amazing revival has provided humanity with an unbelievable to tap into the mind of the only living person to have had first contact with the Monolith.  Poole doesn't have too much trouble adjusting the changes in the culture he knew and his newfound celebrity status.  He comes to terms with the events of the past and tries to help humanity understand the Monolith as it impacts its future.  This is actually quite an entertaining story arc and the reason I didn't give this book a one-star rating.  It just feels right reconnecting with Poole.  Alas, the book goes south when Clarke defines the purpose of the Monolith.  It's very disappointing and leaves the reader flat.  Still, for Odyssey completists, you need to read the book to see how it ends (regardless of the disappointment).  At only 274 pages, you won't have risked to great a time investment in the process.
B00006IU73|5.0|I've been a long-time fan of Marillion, Flower Kings, Pink Floyd, Dream Theater, Yes, Radiohead, XTC, Peter Gabriel, etc. and also listen to jazz quite a lot now but listened to metal in the late '70s and early '80s in my teens.  I picked up this cd because of word of mouth and reviews here, not having bought a Porcupine Tree disc before.  I was floored.  Every track is excellent.  Why aren't these guys better known?  Their sound is unique but blends just about everything I like to listen to into one package.  It's kind of like Tool without anyone screaming lyrics, what Radiohead could have been if they had stuck with the guitars, a more lyrically accessible Flower Kings, heavier than Spock's Beard.  It is true some of the vocal harmonies sound very much like some of XTC's work.  The band members blend very well together but the guitar is the star in this band compared to Dream Theater where the music is dominated by the drums.  And, for the price it's the best cheap cd I've bought since the Norah Jones disc.
0812550706|5.0|Ender Wiggin is a Third.  In an era in which human population controls limit families to only two children, Ender was a government authorized birth of a third child.  The reason for allowing the exception was the increase the chances of finding viable candidates to attend the military's Battle School to help win an interstellar war against an alien insectoid species referred to as Buggers.  The Wiggin family already had two children, Peter and then Valentine.  Each one demonstrated some of the characteristics the military was looking for.  Peter had the ruthless nature and ambition while Valentine had the tempered knowledge and compassion.  Combined, those traits would be exactly what the Battle School was looking for.  Hence, the government authorized Ender's birth in hopes that this 'third' would be the perfect candidate.  If so, he would be taken from the family at age 5 for Battle School training.  If not, the Wiggin family would count their blessings of having another child of their own.  Various secretive tests seemed to indicate that Ender might not be the chosen one until one day, he stands up to a bully who had been tormenting him all year.  Ender brutally attacked the bully leaving him prostrate on the ground.  He hated having to resort to violence, but he felt he had no other choice but to hurt him enough so that he wouldn't try to hurt Ender again.  That rationale proved that Ender was the answer the military's wishes.  A child with his vast capacity for knowledge and his conflicted temperament would be the perfect child to train to one day lead troops in victorious battle against the Buggers.  <BR><BR>   Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game\\" is one of legendary works of modern science fiction.  A winner of both the prestigious Hugo and Nebula awards, \\"Ender's Game\\" has found its way on to numerous school reading lists and in the heart of every science fiction fan.  Ender Wiggin is one of the more memorable characters created in sci-fi.  Ripped from his homelife at a very young age to become the next great military genius, Ender struggles mightily with his motivations to continue going and with the various tests the Battle School administrators have foisted upon him to see if he truly is the chosen leader.  Ender is emotional torn regarding his family.  He doesn't particularly miss his parents because he knows that they have already accepted that they will never see him again and have moved on.  He doesn't miss Peter because he was another violent bully in Ender's life.  He does long for the companionship of his sister Valentine because she was one of the few people he talk to and who would stand up for him.  In Battle School, Ender overcomes early difficulties and resentments to earn the respect of his fellow young soldiers through brilliant displays of leadership.  But, just as soon as he feels comfortable with his fellow comrades, he is yanked from that army and thrust into a completely new situation with older soldiers and new sets of hostilities to overcome.  All this is designed to see if Ender will end up being able to lead the full military armada that is massing for a final attack at the Bugger homeworld and will be emerging from its hyperspace journey in just a few shorts years.  Ender seeks solace in a virtual reality video game, mentorship from Mazer Rackham (the hero of an earlier Bugger War), and any number of ways avoid reaching the mental breaking point that he is careening towards.  Can he complete the training and lead the fleet in a mission to save humanity?  Are the military's objectives as clear as they would like them to seem?  In the end, will any of what Ender does, matter?  All of these questions drive Ender and provide the fuel for this spectacular story.  <BR><BR>   The Battle School is a finely realized setting for Ender's struggles.  One wonders what it would be like to enter battle training arena.  The propaganda put forth by the government and military elements harkens back to the propaganda of World War II and some of the themes in Robert Heinlein novels.  \\"Ender's Game\\" stands alone as a spectacular literary achievement and also serves as the start of the remarkable Ender's series of books.  \\"Ender's Game\\" is book to be read once and then read again and again.  Few novels have that quality.
B000000WA4|5.0|Not knowing the Pumpkins very well past &quot;Zero&quot;, i bought this album in 5th grade, setting myself up for a new love. I knew little about music but i knew the album was good. I love looking back at how the album confused me because there would be &quot;Tales of a Scorched Earth&quot; and then &quot;Beautiful&quot; on the same album.  I was used to basically each album having one essential mood.  But the pumpkins were much more than that.  I grew to love Mellon Collie much more because it puts out sad, uplifting, blissful, mellow, and raging moods in one album. It's versatility makes it one of my favorite albums.  Because while it has these opposite moods, it still keeps the same style, which Corgan is obviously the brains behind.  WHy it I havent seen it in the top ten of great rock albums is a question i have yet to answer.
B0000797IO|1.0|Jennifer Aniston (Friends) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) I figured that this movie couldn't go wrong.....<br />Boy was I wrong.<br />Movie was slow moving, bland plot, predictable results, and did nothing to keep your interest.  These two actors' performances were good, but could never be enough to save the movie.
B00006AW2O|2.0|12 x 5 is the Rolling Stones 2nd album, released back in late `64. You get their interpretation of bluesy and rock classics, plus a few originals. Now this was never my favorite Stones album, but I had to get it so I could complete my collection that goes up till \\"Sticky Fingers\\". I never could get into \\"Exile on Main Street\\" or anything after that. <BR>The songs from 12 x 5 that still hold up in my opinion are: Around &amp; Around, Confessin` The Blues, Time Is On My Side, Good Times, Bad Times, It`s All Over Now. <BR>After this, I think the album totally falls apart. <BR>But lately, I've been listening to Deep Purple's 1973 album \\"Who Do We Think We Are\\" <BR>and perhaps that's just not fair to the Stones'12 x 5 album. For the hard core Stones fan only.
B000002UVX|5.0|No need to further garner praise for the performance here, just a gripe that the domestic version never included the tracks STOP or FOXEY LADY from the perfomance (they were available on the import version)...pity, as they both contibute much to the Hendrix canon and should not be kept from eager ears.
B00005OAIE|5.0|What can I say about John Mayer? A whole lot.  His album &quot;Room for Squares&quot; is full of fun lyrics and riffs that made me smile.  His song &quot;83&quot; took me back  to my childhood as he wishes he where &quot;six years old again&quot; and pretending to be a superhero.  He writes and sings about things that make my heart sing.  His music is not &quot;deep&quot; or &quot;unapproachable&quot;.  It's light-hearted, fresh, and original.  I adore this c.d. as well as the artist himself.  I believe his music is a great alternative to all the &quot;bubblegum, Britney Spears music&quot; out there. What's so great about this aritist is you feel like you know him personally after listening to his music.  He plays from his heart. His music is hip, light, and friendly, with a Dave Matthew's feel to it.  Buy it!  You'll love it!
B0000640VO|4.0|A very charming movie with a charming lead.  Made me think a little of the early Holly Golightly.  But, this is a very French movie, filled with engaging situations carried along by a light, affecting story. The camera work is fantastic and the colors so rich that they seem to bleed off the screen.  It is a movie you can watch over and over again.
0060977264|5.0|Stunning book.  I am not a normal reader of such metaphysical works but was caught by the title and curiosity.  The book's author impecibly reveals his views of life and love and their true value and meaning. It was a pleasure to read about two lost loves from childhood who reunite as adults in search of &quot;love&quot; in their life. Not your typical love story. My favorite line is on page 148;&quot;Break the glass, please - and free us from all these damned rules, from needing to find an explanation for everything, from doing only what others approve of.&quot;  That sums up the meaning of the story. Love has no rules, requires no ones approval,is a precious gift and to experience that &quot;magic moment&quot; some people will wait a lifetime for.
0316666343|5.0|This book is one of the most beautifully touching novels I have read in a long time. Susie watches from her heaven as her family develops without her in an amazingly real way. She follows them through first loves, seperation and reunion. The world Susie left behind is so real it hurts, and Alice Sebold does a wonderful job of showing the characters' pain at losing her. If you are looking for a book that will make you laugh, cry, and think, this is the one for you. It's heartbreaking and soothing at the same time.
1573225517|3.0|The novel &quot;high fidelity&quot; by nick hornby is the story of a boy named rob who is really frustrated by his love affairs.He tells us about his relationships so far and about the one he is experiencing at the moment.<BR>I think its a homorous book, which is written in a very sarcastic style describing himself and his excessive selfpitty.The language used by hornby is very lifely, some parts a written in dialogues, similar to a screen-play,just as in real life.Thus one easily can understand and feel with the invidual characters, as they all are described in a very explicit way with a love for detail.<BR>I truly can recommend reading this book.<BR>julia
0440178002|5.0|I loved this book... I read it first in the early '80's.   It has caused me to have a life-long love of Japanese culture.   I do find it interesting that part of the authors background included a stay in a Japanese POW camp.  Somehow he went behind the anger and horror of war and became interested in the culture of his captors.  This is not a historical novel but does indeed teach much of Japanese custom. Thank you James Clavell for one of the best books I have ever read!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is one of the best new artist around.  His guitar playing is masterful.  Not only can he sing but he can play with the best of them.  Don't write negative about this album until you listen to the music itself.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Don't let the naysayers put you off... this is an excellent collection of Fleetwood Mac's post-1975 music (the band has existed since 1967).<br />Longtime Mac fans were disappointed by the lack of pre-1975 music here, but the truth is, the majority of American fans are not the least bit familiar with the band's earlier music. <BR>Aside from perhaps \\"Oh Well,\\" and \\"Hypnotized,\\" which still get airplay on Classic Rock radio stations, the pre-Buckingham & Nicks material is not widely known to the audience this compilation is aimed at.<br />Those wishing to hear early Mac have little to complain about, as dozens of compilations exist focusing on that era of the band's career. This collection is merely meant to spotlight the achievements of the most commercially successful version of Fleetwood Mac, and to serve as an appetizer for their upcoming Spring 2003 release... and it does that quite remarkably.<br />The hits \\"Over My Head,\\" and \\"Rhiannon,\\" are included in their (arguably) more well-known radio mixes (as are the slightly lesser-known singles, \\"Sisters Of The Moon,\\" and \\"Think About It\\"). <BR>The inclusion of these radio mixes is a definite plus, and I'm surprised that anyone has complained about their inclusion, when the album versions are easily obtainable, and as this release marks the first time these mixes have ever been available on CD.<br />The classic non-album track \\"Silver Springs,\\" is available here in an alternate mix, highlighting Stevie Nicks' passionate vocals during the song's coda.<br />The biggest chart hits are justifiably well-represented (\\"Little Lies,\\" \\"Dreams,\\" \\"Tusk,\\" and a slew of others), but thankfully space was also made for many of the band's other essential tracks... such as \\"The Chain,\\" and \\"Storms.\\"<br />One can always find something to grumble about with any \\"best of\\" collection... the omission of one song in favor of another, for example... but what IS included here, definitely makes up for anything that's missing.<br />Casual fansshould be more than satisfied, as all the well-known radio favorites are present and accounted for... and the aforementioned radio mixes make this a must-have for die-hard fans.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This CD prepared me for my first half marathon. These old Carter family songs were a delight to listen to and worked well to pep me up during long runs. I bought a copy for my 11 year old neice, and the whole family--especially my 9 year old nephew and his father--could not stop playing it. This CD makes a great gift!
B00006LLJ4|5.0|I was worried about this movie when I first heard of it, thinking that Spielberg and Cruise would ruin a perfectly good Phillip K. Dick sci-fi story. However, the movie turned out to be great. In the future, murders don't happen anymore because of 3 pre-cognitive people who see murders happen days or weeks in advance. A pre-crime department is born to apprehend murderers seen in the precog's visions before they get the chance to carry through their murders. Something has to go wrong, though, since it's a human system. Suddenly the chief of the pre-crime department is running for his life when the precogs dream of him murdering a stranger.<br />Overall, a pretty good movie. Great action scenes, as well as some superb futuristic stuff (just look at the traffic scenes! Eek!).
B00005JKJA|5.0|I know everyone is going to have there opinions about this movie. Everything doesn't have to have some exposions and a predictable ending. I am sick of seeing the same films made over and over and you always know the good always will win. This is a film about deep obcession, the worst kind. If people can watch this film and get intouch with there deep inner most feelings they may understand. WARNING: Most of this film takes place in the subconscious/mind so alot of it isn't suppose to make sense. Most of our dreams or thoughts don't so why should a film that is obviously conveying that should? Mulholland, serves as sort of a parent movie to the 1997 \\"Lost Highway\\" which I found \\"Brillant\\"! \\"Lost Highway\\" was too a David Lynch film about obcession but with a darker and more surreal meaning. This is a film about a girl that was having \\"Delusions of Granduer\\" and was destroyed by guilt. Basically she dreamed that she was going to be a super actress. In actuality she was a struggling actress and her girl friend was the one on top of the world. When the movie flips to reality what you thought was actually happening was only a figment of her guilt and imagination. She was obcessed with the woman actress and they had a relationship. But when the dark haired beauty decided to call it quits and marry the producer you see just how obcessed she really was. Not only did she dump her she decided to torture and tease and rub it in her face. So to some extent you realize that the woman was evil. Also she was having an affair with another female that was revealed later in this film. The characters are switched around but in the end you will see who's names match up with who. Basically the disturbed and disgruntled actress that was dumped was a bit more in need than we know. There is a scene in the film where she is on the coach\\" and you can guess what she was doing\\" reminising about the black haired beauty. But any way when it all comes down this movie ends in turmoil. Basically aproduct of guilt and demons chasing her to her death.The mysterious toy looking blue key serves as a dream version of the real key. The real key was placed at the time to mark that the job was done! And when you watch the film you will know what the job was. The little people or old people in the film they served as satire for \\"The Demons\\". Mulholland Dr..is another phycological journey just as Lost Highway was. David Lynch keep doing what you are doing your the greatest! This film was nicely filmed with alot of passion and sensuality.<BR>                    Note:<BR>If anyone ever read or saw interviews with David Lynch. He doesn't do commentary's nor does he give the options on DVD to skip to the next seen. He wants people to experience the whole film and interpret it for your self. If it takes a person 10 watches then he has done his job!<br />I personally enjoy a challenge but most people don't. If you don't like to exercise your brain or get intouch with deep innner emotions? This film is definitley not for you!<br />I Recommend \\" Parent Movie \\"Lost Highway\\" in addition to this!<br />A

B00007H1Y2|5.0|Has any musician, dead or alive, appeared in a wider variety of musical settings than Ry Cooder?  None comes to mind.  The amazing thing about his cross-culturalism is how effectively he picks up the basic vibe of the music he's exploring while still putting his own stamp on the proceedings, all the while maintaining a deep (yet not slavish) respect as he playfully deconstructs and reassembles it.<br />His latest, Mambo Sinuendo, a dual project with Cuban guitar legend Manuel Galabán, strikes me as the finest Cooder record to date.  I've listened to this remarkable album many times, and each listen has revealed something new:  Cooder's tuba-like sound on \\"Bodas de Oro\\"; the nimble acoustic bass of Orlando \\"Cachaíto\\" Lopez, always establishing the perfect rhythmic underpinning; the deep swing melded to relaxed yet intense interaction that suffuses the whole record; the tricky rhythmic shifts that relocate a piece from Latin America to the American Southwest to Hawaii.  It's because Cooder has (seemingly effortlessly) acquired such a broad and deep musical vocabulary that he's able to musically jet, as it were, from country to country with such ease. <br />Highlights for me include a very tender reading of the chestnut \\"Secret Love,\\" the Al Caiola-meets-Sonny Chillingworth vibe of \\"Drume Negrita,\\" \\"Los Twangueros,\\" with Ry making his recorded debut on vibes (!) and sounding, if I may say so, like an inebriated south of the border denizen in hat and sneakers, the old Pérez Prado number, \\"Patricia,\\" given an affectionately funky reading and coming across, strangely, at once hoary and impossibly modern, \\"Caballo Viejo,\\" a cumbia-like piece featuring some very tasty farfisa-organ-sounding guitar and killer drum work by the dual drum team of Jim Keltner and Joachim Cooder.  The title cut shines brightest, with some way whacked-out organ, tasty chick background vocals, a guest appearance by Herb Alpert (who sounds surprisingly nimble), and Joachim all over his drum kit.But it's all good.  <br />One small irritation:  I don't think all the musicians are listed.  For example, I can clearly hear an uncredited piano on \\"Bolero Sonámbulo.\\"  But that's a small matter, certainly not enough to topple this astounding record from the position it holds for as the premier release of the millennium so far.
B00004RJ71|5.0|dang, &quot;Blood In Blood Out&quot; is truly the best thug-family type movie i've seen.  this movie gives you a first look of life in the hood (if you havent already expienced it for yourself) and how hard it is to live in a drastic environment where tomorrow isn't promised.  i would recommend this movie to anyone no matter what there background because its truly a reality check type of movie and a very exciting movie as well.  i would also recommend &quot;American Me&quot;, this movie is about the same theme as &quot;Blood In Blood Out&quot; but from a different perspective and its a true story.
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam has reawaken the true poetry and riveting music that is Pearl Jam.  Vedder's vocals sound great and the guitar work is stunning at times! Riot Act is a triumph.  It starts and ends with power of classic PJ and yet remains stylistically fresh.  Songs like Thumbing My Way and All or Nothing show the great successers to Black and Nothingman. I have seen many reviews recommend Ten, Versus, and Vitology over Riot Act, and its true they are better albums.  But if you have not bought ALL three of those albums, I don't know why you would even consider listening to Riot Act.  I believe this album continues building on Pearl Jam's rapidly evolving style, and is the next great album in there vault.  Buy Riot Act, and if you haven't bought Ten, Vs., and Vitology, get them.  All of these albums are must have.

0736041850|5.0|Strength Training Anatomy is an excellent guide to your body's muscles.  The book is in full color and is divided into the following sections: arms, shoulders, chest, back, legs, buttocks, and abs.   Within each section there are at least 15 exercise demonstrations targeting the various muscle groups.  What makes this book good?  Apart from doing chest exercises, for example, this book educates the user on different types of exercises along with proper technique and its impact on the muscle.  So the end result is that you are able to design your routine to give you not only mass, but importantly the \\"cut\\" look.   I recommend this book along with The Workout Log, which Amazon also carries, to keep track of your progress.

0393317552|4.0|In Guns, Germs and Steel, Jared Diamond explores the reasons why some societies have prospered and others haven't.  Why was it that Europe conquered North America and not vice-versa?  Jared shows that the causes date back to the origins of humanity.<br />The reasons Diamond describes are several but primarily focus on geography, botany and zoology, in particular the shape of the major continents and the availability of easily domesticated plants and animals.  The areas that had the proper combination had people who shifted from nomadic hunter-gatherers to sedentary farmers.<br />While this book is good, eventually Diamond repeats himself, and he hardly states anything original in the second half of the book.  Thus, while the first half is intriguing and education, the second half is redundant and tedious.  The five star quality of the first half and two star quality of the second half balances to 3.5, which I have rounded up.<br />Diamond also has something of a bias against civilizations, often referring to them sardonically as kleptocracies; on the other hand, he reveres the simpler societies and seems to lament their inevitable decline.  This slant may turn off some readers, but if you can overlook this bias, you'll find that this book is very insightful.  And if you only read half of it, that will be enough to get all you need from it.

B0000640VO|4.0|This is almost a perfect film. I'm not gonna say much about it, just that if you've spent a good deal of your life looking for \\"the one,\\" you'll understand what this movie is trying to say about this seemingly endless quest. However, despite the wonderfulness of this movie, the ending, while very romantic, is flawed. It depicts two people who have searched long and hard for each other in an effort to be loved having sex, something so carelessly base that a star has to be subtracted. One would think that the two would TALK, thus subscribing to the wills of their higher selves, not procreate in order to please their reptillian instincts. Overall, though, this movie is outstanding. If you want music that captures the same sort of warm, childish spirit, go out and buy Finally We Are No One by Mm. It's good stuff.
B00000255X|4.0|Although I don't own this particular CD, I would still recommend &quot;Bob Dylan Live 1975 (The Bootleg Series Volume 5)&quot; in it's place.  Six of the songs on the &quot;Desire&quot; CD are on the other, and from the snippets I heard here, the arrangements and the band are better on the Live CD.  Those songs, by the way, are Hurricane, Romance in Durango, One More Cup of Coffee (the Valley Below), Isis, Oh, Sister, and Sara.  Carmen Rivera performs beautifully in the live shows, but someone else (not sure who but not Joan Baez) sings the backup vocals.  Emmylou would have been nice.
B000089A06|4.0|This movie is for all of you that want the complete set of Anthony Hopkins as Lector.  While Manhunter will remain one of my all time favorite movies, Red Dragon is a very satisfying adaptation of Thomas Harris' book.  IMHO the ending and the demise of Frances Dolarhyde in Red Dragon is truer to the book ending and therefore a bit more exciting than the ending used in Manhunter.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that wants to revel in Anthony Hopkins at his best Lector moments, and of course the end of the movie setting us up for Silence of the Lambs, was cute.
B000062XGB|3.0|A widescreen print of this film has been available here for more than a year so the timing of this release is strange - perhaps USAmericans are more tolerant of TV prints than we Aussies are. The film itself is also strange. You can see why Fox bought it - a familiar but also exotic story; the world's most bankable star (CHOU Yunfat, the emperor of Hernggong) with the very marketable Jodie Foster as insurance; & a cheap Malaysian location to build a theme park of a set - but in all this clever dealmaking, noone seems to have ever bothered to decide who this Anna was supposed to be. Master Chou - a contemporary action specialist; who never did fancy dress or martial arts before Hollywood coopted him, which makes his historical martial artist casting here look very odd indeed - plays it as a romantic fantasy & looks more like a Hakkayuan Yul Brynner than the historical King Mongkut. Ms Foster - a thoughtful actor & one of my personal favorites - isn't generally cast as a romantic lead; & here seems to be trying to create a historically accurate portrayal of the woman who called herself Anna Leonowens. The mixture of styles doesn't gel; & with director Andy Tennant wanting a foot in every camp - first encouraging Foster's carefully thought out stuffiness; then filling the screen with elephant shots you last saw in old Disney True-Life Adventures - the result is a stylish mess. At one point in the commentary, Tennant compliments Foster on never appearing to sweat, even though the story is set in the tropics & she's wearing historical clothing that must have made the real Anna sweat like a pig. Clearly he didn't want a realistic take on Anna's controversial Siamese sojourn; so why did he indulge Foster's awkward realism elsewhere? Who knows? That said: in its resolutely old-fashioned story-telling, Anna plays better on a wide-screen DVD print than in the cinema; & in some striking parts rather than in the rather rambling whole. It won't sweep you away either as a romantic epic or as intimate study of a relationship that would never be; but a lot worse films have been a lot more successful.
0736041850|3.0|Propably the first thing you notice when you open the book is quality. The paper is thick and glossy and the quality of printing is good. The pictures are beautiful, and it´s easy to find exercises for a certain muscle group. <br />Then the bad news: While the pictures look great, on many occasions they are too detailed, to the point of being unclear. Every exercise is given a full page (two pages on some occasions). But the majority of a page is filled with large drawing of the exercise, with the stressed muscle groups shown. The performance of a given exercise is given far less detail, on some occasions only a few lines of text. I think it would be far more benefical to give more detailed explanation of correct performance and/or common mistakes, and print the picture a bit smaller.<br />The exercises in the book are divided on seven sections, based on which muscle group they mainly stress. This is OK, but the division of muscle groups is a bit odd. There is a separate section covering exercises for buttocs, but at the same time all other muscle groups in the leg are combined as \\"legs\\". It would be more reasonable to combine buttocs with quads, or thights, and give calves a separate section.<br />There are about 110 different exercises, and variations on some exercises. The selection of exercises is a bit odd in my opinion. For example, there is a page on seated calf raise (on a machine), and the author advises that as a variation you can do the exercise without a machine, using a barbell across your legs. Then, on the next page that very same exercise is presented as a separate exercise! And there are some basic exercises missing, like toe presses on leg press machine, for example.<br />Perhaps the main problem of the book is that it doesn´t expalain the muslce mechanics at all. It would be great if the kinesiology of given muscle group would be explained at the beginning of each chapter, but there is no explanations at all about what a given muscle does, and how it affects the whole body. For example, the book says that seated calf raise targets the soleus, but there is no explanation what this means in practice. And there is no explanation which exercise I sould use if I wanted to emphasize the outer calf, for example.<br />As a conclusion, I would say that in certain circumstances this book can be a valuable asset, but you can´t use it by itself. You need to have some books on kinesiology, and some books which describe the correct performance of each exercose in detail.
B00000ILE7|5.0|Flying in the face of public opinion, but let's give it a try.  <br />We have a modern society, in an age so technical, it's possible to set up a colony in the most distant reaches of space.  It takes hours for a radio message to reach Earth.  <br />Bad news, in this case,  would be a smarter, faster, acid blooded alien psycopath stuck in a prison with you.   <br />Worse would be discovering that in the middle of all this technology, and the aforementioned xenomorphic nightmare, you are reduced to the 21st Century equivalent of rubbing stcks together to make fire.  <br />Yeah, the language is vile - it's R rated, and set on on a futuristic prison containing the absolute dregs of society.  What d'ya expect, Barney?  Yeah, there's a lot of gore, there's some god-awful alien beastie hunting people.  <br />In my opinion, it's a tight, slick film.  Dark and depressing, offers very little in the form of a \\"nice\\" day out, but where it sets out to scare you, it's on the money.

6305364648|4.0|Director/writer brought with True Lies one of the best action films of the 90's.  When it came out, it was an escapist movie, but now it seems all to close for comfort (read on ).  But nonetheless it is a true adrealine rush of action and sharp humor and a balanced plot that involves nuclear bomb stealing terrorists and the dual part is Arnold's wife getting involved in is spy operation, very humorously.<br />The effects and stunts are eye-popping.  Jamie-Lee Curtis' stunt double dangling from a helicopter is one of the many in Lies, and anyone who knows James Cameron knows that these are something to behold.  And Arnold of course is always at the top of his game.  if you are into James Cameron and/or Arnold, True Lies should satisfy your hunger for action.
B00000099Y|5.0|What separates Tool from the rest of the bands out there is the fact that they are very down to earth. Or are they? The lyrics are metaphorically put and the lead singer, Maynard James Keenan, has made it very clear not to take anything the band says worth a grain of salt. What he does say is that you should think for yourself.<br />This album will help you. I've bought many CDs in my life time. Some I keep around just for an occaisonal listen. Some i pawn two days after buying it. And then there are those that I will keep till the day I die. Aenima is one of them. You just can't go wrong with this album.<br />1. Stinkfist - This song is so amazing. I love the intro to it because it sets the tone for the rest of the CD. Stinkfist was one of their biggest hits and Rolling Stone says (after ranking this album as #27 of the 100 most essential albums) that Stinkfist is the stand out track. I agree that it is an incredible track. I beleive however, that it is the second best track on here. 10/10<br />2. Eulogy - A very confusing song. With the lyrics here, many woudl assume that Maynard is making reference to Jesus Christ. However, it is spoken metaphorically (key word there) and can be taken anyway. As with all music that is written for the listener.... When you listen to this album, absorb it. This is one of the best Tool songs in my opinion only b/c it is so powerful. 10/10<br />3. h. - A silent hit with Tool fans. A very good song. Its hard to describe what the song is about b/c you'd have to listen to it. Then you'll understand and hopefully write a review on this record. 10/10<br />4. filler<br />5. Forty-Six &amp; Two - Awesome track. Step into your shadow and realize what this song is all about. I'm listening to it write now. Teh drums make it all that much more powerful. This is probably one of the greatest and most recognizable Tool songs out there. It should have been one of their hits, but they had label problems. Still though, this is one of the best Tool songs ever. 10/10<br />6. filler<br />7. Hooker w/ a Penis - This is the only downfall to me. This song really is away from the way I see Tool. This is like a Fred Durst song about being macho. Its still a good song. But it brings back memories of &quot;Hush&quot; off of the &quot;Opiate&quot; EP.... still good though .9/10<br />8. filler<br />9. Jimmy - Another excellent track. Maynard proves that he can write beautiful music. I love this song because it makes you wonder who Jimmy is. Very good. highly recommended. A little calmer then the rest of hte album. 10/10<br />10. Filler.<br />11. Pushit - This right here is the greatest Tool song in my opinion. I've never heard anything so incredible before. When i first heard this song, and it reached the end ot where Maynard unleashes his voice, i just fell in love with the album entirely. Its a very good song and I highly recommend the album just for this song. If you can, look for the live version of this song (which is even mroe incredible) on the Salival DVD/VHS box  set or go and download it. Its very good. 11/10<br />12. filler<br />13. Aenema - Another highly recongnizable song by Tool. This song here will be one of their classics for a long time. To me, it's one of hte most metaphorically sung tracks by Tool. Just give the disk a spin in yoru CD player. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. 10/10<br />14. filler<br />15 Third Eye - This is a very long song. But the haunting repetiion of &quot;Prying open my third eye&quot; just does something to me. It makes me realize just how blind many of us are to the world around us. Thats what this band is all about folks. Its not about selling records and its not about winning awards. Its about releasing yourself and letting go of what you perceive to be reality. Because there is a whole other world out there. 10/10<br />Please don't just go off of my words when you buy this record. Don't let those that think its a commercial band (far from it) sour your expectations of Tool.True 3 out of 4 records are Parental Advisory CDs, but they are well worth your time. I guarantee that if you are sick of the pop music and sick of the sellouts, then you'll feel right at home when you put Aenima in your discman. It won't click the first time though. Not until you let yourself go and become comfortable. This record will be in my collection till the day I die.<br />make the right decision. &quot;Pushit&quot; did it for me. now i will always have this record.<br />thanks<br />Timf Tool.

0446608955|5.0|This book is so wonderful! I saw the movie a couple times before reading the book and I really enjoyed it. And then a couple weeks ago at an airport I found the book and bought it right away. I had it finished two days later and it is simply one of the best books that I have ever read! Now I am very disappointed in the movie. I can't believe they had the nerve to make the movie but not even make it at all like the book. They are completely different and I would most definitely recommend the book over the movie anyday.
B0000797IO|3.0|A cotton-candy-ish film that gets a big rise while it's underway, but vanishes like a wisp the moment it's over.  I thought that Jennifer Aniston, playing a white trash gal trapped in her numbingly shabby small-town life, did a good job breaking away from her well-known role as Rachael, on TV's &lt;i>Friends.&lt;/i> I also enjoyed her supporting cast as well, particularly John C. Reilly as her clueless but well-meaning stoner husband, and I got all wrapped up in knots as the plot got ickier and more uncomfortable.  But the resolution was skillful and nuanced only by Hollywood's standards, and the emotional coil-up dissipates almost instantaneously.  Even while the film gives a glimpse into middle America which is pretty close to the mark, it's also condescending and in many regards heartless.  I suppose that's the point: Aniston's is an antiheroic role, and the film gains points by creating a new set of easy answers that run counter to the same-old movie cliches, but which have the same general impact on its audience.  This was OK, but not great.
6305350205|3.0|Star Trek V has always been noted as the worst of the entire Star Trek franchise, and yes, I too, once considered it an awful film, but after having seen it again, I can't help but feel it's not nearly the worst (Star Trek III: The Search for Spock), though certainly far, far from the best (Star Trek: First Contact). If there's one thing I'll give this entry credit for, it's that it has the most absurdly fascinating premise of the whole series. <br />Ok, I realize summing the film up by stating it's about an eccentric Vulcan searching for God might sound kind of silly, and it certainly is, but for me, just hearing the premise fuels all sorts of ideas in my head, sparks thoughts of the limitless posibilities of the universe and the imagination, and really, isn't that what Star Trek is all about? In The Final Frontier's case, the concept alone is enough to attain my interest.<br />Delivery is a completely different story. This is where the movie stumbles, and often quite badly. As all Trek fans know, this is the one movie in the series directed by William Shatner himself. What he obviously aspired to do was not only to create a popcorn adventure filled with action and humor, but also to infuse themes of spirituality and the wondrous possibilities of the unknown. Sounds like a great odyssey, I know, and while I'm sure some Trek fans will be fully satisfied with the film, I can't help but feel a little frustrated.<br />For starters, the opening segment set on Yosemite while the crew is on shore leave is one of the weakest extended scenes of the series. We get lame attempts at humor, totally unconvcing special effects (Spock's Superman-ish rescue of Kirk), and some rather pathetic bits of dialogue. Things finally get moving when the Enterprise sets out on its rescue mission, after they've discovered that a Vulcan named Sybok has taken three ambassadors hostage and is demanding a starship. This leads to a skirmish set on the desert planet of Nimbus III, a rather poorly choreographed action sequence that clearly shows where Shatner's directing talents don't lie. <br />Oddly enough, it's also very noticeable that the special effects are weaker than the previous entries. Hell, even the tinting is a little bland; the movie actually looks more dated than its immediate predecessor, The Voyage Home. At least Shatner wisely decided to focus more on the characters' situation than on the effects themselves. And that is probably where the enjoyment of the next forty or so minutes originate. I've never much cared for the supporting cast, but Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley make for arguably the most entertaining trio in cinematic history. All three share more screentime together here than in any of the other films, and watching them bicker and/or work together is an absolute delight (loved the conversations they had while in the brig). <br />Simultaneously, it's not hard to notice the blatant plot holes. How exactly can the Enterprise arrive at the center of the Galaxy (where God supposedly lies beyond The Great Barrier) in a matter of hours? Why would Sybok \\"brainwash\\" everyone except for Kirk? Why would Spock question if Sybok found Shakara when it's obvious he couldn't have since he's hijacked the Enterprise to search for it? Most infuriatingly, the plot is never fully or even adequately explained and explored. Sybok (who, I might add, is played very enjoyably by Laurence Luckinbill) claims to have received a vision from God, but this is never elaborated on. Did what they eventually find beyond The Great Barrier send him this vision or was he simply delusional? <br />Once they arrive at The Great Barrier, the suspense heightens quite a bit. That joyous, exhilarating sense of wonder swelled in me, boosted by Jerry Goldsmith's wonderful score (arguably the best of the series). What they do discover on the planet isn't necessarily disappointing. \\"It\\" makes for an interesting discovery to the end of an ambitious journey and makes some sense, given that you can accept that they could conveniently stand on the right spot for \\"it\\" to reveal itself. Once again, more elaboration on \\"it\\" would have been nice. <br />The very abrupt conclusion is what's ultimately unsatisfactory, more exploration on that planet and its purpose would have been nice. The climax is pretty much a disappointment, a deus ex machina that wraps things up too neatly and in a far too cliched fasion. The more I think about it, the more I would have liked that Klingon enemy subplot completely excised, since it only serves to detract attention from the \\"quest,\\" and also as a copout for the conclusion. <br />The Final Frontier has several things going for it: the unswerving chemistry of the three leads, Jerry Goldsmith's exemplary score, and the occasional sense of awe that the best of science fiction achieve. But the story is too muddled, too silly and Shatner's direction is too unfulfilling. As far as popcorn adventures go, it's a middling, half-bad outing.<BR>** 1/2 out of *****

B0000004V2|4.0|I missed this one's significance at the time of it's release, even though I owned it for a while without really listening to it.  Most of us have been guilty of it at one point or another, and I've got my share of skeletons.<br />By the time the Roses got around to recording their sporadically brilliant sophomore album (4 years too late), their time had passed, but not before they released their debut; it's the pinnacle of the Brit-Pop, Manchester scene in the year '89, and with good reason.  It's a solid pop album.<br />The album starts off strong with both \\"I Wanna Be Adored\\", and \\"She Bangs The Drums\\", continues mid-way with \\"Made of Stone\\", \\"Sugar Spun Sister\\", then peaks with \\"I Am The Resurrection\\" (some editions fail to contain \\"Fool's Gold\\" for some reason).

B00005JL78|5.0|I can't believe some of the bad reviews for this film.  Yes, just about any film that explores time, time travel, the future, etc. is going to have flaws in logic.  It is impossible to travel through time, change the future, etc.  If you think about it too much, you can always come up with a flaw.  If the flaws require deep thought and don't just leap at you as obvious, I have no problem suspending my disbelief and going with where the storyteller wants to take me.<br />Spielberg tells a great story here. I won't rehash the plot, but let's just say that not only is the story a zinger, but there are lots of great scenes.  My favorite was the scene when Cruise is hiding out in a VERY sleazy apartment, waiting for his transplanted eyes to heal, and the cops release these electronic \\"spiders\\" that can get into just about any place and then they find people and scan their retinas.  The sweeping camera work, as though the whole complex had been cut into a cross section, was absolutely terrific.  In about two minutes, we get the entire social / political climate that now exists in this country at the time of the movie, at least for the poor.  And it is suspenseful.<br />The empaths are very creep creations, lying in their pool forever and ever. When Cruise awakens and steals one of them, the movie takes a very interesting turn, as we see the world through the eyes of this empath, Agatha, who has a hard time telling if what she is seeing is the present or the future.  Samantha Morton plays her, and she DESERVES AN OSCAR NOMINATION, ASAP!  She is reviting.<br />Colin Farrell makes for a cool adversary for the hot-tempered Cruise.  Max VonSydow is terrific as Cruise's mentor...he has such a great voice.  And Cruise, who has never been one of my favorite actors, is very good in this...one of his best.  He keeps himself from overacting in most scenes, and doesn't seem too self-conscious about looking good or charming.  <br />The whole vision of a not too distant future, coupledwith some great scenes of suspense, good performances and even a tear-jerking moment or two make this one of the best movies of the year, and certainly the best sci-fi of the year.  I highly recommend it!

B00005UKKH|5.0|I am sure anybody considering buying Bullitt is familiar with the plot, so I'll refrain from describing that. This is a great movie because Steve McQueen is a cool as he's ever been, the sunshine and light is as nice as it comes in SF, and the cars are as tough and politically incorrect as they come. Steve McQueen is the white knight fighting known crooks, unknown crooks and of course his own (intimidated and shortsighted) bosses. Yet, the number one reason why this is a cult-movie is of course the car-chase. Many movie-creators have tried to copy the Bullitt car-chase, but none have even come close. Anybody with the slightest interest in cars will enjoy the scene, and it is close to Nirvana on Earth for those with a heart for sixties muscle cars and thundering V8's. Click on the link and order a copy today! Then you can sit back, turn up the sound and feel the goose bumps rise on your back when Steve McQueen fires up his Mustang and roams the streets of San Francisco.
067101756X|2.0|I read the other online reviews and decided to spring for the book.  While well written, some things jump right out at me.  Corso was a career 'militarian' so his opinions appear to come from one angle.  What raised doubts in my mind with regards to this book is that there is indeed so much 'dis'-information out there that you don't know who to trust anymore.  I can't visualize the wimpy guy in the picture walking into the office of a CIA officer and mkaing threats.  Corso insists that visitors mean us(U.S & the world) harm.  Yet, in all his wisdom, fails to realize that harm could very well have been done when we were not in a position to defend ourselves.  Any rational mind should come to this conclusion, no matter how long one has been fighting wars.  Read Alien Agenda.  The section on Remote Viewing is very interesting.
B000002NFM|5.0|The Fat Of The Land is one the of the best albems out there,all 10 tracks are godlike,..i have been a fan of the prodigy,sents there lp \\"what evil lurks\\".Its fun to see a underground breakbeat/jungle group,turn into Hardsound/rave...You should give the prodigy big props for what they have done for the seen,and music of techno today,still making music.They have made a new sound that will stay with music for some time.And some day be grandfathers of techno style~
B000002H72|5.0|The line that sums up the Pixies best is \\"often imitated, never duplicated.\\" Just listen to Nirvana, Weezer, ..And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead, Bush, and countless other bands, then listen to any track on this album. The quiet-loud-quiet dynamics, the guitar and bass lines-- it's as if the Pixies, in their 5-year existence, singlehandedly established the blueprint for '90s alternative rock.<br />Kurt Cobain himself said that Smells Like Teen Spirit was his attempt to write a Pixies song, and Nevermind was his Doolittle. While Nevermind certainly was a good album, I'll take the Pixies' second album over Nevermind anyday.<br />The best way to describe the Pixies' sound is to take hardcore punk, 50's surf music and pop, throw in some Talking Heads and Sonic Youth, and mix thoroughly. Even that description does not do justice to how wonderfully weird this band sounds.<br />Black Francis is a phenomenal vocalist. His Spanish-accented voice goes from a hushed whisper to a throat-ripping scream in the drop of a hat. Kim Deal's backing vocals are subtly haunting and beautiful and add just the right amount of honey to Francis' vinegar. Joey Santiago lays down some of the most distinctive riffs I've ever heard, while drummer David Lovering pounds away with intensity.<br />The music? Inspired. There's not a weak track to be had here: The Un Chien Andalou-inspired Debaser; the hush-to-scream Tame (my personal favorite); the surfy Wave Of Mutilation; the string-accompanied environmental commentary of Monkey Gone To Heaven; the kooky faux-reggae opener of Mr. Grieves--I could go on and on. The lyrics are so good you'll be singing them in your sleep.<br />If you have any taste in alternative music, you should buy this album and its predescessor, the abrasive but brilliant Surfer Rosa, right away. Highly, highly recommended.
B0000797IO|4.0|This new type of vehicle for Jennifer Aniston- a serious movie- brought out the best in this actress. From the minute she first appears on the screen, she brilliantly conveys the monotony of Justine's life, married to a pot-smoking loser and working in a boring dead-end job at Retail Rodeo. Aniston's facial expressions and even her posture contribute to the overall picture of the never-ending sameness of her character's life.<br />\\"The Good Girl\\" is a terrific character study. We see a young woman trapped in a life that she has fallen into....we just know that she married Phil out of sheer inertia many years ago and that nothing has changed since.<br />Justine is living a life of \\"quiet desperation\\" when she encounters Holden and they are drawn to each other. The viewer knows right away, as I think Justine does also, that no good can come of this, but she ventures forth anyway. What follows is a movie that does not follow all the rules and is anything but routine.<br />Good viewing!
B000002MY3|2.0|... \\"You Outta Know\\" and hail Alanis Morissette as the goddess hero icon of the voice of females everywhere. I hate how that song has been turned into some man-bashing anthem. The song sounds like the whiny rantings of some jilted immature high school girl who was probably dumped because she deserved it. The dangerous psychotic ramblings of the song conjure up images of some unattractive,  mentally-disturbed female who was dumped and now she's stalking the guy she had an unhealthy obsession and fixation with in the first place. ... With the exception of a few other tracks on the cd that are okay, but only because radio played them to death and drilled them into my head, this cd is overrated and a big so what in my books. ... On the whole i found it pretty unremarkable and i didn't think she could sing that well anyway. I enjoyed her first two cds she put out BEFORE all this Jagged Little Pill hype. She used to do cool pop dance tunes and actually had a pretty good voice before going off into acoustic half sing/half talk/half screech territory. Now she's just talking and screaming over an accoustic guitar and a drum beat. How original. ... I changed my mind. This cd rates one star.

B000003TA4|4.0|Let's get a few things straight here folks: Nirvana was not the best band on the planet (Kurt would've told you that himself), and Nevermind is not their best work. In Utero blows this entire album away in depth, and the raw, honest Steve Albini production on In Utero overshadows the overly slick Butch Vig production of this album.<br /><br />The song structures borrowed considerably from a long-overlooked band, the Pixies. Kurt even said in interviews that Smells Like Teen Spirit swiped quite a bit from Debaser (off of the Pixies' second album Doolittle). In addition you can hear strains of other Seattle bands such as The Melvins and Mudhoney, and also the noisy rock of Sonic Youth.<br /><br />Also notable as a Nirvana influence is Killing Joke. In fact, the band was sued for nicking the riff of Killing Joke's \\"Eighties\\" on Come As You Are.<br /><br />So, is Nevermind an entirely original recording? No. Is it an important album, though? Yes! Before Nevermind: Michael Jackson, MC Hammer, Madonna, Bon Jovi. After Nevermind: Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins. Nevermind was instrumental in bringing alternative rock to mainstream acceptance. It also resulted in the pallid state of today's commericial radio with bands like Staind, Nickelback, Bush, and Puddle Of Mudd, so let's take that claim with a grain of salt.<br /><br />As for the music? There are the obvious hits like Smells Like Teen Spirit, Lithium, Come As You Are, and In Bloom, but also some decent songs that avoided the mainstream radar (Polly, Something In The Way, On A Plain, Territorial Pissings). Overall though, Nevermind isn't as strong as Pearl Jam's Ten or Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger, which were both released in the same year.<br /><br />If you think that Nevermind is the only essential Nirvana release, I advise you to go out and buy In Utero--this is the only studio album that does Nirvana justice. Follow that up with Unplugged In NY and Insecticide. Also, you should strongly consider two Pixies albums: Surfer Rosa and Doolittle.er Rosa and Doolittle.
B000003TA4|5.0|I remember when Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains set off this Grunge Movement. It felt like something was different. I mean these bands made unbelieveable, heartfelt, tragic, music straight from the soul. Nothing was contrived and manufactured about it. This album really was and still is a breath of fresh air in rock music history. Songs like &quot;Breed&quot; and &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; will leave you amazed. My favorite song here is &quot;Come As You Are&quot;, because of the mysterious riffs and basslines. It has such a melancholy feel to it. Kurt Cobain was a unique frontman indeed. Mysterious lyrics and unique voice make this band legendary. The power drumming of Dave Grohl is fantastic and the booming bass riffs of Krist Novoselic is great (Check out his new band Eyes Adrift with Bud of Sublime/Long Beach Dub Allstars and the singer song writter of Meat Puppets).  I originally got into Eyes Adrift when I learned that the Dub Allstars had split up, and Eric formed Long Beach Shortbus, and Bud started his band with Krist.  Anyways, glad that all the guys from those bands are still out there creating great music.
B00000DGUG|1.0|Truthfully, i find Alanis Morissette to be one of the most overhyped, overrated females in music today. I don't care that she has a new cd out called Under Rug Swept which all the fans are gushing over. That song Hands Clean was one of the most overplayed songs on FM radio that summer it was released. What many of her fans seem to forget is that long before she came out with Jagged Little Pill, and long before she started putting her last name on her cds, she was simply known as Alanis and was doing clever and original-sounding dance pop that was fun and exciting, not angry self-absorbed, whiny trips to the psychiatrist's couch, which is what most of her songs now are. Back then she had two excellent dance cds and a promising career as a pop artist. PLUS, check out the photos in the cd booklets of those two early dance cds and you'll see a totally different-looking Alanis. You wouldn't believe the way she used to look. Gorgous as hell, compaired to the dog she is now.  She looked NOTHING like she does now. Man, she was a total babe back then, compared to the way she looks now with her long greasy-looking hair plastered to her head that looks in need of a good shampoo. If you saw the sensual way she used to look you'd think she was just a victim of being lazy about her appearance now.  She totally abandoned her dance pop roots in favor of doing songs that are half  singing and mostly talking over an acoustic guitar riff, with barely any of the lyrics rhyming. I mean the song where she is reading the unsent letters written to her different ex-boyfriends is beyond stupid! She might as well open up the phone book and half read/half sing the names and phone numbers and it would be just as interesting. How about putting in some words that rhyme now and then, Alanis?Otherwise you just come off as some self-indulgent, self-absorbed artsy fartsy who thinks the world wants to hear about all the guys you dated and failed miserably with. I hope Madonna's record company, Maverick, drops you eventually for boring and frustrating us with your whiny rantings. If you're the best Canada has to offer in the music industry then i'm ashamed to say i live in Canada. Go back to the 90s and stay there.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|I heard this album today and can't really say much one way or another. It's pop dance stuff which is usually all the same anyhow. This is no real exception.  The songs are admittedly catchy though I believe I would go crazy if I heard them too many times.<br />The entire time I was listening to the album I was looking for pics of them online. Yeah, they're hot. Would they even be here if they weren't? Probably not.<br />I will give them credit for pushing the whole lesbian thing though I'm not too sure it isn't just simple marketing. Are they really even gay? I guess I'll know in five years when the career is over and the porn's out.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Folks, Just so you know, \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" was released after \\"Snatch\\", and the ONLY cast member that stars in the two movies is Brad Pitt (that's it).  ...and the role Pitt plays in this movie is nowhere near the role he plays in \\"Ocean's Eleven\\".  If you ask me, this role is better.<br />The movie is great.  plain and simple.  Enjoy it, and you may have to watch it more than once to get everything that is going on.  It is definitely worth purchasing.

B00006IS85|4.0|The D-VHS version of this film is lusciously filled with the subtleties of light that will test the best of big screens--and this D-VHS version of Entrapment is a near perfect print.

Scotland to Asia (was it Singapore or Hong Kong), are \\"spot on.\\"  Beautifully shot film on our newest most detailed medium--D-VHS.  Clearly, undoubtedly better than DVD quality images.  Big screen owners will love it's detail, but a word of warning: you need to have a D-VHS machine that plays \\"D-Theatre.\\"  Unfortunately, there's still some disagreement amongst the movie houses regarding d vhs formats, thus, not all d vhs machines are \\"d theatre\\" certified.  Can't wait for more films to be released of this quality on d vhs--it's truly like getting a director's print for your own home big screen.
B000000HTM|5.0|Where contemporary music is concerned, there has never been and will never be a shortage of superficial insights. Happily, \\"Pawn Hearts\\" will never be put into that category. Next to this music and these lyrics, \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" looks like a glossy, dance-oriented pop tune. And a lame one at that.<br />VDGG and Hammill deliver some of their most serious and personal music and lyrics about the human condition. The unity of verbal and musical phrasing is singular in its sense of purpose, separating this record for many, many pretenders. This is the real deal. The sense of alienation is genuine. And its purpose is a simple one: to get you to wake up.<br />From a myriad of images and ideas about conformity, identity, lost opportunity and the purpose of, and notions about, the self, \\"Pawn Hearts\\" strives to prod you into some level of awareness about your own existence and how you might relate to the world around you. The perpetually disturbed and unsettled music rarely finds a moment of calm or reflection. All is tumult, struggle and groping. Yet somewhere in the middle of \\"A Plague of Lighthousekeepers\\" Hammill manages to sum up all our lives in less than 10 lines.<br />The word play is second to none because it is charged with meaning: \\"Lighthouses might house the key\\", or the ending lines \\"all things are apart ... all things are a part\\" do more to unsettle than settle whatever it is you think you believe. Listening to this music will not necessarily offer you answers, but it will compel you to pay much closer attention to the questions.
B00006J3T4|5.0|It is anyone's guess as to whether the former Dire Straits crooner and guitarist \\"still gets chicks for free\\", but Ragpicker's Dream, the third of three brilliant solo albums released in the wake of Mark Knopfler's former band, proves that he doesn't get money for nothin'. Despite the speckles of genius Knopfler bestowed upon the music world with Dire Straits, the gritty, stylish honesty of recent solo albums such as Golden Heart, Sailing to Philadelphia and his latest release suggest that his old band's demise was a fortuitous event for rock `n roll. The break up facilitated Knopfler's much-needed escape from the glaring spotlight under which he was cast after the monumentally successful Brothers in Arms. Never has Knopfler demonstrated such eagerness to explore more varied musical terrain as on the solo albums that ensued, from the fluttering fiddles and bagpipes of Golden Heart to the impassioned acoustic blues of Ragpicker's Dream.<br />Most fans came to expect a certain sound from Dire Straits; the instantly captivating guitar licks and shuffling rhythm of \\"Money For Nothing\\" or \\"Sultans of Swing,\\" the chiming organ of \\"Walk of Life,\\" or the jangling hooks of `So Far Away.\\" However, the Dire Straits oeuvre is a rather inconsistent one, including only a couple albums of sustained energy and a host of lesser collections ranging from decent to dismal. The conventional boundaries that confined Dire Straits ultimately became so exhausted that the band had nowhere left to turn. 1991's On Every Street, the band's farewell album, showcased Knopfler's increasing enthusiasm for, among other sounds, the twang and wail of Nashville, playing with country legend Chet Atkins as well as the Notting Hillbillies. The days of MTV videos and duets with Sting were clearly a thing of the distant past.  Any further projects with Dire Straits would only have typecast a talent whose borders stretch well beyond rock `n roll's tired roads.<br />When not recording solo, Knopfler is lending a hand on projects by performers as artistically opposed to his pop-rock past as Waylon Jennings, whose final album, Closing in on the Fire, features a ballad to which Knopfler contributes a guitar solo. On his own work, though, such nods to Nashville are becoming more average than anomalous, particularly on his latest outing, speckled with everything from rock to ragtime. The album's track list, including titles like `Daddy's Gone to Nashville\\" and \\"Hillfarmer's Blues,\\" reads more like a list of lost songs by Dock Boggs, the late, Appalachian banjo-master. While some of the songs on Ragpicker's Dream might have gotten Boggs's toe tapping, though, Knopfler's homage to J.J Cale remains evident. Brooding, slick guitar solos emerge throughout the album, from the frenetic licks of the sprawling opener and single, \\"Way Aye Man\\" to more languid, bluesy tunes such as the title track.<br />It is the album's innovative production, however, that proves it a necessary conclusion to Knopfler's solo trilogy. Compared to the somewhat bland, spare arrangements of his previous album, the flavorful production of Ragpicker's Dream serves as a refreshing taste of Knopfler's endless musical dexterity. Sprightly and deeply textured, the soundscapes of songs like \\"You Don't Know Your Bones\\" and \\"Coyote\\" teem with bass, flickering drum beats, horns, percussion and Knopfler's sly guitar. Hearing the result is like getting lost in the middle of a feral jungle at night.  Knopfler's production is crisp, clear and variegated, making for a potpourri of songs that are at once spare and abundantly rich, as the haunting, folkish \\"Fare Thee Well Northumberland\\" gives way to \\"Daddy's Gone to Nashville,\\" a blithe and thoroughly convincing tribute to Hank Williams.<br />A consistent thrust of melody renders Ragpicker's Dream Knopfler's most gorgeous and tactful project to date. The sudden, snapping drums that guide \\"Hill Farmer's Blues\\" to its fading crescendo raise the song's beauty to an etherealpitch, while \\"Devil Baby\\" delivers a steady pathos accompanied by an insouciant musical backdrop and Knopfler's earthy, dust-caked vocals. \\"It's hard to find love anywhere/hard to find love anywhere,\\" he laments on one of the album's many moving ballads. With the onslaught of gaudy, vapid and overproduced pop singles cluttering today's airwaves, Mark Knopfler's enduring commitment to raw, honest and rootsy music is nothing short of a miracle. While it may very well be hard to find love anywhere, albums like Ragpicker's Dream guarantee the love of those who feel alienated by the fluff that passes for \\"rock\\" in an industry becoming more subversive and superficial by the hour.eal pitch, while \\"Devil Baby\\" delivers a steady pathos accompanied by an insouciant musical backdrop and Knopfler's earthy, dust-caked vocals. \\"It's hard to find love anywhere/hard to find love anywhere,\\" he laments on one of the album's many moving ballads.

B00002Z88D|4.0|I have long regarded Metallica as the most 'musical' rock band I have ever heard.  This album proves this without a doubt.  Anyone who doesn't like this album either doens't expand their musical horizons often, or is not listening carefully.  It is an absolutley fantastic album!  Every song is beautifully mixed with the top notch San Fransisco symphony orchestra.  You would think that such a wierd combination wouldn't work, but it does more than just work!  It flows with musical life like I have never heard.  Almost every single one of these metallica songs are played better than ever before.  This, my friends, is what music is all about.  No question that this is the best live album out there.  Please, buy this.  You will enjoy it, unless you are one of the closed minded individuals who do not listen to music unless it is a certain type.  This is a musical experience not to be missed!  it gets a 97 percent!  I would do anything to have been in that orchestra...

B00006M183|2.0|its ok to compare riot act to binaural because riot act sounds like all the tracks that slowed binaural down. with riot act, there is no stand out song. and no WELL WRITTEN rock songs or pop songs. i dont know why pearl jam even bothered releasing a single for this record, since there are no identifiable singles. that may work for some bands, like radiohead, but a rock record needs hooks, which are painfully absent from riot act. this just feels like an uninspired album. nothing new, just rehashed pearl jam filler.
0451191153|5.0|I feel the purpose of reading is to be challenged: ideologically, philosophically, politically, etc.  Either those challenges will cause one to rethink one's beliefs or strengthen one's existing convictions.  Either of these outcomes will produce, I believe, a better person - a thinker who is willing to encounter more than one argument, one side to any issue, and still retain opinions of one's own.  <br />I would also like to counter some of the comments that the book is simply a thinly veiled treatise on Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism.  If anyone read the introduction written by Rand she answers a fundamental question:<br />   &quot;Was The Fountainhead written for the purpose of presenting my philosophy? ... This is the motive and purpose of my writing; the projection of the ideal man ... My purpose, first cause and prime motive is the portrayal of Howard Roark as an end in himself.&quot;<br />What I understood from Rand's statement is that her ultimate goal is to present her characters - showing, through their actions and inactions, attitudes and convictions - and the good and bad points of their diverse perspectives on life.  In interpreting the book, I feel one should focus on how one perceives the characters, not on what the afterward by Leonard Peikoff or any other outside source espouses.<br />Form your own opinion of the philosophical ideas expressed in the book - do not rely on Piekoff's interpretation or the interpretation of this review or others.  Read the book and analyze the characters on your own - pull from them what grabs at you - what relates to any of your life experiences.  To me, that is the most effective way to think and read.  Think critically and scrutinize closely and you will not fail to learn from most every part of life.<br />This is how I approached the novel and I was not disappointed.

B00000I8NC|4.0|Plenty has been said about Godspeed, but this ep was a breakthrough, and remains critical in the body of modern music.  Neo-classical instrumentation and construction of the pieces (ie, left to right instead of verse chorus verse) make you feel like you're listening to the soundtrack to the end of the world, which may not be far away if George W Bush gets his way.<br />The politics of this band are important, even though they'll claim not to represent a single view (which, comprised of 9 members, I'm sure they don't).  Even so, check out their interviews and website for hints on ideology, and you'll see how the music fits their doomsaying.<br />Others find this depressing, I find it uplifting.
B00006RAKP|3.0|I love &quot;Sir&quot; Elton, ( if one must) I have all of Elton's greatest hit's and this is an awesome CD, But I just wish we could get to some REAL re-mastering! Anyone with good audio equipment can relate! Is there ever going to be a STANDARD to CD recording with a minimum &quot;BIT&quot; recording...
B00005JLSC|5.0|It was interesting to note that the vast majority of the audience at the screening I attended was at least middle-aged--people (like me) who grew up on lavish Hollywood musicals and who were not one bit disappointed by this film.<br />A beautifully styled production, with razor-sharp editing and rewardingly good performances across the board, the film owes a great deal to Dennis Potter whose groundbreaking Pennies From Heaven and The Singing Detective used startling and unexpected musical numbers to embellish his often somber plots. The treat in this film is its energy and the discovery that John C. Reilly has a wonderful tenor voice to accompany his always reliable acting talent. Richard Gere is delightful as the venal lawyer and Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart is coltishly appealing. But Zeta-Jones finally shows us, once and for all, what she can do. And it's a whole lot: she sings and dances up a storm in a part she makes entirely her own. The bonus is Queen Latifah who is just plain great.<br />For a feel-good evening, with lots of laughs and a soundtrack that had all those middle-agers dancing up the aisles as the credits rolled, don't miss this. It's time very well spent.<BR>Most highly recommended.
B000002KXV|5.0|If you love pop/jazz/rock music, then you should have this album cause every song on this album is unforgettable, so unforgettable it could've been another Steely Dan, it is twice as good compared to Gaucho (Steely Dan's final album before they split). I.G.Y. is the most successful track on this album and I'll never forget one day when I was walking inside the mall with a friend of mine from school and I told her about that song and hopefully she'll get into it, and it was the album's only U.S. Top 40 single, hitting #26. Green Flower Street is a little fast paced but it's another song to relax to, Ruby Baby is a remake from a 1950's hit and that song is about love obsession and it reminds me of this one girl who I haven't seen since elementary school and I only got to know her for about 5 months or so but life goes on. Maxine is a tale about high school lost love and it is one of the more emotional songs on the album. New Frontier (the album's other single) is one of the album's best songs and you probably remember the video. The Nightfly (which is the album's title track) is about a deejay who works for WJAZ. The Goodbye Look is a Cuban sounding song and it reminds me of pina colada. Walk Between Raindrops is the shortest track on the album and probably the album's fastest song.<BR>If you love Steely Dan, then you should get this album, it's very good, so good that if I wanted to get stranded on a desert island, I would definitely bring it with me and you wanna know how I got interested with this album...LISTENING TO IT AT WORK!<BR>This album should've been more successful than other artists like Hall &amp; Oates, Toto and Stray Cats.

0786867973|5.0|This is a fabulous book that inspires creativity in the kitchen.  Most of my hardcover cookbooks qualify as a good read but don't make it off the bedstand. This one has hardly been out of the kitchen.<br />I really enjoy Nigella's writing style.  She uses the most evocative words to describe food.  Also the production process is unfussy and for some of the yeast bakery she offers practical tips that make the whole matter of raising dough easier to fit into the rest of your life.  The pictures show food that looks good but isn't so perfect it might be plastic.<br />While some English recipes don't work very well with Australian ingredients, I've had great success with Nigella's recipes and I will be trying many more.

Yes, their computer rendering is spectacular; I felt that I could actually feel Sully's fur or feel the cold of the blizzard!  Yes, their characters are fully developed.  Yes, this movie contains all sight gags we have come to depend on from Pixar.  But in the end, it's the story that counts and I (in my fifties) still get choked up at the ending.<br />Even if you were to only watch the movie once, the additional short features, games, outtakes, and background features will keep you entertained for many, many hours.

0345349571|4.0|I must admit up front that about half way through this thick book of history I gave up.  I will freely admit that I am often a lazy reader, but it isn't that I have never made it through a long book before.  My problem, it seems to me, is that Tuchman keeps this book totally accurate, without fail it seems.  There are tidbits and facts and dates and quotes.  There seems to be little, if any, conjecture, and perhaps that is as it should be, but as a casual reader, fascinated by the time period, I couldn't bring myself to work hard enough to continue through to the end.<br />I was glued to the page when she tackles the subject of \\"Youth and Chivalry\\" and found the explanation of how marriages of the time were arranged and how infidelity was justified to be my favorite part of what I read.  It seems that with marriage coming at such a young age and being arranged by others, that to have a relationship with one's \\"true love\\" it must by definition come outside the scope of one's marriage, which was an establishment set up for the duty of family and the production of heirs.  The place children fit into the society of the time was another facet I found very intriguing.<br />This book, of course, covers Black Death, Kings, Popes, wars and battles and all kinds of foreign entanglements  There is probably some topic here that would interest any reader that wants to delve into the period.  For this reason I do recommend this book for those that are so compelled, but I do so with the caveat that it is not easy or light reading.
6304698623|5.0|Or:  Griffith goes Girl Power.  In the history of film, a handful of pictures stand out for the jaw-dropping, revolutionary power of the vision that their directors brought to the screen.  Think of \\"Napoleon\\", \\"The Scarlet Empress\\", \\"Citizen Kane\\", \\"Breathless\\", \\"2001\\".  Alfonso Cuaron brings the same intensity to bear in his production of \\"A Little Princess\\", creating a masterpiece whose stampeding procession of set pieces knocks the viewer to the floor .  Awash in blazing light, burnished golds, and vernal greens, the film's mystical India and menacingly enchanted New York create an intoxicating atmosphere for the Blakean story of a little girl horribly lost in an unforgiving world once she is bereft of her beloved father.  Young Sara's gifts for imagination and compassion war against Miss Minchon's brutish system of materialism and grinding practicality in a story that is accessible to children but offers higher truths for the adult.  The screenplay, awash in references to the \\"Ramayana\\" and with hints of pantheistic intuition, compliments the Shelleyan Romanticism of the visuals.  Cuaron and his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki achieve a kind of pictorial radiance matched only by the Bertolucci of \\"Little Buddha\\" and \\"Beseiged\\".  The incisive editing, the soaring cranes, create an exhilarating sense of wonder:  the unbelievable audacity of the scene in which Sara consoles a little girl hurls us over any objection to the sentimentality  by sheer creative authority-- the swooning poetry of the images and words forces our belief.  Long before the famous Snow Scene, the viewer is wheeling over with  intoxication at the beauty of this film.  Shot by shot, this is the most perfectly realized example of sheer rapture in the cinematic canon.  Simply the greatest film of the '90s.
1586210661|4.0|I really liked this book,for a few reasons. One It was written really well. And two it was hilarously funny. His discription was also very good. I usually read fanasty and I thought this would be some stupid book that every one was telling me to read. But i was proved wrong by the fist chapter. My favorite chapter was \\"You can't kill the Rooster\\". The way his brother acts, I thought that it was really funny. <BR>    I was wondering throughout the book whether the book is true or he just used his name for the main character. I would recomend this book to any one who likes to laugh...a lot
B000003S0P|5.0|You would still love that you hate this album.<br />Progressive rocks pioneers show their true colors again. This album cooks! unbelievably talented as they always are and have been King Crimson and the dream team that made up this particular lineup of Bruford, Fripp, Wetton, Cross and dominated 1973 and 1974 with Larks Tounges In Aspic, Starless and Bible Black, and ofcourse Red.<br />This album is so well rounded and unique it beats description under any &quot;one&quot; lable. King Crimson are certifiably one of the most intricatly critiqued bands you will ever try to describe ;)... Have fun owning this album and at the same time, trying at all for a decent interpretation of this fusion, jazz, rock, metal album. Hybird as it gets... Listen to Fallen Angel and be left weary with this monsterous rock classic.
B00000IAU3|5.0|When I was first introduced to Dido, the person who put the cd in the player handed me the lyrics and I started reading.  \\"This is depressing\\" came to mind while I was reading the words, \\"she's got issues\\" was what I was thinking.  \\"My lovers gone, his boots no longer by my door\\" and other lines at first gave me the wrong impression of this album.<br />Yes, there are some depressing type songs, and some pain here, too.  She sings of her ex lover, leaving her for some other women, \\"I hear she spreads her sweet honey\\" and that in fact she was with your best friend last night, hah!...Actually it's a fun song and catchy too.<br />But the two best songs, in my opinion, are wonderful love songs, those two being the \\"Thank you\\" track and the final track \\"Take my Hand\\".  One of these has been played like crazy on the radio, but I don't recall if I have heard the final track on the air.  It is truly a lovely and beautiful song and I think the best song on the entire album.<br />I once started playing this in my mom's garage and when she and her best friend came outside, they couldn't help but ask \\"who is that woman?\\", her voice is so noticeable; it's strong and powerful yet also soft and sexy at the same time.<br />I strongly recommend this cd, it doesn't have any \\"skip over\\" songs, it's sad and happy both and really easy to listen to over and over.
B000001DYA|5.0|When people say that this is one of the noisiest, heaviest, most ear splitting, skull smashing rock albums ever recorded, for the love of all that is holy, LISTEN TO THEM! If you play this too loud you're almost guaranteed ear damage. And make sure you have some good speakers before you crank this monster. I can't even imagine what people thought about this in 1968. By this time folks thought that Hendrix, Cream and The Yardbirds were too much. Lets describe the music for a minute... Chaotic, aggressive, sludgy, heavy, noisy, and years ahead of it's time. The music is very blues based, but the grooves are aggressive and the guitars are transformed by fuzztone and overdrive into monster dinosaur riff makers. One can see that Blue Cheer is another major influence on the current doom/stoner metal scenes. Pretty amazing considering this band predated Black Sabbath by 2 years. Though not nearly as dark as Sabbath, this album is arguably heavier and noisier than \\"Black Sabbath\\" and \\"Paranoid\\". No doubt this is a hard rock/early metal masterpiece, but it's far from perfect. I rated this album on a basis of how much I enjoy it rather than it's technical merrits. The riffs are almost a-tonal, the guitars are louder and bigger than anything; bass, drums or vocals. The note-blurring distortion makes the riffs almost impossible to not sound sloppy. The guitar solos seem off key at times and the jams sound very random... but that's what makes this record so awesome. It wouldn't be half as good if these guys were proficient, classically trained musicians. This is raw, heavy rock& roll in its purest and most stripped down form. Fuzzed out fury that will rip your face off and leave you in a crumpled heap, twitching and begging for mercy. So if you're into unrestrained, distorted, feedback drenched proto-metal, look no further. If you're looking for something with pristine production, sweet melodies and clean technical proficiency, you might pass on this.
1573225517|3.0|many people read nickhornby`s &quot;high fidelity&quot; very pleasantly and made the book become a hit.but on the other other hand there are many reviewers,who are in 2 minds about this book.in what do their opinions consist?<BR>The interesting thing of the book is the form of the language. Hornby used the colloquial type with vulgar expressions with the effect that everyone can recognize and identify with the main character Rob.<BR>On the one hand it seems that Hornby just wrote the story which was going through his head on the moment without thinking a while about it. The colloquial language shows that in the topic the book is about: relationships. He tells about every kind of relationships. It is a topic which everyone is confronted with so it is interesting to read for everybody.<BR>On the other hand choosing such a simple character was not accidentally. Everyone is able to imagine such a character. The women can laugh about Rob, the man can pitty him. <BR>I think it is just a simple story without deep thoughts on the first view because after a while you can recognize that it is a role play between Robs thoughts and the story which is happening the same time. THAT BOOK IS WORTH TO BE READ!!

0393317552|4.0|With so many reviews, it hardly seems necessary to give a synopsis of this book.  I will reiterate a common compliant, it is a bit too long because some  items are rehashed.  It doesn't take into account (or give enough value to) some things, culture and religion being among them, and there seems to be some items that are missing and some contradictory.<br />That being said, I really did enjoy reading this book, it is for the most part well written and well thought out and it tackles a very big and compelling question.  I will state my beliefs here, only because they provide a lens for me, and that lens colors how I see the world.  I am a believing Christian, one that takes for granted that God created the world, not necessarily as it is, but as it once was.  I state that because, upon reflection, I think of Mark Twains' 'Letter's From Earth', and the bit there where he chastises God for creating such wonders as the tsetse fly and ring worm.<br />I think that Diamonds explanation of how some dreadful diseases jumped from animal to man,  either because of ignorance in husbandry practices, lack of cleanliness or by sexual contact explains how perhaps there can be harmony in the belief that God did create a good world, but that over time it was indeed corrupted.<br />I also bring up the subject of my beliefs to simply say that is is a very scholarly work and well received by myself, even though, it seems, my beliefs may be at odds with any researcher or writer that places belief in evolution and natural systems as the only answer to questions that we all have inside.<br />I found the discussion in this book where it relates to  animals, mammals in particular, to be very interesting.  I never before had reflected upon the fact that even though zebras seem to be much like a horse, the fact that they  cannot be domesticated and  humans were well into modern history before parts of Africa saw a horse had a huge impact upon history.<br />Having lived in Hawaii, I knew that the introduction of disease wiped out vast numbers of natives after the arrival of Europeans, but Diamond explains in detail how and why these diseases cultivated themselves in human populations and why the natives all over the New World were totally unprepared for the arrival of them.<br />There is a big deal of writing on the axis of continents and how that had a huge effect upon the development of cities and large populations.  Diamond perhaps goes over this part of his theory too much, and may put too much emphasis upon it, but the study of the effects that it had upon crops and the jump from hunter gathers to tribes to cities  still makes a good and interesting read even if a bit labored.<br />All said and done, this is a good book.  It is highly readable, which for a science/history/text book type of work is a very good thing.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in it's driving question, \\"why did some people (in the world) end up with all the cargo?\\".at the introduction of disease wiped out vast numbers of natives after the arrival of Europeans, but Diamond explains in detail how and why these diseases cultivated themselves in human populations and why the natives all over the New World were totally unprepared for the arrival of them.<br />There is a big deal of writing on the axis of continents and how that had a huge effect upon the development of cities and large populations.

B000022TSW|5.0|Apart from being one of the most hilarious films of the last ten years, \\"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\\" neatly heads-off the complaints of its critics with a plot that savagely lampoons their misguided quest to protect the ears of our children from the satanic influence of foul language. While fearlessly advocating free speech and lambasting parental censorship groups such as the MPAA, this movie also manages to be a musical which satirizes the genre with some surprisingly good songs. Trey Parker is one talented musician (see \\"Cannibal!: The Musical\\" for his early foray into the genre). If he wasn't working in film and television, he could easily be writing songs for Celine Dion or Michael Bolton - and thank God he isn't. If I were a Hollywood mogul, he and Matt Stone would have an annual no-strings-attached $50 million allowance to do with what they will.
B000002H70|5.0|Disentegration has the most wonderful arrangement of any Cure album. While the motion for the Cure after this albm could not keep up, slight Justice was done with Wish and my interest in them was lessening by Wild Mood Swings and then completely failed by Bloodflowers which was a crap album.<br />Disentegration could produce tears in even the most jaded hearted cynics and I hope that anyone with an open mind to music has this album in a safe place. Not relying on any previous effort, Disentegration is a lonely album for rain and darkness. A rare genre defying album that seems to verily incorporate some progressive inflence without even trying.<br />This is one of my personal favorites and is a meloncholy amazing album.
B000066AXC|4.0|With respectful disagreement to critics who panned this Ron Howard-directed biopic when it was first released, little wonder that &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; collected four Oscars, one for Best Picture, for its respectful and inspirational message that recovery from the hellish demons of schizophrenia is possible if the human spirit is strong enough. The subject here is Nobel prize-winning mathematician John Nash whose theories went on to figure dominantly in ecomonic policy development. The impressiveness of Nash's achievement is all the more impressive by his dealing honestly with schizophrenia that is presented in this fim with a refreshing respect. The film's acting is numbing, from Russell Crowe's Oscar-nominated depiction of Nash's battles with the demonic delusions his condition creates, to Jennifer Connelly's Oscar turn as Crowe's faithful and supportive wife. Crowe, however, is astonishing, projecting a character he has seldom, if ever, portrayed before, and we develop a deep respect for the actor's versatility. As Oscar's Best Director, Howard earned the award by managing to pull off the message, through Nash's struggle, that the human spirit can deal with, if not overcome altogether, the hell that is schizophrenia without medication. It is a respectful treatment of the mental illness, and the film, propelled by Howard's sensitivity to its subject and Crowe's moving portrayal of it, is a profound experience. In the end, we cannot help but appreciate the fragility of life and be inspired by the iron will of the human spirit. It is a magnificent achievement!
B0000004V2|5.0|Surely the greatest debut album of all time.  As others have commented, every track is a classic.  13 years on and I still listen to this album more than any other I own.  If anyone doubts its continuing importance, then they should have been with me in a club in Brixton, London last week when the DJ put on &quot;I Am The Resurrection&quot;.  I will never forget looking around the dancefloor and seeing so many kids in their late 20's and early 30's with the most incredible expressions of joy, some punching the air, some in a trance and some in tears!  For those brief few minutes we were taken back to that time when we thought we, and the Roses, ruled the world.  The Stone Roses still do.
6300181456|5.0|In this movie I see times that would scare children ages 1-5 and a few scenes that may just scare all ages.  The plot is good.  Let me explain it to you. Millie (Julie Andrews)is befriending and helping the new girl at her hotel Miss Dorothy (Mary Tyler Moore)and Ms Meers (Beatrice Lillie)is trying to kidnap Miss Dorothy!  In a plot that involves poisoning, kidnapping, and, worse than that, smoking there is alot of adventure.  Without their friend Muzzy (Carol Channing) they may be mincemeat.

B000059MPH|3.0|This big screen treatment of mystery author Agatha Christie's best-seller is dinstinguished by the first appearance of Peter Ustinov as the world famous sleuth, Hercule Periot. Though the film version of \\"Death on the Nile\\" doesn't rise to the quality of its immediate predecessor, \\"Murder on the Orient Express,\\" it is still a worthy trip with a boatful of nouveau rich upper classers who all have a motive to kill a filthy rich heiresss (Lois Childs). When she actually come up with a bullet to her head while sleeping, suspicion falls on her husband's spurned ex-fiancee (Mia Farrow, in a slightly nerve-trying overacting job) and an all-star passenger list headed by Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, Angela Lansbury and Olivia Hussey. Enter Inspector Periot and David Niven as another sleuth aiding in the investigation. Though the \\"who did it\\" isn't a surpise, the \\"how they did it\\" is, and that solution makes the film an enjoyable watch. Additionally, there's some stunning scenary of Egypt and along the Nile, and Ustinov's personification of the fabled detective is worthy. He shows up again in subsequent film versions of some of Christie's other novels, and this is one of Ustinov's better efforts.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  The comedy is not for everyone and if you are going to buy it you should be familiar with British comedy.  If you aren't familiar I would recommend renting it first.  Basically the whole movie is a pun on King Arthur and his search for the Holy Grail.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I love this group! I really dont get up the urge<br />to want to buy CDs these days cause there isnt<br />much out there, but I had to go get the new tATu<br />CD cause I loved &quot;all the things she says&quot; and<br />the music video which I found to be powerful. I<br />was very pleased with the tATu cd. The small<br />drawback is that there is only 11 tracks on this<br />CD and 3 of them are remix doubles, so you only get<br />8 different songs. Maybe Im just a tad angry cause<br />I want more tATu; dont we all? Still I found 7 of<br />8 of the songs to be great and the 3 remixes are<br />good too! Its cool to hear them sing in Russian. I<br />really hope these girls dont lose their young soft<br />voices as they get older and make new albums. Anyway,<br />if you liked &quot;all the things she said&quot; and your thinking<br />of buying the alblum, then just buy it and you will be<br />happy! They dont write their own songs, but who does<br />these days. It doesnt take away from the emotion, soul and<br />immortal greatness of these tracks!
0393316041|5.0|A nobel-prize winning physicist who plays the bongos and paints, both hobbies at a high if unprofessional level, a man with a self-admitted anti-&quot;cultural&quot; bias whose bongo playing was almost good enough to win a prestigious Parisian award, a supreme intellectual who comes from blue-collar origins and never stopped being a &quot;regular person&quot;, Richard Feynman demonstrates yet another high-level talent with this book: he's a fascinating storyteller as well. This book is an episodic autobiography; he makes no attempt to give us an in-depth story of his life. He simply tells us many of the interesting things he's seen and done in a long, varied, and interesting life. And he does so with wit and humor that most professional writers should envy.<br />I wish I'd had the chance to meet the man; after reading this book, I almost feel that I did.

B00004STPT|5.0|This soundtrack is a must-have for any Hans Zimmer fan.  The score proves that Hans keeps getting better with each piece of work he composes.  The Earth and Wheat themes are beautiful, you will notice them throughout the movie.  The last two songs, Honor Him and Now We Are Free are incredible.  Lisa Gerrard (of Dead Can Dance) voice is beautiful.  You can listen to this soundtrack over and over and it just keeps getting better.<br />If you enjoy Hans Zimmer, you should pick up The Rock, Backdraft, Pearl Harbor, Crimson Tide, or Black Hawk Down soundtracks or any of his other works.  They are all enjoyable.  Keep the great music coming Hans!  I have been enjoying your music since I first saw Days of Thunder!

0553213105|5.0|This classic detailed description of the problems faced in olden day England regarding women, enchanted my mind immediately from the books first sentence. Jane Austen's brillaince shines through on every page.Having been my first Jane Austen novel, I am most delighted to have read such fine quality of the English Language.Not only was this book captivating , but it also has relevant issues present in todays modern society! This has definitely been the best book I've ever read and the movie brings to life Jane Austen's best ever 'Pride and Prejudice'
0671721720|5.0|This sequal is entirely up to the original. Weber's fully realized future space-navy military tactics and strategies play out within the complex politics of both allies and adversaries. A geo(astro)politically logical plot line carries sympathetic characters along to the emotionally charged conclusion. The battles are described vividly, and in a manner that compels believability. This series accomplishes the science fiction author's task of providing the wealth of detail and background that allows the &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot;, without cluttering the narrative.  The type of book one reads in one sitting.

B00006JJ1O|4.0|A friend introduced me to the band yesterday evening.  I took the liberty of downloading the album to check it out (Yes, I still buy my music, but I like to hear it first)...<br />I read up on the act on MTV's website (and checked out the photos.  Nice).  What you're looking at are two russian girls, ages 17 and 18, who have parents in the music business and - as the review states - a well-known and renowned producer.  The girls are not confessed lesbians - they're marketed as such.  They seem to take the stance that they love one another, but it remains to be seen if that love is purely friendly or if it's actually something more...<br />As for the music (which is really all that matters, unless you stare at album covers while you're listening):  The disc is good.  The beats are well wrought and the lyrics are actually pretty well done for this genre.  While they catch some flack for not being native english speakers, I like the effect that their accents have on the lyrics.  It adds a sensuality, I think, and that's what this group is all about.<br />It's definitely worth a listen.  If you like to keep your techno in your clubs, then just check out some pics.  If, however, you DJ or mix your own parties ... you won't want to pass this one up.<br />Personally, I think techno is great for keeping up my energy level when I'm doing housework and other mundane tasks.  Yeah, I'm getting it.
B00005Y228|5.0|Finally Kylie has managed to at least seep through the US market, with her groundbreaking FEVER, if I'm not mistaken, this album is Kylie's biggest album throghout her 16 year career (sold over 7 million worldwide). This is her most discotronic disc to date, and even though almost each song isn't that lyrically strong, the beats just stay locked in your head. PURE DANCING FUN. Can't Get You Out Of My hEAD is an example of 'dark' bubblegum pop produced by 90's europop queen cathy dennis. Includes the swirly 'In Your Eyes' (2nd worldwide single), Love At First Sight (very daft punk) (the album version was released worldwide, except for US, ruff & jam radio mix), and the current cousin of CGYOOMH, Come Into My World. Tracks are highly infectious, fun, mystic (fragile). Notable tracks: FRAGILE, BURNING UP, YOUR LOVE. You may find yourselves victims of last song syndrome after listening to the whole album. Kylie has truly found her niche in disco pop-now. (Also recommend: STRIPPED by XTINA A.)
0553274503|5.0|I read this book when I was in High School and it is a timeless classic. I would recommend this to everybody. Excellent book.
1590710037|5.0|They say when the student is ready the teacher will appear. The instant I began reading &quot;The War of Art&quot;, I knew I was back in class. As an artist myself (actor/screenwriter) I must say Pressfield's book is worth more than any class I've ever attended. Now I know why everyone has a reason, an excuse for why things can't be done. Finally I have a name for the unseen beast that's plauged me my whole life, that's been gnawing at my soul. The battle is joined and there can be only one victor. To paraphrase Nicholson from &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, Deep down where resistance doesn't want you to talk about it, you want Pressfield's book on your wall, you need it there!

B00002SWEM|3.0|Can you imagine someone making a documentary about Beethoven and constantly interrupting his symphonies to have a talking head make numerous comments?  To interrupt such magic as heard and performed in this film is just as sacrilege.  There is a particular mood to Cuban music that lifts you up and puts you in another state.  You are lost in movement and colour.  You become a drum, a trumpet, a guitar.  You get out of your chair and dance and hug the air.  Then like some incessant commercial break you are jarred back into reality.  It's SO annoying!  Not to mention that it's hard to really listen to what they are saying when there are still traces of clouds in your brain (ever try to follow a conversation when you're drunk or high?).  Don't get me wrong, I love the interviews, and the scenery and the whole flavour of this film!  I just would have preferred it if Wenders had paid tribute to these performers by letting the music speak its language, then separately, at the beginning or the end, tacked on the interviews and other stuff.  Or at least let two or three songs play through at a time.  I know, there's always the CD one can listen to all the way, but the energy cast off by these performers as you watch them is integral to the music.  That's why people go to see live performances.<br />I'm looking forward to seeing the DVD and hearing the commentary but my dream DVD would have the music and other stuff separate.  I know I'm a perfectionist but when one is nearing an epiphany, it's a harsh thing to have it tugged out of your grasp.
B000003TBP|5.0|After the popular hit, loser that everone seemed to love, Beck came out with Odelay. I love this CD becuse it have a lot of diffrent kinds of moods in it. My Favorite is Where its at. It is just such a cool song. Buy it it rules
B00005QZWI|5.0|There is only one soundtrack that I have heard that compares to this, and it's LOTR - The Two Towers.  Howard Shore is brilliant, and deserved the Oscar.  He has a huge task to live up to these soundtracks when The Return Of The King comes out.  And Enya, just a featured artist on this album, is still the best.  The soundtrack does the movie and the book justice.
1573225517|2.0|I personally dont like this book, because it is only about everyday life of one man, Rob, who has got the same problems like thousends of other men have. Okay, I confess some parts of the book are quite funny, wehn you read how Rob is simply to foolish to handle his relationships with hie (ex)girlfriends an all these typical mistakes he makes.
6305428557|5.0|Easily one of Hugh Grant's best.  It's quaint and simple, and the music and scenery will make you want to visit the UK.  It's a simple love story, but at it's roots are the people of Wales.  This is a movie you can watch over and over again.

B000067DNC|4.0|Great Sci-Fi TV show with interesting plot &amp; great special effects.<BR>My gal likes it better than the origianl Stargate movie.
0066214122|1.0|Crichton is resting on his laurels now. He simply picks a popular topic and cranks out a canned novel on the subject. While I found the storyline interesting, the character development stinks. The main character was an imbecile. All kinds of bad things are happening around him yet he continues to deny the truth. When he does finally wake up to the problem he continues to make one wrong move after another. It's hard to believe that anyone is that dim. All of the other characters in the book are just as weak. The kids are horrendously annoying, the villains are wooden, and the good guys are uninspiring. Even the Swarm is not that scary. The ending is a little too clean as well. <br />This book is simply weak. It is not worth the money. Crichton, like Danielle Steele, can write crap now and people will still buy it. For a much better book on a similar topic read Greg Bear's Blood Music.
B0000027RL|5.0|I agree that Creed emulates Pearl Jam's style.  There are many artists that do.  Scott Stapp is in no way original or near as talented as Eddie Vedder.  There is also another point to be made.  Pearl Jam is NOT Nirvana.  Good music didn't end with Nirvana.  Pearl Jam is still around and going strong.
B00003IPFK|5.0|I strongly believe that if Lonesome Dove had been released as a theatrical movie rather than a TV miniseries it would have been considered one of the most commercially and critically successful films of all time.  Not that it would have been feasible to do- 6 hours still barely does it justice.  Maybe the success of The Lord of the Rings will convince Hollywood that people are willing to see long books adapted into lengthy, multi-part movies if done properly.  Anyway, Lonesome Dove is simply one of the best movies that I've ever seen- the fact that it aired on TV doesn't diminish that at all.  It has Titanic-sized production values, with top notch acting, writing, design and even music.  <br />Before you watch the movie, read the book.  Don't let the argument &quot;the movie is never as good as the book&quot; stop you, because in this case they are worthy equals.  This sounds silly, but when I first watched the miniseries it felt as if someone had tapped my imagination to make adapt the book exactly as I had envisioned it.  Every actor, every set, every line, every costume, every location is exactly as I imagined.  Robert Duvall IS Gus.  Tommy Lee Jones is Capt. Call (even though he does look like Kenny Rogers).  Some actors who are normally associated with TV roles give bigscreen caliber performances- Robert Urich and Rick(y) Schroeder hold their own with Duvall and Jones.  Even the minor characters are perfect- only a few are left out.  And you'll recognize several stars who appeared before they were more famous:  Steve Buscemi, Chris Cooper, Diane Lane.  <br />And be prepared to relive the devastation and heartbreak of the book all over again.  Without giving away anything, this is a brutal, tragic and sad, sad movie.  Bring that box of kleenex.  Yet it's not sentimental or manipulative- like the book, it rings true of real life.  The events aren't happy, but they work out just as they would in life.  That, I think, is where the perfection of McMurtry's story lies.  Like Terms of Endearment, things happen to these wonderful characters just as you'd expect, even if you hope that they won't.<br />This is a fine, fine movie that will hopefully hold up as a modern classic.  My only complaint is that the DVD transfer is subpar.  I don't know how well they could upgrade the sound or the picture since it was filmed for a TV screen, but hopefully someday it will be given its due with 5.1 sound, a director's commentary (6 hours of it!) and maybe even a widescreen format.
B0000027RL|4.0|I agree that Creed is a by-product of Pearl Jam.  Scott Stapp is no doubt trying to emulate Eddie Vedder.  There are a lot of artists that have the same voice or style of vocals that Vedder has.  One thing that I must mention is that there is still good music.  It didn't end with Nirvana.  I love Nirvana as much as the next person, but it didn't end there.  Pearl Jam is not Nirvana and they are still around.  Pearl Jam is still going strong and will continue to do so.
B0000067L2|4.0|I have always been a huge fan of Eric Clapton.  When I discovered the material that he created with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker I was completely blown away.  The first album I bought was Fresh Cream. Fresh Cream seemed to be a melting pot of the groups tastes in music. This album presented over amped bluesy renditions of  classic blues traditionals with  psychedelic overtones. With Disraeli Gears, Cream demonstrates a new plateau of musical genius.  This album brings forth such classics such as \\"Strange Brew,\\" \\"Sunshine of your Love,\\" and \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses.\\"  The content of this album demonstrated that Cream had begun to discover themselves and what they were capable of creating as a power trio.  This album is such a fusion of so many musical styles that it doesn't just single a particular musical audience. If you are a lover of blues, jazz, pop, and classic rock, then I highly recommend that you purchase Disraeli Gears.
B000002U9Y|5.0|It's a real shame that this album is unkown by so many Pink Floyd fans especially since its overshadowed by \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\"(which truthfully is better) There are some classic songs on here though which deserve more attention then they get.<BR>\\"Let There be More Light\\"-This song already shows Roger emerging as a talented lyric writer. The lyrics seem to be science fiction based. The song starts off with a repeating bass line, and ends with an trully amzing guitar solo by gilmour.This happens to be the 1st song the band did without Syd. 10/10<BR>\\"Remember a Day\\"- Rick Wright deems his 2 contibutions to the album as worthless, yet this is an extremely good song by him. originally to be put on Piper, it was considerd to downbeat, but added for this album. Syd plays beautful slide guitar here10/10<BR>\\"Set the Controlls for the Heart of the Sun\\"- Trully something that stands out in the Floyd catalog, like let there be more light, the same bass line can be heard for a while, while Nick adds a delicate wash of symbols,Syd and Dave share guitar roles and Rick adds his soft organ. The whole song is very softly done as Roger whispers his lyrics,(which he admited were ripped off an old chinnese poem) into the microphone 9/10<BR>\\"Corporal Clegg\\"-Roger's first lyrical attempt to inderectly deal with the guilt he felt about his fathers death in WW2. This is the last Floyd song to feature any contribution from Syd Barrett as he plays some guitar. This would be an excellent song, if it wasnt for the kazoo solos in it, which while funny, can get annoying. 7/10<BR>\\"A Saucerfull of Secrets\\"-A long musicall song, which simpily is just amazing collage of music. Anybody who likes \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" should also like this song. 9/10<BR>\\"See-Saw\\"-The band has called Rick's 2nd song on the album as 'the most boring song i've ever heard bar two', and they are right. This is a boring song, with no real highlights, and even lyrics that aint really good, i think(and hope) it wasjust put on as a filler track last minute 6/10<BR>\\"Jugband Blues\\" Syd's final song writing contibution to the band. A trully amazing way to go out, the song starts with the whole band in the begining, the salvation army brass section playing in the middle, followed by the brass section just playing randomly, ending the album with Syd alone with his accoustic singing \\"and the sea isnt green, and i love the queen, and what exactly is a dream? and what exactly is a joke?all done in exactly 3min.One of Syd's best songs. 10/10
B00006690G|5.0|Not the sickest of his albums but it definitely rates. Eminem is the best of his era, no one compares. This cd really shows his talent and genius. If you don't have it already go and get it, definitely one of the best albums he has come out with.
0553213105|5.0|Let this serve as a warning that at least one of the reviews below details most of the plot developments of this most endearing of English novels. In the unlikely event that you haven't already read Pride and Prejudice, and you like to have some surprises the first time you read a novel, you explore farther at your own peril.
6305041156|5.0|\\"Ran,\\" based on Shakespeare's \\"King Lear\\" is an excellent movie...a classic film directed by Kurosawa.  To think that someone would suggest remaking this movie for a more \\"modern\\" audience is a disgrace.  This movie is by far more superior than a lot of epic movies that were made recently (and this was made in 1985).  It was excellent when it first came out, it is excellent now, and it will be excellent for future generations.  There are things that are meant to be left alone, and \\"Ran\\" is one of those examples.
B00004RHZU|3.0|I fell asleep with my television on one night and I woke up hearing \\"There You Go\\". I wasn't looking at the TV so I assumed it was a black woman singing. I turned around and...well, you know the rest.<br />When I first listened to this album, I thought it was great. Then I listened to her second album and I couldn't get into it at first because, well, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. But then I listened to both albums again, and I realized that the second album was more accessible and entertaining.<br />There are SOME interesting songs on here, though. \\"Most Girls\\" talks about her looking for a man who will give her real love instead of just marrying into money, for example. \\"You Make Me Sick\\" is also interesting as it talks about not being able to let go of an unworthy man; a topic that wasn't as played-out back in '99 as it is now. But the rest of this album is sort of weird.<br />It's not that Pink isn't talented, but it seems like except for the aforementioned songs, this album had tracks that were basically style over substance. It seems like her songs have attitude and not much else, especially songs like the title track, \\"Hell With Ya\\", and even \\"There You Go\\". \\"There You Go\\" was great for a first single (it did go gold, after all), but a lot of the other songs on the album are like that. \\"Hiccup\\" sounds like it was thrown together at the last minute, and the mellow \\"Stop Falling\\" really doesn't belong on here.<br />This album isn't bad by any means. Still, I'm glad that Pink seems to have found her place with her second album.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|this is the album that introduced me to the subtle genius of Ryan (not Bryan) Adams.  There are so many just plain good songs on this album that it is impossible to not listen to it time after time.  i saw another reviewer use the word addictive and he hit on the head.  but there is an underlying feeling that we haven't heard the best he has to offer.  That sometime down the road that he will rock the music world with a masterpiece.  i hope so.
B00005221L|4.0|In 2002, the UK and other regions (excluding Region 1: US &amp; Canada) were treated to the 'Predator: Special Edition', a 2 disc box set which featured extra commentaries, footage, interviews etc.<br />The reason why Predator: Special Edition has not YET been released for Region-1 is that Fox Home Entertainment has released `Predator' R-1 twice already within the last 3-4 years. March 1999 was the first release, and then August 2001; the latter release having an improvement in picture and sound quality (i.e. anamorphic/DTS enhanced).<br />Currently (February 2003), Fox has again released another plain old version of `Predator' R-1 (without extra goodies i.e.), but this time in full screen.  <br />Recently, Peter Staddon - Senior Vice President of marketing at Fox Studios - hinted that the highly anticipated `Predator: Special Edition' for Region 1 will be released, PERHAPS for summer 2003.<br />Those who are satisfied with just the movie alone, this R-1 edition is good enough. Highly unlikely there'll be any improvements in terms of picture/audio on this already great anamorphic/DTS enhanced version. And it's for a lower price in comparison to what a special edition would cost.
0345451325|5.0|This book is really cool about how it talks about what happens before the game.  I liked this genre alot.  What was cool was that they didn't have the tchnology that the aliens did.  Be prepared for another book coming out in the series this one leaves you thinking. Or better yet get the game!
0553382179|5.0|Different people will take away different things from this book, depending on what point you're starting out from. If you're not quite *that* bad, or if you have anything other than a typical American lifestyle, you can selectively cull ideas from the book rather than adopting the program wholesale. In our case here in Taiwan, for example, you just *don't* wear shoes in the house, even clean tennis shoes. The main value of this book for me was how it addresses the perfectionist 'all-or-nothing' attitude that so often leads to 'crash and burn', and to feeling overwhelmed and procrastination on most other occasions. The idea of small but steady steps is an excellent one, as is that of setting a timer for 15 minutes per task, and then stopping. The to-do lists are also useful. I don't like to shop and am not really a thing collector, but cultivating a routine of throwing out 27 useless items a day promises to be a good way in my case to deal with *paper*. As some other reviewers mentioned, this book is easy and fun to read. Even - make that 'especially' - very, very busy working moms stand to gain a lot from FlyLady's experience, guidance and mind gymnastics. Centering the whole system around 'love' is another of the book's many strengths. If you ever make excuses about what you just can't get around to doing in the house, give this a try.
0783225849|5.0|The entire one hour and forty-seven minutes of the film is all here.  Psycho (1960) is still the most eerie and terrifying thriller ever made of its kind.  The DVD version is crystal-clear.  In the \\"Bonus Features\\" is a one hour and thirty-seven minute documentary that includes all the secrets of making the film plus an entertaining and delightful interview with Janet Leigh.  There is also a \\"Censored Shot\\" of Janet Leigh that never made it into the film that you can see here on DVD.  The six-minute trailer of \\"Psycho\\" with Alfred Hitchcock giving you a tour of the outside sets and inside sets is on the DVD too.<br /><br /> The A&E cable network will be broadcasting a 10-episode tv series in 2013, which is a prequel to PSYCHO (1060). It will show the relationship between young Norman Bates and his mother.
B000059Z8J|5.0|It is Superman. He is one of the most recognized American heroes of our time. The movie was a landmark in the comic to film genre. If you have not seen this film you are ineligible for the title movie-buff. No collection is complete without this and it's sequel. This film is a classic that is why it gets five stars.
0800177177|3.0|When I first saw this movie i was really impressed by how interesting it was and i really liked it.  Then I read the book.  Now usually I'm not the type of person to compare book to movie but since they did title this Bram Stoker's Dracula that implies that it should resemble the book a lot more than this did.  If you like this movie i suggest that you do read the book.  I only marked down two stars for not resembling the book which otherwise implies that to those of you who havent read the book this is a perfect movie.
630512762X|4.0|If you want action, this is a great movie for your collection. The two starring roles are acted to perfection. John Travolta and Nick Cage are exceptional in switching mind-sets of their characters. You believe totally each character as they are enlisted under both Good and Evil throughout the film. This movie bases itself on psycological warfare, but backs it up with plenty of physical action. This film is an all-around good action movie. That's why I gave it four stars and it is sitting on my shelves.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I have never been a fan of anime films and such but when I saw this movie I was blown away. I have seen it three times now and each time it gets better. The writing,animation, and music draws you in to a story line filled with love, hate, conflict and resolution. You don't need to understand anime or know what manga is to appreciate the greatness of this movie. There are no excessivly gory fights, head sized boobs, sexual scenes or other rather adult aspects often found in anime films.  But despite this, this is not one for the little kids.<BR>All and all you will absolutly LOVE Princess Mononoke and find yourself probably watching it every day.   Enjoy :)
B00007ELEL|5.0|This movie is a definite trip. This is a favorite among my friends and me. It has a great cast. Everyone did and excellent job with their roles; each character was unique. The writer for this film must have been gifted with creativeness. There are parts that I couldn't help put bust up laughing out loud each time I see them. It is not like any other film I have seen. It is refreshing each time I watch it. I watch a lot of movies and there are copious amounts of them that fall into formulas for whatever genre they may belong to, but this film is a breath of fresh air from all those movies. Don't get me wrong, I love those movies also, but I find it necessary to own a movie that allows you to take a step out of the circle from time to time. If you can appreciate the freedom and creative abilities it takes to make a film, this one is for you.
B00003CX8J|5.0|From the pages of the popular Marvel Comic, the X-Men spring to life on the big screen in a very successful way. The story deals with Mutant beings who are feared and loathed by human beings because of their powers, a team of good mutants led by Professor X ( played by Patrick Stewart) must protect mankind from a evil mutant named \\" Magento\\" ( played by Ian Mckellen), whom believes that man can never co-exists with Mutants.<br />A highly entertaining and phenomenal sci-fi comic book that has great acting, excellent cast ( Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ray Park, Bruce Davison, Rebecca Stamos, and Anna Paquin), a good storyline and tons of intense spectacular special effects. A comic book movie that kids and adults can enjoy together, it's truly one of the best comic book movies ever.<br />The DVD is X-cellent, it has a great transfer with excellent sound, tons of extras like Still Gallery, Trailers, TV Spots, Easter Eggs and more. So own this DVD if your a fan of Comic Books, Sci-fi, action or just a lover a movies and share it with your family on a film they will never forget.<br />Also recommended: Spider-Man, The Crow, Batman, Superman, Scanners, Akira, Carrie, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, The Fifth Element, The Matrix, Attack of the Clones, Resident Evil, Dark City, Ghost in the Shell, Total Recall, Supergirl, The Hulk, X-Men 2, Daredevil and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
B00005JL78|5.0|This movie will blow you away! It was such a visually entertaining film I would go so far as to say it has the best futuristic visuals I have seen in film. Equally important is how great the plot was. This is a very suspenseful film. It is longer than most films, but well worth the time invested into it's viewing. The film could have ended in two different spots int he plot and I would have been perfectly happy with it. Instead it continues to twist. I recommend this film to all who enjoy special effects and meandering scenarios.
B00006GFAB|5.0|The greatest rock and roll band of all time has put out another greatest hits album.  From Strutter, to Rock n'Roll all nite(live) to Hard Luck Woman to God Gave Rock and Roll to you II, it showed what KISS was capable of.  My only objection is that all the tracks weren't live, because KISS is soooo much better live then they are in the studio.  <br />In short, if you are a fan of KISS, you NEED this CD.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a definite 'must-see' action film. If you have not seen this film yet it is time to come out from under that rock. 2003 is the year for the Matrix. The follow-ups are to be released this year. The Super Bowl was yesterday and the trailer aired for Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions. It was the one commercial that changed the room of guys from roaring laughter from the Budweiser commercial into silence and put us all under a spell of awe-inspired concentration. We all make a vow to be there opening night. No one should miss out on these films of 2003. But before you consider the easy decision of going to the theater, you must take the action needed to see this film in order to prepare you for the rush of Reloaded and Revolutions. No decision here, if you want to see the sequels, you must see the origin.
B0000640VO|5.0|I had no idea what was going to happen next in this movie but I loved it.  It's just an adorable, frothy film about an oddball girl in search of something but not really knowing what.  The torture of the vegetable man was pure genious.  Definitely worth seeing!
B00004Y7SF|2.0|I was disappointed with this Christmas album. Christina Aguilera has such a beautiful and powerful voice, but she messed up so many songs by doing and endless amount of runs/malissmas. Usually it's very good for vocalists to show off their talents, but Christina Aguilera took it to a point with this album where it just became annoying. You could not sing along with any of the traditional Christmas tunes because Christina was all over the board while singing them. I just wish that she would have just used her great voice to just sing instead of trying to blow everyone way with how many malissmas she can create. We all know she's a good singer, but in this case, she didn't sound good at all.
B00005JL96|4.0|The single thing that most impressed me with this movie is the fact that all the characters have REAL bodies.  Lilo is this cute little pudgy girl and her sister is normal looking (not mutant as most animated characters are).  The movie can get a bit gross at times (perfect for very little kids who enjoy such things) so be forewarned.  I liked that this movie is so different than everything else for kids.  It's a cute movie that can stand up to the constant replays that are sure to happen.
B00005NRO3|4.0|Although Scream 2 is a good sequel in many respects, I felt that this film lacked much of the freshness of the first. The cast was good and the twists and turns surprised you, but it just wasn't the same. I would still recommend this film, especially after watching the first, but I wouldn't make it mandatory.
B000059QY2|5.0|Okay, first off, it's a FILM version of the opera, so one can't quite judge it by the standards of a recorded live opera.  After being a devoted opera fan for over 20 years, I need to mention that ANYONE, not only \\"newbies\\" will enjoy it.  What I immediately noticed was the fact that the opera score is here without omissions, a problem that haunts many attempts of making a good opera film.  \\"Otello\\" or \\"La Traviata\\", for instance, are superbly staged, but they suffer from many scene omissions, which can be upsetting to the fans.  Not the case here, at least I could not find any without having to retrieve my copy of the score and compare it line by line.<br />The absolute revelation for me was Mr. Ingwar Wixell.  I've heard his voice many times, particularly on early Verdi recordings brought to life by Lamberto Gardelli.  Well, here he sounds even better, plus he proves himself as one of the best singing actors I've ever seen.  At the first scene at Duke's palace, Rigoletto is plain disgusting, no wonder Monterone curses him.  By the way, Monterone is played by Wixell as well, and I was surprised by the sonority and great low register that his baritone is able to produce.  Later, he's a obsessively loving father and a mischievous \\"vendicator\\".  Loved Feruccio Furlanetto's Sparafucile!  I could not believe it was him under all that makeup, but the pitch-black quality of his voice is unmistakable.  Edita Gruberova has long been one of the world's leading high coloratura sopranos.  Indeed, to be able to accurately negotiate Gilda's tessitura, one needs a spectacular high range.  Sutherland also had that kind of high register, but Gruberova was a better choice cinematically, I suppose.  Still, I wished for a subtler portrait of Gilda, but it had to do.  Pavarotti's Duke is why, of course, most folks will buy this DVD.  Well, he definitely gives a dashing Duke.  He sings up a storm on a soundtrack (including the impossible high-flying ending of \\"possente amor\\") and a tongue-in-cheek \\"la donna e mobile\\", his signature aria.  He overplays a bit, but he's a lot of fun to watch.  Since he does not have to sing and move at the same time, he really bounces around quite a bit and looks very much at home throughout.<br />The film depicted the court of the Duke in the most accurate way.  They're quite like vultures, and appropriately dressed in black.  Marullo is sang by none other than Bernd Weikl, but played (wonderfully) by an actor.  Even Giovanna is cast luxuriously - it's Fedora Barbieri who does not only provide a great voice, but also some much-needed comic relief in this fairly dark opera based on Hugo's \\"The King Amuses Himself\\".  Riccardo Chailly conducts with gusto, but also with proper sensitivity.<br />Overall, it's a well thought-out film, I could not think of a way of making it any better.  Even the often messed-up abduction scene is quite believable here.  The subtitles are not bad, and the picture on DVD is a LOT better than on VHS or LaserDisc.n-cheek \\"la donna e mobile\\", his signature aria.  He overplays a bit, but he's a lot of fun to watch.

630521610X|5.0|Scream has to be one of the greatest horror films of all time! It has everything: romance, suspense, humor, and shock value. It was so nice to see this film after the string of terrible sequels (Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street) that were made in the 90's.<br />What made it even better was that this film paid homage to many, if not all, of the films I mentioned above. There was just the right amount of humor mixed in with the jumps and gore.<br />I would highly recommend this film, especially if you want something different than the typical slasher flicks.
6305910340|5.0|This is a great movie, both for adults and kids. I bought this primarily for myself, since I love chess, but also for my wife. We have seen it many times and enjoy it time. If you thought chess was only for braniacs, this movie will show you otherwise. It is very much a sport. In fact, many very good athletes who also play chess will tell you that a chess tournament is physically more draining than many sport competitions. I would certainly agree.<br />The tournament play is realistic as is the jaunts to chess clubs in Manhattan and Washington Square, which I visit as often as I can when we go to New York City. The stress, fun, elation, effort, exhaustion, sound and everything about the tournaments are great. The \\"moral of the story\\" is the greatest part, though (no, I won't mention it here).<br />The sound is fantastic. The cinematography is accurate and great. The editing is very good. The transfer to DVD is very good.<br />Definitely a movie to have available for guests.
6305903182|3.0|When Scream 3 was released, I was very excited. However, all that I received was disappointment. To me, this is the worst film out of the trilogy, which started off really good. After watching Scream and Scream 2, you pretty much know what could occur. I will admit that there were some twists that were unexpected, but after the initial shock was over, you were left thinking, &quot;why did they do that?&quot;<br />The ending, no matter how suspenseful, made me want to scream at Wes Craven. I felt that he could have come up with something much better than Sidney's long lost brother being the killer. Scott Foley didn't seem like the best casting choice, but he served his purpose.<br />I guess it was a little disheartening to find that many of the characters that the audience has grown to love in the previous movies were killed off all because of a stupid plot twist.<br />Don't get me wrong, the entire Scream trilogy is good, but if you can, I would definitely skip this third installment.
B00007FOMP|5.0|This is by far the greatest album ever made. The reason I say this is because not only is it a great collection of songs but it has such a consistent sound and message. The quality of the song writing and musicianship is unsurpassed by any pop,rock,or soul ablum ever. The only thing you maybe able to compare it to is a great Jazz masterpiece like Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, but better because of the accessablity of a traditional gospel/soul song structure. This is the only album I own on vinyl, cassette, and CD. I recommed that you pick up the album on vinyl since the warm tones and crackle that come from old lps makes the listen experince that much better. Also pick up the double CD edition which feature the original \\"Detroit Mix\\" of the album as well as a rare live performace of the entire album.
0060523794|3.0|Gerstner accurately describes what IBM was like back then. Employees believed they had a right to play around and still get paid. They were owed a lifetime job. Managers were frightened to death of actually disciplining anyone. Personnel dept would make your life miserable. Plus you would become known as someone who can't manage effectively. Fire someone?, forget it. First thing I learned when I made manager was never fire anybody. Just wait till you can unload them on someone else. <br />IBM socialism meant that the sales offices constantly played around with quotas. So you never got really hurt, and you never really made big money. So why put out the effort? You weren't going to get fired. <br />The [...] labs could care less what the market needed. They would play around with stuff until they had perfected it that last 1%. The fact that it would come out 6 months late and 20% overpriced never bothered them. Sales reps didn't sell what made a profit, they sold what had the most sales points attached.<br />I don't think this is a great book but it is interesting and easy to read. And it is absolutely true that IBM needed someone to shake it violently by the collar to make it pay attention to the crisis. All the other reviwers whining about the changes remind me of all the people I knew at IBM who were in denial....\\"if we just wait a little longer... everything will be all right\\". Like it or not someone had to radically change the Company we all loved.<br />Even though I lucked out and took the first buyout, I wish I still worked there. There is something about being an IBMer.
B00006LFGD|5.0|To call this a \\"new\\" Barbra CD is misleading. It is new in the sense that two of the songs has never been released before --- the bubble-gummy \\"I Won't Be the One to Let Go\\" with Barry Manilow and the poignant \\"All I Know of Love\\" with Josh Groban --- but it's best to think of this as time spent with Babs and buddies. (Why Josh is considered a \\"special guest\\" on the CD's TV commercials is quixotic.) It's neat to have all these tunes on one \\"limited edition\\" CD, especially the seldom-heard pairing of Babs and Harold Arlen on \\"Ding-Dong! The Witch is Dead!\\" Yet it would have been nice if Babs had penned some recollections about duet, instead of dismissing the talent she shared with a one sentence thank you. All in all, \\"Duets\\" is a CD that's pure BS ... a CD guilty of egotism. And talent.

B000002KB8|5.0|Yes, you read the subject to this review right. This is the best Black Sabbath album. I didn't used to think this, but when I listened to it again a couple of months ago, I realized how awesome this album really is. The guitar is great, the bass is solid, the drums are furiously played, and Ozzy's vocals are haunting. The album starts with none other than \\"Black Sabbath\\". Is there any better way to start off an album than this song? The rain fades in, then the thunder and the distant sound of a bell, and then BOOM! HEAVY METAL IS BORN. The riff itself is very simple, yet so very evil. Our first chance to hear Ozzy is a spooky one to be sure. He sounds like Satan himself in this song. The climax is also one of music's great moments, with that awesome riff and the superb guitar solo by Tony Iommi. The next song is another classic. \\"The Wizard\\". Sure, the lyrics are nothing special, but that's not why I listen to Sabbath. The harmonica playing by Ozzy is great in this bluesy-metal song. Bill Ward's drumming is wonderful. You'll be banging your head hard to this one. The next track has four songs on it, which I think was a cool idea. \\"WASP\\" is the short rocking intro to \\"Behind The Wall Of Sleep\\". Once the intro is over, a really cool riff is played and Ozzy's vocals come in. This song is yet another classic. The middle section is great, with Ozzy saying \\"Like a body to a corpse\\" over and over. Bill Ward's drum beat fades out as Geezer Butler's bass solo \\"Bassically\\" fades in. Neat effect. The bass solo is very enjoyable, and when it ends, an incredibly distorted bass riff starts \\"N.I.B.\\" which is one of heavy metal's greatest songs, along with one of heavy metal's greatest riffs. There's not a single part of this song that I don't enjoy. I love the guitar solos from Iommi, especially the one at the end. I also love the chorus when it gets quiet and Ozzy goes \\"I'm going to feeeeeeeeel\\" and then that heavy riff comes in again. AWESOME. The next song is \\"Wicked World\\", which is probably the weakest song on the album, although it's still awesome as hell. The riff is great, and the lyrics are neat. Iommi's guitar solo is great. The last track has three songs, although I don't know where \\"A Bit Of Finger\\" takes place. The beginning short song is \\"Sleeping Village\\" with it's dark acoustic riff. This is a really cool song, and I wish it was longer. Then as soon as that ends, \\"Warning\\" begins with a strong guitar riff. From there, there's a bunch of cool riffs for a while until the song slows down into the verse portion of the song. This is a cover tune so I can't credit any of the band for the awesome lyrics, but Ozzy does a great job of singing in this one. The last quarter of the song ( this song is 14 minutes, by the way ) is a bunch of guitar playing, including a 2 minute guitar solo by Iommi where he's the only one playing. Then the song goes back to one final verse and then it ends. There it is... An all-time classic album. Buy it, NOW!
B00004Y6Q5|4.0|What a film, straight after watching it I had to get the soundtrack. It came in a slipcase and the track names where covered. When i got it home and opened it up, i was shocked at seeing 30+ tracks. They ranged from 20 seconds to 4 minutes but the average is probably 1 min 10sec's per track which is deeply disapointing.<br /> What the lazy buggers have done is to just copy and paste tracks, exactly how they where in the film, same length and all. This means that just as you're getting into a track, it ends which is massivly frustrating. Luckily tracks 27-32 follow on from each other giving you an epic 17minute track to enjoy. <br /> All in all, after searching there are about 5 decent length tracks to enjoy, and because the quality of music is so good i have no choice but to give it 4 stars. Its a shame that they couldn't create a few proper tracks. <br /> Those who haven't watched the film can expect deeply moving string based classical music but with the addition of fused bigbeat/ driving chamber music to give it that dark atmosphere and extra edge. Its basically a string version of Clint Mansells excellent Pi score. That definatly needs to be checked out as does the film. You however might not fully understand the emotiveness of the tracks if you haven't watched the film. When i listen to the score, i instinctivly remeber the certain emotional parts of the film and it leaves me disjointed. <br /> Those looking to follow up the Kronos Quartet in order to find similar stuff shouldn't waste their time. I have heard some of Kronos's interpretations of classical music and although great, its a world apart from this score because it is straight classical devoid of any soundscape or techno trappings. I however do recommend you should at least try out the remixed version of this soundtrack if you are fond of more dance based versions of this score.
B00000J2PH|5.0|TAPESTRY is a classic.  There's not a single song on here that doesn't make me crow, &quot;Oooo, I like this one.&quot;  <br />The album as a whole is an honest, humble tapestry of songs sung in a down-to-earth voice.  Love stories are a key theme, and it's a theme approached from so many angles, it really creates a complex portrait.  <br />SO FAR AWAY is a must-listen when you're lonely for your long-distance love.  It also expresses a healthy skepticism about a culture of coupling in which people don't tend to stay together for very long.<br />I FEEL THE EARTH MOVE is a perfect, upbeat expression of the excitement of falling in love with someone new.  Everyone loves that song.<br />BEAUTIFUL is an inspiring plea to all the listeners to try to be happy and be kind every single day of our lives.  Very inspiring!<br />And I've always had the strangest feeling when I hear Carole King sing YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A NATURAL WOMAN.  When I hear others sing it, I think they're singing to a man or a lover.  But when Carole sings it ... listen to it from this point of view and see whether you agree ... when Carole sings it, I think she might be talking about God.  Just my opinion!  Listen to the whole song and get into the feel of it.  Not sure - but I think I might be right.<br />Everyone but everyone should own this album!  It's a tribute to optimism and an honest expression of the heart when it's at its warmest.
0553801511|5.0|I read the Farseer trilogy, which is a must in my opinion to truly understand the characters in this book first.  I then read the Liveship Traders trilogy.  Both those series makes this a wonderful read.  This is a perfect piece of fantasy reading.  Hobb develops the characters keeping them dynamic.<br />It's worth every penny I spent on it.
B000000ORX|5.0|I came to Joni Mitchell by way of her earliest folk music, so the &quot;new Joni&quot; featured on this album was a surprise to me!  Her voice has gotten SO SMOKEY - I hardly recognized her.  And the overall sound of the album is so richly polished, smooth as a jazz club, and moist as dew on moss.  <br />This album is fabulous!  (Once you get used to the change).  It starts off with the sound of crickets, leads you through one multi-layered, full musical experience after another, and her new lower, rougher, but still expressive voice rocks you in a cradle of carefully written lyrics.  <br />This album, more than any of Joni's others, is an EXPERIENCE OF MOOD.  The low singing, the luscious production, the soothing beats all lend themselves to a feeling of moody comfort.  The perfect album for, as the title suggests, a night ride home.  Also the perfect album to accompany an after-work glass of wine by candlelight.
B00000K31V|4.0|There is a point in the movie &quot;eXistenZ&quot; where the viewer is not sure whether the characters are in a game or in real life. Actually, this is pretty much the whole movie. David Cronenberg's Matrix-esque film was one of the many cyberpunk films of 1999, among &quot;The Matrix,&quot; &quot;The Thirteenth Floor,&quot; and &quot;Menno's Mind.&quot; This isn't the best, but it is a bold attempt and it is captivating throughout. It just lacks a sense of originality. Cronenberg's directing is dank and dirty, appropriate since a large amount of the film has our characters dissecting gooey creatures. This isn't a movie to eat a pizza while watching it. Our characters serve as mere tour guides into the mysterious future that lays before us, where humankind has become addicted to VR video games. This new world surrounds the movie and grabs hold of the audience, answering every question it can in the 90-minute runtime. One thing this film has little of is plot-holes, for which I am very thankful for. Overall, I'd say if you were in to Cronenberg or like cyberpunk flicks, or just think Jude Law is hot, you'll enjoy this movie.
B000002C1V|1.0|The nadir of Pink Floyd's recorded output, The Final Cut began life as a dumping ground for leftover songs from The Wall and soundtrack versions from the film of the same name.  In the end, the soundtrack songs never made it onto the album.  Of the leftovers -those that were considered not good enough for The Wall- Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour said that if they weren't good enough to release before &quot;what makes them any good now.&quot;<BR> Gilmour is right on the mark: the songs on The Final Cut rank among the worst in the bands history.  There is a complete lack of melody on the entire album; the songs are slow, plodding and limp.  One is hard pressed to even consider this a rock album.  It is the ultimate spit in the eye of Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd, which was full of fun, excitment and musical inventiveness.  The Waters lead Floyd heard here sounds more like a man occasionally waking himself up from a deep sleep by snoring too loudly.<BR> Since Waters completely dominated the band on The Final Cut all musical considerations are secondary to his half-sung lyrics.  And Waters is, without a doubt, one of the worst singers in Rock, meaning that this is a worst case senario.  In fact, a case can be made for never listening to the album again.
0312952813|5.0|This is the third Connelly that I have read, and the first featuring Harry Bosch. I was really impressed, and this makes me want to pick up all the Bosch novels. It is moody and dark, with  and well-drawn  and well-developed characters. While Connelly's non-Bosch works were quite good, this genuinely approaches great.<br /><br />The story features drugs and corruption between Mexico and the LAPD. Bosch is a character who is a tough maverick in a believable kind of way. He is hard-boiled but still has some soft points-- standard requirements for the classic noir detective. The way that he makes the character interact with the plot is less standard. Too often, writers who are working in the noir side of the genre create nothing but faithful imitations of Chandler or Hammett. Connelly is brave enough to update the form, and it succeeds fantastically.<br /><br />If the rest of the Bosch books are as good as this one, then I do not think it will take me very long to work my way through the collection. Recommended.
0316666343|5.0|Yet again, another solid book from a graduate of the University of California Irvine Creative Writing program.  In this case, The Lovely Bones is one of the best new novels that I've come across in a long time.<br />When I first heard about the book I'll admit I was a bit skeptical.  The idea of a story told by the spirit of a murdered young girl (Susie Salmon) sounded gimmicky. Yet, this book transforms what could end up like a cheap gimmick into a moving story that is gripping, surprising and full of important messages and observations about loss, the importance of family and growing up.<br />In this case, the book details the crushing impact of violent crime on a family.  It's similar in some cases to Joyce Carol Oates' We Were the Mullvaneys and Donna Tartt's new book, The Little Friend.  Of those three books, this is the most personal. The characters of Susie's family, friends and the perpetrator come to life in a way that makes it hard to put the book down.<br />The only small complaint that I might have is that the book might have become a little too mushy and sentimental at times but my reaction at the end was that I was glad that I read this and heartily recommend it.

0066620996|2.0|Despite my doubts about the validity of some of Mr. Collins data, the book is worth reading - if only to learn the buzz words and phrases it creates for business folks today. That said, as a former researcher and current business person, I am very dubious of his studies results. Time after time in the book, Mr. Collins brings the reader into the team's preliminary discussion of their findings - frequently offering study snippets like \\"we didn't want to conclude this but every single one of our Great companies did x,y or z\\" whatever the point of his chapter happened to be. The problem is that I just don't buy that all of his major points were universally true across every single company they compared - both the great and the not so great. Objective data analysis just does not turn out this conveniently true if the researcher is unbiased. In fact, many important truths are found because of the data contradicting preconceived ideas.<br />I am not implying that Mr. Collins and his team are not honest. Rather, I think they may be guilty of assuming there must be universal, simple truths rather than general principles, when life or business simply don't turn out that way in the real world. At times, the writer's tone seems ike an evangelical preacher trying to get everyone to agree with him or they will perish in the fire's of hell. Why does he spend so much time trying to convince us of the universal, absolute truth of each of his findings? Why are there no \\"truths\\" that were not always present in the Great companies? Wouldn't we have still believed him if Level 5 leaders, for example, were only present in 72% of the Great companies? For me, the book would have been more powerful and I would have taken it more seriously if the findings weren't proclaimed to be quite so universal. But, such real truth was not going to happen for this team because that would not fit their preconceived models and apparent need to find black and white truths only.
6302581907|4.0|My husband and I rented &quot;Sister Act&quot; after viewing it on TV one afternoon. We were especially impressed with the way Goldberg's character transformed a dissonant choir in a very traditional church setting into an energized and creative choir which succeeded in drawing people in from the streets and eventually transforming the haughty Mother Superior (Maggie Smith)into a &quot;believer&quot; in the power of her church's upbeat musical repertoir. We even used a short clip from the film to show to committee members from our own traditional church, in the attempt to illustrate the necessity of contemporizing our church <BR>service and music. It made for a very spirited meeting of our committee. Everyone seemed to enjoy it.

B000001E29|5.0|Black Rider is one of the most original, thought provoking, interesting, and just plain one of the best cds out there. This is what Tom Waits does, creates music for the intelligent listener. He teamed with William Burroughs on this album, which I think is what helps give it its distinct flair. I don't review much music, so for me to have come to review this cd shows how much I respect Tom Waits, and especially this album.

The powerful heartache and angst that is central here is portrayed brilliantly and passionately by Greg Dulli.  The deft and tight musicianship complements his voice perfectly, ranging from hard pounding angular chords to swirling psychedelic guitars.

B00005JL7Q|4.0|I skipped seeing this film when it was in theaters.  Though I had a bit of interest in seeing it becasue it was based on the novel by Nick Hornby, I was afraid that the dircetors of American Pie were going to screw it all up.  Well, when it finally arrived on DVD i rented it, and was very glad I did, because About A Boy is a wonderful film.  <BR>  It is funny, moving, and Hugh Grant fits his part perfectly.  <BR>  On the whole, I wouldn't say it is on par with High Fidelity with John Cusak, the other film based on Hornby's work, but it is very entertaining nonetheless.<BR>  Be sure to check out the soundtrack as well, performed by Badly Drawn Boy.  Also check out his new album &quot;Have You Fed the Fish?&quot;.
B00005U18E|4.0|Renee Zellweger IS Bridget Jones, in my opinion, perhaps because I saw the movie before I read the book. Who else can convey Bridget's myriad and truly unique emotions with a simple roll of the eyes and a lift of the eyebrow? She makes us love her as she struggles with her &quot;singleton&quot; life as a 30s-something Brit who just can't quite get anything right.<br />Having watched the movie again AFTER reading the book, I was even more enchanted with her wonderful performance. And of course the addition of Colin Firth as an updated Mister Darcy, parodying his own performance as the haughty and brooding Darcy in the BBC version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; is simply too delicious to miss. As Bridget devotees know, Bridget and her girlfriends have quite an obsession with Mr. Firth...and he plays along with the joke without once letting us down.<br />It is Hugh Grant, however, who gave me pause. Hugh plays Hugh, as he always does, but this time he's the villain, if you will--Bridget's faithless and rotten boss Daniel, who loves her and leaves her a number of times. I just couldn't quite see Hugh as the bad guy, and he did not, to my mind, resemble the nasty user in the book. On the other hand, I always find him a delight, so this weakness did not ruin the movie for me.<br />For those who like their movies to be absolute replicas of the book, this is not the one to watch. Rather, it is a delightful, fast-paced and maybe a little bit frenzied hodgepodge of bits and pieces of the book, with a little more thrown in. Some memorable parts of the book, such as Bridget's battle with the &quot;nasty underpants,&quot; are taken out of context, but still very funny. The book's gentle parody of Pride and Prejudice is still in evidence, and very funny, thanks to the above-mentioned deadpan performance by Firth. Bridget is no Elizabeth Bennett, but the whole thing works, somehow, just as it did in the book.<br />This is the kind of movie to pop into the VCR whilst drinking a bottle of wine with one's girlfriends in front of the telly. It doesn't get old, and it is simply pure pleasure.a bottle of wine with one's girlfriends in front of the telly. It doesn't get old, and it is simply pure pleasure.
B000063WDH|3.0|They're certain to hate it, but Akron's The Black Keys are going to be compared to The White Stripes.  Which is shorthand for:  they're a combo that adores the blues.  On The Big Come Up, guitarist/vocalist David Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney sound like they stepped out of the Mississippi delta listening to John Lee Hooker (vibe), Creedence Clearwater Revival (structure), Jimi Hendrix (vocals i.d.), and, um, DJ Shadow (rhythms).  In a rock season where everything old is new again, it remains to be seen whether this twosome produces work that will hold up in the blues canon.  Yet they never seem inauthentic in their retro leanings - sincerity counts for a lot with the basics.  In five years time, The Big Come Up might sound just as good as any other great blues joint that seems old as the hills and immediate as tomorrow's news.

B000002JS6|4.0|The first album after singer Bon Scott's death was the one that brought AC/DC into the mainstream of rock and made them a household name. Tracks like Shoot to Thrill, Have a Drink On Me, Shake a Leg, Back in Black, and Hells Bells are all classics and are still playing strong on the radio to this day! However, I'm a huge Bon Scott fan, and I think Highway to Hell (1979, Bon's last album) was a lot better than Back in Black. I even think that in some ways, the follow up to this album, For Those About to Rock (1981) is better, because it has more energy overall and is less slick big-hair 80's rock than Back in Black. But every time I play Back in Black, I remember listening to the cassette when I was 11 yrs old, begging my mom to take me and my brother to the concert.

We have a copy for his diaper bag too, for those unexpected naps at grandma's..<BR>I also love all her C.D's...but this one is my favorite. A great C.D for quiet evenings at home, or for a long soak in the tub! Many songs on it are remakes, but done in her very own unique way. You won't be disappointed! Enjoy!
B000002JS8|5.0|Everyone thinks that Back in Black was their best album, but I beg to differ! AC/DC started out with somewhat repetitive guitar and comedic lyrics, which was cool in its own right. Then came a slight transition of Let There Be Rock and Powerage (both are excellent), which had a slightly harder edge to them. The last album that Scott sang on was Highway to Hell, an almost macabre prediction of where he was headed just months after the album released. This album is an excellent collection of love songs (lol), that really tell the story of how a rock band deals with groupies and bimbos, but written brilliantly to express the positive and negative emotions involved in one-night stands. Add to that the best guitar playing of the band so far in their career, and you have a rock album that stands alone in history. Every song is good, the tempo is right for the group, and Scott puts his heart and soul into every lyric. Its a must have for anyone who likes rock, whether or not they like AC/DC.
B00000J7S8|5.0|This C.D has a few more upbeat songs in it, compared to some of her other more mellow albums. This is a wonderful Jazz album, done in a way that only Diana Krall can. Very enjoyable!! I have a copy in my car, for my drive into work! You won't be disappointed!
B000006TRV|5.0|At first glance, this CD looks rather inconspicous. A plain, white cover, just normal bricks in a wall, with the plain title \\"Pink Floyd - The Wall\\" ANYONE who has listened to this CD can tell you that it isn't normal at all. It's revoloutionary. I would highly reccomend that you buy it WITH Dark Side of the Moon. Not only does it come cheaper, but you can own a piece of music history. Personally, I prefer Disc 2 (It's two discs...). Disc 2 is more mellow, but it also keeps with more of the central themes of Disc 1. It also contains the Super-Mega-Ultra hit Comfortably Numb, with a mind-numbing guitar solo. On Disc 1 is the more rock-ish \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" and \\"In the Flesh?\\". Both are excellent tracks also. Anyway, whether you are a die-hard Floyd Fan (and most of them already have this CD,) or if you're just looking to own a classic album, the Wall is definetly the way to go.
B000065EXI|4.0|This is a great album, filled with smoot relaxing Jazz...you won't be disappointed...enjoy!

B00006CXSS|5.0|Filled with action and drama, this DVD set is one of the best I have ever seen.<BR>Telling the story of the Easy Company trough World War II. You get the chance to follow them from the Training camp in Toccoa to the end of the World War II.<BR>The story is so weel told that you can enjoy all kind of genres along the series, drama, action, suspense, etc.<BR>Also the acting is very very good, the new comer Damian Lewis delivers in a superb way his portrayal of Richard Winters.<BR>About the technochal aspects of the DVD set I can tell you that the quality of the box set is Superb. The Audio is engaging all the time, including a DTS track that puts you in the middle of the action, with an intense sound on all the channels. The video also is one of the best I have seen in TV sets.<BR>It is a sure buy, you will never regret paying the high price.
0743424425|5.0|The Shining was my first Stephen King book and I was VERY impressed. It was absolutely terrifying and I could hardly read it at night because it was so realistic! I absolutely love his writing style... I know that from now on I will be hooked. This book had everything I love, ghosts, psychic abilities, suspense and an incredible plot. I had seen the movie a while back and I was scared but the movie is NOTHING like the book. There were so many more details and interesting aspects in the book.  I would definitely recommend The Shining.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Take this move for what it is which is an exciting action flick. The criticism I hear for this film is that it is fast paced resembling a  2 hour commerical. My answer to that is YEAH YOUR RIGHT SO F'N WHAT!!! first off the comet that was to crash into earch was discovered 2 weeks before impact therefore,  thats a reason in itself as to why the pace of this film is frantic. I 'm sure every person would be frantic with the thought that the world would end in two weeks. May be the bone headed movie critics believe that people would be relaxed enough to take a tea break. Unlike  DEEP Impact which resembles a  2 hours   self pitty borefest, Armegedon got it right by expressing the true nature of humanity which is self preservation by all means necessary by never excepting defeat. I enjoyed the plot sequences ,the suspense, and action pact drama, and even the comedic twists that comes along the way. Jerry Bruckheimer did a great job of countinously keeping a viewers attention with the events that lead up to the destruction of the asteroid. He was breif and to the point with the scenes. As I said, this movie is what it is which is a high impact action flick and it does a great job for being that.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals, like The Wall has all the under pinnings of the dark 70's english punk anger yet by all accounts it is still Pink Floyd at their near finest. I believe DS of the Moon still ranks the best. But don't be afraid of this album. This is one work one fantastic song (in 5 parts), one great journey into the seventies \\"Authority [Stinks]\\" mentality. Lots of sweet keyboards and always some new sounds from Gilmore's guitar. He's the guy that makes Waters' songs sound good. Wonderful ear candy and it never drifts away from the BIG SOUND of Pink Floyd. I bought it while I was in high school and 26 years later it delivers more every time I hear it. Buy (don't [download]) this masterpiece.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Like i said in the title, there truly are no words to fully describe the talent of John Mayer. He has unique sound, incredible songwriting and distinctive, beautiful voice. <BR>There is no question why Elton John is one of his biggest fans and said that John is a \\"lyrical\\" genius. He's absolutely amazing. If you appreciate great music, you'll love John Mayer. His songs are perfect whether you're a teen, or grown up, it doesnt matter. His music speaks for everyone. Some reviewers may say \\" the little 12 year olds just like him because hes cute!\\" Yes, I think he is totally gorgeous, but it takes a hell of a lot more than looks for me to become addicted to an artist.<BR>Listen to all of John Mayer's songs, you wont be disappointed. To sum it up in 2 words, he is absolutely amazing!!!
B000002I27|4.0|...Awesome DOORS! A bit of artistic decline following the debut (I've said it with my review of that album and I shall say it again....The Doors' debut is the greatest Rock n Roll album ever made), the guys hit paydirt again with great melodies in My Eyes Have Seen You, You're Lost Little Girl, and the thunderous When the Music's Over. After Strange Days, Mojo would slip quickly into alcoholism (he wasn't really a junkie...HE WAS A DRUNK), and the tensions would rip the band apart, especially between Jim and John. Then came Miami and it was over. Krieger is, as usual, a master with the SG and Paul. A MUST-HAVE for any lover of fine , KILLER rock and roll.
B00002ND77|5.0|That is what Denzel shows you in the amazing life of this man. <br />After such a long time of fighting to get this story to the big screen I wondered if Denzel would be able to pull it off. I thought Laurence Fishburne would have been a better choice at the time. Denzel made me a beleiver. The life of this man was truly something else.  What he had to go through in heavily racist America during his time as a child, teen and adult was enough to make most just give up an not think of changing. But then to continue on and turn his life around to be something so positive, dynamic, to stand up face the evil and fight, only to have so many forces (inside and out) against him in the end shows the tremendous strength he had.  Denzel conveys just about every aspect of this in this role.  It had to be hard for him to walk in this mans shoes and try not to be consumed by his emotions.  Imagine, the assaination scene. Even as an actor portraying a role his mind had to be at the bursting point completing a scene where the life of such a man was just snuffed out like a candle.  It had to be hard to let go afterward.<br />The story and his performance make this movie worth getting.  This is American History 101.
B00003CXA6|4.0|The movie \\"Gettysburg\\", at over 4 hours in length, is one hell of a long movie, but definitely worth it! If you like American history, and especially American Civil War history, you should love this movie!<br />This movie quite correctly chronicles in a dramatic way, the Battle of Gettysburg. All in all, it covers the major events of the battle, but certainly does not cover everything, but that's ok. It is simply the best movie/docudrama ever made about the Battle of Gettysburg that has hit the big screen. I didn't say it was the best overall and accurate portrayal of the Battle of Gettysburg. It is a great general view of it.<br />A lot of criticism has been aimed at this movie by Civil War buffs, mainly because of factual errors of who was on what part of the battlefield, whether or not the men cheered Lee right before Pickett's Charge, etc. I think those errors are there mainly because this movie is based on a work of fictional drama, the book \\"The Killer Angels\\", by Michael Shaara.<br />I loved Tom Berenger as General Longstreet, absolutely adored Jeff Daniels as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Sam Elliot as General Buford, and thought Kevin Conway's portrayal of the fictional \\"Kilrain\\", was stupendous! Richard Jordan's final performance as General Armisted, is compassionate and fantastic. I didn't like Martin Sheen cast as General Lee, I think he did as good a job as he could have, but wouldn't have cast his as Lee in a million years! I have recently read that Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones had been considered for that role, and would have loved to see either as Lee, than Sheen.<br />One other note, there is a \\"long version\\" of \\"Gettysburg\\", that has something like an additional 20-25 minutes of footage that was edited from it. I think that this version is even better, especially for those who aren't as well informed as to the specifics of the battle, as these 20-25 minutes fill in what is not said in the official release.<br />But, all in all, check out this film, as it is decidedly an excellent effort by the director, Ronald Maxwell. The musical score by Randy Edelman, is stupendous!!!!!<br />Also, look for cameos by Ken Burns, Ted Turner, and Brian Pohanka.film, as it is decidedly an excellent effort by the director, Ronald Maxwell.

B00005K3LU|5.0|It's Christmas Eve in Los Angeles -- but at Nakatomi Plaza in Century City, none of the Nakatomi Corporation's dedicated employees have gone home to their families.  Nope, they're all at the office, enjoying a lavish party courtesy of company funding, and breaking now and then for a little work.  Every other business in town has knocked off for the night, that Special Night, but not so at Nakatomi.  And when Bruce Willis shows up, his estranged wife Holly happens to be away in another room, &quot;faxing some documents&quot; -- presumably to the home office in Japan where, on the other side of the international date line, it's already Christmas morning... meaning that in Japan, somebody is at the office on Christmas morning awaiting Holly's fax from Los Angeles.  Such industry !!<br />This sort of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day work ethic is absolutely magnificent.  If everyone in the world would devote that degree of dedication to his/her job, our planet would run in greased grooves !!
B00000AF98|5.0|Crazy Nights is one of the best KISS albums that KISS have done -<BR>in The USA the hitsingle &quot;Crazy Crazy Nights&quot; was not such a big hit as it was in Europe (#3 in UK), probably because KISS did a lot of shows in Europe this time (Monsters of Rock,...).<BR>This album also includes a great ballad &quot;Reason to live&quot; &amp; some more great songs like I`ll fight hell to hold you, Turn on the night, Good girl gone bad, WHen your walls come down &amp; Hell or high water. Unfortunally KISS currently are not playing any of these songs on the tour.
B0000640VO|5.0|This film is superb.  The use of colors throughout the story add to the other-dimensional quality -- it transports you into a modern day faerie story.  The film follows Chaos Theory and Possibly Divine Intervention.  And let's face it, Audrey Tautou is adorable.  Every movement and expression is pure gold.  She sprinkles pixie dust with glee throughout the film...  and we are allowed to see inside her.  We are allowed to see when she is not all flirts and giggles.  This film is a must see for fans of French cinema and especially all who loved The City of Lost Children.
B000001F5A|4.0|This soundtrack to the little known Japanese documentary about sled dogs left behind to fend for themselves is one of my favorite CDs. I have the vinyl album as well from when it first came out. The movie was shown on HBO at obscure times, and someone taped it for me. It's true that the movie itself lacks a great deal, but you'll never forget Vangelis' haunting music. <br />As a composer, Vangelis has clearly grown and expanded since he did this. But you can tell even here that his ear for melodic beauty and simplicity is ever present. Either you have it or you don't, and Vangelis has it in spades. The music evokes the contrasts of this frozen wasteland: bitter cold, icy landscapes, moments of intense beauty amid the stark isolation. <br />If you're a fan of Vangelis' much more famous Chariots of Fire (as I was as a teen), you'll like this even more. I never tire of listening to it.
B00005ATQF|2.0|Compare Stanley Kubrick's early masterpiece \\"Paths of Glory\\" with the turgid and vacant \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" and you have a pretty clear picture of the magnitude of the director's decline after \\"2001.\\"  Apart from some of the worst acting he ever directed, the film is rife with the neurotic obsessions that overcame Kubrick in middle age.  He would not, for instance, cross so much a body of water as the English Channel to film at more convenient locations in Spain, but instead inflated his budget by having his idea of Vietnam built on English stages.  In the end he was so discouraged by the final product he didn't make another film for 12 years.  Anybody wanting a clear idea of what the Vietnam War was all about is going to have to look elsewhere; and if you want to see why Kubrick was once thought to be the best American director of his generation, check any of his films from 1968 backward.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I've always loved Chris Cornells voice, so to hear it teamed up with Tom Morello's incredible &amp; unique guitar playing.....what more could you want.<BR>Great record !
B00005QCVY|5.0|One of the best features of DVD, of course, is the ability to jump straight to certain scenes instead of searching endlessly through tape. This movie is full of scenes that people love to watch over and over: George saving Harry from drowning; young George and Mary at the ice cream counter; the aquatic Charleston contest; the honeymoon money distributed to the Building and Loan customers; the list goes on and on. This movie was wonderful before -- but with this ability to go straight to the scene you want, it's even better.
B000002JAX|5.0|I bought this CD based on the reviews here and was not disappointed. She has a voice reminiscent of Billie Holiday, but she doesn't sound like she's trying to copy her.<BR>Great Jazz/Blues sound that is different from many of today's artists.<br />It's amazing that someone so young has such an interesting voice
B00005ABX0|3.0|So, what can I say? Smiley Smile simply isn't good.  Sure, it has a couple of great songs like Heroes and Villains and some of the other Smile songs, but the rest of the album ranges from interesting to downright annoying.  Fortunately the album is almost saved by one of the best songs ever, Good Vibrations.  That alone pushes up the rating by two stars.  Even though I really love that song, I'm not sure if it makes up for the rest of the garbage.  You could certainly get G V on a different album and make a much more pleasing investment.<br />Wild Honey, on the other hand, is tolerable.  Some of the songs are really well done and the band seemed to be more together than on Smiley.  It is certainly an improvement and a step in a new direction.  <br />All in all, this album is worth having, but don't expect any comparison to Pet Sounds or Smile.  Maybe, if Pet Sounds hadn't been released I would have a little more respect for these albums.  It is truly sad that Smile was never finished, even if it was all hype, it would certainly have blown the pants off of it's replacement.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Rashomon is a great cinematic feat.  Filmed in 1950 and released here in the states in '51, it was very ahead of it's time.  Akira Kurosawa, probably best known here in the states for The Seven Samarai, creates a puzzling movie that the mind can't help but ponder over long after the movie is finished.<br />The simple plot is about three people.  A warrior, his wife and a bandit.  The wife is raped, the warrior is murdered and the bandit is captured.  The story is being narrated to us by two men, a woodsman and a priest, both who witnessed not only parts of the crime but also the testimony of the wife, the bandit and even the warrior (via a medium) in court.  <br />What this movie eventually becomes is an experiment on truth and reality. As all the testimonies contradict each other, we begin to doubt each person's reality.  The story is told 5 different times, none of them in agreement, and what we begin to realize is that Kurosawa is trying to show us how our reality is altered by our perceptions.<br />The extras on the DVD are great, Criterion has succeeded again in putting together a great deal of extras that add to a movie that would easily stand on its own.  Robert Altman introduces the movie, and talks about why the movie is one of his favorites.  Also, a Kurasawa expert, Donald Richie, has recorded a commentary that helps the viewer really appreciate the subtle nuances of Rashomon, little points like how much silent film influenced Kurosawa.<br />This movie is a classic and has influenced film makers in the states for years.  Once you see it, you too can't help but be influenced by it.

B00005JLZL|1.0|I have never seen such a waste of talent before in a film before.  We see Kevin Spacey playing the same role he's played a million times, then we have sell out Kate Winslet with a bad American accent and the same facial expression throughout the entire film.  The only good thing about this movie is Laura Linney's performance.  Avoid this Hollywood tripe at all costs!
B00004TJLD|4.0|This is probably my most favorite overall album.  When I bought this, the description said DVD-Audio, so I got it.  I was disappointed to find out that this is NOT a DVD-Audio disk, but a DVD \\"video\\" disk (no pictures, though) making use of the DVD video standard that allows a 96/24 PCM audio stream to be used.  So, do not buy this if you are expecting 5.1 DVD-Audio sound.<br />That said, the audio on this is very good, and is better than the regular CD.  I played it last night and it sounded great!
B000021YQV|5.0|... how does it compare with their first? there are three differences. the first difference is that the first one is a lot darker and controversial, and with those characteristics comes bad language, which toxicity has none. (that was what made me think they had sold out, removing the language to make it more \\"radio friendly\\") the second difference is that daron (the guitarist) backs up on the vocals a lot, whereas he only did this once on the first album. the third difference is that tankian's vocals change as well. on the first album, he had five different voice ranges: opera-style (my favorite), top-of-his-lungs yelling, death-growling/screaming, nasal-sounding, and a type of talk-singing which is really hard to describe. on toxicity, he does away with the opera-style, talk-singing, and death-growl, and sings almost nothing but the nasal voice (the yelling plays a pretty big part too). this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it cuts down on the band's creativity. ... i can only hope opera-style comes back. (plus, serj does this thing where he rolls his \\"r\\"'s, and i really like that because of its originality. on toxicity it is done a lot, but on steal this album it is almost nowhere to be found, which i hope is not a sign of things to come.) despite the differences, toxicity is still as good, and maybe even better ... than their first cd. <br /> lyrically, this cd is top notch. it is mostly abstract poetry put to music, but all of their songs have meanings, some are just hard to decipher. musically, this cd is incredibly creative, with insanely inventive guitar riffs, vocals, and drum beats.  shavo does a great job on the bass, john beats his drums mercilessly and crazily, daron shows master crafswork on the guitar, and serj pens thought-provoking lyrics and sings beautifully throughout. and without much further ado, here is my song-by-song rundown:<br />1. Prison Song- very hard, heavy, thrash-sounding song, with a repitive chorus and less-than-wonderful vocals... 5 out of 10<br />2. Needles- another dark, hard song, with some more thrash, but this one is good. ... 8 out of 10<br />3. Deer Dance- yet another very hard song, with yet another thrash intro, but not quite as dark... 9 out of 10.<br />5. X- not a great song, not a bad song, but nothing special. very hard, with a slayer-type sound in the verses, but really not very inventive. ... 5.5 out of 10<br />6. Chop Suey!- this is where the album strays a little from the thrash genre, and a little to just rock. awesome song, with just a total mish-mash of acoustic guitars, mandolins, and pounding drums and insane guitars. ... 10 out of 10<br />7. Bounce- goofy, \\"bouncy\\" song. hilariously irreverent chorus supposedly about a pogo stick, and metaphorical verses. ... 8 out of 10<br />8. Forest- hard song with slower chorus, and fast paced verses. neat intro with bongos, and overall a very cool song. great middle part that strays from the chorus but has great guitar riffs. ... 9 out of 10<br />9. ATWA- somewhat controversial song, i guess. it is about charles manson (yes, the murderer) and is a first-person narrative of how he sees the world. ...9 out of 10<br />10. Science- one of the softer songs on the cd, with an amazing intro. a lot of \\"r\\" rolling and an awesome middle eastern solo in the middle with the help of their musical genious friend, arto. ... 10 out of 10<br />11. Shimmy- serj wrote this song all by himself, and is the only s.o.a.d. song that he did. ... 8 out of 10.<br />12. Toxicity- the best s.o.a.d. song ever. great choice for the title track. incredible intro with perfectly harmonized drums and guitar. awesome chorus, beautiful and haunting verses. a perfect song, through and through. the vocals are superb, and the end is tight. ...10 out of 10.<br />13. Psycho- another goofy, bouncy song that sounds a lot like Bounce. great guitar all the way through, from the hard, repetive chorus riff to the middle-eastern sounding, quiet verse riffs to the beautiful solo at the end. ... 10 out of 10.<br /> i only have one minor complaint about this great album. the song arrangement is kind of weirs, since the first 5 songs are pretty much pure thrash, and then there really isn't any more. plus, all of the good songs are at the end (the radio released ones were 6, 12, 13, 14). but still, this is definately one of the best albums ever. just treat it as an individual album and don't worry about comparing it to their others, because like the band, it is unique. (that's what i learned) it is a must, must have....
0698119347|3.0|Stormbreaker was a fast and mildly engaging read. Although it did not have a lasting impression, it was fun while it lasted. I thought that many elements of the story where rushed and the plot was neglecting and misguiding. The content of the story was very childish and more prone to be enjoyed by a younger audience.
B000069HK2|2.0|Where to begin. I absolutely hate this band. It's one thing to completely jump on the bandwagon of this simply dirivative band, but everytime someone goes on and on about how &quot;original&quot; and &quot;awesome&quot; this band is I think, Give me a break! I liked this band in their much superior form named Glassjaw. Glassjaw is the band that should be getting your attention, NOT THE USED! Half of you out there probably only like this band because of Kelly Osborne and just want to think you are cool. Now before you all start hating me, I'm not talking to all of you. If you have never heard of any REAL emocore bands and The Used is the only one you have been forced to endure, then I suggest you dig deeper and find something with more substance. You can thank me later.

(\\"When Harry Met Sally\\" and \\"You've Got Mail\\" were really good.) This movie I hated. <br />I as I sat through this movie, I had an overwhelming feeling that I was being played. This movie was made for the sole purpose of making people cry. Not that it had a story to tell, just string together as many sad events as you can in two hours. It was heavy-handed and insulting. If you liked this movie, watch it again and then tell me the reason why. <br />...\\"Joe vs. the Volcano\\" was a more romantic and beautiful movie than this, and it was just plain silly; but at least it didn't ask to be taken seriously.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Extensive hits compilation of this group that made amazing songs in the most different kinds of style. Each one of their songs is pure pleasure. My favorite songs actually are all of them together, but especially Dreaming&quot;, The Tide Is High&quot;, Hanging On The Telephone&quot;, Rapture&quot;, Picture This&quot;, Union City Blue&quot; and Island Of Lost Souls&quot;. Very recommendable is also the corresponding live album Blondie Live&quot;.

B00001OH80|5.0|One of many good studio albums of this opalescent musician. Some of the songs David Bowie has written together with Iggy Pop.  Both of them have made their own version of the songs. Whereas the versions of Iggy Pop are rough and tough, the versions of David Bowie are finer and more polished. Both of them have their charm. My favorite songs are Don't Look Down\\",  Tonight\\", Neighborhood Threat\\", Blue Jean\\" and Dancing With The Big Boys\\".
0446677450|1.0|I've probably read over 100 books on economics, trading, business, and investing, and I think this book will satisfy a lot of people that need to be motivated to take more responsibilty for their financial education, and become informed on some common sense things, like:<br />1. Don't buy the biggest house you can afford, thinking you will get rich.<BR>2. More people become wealthy by owning their own businesses (or business interests, like real estate) than by working for someone else.<BR>3. It is better to increase income and reduce expenses to become more financially independent (there is a really cool little diagram that shows that income is money that actually goes into your bank account, but expenses are money that leaves you!).<BR>4. Its up to you to go to other sources (books, seminars, mentors) to get an education, and develop a plan that will work for you.<br />I think that people that are already motivated, and already have even the most basic understanding of money management and economics, will think of this book as chewing gum for the mind. It really doesn't offer much other than a boastful motivational lecture.<br />At least one reviewer has mentioned the debate over the author's credibility, and I've read a few articles and postings about that. Although I think there may be a credibility issue, I don't think it should impact the reader who has the most to gain from this book (i.e., motivation, not a plan for success). Regardless, its a quick and easy read (enabling you to move on to a good book sooner).
B000005RYQ|5.0|Magnificent hits compilation of a magnificent group. The songs are very rhythmic, dynamic and pleasing. Sting, the singer and bass player, has a unique voice.

THAT's only the beginning. \\"It\\" is played by the brilliant Meryl Streep - [makes Norma Desmond look like Maria Von Trapp] A cautionary caustic tale of \\"Hollywood has-almost-famous Beings\\" seen through the eyes of director Robert Zemeckis. Wonderful one-liners along the lines of \\"She'd go to the Opening of an Envelope!\\" [the fabulous Goldie Hawn re. Ms. Streep's vixenish star], and the gut-rumbling \\"NOW A Warning??\\" Streep to Isabella Rossellini as the vampish immortal - after consuming the all-life-giving potion.<br />It's a TREMENDOUS onyx comedy about Tinsel Town and its dark little secrets - JUST a PITY that the current DVD version is so bland - NOT in wide screen and no extras worth mentioning - especially the spectacular special effects, make-up etc. etc. etc.<br />Very underrated - highly recommended and due for a rebirth as a SUPERBIT special edition!!
B000002GLE|5.0|Jazz inspired live recordings of songs mainly from Stings first solo album The Dream Of The Blue Turtles&quot;. The musicians are in best form and very playful. Most of all I like the medleys, especially One World (Not Three)/Love Is The Seventh Wave&quot;. The songs are not only coupled to each other, but woven in each other. Mind-blowing! There is also a video of the same title worth seeing, about how this concert tour was made to happen.

0316666343|1.0|The book grabs you in right away and then takes you down a spiral of nothingness.  I got sucked in and fell all the way down to the bottom - help!! Somebody get me out.  I did finish the book, much to my regret.  I kept hoping it would come back and give me a reason for the interest I had in the beginning.  Sorry to say it never gave me a hint. Don't waste your time.
B00005Q66Y|5.0|I have followed Gunther Wand's recordings of this symphony since the Koln radio lp set back in the 70's (I believe). In all respects this is his finest account -- and certainly the best recorded. Add the lustre and burnished brilliance of the Berlin Philharmonic and this joins a select, and surprisingly large, group of performances: Haitink/Vienna, Giulini/Vienna, von Karajan/Vienna, Boulez/Vienna -- and getting away from the Danube at last! Chailly/Concertgebouw and now Wand/Berlin.<br />I have special affection for von Karajan's Berlin account for EMI in 1958 -- the only stereo 8th at that time, and one of only four recordings of the symphony available at all! We have come a long way in our appreciation of the unique symphonic vision Bruckner offers the world. This recording by Wand and the Berliners contributes mightily to that vision.
B000002J1Y|5.0|This was my 2nd Yes record after &quot;Fragile&quot; when I was 11 years old, and I was happy to find it on CD-I literally wore my albums out!<br />One of the great live albums of all time, in fact, I heard Yessongs before I heard the studio versions of many of their songs, and it took some getting used to when I finally heard the studio tracks.  <br />You can feel the excitement building during the Stravinsky opening, and then they SLAM you into a smoking Siberian Khatru with that amazing guitar line. The versions of Starship Trooper, Close to the Edge, Yours Is No Disgrace,and And You And I are just wonderful, and Roundabout is a killer too-(Don't forget it was new in 1973!) In fact, all of the classics are here, along with the outstanding solo pieces and the beautiful harmonies. <br />Unfortunately I did not get to see Yes live in those days, but I can just imagine what it must have been like from this recording. So happy it is preserved in all its glory. When I bought this recently, I had not heard it in a long time, (My turntable being long gone), but playing this CD set brought it all back in an instant.  A wonderful introduction to Yes for anyone who is new to them.<br />I did get the pleasure of seeing them live twice last year, they still sound as fresh and wonderful as ever, and in fact are still playing many of these songs-Rock On, boys!
B000059ZLH|4.0|Great DVD just missing two things from the live album. Another Day and Metopolis pt 1 are greatly missed
B000069AUI|4.0|Comparisons to Radiohead are obvious, but not necessarily accurate.  True, they seem to take some of the stylings.  Yet the lead singer does not wield his voice as an instrument rather than a rendering of words.  The lyrics do not spew angst and metaphors.  <br />Yet despite this, this is a very good album.  Memorable melodies abound.  Lots of emotional involvement.  Lots of variety.  Never a dull moment.  There are several very good songs on here, certainly in line with some of my favorite albums.  There seems to be a recurring theme of loneliness and regret relating to a lost love, and hope for renewal of that love.  Their strength for me is in the writing of music and emotional involvement of the lead singer. <br />Highly recommended.<br />If they can make some truly meaningful lyrics for their next album, there is no question where they can go.

B00005JKZT|3.0|Today marks the second time I have seen The Two Towers, and I continue to be amazed by what the special effects team was able to accomplish, especially with Treebeard.  When he first opened his eyes, I thought \\"Now that's cool!\\"  The Dead Marshes (viewed from both above and below the surface of the water) also freaked me out.  The performances were all well done (if I ever have a major undertaking, I hope I have someone like Sam to help me get through it), but I did miss Sean Bean (at least I still had Orlando Bloom -who actually gets a decent amount of lines this time around- and Viggo Mortensen to satisfy my aesthetic needs).<BR>As a movie, I liked it a lot.  As an adaptation of the second installment of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, however, I found it lacking, which is why I only gave it two and a half stars.<BR>I consider myself a pretty strong Tolkien purist, but went into the movie understanding that certain things would be changed/deleted (like Tom Bombadil in Fellowship) to either tighten up the narrative or save time.  But like others have already said in their reviews, I cannot not forgive the way Peter Jackson and his fellow scriptwriters completely destroyed the character of Faramir, especially because there was absolutely no point to it.  Tolkien described him as having the blood of Numenor flowing through his veins, which puts him on pretty much the same level nobility-wise as Aragorn.  He is supposed to be a man of the highest quality and a direct contrast to his brother Boromir, who was unable to withstand the temptation of the Ring.  Faramir's characterization alone made me deduct 1 star from the movie.<BR>I took off another half-star just because of other plot changes that annoyed me, such as the Ents not seeming to know what was going on with the trees they have the ability to communicate with, Eomer being pretty much deleted when in the book he has a significant part (I felt bad for Karl Urban, who could have had a lot more screen time), the Elves showing up at Helm's Deep (and why did they have to bump off Haldir?), Aragorn's trip over the cliff, and having Saruman possessing Theoden.<BR>The scenes with Aragorn, Arwen and Elrond, and the Osgiliath sequence also cost the movie one star in my mind because they took up valuable time that could have been used to actually include some important, vital events in the plot of the second book - the confrontation between Gandalf and Saruman at Isengard with the turnover of the palantir, and the appearance of Shelob causing the capture of Frodo by the orcs.  I felt differently about the inclusion of Boromir's death in Fellowship because it kept the events of that battle together instead of breaking them up into two films.  But I'm just afraid about what this means for the third movie's plot, because Return of the King is a packed enough book already without adding in extra stuff from The Two Towers.  The movie version of Return of the King looks to be either five hours long or suffering from major plot excisions.  Maybe if they put in another teaser trailer at the end of The Two Towers when it's almost done in the theatres (like they did with Fellowship), there will be some clues.
B00003CXXM|3.0|Why, I must ask, did the film producers bother to purchase the rights to Ludlum's novel if they weren't planning on using any of it?  The movie retains only the slightest similarity to the original, far more complex and interesting, novel.  I suspect I would have enjoyed this movie more if it hadn't pretended to be based on a novel I've read and enjoyed.  It's good enough as a spy story, but it's not The Bourne Identity.
B0000024YL|5.0|No this is NOT a definitive collection of S &amp; G but it is invaluable because of the four live tracks which you can't get anywhere else. The great thing about these live versions is that you can hear Art's vocal harmonies much more clearly than in the studio versions, I'm thinking here especially of 'Homeward Bound' and '59th St. Bridge Song'. <BR>In my opinion the live versions of 'Emily', 'Kathy's Song' and '59th St. Bridge Song' on this CD surpass the studio versions, THAT'S why you need this collection.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Rock and roll is back on this superalbum.  If you miss Soundgarden or were smashed by the breakup of Rage, get this album.  If you love rock, get this album -- this is your tonic.  Chris Cornell and Rage fuse to produce songs with an incredible power.  Tom and crew slam with a laser focus on tight tight songs.  Chris adds incisive lyrics that sometimes feel as though they've opened your chest up instead of his.  If think you'll  miss Zack's political insights (and it's ok to), know Chris will shine a light on the inside of humanity that would make Plato proud.<br />Have a great time and buy this album.  It's a listener from start to finish.
B0000039PW|5.0|Great lyrics, great songs, maybe not as much of a classic as some other great East Coast rap albums like Eric B &amp; Rakim's &quot;Paid In Full&quot; or Nas' &quot;Illmatic&quot;.

0618001905|5.0|Adam Hochschild's book is a grim reminder of what can happen, and is probably still going on in some form, when we accept without question what our leaders, be they political or economic, are doing in our country's name. The sad events of the \\"rubber terror\\" that went on for so many years in the Congo are brought to life on the pages of \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" as we learn about historical figures and a few lesser known people. This is the type of book that captures you not only because of the historical significance of that period, but because of the way we are drawn to the characters and their lives. Some were despicable in so many ways that we can hardly believe the atrocities that they committed. We think that Hitler and Stalin were were evil incarnate, but once we finish reading this book we realize that   the foundation of the Belgian Congo was set on the blood of millions of innocent Africans. <BR>        If you are interested in Africa and the colonial harm that was done to that continent, you must read this book.
0312305060|5.0|I was surprised that I did not tire of the writing style, which is immediate rather than linear.  I expected to tire of the characters, each of whom struggles in her own way with being conscious and aware of each hour she lives.<br />I was, instead, fascinated, as though I were watching a kalideoscope composed of each character's experience of each small segment of her daily life.  I believe such immediate and ongoing conscious awareness and focus is the stuff of art.  In ordinary reality, such perceptions are subconscious most of the time, with our awareness only coming on line occasionally.<br />Although each of their lives is poignant, I didn't feel sorry for any of the characters; I admired their perception and their courage in responding to the circumstances of their lives.<br />The ending surprised me (the last chapter).  I haven't decided yet if I like the relationships of the characters being literally tied together as they were.  It jolted me out of the atmosphere of the rest of the book.<br />Regardless of the ending, I highly recommend this novel.
B00005AAFS|4.0|I've been a fan of Rammstein since I first hear &quot;Heirete Mich&quot; and &quot;Rammstein&quot; on David Lynch's Lost Highway soundtrack. After Sehnsucht, I'd been waiting a long time for some new Rammstein material, and Mutter doesn't disappoint. It starts out quite surprisingly with &quot;Mein Herz Brennt,&quot; which begins with a short spoken word intro and breaks into a soaring chorus, complete with a majestic string section. When I first heard the strings, I was shocked in a good way. Rammstein has grown a lot from the aggro industrial metal of Herzeleid, and the new album features a lot of slower tempos, as well as some much more standard fast paced Rammstein tunes.<br />After &quot;Mein Herz Brennt&quot; is &quot;Links 234,&quot; a song that is a lot more in line with the first two albums. It's faster and more of a fist pumping anthem along the lines of &quot;Asche zu Asche&quot; and &quot;Bück Dich.&quot; After that is &quot;Sonne,&quot; a song that is quite heavy but with a riff that plays out in a slower, more satisfying pace. &quot;Ich Will&quot; shows a strong industrial edge to it, almost bordering on techno, after which they once again return to their roots on &quot;Feuer Frei!,&quot; probably the heaviest of the songs on the disc. <br />The title track, &quot;Mutter&quot; is a soaring and epic song, and it is also one of the best they're ever recorded and quite possibly the highlight of the album. &quot;Spieluhr&quot; is a bit of a strange song, also starting with a short spoken word section, and featuring a strong bass line that carries the song and children singing in the chorus. After this comes &quot;Zwitter&quot; and &quot;Rein Raus,&quot; two songs that return to the strange lyrical style of songs like &quot;Weisses Fleisch&quot; and &quot;Klavier.&quot; &quot;Zwitter&quot; truly is hilarious if you have a working knowledge of German or find a translation. &quot;Adios&quot; still often takes me by surprise when I listen to it, starting outvery quietly and serenely and exploding into an almost thrash metal like riff. The album ends with &quot;Nebel,&quot; a ballad that is simply beautiful.<br />There isn't a weak song on the entire disc, and only the most aggro Rammstein fans won't love it. It's a perfect addition to any industrial fan's music collection.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I have only recently become a fan of Seinfeld since I got cable. It was soon after my obsession with the show began, that I discovered it was no longer being made. I then discovered that although the show has gained little air time (other than a nightly slot at 12 o'clock on BBC 2) over here in merry old england that it was very popular in America and still is with several showings a day. I then came to the obvious conclusion that such a show would surely have been released on VHS format at least. But no. And why the he[ck] not, there are so many people that would love to posess a copy of the brilliant antics of Seinfeld and his buddies. The show cant just be continued to be shown once a day until it is inevitably replaced by further episodes of Dharma and :( Greg or even worse, Mad About You-oh the horror. The show deserves a permanent lodgement in every fans home and if the people behind it dont see that then I would like an explanation as to why they feel the need to torment me like this.
6305069611|4.0|This is a great movie for the Sci-fi and lovers of alien encounters.  Since it was filmed back in the late 70's it has aged surprisingly well. The plot follows a visitor Thomas Jerome Newton (David Bowie) from another planet on a well thought out survival plan to bring water back to his drought stricken planet. Early on in the film you can appreciate just how much care and planning has gone into the aliens only hope for survival, from having numerous engraved \\"wedding rings\\" to pawn to build up working capital to filing for patents on alien technology. Although there isn't a clear indication of the passage of time you get the feeling of the story spanning decades. David Bowie's character becomes more and more reclusive yet ever pushing towards his goal.  The alien's plan is on track and is perhaps too successful when it draws the attention of some powerful business interests.  Things start to go awry as the visitor is tempted and slowly drawn into the vices of humans. Sex and alcohol slowly and irrevocably corrupt the already isolated alien.  Just when he is about to achieve his goal and thereby rescue his dying planet he is betrayed and his friends and allies are stripped from him to leave him isolated trapped more by his vices than a locked door.  Here you get the impression of the advance of time, as his remaining friends grow old while he remains the same age. <br />\\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\" has a very isolated and depressing feeling to it. The visual impression is raw and gritty; it leads the viewer towards the plot rather than distracting them. There are some disturbing visuals in this movie like realistic vomiting but the violence in the film is used as a valid vehicle for the plot. There is also a fair sprinkling of nudity including Candy Clark, David Bowie and a full frontal nudity of a lecherous collage professor (Rip Torn) as he is seen replaying the same sex scene with numerous female collage students.<br />\\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\" is a film you have to pay attention to fully enjoy it and it is worth viewing a few times to get all plot devices.
B000063COX|4.0|Iron maiden's debut album in my opinon is the best one they did. Don't get me wrong, the early dickinson era was good too, but they had all the raw energy and emotion in the first and second.<BR>For example, phantom of the opera. The opening bass line with guitar is one of the hardest pieces of music to play. They had alot more variety too, with songs like charlotte the harlot, running free, and remember tomorrow,just to name a few. I also am a bass player, and in my opinon steve harris' bass lines are alot better(and tricker too). <BR>   You can almost sit down and listen to the whole album through, and not get bored. You can hear alot of early eighty's british wave in some (running free), which I'm not thrilled about, but it is rare to find a bleak moment in it all. If you have not heard it, trust me, buy it. You'll thank me. If you have heard it, buy it again anyway, renew your worn out copy. Drffently for all the old school rockers who have it on vinyl. Up the iron's!
B00006LFGD|5.0|Barbra Streisand has a greatest hits CD every 2 years.At least this one makes sense.You have to give this  artist credit for singing with the BEST there is,including herself(On Less Bell To  Answer/A House Is Not A Home)The new single,&quot;I won't be the one to Let Go,&quot; with Barry Manilow,is a wonderfull record,about 2 lovers growing old together,and STAYING together.Alot of the 19tracks were HUGE HITS,My Favorites,&quot;Guilty,What Kind of Fool,&quot; with Barry Gibb.(These 2 singles have been on a Barbra Streisand record 14 times)I would love for Barbra and Barry to work again on a NeW CD.I also enjoyed the Bryan Adams duet,&quot;I finally found someone,&quot; that Barbra Co-wrote with Bryan.(Hey Barbra!!Your next album can be songs written by you)The Diamond of the album is the Judy Garland duet,&quot;Get Happy/Happy days are here again.&quot; This was Judy Garlands idea.Mel Torme' came into Judys  dressing room while she was getting ready for her weekly show,and she was singing to Barbra's hit,&quot;Happy days are here again,&quot; along with her classic,&quot;Get Happy.&quot; Another song I've always enjoyed is the Don Johnson duet,&quot;Till I loved you.&quot; Alot of people put down his singing,but I think he did a fantastic job.After hearing this record,your amazed at this ARTIST history,singing with Judy Garland,Frank Sinatra,Harold Arlen,Donna Summers,Celin Dion,Josh Groban,and so many other wonderfull singers.Finally a Barbra Streisand greatest hits CD that makes sense.
B00006L83N|5.0|Since I'm already a huge fan of this incredible band, all I can say is this: If you're into progressive metal, then BUY THIS CD! Hell, buy ALL THEIR CD's!<br />Excellent musicianship, extremely awesome time signatures, very nice lyrics, very nice vocals, and WILD guitar playing by Michael Romeo, as usual. :)<br />Picture a guitarist with a unique combined playing style of both Yngwie & Steve Vai, placed smack in the middle of a truly unique progressive metal band, and there you have Symphony-X. <br />Some might say this band reminds them of a heavier Dream Theatre. I would tend to agree. But, I like Symphony-X way better. :)<br />If you're a fan of such bands as: Nightwish, In Flames, Dream Theatre, Blind Guardian, Kamelot, Stratavarius, Yngwie, Vai, Satriani...etc, you should absolutely LOVE Symphony-X.
B00006WUWP|5.0|I TOTALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE, AND I MUST HAVE LAUGHED HARDEST AT THIS SEQUEL THAN THE OTHER TWO, ALTHOUGH I AM A DIEHARD AUSTIN POWERS FAN.

MIKE MYERS IS A GENIUS AND I HOPE HE KEEPS MAKING AUSTIN POWERS MOVIES FOREVER.  IF YOU READ THESE REVIEWS, MIKE, WHY DON'T YOU MAKE ANOTHER AUSTIN SEQUEL WHERE WAYNE MEETS AUSTIN IN THE '80s?  AUSTIN HAS TO GO BACK TO THE 80s - HE CAN GO FUNK OR NEW WAVE.  KEEP AUSTIN GOING!
B00006RIO7|4.0|I loved this show from the date of the original and was lucky enought to see Liza Minnelli fill in for Gwen Verdon when she was ill.<BR>The album is teriffic, except for the [reprehensible] \\"rap\\" songs at the end. What an insult to Kander and Ebb's original and lively score. Buy the album and burn a copy on your computer sans track 17 and 18. They should have included the ending credits music instead. The revival album is still the best, my apologies to Chita (who is wonderful)
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is no teen album.  The material is very well thought out and incredibly well sung.  Christina may have the best voice on the pop circuit today and I think it shows in this album.  While I admit there is one song (Get Mine, Get Yours) that I'm not a fan of, the album was so well done overall that I'd still recommend it over any other album I've heard in years.
B000062TU1|4.0|The wonderous world of Harry Potter opens up through the enchanted pages of J.K. Rowling's books, as veritable grimoires masked in fictional charicatures, but demonstrating subtle magical principles. The books come to life in a veritable bibliomancy - the words vibrate, a Magical glow emminates therefrom, & the pictures come to brilliant life, jumping forth from the pages in dynamic enchanted exhuberance. And thus it has been for those who have enjoyed these wonderful works.<br />These have served to stimulate, & sometimes even enhance the child-like Magic residing within - that charm personafied in animals & children, & preserved by The Magician.<br />I have found this film a marvel to behold, although I feel it could have been twice the production had it been a tad darker, as the books have tended to be. Unfortunately, producers felt that the initial more gothicesque aesthetics would frighten children, to whom the film is primarily directed towards. But I question the excessive over-sheltering of children would only raise a populace of mollycoddles. Speaking for Myself on the left hand, I have always been attracted to the darkest subject matter since I was a very young child. The pervasive fascination for blood & gore in western society is due to the lack of real-life bloodletting spectacles, practices, & traditions in modern culture. In many societies, a boy was not considered a man until until he had killed his first prey in the hunt, or slain an enemy. Western Society compensates for this natural bloodlust with horror movies & documentaries, to stimulate that latently essential primal part of the psyche which remains far too under-stimulated.<br />The first half of the movie seemed aesthetically darker, whereas the second half was a bit 'lighter', probably as a result of the puscillanimousness of Chris Columbus {who also directed \\"Home Alone\\" as an indication}. I believe a film of this callibre would have been better directed by the likes of Tim Burton, who has consistently brought forth the dark sides of the characters he has worked with, & created films of magnificent & gloriously gothic proportions, as Batman would be a major example; with a musickal score conducted instead by Danny Elfman, considering the current score unfortunately sounds rather tired & redundant - not one of John William's better works. It just seemed that he did not place too much effort into it, yet it still remains memorable, but so much more could have been done with it.<br />I found the effects to be quite well done, concurrent with the descriptions in the book. There were several scnes which were curtailed for time, but I have a feeling the release of the video / DVD wil divulge many deleted scenes.<br />A most poignant scene was towards the end, whcen Potter comes face to face with Voldemort, in which he states, \\"There is no good or evil, only Power & those who seek it. Those who do not, are weak.\\" Quite a Satanic statement!<br />The release of this movie will probably inspire some children to gain an interest in The Occult, & will create A.C.I.'s in many, & just may serve to open the door to self-realization in true infernal progeny yet unknown. A movie of this type I feel is timely, & necessitates \\"popularity\\" in this select case, to help contribute to that societal shift in the Satanic direction.<br />Besides that one moment of the stating of Satanic fact, there is no weakan sactimony, no xian drivel, just plain fun \\"witchcraft\\" for the whole family.<br />The idea of a \\"School of Witchcraft and Wizardry\\" does sound rather appealing {notice the distinction between the genders} - the closest thing we have to that is the homeschooling initiative which is espoused by most Satanists. Speaking for Myself, I have schooled Myself in The Dark Arts, incorperating & experimenting with what I will to determine My own personal philosophies & rites {Draconian Satanism}, & I do consider Dr. LaVey My Daemon-Mentor. And now, as \\"grownup\\" Witches & Warlocks, Our Infernal Progeny may have the benefit of Our tutoring.<br />Overall, I found the film to be visually stunning, relevant to the book, & it displayed a higher class of diction & politeness, serving as a good example to the more bereft & vulgar infesting the current populace. Recommended.Warlocks, Our Infernal Progeny may have the benefit of Our tutoring. <br />Overall, I found the film to be visually stunning, relevant to the book, & it displayed a higher class of diction & politeness, serving as a good example to the more bereft & vulgar infesting the current populace.

0316666343|5.0|This book was a great read from the moment I picked it up.  I really enjoyed how Susie was so open about what happened to her, yet she spoke in a way that did not make the murder scary.

Noone knows what heaven is like, but I certainly hope I get to choose my own.  ...  <br />A must read!
B00006AFF5|3.0|I have long since enjoyed this little tale about a hermit living high up on mountaintop overlooking Whoville in dusgust. I recently accompanied a young cousin, & had the opportunity to view this latest presentation, & though it is rather slow in the beginning, it really picks up after Little Sarah Loohoo invites The Grinch to receive an award down in town. A request made by the Mayor triggers a memory sequence in which the Grinch experiencd some rather traumatic events in his childhood, & all Hell breaks loose after that. He serves in his capacity as villain, as revealing the programmed habits of the townspeople who celebrate xmas, motivated by nothing more than greed. The Grinch asks the question, \\"is that all xmas means to you?\\" This sheds a luciferic light on them all, revealing them for the money & gift-hungry drones that the are. In a particularly memorable scene, The Grinch acts as accuser, then proceeds to lay waste their town.<br />I can already hear someone saying to Me, \\"you think too much\\". To which I would answer, \\"no, you think too little\\". There are subtleties that can be picked up if one only wishes to see them. The \\"Evil\\" character in most any presentation, serves in his or her capacity as a catylist. Indeed, in most cases, \\"evil\\" serves as a catylist for change. In this respect, it serves as a positive & cleansing element that instructs in harsh lessons for the commoner.<br />However, since I Am acquainted with the original story, the outcome was predictable, although the pervasive question remained: \\"What does xmas have to with having a 'big heart'? Or the ability to show compassion towards those who deserve it?\\" Personally, I do not celebrate this xian holiday, but may participate in certain activities for the gift factor. The Winter Solstice is My Yuletide. It is all relative.<br />So, when The Grinch removes all of their precious little holy-day decorations, the whos begin to realize their erronious materialistic activities, & realize the root of their holiday. They consequently gather together in a large cluster, & celebrate the \\"true spirit\\" of xmas. \\"Evil\\" has once again purified the lies & deceptions.<br />Even through this quaint Seuss tale, the neccessity of catastrophe proves itself evident, as pain is indeed a harsh, though sometimes neccessary element. In its own way, this film speaks to the efficacy of The 9th Satanic Statement.<br />There is one female member amongst the whos who is just entranced by The Grinch, as she practically has orgasms as he displays his misanthropy. The \\"bad guy\\" lure. There's always at least one.<br />It would have been nice to preclude or follow this film with the original animation.

B00007BH5C|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this album, and I would have to say it is worth it's money.  By listening to the songs, it's almost as if you can hear all the hard work and thought that was put into making it.  Most of the songs are somewhat dark sounding, but it suited perfectly with the movie.  Just a warning, don't listen to it with the volume really loud because once I turned up the volume on this part that was suppost to be quiet and I found out it was too loud when this big blast of dark music scared the crap out of me =S
0783227434|4.0|\\"Klatu Barata Nikto\\" - the entirety of the plot depends upon those magic words {which ironically are not actually in Necronomicon}, to whether ot not \\"the dead shall arise to devour the living\\" - yet that last phrase is in Necronomicon. Just remember, when attempting to possess the book, utter those words exactly, lest you release the dead & invoke all manner of chaos.<br />Ash {Bruce Campbell} returns in this part three film of the Evil Dead series. But where the first two films focused primarily on insanity, which is entertaining or disturbing, depending upon who is viewing the presentation, part three lapses into much more of a comedic vein, likened very much the Hercules / Xena brand of humor, which may have actually derived from these films.<br />3 immediately resumes where 2 left off, transporting Ahe through the portal from the present into the past, circa mideival Ireland, complete with car, rifle, & the chainsaw which replaces the hand he amputated to be rid of the \\"evil\\" possessing it, which in itself made for quite a hilarious scene.<br />He is made a prisoner of war when he virtually \\"falls from the sky\\", & despite the recognition of the resident wiseman as the one prophesied as the deliverer / savior of their people, is instead identified as being a member of the opposing army's memvership, & is placed in chains & shackels along with a leader of the enemy, to meet their fate in \\"The Pit\\", an abyss containing several monsters who mutilate & kill whomever is thrown down into it - a veritable sacrificial pit. So poor Ash is forced to do his first battle with a couple of ghouls, until the wiseman, who resembles Merlin, toses in the chainsaw. Ash makes quick work ofthem, decapitating one, blasting another with his \\"boom stick\\", as he explained to the bloodthirsty peasants. And finally, he is acknowledged as the prophesied deliverer of the people.<br />He must acquire The Necronomicon from a cemetary, but is admonished to speak the afore-mentioned binding words of spell, but unfortunately, at the last moment, forgets the last word, eventuallcausing the dead, an army of darkness, to arise to do battle with mortals, but not before he must divulge the correct book from the three set upon an altar in the graveyard, experiencing the plights that each false one presents.<br />Subsequently, Ash has run-ins with impish clones of himself, a demon who flies off with a sweet damsel, who becomes possessed by the nefarious gloom besetting the land, but she is eventually released of the influence of the King of The Dead, who multiplied himself himself from the flesh of Ash during that scene with the miniature imp-clones which became reminiscient of Gulliver's Travels.<br />Ash teaches the mortal army a few new tricks, & prepares for the arrival of the excarnate nemesis in skeletal form. The remainder of the movie consists of Xena-esque battles until the book is preserved, victory is hailed, & Ash is returned to the present, where he rgails the apathetic S-Mart co-workers with tales of his explits. But again, he did not utter the words of Spell completely, & the results are made evident when a she-demon in the form of a hideous hag attacks his girlfriend {*There is another scene earler in the movie when another hag appeared to kill anyone who woild deem to possess the book*}, to which the warrior Ash surfaces once more, to battle another denizen of the dark.<br />Overall, Army of Dakness is a comedy, not really something that would give you a fright, but will tickle your funny \\"bone'. Personally, I prefer the first two over this version, for the more occultic references, focusing on the mythology of Necronomicon lore, & some of the more horriffic scenes.<br />The FX are remarkable however; well-hewn demonic creatures, the skeletal army is superbly done, & the environments are crafted quite appropriately, especially the cemetary.

0393307050|5.0|You can't read just one of these books, because you really want to absorb the whole series.  They are a fascinating look at the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812, accurate and detailed, using actual accounts and records as source material.  Post Captain Jack Aubrey and his surgeon Stephen Maturin are realistic men, not Rambo-type heroes who can keep slugging and hanging from cliffs while suffering dire injuries.  They have their human faults, but are wonderful companions in a wide variety of (mostly nautical) adventures.  Okay, sometimes there's more talking and introspection than action.  A lot more.  Did you ever read \\"Moby Dick\\"?  If you need to have the protagonist's life threatened every 10 pages, read some predictable male escapist fiction--there's plenty of that around.   <br />I don't have much patience with writers who keep cranking out the same book over and over, making money from the millions of readers who are slaves to an author's name on the cover.  Like Harlequin romances and that ilk, the stuff you see in airport bookstores.  O'Brian is different--his books are always new and interesting, and one story leads to the next in a very natural manner.  The series is a protracted adventure on the high seas, with a couple of likable companions and the rest of their crew.  The books are quick reads, easy to hold.  Or you can do as I do and get the audio version, narrated by Patrick Tull, who interprets his characters wonderfully.

0792844793|5.0|A fantastic, action-filled intense Noir thriller about a \\"joe citizen\\" named \\"Jeffrey Beaumont\\" {\\"well, howdie neighbor\\"} is pushed to the brink of insanity, as he stumbles across the nightcreatures inhabiting the underside of a Norman Rockwellian North Carolina suburb. The counter-culture; the flipside.<br />He comes upon a human ear decomposing in a field as he walks to & from from visiting his elderly relative in the hospital, who was seemingly attacked by his waterhose as he was watering the lawn one bright sunshiney day. The denizens lurking in the black earth are always prepared to take their due.<br />This film really manages to present the polarities between seemingly \\"wholesome\\" Americana & \\"unwholesome\\" Americana, as it were {the Dream & the Nightmare}.<br />Dennis Hopper portrays a most convincing sadistic crime boss addicted to nitrus oxide, who takes long, deep inhalations to magnify the thrill of the kill &/or sensual indulgence {often, one in the same}, which is always very graphic. He literally stuffs blue velvet in his victims' mouths as a calling card. Of his murders, the most notable was the execution of two Police officials - one with the material crammed in his mouth, & the other, standing dead with an electrical current running through the corpse. Now THAT'S creative! It rivals even Hannibal Lechter's imaginative killings.<br />Isabella Rosellini plays a tasty nightclub {'The Slow Bar'} dish whose prime number is, not surprisingly, \\"Blue Velvet\\" - which, after you learn more of the character's traumatic personal life, becomes much more haunting, as she is indeed a tortured soul.<br />She & \\"Jeffrey Beaumont\\" {MacLachlan} enjoy a tryst together, after she rapes him at knife-point, but he soon learns to compensate for his normalcy by indulging her fetish - sex & violence.<br />Interspersing the more dramatic/climactic moments in the movie {there are many}, are telling appearances of a dancing flame vigorously flickering upon a black candle accompanied by magnified infernal sounds {the black flame of life}, the protagonist growling beastially in dream sequences, a raging wall of lustful fire igniting the kundalini. Very Satanic. Thus is director David Lynch's style, as can be seen in favorites such as \\"Twin Peaks\\" & \\"Lost Highway\\" {which includes a cameo by Rev. Manson}.<br />Well, the villain discovers Jeffrey exiting from {Rossellini's} residence, after some particularly passionate sex, & takes them both for \\"a ride\\" {a Noir term meaning \\"swimming with the fishes\\", i.e., death}, but not before stepping by a favorite bar {what a sport!}. Of note, one of this author's favorite artists' song \\"In Dreams\\" by Roy Orbison is used as a prelude to the frivolity with Jeff. Jeffrey is subjected to mental as well as physical torture for a few hours, until beaten unconcious {not without good reason, of course}, & left in some desolate industrial section in the outskirts - he is truly fortunate to have not been executed.<br />Also keep in mind that he was deceiving a hometown girl {sort of an inconsequential foo (played by Laura Dern)}, but he could not fool the experienced fox, who makes them both pay for their lies.<br />{Dern}, a foo for sure, remains with him through the ordeal {that's true love!}. She represents the love interest / the \\"angel\\", whereas {Rossellini} represents the she-devil / succubus, or \\"lust interest\\", if you will. Between them both, is an amalgam of the \\"Madonna / Whore\\" dynamic analyzed by Freud.<br />Two worlds collide, & he walks the fine line between them, experiencing the pains & the pleasures of both.ccompanied by magnified infernal sounds {the black flame of life}, the protagonist growling beastially in dream sequences, a raging wall of lustful fire igniting the kundalini.

B00003CXXM|5.0|At first I was a little iffy on having Matt Damon as an action star. He has a good look, but I felt that he was too good an actor for this part, however, he pulls it off with ease. This is a well paced and smart thriller that does not insult the audience's intelligence by just feasting our eyes on explosions (go see XXX instead). Franka Potente as his love interest is also good in this film. Car chases usually cause me to curl into a fetal position from sheer boredom, but the obligatory one in this movie is very exciting to watch. It makes me want to go out and buy a Mini Cooper. This movie is a must own. My one complaint is that the very beautiful and talented Julie Stiles is wasted in this movie.
B000056QD7|5.0|This cd/vcd was released when stronger came out so it includes all the videos from Oops up untill stronger. It doesnt have DONT LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW, but u can get that from the UK BOX edition of OOPS.<BR>Well overall this cd is amazing which 3 bonus tracks not included in the US cd \\"Heart\\" \\"Girl In The Mirror\\" \\"You Got It All\\". Its amazing I especially like \\"Girl In The Mirror\\" and the vcd is the best because it also has karaoke versions of the videos. YOU CAN PLAY THE VCD on ur PC.<BR>This is truely the $$$<BR>Buy it now Britney fans!
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a very sweet movie and I would recommend it to anyone, even people with out kids. The animation is top notch, but what sets this movie a part is its soul. I can't remember the last time that a movie touched me in such a sweet way. John Goodman and Billy Crystal have excellent chemistry and are very entertaining.<br />Go watch this today!
B000000W6R|5.0|This is the first pumpkins album that really struck me.  THe cross breeding of folk, psychadelica, alt. rock, and metal makes a perfect combination for me.  The style is like no other and takes me off into a fantasy.  Jimmy Chamberlain becomes more amazing to me the more i listen and discover about him.  First off i think it is awesome that he was a Jazz drummer brought into rock and roll (elementary to most jazz musicians).   Because by doing that, he showed that you don't have to stay simple to avoid sounding ridiculous playing rock music.  He plays rudiments that most rock drummers don't use and makes them essential for the song.  The rim shots in the midst of his fills come to mind when i think of Chamberlin.  They are almost his signature deal. The songs wouldn't be the same without the rim shots.  Every drummer shows off with 32nd notes and they all sound the same.  But he makes 32nd note fills sound ten times better by accenting those rimshots in the right places.  A lot of the times Chamberlain would get down right funky with rudiments and who would have thought this very stylistic nature of playing would have gone perfectly in sync with the distorted, fantasy like, atmosphere that the rest of the band created?  <BR>Its Brilliant.
0380977788|1.0|I am a huge fan of Neil Gaiman, so it pains me to say this, but I found this book extremely boring and a tad too dark for young children. Coraline is not a very likable character. She doesn't have much going on that makes her interesting. Mr. Gaiman also doesn't do enough explore the other characters in the book, the two sisters, the man with the circus mice upstairs. I liked American Gods and Neverwhere much more. The characters were more interesting and there was more action.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This cd was a grand surprise. How can one so young sing with such torch? What sets Norah apart from the rest of her frosh class of artists is the originality of her material...it's fresh &amp; vintage at once.  It's one of those cd's that becomes a classic in the collection after the first listen. It's great to dig into the lyrics &amp; great to just play in the background. In short, this Norah Jones first effort is a shimmering joy.  FABULOUS.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I remember the first time I heard John Mayer. It was like something i had never heard before. I think it has be one of the most over played cds in my collection and it has recently provided me with a soundtrack to what is happening around me. I would say this is a must have album for anyone who likes to feel at home with themselves.
B000002AV5|5.0|It seems that half the people either know Sade and enjoy her work or have never heard of her. 'the best of sade' gives a good balance to her work with songs that reflect her style of music.  Whether with your loved one, or enjoying a great dinner, kicking back on the couch with your favourite beverage and you'll feel transported to nirvana.  Perhaps only performing once every seven or eight years doesn't help make her a household name ... if you get a chance to see her live don't miss out.  I've seen her perform three times - the last was row 2 with my girlfriend then (now my wife)  was worth every penny.  Thank you Sade!  Just remember 'every day is Sade'
B00006RU5B|5.0|This CD is AWSOME.  Chris Cornell's voice is so powerful it just sends you into a word of your own.  Uniting with Rage is the best that could happen.
B00005JKNF|5.0|One of the great films of all time. It's light and fun and full of rich detail and extraordinary performances.  Watch it over and over until you are enlightened(might take 724 viewings).  Only Topsy Turvy and The Last September are in this class for me as contemporary films go.  Altman went from \\"Nashville\\" in 1975 for Heaven's sake, to this masterpiece.  It seems all things are possible indeed.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Just a note to express my sorrow and my condolences to the family of James Dewar. He could carry a tune like noone else. In my opinon his finest work is found on &quot;Caravan to Midnight&quot;.<br />He passed away peacefully in England. Check out the website for more detail.
0676973779|4.0|I thought it was a wonderful story, well written. If it doesn't \\"make you believe in God\\" it will at least make you think about the divine in eveyday life. Well worth reading.
0399143904|5.0|i am 13, and though i may seem young to be reading these types of books, they are among my favorites. \\"Rainbow Six\\" is a book not for the weak of heart. it is full of graphhic violence, \\"He raised his MP-50 and fired the lethal automatic, and was satisfied to see a cloud of red mist appear where the mans' head had once been.\\" it is also full of some pretty perversive language (...). it is great on how well Tom Clancy discribes his environments and weapony. it gives the reader a sense of feeling that he or she is actually fighting along side the other combatants. i enjoyed this book a lot, and i think that if you are a fan of Clancy;s other reads, then you will enjoy this as well. my advice is: buy it.
B000002UB6|4.0|\\"Let it Be\\" was originally titled \\"Get Back\\" and was slated to be released prior to \\"Abbey Road.\\"  But those plans were eventually canned, and they instead pushed the record to a spring 1970 release and named it after their concert film.  This is quite possibly my least favorite Beatles album, but even a record as flawed as \\"Let it Be\\" has its incredible moments.  We all know the title track and \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" both of which deservedly shot to No. 1 on the charts.  But what makes this album worth a spin is Lennon's beautiful \\"Across the Universe\\" and George Harrison's \\"I Me Mine,\\" which, in my mind, are two underrated Beatles gems. The group went kaput the year this album came out, and while \\"Let it Be\\" sounds somewhat disjointed and unfinished (others even take aim at the production by Phil Spector), it's still has a couple of bright spots that remind us why they are the world's best pop group.
0553208845|5.0|For this review,I do not want to tell about the book,but just place a quote here-from the book-that summed up the whole book for myself.<br /> &quot;When someone is seeking,it happens quite easily that he only sees the thing that he is seeking;that he is unable to find anything,unable to absorb anything,because he is only thinking of the thing he is seeking because he has a goal,because he is obsessed with his goal. Seeking means:to have a goal; but finding means:to be free,to be receptive,to have no goal.&quot;<br /> That quote sums up for myself what we all strive for. Nirvana.
B0000541AM|5.0|I was in junior high school at the time of this movie release and didn't see it until it came on HBO a year or two later. At the age I was and the genre this movie oozed, this was some cool stuff. Being from a smaller town then New York City, I was in awe of this movie. I'm writing this review as I saw it and the way it made me feel at fifteen years old, although I just watched it again on a movie channel and it still brings back those feelings. The Warriors are blamed for something they didn't do and are on the run from every other gang in New York. To see what some of these gangs look like and what they are called is just mesmurizing to me. You really begin to hope they make their final destination to their turf. Fine acting, all around, and at least rent this movie if you don't buy it. I'm guessing after you rent it you'll want to buy it for your collection anayway.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I am a little skeptical when it comes to bying CD's.  I usually like to sample the CD at the local music store if possible before buying it.  This time However, I bought this CD from AMAZON.COM and they had little snipets from 5 songs.  I listedned and was somewhat intrigued.  Then I read some of the reviews that other people wrote.  I have to say this is one of my favorite picks of the last dozen CD's that I have purchased.  I usually listen to a different genre of music but was immediatly hooked when I heard the first release of \\"Don't know why\\" when it was played on the radio.  It took me about three times of listening to the CD in it's entirety to know which songs were my favorite.  \\"Turn me on\\" is very sensual and \\"One flight down\\" feels like an old favorite already.  I could go on for days about this more than talented young lady.  This is a must have for anyone, I don't care what kind of music you listen to.  This CD is very calming and mellow and makes me smile every time I listen to it.  There are at least two or three songs that I can relate to people in my life and it makes me think of them when I hear a certain song.

B00005JKZT|1.0|I have read the books, but that was years ago, so I don't remember much ... as such, I just want to deal with the movie by itself, without comparing it to the book.<br /><br />The first Lord of the Rings movie was long, but it was propelled by varied events, introductions of new lands and characters, diverse challenges, and so forth.  This movie merely retreads familiar ground, and has very little action.  I was willing to forgive the first movie for its corny dialogue (which I half expect in fantasy movies), but this movie piles on the schlock until I was either laughing or groaning out loud every 5 minutes.<br /><br />Much of the movie seems to be concerned with keeping everyone on track, so not much happens save for the characters walking around, riding horses, and talking.  Of the few action scenes, the exorcism that Gandalf performs on the king is ridiculous and has been done way too many times.<br /><br />The closing fight scene went on way too long as well.  I was expecting the fight to last about 10 minutes, but it seemed to go on for about 30, or close to it!<br /><br />Finally, Gollum was charming (he was by far my favorite character in the books, with Aragorn being second), but his inner-conflict shown in such a blatant external way again made his character laughable.  Another problem was Orlando Bloom, who I felt played one of the strongest and most likeable characters in the first movie:  in this one, though, they didn't seem to know what to do with him.<br /><br />Visually, this movie was miraculous and breathtaking, but its completely empty story, lack of emotion and depth, and seemingly forced, repetitive, and lengthy fight scenes, made it utterly torturous to watch.  I was literally squirming in my seat for the majority of this film.
B000070WJE|5.0|I just received my copy of Escapology yesterday and I haven't stopped playing it. It is an amazing CD. I own all five of his albums and this one is by far his best.  &quot;Escapology&quot; has a song to satisfy everyone's tastes. There are R&amp;B songs (&quot;Revolution), rock songs (&quot;Song 3 and &quot;Cursed&quot;), and even a song with a mariachi band (&quot;Me and My Monkey&quot;, which is one of the best songs on the album.) What is so incredible about this CD is that each song is completely different from the last. If you are a huge Robbie Williams fan like myself or you have never heard his music before, you must buy this CD.  It is better than most of the CDs out there today.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed.
0316666343|5.0|This book is wonderful!  It is a sad and difficult subject, but the way it was written was unique.  I have never heard anyone describe the &quot;life&quot; of the dead like this before.  Definitely worth reading!
B00001QEE6|5.0|Finally, a sweet innocent movie! Charming, loving, adorable, clever, incredibly cute animation, minimal violence and scary parts (just a couple of scary dogs and a dog catcher for excitement.)  And some stuff for you to laugh at, and enjoy along with the kids. A perfect movie for your 2-7 year old.  It's a dog love story. A couple of incredible cats make a cameo appearance. That's the best part of the movie as far as I'm concerned...but then... I'm a cat lover and my three year old is a dog lover.
B000002U82|5.0|This album has been a transcendent part of the musical development of many bands that came after it. 1973, 74 and 75 were excellent years for progressive rock, but I would say that this album in particular added a different perspective on how a conceptual album should be made. 43 minutes were enough to get someone in a completely different and original mood. The state of mind you get to be shows that the sound they delivered is absolutely hypnotic. Many different approaches and definitions have been given to the concept, all trying to explain a general, yet specific concept, the concept of life. An absolute masterpiece and considered by many as the ultimate concept album of all time, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; will make you think and analyze the various aspects and components that it includes.
B000002IU9|3.0|I'm not entirely sure I dig this album... one or two tracks were good,  particularly 'Master of the wind'. <BR>Metal warriors and Cherokee are good too, but having 2 new members in the band will ultimately change their sound, and some will probably argue its not REAL Manowar as it is now 1/2 a new group.<BR>The driving bass and screeching vocals are still intact, but the drums and Guitaring have certainly changed.<BR>Only a 1/4 of the guitar solos are actually solos! ....the rest are weird noises churned out by an uncreative (in a sense) axeman... no pun intended. It is also very hard to distinguish if they have either recruited the world's most accurate and precise drummer or just used a drum machine for the studio.<br />Other than that, its a much Darker album.... it dives a little too deep into the black pool than I care for. <BR>Manowar were always about gloom and doom, but the earlier albums had a more uplifting feel to it... (its hard to explain) it was just the chemistry between all 4 original members that gave them the 'feel' that is noticeably absent in this album, perhaps Manowar belong to the 80's more so than the 90's.
B00005JLRR|4.0|My wife and I thought ther movie was very entertaining. We can't understand why it has done so poorly at the box office.  Probably because people read too many reviews.  Most movies we have liked, the artsy fartsy critics did not. If we have any complaint, it has too much Data and not enough of the others.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Far too many people hear &quot;anime&quot; and automatically have some bad connotation.  They think it's too childish or too mature.  This movie is a great place to start, whether you want to see anime or are completely turned off by the genre.  Why?  First, it was produced domestically by Disney, and you know they aren't going to put out something too racey or ridiculous.  Second, the voices are people you know, like Gillian Anderson and Billy Bob Thornton (and someone who sounds a lot like James Earl Jones).<br />What else makes this so appealing?  Well, Billy Bob Thornton himself said that watching this, he forgot it was animated early into the movie.  The story is also compelling, with a rather Lord of the Rings-esque fantasy appeal.  The basic plot is that a boy must travel to find the Spirit of the Forest to have a curse removed from him.  On the way, he comes across a mining town, and the story moves into a &quot;harmony with nature&quot; kind of message.  Although it gets much more complicated, I'd prefer not to spoil too much of the movie.<br />Besides the story and familliar voices, the animation in the movie is excellent.  For those who have watched a fair amount of anime, it becomes obvious that there have been dramatic changes in quality over time.  This move is recent enough that it has a high quality animation.
B00007ELEL|5.0|If this isn't the funniest of all time, it's one of the top ten greatest flicks of the 20th century. Inexplicable genius. Eventually even the dumbest film critic in the world will come to face this fact. Some people think it's about modern man's loss of masculinity, and therefore his lack of a meaningful role. Others think it's about the generation gap. Read what you like into it, if you can keep your mind straight enough for long enough while rolling around on the floor in an agony of laughter. How can you explain a movie where thousands and thousands of fans know every line by heart? The answer must be down there somewhere, but the questions abide. How come the Dude is never seen to bowl? Why did it take so long for Bunny to get home between the time we saw her ten toes on the motorway and the time we saw her car crashed into the fountain, still playing Viva Las Vegas? Why does the reactionary Police Chief put his hat on before he punches the Dude? Is it Knutsson or Knudsen? What amuses Noss Harrington so much; and will Maud be showing her work at the Biennale? How heavyweight is Mr Sellars? What are the business papers of the unemployed? Did the fellows at forensic finally come up with a few leads? Who paid for the red car's damage? What is El Duderino's income tax bracket? The answers to these questions, though elusive, are not beyond all conjecture.
0066214122|4.0|It starts with the binding of the book, the texture that is unique among other hardcover bestsellers.  <br />Like Jurassic Park did with biotech, we get an introduction to where we are with nanotechnology right now and where we are going in the future.  Then we strap ourselves in for a fun &quot;what if&quot; ride.  <br />Like his other thrillers &quot;Sphere&quot; and &quot;Jurassic park&quot;, he does a masterful job with the set up.  Giving us haunting images of things I won't reveal for fear of giving anything away.  We are kept guessing and are entertained and fascinated along the way.  <br />Like Disclosure, Congo, Sphere, Timeline and others we get to see some pretty cool toys and technology.  Michael Crichton is the undisputed master of the Science techno thriller.  He doesn't quite hit a homerun here as he did in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; but this is a solid Triple into the gap!  <br />Recomended!!
B00007H1Y2|4.0|Often when Western musicians pair up with &quot;world music&quot; artists, the results sound like the Western person is almost completely submerged within the musical identity of the &quot;world&quot; person.  That happened with Henry Kaiser &amp; David Lindley's Norway &amp; Madagascar albums, and with various things Michael Brook has done.  Not here.  Ry Cooder's rootsy guitar is just as much a character in this music as Manuel Galaban and the different Cuban musicians he worked with on Mambo Sinuendo.  The tunes all have a Latin flavor, but filtered through various American mid-20th Century styles.  I was reminded of Esquivel as well as some of the Los Lobos side projects like the Latin Playboys and Los Super Seven.  The album is a real pleasure to listen to.  I probably would have enjoyed it even more if there were a few more cuts with vocals.  The female background vocals on the chorus of the title track are real cool.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Aside from its often discussed mystery, Mulholland Drive presents one of the most exciting, shocking, addictive 2 and a half hours of pure cinema of the 90's.  One might ask how a dream movie about a lesbian amnesiac can be this entertaining.  The answer is simple: David Lynch knows what he's doing. I usually get bored by directors who play tricks with their audiences, like David Lynch has been known to do.  But this flm shows his true storytelling skill as well as his excellent craft with actors.<br />The film works as a serious of related and unrelated vignettes.  The grand summation of these events surely confuses viewers, even provoking anger on those searching for semblances of traditionality or immediate logic, yet the vignettes themselves are so offbeat that a viewer-friendly ending would have disrupted any artistic cohesion.<br />Though this movie does have meaning as a cautionary tale about Hollywood and the dreams it shatters, its main purpose in the panorama of modern film is how far and innovative Lynch stretches the medium to tell a seemingly simple story: (about an innocent girl who goes to Hollywood).  <br />Naomi Watts (in a dual role) stars as the sunny idealistic Betty in the first two thirds of the movie and then as the cynical, embittered Diane in the last one third.  Naomi Watts gives a star-making performance.  She lights up every scene with a charming, old-fashioned perkiness as Betty and portrays Diane with alluringly dark emotional shadows.  As Rita/Camilla (her love interest) Laura Elena Harring is a perfect object of seduction.  Their scene of sex is a heartbreaking, poignant display of erotic love.  One friend believed it to be \\"exploitive\\" but considering that the entire relationship between the two lovers is the drive that fuels the dream/movie, I would say that the sexual passion of these two characters was absolutely necessary to display in a fleshed out sense (no pun intended).<br />Also in the mix of characters is the too-hip-for-words director, Adam Kesher (Justin Thereux) a director who, while looking to hire Betty, is seemingly caught up in a whole Hollywood scheme with bizarre midgets, Italian mobs, an adulterous Billy Ray Cyrus, and a very sinister cowboy.  <br />Something must be said for the music in this film by Angleo Badalamenti (who also plays one of the Italian mobsters).  The music is haunting, evocative, and sometimes comic, underlying the emotions of each scene brilliantly.  Cinematography is excellent, as to be expected from a Lynch movie.<br />Lynch has made bizarre independent (Eraserhead) Oscar winning linear stories (Straight Story, The Elephant Man) and critically panned (Wild At Heart).  With Mulholland Drive he returns to Blue Velvet's cross over avant garde appeal.  A masterpiece of art cinema.
B00005AQF7|5.0|this is not just one of the best rap cd's of all time, this is one of the best cd's of all time period in music in general. This cd is just str8 california g-funk, it doesnt get better than this, play this at a party and its sure to be off the hook!!!
B00006LFGD|4.0|A marvelous CD!<br />This CD include almost every duet that Babs has recorded. I only have one little comment about the new duet with Barry. (This was originally my dream duet!) I am also a big fan of Barry and I think he has such a good and powerful voice, which is comparable to Babs, but I just wonder why he sounds so soft in the new song &quot;I wont be the one to let go&quot;? It was too disappointing to me when I heard it the first time. He  just like a back up vocal for Babs, Did Babs use her &quot;power&quot; again to suggest to turn his recording volume down?????
B00005JLD4|5.0|Having lived in the Uk and Heard about the treatment of Aborigines in Australia I always felt deeply sad for another forgotton Race! Then I was lucky to move to Western Australia in 1991 and I relised that many people across the world have been prosecuted for who they are. As there is a possibilty of war against Iraq, woudn't it be nice if everyone forgot their colour, race, religion, or just their sad \\"hangups\\" And remembered that we all have a heart and we all breathe the same oxygen! Oh to have a peaceful world!!!!
1563898586|5.0|Terrific character work, fast-paced action, and an overwhelming sense of intelligence and love are what make this story about the 1890's premier adventure-hero team one of the best graphic novels around. Hand this to someone who says comics are just for kids. <BR>And let's hope the movie is half as good.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter has always been my favorite, ever since I read the first line of the first book. This movie lives up to the book, and even a little more. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) lives with the Dursleys, mean spirited people who hate having Harry around. After much plot development, Harry finaly gets his letter to Hogwarts. There he meets his two best friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). These little actors (and actress) are spectacular, Radcliffe and Grint are two very cute little boys, and Watson shines as the book smart Hermione. Ron and Hermione help Harry solve the mystery surrounding the ledgendary Sorcerer's Stone. I would give this movie ten stars, if I could, and I have both soundtracks, to the first and second films, and they are wonderful. The actors and actresses in this movie are to be aplauded. They took an already spectacular book, and made it into an extraordinary movie. Great job Daniel, Rupert, Emma, and everyone else who helped make this movie a croud pleaser. I know it sure pleased me!
B000002UB3|5.0|As the Beatles' last recorded album, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; tops off as my favorite album by anyone...ever. I think each Beatle has a shining moment on this album to themselves: John sings his heart out, while he does great lead guitar (George is usually lead), Paul shows off his vocal range and ability to play the piano with sweet ballads, bouncy sing-alongs, and pop-rockers, while George shows excellent songwriting with two of his most memorable songs, and Ringo does unforgettable drumming unlike he had ever before. From the chart-topping hits &quot;Come Together&quot; and &quot;Something&quot; to the beautiful rocking finish &quot;The End&quot; and the short but great &quot;Her Majesty,&quot; this album has some of the best music, vocals, and lyrics you could imagine. A must-have for any music lover!

B00002DEQQ|5.0|I can't understand why this hasn't been released in the United States, given it was such a big hit in Europe, but there you go. I'd heard &quot;Burning Down the House&quot; on an alternative radio station, and picked up this CD for the wonderful kitsch factor on that alone. Now it's become one of my favorite discs. I get the impression that all these younger artists were recruited with maybe a hint of irony, but ended up having too much fun in the process. Cover albums, for me, work best when the artist makes the songs his own, while retaining the original soul of the song being covered and in almost all cases, that's exactly what happens here. &quot;Burning Down the House&quot; is definitely the hook, but then he brings me back to my childhood with &quot;Mama Told Me&quot;, sounding like it could have been released the same year as Three Dog Night's. OK, there's a few duds (neither he nor the Pretenders can save the awful arrangement of &quot;Lust For Life&quot; -- Chrissie Hynde sounds like she's trying to upstage him, and he's just phoning it in) but you will forgive him once you've heard him wail out on Portishead's &quot;All Mine&quot; like it was the Bond movie theme it should be. That took moxie, (something Jones has plenty of) and whod've thunk anybody could improve on Portishead? Barenaked Ladies' kind of miss the point on &quot;Little Green Bag&quot;, (but later throw in the bass line as it should be done) but Jones covers that up with a spendid performance that almost makes me forget how the original went. And I think that Jones takes &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot; with the dance hall bombast contrast with lazyness that has British Musical Theatre written all over it, capturing the essense of the Kinks but signing his name to it. It's albums like this that define the difference between simply a singer and an intrepreter, and has convinced me that Jones is more than kitch. I am now a genuine fan.
B000003S0B|5.0|King Crimson loses points for creativity with this album because it is virtually identical to _In the Court of the Crimson King_, their debut. Nonetheless, I actually like this more than the debut because I think the songs are mostly better and the mellotrons aren't annoying. As a bonus, Greg Lake doesn't sing about witches and jesters either.<br />If you've heard the band's debut, you've heard this already. Well, sort of. Several songs from _In the Court of the Crimson King_ have an obvious cousin on _In the Wake of Poseidon_. For example, \\"Schizoid Man\\" is reincarnated as \\"Pictures of a City\\". Similar vocals, similar feel of frenzied jazz-rock -- I still swear Greg Lake is going to sing \\"Death seed, blind man's greed\\" when the vocals come back in after the slow part. And -- surprise! -- is breaks down into a cacophonous sludge at the end. Mirroring the first album again, \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" evokes \\"I Talk to the Wind\\". I like it better, though I'm not really sure why: very gentle, perfectly serene, and the call-and-response guitar-piano motif is gorgeous.<br />The title track parallels \\"Epitaph\\", but here the mellotron -- which simulates a backing string section -- sounds more organic and ethereal, whereas on the debut it was too thick and smothering. This is the best example of King Crimson as a symphonic prog band -- sublime, oceanic atmosphere supporting a fine performance from Lake. The lyrics are cool too: \\"Their children kneel in Jesus till they learn the price of nails   Whilst all around our mother earth waits balanced on the scales.\\" Beautifully flowing vocal harmonies over the roiling drum fills bring the song to its end with a feeling of uncertainty and fear. It kind of leaves me on edge.<br />\\"Cat's Food\\" is awesome, one of the most fun Crim tunes from before Adrian Belew joined them. Groovy rock, wacky laughter from Greg Lake, and chaotic crashes of piano have the song straddling the line between fun and annoying. My cat doesn't like this song, but I do.<br />\\"The Devil's Triangle\\" is the centerpiece of side two, an 11-minute symphonic venture based partly on Holst's awesome \\"Mars - the Bringer of War\\". It builds and builds, sickeningly ominous and pensive, finally exploding into an intense, chaotic sounding flurry at the end. As a point of interest, Symphony X's 20-minute epic \\"The Divine Wings of Tragedy\\" is also based loosely on that said Holst composition, and it's really quite good if you enjoy heavy metal.<br />Although the best was yet to come in King Crimson's music, _In the Wake..._ shouldn't be ignored. Trust me, I know these things.I do.<br />\\"The Devil's Triangle\\" is the centerpiece of side two, an 11-minute symphonic venture based partly on Holst's awesome \\"Mars - the Bringer of War\\".

B000066NW0|5.0|....  Apparently, you know nothing about good quality material.  Avril has an amazing instrument and is a wonderful songwriter as well.  It is so amazing to me that she is so young.  Her voice sounds as though she has had some voice lessons, or has sung in a choir and told about technique sometime in her life.  Also, I think her look and views are a great role model for girls her age and younger.  She is a real person and has not been sucked into the Hollywood mold most pop stars demonstrate these days.  Go Avril!
B000002BBY|3.0|all this talk of 'best band since the beatles'.....'no british band has ever made anything as good as this or ever will'<br />err what about 'the stone roses'?<br />c'mon people, see where it all really started!!!<br />this player is okay, obvious good points have been mentioned b4 'wonderwall' and 'champagne supernova', but theres really nothing exciting here.  just a  player thats loud and inoffensive.
B000069AUI|5.0|I bought this without even listening to it first,and I was not dissapointed. I would recommend this to anyone that has an appreciation for music.
B00006AG5N|5.0|To start with, yes, I feel there are Elvis hits that should've been in this collection and some that shouldn't have been included, but when you put together a collection of songs by a singer who came out with the number of top songs he did, there's no way everyone is going to agree 100% with the selection.  <br />For me, the most impressive aspect of this collection is the realization that Elvis Presley proved himself in so many genres of music.  At the start of the career, he was of course considered rock'n roll, many of his bordering on rockabilly.  However, he soon proved himself adept as a ballad singer with such hits as &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;.  A lot of his material fitted in the basic pop category, but spanning the years as he showed influence from The Ink Spots, Dean Martin and others.  In his way, he could croon to the teenagers of the era just as Sinatra and Crosby had to earlier fans.  <br />However, as this collection proves, he went beyond rock'n roll and pop with a country sound (influenced by Eddy Arnold, Hank Snow, etc.) often.  Then, he'd go and do just as well with R&amp;B.  From there, he proved himself as a capable gospel singer.  His Christmas albums were top sellers of the seasons they came out.  With Neopolitan type songs such as &quot;It's Now Or Never&quot; and &quot;Surrender&quot;, he came close to semi-classical with great renditions of melodies such as Mario Lanza sang.  <br />Not all of these reached #1 on any of the U.S. charts used; several were #1 on the UK charts, but did less well here.  That itself is interesting, noting the difference in reception of some of the songs in two different areas.  <br />So this collection is an excellant showcase of a major superstar's career and as such, is quite highly recommended.
B00004Z45A|5.0|Linkin Park are my fave. band ever! These songs are the most amazing pieces of art, that help you thru anything that's going on in your life. I've never owned a disc as wonderful as this, never have I loved ALL the songs, but this one is different. YOU need this one!!
B00005BL2A|1.0|I cannot believe this album is averaging more than 3 stars!! This is the absolute worst DM album EVER. It is dull and badly produced. The music and lyrics have no appeal even after repeated listenings in failed hopes of it growing on me. If it did not have the DM name on it, I can guarantee it would not have gotten airplay or noticed even by those of you who gave it a ridiculous 5 stars.  PLEASE people: do not rate bad albums with 4 or 5 stars just out of sympathy, or based on previous albums greatness... Rate the album on its own merits!! Other DM albums like Violator, Black Celebration deserve 4 and 5 stars. This one, I am sorry to say, is no comparison and deserves barely 1 star.
B000005DQR|4.0|this player is devastatingly good.  there are a few too many weak moments on this for it to be a momentous release.  but its certainly the best i heard in this genre.  napalm brain/scatter brain (or whatever its called) just moves me everytime i hear it.  organ donor is a right little belter too, (u can find a better version on preemptive strike).  and even though i find a fair bit of what i consider chaff on the album, i can see that there must be something for everyone on this disc.  his loose jazz stylings are proper suited to nice quiet moments and the rythym just drags you along, it takes you places i swear.  this 4 me is shadows best release, and as shadow is master of his genre, it makes this player a birthright in your collection.  its one of the best in mine.  the quality thats on display here would make it 5 stars for me if there werent so much weaker stuff.  one or two tracks i always expect to be a bit below par on any player, but this one just crosses that boundary. making me find the skip button too often enjoys a mans journey.
0066214122|4.0|Michael Crichton has frightened us for years with stories of plague and microbiological skulduggery or ineptness leading to horrifying environments.  In Prey, his newest, Crichton recombines the DNA of computer technology, nanotechnology, and biotechnology to produce a cutting edge thriller of high tech misfeasance and edge of disaster suspense.<br /> Jack is an unemployed programmer turned technology applications manager.  He is unemployed because he blew the whistle on shenanigans by his superiors in his Silicon Valley company.  While looking for a new job, he is a house-husband.  His wife, also a high-tech manager, is under extreme stress at her company, which is trying to find venture capital to bring out a really breakthrough product that will revolutionize diagnostic medicine.  The stress, or something, is causing a personality change that is almost as worrisome to Jack as his difficulties in finding a new job.  Is Julia really working all those long hours, or is she having an affair?  She certainly seems to be setting up a strong case for herself in a custody hearing if divorce is imminent.  The baby experiences a strange episode of sickness, then Julia is in an auto accident.  Then Jack's old company wants to hire him back as a consultant to solve problems that Julia's company is having with some software that Jack originally developed.<br /> While Julia is hospitalized Jack heads for the manufacturing facility in Nevada (that he didn't even knew existed) for a couple of days to solve the problems.  There he discovers problems far in excess of any he has been told about, and all of the crew are isolated and besieged by manmade horror.  Since the story is told as a flashback, readers know that all will come right in the end, or do they?<br /> Crichton has once again showed us the potentially horrible results from humans messing with the environment.  Of course, this is fiction and could never happen for real - could it?
B0000640VO|5.0|Those French, they sure know how to make a charming movie. Seeing this awhile ago in the theater in Minneapolis, I was skeptical at first on how the film would be. I have to say, though, that I was very impressed, not only by the great direction by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, but also by every single one of the actors and actresses. Everything in the movie is set up to be almost dream-like, from the small &quot;microcosm&quot; of the neighborhood that Amelie lives in, to the the strange and believable characters that live there. Tautou gives a remarkably charming performance in the lead role. She is at once an ingenue and a dreamer, and the film captures this perfectly. Mathieu Kassovitz, of La Haine and others, fame, is also great. <br />Having picked this DVD up while visiting in France, I was very impressed with the number of extras included, as well as eager to see how many of them would actually make it onto the US DVD release. Luckily, they all made it, a rarity for a foreign film. The transfer is great, but be a bit wary of the subtitles, they aren't all that accurate in their translation.

B00000J7JO|5.0|RHCP really find the perfect balance between, for lack of a better term, &quot;raunchy rockers&quot; and &quot;slow songs.&quot;  Their biggest hit up to this point was &quot;Under the Bridge,&quot; a slow song.  Fans really responded to how evocative and emotional it was.  And the band was very up to being very musical and lyrical.<br />So in CALIFORNICATION, the biggest hits are again the &quot;slow&quot; songs, such as &quot;Scar Tissue,&quot; &quot;Otherside,&quot; and the title tune.  These are all great songs, with lyrics that don't really make sense, but nonetheless conjur interesting images and evoke a mood.  Anthony Kiedis's singing is the strongest and most emotional its been up to this point (although that improves on their next album, BY THE WAY).<br />Yet the album also rocks.  &quot;All Around the World&quot; got the most radio play, and it really gets the album off to a strong, rocking start.  It shows the band at its jammin', noise-making best, and features plenty of &quot;raunchy&quot; material.  Later, we can enjoy such &quot;raunchy&quot; tunes as &quot;Get on Top,&quot; &quot;I Like Dirt&quot; (a personal favorite) and &quot;Purple Glove.&quot;  There are other great songs in both genre's, and the final feeling one is left with is of spending a great hour with one of the great rock bands out there, capable of handling any style and making it their own.<br />All the musicianship is outstanding.  These guys just get better and better as purveyors of their instruments.  Each album shows positive evolution, which is great, and oh so rare.  The standout, as always, is Flea.  His bass-playing is simply incredible.  He puts almost everyone out there to utter and complete shame.<br />If you can only own one RHCP album...this is THE ONE!!
B000069AUI|5.0|Indeed this would be the advice I give to any listener of colplay. Relax, let go of all preconceived notions and cynicism about how hard edged or message laden music should be. Because make no mistake, this is an album of great beauty, depth and soul. Something real and honest in a vast desert of manufactured mediocrity.<br />I'll say no more, rather let this exquisite album speak for itself
B00005UEAR|4.0|Dream Theater is kind of a controversial band with me. I own nearly all their material, but I have problems with some of the pretentiousness and sappiness inherent in much of their music (especially with James Labrie). However this release really has made me have a turn around on the band. I've always liked Dream Theater, but with the obvious thoughts listed above, they never were one of my favorite bands or anything. This album, does much to raise their rating in my eyes. I like the newfound heaviness on tracks such as \\"The Glass Prison\\" and also like their new experimental side with debts to Radiohead, Porcupine Tree and Tool with such tracks as the Great Debate. I love the variety on this album. And the Title Track just seems catchier to me than Metropolis Part Two (also a recommended album). James Labrie has a more ballsy voice this time around, much to the benefit of the music. It just sounds like they are much more relaxed and loose on this recording, which defies the stereotype of anally retentive prog musicians. This improves the music, definitely. Its my favorite Dream Theater album since Images and Words by far.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is a great album my favorits songs is Cant hold us down great song,and Fighter,Beautiful,Make Over And The Dirrty ok bye (Icelandic word is Bless) =)
B000002IGP|1.0|This is about as bad as it gets, folks. 10 pointless tracks, boring guitar solos that seem to find their way into every songs, a band name that tries to give you the idea that the band is tough (why not just name the band Rat), and Tawny Kitaen on the cover to boot. If you dont get out much, you might find this album great. However, if you are a fan of the 80s and want to ditch the whole mullett scene, I suggest something along the lines of Depeche Mode, New Order or Tears For Fears, among other synth, new wave bands i wont mention. It'll show you that guitar heroes arent what make music good. I think that was established when Nirvana came around. New Wave music has seemed to have endured all these years and still get played regularly on radio and on the dance floor. The only song on this album that I am familiar with is &quot;Round and Round&quot;, and it honestly has no point to it. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this album, or any other glam metal, hair metal, or hard rokk album.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|When my friend first recommended this duo I was, like all others, skeptical. I had thought it was another rock band that i negletted the offer. when i finally set aside my usual obssession of latin pop to hear to preview this song, i was wowed. then i went straight to a store and got the cd. it is superb. everyone i know is talking about it, and nobody seems bothered by their lesbian status (or so they proclaims).<BR>Speaking of vocal talent, if you are looking for some seriously deep cords, then Tatu isn't one for you. Surprisingly, their high-pitched wailings, especially in their hit song &quot;All the THings she Said&quot;, aren't irking to the ear. They have some excellent danceable techno songs, in addition to the good but overplayed &quot;All the Things&quot;, such as Show Me Love, Clowns, and How Soon is Now. I love the eerie, slow 30 Minutes as well - the piano opening is captivating and haunting: in this case, Tatu's girlish and rather high voices give the song a haunting feel and mysterious echo (almost to the effect of the Vienna Choir Boys). I also enjoyed the Russian tracks of &quot;All the Things&quot; and &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; - they feel like their own original songs as opposed to just the same songs in another language.<br />Tatu's CD is probably the oddball amongst my (almost entirely) classical and instrumental/New Age music, but I don't like it any less. Even if you aren't a fan of mainstream, electro-pop, please give Tatu an ear.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina is absolutely brilliant. I don't care what people say of her, but her music is rare and few, but when she really makes an album, she really gives back to the -real- fans. She's more a hardcore princess who OWNS them all.<br />Britney can't touch this.
0060537639|4.0|I found the book an interesting theory and I would be most interested to read some reasons why the theory is not at least, in part, possible. I noted the other comments did not mention the theory that the Portugese reached Puerto Rico some 60 years before Columbus. How many other historical events or \\"truths\\" have we found to be incorrect. As a book I enjoyed it as much as Kon Tiki and Aku Aku which had much of the same speculative sense of fun about them. And yes, the chinese discoved Kansas City, that one I found a little hard to believe. But I think you will enjoy this expecially if you like maps, history, and a mental time twister.
0316666343|4.0|I loved the idea of this book, Sebold's story of a family from the perpsective of the dead teenage daughter, stuck in what seems like limbo.  The slightly macabre subject of the girl's murder is dealt with in a strangely matter of fact way, no disturbingly realistic descriptions one might find in a Patricia Cornwall novel, nor any sentimental brushing over of the details.  This novel is dreamy, yet realistic, so realistic that i found myself wondering how accurate Sebold's take on heaven may be.  <BR>This book allows us to see the lifelong consequences of tragedy and makes you look ponder heaven and earth, life and death and mortality.  <BR>It started out promisingly  but by the end I found it all a bit much to take and I started to get a little frustrated witrh the author's evasiveness about the murder.  I think the novel really lost it when the whole swapping fiasco took place, everything up till then was believable.<BR>Still, a very interesting read, very different to whats out there at the moment
B0000636UN|3.0|Remember that sweetly forlorn, wide-smiling crooner who wailed the walls off of the Tuesday Night Music Club, that unusual pop album of range, depth, honesty, soul and, best of all, maturity? Sheryl Crow's feats of nine years ago now seem like the distant haze of last night's dreams. The raw and instantly gripping &quot;Strong Enough,&quot; the almost Floydian &quot;Run, Baby, Run,&quot; or the more musically ambitious &quot;Can't Cry Anymore&quot; and the smoky, jazz-laden &quot;We Do What We Can.&quot; Just to learn that the album replaced a previous record of slick production was enough to believe in pop music, even if only for the 50 minutes served up by Crow's lauded debut.<br />Even back in 1993, such gorgeous and atmospheric expressions of yearning as &quot;I Shall Believe&quot; sounded too good to be true, as many skeptics suggested that Crow's wardrobe and clever cohorts such as Jeff Trott and producer Bill Bottrell had more of a hand in Tuesday Night Music Club's success than the singer's own talents. Today, such performances as &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; are downright anachronistic; flakes of an era in which even rock stars still played for the sake of the song. No wonder critics trace much of Crow's material, including that from her latest, C'mon, C'mon, back to the 1970's folk/rock onslaught.<br />When Crow unleashed 1996's monstrous, self-titled follow-up, it seemed that she had salvaged her name from the clutches of nay-sayers for good. The album's diverse exploration of Crow's roots blew the hinges off of just about anything else released that year, from the brooding folk of &quot;Redemption Day&quot; to the clanging classic &quot;Maybe Angels&quot; to such nods to The Rolling Stones as &quot;If It Makes You Happy.&quot; Maybe the blood red lipstick and velvet music videos were a bit too lush for those who fell in love with Tuesday Night's reassuring modesty, but the power of the songs made it easy to overlook such extravagance.<br />Despite its fusillade of delicious hooks and grooves, 1998's Globe Sessions struck many as a tired rehashing of old heartbreaks and guitar licks. Crow had written variations of &quot;The Difficult Kind&quot; about ten times before Globe Sessions, and songs like &quot;There Goes The Neighborhood,&quot; &quot;My Favorite Mistake&quot; and &quot;Anything But Down&quot; relied too heavily on past triumphs. In short, Sheryl Crow sounded tired of herself, and what was 1996's reinvention had quickly become stale two years later.<br />But if Globe Sessions was stale, C'mon, C'mon is about as edible as a stone. The album is just as burdened by the presence of old cohorts as it is by the unfortunate crew of Crow's new friends, from Don Henley to Gwyneth Paltrow. Yeah, that Gwyneth, who contributes a &quot;guest vocal&quot; to &quot;It's Only Love,&quot; just one of the album's many cluttered productions. Whereas Globe Sessions benefited from the inclusion of a couple of raw, underproduced tracks such as the exquisite &quot;Riverwide&quot; or the Bob Dylan-penned &quot;Mississippi,&quot; only C'mon, C'mon's &quot;Weather Channel&quot; suggests any awareness of the magic that built Tuesday Night Music Club.<br />Whether she is suffering from a sudden struggle with self-consciousness or just can't find a reason to care anymore, it is certain that someone needs to escort Crow back to the drawing board, and fast.<br />This time around, Crow repeatedly ruins songs that begin honestly but quickly descend into noisy, overproduced nonsense. Just as the lonely tapping of Crow's piano at the onset of &quot;It's So Easy&quot; offers a suggestion of poignancy, Crow and Don Henley almost fearfully retreat from the possibility of making a compelling tune. A disharmonious maelstrom of electric guitars, Wurlitzers, organs, drums and Henley's jarring squeal make a complete mess of the song. Other tracks, such as &quot;Steve McQueen,&quot; &quot;You're An Original&quot; and the title track are as bombasticas a Moody Blues outtake.<br />The real tragedy here is that while the music suffers from an apparently desperate attempt at pop-appeal, Crow's songwriting has rarely been this poignant. This tension between authenticity and shamelessness characterizes the entire album. The trademark wit showcased on Sheryl Crow shines here on songs such as &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot;: &quot;it's not having what you want/it's wanting what you've got,&quot; she opines on the album's most overt single.<br />While unimaginative lines such as &quot;C'mon, c'mon, c'mon/Break my heart again&quot; are boring and hollow resorts to exhausted devices, the album's wealth of laments and resignations offers some of Crow's most stirring songwriting. &quot;I got friends/They're waiting for me to comb out my hair/Come outside and join the human race/But I don't feel so human,&quot; she sings along with Emmylou Harris on &quot;The Weather Channel,&quot; the album's most honest and thoughtful composition. Crow's writing demonstrates that there is enough experience and pain beneath the surface of her sunny pop songs for a lifetime's worth of pathos. Instead, she condescends to fans by resting on her laurels. C'mon, C'mon is the work of a talented artist whose interest in maintaining any sense of authenticity is fading fast.s a Moody Blues outtake.<br />The real tragedy here is that while the music suffers from an apparently desperate attempt at pop-appeal, Crow's songwriting has rarely been this poignant.

6304498969|4.0|I got this DVD for educational purposes. Even though I really love EC's unplugged album, it's so much better watching him perform. <br />Where can I find a tabs for the unplugged album exactly as he plays on this DVD? The tabs I have supposedly is the accurate transcription...the Hal Leonard one (not the easy one). But it's different from the way he plays on the DVD. I play the DVD in slow motion and try to see how he does it. It's great. <br />They do show a lot of close up shots of him playing, but I wish there were more. And I want to hear him playing solo more :) Not a duet and not with piano accompaniments etc..<br />The quality isn't that great, akin to that of a video tape. Minus 1 star for the quality.
B00000099Y|5.0|I can't believe that someone gave Tool just 1 star. It's just not right, it's like saying Hendrix is a bad guitarist or Axl has no voice or somethin. This guy Alvaro Fernandez gave Tool's Aenima just 1 star. My suggestion is: DON'T listen to that man. Mr. Fernandez may be right, Adam Jones (guitar) may not have the skill to compete with other great guitarist, but in his own style he is a genious; in fact, one of my guitar heroes. Then mixing it with Maynard's voice, Justin's Bass, Carrey's incredible drumming, it's a masterpiece. Tool's Aenima deserves 5 stars.
0066214122|4.0|It's the story of nanotechnology gone awry. Crichton does a great job of walking you through the technical stuff that makes up the nanotechnology monster and creates some fantastic characters. The protagonist is a stay at home Dad who must battle runaway technology, a bizarre wife, an evil boss, and a nosy sister, all while taking care of three kids - including the double trouble of a teenage girl and a 9 month old infant. I wasn't  impressed with his last two novels, but this book represents  a return to form.  I read this in two nights. If you like techno thrillers, this is a great one.
B00006LLNU|4.0|Wow. These guys took me by total suprise. Their music somehow perfectly represents their Icelandic origins. This is one of the best albums I have that I like to listen to while relaxing and thinking. Very beautiful songs here, The singers voice really have an etheral quality to them. I really think that these songs could have been the perfect soundtrack to the Fellowship of the Rings. These guys somehow manage to make really really unearthly (or too earthy) sounds out of guitars, bass, piano, and drums. Really good stuff. I reccommend this to anyone who is into lighter mood music, or if you are just into songs with unbelievable beautiful melody and production value. I'll admit, this won't be for everyone. Check it out first before you buy. If there was any drawback I could pick out, it would be that many might get bored with it, but just know that it is better suited for background music till you really get into it. But even then, it is a pleasure to have it in the background.
B000060P79|5.0|Being a new fan of rock, punk rock, and the genre itself, i'm very picky about what bands i listen too. More so for the sound the band gives off, and the way it gives off that sound. What got me liking rock were bands like new found glory, third eye blind, and matchbox 20. But listening to those bands, it wasn't until their 3rd or 4th album is when i heard their sound evolve, and turn into something actually worth listening too. SIMPLE PLAN DOES THAT.....AND ITS THEIR FIRST CD!!!! These guys are REALLY good, and i can say that based solely on the fact that this is their debut album, and ALL THE SONGS ON THE CD ARE GOOD!!!...ALL OF THEM ARE CATCHY. I know how its like, you buy a cd, and once you put it in, you wanna hear all the tracks, or the beginning of them for that matter, to see which get your attention and keep it. ALL THE SONGS ARE THE ALBUM DO THAT!!! TRUST!! GO GET THIS ALUBM, AND GIVE THE RECOGNITION THESE GUYZ DESERVE!
B000002JS0|4.0|This album is the best as far as variety of style for early AC/DC.  The only thing missing, which I hope they include on the remastered edition, is the inclusion of the song: &quot;Love Song.&quot;  This would be the ultimate addition to the wide spectrum of musical menu offered here...One can only hope!
B000020617|5.0|This album was destined for greatness the first day it came out in the winter of 1999. I'll let it be known right off the bat, so as to avoid any further doubts. This is my favorite Foo Fighters album to date, even with the new and excellent &quot;One by One&quot; out.<br />To start off, this album isn't normal Foo Fighters, it was something different, which held the essense of the Foo Fighters. You will only find a few hard rockers to satisfy your teenage angst upon. But with that said, this album still feels heavy, but it's heavy with melody and guitar effects. The guitars are crunchier and less produced sounding than their previous records. The bass lines are more complex, and catchier. These songs were made to make you feel like a little kid again when you first started listening to music and heard those opening chords to the song that filled your ears with wonder, whatever song that was. The lyrics are also as strong as I have heard from Grohl, with lots of plays on words and off key comparisons to real-life experiences. I don't think this record is as poppy as people lead one to believe. It has a rough edge on the whole recording that makes you remember you are listening to the Foo Fighters. It should be entitled a great rock album and nothing more.<br />This record really is best to listen to as a whole, but I think the highlights could be listed for sake of reviewing. &quot;Stacked Actors&quot; the first track, starts off with probably the hardest riff from Foo Fighters ever, it just as quickly decides to leave you hanging in midair going what happened with it's cocktail lounge verse, only to kick start the distortion again and zoom back into battle field of hard rock. Two big players in this album are the back to back &quot;Generator&quot; and &quot;Aurora&quot; who simply have some of the most beautiful melodies I've heard in rock music. Starting with &quot;Aurora&quot; the second half of the record decides to take a breather, and you get to swim peacefully through more laidback, or lighter songs as &quot;next year&quot; or &quot;ain't it the life&quot; only to end with &quot;M.I.A&quot; which is the perfect closer with the vocals screaming &quot;You won't find me, I'm going MIA, ....getting lost in you again is better than better than being numb...&quot;. Then the record ends, and you find yourself starting the disc over again, and again, and again.<br />This is a disc that you have to get used to if you've been a fan of the Foo Fighters from the beginning. It's different, yes. It's very different. But the best stuff comes from artists who decide to take that chance, and decide to try something new, and go through with it. &quot;There is Nothing Left to Lose&quot; is a testament of that for the Foo Fighters, and I think it deserves appraisal, not shunning. I think this is one of the best rock records of the 90's, no joust.ly through more laidback, or lighter songs as &quot;next year&quot; or &quot;ain't it the life&quot; only to end with &quot;M.I.A&quot; which is the perfect closer with the vocals screaming &quot;You won't find me, I'm going MIA, ....getting lost in you again is better than better than being numb...&quot;.

B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer was the first album I ever bought from Radiohead.  I bought it after reading the many reviews on this website.  It really is a great album!!  Such a different sound and style that sets this album apart from all others.  I bought Radiohead's previous album The Bends soon after but did not like it as much.  Its a good album but does not match even close to OK Computer.  Do youself a favor and buy this album you won't regret it.
B000000XB9|5.0|If you want to get the best and the bulk of CCR, make no other choice! You definetly, DEFINETLY need this album. There's no question in my mind that any '60s music fan should do without it! From their cover of the 1957 Dale Hawkins' tune \\"Susie Q\\", which by the way CCR's renidition is the best especially with the infectious drumbeats at the beginning, to \\"Someday Never Comes' which was one of their last gold singles. Every song is essential and a top-grade classic! Turn the volume up on \\"Up Around the Bend\\" to show everyone that Classic Rock is the best! This album has been certified a multi-platinum status. I don't know what the sales are, but if this album keeps selling strong here on Amazon.com, it will be, in my opinion, one of the greatest rock'n'roll albums ever! Their 11 minute renidition of \\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\\" is the best next to Marvin Gaye's and Gladys Knight and the Pips' versions. It is a feast for the ears from a band that drove the musical audience back to good ol' American rock'n'roll! 'Tis a shame they never had a #1 hit, but they've come pretty close many times!
B00006AW2F|3.0|There are two crucial flaws with this album that every Stones fan should know about.  First and foremost, many of the songs feature LAME \\"country guitar\\" overdubs which were done in 1975 by an unnamed session guitarist.  Fans would be much better served if ABKCO would just released the original, un-doctored versions of these songs (which are available on certain less-than-official CDs).<br />Second, why bother releasing SOME of the 1963-65 demos, but not the rest of them?  If fans liked the early version of \\"Heart Of Stone\\", then surely they'd enjoy the unreleased early take of \\"Blue Turns To Grey\\".  And what about \\"So Much In Love,\\" \\"You Must Be The One\\" or \\"Sure I Do\\" (a rare Brian Jones composition)?<br />Instead of this hodge-podge of leftovers from various sessions and eras, ABKCO should have released ALL the available 1963-65 demos (30+ tracks) on a single CD.
B000066C1N|5.0|This soundtrack is INCREDIBLE! Not only does it compliment the movie when you watch it, but it completely holds it own. Bryan Adams is fabulous. My entire family (ages 4&amp;up) listens to this cd everytime we get into the car. We even have one for inside so that we don't have to run out to the car to get it. It is a must have for anyone who enjoys great music with meaning!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|&quot;TATU&quot; is the name of the russian duo which is shocking the world, with its controversial songs and attitudes. The debut english album, &quot;200km/h in the wrong lane&quot;, is a cool CD and I've been listening it a lot. &quot;All the things she said&quot; is reaching the charts everywhere in the world and is a great song, despite the lesbian content. I also like the song &quot;Stars&quot;, specially because of the indian arrangements and the russian lyrics I can't understand. The cover version of &quot;How soon is now?&quot;, very criticized, is really enjoyable and it's worth checking. &quot;#0 minutes&quot;, &quot;Not gonna get us&quot; are great dance tracks and will please almost all TATU listeners.<br />&quot;200km/h...&quot; is a pop album above the average. Julia and Lena, the singers, do not reveal the audience if they are really lesbians or if it is all a marketing strategy. Anyway, the album is great and I'm glad it was released overseas.
0767811070|5.0|Of all the \\"hood movies\\" This is hands down the best. Many movies try to reflect the daily dramas that are played out in the urban war zones and ghettos of the \\"Land of the Free\\". \\"South Central\\", \\"Menace to Society\\", and several others come to mind. But none of these others can compare to \\"Boyz N  The Hood\\".<br />First off, you have a great, and talented cast. Fishbourn is terrific in his portrayel of a hard edged father who tries to raise his son right and teaches him to be a man in a harsh world. Cuba Gooding JR is incredible in his performance (despite a few moments of obsurdity) as Tre, the main character, who is the only kid in the hood to have a positive male role model. Ice cube does very good job as \\"Dough Boy\\" the bad *** of Tre's friends. <br />The story is also very good and is told well. We begin with Tre as a violent and disturbed young child living with his mother, who is then kicked out of his school for beating up other kids. His mother sends him to live with his father. We then see Tre and his friends grow up and dealing with the problems of young adult minorities in an urban environment. <br />There are a lot of emotional parts to this movie and it aproaches the subject manner in a pretty mature fashion meant to impress the desparity of the Ghetto as well as what it's like to try and grow up and survive there.<br /> Just like similar movies there is a significant amount of graphic violence, but I look at it as a more realistic depiction of the stories setting and characters. The difference with Boyz N The Hood is that it uses violence in a more responsible way, and there is less of it compared to say \\"menace 2 society\\". The violence in the movie isn't just thrown in for fun or to show you some violence, but to impact you. <br />Also there is a definate message of consequences of actions and the movie stresses the importence of making good choices, and doing the best you can even if the hand you are dealt isn't the best. In The end Tre prevails andis a good man, despite all the odds stacked against him. <br />This movie really brought tears to my eyes and it was a fabulous, and disturbing look at the problems that America seems to pretend don't exist. Watch this movie and it may even change the way you look at the world.
B00005JL78|4.0|I've seen some really cool special features on some Sc-fi DVDs, the documentaries on 'Star Wars: Episode II' are a good example. But the technical work-ups for 'Minority Report' are less than satisfactory. The movie, in case you don't know, is centered around a Pre-crime Officer, played by Cruise, who is targeted for arrest for the future murder of a man he doesn't know. The insuing chase shows off some really cool technology, including a sonic-pulse gun that cocks by spinning it around, and a baton that makes you throw up. However the special features barely even mention how they were concieved. The mystery of the film is an entrancing roller-coaster with Sherlock Holmes calibur detectives (this was we can thank classic sci-fi writer Phillip K. Dick for) and stunning visual scapes that range from a peaceful country house by the ocean, to a huge magnetic super-highway system. But, once again, the special features don't tell us anything interesting about them, just a brief run-down of where the ideas came from. It's really disapointing that you get a great movie, with multi-layered mysteries intertwining to create a finale that is both exciting and philosophical, and then get special features so shallow in their content that it hardly seems worth the effort to burn the disc. I highly reccomend this film, and the price for the second disc is well worth it for a movie this good.
0790731452|4.0|First thing you'll notice about this movie is an all star cast. I've seen few movies with as many noticable names. Jack nicholson, Michael J Fox, Tim Burton, Tom Jones, Danny Divito... it goes on and on. <br />I've seen such mixed reviews of this movie, and it really depends on who your are and what your taste is. If you don't like corny, cheesy humor then you wont like this movie one bit. It helps if you are familiar with the old 50's sci-fi movies and such, which this movie spoofs. Also this movie is based on an old collectible card series called Mars Attacks, so if you're familiar with that you will likely enjoy it more.<br />Mars Attacks has many moments that are rediculously silly, and that's the whole point. That's what the movie is all about. The acting which is pretty cheesy at times is purposely portrayed that way for comedic effect. So my concern is that people judging this film are not taking into acount the type of movie they are rating. I think many who said this was the worst movie ever just don't like this type of movie, so thier dislike could have been predicted from the start. <br />In short while this is by no means a master piece of the cinema, it is a fun movie that gives you plenty of laughs, some entertaining special effects, and a lot of spoofing. This movie perfectly fits it's niche.
B000023VR6|5.0|I used to think that east coast rap was better than the west coast but this album changed everything. When you buy this album you ll get your every penny back. maximum satisfaction of rap.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Now, I should first state that I am by no means a \\"pop\\" music fan, I never have been but I really find it hard to categorize this album as straight \\"pop.\\" It has pop elements to it but the major feel I get from this poem is rock and soul and R&B. Initially upon seeing the video for \\"Dirrty\\" I was disgusted as I'm sure many of you were. The song was catchy of course and after awhile I found myself enjoying it but the video is atrocious and I hope Christina's learned from this mistake. Obviously she was trying to make a statement but she went too far, for my eyes anyway. Trying to ignore my initial disgust I downloaded some of her songs and I was stunned! I was tremendously surprised, I like everyone else, knew that Christina's vocal range was fantastic but this was something else, not only could she sing like no one I had ever heard before, but this time around she was actually singing about something worth singing about. Real life. Not pop ... about boys and crushes, songs about life and all the trials and tribulations that she has had to endure. This CD has given me a new respect for Christina Aguilera that I would have never had before I listened to these songs. \\"Fighter\\" is an anthem for me right now, it's all about perseverance and not giving up and it's uplifting without being trite. \\"Beautiful\\" is an excellent song about embracing the differences in all of us and seeing our true beauty and this video was just beautifully done. I really couldn't find one song on the album that I didn't enjoy, maybe \\"Dirrty\\" but it's just fun to get down to although there is no real message to it other than gettin' dirty. My musical tastes have always been varied but I never in all my life imagined I would be writing a review for a Christina Aguilera album but here I am, and I loved it. Her songs are just plain REAL. She can sing, she can write, she can get dirty, and she can make even a punk fan like me take a second listen to this album and you should too. It truly is beautiful.
B00005R2M3|4.0|This cd is sooo cool! i love it! i especially love the Arabic background in Eyes like Yours, and i love the sweetness of Que me Quedes tu. I totally love this cd and i recommend it to everyone~!
0784011176|4.0|This is a hauntingly somber movie, and that's precisely why I enjoyed it so much.  This movie contained the entire package that, when delivered, evokes a reaction that is sure to stay with the viewer long after the end credits are shown.<br />In the style of the classic novel \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, this movie is the story of a single mother named Ada (Holly Hunter) who comes to New Zealand with her daughter, Flora (Anna Paquin), in order to meet a local farmer named Stewart (Sam Neill) who has arranged to marry her.  They come with their belongings, none more sentimentally valuable than Ada's piano.  However, reasoning that it is Ada's duty to make sacrifices in the interest of the family, Stewart trades the piano to a neighbor named Baines (Harvey Keitel) for the rights to some farming land.  Little does Stewart realize that Baines knows exactly how precious this piano is to Ada, and he makes this trade in an attempt to make a play on her affections.  Stewart arranges for Ada to go over to Baines' house and teach him to play the very piano that belonged to her.  Ada and Baines work out an arrangement where in lieu of teaching Baines how to play the paino, she will instead play the piano for him and allow him to use her in order to fulfill his carnal fantasies.  In exchange, Baines will eventually give the piano back to Ada.  As time goes by, Ada goes as far as sleeping with Baines in order to work off the debt she owes him for her piano, but after a while, Ada's trysts with Baines are no longer for the sake of earning her piano back, but are voluntary.  She develops feelings for Baines, much to the chagrin of her husband, who locks Ada and Flora up in their house in order to prevent them from going to Baines' house.<br />There were some brilliant performances in this movie.  Though Anna Paquin's character only plays a small part in moving the story along, her screen presence is extraordinary.  She was one of the youngest actors to ever win theAcademy Award, and her Oscar was much deserved.  Holly Hunter also won an Oscar for this movie, and it, too, was well deserved, especially considering the fact that she didn't utter a single word for the entire movie.  The strength of her performance relied solely on her acting ability, and could not be assisted with the influence that there voice might have carried.  Of the males in this movie, Harvey Keitel does a sold job as a rather homely farmer, but the real credit must go to Sam Neill as Ada's husband.  The tantrums that he throws are very realistic and incredibly compelling.<br />Also worthy of mention is the movie's incredible art direction and cinematography.  The entire movie takes place in a gloomy beachfront and forest.  The lack of sunshine and sheer dismalness complements the haunting performances and plot.<br />I would have given the movie a 5 star rating, but I wasn't satisfied with the ending.  Though I won't tell you which of the two men Ada ends up choosing, it's my opinion that both men were scummy, and neither deserved her.  But you can draw your own conclusion.  This is an excellent movie, and I highly recommend seeing it.
B00006IR5S|5.0|Yet again, John Williams proves to us that he is indeed one of the best film composers of all time.<br />Themes from the Harry Potter movies have stuck in our heads and won´t leave. &quot;Hedwig´s Theme&quot; from Harry Potter 1 was a milestone, one of a kind, and the themes on this cd sometimes surpasses the ones on the first soundtrack.<br />Just listen to themes like &quot;Fawkes the Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Dobby the House Elf&quot; and you´ll see what I mean. In the meantime - send a thought to John Williams, one of our greatest film composers.
B00006RCNW|5.0|WOW  !!!!!  What can I say? !!! This series will hook you hard. I cant stop watching, It gets better and better. The Drama is huge and the Plot always blows your mind!!!! A must see<br /> You wont regret.... My only regret is I only have 2 episodes left...
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Everybody can now take a deep breath; it turns out Hollywood still has a few tricks up its sleeve.  In an age of brain-dead cookie-cutter action flicks and puerile teen &quot;comedies&quot;, it's rare to see a film that flexes its creative muscle and does something new and relevant with motion picture.  Christopher Nolan's suspense thriller Memento does precisely this, and it's a wonderful experience.  The protagonist is Leonard Shelby (played with quiet intensity by Guy Pearce), a former insurance salesman who tries to hunt down the man who murdered his wife and inflicted brain damage on him.  The problem is that he suffers from anterograde amnesia - that is, he remembers everything before the attack, but is unable to make new memories.  He investigates the crime by writing  himself notes, taking polaroids of his peers and tattooing his body.  The movie is sequenced starting with the final events and works its way backward in the colour scenes.  The black and white scenes, however, are chronologically sequenced, with the two types of scenes meeting at the end.  The effect may be disorienting for the first couple of scenes, but it turns out to be much more than just a novelty.  This structure is integral in slowly revealing small surprises leading up to the expected revelation at the end.  The viewer is constantly paying close attention in finding clues to determine who is helping Leonard and who is setting him up.  Not since The Usual Suspects has a thriller commanded the audience to pay such attention to detail.  The multifaceted and often manipulative supporting characters keep the viewer on his/her toes;  the terrific performances by Carrie-Ann Moss (Natalie) and especially Joe Pantoliano (Teddy) do a wonderful job justifying the dubious level of trust that Leonard experiences.  Helpful advice - pay special attention to their body language.  The film is a grim commentary at how we often trivialize our remarkable capabilities; the tragic consequence of Sammy Jankis' condition particularly demonstrates the value of our ability to form memories - which we often take for granted.  What makes this film so relevant is that it refuses to settle for a simple, generic whodunit, using its innovative structure to build a tapestry of clues and characters, and also to &quot;put the audience in Leonard's shoes.&quot;  It is a film that tempts - some would argue that it requires - repeated viewings, and promotes active discussion long after the credits roll.  Most of all, it stimulates the mind without losing sight that a movie should also be entertaining.  This is a classic example of intelligent movie-making.
B00005YW4H|5.0|The minute I heard her sing I knew another one of the best female vocalists had come along again. I've been fortunate to hear most of them, Ella, Sarah, Peggy Lee, Kay Starr, Jo Stafford, Barbra, Dinah, Joan Baez, even Billie Holiday. Norah's voice, phrasing, and arrangements are personal, her own muse. She's also beautiful and a wonderful performer. Best of all she writes much of her own music which most of the singers mentioned didn't. She's great, she's it, and she'll be around for a lifetime
B00000K3D4|4.0|What starts out as a normal night for Sarah, being stuck at home babysitting her brother, starts into a fantastical adventure into another world.  Sarah wishes her brother gone and the Goblin King answers that call.  Sarah must journey into the Goblin King's land to try and get her brother back.  What she dosen't realize is that his Labyrinth has many twists and turns.  The storyline is not only great in this movie but so isn't the acting.  The music is great, as well, and they choose the best person for the Goblin King part.  You can tell Henson put alot of work into this movie.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My husband loves historical documentaries and war movies. We do not have cable movie channels so were not able to watch this when it was actually on. The DVD set is so wonderful. I got it for hubby for Christmas and he has watched it over and over. What a great series and a MUST for history buffs. I have never been into war movies and find myself riveted to this story. Highly recommended!!
0316666343|5.0|I liked this book ever since I had a glimpse of it online, when I started reading the first few pages. I couldn't wait for it to arrive when I ordered it to continue where I left.<BR>I found it very emotional, you laugh, cry (alot). The story isn't exactly about the girl who was murdered Suzie Salmon but about her coming to terms with leaving the family and loved one behind on Earth. As she watches she yearns to intervene between her parents who are falling apart. She hears their thoughts which is a good feeling.<BR>I highly recommednd the book ... it's sure to warm the heart ... incredible story!
B00006M183|5.0|As with any great ablum or band for that matter, it will take more than one listen to &quot;get&quot; the music. While i dont feel this ablum is their best, it still rocks and has some great songs on it. <br />A few years back the end of good music had come, great bands like alice n chains, soundgarden, smashing pumpkins were no more....empty meaningless drivel music had made its return with the likes of korn, limp bizcut, papa roach and others. but during this time pearl jam kept quietly releasing great music. But i do feel something different with this cd and with several other new releases, like zwan for instance...i feel a turn in music coming...maybe not this year but within the next 2 or 3 years...maybe thats hopeful thinking but regardless this record is a great one, however as i said before i do not feel it is their best but it is thier most artistic accomplishment to date.
B0000640VO|2.0|I like quirky movies and I am an open minded person. However, I thought this movie sucked. Maybe because I was reading French for two hours at one o clock in the morning. I thought that the characters were very bizarre, and Amelie couldn't seem to make up her mind about some things that were quite obvious to the viewer. I heard that this was a romantic  and fairy tale like movie. If that is what youre looking for, I'd check out chocolat. The characters are wonderful, johnny depp is totally hot in it, and it has a nice story line.
0316666343|4.0|From page one, you won't be able to put this book down.  Although a tragic tale, you can't help feeling hopeful in the end.  Well worth reading.  Eloquently written, suspenseful, and captivating.
B000021YQV|5.0|The first time I heard this CD at a friend's house, I hated it. But after another listen or two, I ended up loving it. The lyrics are insightful and political, and are paired with driving, heavy riffs. The best songs are definitely Aerials, Chop Suey!, Toxicity, Prison Song, Forest, Needles and Science. However, all of them are good and they are the type of songs that will get you pumped really easily. If you like hard rock, chances are you will like this album.<br />( I have also heard Steal This Album, which has some of the unreleased material from the Toxicity recording session. It is very good too.)
0393317552|5.0|I will not summarize the book, since others have done a good job on that matter. Rather, I would like to focus (1) on the strenghts, and (2) the weakneses of this book. <br />(1) It has been a challenge for scholars to explain the state of the world without making simplistic assumptions about human nature or culture (some races are inherently superior to others, some countries exploit others, some religions or languages promote technological change better than others, etc.).<br />In this respect, Diamond proposes an alternative (very simple and intuitive) framework with which to study humanity's early development. His proposal is that geographical-environmental factors imposed constraints and therefore determined the opportuinity of any given human group to achieve societal or technological break througs.<br />To name just  a few of them, he presents very compelling evidence that a region's size and climatical characteristics determined the probability of the evolution of relatively high-yielding grain crops, which in turn increased the chances of any given human group to discover agriculture and to find it worth his while to switch from a hunting-gathering lifestyle to a life of farming. <br />An agricultural life style, with its higher output of food per unit of surface would also result in higher population density and food surpluses, which in turn would create both the need and opportunity for achieving labor specialisation, which resulted in breakthroughs in government, science and technology (both commercial and military), and business.<br />In this same manner he comments on the impact of the availability of domesticable animals (like horses and cattle) in some areas, which in turn helped to increase productivity in farming, transport and the military, not to mention that the parallel coevolution of such groups and beasts resulted in the development of diseases that wiped out competing societies that lacked immunity to it.<br />You might be convinced by thisarguments or not, but I believe that anybody with an interest in human history should read them very carefully. I personally believe that the evidence presented is massive but worthwhile. <br />In this respect, I simply don't undestand those people who think that the book is too long. I agree that it is a bit repetitive on its main thesis, however, it couldn't be helped. As it is, the topic is extremely complex (not to mention controversial), so the only way to build a good case is to analyse the available data in the most thorough manner.<br />(2) I am sure that a book of this scope, which combines evidence from so many fields (archaeology, anthropology, epidemiology, geography, ecology, etc.) must be weak on some areas, although as a whole, the general hipothesis seems very compelling to me.<br />I don't agree with other reviewers that believe that he ignores all evidence that contradicts his thesis, although, I think that it is true that he failed in is intent of explaining why Europe beat China to the modern age, through geographical-environmental factors.<br />This does not mean that his main hipothesis is wrong, it only means that he didn't know when to quit. <br />At the present time, in which it is economically feasible to transport corn from one side of the world to the other at negligible prices, it is obvious that institutional factors (like trade barriers or an inadequate judicial system) are far more important than geographical factors in determining any country's economic success.<br />Well, although that certainly was not the case in the 1500s, that was the time in which other forces, like technological breakthrougs in transport, trade, the military and political organization, among others, started to dominate the future of mankind (at least temporarily) rather than geography and environment. <br />Nevertheless, I believe that this is one of the best books that I have read in a very long time.
B00006LLNU|2.0|I thought their last two releases comprised some of the most beautiful, fresh, progressive, emotional music in the last few years.  But this recording is a big step down.  You know how much you love the Nothing Song, and appreciate the live versions you download through file sharing?  Well, here the version lacks any of the pathos, any of the despairing urgency.  Rather, all of the songs on this album homogenously blend together in a kind of self-loving soup.  As we hear the same couple of words repeated over and over, the music never goes anywhere, and its one groove isn't particularly profound or heart-rending.  Rather than moving and fresh --as their last two albums-- the listener is now left feeling the lead singer is some really pretentious guy singing in the shower.  Self-love and complacency come across here, rather than the pensiveness and raw, quiet emotions that made them great.
B000002LOM|3.0|I bought this album as a mistake. I meant to purchase \\"Your Arsenal\\" at a used cd store and I noticed when I took it home \\"Kill Uncle\\" was inside so I managed to check it out before I returned it, I think the highlight of this album was obviously Sing Your Life. I realized all of the odd numbered tracks are the ones I really liked. I think all of the even tracks in between were just thrown in to complete the album. I would give it a 2.5 because only half of the album is worth listening to.
B00005T30L|5.0|This film is truly fabulous. As a new college student, I can totally relate to this film. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson gave such superb performances; you'd believe that they came straight out of your own high school. I think that this film is something that you can watch over and over, and still totally relate and reminsine over. BUY IT!! you won't be disappointed, I guarantee it.
0679745203|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and its beautifully told intertwining stories. Nonetheless, it does appears to be several stories loosely linked into a central narrative. Each of the stories is suberbly crafted and the writing is exceptional. But at times, I could not see the overall theme of the writer and where he thought it all fitted.<br />It is almost like several short stories mixed together and then placing the characters togther at the end of the war as they sort out their lives.<br />Despite this weakness, I loved the description of the desert and the trips through the wilderness. The love story is imaginatively told and the bomb decommissioning scenes are harrowing.
B0000640S1|5.0|This is my all time favorite Stallone Movie. Many<br />serious movie watchers pass this film up as just<br />another \\"shoot em up\\" action film and they see<br />Sly as a dummy because of his work in Rocky, but<br />that is a narrow minded opinion. You shouldnt judge<br />so harshly untill you see this film. Sly plays a<br />vietnam war hero drifter who gets more then a hard<br />time from the local police force in a small town.<br />This film shows the ignorance and disrespect that<br />our vietnam vets were shown when they came home<br />and how they delt with harassment, friends who died<br />in battle and the horrific flashbacks that plauged<br />some of their lives. First blood stirs alot of emotion<br />and is action filled! Its a work of art! Its a shame<br />that the Rambo sequals made people forget that Rambo 1<br />\\"first blood\\" is more then just action.
6305428042|4.0|If you want a true representation of Witches then don't watch this movie! However, if camp, fun and laughs is what you're after then give it a go.  It's just scary enough for the entire family, so you won't have to put the children to bed first.  In fact, children will identify with the heroes.  Please do, however, explain the truth about Witches to them before you watch it so that they'll understand this is FICTION.<br />Even though it's so bad for the Craft, I still love it.  A guilty pleasure perhaps?
0312305060|5.0|I wanted to read this book for a few years now since it's publication, but I never did. But when the movie came out and has so far been highly awarded as well I thought I should give the book a read. I have not seen the movie and I'm not sure about the movie after I read the amazing Novel. I'm so glad I started with Cunningham's novel because it is in one word: beautiful. I am a Woolf fan as well and I was amazed by how Cunningham was able to take the true essense of Woolf and create a truly different and complex novel. What is amazing about Woolf and Cunningham is the depth they place behind the characters. There is little talking in the book and little plot, but what is behind what is being said and done is the true message. Woolf's whole idea in writing was to explore the silence between people, all things left unsaid, all our inner thoughts and emotions, and in the end the big question is: do we ever truly know another human being? Cunningham has the very same ability in this novel as Woolf does in hers. I read this novel so quickly all in one day and I just felt tired afterward, I was drained of feeling. At first, as with Woolf's novels, I was depressed by the book, but I think going back and looking at it again I see the hint of hope that lies in the end of the novel, which is how many of Woolf's novels work as well. I highly recommend this amazing story of three women who all seem to be lacking something in their lives. Follow them through one day and explore the hours that help create them as complex and truly amazingly written characters. <BR>My advice would be to read the novel before viewing the film. I plan to see the movie but I fear it will go against everything that Woolf and Cunningham are aiming at, I hope I'm surprised by the movie, but regardless this book is worth your Hours.
B000002UAO|5.0|This is, of course, a good record, and I am surprised that I like it more than I like &quot;Revolver&quot; - I thought that what with &quot;Revolver&quot;s complex experimentation I would like it more, but I prefer &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. I think that the reason is that &quot;RS&quot; is more rounded-out, with all of the songs sounding similar and dealing with (mostly) the same subject matter. you couldn't take any one song away without hurting the whole. This makes for a very strong, cohesive album in my opinion.<br />This is the first part of the Beatles' two-album turning point; the seeds of their fertile genius, planted on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, will germinate on &quot;Revolver&quot; of next year. This album shows off the Beatles' amazing innate sense of harmony and wonderful guitar work. And, as usual, Ringo is fabulous on his six-piece kit. How does he do it? SIMPLICITY.<br />My favorite tracks are the first three: &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, &quot;You Won't See Me&quot;, and of course &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;. if you thought that Ringo was a minimalist in earlier albums, this song proves the point. He only uses the tambourine, and that on only the last half of the song!
B00005JL2O|4.0|Though Goldmember is not as ingenious as the first Austin Powers, nor was it as funny as the second film, I would have to say that Goldmember is still a very funny movie and for this to be the third installment of a comedy and to still be funny is pretty incredible.<br />Mike Myers is amazing. He can pull off so many characters so well that he is practically a one-man show.  The movie itself also boasts a pretty interesting and wacky storyline that Austin Powers fans will really enjoy. If you have not seen the previous two movies, it is not really necessary to, though you should take the time to see them.  In the movie itself, we meet Austin's father, a new villain named Goldmember, the new spy girl Foxy and a bunch of the characters from the previous movies. They take part in a crazy new adventure that is as bizarre as it is funny, and in the end, leaves room for a sequel, to the delight of all the fans.<br />This is not a bad DVD to check out if you were thinking of getting it.  Lots of great stuff is featured on the DVD and the movie is very entertaining.
B000002UAR|4.0|&quot;Revolver&quot; is a great album, with tons of great songs, and all sorts of innovations ranging from the warped count-in at the beginning to the tape loops at the end. But I couldn't help but feel that the record was disjointed - it seems that with so many fabulous new techniques in their heads, the Beatles almost overwhelmed themselves. It's too bad that &quot;long songs&quot; weren't in fashion yet; if they were I'm sure that &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; would have worked as a seven-minute-long song, and that &quot;Love You To&quot; would have continued for a good ten minutes more, and we might have had the first &quot;Progressive&quot; album in our hands. But that would not be for another three years, and so we have to be content with what we have.<br />The innovative songs: basically all of them, with &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Love You To&quot;, &quot;She Said She Said&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; standing out, for the respective reasons of backwards Guitars, Indian classicism, changing time signatures, and tape loops. The loops on &quot;TNK&quot; are particularly nice, and actually harmonize with the song proper.<br />My favorite songs: most of them, with the possible exception of &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot; (cheezy horn section). A very good album overall, one that I would reccomend to almost anyone.
B00005JLCI|5.0|this IS Hamlet, as it should have always been. Kenneth Branagh is Shakespeare re-incarnate.
B000001E7L|5.0|If you have to buy just one Cranberries CD, this is it! This is in my opinion, their best work. Dolores's voice is beautiful and really makes you think about what she's saying. The best songs on here are &quot;Ode to My Family&quot; &quot;Twenty One&quot; &quot;Zombie&quot; &quot;Empty&quot; &quot;Everything I said&quot; &quot;The icicle melts&quot; &quot;Disappointment&quot; and a personal favorite of mine &quot;Ridiculous thoughts&quot; &quot; I love the ending of that song! It's the closest to screaming I've ever heard her sing. I also love the backround vocals, they make the songs seem so much softer especially on &quot;Everything I Said&quot; and &quot;Disappointment&quot; So in conclusion, no matter what kind of music you listen to, you should definitely buy this CD.
B00005AFVR|4.0|Like Live 1975-1985, his previous live album with the E Street Band, this album is criticized for what it is not.  At least the first set tried to be a career retrospective, even if it was heavily weighted towards the stadium shows of the mid 80s.  In this case, I believe that the complaints are valid- the structuring of the CD and the missing songs from Bruce's Reunion tour concerts are quite frustrating.  Would it have been so difficult to release an entire, minimally edited concert?  Given Bruce's intensely loyal following, and the lengths that some of his fans go to obtain shoddy-sounding bootlegs, I think that a 3-disc set with an entire show would have sold just as many copies, and have satisfied many of his longtime fans.  At this point in his career, I don't think that Springsteen is trying to win new fans with his live releases, so there's no need to \\"dumb down\\" the CD.  Based on numbers, it looks like this CD sold only to a select group of fans (as opposed to \\"The Rising\\", with sales in the millions)- I'm sure many of us would have paid a few more dollars for a third CD.  Why he refuses to release an entire concert, or better yet, a series of them highlighting his many historic tours, is beyond me and a source of great frustration to many of his fans.  There is clearly a market for his live releases, but the one man who could do it seems reluctant at best, and completely opposed at worst.  Hopefully the trends started by bands like The Dead, Pearl Jam, Dave Matthews, The Who, Phish and even Dylan with his bootleg series, will make cut-and-paste live albums like this obsolete.  Overall, you get the feeling that this album is somewhat sloppily assembled, and at the very least lacks the nearly obsessive attention which Bruce devotes to his other releases.  You just can't help but realize that there is much lost potential on this CD.<br />That being said, the performances on here are top-notch, and they catch Bruce and the E Street Band at their finest. It does a great job of capturing the first half of the show, with the powerhouse 5-song set of Youngstown-Murder Inc.-Baldands-Out in the Street-Tenth Ave Freezout being the highlight.  We finally get live versions of Prove it All Night and Jungleland, and 20+ years down the road have not diminished these songs at all.  The nearly 20 minute version of Tenth Ave Freezeout may or may not hold up over repeated listenings, but it was the centerpiece of this tour and belongs on the CD.  Mansion on the Hill, as a countrified duet with Patti Scialfa, is also a highlight and one of Bruce's most beautiful performances.  I didn't necessarily appreciate this one in the several concerts in which I saw it performed, but I love it on the CD.  Bruce was also thoughtful enough to include an ultra-rare version of Lost in the Flood- not my favorite song, but still a fine moment when he drags out these rarities.  I don't care for the rendition of The River- Bruce has taken his most melodious song and stripped it down to a dry, pseudo-jazzy dirge.  Many of his reworkings of classics are equal to their original versions (the acoustic Born to Run, piano Thunder Road, etc.), but this one doesn't hold up for me.  And the version of BIUSA, while intense with its guitar work, is a little monotonous and tedious.  Still, even these songs are essential Springsteen performances, and don't in any way diminish the overall power of the recordings.<br />So my 4-star rating comes from what is lacking on the CD.  Live recordings from Bruce Springsteen are precious, and you certainly get plenty of it here.  Eventually we'll get what we want from Bruce- his recent moves with the promotion of The Rising are signs that for better or worse he's loosening up.  Someday we'll get to that place where we really wanna go and we'll walk in the sun, but 'til then, tramps like us...
B0000640SA|5.0|Memento is one of those movies that had to be watched with full atention, the story as all of you know is about a man that is unable to have recent memories, who's looking for his wife's killer (it looks pretty simple but it ain't). The movie goes in a series of B&amp;W and color scenes developing the story (the color scenes tell part of the story backwards, and the B&amp;W in the right order), so the spectator has to order all the information to get pieces together, a brilliant and interesting idea, the result is an awesome thriller, the special edition has and extra hidden feature that allows to understand the movie very well, if you want to see alll the story in the right order you have to insert disc-2 in your dvd player, when the image of a psychologic test appears mark the clock, then you wiil be asked a series of questions, answer &quot;C&quot; all times, the you'll be asked to put in the right order a series of 4 drawings of a woman fixing a flat tire, answer this in reverse order (form the end to beginning) and BINGO! the movie will start from the credits to the beginning (showing the scenes in the right order, and you'll be able to watch the story as it happened. Technically the picture is fine with no artifacts , and the dts track performs beatufully in a fine tuned system, watch the movie and solve the puzzle, you won't be dissapointed.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is honestly the best punk album anyone can own. Johnny Rotten (AKA John Lydon) is masterful with lyric writing and his lyrics are witty and he has has definately influnced music with his anti-everyhing mentality and distinctive voice. Steve Jones is a fantastic guitar player, and he also sounds great with his later band Neurotic Outsiders (who also have an album which both Guns and Roses fans and Sex Pistols fans would enjoy).Sid Vicious is the punk icon of self destruction, but he added to the image and would the Sex Pistols really be the Sex Pistols without him?No,of course not. All the songs on this album are great especially \\"Holidays in the Sun\\", \\"Bodies\\", and my personal favorites are \\"No Feelings\\"(which has amusing lyrics) and \\"Liar\\"( which has a great bass line). \\"Anarchy in the UK\\"  is probably their most well known song but is definately not the best. Also,\\"God Save the Queen\\" is a classic. PUNK ROCKERS MUST HAVE THIS ALBUM!!!.One cannot be called a true punk rocker without owning this album. THe album is timeless and the views of the Sex Pistols still hold true today by punk rockers, both in the united states and in the UK.All of the Sex Pistols albums are great but this one is the best. I guarentee that you will like it! IF you dont, then obveously punk rock is not your thing.The Sex Pistols have been my favorite band for about 4 years, so what more can I say?GOD SAVE THE SEX PISTOLS!
0060278250|5.0|I loved Sabriel and Lirael, but this topped them both, making it my favorite book. Just read this series you won't regret it!
B000068PQ0|5.0|I was thumbing through some cds at the library the other day and came across this. I had heard much about this cd so I checked it out. I was very happy that I did. I've never really listened to the Lips before, with the possible exception being the cd that featured &quot;She Don't Use Jelly.&quot; This album has some great tracks. I couldn't believe how the music stuck itself in my head; not in that annoying way, but in the way that drives one to listen over and over. I went out and bought the thing, while at the same time trying to listen to some of their other releases. I just can't believe I had never listened to them before. This cd is definitely worth the money.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Being an old system fan, i was majorly dissapointed with the release of toxicity - a collection of melodic garbage that was in NO way nearly as good as the powerful masterpiece that was their debut album, System of a Down. Not too long after Toxicity came out, i soon began to hear all this buzz about a new System album, which they were forced to begin work on because of a leakage of 30 or so previously unreleased tracks. Well, after hearing Toxicity, i wasnt really sure if i wanted to give this album a shot or not. But i felt a need to stay loyal to System - after all, i still listen to their debut album. So i got online and downloaded a bunch of songs, and a month later, i bought the CD. I can tell you right now, that although i was expecting to once again be let down,  i was literally BLOWN AWAY by the material on 'Steal This Album!'. <BR>This album is in almost NO WAY like Toxicity, and System will be remembered for it for years to come. Anyway, you've probably heard enough blabbering from me, so i'll just skip all the BS and cut to the chase. Here is my review of every song on the CD:<br />Chic 'n' Stu - WOW! Talk about fast paced and loud. This is what system is about folks - heaviness, speed, and incredibly ODD lyrics. 10/10<br />Innervision - This is the song they're pushing to make the next single. Its a good song, although it does have a toxicity influence... btw, System always amazes me, with this song they managed to cliche a word no one ever uses! Haha despite the fact that they used the word Innervision too much in this track, i really do enjoy it, so i'll give it a 8/10<br />Bubbles - Great song... i really like this one. From the brutallity of the guitars to the masculent mating call of Daron, everything about this song is great... 10/10<br />Boom! - GREAT song. i love this song. Serj sings in a sort of monotonous voice in this one and it makes for some really eerie effects. Nesides that though, the song has awesome lyrics, too. (PS. - if you like this song, u'll like the prerelease better) 10/10<br />Nuguns - This song is... well, lets put it this way, its not their best. I really think this song could have been so much better, but the annoying vocals in the chorus kind of ruin it for me. This one gets a 7/10<br />A.D.D. - American Dream Denial! Serj shows off his lyrical talent once again in this war-inspired (or uninspired?) title. The chorus in this song is AMAZING 10/10<br />Mr. Jack - This song blows - a LOT. but out of all the songs on the album, i probably listen to this song more than any other.  Why? because the ending to this song - the last 40 seconds or so - kicks ...! Never in my life have i ever heard as good an ending to a song! The song starts slow and ends with a bang. REAL heavy towards the end.... 11/10 (yes, 11)<br />IEAIAIO - Good song. SoaD at it's best. 10/10<br />36 - the name is 36 but its only 46 seconds long... I wish it could be longer. 11/10<br />Pictures - haha awesome song. Too bad the chorus isnt very common in this song.. the chorus owns. 9/10<br />Highway Song - I loved the prerelease version of this song... It was easily my favorite song on the album. But with the release of a more produced version of this song, i feel they ruined what made this song so great... They got rid of the jibberish and added a second voice in the ending segment, but thats okay, its still a good song. 9/10<br />F*** The System - Hahaha this track is hilarious, although its meant to be serious. Oh well, great effort here guys. Word up 10/10<br />Track 13, whatever its called - WHAT IS THIS? this track ..., thats all i have to say. 3/10<br />Thetawaves - Good song, i love the prechorus. But not so much the chorus. 8/10<br />Roulette - U know, if it werent for the lyrics to this song, i would probably hate it... 10/10<br />Streamline - Good song, but like F*** the System and Innervision, its been out for a while, and it has gotten a little old. 9/10
B00000JSPE|5.0|In the early 90's, the New Kids On The Block split up and they were replaced by a much more sophisticated, and more talented group of boys named Take That. They were from Manchester, England and they loved to party. From 1992 until 1995, Take That was the name that every teenager and every teenybopper knew. They were huge. They made 8 number one hit singles in the UK and three number one hit albums. This greatest hits compilation was their last number one album released in February of 1996, the time when Take That called it quits. <BR>The compilation features all the singles from the very first to the very last. The highlights here are no secret, Back For Good has got to be one of the finest songs ever written. The song's got melody, a catchy chorus and beautiful harmony. It was Take That's biggest song released and their breakthrough hit in America. Pray and Relight My Fire, both number ones, are bubblegum pop classics, Babe, another number one, is a genuine soap opera turned into a song type. While Love Ain't Here Anymore tends to lean more towards the rhythm and blues section. A Million Love Songs competes with Back For Good for the favorite Take That love ballad, and the boyish voice of Robbie Williams (a young man back then) empowers the groovy chart topper Everything Changes. Why Can't I Wake Up With You, It Only Takes A Minute, and Could It Be Magic add a nice tasty flavor to the theme of album's high energy pop sound. And if that's not enough for you, the extraordinary number one hit cover version of The BeeGees' How Deep Is Your Love tops it all up giving the entire album a very good opening.<br />Of course after the band disbanded, there was nothing much coming out of the members except maybe for the development of superstardom for Robbie Williams and a fall from grace for Gary Barlow who is least heard of nowadays but still making music. <BR>The majority of the songs are written solely by Gary. One track, Babe, is co-written by Mark, and another, Sure, isco-written by Robbie. <br />How ever long it might take Take That to possibly reunite, if never, the world will Never Forget what a huge impact they were in the music industry back in those glorious years in the 90's.<br />This compilation is a must-have.
0316666343|3.0|After all the hype ('People' deemed it the best novel of last year), I jumped on the 56-person waiting list at the library.  I was shocked when I was next after only 3 weeks - after reading this, I see why. <br />The premise, in the hands of an experienced author, really could have been handled  well but after the first few chapters, I was just plain bored.  I should have felt for these characters yet felt not much of anything - not even for the girl.  The whole story was so blase.  The characters were not only boring but bored themselves.  Where was the passion?  The gut wrenching? I should have hated 'Mr. Harvey'; I should have felt the grief of the parents; I should have cried for the girl. Heaven sure sounds like one boring bummer.<br />And the end. What WAS that?  I guess she figured she had to get sex in somewhere to sell this and convulated the ending to accomodate it. <br />It amazes me how amateurish the latest best sellers have been. I could have written a book this vanilla. We really need the equivalent of an 'American Idol' Simon to start reviewing books before they are allowed to be mass marketed.  I'm just getting so tired of wasting what little eyesight I have on stuff like this.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Being a fan of &quot;old world jazz&quot; like the Nat King Cole Trio and Ella Fitzgerald, I am usually quite hesitant to listen to younger, fresher voices singing jazzy songs.  But boy am I glad I gave this kid a chance.  He so smoothly mixes jazz, blues, folk, and his own unique blend of spice and pizazz I listened to the album strait through, twice.  His lyrics are an adorably mature take on immature and adolescent ideas.  He writes what he feels and so easily expresses it all. If you are a fan of just plain old GOOD music than look no further.  With an absolutely charming and captivating smile and personality, an eerily soothing voice, and smart and positively lovely lyrics, I am sure this kid is going to be around for a very long time; and rightfully so.  Bravo John, Bravo!!
B00001U0DP|5.0|This movie is fabulous.  It is touching, serious and funny.  You walk away with a real sense of how life was for this family.  You also walk away with tears in your eyes.  It is one of my favorites.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Thank you Russia, for this great, upbeat compilation that actually has a message. One of the year's best pop releases so far!
6305508550|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I thought \\"funny, but bosses and companies around here don't run quite like that.\\"  <br />Then I switched jobs.  The guys in the group secretly quoted \\"Office Space\\" lines when referring to our boss.  I realized that I in fact DO live in this world.<br />This movie is a classic.  If you've spent any time in your life in cubicleland with dress down Fridays, you will appreciate this movie. []
B00005JLIU|4.0|\\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\" is a reminder that once upon a time in Hollywood singing stars made B-musicals.  Here is a classic example from the career of Julie Andrews that reminds us her career was not all mega-hits like \\"Sound of Music\\" and super-flops like \\"Star.\\"  Unfortunately for lovers of musicals Hollywood stopped marking movies like this, leaving singing stars with Olivia Newton-John with a smash like \\"Grease\\" and a bomb like \\"Xanadu\\" with nothing in between.  I also have fond memories of \\"Thorough Modern Millie\\" because it was a movie that was shown to us in class in high school; the reason why we were allowed this privilege is beyond me, unless we were supposed to get an appreciation of the Roaring Twenties from this film (so why did they show us the original version of \\"The Blob?\\").<br />Our flapper heroine is Millie Dillmount (Andrews), who has decided to be a \\"mod\\" and turned in her long curls for a stylish bob.  Her goal in life is to marry her boss and after interviewing several possibilities she hits the jackpot with Trevor Graydon (John Gavin), who hires her as his stenog and calls Millie \\"John\\" (as in \\"Johnny on the spot\\").  Millie likes young Jimmy (James Fox), who impresses her by inventing a new dance called the Tapioca and being a swell kisser, but he is poor and Millie has her ambitions.  Millie's best gal-al is Miss Dorothy (Mary Tyler Moore), who is sweet, innocent, and has lots of curls.<br />However, the life of Millie and her friends are caught between two imposing characters.  At the hotel for young women where Millie lives there is Mrs. Meers (Beatrice Lillie), who is always looking out for young girls who are \\"all alone in the world,\\" like Miss Dorothy, who could be of use to a Chinese White Slavery ring.  But Millie also encounters an unstoppable force for life in the person of the irrepressible Muzzy (Carol Channing), who lives the good life at her Long Island \\"Cottage\\" estate and pops up at key moments throughout the narrative.<br />The movie is not a great musical, mainly because it does not have any really great songs (as evidenced by the fact that the current Broadway musical has almost entirely new songs), but it is still great fun.  Director George Roy Hill takes advantage of Andrews' comic flair and the film has great fun with her double takes and comic title cards as Millie periodically comments on the proceedings.  The movie does employ stereotypes of the Chinese, but you have to admit these are balanced between the comic relief of Mrs. Meers' henchmen (Jack Soo and Pat Morita) and the wise old Tea (Philip Ahn).<br />\\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\" won an Oscar for music and Channing was nominated for supporting role (she won a Golden Globe for her efforts, were clearly tailored to her style).  But Lillie is a delight as well and I personally enjoy Gavin's mock-heroic performance.  Moore just has to look sweet, although she does get to say a bad word (!), and Fox is charming although clearly too young for Andrews.  Unfortunately the debacle of \\"Star\\" pretty much derailed Andrews' musical career in Hollywood, which is a loss because the comic flair she shows here is the same that she showcased in films like \\"Victor, Victoria\\" a couple of decades later.  The good news is that the Broadway show will bring this film back to the public's notice; I am sure that is the reason I have spent the morning watch the film on TV./>The movie is not a great musical, mainly because it does not have any really great songs (as evidenced by the fact that the current Broadway musical has almost entirely new songs), but it is still great fun.

B00004TRD8|5.0|Terminator 2 marks a rare occurance in film history, it's better than the first one! Yes that it very rare, how many times have that happened. Not many I can think of. After James Cameron pushed the envelope of computer-generated special effects in The Abyss, he turned this hotly anticipated sequel to Terminator into a well-written, action-packed showcase for advanced special effects and for one of the most invincible villains ever imagined. The bad guy in the previous is now the good guy fighting an even more powerful villian, T-1000 ), whose liquid-metal construction makes him seemingly unstoppable. The fate of the future lies in the balance, with Linda Hamilton reprising her role as the rugged woman whose son will change the course of history. The third installment is coming out soon, and I suggest seeing all of them. If you're going to buy this one, buy the first as well. 5 Stars definately deserved.
B000002LOE|5.0|This was the album that introduced me to R.E.M. 13 years ago. It will always hold a special place in my heart. While often misunderstood, &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; is a fantastic love song. Nor do all R.E.M. fans despise &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; as it was made to be a silly pop song. It defintely stands out though from the other songs in Out of Time. Low and Texarkana both have just incredible instrumental and vocal sounds. Take the album for what it is, an end of the 80's start of the 90's album. Also, look at the lyrics. It is totally classic R.E.M. style, but it's the first time that they strayed from being the political college band they were known to be. R.E.M. reinvents themselves with each album, and this is proof of it. Is it their best album? No. But it still is fantastic.
B00005QCYC|5.0|Three great movies. All about dinosaurs, full of great acting, great special effects, and of course DINOSAURS. Here is my ratings for the Jurassic Park movies:<br />Jurassic Park: 5/5<br />Lost World Jurassic Park: 2/5<br />Jurassic Park 3: 3.5/5<br />It is worth the price and if you're going to see one, see them all. 5 stars for the entire movie set, that I got for a great deal.
B00004XMS0|4.0|Normally, I would've rated this with 5 stars, but unfortunately, &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, the 4th in the series thus far, was poorly produced. But let's keep this current. As of January 28th, 2003, it was announced that they will, in fact, be making more batman movies. We can only hope that they will be closer to the legend of Bruce Wayne's alter ego as was captured in 1989's Batman, directed by Tim Burton.<BR>     My idea of Gotham city, the world of Batman, is a dark and grizzled one, full of 'goth' architecture, and knarled, twisted, alleys, matching it's brand of psychotic criminals that inhabit Gotham city. My idea of a man capable of performing such a feat of technology, intelligence, strength, martial arts, skill, and detective mastery, not to mention pure vengeful determination as to adequately wear the cowl can be a disturbing one. Taken into account that we are talking about someone purely fictional is often relief, but also a tale of tragedy turned into triumph. I still marvel (snicker) at the special effects accomplished for all 4 movies, no matter how poor the 4th installment was. Regarding the movies themself: Usually the first in the series is the best and would be for this series starter as well. Batman was brilliantly filmed, and Jack Nicholson as the Joker was perfect. Regarding 'Returns', most people don't consider it as good as its predessor. I don't agree. I see 'Returns' as more of an internal movie, more psychological, which I thought was also well done. Another great Batman adventure with a different approach. Batman Forever was also done well, and quite honestly, I thought Val Kilmer made the role of Wayne/Batman more three-dimensional as opposed to the cardboard cutout that unfortunately Michael Keaton provided. The riddler was done flawlessly by Jim Carey and surprisingly, Robin was also introduced as a working character by Chris O'Donnell. However, when 'Batman &amp; Robin' was released it showed the inevitable clunkiness of the franchise due to an overproduced, overcommercialized mess of a movie with a weak plot. It's unfortunate to see the Batman series leave off with such a weak bookend. Hopefully, however, the next installment will be far better than this one. Otherwise, it's a great series of movies.
B00005N5S5|4.0|As we all know, this is the film that cemented Schwarzenegger's spot in the action-brawn firmament, and it was well deserved. He's chilling as the futuristic cyborg who kills without fear, without love, without mercy. James Cameron's story and direction are pared to the bone and all the more creepy. The Terminator robots are pretty cool looking, and the fact that this film causes you to think. Yes there are alot of explosions and a sex scene, but this film doesn't insult your intelligence. If you're going to buy this, get the MUCH BETTER sequel Terminator II: Judgement Day.
B00003CXA2|1.0|Even Roger Ebert (a smart critic even when you don't agree with him) is taken in by this ... visual and emotional trickery. But then he also describes Kevin Costner as \\"an intelligent actor\\". <br />Luckily, this film reaches the apex of its tastelessness early on, when Forrest's disingenuous voice-over narration accompanies actual footage of George Wallace getting gunned down. At least the producers avoid (though only just) treating us to the same for the Kennedy brothers. Presumably George Wallace, as a redneck, doesn't deserve the privacy accorded to Boston bluebloods.<br />The film constantly pokes fun at people and institutions - Black Panthers, hippies, drug addicts, the mentally retarded, the Army, war, the Presidency, and so on - without staying anywhere long enough to develop any redeeming satirical bite; staying just long enough to get the ... laugh and move on. Hanks is a great technician, as are his helpers, who cannot resist, for example, yet another chance to do the blue-screen trick with Gary Sinise's legs. And so far from \\"rubbing my eyes at the realism\\" of the anti-war rally scene (as Ebert says), by this time all I could say was \\"another damn trick\\". But that's what American movie-making is mostly about these days: one-liners and digital tricks.<br />Add to this dish a ... layer of bare-facedly ... sentimentality, and you have \\"Forrest Gump\\"  - a cinematic and emotional Bill of Goods.
B00006690F|3.0|I got this on an the day it came out and listened like three times.  None of the times did i really care for it, but I figured it'd have to grow on me..it didn't.  I'm more of a fan of horrorcore and as a result loved his first two, now he's just trying to be political and it doesn't work.  All kinds of girly teenyboppers think he's sweet because of \\"Haley's Song\\" but come on thats one of the worst ones.  I've lost almost all respect for him but My dad's gone crazy is listenable as is sing for the moment..there isn't much else for fans of his old stuff
0140187537|5.0|I read this book for American Lit in college.  Since then, I have read it 3 more times.  There is something about the main character and what happens to his life that is just so very....haunting.
0316666343|5.0|Just an articulate, beautiful view of our world from a very different perspective.  A powerful and engaging read.
B00003CXXM|4.0|I expected the action to really put foot to butt, but I hadn't expected Matt Damon's preformance to be so sharp. He's a figure of stoicism, with an underlying torrent of confusion and fear that occation explodes in frantic expression. He can't remember who or what he is, and unconsciously he fears that identity even before the pieces of his past begin to coalesce. Very well done.<br />I would have given five stars, but its not a movie that I would normally watch more than once or thrice. The DVD has some decent special features, but honestly I find even the best special features interesting only once. The action is tight, blindingly fast, and brutal; definitely worth a third or fourth helping in that regard. There isn't much else to draw me back however. This is a movie that, despite its high quality, one will watch infrequently and therefore should rent and not buy.
0425152251|5.0|You can always find huge books about philosophy and after a few pages you're totally lost, and have to start over again several times. But this one is different. Jostein Gaarder has sold this book all over the world, and I can see why!!<BR>I first started to read this book when I was 15 years old, and to be honest I found it boring and gave up after a few chapters. But having read it again now, 4 years later, I have a completely different view on the book. It's not hard to read and you can easily follow young Sophie's ways of thinking. To some point her ways of thinking can be reflected in your ways of thinking. Trying to understand who you are, where you're from and other ancient philosophical questions. Seeing the different aspects of thinking makes you start to think yourself.<br />I would recommend this to anyone older than 18. And espesially to those you want to learn something about philosophy without starting on books with a difficult language and content. And most important, all history of philosophy gathered in one place, to give you an easy overview on it. I had read this book before studying a semester of Philosophy, and it made the studies a lot easier! It's really worth to read, and you won't be disappointed.
B000002TQV|5.0|A new sound for music. An instant classic that contines to grow in popularity.
B000069CWE|5.0|This is the best linkin Park CD yet to come out.  They took the already excellent songs from Hybrid Theory and twisted them to make them even better.  The best song on the track in my opinion in Wth&gt;you. This song just blows you away when it starts.  It keeps true to the original song enough that it can be recognized as a remix, but it is also different enough that it feels like a new song.  The vocals are powerful throughout the song and they are powerful you just want to turn up the volume until the neighbours are banging on the walls.<BR>My only complaint lies with the phone message checking that happens for songs numbered 4, 10 and 16.  I dont understand what the point is, i just want more of that great music.
B00000JG41|5.0|It is very difficult to describe Mr. Bungle using words.  Each album is different, including this one.  When I first listened to them, in their first album, I was very much turned off.  However, that album grew on me very quickly.  This third album has evolved into my favorite.  The goals of the Mr. Bungle production seem to be something like this: these musicians are interested, not in selling a million albums, but expressing themselves artistically.  This music is, indeed, different!<br />California reminds me of the musical equivalent of films by David Lynch.  There is this indescribable feeling of warmth, emotion, mood, horror, sadness, silliness and strength when you hear this music.  It reminds me of a mixture of our idealistic eroding Americana imagery with a modern sense of disturbing reality.  Like Lynch material, there is a feeling of a really honest-to-goodness will for things to be better, as our dreams desire, but there is always the cold hard reality of living and dying--consider the song Pink Cigarette, about a guy who either dies from smoking or commits suicide over a cigarette-related romance.  Another favorite from this album is Retrovertigo, a tune, I hardly comprehend, but is very emotional.  These songs are all a great expression.<br />I find that when the day has been long, and I'm tired, California really provides an emotional release, helping me get rid of the load my shoulders have gathered.  I recommend this album if you are always looking for something different in what you want your ears to hear.
B0000024K1|5.0|I'm white. I am a classically trained pianist. And I know good musical structure when I hear it. Believe it or not, &quot;Millions&quot; is reminiscent of the evanescent (vanishes like vapor) quality which marks opera-- the lean musical riffs, the supercedence of vocal elocution, the excesss of emotional strain, the reverse grammar (&quot;the enemy public&quot; like &quot;un serpentello e amor&quot; from Mozart's Cosi fan tutte.)  That the lyrics themselves might exaggerate from fact-- love songs exaggerate. (C'mon Paul, if you don't care about money why don't you feed the poor with your millions and live in a shack?)  People should learn distich (look it up) like &quot;It's raw and keeping you on the floor/It's soul and keeping you in control&quot; along with &quot;This Land Is Your Land.&quot; &quot;Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope.&quot;
0783226888|5.0|Although this movie is somewhat predictable at times, I really like it. I have seen it many times and probably will see it many more. For comparison, also watch the 1973 film &quot;Day of the Jackal&quot;. Although that is very good, even with its 1970s limitations, I think &quot;The Jackal&quot; is better. The early version is probably true-to-life, but the latter is very realistic and definitely leaves you feeling that it is very possible. Thumbs up for the cinematography, for sure. Bruce Willis and Richard Gere do outstanding jobs. Great for a weekend evening flick.
0783226128|4.0|1983's Scarface is a remake of the 1932 gangster classic that starred Paul Muni.  Al Pacino gives a way over the top performance (including his much imitated Cuban accent) as Cuban refugee Tony Montana.  He arrives in Miami with his friend Manny Ray (Steven Bauer) and proceeds to build an empire built on the trafficking of cocaine.  But Tony is addicted to the white powder and it fuels his judgement which is poor in relationships with others.  He crosses one too many people and in the end suffers a bloody fate.  Blood is a prevalent aspect to film as it is an extremely violent and graphic movie.  While some may see the film as gratuitously violent, the characters are underworld criminals and brutal violence is a part of and a way of their lives.  Director Brian De Palma perfectly captures the colorful, sun-drenched hedonism of Miami and Oliver Stone's script is filled with detail.  The rest of cast is very good including Robert Loggia and a young Michelle Pfeiffer in one of her first roles as Tony's wife.  The one drawback to Scarface is that is much longer than necessary.  It is nearly three hours longs and it drags in places, if Mr. De Palma would have trimmed off about a half-hour, the film would be nearly brilliant.
0316666343|2.0|I was surprised to find this book on Time Magazine's list of 2002's best fiction. I began with great expectations, but alas, the book never really got off the ground. <br />The characters seem too light and superficial. Many promising premises are introduced: Susie's heaven, Ruth's connection with the dead, the extra-marital affair, Mr. Harvey's past. Sadly, none of these beginnings ever culminates into a satisfactory ending. They are all dealt with in a surfacy, nealtly bow-tied manner. None of the characters ever really deal with the consequences of the situations the author places them in. Susie's closure with Ray Singh and Mr. Harvey's fate are particularly disappointing. The author seems to have gotten bored with her own book and tried to end it as easily as possible.<br />There are a few interesting passages, but overall ... flat.
B00003BDXG|1.0|As any enlightened four year old already knows, we live in a culture that glorifies, revels in, exploits, promotes and perpetuates darkness. In other words, possessing a pessimistic and cynical vision of the world in general and American Culture in specific is taking the obvious and easy path. <br />Oliver Stone, with this film (along with the neo-noir \\"U-Turn\\" and others)attempts satire but ends up achieving what every artist strives to avoid: becoming that which they despise. By creating this loud, bleak, ultra violent, crude and mono-syllabic film, Stone simply ends up ultimately contributing to the prevailing apocalyptic winds currently blowing our culture into oblivion.<br />Beneath the ugly exterior of this unpleasent film lies an even uglier truth. Stone completely allows himself (as he does with most of his films)to be coopted by the powers of darkness which he claims to despise.<br />With \\"Natural Born Killers\\", Stone offers the viewer absolutely no hope. He gives us an entire film populated with drooling morons, allowing us no single empathetic character. Obviously Stone wants to draw symbollic parallels between the sex crazed, violent beasts in his narrative and we the viewers. Granted we are all complex characters containing flaws, but we also contain the capacity for human decency and beauty. By giving his characters nothing even remotely admirable, Stone is condemning all of us (and therefore himself- after all, he made the film)into a black hole of despair.<br />The film does indeed earn one star out of 5 for its admittedly brilliant use of cinema. Stone has always been a canny, if hyperactive, genius at manipulating the film medium. His utter fearlessness borders on the reckless as he deftly shifts film stocks, incorperates animation and gleefully jump cuts. Ironically though, his very mastery of the medium makes him the quintessential American director of the 1990's: overblown, overwrought, obnoxious and wastefull. Like mainstream American media (Ilaugh at those reviewers who wrongly call Stone \\"European\\" in vision as opposed to \\"American\\")Stone doesn't understand subtlety. As in all his films, Stone displays a Senecan knack for bludgeoning every point home. He knows absolutely no restraint. And what is more American than being abrupt, loud and rude?<br />Any viewers though who suffer from chronic migrain need to avoid Stone's canon, especially this film, as it does inspire head splitting agony.<br />The only reason many praise his films and demonize the all too similar hack Micheal Bay is because many like to call Oliver Stone a brave visionary.<br />Oliver Stone may be a visual genius, but he caters to the prevailing culture of darkness by simply stating the obvious (whereas Bay assumes his viewers are all idiots). It is not courageous in the least to be cynical and pessimistic. In fact, the opposite is true. As an artist and as a human being, it takes great courage to fight against ignorance and evil and show elements of hope. If Stone has no hope for America or mankind, as \\"NBK\\" suggests, then what is the point of making art? A true visionary steps out of Plato's cave and shows us what lays beyond our personal feeble dim visions. We already see the dark cave around us and the even darker and shallow shadows that flicker on the walls in front of us. \\"Natural Born Killers\\" as a movie is nothing more than a flashy dark shadow across our landscape.<br />Instead of purchasing this film, I reccomend the similar themed, but far better films: \\"Gun Crazy\\",\\"Bonnie And Clyde\\", \\"Badlands\\" (a quiet, beautiful film that NBK tries to be-but can't because it has no soul)and even Jonathan Demme's great but overlooked black romantic comedy \\"Something Wild\\". Each aforementioned film allows characters to posses weaknesses and beauty at the same time while simultaneously scewering and praising American culture.<br />Stone has managed to successfully achieve that wobbly tightrope with the magnificent films \\"Nixon\\" and \\"Born OnThe Forth Of July\\", but he fails here.
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is an incredible piece of rock music, and I feel is the best album of the last year. It seems every kind of emotion is captured by Chris Martin and greatly expressed with an alliance of drums, guitar, and a piano. <br />If there was a course in college called Bono101, Martin definetly aced it. I don't feel it comes out as much as other fans, but a lot of the elements that made u2 the biggest band in the world does show up in &quot;Rush of Blood to the Head.&quot; Martin's delivery is definetly similar to u2's lead man, and he's got some soul in his voice too.<br />Although comprised of many ballads, the first track is a fast, hard, drum-led track called &quot;Politik,&quot; with a catchy chorus in which Martin yells &quot;Open Up your Eyes...&quot; It's an excellent track which introduces the album very well, and is followed by the first single &quot;In My Place,&quot; which made me buy the CD...an incredible ballad.<br />Two other hidden gems on this album are &quot;The Scientist&quot; and &quot;Warning Sign,&quot; two ballads with excellent lyrics and delivery by Martin. Like &quot;In My Place,&quot; Coldplay seems to make simple songs but they are so well done they become so addictive. As most songs are on the slow side, they still keep the album upbeat with good tracks such as &quot;Whisper.&quot; But by far, in my opinion, the best track on this album is &quot;Clocks,&quot; its amazing!! Don't really have anything to say about it, just buy the CD for this track and listen to it, you'll then understand.<br />There are one or two skip overs on this album, not because their bad tracks but because they probably just won't grow on you. I'm a tough critic and would usually save the 5 stars for the &quot;Achtung Babys&quot; of rock, but what the hell, this is an incredible album. Coldplay will be around for awhile...
0312932081|1.0|Having an eleven year old defeat an alien<BR>civilization is a little implausible even<BR>for science fiction.  On top of that the<BR>writing seldom rises beyond the level of<BR>a young adult novel.  All in all a pretty<BR>grim and unrewarding read.
B000002LCU|5.0|As it says above, this is one of George's finest releases.  I think it falls just a bit short of All Things Must Pass (only because ATMP had nearly 20 songs, as opposed to Cloud Nine's 11...the quality of the songs is about the same), which seems to be the unanimous opinion.  Of course, this album has that slick production that made the 80's so famous.  However, love or hate the 80's, it is impossible to hate Cloud Nine.  There's not one weak track here.<BR>It's not possible to describe the songs without repeating words like &quot;awesome&quot; or &quot;incredible&quot; about fifty times, so I'll refrain from going over each and every song and just say that, with the possible but not definite exceptions of &quot;Breath Away From Heaven&quot; &amp; &quot;Wreck Of The Hesperus,&quot; you'll be on a high for the complete 41 minutes and 14 seconds of Cloud Nine (aptly-titled, as I said).  As &quot;Got My Mind Set On You&quot; fades out, it's hard to believe how fast the time went...not many albums have that effect.<BR>The big shame is that it is somewhat difficult to get a copy of for a decent price.  It desperately needs to be made more readily available because casual George Harrison fans (if there is such a thing) need to have this in their collecions--it shouldn't just be for us hardcore or &quot;completist&quot; fans.
B000001FS3|5.0|I don't think it can be overstated how great this disc is. Everything U2 had been building towards since their debut disc in 1980 (Boy) came to a head with The Joshua Tree. The sound, the production, the songwriting, the whole atmosphere, everything melded into a great album. There are very few albums that have such classic songs back to back to back.<BR>Where the Streets Have No Name is an average song, but really sounds great in concert. It was, however a hit and deservedly so, but it is not really the greatest song on the album. Those come next when the band levy a one-two punch with I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and With Or Without You. Like most great U2 songs, they feature a dark passionate vocal from Bono, with stark guitars from The Edge played over the solid grooves of bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. The hooks are amazing, and the composition is stellar. <BR>Next is the fan favorite Bullet the Blue Sky, with its 'Nicaraguan jetfighter guitars' provided by The Edge. Sonically, this song seems to hint at things to come on Achtung Baby.<BR>Running To Stand Still follows with its pensive introspection, highlighting the ultimate sadness of the lyrics, which are about a drug addict.<BR>In God's Country was a minor hit, and is a decent, catchy song.<BR>Other notable tracks are the bluesy, fun Trip Through Your Wires and the beautiful One Tree Hill.<BR>The only minor bumps in the road belong to the album's final two tracks, but even they are listenable.<BR>On the whole, you can't go wrong with this album. It certainly sums up everything U2 was about in the 1980's. A masterpiece.
6303921248|5.0|I have the 1940's version of Pride and Prejudice starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier:it's superficial, but still fun to watch.  I also have the A&amp;E version of this classic.  It's also enjoyable, but a little pretentious: Elizabeth is just too perfect! <BR>    The very best version of this classic is from the BBC.  The characters are just right, and it is as though the story can be magically brought to life over and over again on your screen. I'll never get tired of this Elizabeth or Mr. Darcy.
0316666343|5.0|I heard Alice Sebold talking about \\"The Lovely Bones\\" and her biographical work, \\"Lucky\\" on NPR. I was mesmerized by her interview, but thought that I wouldn't want to read a sad story about a child who is raped, murdered, and dismembered. I came across the page previews here on Amazon.com--and I was hooked. I ordered the book and was amazed at the depth of characters and the way she weaves the story about this dead little girl's family. Another reviewer commented about the lack of emotion in the narrator's tone--however, I feel that is important for the narrator to remain detatched. She is describing the network of family and friends, the \\"lovely bones\\", that make up the future of her life. The lovely bones are not, as one might think, HER bones, they refer to this framework that is formed by the people who are left behind.<br />In a truly simple and yet compelling way, Ms. Sebold paints a picture of the heartbreak of a father, the anger of the sister, the denial of the mother, and the confusion of the baby brother who just wants to know when Suzie is coming home? The baby brother continues to talk to Suzie--in the story, she doesn't know how, but he can sometimes see and hear her.<br />Alice Sebold describes heaven as a place where people can finish what they need to do before they move on to another place. The description of Suzie's heaven is very simple. Each day she spends there, she expands her reach--but only as she is ready. She is free to observe what happens on earth, or explore what is in her heaven. It is a simple idea, but Ms Sebold defines this heaven in a way that is quite lovely, and it was also quite comforting to me after the emotional description of happened to Suzie in the cornfield.<br />For those who might worry, the most wrenching part of the novel occurs at the beginning--and it is available for preview on Amazon.com If you read these preview pages, I believe that you, too, will want to read this compelling story. This is a book that I will pass on to my sister, mom, and all my girlfriends. It is a book about recovery and growth. God Bless.ass on to my sister, mom, and all my girlfriends. It is a book about recovery and growth. God Bless.
B000005GYI|5.0|I'm not the type of person to give 5 stars to a ton of albums...in fact, it's rare.  This is the best Nascimento album....the Brazillian answer to the Beatles White Album.  No, I'm not kidding. A wonderful place to start if you want to explore one of Brazil's most popular singer/songwriters.  Once this album captures you, follow it up with Geraes, Minas, Milagre Dos Peixes, Milton (1976), and Clube Da Esquina 2.
B00006C7G9|5.0|Gee, what more is there to say about this miniseries except that everyone must go out and buy it? Truly a phenomenon in TV production. Exciting, insightful, and terribly true, this tells the story of Easy Company, from their training to the end of the war. This is the ultimate supplement to those \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" fans, but more than that, it's a remarkable docudrama (though most of it is in movie form) that teaches about the reality of war in one of the most gut-wrenching and true-to-life ways. I'm sure it's been said before, but let me reiterate: this is the greatest TV miniseries of all time. Costing over $100 million, this is a film that movie lovers and collectors should not pass over. As stunning as \\"Shogun,\\" as exciting as \\"The Stand,\\" and as epic as \\"The Winds of War.\\"
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie is a very entertaining movie no matter what your age.  It is not too spooky for small children &amp; not to childish for adults.  It keeps up a good pace and holds your interest.
B000002H97|3.0|This was the last decent sounding Metallica I think. The 3 stars is for the RIDICULOUS ballad, Nothing Else Matters, except money these days for Metallica!. After this album they band all got identical haircuts (they all look like the same the Red Hot Chili Peppers have) and went Mainstream radio-friendly, faster than you could say Michael Jackson. Very depressing when you look back on the first three releases, the 1st Garage Days, and And Justice For All. If you don't have this and want to hear the last heavy hurrah from Metallica, it's worth the money. Just block your ears when Nothing Else Matters comes on, or program the track out completely. We can only pray they get their acts together and start playing the heaviness we know their capable of. They need to wipe the dollar signs out of their eyes, stop whining about whether or not some kid in Indiana (or anywhere) is downloading their music, get a decent bass player and put the Puppet sound back in their music. If not, they'll lose more fans than they have already.
B00005JL78|4.0|As I see it, the problem with many of the reviews of this movie is that they miss the ultimate point of \\"Minority Report.\\"  While it is an action/sci-fi movie, and it does feature lots of special effects and various ideas about the future, these are not really the point of the movie.  Nor is Cruise's decent performance as the wrongly accused protagonist.<br />As I see it, there are two issues this movie is trying to examine.  First, and somewhat obviously, \\"Minority Report\\" deals with the question of predestination.  Is our future set, with no ability to make real, free choices?  Even about something as important as whether or not we will commit murder?  As it should, \\"Minority Report\\" does not fully answer this question, but does a decent job of setting it forth in a way that it can be popularly understood and discussed.<br />Second, \\"Minority Report\\" tries to deal with a great moral problem: whether or not it is morally right to create a perfect society if it requires the sacrifice of an innocent, thereby relegating that innocent person to purely a means or tool for the establishment of this society?  While it is not set out in such a complicated way in \\"Minority Report,\\" it seems to me that Speilberg wanted to deal with this same issue.  Rather than killing the innocents, they are dehumanized and treated as objects (the precogs who predict the future).  The conclusions that Speilberg reaches in \\"Minority Report\\" are clearly applicable to this means-ends question, and are presented in the friendly, narrative style that Speilberg generally uses.<br />In any case, this is a truly thoughtful and thought-provoking movie that was sadly maligned by many caught up in the exciting chase scenes and strong special effects.  Most critics also apparently missed the point of the story, and so it did not receive the support it deserved.<br />This movie is not perfect, and not for everyone.  But for those interested in thinking about the future, or with a philosophical bent, there are things here worth seeing.things here worth seeing.
0671027344|4.0|The book \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" by Stephen Chbosky is about Charly, a young boy, who writes letters to an anonymous friend about his life, problems and thoughts.<br />We liked reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\". In our opinion it's easy to understand even if you don't know several words. The only problem we had was to remember all the things that happen because the story skips sometimes from one place to another.<BR>Stephen Chbosky found a good way to make the narrator's feelings accessible to the reader because it's written in diary style. Charly writes in colloquial speech and doesn't try to find the best words to express himself. He only writes what he feels. We think that everyone can put himself in Charlie's place in some situations although the story is too exaggerated because Charly combines nearly every problem young people may have and we can't believe that one person has all these problems.<BR>Most of the time we could understand his feelings but in our opinion his behaviour often is incomprehensible.  He does things we would never do. For example he admits his best friend to kiss him also he isn't in love with him.<BR>All in all we think it's a good book about the life of a young boy and you get to know Charly better than best friends because he talks about things that seem too intimate to talk about.
B0000508U6|5.0|This Cd has so many songs that just rock. All 10 are awsome. If you dont have this CD you should buy it. Yellow, Shiver, and Trouble are just simply the greatest. Like i said a MUST HAVE CD.
0783235666|5.0|I was very impressed with previous reviewer LividEmerald2's correct observation that &quot;the birds are a metaphor for the psychological conflict of Mitch's mother, who must cope with the idea of abandonment that would inevitably result from the relationship her son might forge with a woman.&quot;  This strikingly reminds me of the plot structure of Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot; with the genders reversed.  Of course this would not be the first sci-fi/horror allegory of &quot;The Tempest.&quot; We must not forget the psychological conflict of Professor Morbius in &quot;Forbidden Planet.&quot;
B00007BHOE|5.0|The one thing I love about this dvd is you can put in the second disk and edit your own slipknot show. And while editing, you can pick your favorite member's view and watch him in action through the whole song. I love watching Joey play drums. He is my favorite member because he rules on drums. Other than that, this dvd is funny but slipknot does know how to put on a good show. Stay (sic)!!
0920668372|5.0|...<br />If this is the most disturbing book you have ever read then I think you probably don't read much.  Ever heard of, or read, Steven King?<br />Perhaps a mother climbing into her grown sons window to rock him and tell him she loves him is a little far fetched but children have something called an imagination, something you lack.  I only wish that my mother could do that when I really need her to be close to me.<br />This is the best book I have ever read...  in fact I still read it to my sons today and they are 17 and 13 years old.  We not only get a kick out of it but we laugh and share old times about when they were babies.<br />PS  My parents are close, personal friends with Robert Munsch and he took time out of his busy schedule to meet with my sons during our family vacation and he is the kindest most gentle of people...   there are much worse things in the world than reading your children this book.
0099413140|5.0|It is very clever.  Adults liked it and kids will love it -- how could they not like a story about underwear?!?!  Cute illustrations.  A must have for those who want to bring a little \\"culture\\" into their child's life.
B00007KWI9|5.0|...When I heard Rhino was re-releasing the Yes catalogue on CD with additional tracks, I was a bit skeptical as the albums YES throuh DRAMA were already available in multiple CD releases.  Nevertheless, I went ahead and purchased YES today.<BR>All I can say is WOW.  The sound quality is absolutely STUNNING!!!  I've been listening to this classic, overlooked debut for many years and this is the single best version I've heard.  On \\"I See You\\" and \\"Every Little Thing\\", Bill Bruford sounds like he's playing drums in your living room.  I hear an additional depth and texturing on this version that I've never heard before, particularly in Jon Anderson/Chris Squire's harmony vocals. ALL tracks sound more powerful and clearer than the original CD (which was a rather dismal analog transfer) as well as the 1995 Atlantic remaster.<BR>I already had most of the extra tracks in bootleg version, but to hear them polished up is indeed an extra treat.  The original LP artwork is fully restored, there is an excellent essay and a full lyric sheet.  <BR>This is a very nice treatment of an important album in Yes' development.  This is NOT CLOSE TO THE EDGE or TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS Yes, but still provides a worthy listen as the band develops its chops.  Highly recommended, and I look forward to picking up the next round of remasters soon.  If Rhino gives CLOSE TO THE EDGE this kind of treatment, it will be musical nirvana.
B00005JLWL|5.0|I, for one, can't wait until this comes out on DVD--that is, if the film's producers correct the mistakes made during the theatrical run, and actually *promote* a home video release.<br />An extraordinary film that was effectively buried in a limited release of ~300 screens with zero advertising, this movie proved that excellent action, smart writing and tight direction can definitely be fused effectively on a small budget.  I can't think of the last time were I felt so fully immersed in the action on screen, or vested myself in the characters so completely.  The cast was top notch; Christian Bale and Emily Watson shone in the lead, and Sean Bean providing the maximum amount of quality work with a minimum of screen time.<br />Often labeled \\"derivative\\" in its reviews, \\"Equilibrium\\" was definitely not a critical favorite; however, most of the criticisms aimed at it were unjust, as the film took a number of disparate influences (American westerns, Huxley, Orwell, The Matrix (itself derived from every HK wire-fu flick since the early 70's), and so on) and reinvented them, imbuing them with a signature that was clearly its own.  This is an excellent moviegoing experience, and I recommend it to all.
B0000020C4|5.0|i`ve been listening to all 3 recodings - the london - american and this one-- this is the best--best recorded best voices and best acting-- with all due respect to patti lupone--  her version of i dreamed a dream for example-- its a bit like arent i wonderful ! a little ego there-- whereas this version its all submerged into the character-- no pretense no grandstanding -- ruthie henshall inhabits the role and delivers !!lets face it- the brits have been practicing the theatre arts hundreds of years longer than we have- and it shows---- the average brit actor can act circles around american counterparts-- generally speaking-- here- for sure ! this game cast delivers perfection to these ears----theres more here humor and professionalism throughout-- this is the definitive version for me-- i cant stop listening to it !!
0060278250|4.0|Of course, if you are considering reading this book, you adored the first two set in Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom as much as I did. This book concludes the adventure that begins in Lirael and includes many of the characters that first appear in Sabriel.<br />The plot is tight, the characters are consistent, but this book is 100 pages shorter than Lirael and it feels it. Although the author may have streamlined the story to add a sense of urgency to the plot, instead it feels just a tad under-edited. I would have preferred to slow down and savor this most recent book. <br />In part what is missing is some of the visual detail which adds both mood and believable texture to the Old Kingdom. Another element that of necessity is missing, is the turmoil that Sam and Lireal both feel in trying to discover their own path in life. Here they have come to recognize and use their skills effectively. (If that sounds a little dry - I am writing performance evaluations at the office right now.) <br />Stylistically, I almost think that Lirael and Abhorsen were originally written as one 900 page book which would make the pacing more sensible.<br />I am still a bit disappointed that after introducing the characters in Sabriel, the next book skips ahead 20 years. I hope that the fourth book in this universe (and there had better BE a fourth book even if ultimate evil has already been vanquished) continues to feature the characters introduced in Lirael and Abhorsen.
B0000027K7|5.0|Starting with the chart topping &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot;, Mountain gained temporary monumental success!  The song was so good, radio executives ignored the torrid lyrics.  With nothing short of incredible lead and acoustic guitar playing, Leslie West shines on this collection with some of the most innovative guitar work of the period.  Corky Lang's drums rivaled that of Jack Bruce of the time and Felix Pappalardi's vocals could be smoothly romantic &quot;Theme From An Imaginary Western&quot; or wild, as in, &quot;Never In My Life&quot;.  &quot;For Yasgur's Farm&quot; is a wonderful tribute to Woodstock, while &quot;To My Friend&quot; is an amazing solo work of acoustic picking.  &quot;Boys In The Band&quot; is a grand finale to an all too short album that defined a period of rock and roll without overshadowing it.  A must for any true rock fan.
0060005424|5.0|Other reviews have already covered this wonderful fantasy book very well. I would like to recommend it especially to librarians for a fun busman's holiday.<br />Lirael, when her psychic skills appear to be slow in developing, becomes a Third Assistant Librarian. In an almost Terry Pratchett like moment, she is taken to the \\"Robing Room, a huge room full of all the equipment, weapons, and miscellaneous items the librarians needed, from climbing ropes to boathooks.\\"<br />After some rather challenging experiences in the stacks, she does go on to further adventures in the outside world, but by then you will be hooked.
B00006H67M|5.0|I can remember as a kid going through my father's old records and finding this album. This CD brings back so many memories of my first introduction to Jazz as a child. My Father and I played this album to death. I still have the album, but it is so scratched up it is unplayable. I thought that this music was the most beautiful music in the world. I loved the calming effect it gave you. It made you feel as if you were really on an island in the carribean or Tahiti as one of the songs is so aptly named. Get this CD if you love jazz with a carribean feel, and want a want mood setting music.
0316666343|1.0|I will begin by saying that I had no interest in reading this novel, but a friend lent me a copy and suggested that I give it a chance.  I was very disappointed that I did not follow my initial inclination.  In general, I find that much contemporary fiction is rushed and lacking in genuine character development, and I found Ms. Sebold's novel to be no exception.  The descriptions of heaven were annoying as hell (pun intended), and I particularly disliked the scene where she comes back to earth to have sex.  In short, the book reads very much like a teen novel that wasn't allowed to be a teen novel because it was too graphic.  Nonetheless, it would have been happier as a teen novel, and I would have been happier with it as a teen novel as well as I never would have been induced to give it a read.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; works on just about all levels.  Ron Howard deserved the recognition he received for it, but the whole thing would have fallen apart if the lead actor had been miscast.  No such problem here.<br />Russell Crowe gives a simply fantastic portrayal of John Nash.  The gestures and speech patterns ring true and would be praise-worthy in their own rite, but compared with his Academy Award-winning turn in &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000) show the staggering range of this gifted actor.  Nothing against Denzel Washington (also an actor of considerable talent), but I would have voted for Mr. Crowe in the Best Actor category for the 2001 Oscars.<br />In case anyone has not seen this film yet, I'll not give away its secrets (it has a couple that rival the one in &quot;The Crying Game&quot;), but I cannot recommend this film highly enough.  Ron Howard, a truly formidable director, has made the film of his career that is both moving and thought-provoking. <br />Get this DVD.  This is one to treasure.
B0000060NH|5.0|If there's any testament to the talent of Marvin Gaye, it's this album. Written and Produced by the man himself, it's one of the best movie scores of it's time.. It's reputation has undecidedly surpassed that of the movie, which I haven't seen, but has been described as one of the more forgettable blaxploitation films of the time. <br />The cool jazz-funk orchestration is full and tight throughout (unlike many movie scores) and never leaves the listener bored... Despite that, there's a definite dark, almost desperate mood all throughout this album. This is also a primary example of the way Marvin used his voice akin to an instrument rather than letting his vocals dominate the arrangement. It works very well with the mood on this album.<br />Overall, a captivating listening experience..
0375410341|4.0|4.5 Stars.<br />Let me start out by saying that I do not consider myself some intellectual, post-modernist genious or anything like that.  I am just a normal person, who enjoys reading (I mainly read fantasy and Clive Barker novels).<br />When I first saw this book I was intrigued by the layout of the novel...the use of the color blue for house, the pages with upside down writting, the footnotes, etc.  That however was also the same reason I decided not to purchase it.  I thought that it would be just a little too much for me; that author of this book obvisouly had an agenda and for the first time I questioned my ability to grasp the material...would it be too much for me. <br />After talking to other people who read the book and hearing their glowing recounts of it, I finally picked it up and began reading.  <br />I think it took me almost a month to go through this book.  And I have to agree with the other reviewer(s) who said that this reading pace was not decided by me, but by the author.  There is no question about it, this author was manipulating me.<br />I loved everything about this book.  I can't even begin to describe the impact it had on me.  I was obsessed over it.  I told everyone I could about it.  <br />Mark Danielewski narrative style is beyond brilliant.  Johnny's passages bordered on poetic.  <br />I loved the manipulations done to the text and the layout, it helped drive home the idea that I was being lead around and maniupulated by the author (I have never had that samed feeling from reading any other book).  <br />I almost wish I had a doctoral degree in modern literature or something so I could right a proper review of this novel.
B00005R62K|5.0|This album is so great! It is hands down, the heaviest album from Priest's 70's era, and is also bar none, one of their finest moments.<br />The album opens with a rampaging blast of sonic fury, in the form of \\"Exciter\\". This song is one of the reasons why Priest is often cited as a key ingredient in the creation of thrash. Drummer Les Binks shows off his double bass drum and his nice sense of rhythm, while Rob wails and screams like something out of hell. Tipton and Downing show off their supierior riffing and dual harmonies in this song as well. One of my faves off the album.<br />\\"White Heat, Red Hot\\" starts off rather mid-paced and then speeds up in places. The end of the song has a great rhythm!<br />\\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" is the infamous track off the album. ...<br />The title track to Stained Class is killer! Not as fast as \\"Exciter\\", but still has a speedy pace to it. Great lyrics, nice riffing, good solos, this is one of the highlights.<br />\\"Invader\\" is another somewhat mid-paced number, and it's awfully catchy! Good song.<br />\\"Saints In Hell\\" is a dirty, raw, dark and heavy song, that's stays at a slow pace for most of the song, then speeds up towards the end. ...<br />\\"Savage\\" is One of my favorites off the album. This song sort of reminds me of the song \\"Dissident Aggressor\\" from Priest's \\"Sin After Sin\\" album, for some reason. It's a slow paced song stuffed with meaty riffage, steady drumming, great vocals (duh!) and a good melody throughout, especially towards the end.<br />\\"Beyond The Realms Of Death\\" is the closest thing to a ballad on this album, though it is pretty rocking. It starts off sounding sort of like a ballad, then unleases a burst of energy, back to the balladry, burst of energy, back to ballad, finally,back to rocker and never looks back. Awesome melodies, great lyrics, GREAT performance by Rob, this is just a classic.<br />\\"Heroes End\\" has Kick ... Sabbath-like melody in this song! This is yet another song about death, this time addressing the subject of how celebrities seem to gain god-like fame after death that they would never gain living. A fine end to a fine album.<br />This album rips, plain and simple. This is metal in it's purest form, and it's stuffed silly with riffs, wails and good drumming. This is a metal album for metal fans...if you are into traditioanal metal or even thrash, this is a must have. Pure classic.time addressing the subject of how celebrities seem to gain god-like fame after death that they would never gain living.

B00005QY5Y|5.0|&quot;Gold&quot; is a masterpiece. Usually when I buy cd's it is for two or three songs that I've heard on the radio that I enjoyed. Sometimes there are a couple more surprises that I discover later, but for the most part the rest of the songs seem like filler. &quot;Gold&quot; is like a &quot;best of&quot; compilation that I would have created for myself of all my favorite Ryan Adams  songs. Every song on the disk is great. &quot;New York, New York&quot; of course is a mainstream hit. &quot;Answering Bell&quot; has a great country-rock sound. My favorites though are the ballads &quot;Goodnight Hollywood Boullevard&quot;, &quot;Wild Flowers&quot;, and &quot;The Bar is a Beautiful Place&quot; (bonus track on 2nd disk). They are among the best songs I've ever heard. &quot;When the Stars Go Blue&quot; is also really popular right now with the Corrs and Bono having recently done a cover of it. This is a must have for anyone who likes music with an emphasis on accoustic guitar and deep lyrics. I went out and purchased &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, &quot;Demolition&quot;, and the Whiskeytown album &quot;Faithless Street&quot;, all of which are very good too. &quot;Gold&quot; is the way to go for anyone trying Ryan Adams for the first time. You will not be disappointed.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|8 Mile is the best hip-hop soundtrack since Murder Was The Case. I like every track Eminem and 50 Cent are on. I also like the tracks by Xzibit, Boomkat, Rakim, D-12, and Obie Trice. I expected more from Jay-Z and Nas, but they did okay. I think the Shady/Aftermath sampler is good too. I listen to \\"Stimulate\\" by Eminem and \\"Rap Name\\" by Obie Trice on a regular basis. 50 Cent's freestyle over the \\"Til I Collapse\\" beat is also tight. My favorite songs on the soundtrack are \\"Rabbit Run\\", \\"Lose Yourself\\", and \\"Love Me\\". I feel where Benzino is coming from, but this white boy has skills. No one can deny that. The movie was just as good as the soundtrack.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|It's amazing what a song can do. These Russian girls who recorded a Russian album in 2001 has suddenly found fame outside their country with the help of famed producer Trevor Horn. While they saw good single sales of their current single All The Things She Said, radio only took to it seriously now. The song climbs into the Top 40 this week on Billboard Hot 100 and it's indeed rare for an artist from Russia.<br /><br />Supposedly lesbian, the girls appear smooching and making out in their debut English single, the effect is really more coy than steamy. The girls sing with such girlish charm that the chorus of the song repeats itself incessantly in your head. All The Things She Said is really a slight rock song with a delicious chorus. The next song to watch out is the very Underworld-ish sounding Not Gonna Get Us which is accomapanied with a Thelma and Louise-style music video with the girls on a wild joyride crashing into people and things. Spectacular visually and aurally. Thumbs up for this.<br /><br />Elsewhere on the album, you find mostly sweet forgettable pop songs and a weird remake of the classic Smith's single How Fast Is Soon? The girls make disposable pop and the album does not shine too brightly after the first two cuts on the album. Still, this is one step up for Russian pop I guess.
1881273156|5.0|My husband and I read this book together before we decided to marry and it completely set the stage for our marriage.  He's an Acts of Service kind of guy, and I'm a Quality Time.  Before we read this he was constantly doing all kinds of nice things for me while I sat and waited for him to stop with all the 'doing' and just spend time with me!  Now that we understand how the other person understands love we are able to demonstrate it in a way that's meaningful.  Not only that, but now when he does do nice things for me I'm beginning to understand that he's showing me how much he loves me.  Over time we not only know how the other person understands love, but we're learning each other's language so that it becomes our 'secondary language'.  <br />This book will bring your communication and understanding of each other to a whole new level!  I don't know where we would be if we hadn't read it!
630018160X|5.0|I am sure that some folks might know this, but there were two endings filmed to this musical.  The one we see on TV or in the video is the sad version, but there was also the up beat version.  Right after Charity is gilted, Oscar returns to his apartment- only to find out that his clostrophoebia (spelling?) is coming back.   He leaves his apartment for air, when he comes across Charity standing in front of the bridge, where, Charley, her former boyfriend dumped her into the river in the beginning of the film.  Oscar assumes that Charity is going to jump, so he runs to stop her, but trips on her bag instead and dumps her into the river anyway.  Hence, an arc was drawn here from the beginning of the film.. No matter, Oscar jumps in as well, and confesses that he would suffocate without her, and wants her back.  They both get out of the river, and as they start to walk away, Charity looks up, and &quot;Thanks God&quot;, which gives another meaning to the final title, &quot;...And she lived hopefully ever after&quot;.  <BR>   Cute, but trite-- after all this drama, I am sure that the audience would have felt cheated if it ended this lightly.  Hence the ending that we see now was chosen over this.  This ending was in the Laser DISC version, which has gone long out of print.  Let us hope that this will be in the DVD edition as well.
B000002HPT|5.0|I don't see why everybody is so negative about this album. There's no way I'll sit here and try and list all my favorite albums from DT, because it's way too hard. However, Scenes from a Memory is my favorite. I don't understand all these people writing \\"This cd is OK, but not as good as Images and Words!!\\" ...Or whatever cd they think is the best. <br />Dream Theater has a very versatile sound, as any fan knows. They can make so many different kinds of songs, from heavy, like \\"The Mirror\\" or \\"The Glass Prison,\\" They have soft songs like \\"The Spirit Carries On,\\" \\"Hollow Years,\\" and \\"Silent Man.\\" And just about everything else thrown in the middle. I, as well as many other fans, like to hear all these styles of music that DT play in. This album stands out from the best, it's probably the most notably different, but it's not bad at ALL! I'm disappointed in fans that give the cd bad ratings because it's not as heavy as they'd like to be, or it's missing something. The bottom line is that this is another great album from DT.
B00005CDNI|4.0|VOULEZ-VOUS is a strange album in that the singles released (including: \\"Chiquitita,\\" \\"I Have a Dream,\\" and \\"Does Your Mother Know\\") are some of the worst songs on the album. Regardless of how I personally feel about \\"Chiquitita\\" and \\"I Have a Dream,\\" those songs stick out like a sore thumb on this up-beat disco album. The real masterpieces of VOULEZ-VOUS are the album cuts most people have never heard of. <br />Most notably \\"If It Wasn't for the Nights,\\" my second favorite ABBA song right behind \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You.\\" Other highlights include \\"Angeleyes,\\" \\"King Has Lost His Crown,\\" and \\"Kisses of Fire\\" - all of these with a heavy dose of disco flair. <br />ABBA has never been more funky and, with the exception of \\"Chiquitita\\" and \\"I Have a Dream,\\" less cheesy.

B000000WCA|3.0|Back when I was in 5th and 6th grade I used to love this album, as well as the Spice Girls. Now, I am a little older and don't care for this type of music as much. But, still I give this disc an occasional spin. When I do, the first 3 tracks remind me why I found this album so appealing. First off, 'Wannabe' is a fun, uptempo number, while the ballad 'When Two Become One' is an ultimate guilty pleasure. The both catchy and sexy 'Say You'll Be There' is easily the greatest song on the album equaling the work of any pop artist of the last 20 years, including more respected ones like Madonna. Unfortunately, the rest of this CD is quite forgetable. Still, I'm sure any fan of the Spice Girls or of pop music will find it enjoyable. 'Wannabe', 'When Two Become One', and 'Say You'll Be There' are all classic pop songs and make this one of the best pop albums of the 90's.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|After seeing Sade several years ago at the Ralston in Atlanta, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this live set! That show was so hot that I knew why they call the city &quot;Hotlanta&quot;! Once I got this disk home I was not at all disappointed. From &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; to &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot;, Sade delivers to her audience again and again. I was a little diappointed to see that &quot;World Ethnic Minority&quot;, her obscure songwriting collaboration with the late Picole Train, was not included here, but that is a minor gripe. This set of songs is so hot that I when I play it I worry if the fire sprinklers in my apartment will go off as they sometimes do!
B000002NC4|5.0|Bought this cd 5 years ago and I sold it for some reason even though I listened to it often, and I didn't really need the money.  Then during the napster years, downloaded the same songs on this album, listened to it often, then lost the mp3s.  Then I bought this cd again.  It won't leave me.  If you throw it away and it keeps coming back, then its gold, right?  THis is pure gold.  Amazing music that will define you and make you true.  The music builds and grows and you end up doing the same.  Every song is good rock.  I havn't heard any other BTS cds.  I don't need to.  I don't want to be disapointed because no band can top this. This is rock.
0553582445|5.0|Fool's Errand is the first novel in the Tawny Man trilogy.  It continues the storyline described in the The Farseer and The Liveship Traders trilogies.  In The Farseer trilogy, FitzChivalry Farseer, the Assassin's Assistant, has literally risen from the grave and disappeared with his wolf, Nighteyes, from the Six Duchies.  Only Starling Birdsong, the Queen's Minstel, knows who and where he is.    In this novel, FitzChivalry is known as Tom Badgerlock and is living with his adopted son, Hap, when his past life calls upon him in the form of Chade Fallstar, the Royal Assassin.  His old mentor comes with news of family and friends and a request that Fitz return to Buckkeep Castle to tutor Prince Dutiful in the Skill.  Fitz declines and and Chade returns to Buckkeep the following day.     In the following months, Starling and Jinna the hedgewitch visit him and even the Fool returns for a while;  the White Prophet and his Catalyst together again.  After many days of exchanging the news, the Fool leaves and, some days later, Hap returns from working the harvests, disappointed in the life of a laborer.  Then, a message comes from Chade urgently requesting that Fitz come to him in Buckkeep.  Wanting to go to Buckkeep anyway to arrange an apprenticeship for Hap, Fitz and Hap travel with Nighteyes to the Castle.      In Buckkeep town, Fitz finds the Fool, posing as Lord Golden, waiting to guide him to Chade, who informs him that Prince Dutiful has disappeared.  While there is no evidence of foul play, Dutiful may have been lured away and kidnapped by the Piebalds, a group that uses exposure of their fellow Witted to gain power, for someone has sent a note claiming that Dutiful is Witted.  Chade arranges an apprenticeship for Hap and Fitz and the Fool go looking for kidnappers.    This new trilogy promises to take us even further into the backstory of the Six Duchies, especially in the nature of the Skill, Witted and other powers.    Recommended for Hobb fans and anyone who enjoys tales of mystery and talent in a fantasy setting.    -Arthur W. Jordin
B00006LLNU|3.0|I purchased and listened to this CD with high expectations and was somewhat disappointed.  The music is somewhere between ambient and Pink Floydian and is not without merit, but the tortureously repetitive vocalized verse that repeats through THE ENTIRE CD, is excruciating to listen to.  I am not a stranger to the ambient genre and realize that repetiveness can lend itself to the trance which can be entirely pleasurable, but in this CDs case, the single repetitive vocalized line over and over again is overwhelming.  I would recommend passing on this CD but this does not come easy for me to say because I wanted to like it and do certainly like the music but taken as a whole, well, sorry folks.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|ATDI should not even begin to compare to Nirvana or Rage Against the Machine. ATDI was in before all of those terrible useless bands and ATDI kept rocking until they broke up. This CD (their last as a band) is their best work ever. It rocks the entire CD. No band can even dream of rocking as hard as ATDI....
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I'll have to say that this is a difficult album to review for a few reasons; one of them being that they do not right their own songs, and, when one looks into it further, are rather heavily controlled by their management/company...but nevertheless...this is fine, high quality music with a message that, whether they are fully lesbian or not, transmits the actual message that they do love each other. Critics aside!:-)<br />The album starts off with the beautiful pounding electronica of \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\", one of the hit songs from the album, and a great one at that, with descriptive, meaningful lyrics.<BR>\\"All The Things She Said\\", is a beautiful rockish tribute to the constraints of society upon certain kinds of relationships.<BR>\\"Show Me Love\\" is another single from the album and when you hear it, and read the lyrics (which is another good this about this album that the songs have meaningful lyrics), you'll be amazed! \\"30 Minutes\\" is a thoughtful interlude-ish ballad, and fits perfectly and contemplatively into the framework of the short album...it has been a single in some countries. \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" is a genius cover of an 80s song...it's very dreamlike..\\"Clouns (Can You See Me Now?) is a very techno track filled with desperation...(the russian version is better, though), as with the next track \\"Malchik Gay\\", which is on the interesting subject of a girl wishing a boy weren't gay so he'd fall in love with her:>...The last real song \\"Stars\\" is a great way to close the main album...filled with ambience...exoticness...and yes, russian raps!:-)<BR>I think the songs are great when translated from the russian, tho alot of the russian versions are better...<br />Many of the songs on this album can be like an anthem for anyone. Reccomended!
B000069CWE|5.0|AWESOME! one of the best ever cd's, if not the best. I borrowed this from a friend as we went down the highway for a school frield trip, with music and bass blarin. All the touches have been put on it perfectly. It's not just some [sappy]old remix. Throw eminem and JC out the window, Linkin Park all the way! You absoultely love it!
B00007H1Y2|5.0|An absolute delight from beginning to end.   It feels like a soundtrack to a dozen short movies -- all unfolding in some otherworldy place that evixts between past and present.     The musicianship is playful, sensual and precise, and the whole album feels alive with rhythmic and romantic joy.  Highlights include \\"Monte a Dentro,\\" \\"Patricia,\\" \\"Secret Love,\\" and the title track.  Certainly to be one the best of 2003,  and perhaps even the unexpected pop success of the year.  Discover it now, before it's played to death.
B000002GW5|5.0|Until Running on Empty, Jackson headlined in mid level arenas.  For the Running on Empty Tour, with a tremendous assist from his opening act Karla Bonoff, Browne moved into the big sports arenas playing to 20000 a night.   Running on Empty was his highlight from a financial standpoint. <br />An interesting concept at the time and some of the songs, like Running on Empty and the Load Out/Stay became big hits.  Load Out/Stay is the mandatory end to a Jackson Browne concert, as it was when Bruce Springsteen and the E street band performed the song along with Jackson at the No Nukes concert in 1980.<br />You Love the Thunder, with Rosemary Butler as a tremendous backup voice, is a good song and Rosie, despite its unique subject matter, is a decent song that gets a lot of airtime still. <br />I could probably do without the song about big 18 wheelers but it fit the concept. <br />The album is only not great when compared to other Jackson Brown albums.  Late for The Sky, Pretender and For Everyman are masterpieces and Running on Empty is a notch below that.  I think the hard core Jackson Browne fan was glad when the Running on Empty frenzy died down and you could see Jackson in a concert hall, where he belongs. <br />Don McNay...
1573229725|5.0|Set in Victorian England, FINGERSMITH tells the tale of the intertwined lives of Sue and Maud and their involvement in a scheme to get their hands on a large inheritance. To tell any more of the plot would possibly risk giving away some delicious tidbit. The reader should begin FINGERSMITH knowing as little as possible to enable them to fully appreciate all the twists and turns that are involved. Once one thinks they've figured it out they are once again left in the dark. Not until the last paragraph does one come upon the ending.<br />There is so much enjoyment to be found in FINGERSMITH. The writing is beautiful and enchanting. There were so many scenes where I could really 'feel' what it would be like to live during this time period. I most appreciated Waters' portrayal of the mad house before the advent of modern psychiatric knowledge and care. What a grim and desolate place to find yourself in. I have not enjoyed a work of historical fiction as much as FINGERSMITH since I read Margaret Atwood's ALIAS GRACE, which is equally impressive. FINGERSMITH is well worth reserving time during the day to indulge yourself.
B000066NW0|5.0|I thought this CD was great for her first one. Unlike what some people say, these songs aren't the normal, repetitive style songs you hear on the radio everyday. This CD is definately worth your money. The only downside is that she is a bit too into the bad girl/punk idea. But thats not for me to judge. If you want to hear music from someone who is not your sterotyped signer, listen to &quot;Let Go.&quot;
B00005V3Z4|5.0|As most people, I also missed seeing Donnie Darko on the theaters and just happen to stumble across it once it was out on DVD.<br />Wow!!! is really a shame this movie was not marketed properly since is a very insightful and intriguing film covering a range of genres like drama, science fiction, horror and even a teen.<br />The film deals with Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhall) receiving a warning from a giant rabbit named Frank about the end of the world (this is just a simple jest of the movie). The acting is superb with excellent turns by Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayse, Maggie Gyllenhall, Katherine Ross, Jenna Malone and Mary McDonell. The music in the film is outstanding since it conveys the feelings and message of the characters.<br />The bonus materials of the DVD is excellent. The disc includes deleted scenes, director commentary, trailer, tv spots.<br />A must see!!!
B000002J6H|5.0|Aside from being one of the 10 standards for '70's music, his collaborations with Hendrix and Clapton are now treasures in themselves. I last saw CS&amp;N at Irvine Meadows in 1987 and they played for about 4 hours as the crowd overflowed the parking lot, the access road, and parked on the shoulder of I-5 for 3 miles in each direction. Out of respect for their audience - some whom arrived over an hour late - they played the last 2 hours free. In addition to tremendous talent, Stills and CSN have class. Please change your review, you embarrass yourselves.
B00005RRG9|5.0|Now this is the way a classic should be treated. Disney pulled out all the stops for the DVD's in their new \\"Vault Disney Collection\\" which has 4 different releases as of 1/29/03. I have always loved this movie, and you can read all the great things about the film itself from other reviewers and from the VHS reviews. First and most importantly it's WIDESCREEN. I think all DVD's should be.  But the EXTRAS!! WOW, they put it all in here.<br /><br />The 2 disc set has much more than is listed here or on the packaging. It is loaded with surprise features, but you have to hunt for them.<br />A featurette \\"Disney Legend Hayley Mills\\"; Featurette on the double used for behind the back shots called \\"Who's the Twin\\"  with a recent interview from her; \\"Seeing Double\\" is a mini-documentary about the process used to make it appear to be 2 girls when there were one in may shots; A great interview feature with recently deceased animator Ward Kimball, and director David Swift; About 17 minutes from a classic Disney TV episode from 1961 \\"The Titlemakers\\", featuring work on the films title shots and music; several archive galleries with studio fan cards, costume design sketches, lobby cards, invitations, film production letterhead,  posters, magazine ads, screenplay, and the complete exhibitors campaign book;  audio features with production photos such as a Radio Spot from the original release, two songs, and 2 interactive \\"Sound Studio\\" demonstrations. There is a touching feature on the songwriting team, the Sherman Brothers, responsible for many of the memorable songs from movie history including Mary Poppins, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, and the non-Disney \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\". More features include \\"Lets Get Together\\"; Another behind the scenes documentary with tons of modern interviews of the stars and film-makers called \\"Caught in the Act, the Making of the Parent Trap\\". Also more production archives; and the 1961 Disney Studio album which is a video showcasing all the Disney created in 1961 from Parks, to TV, to theater; Also included is the original theatrical cartoon released with the film.<br /><br />To find all of these is not easy, so make sure you poke around and push on every icon you can and play the things that do not sound intersting since they can lead to another menu of goodies.<br /><br />Thank you! Thank you, whoever at Disney pushed to treat this DVD like this. The extras have caused me to rave about the Vault Disney series to everyone I know and buy extra copies for my loved ones as Christmas presents. I hope all Disney fans buy tons of these so Disney understands it is worth putting the extra work into a DVD. On the other hand I and my friends have refused to buy some of the Disney discs they have rushed to the market lately with no extras and no Widescreen.

B000002GYW|5.0|This, the second Eagles studio album, was quite influential in its day.  Concept albums had been around a while, from Frank Zappa's \\"Freak Out\\", through the Beatles \\"Seargent Peppers\\" and onto Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side\\".  But, as good as those were, none painted the canvas in subtle earth tones as did Desperado.  One could listen to each tune independently and never expect the synergy they possesed as a whole.  This one needs to be absorbed as a complete entity, non stop.  For that investment in time, one is transplanted back to life in the old west, complete with its hardships as well as its good times, and from its crystaline sunrises to its dusty trails.  Pure classic.
0060090367|3.0|I thought this book was just ok.... While I do think Marian Keyes is a funny &amp; entertaining writer, I did find some parts of the book to be so long-winded that they became unbearable. It is a very quick &amp; easy read.

B00004YTZE|5.0|The only studio album of Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers. The production is somewhat rough, but finally that also is a charm of this music. All songs are great. Especially I would like to mention Pirate Love\\", Can't Keep My Eyes On You\\", Chinese Rocks\\", It's Not Enough\\" and of course Born To Lose\\". Highly recommendable is also the corresponding live album Live At Max's Kansas City\\".
B000002KXV|5.0|I had always thought that Steely Dan were the most cynical musical [group] the world had ever known, and had always loved them for it. So who knew that Donald Fagen's first outing after the \\"breakup\\" of Steely Dan would be so warm hearted? Fagen takes a nostalgic look back at his years growing up, listening to jazz, and wishing for the amazing world of science to make the world a better place. All the while, the music maintains the high quality jazz pop hybridizing that Steely Dan fans were expecting from him.<br />There's more affection on \\"The Nightfly's\\" eight songs than Steely Dan put into their entire library. \\"I.G.Y. (What A Beautiful World)\\" has such a bright outlook that you have to remind yourself that this is the man who once sang about a nuclear future with the words \\"assassins, cons and rapers, might as well die.\\" There's longing for the first love in \\"Maxine\\" and a telling remake of Dion and The Belmonts' \\"Ruby Baby\\" to show that, despite the ennui and world-weary tone that Steely Dan often took, Donald Fagen was more of a romantic than we ever suspected.<br />\\"The Nightfly\\" even sports a very un-Dannish sense of humor. Witness the casual dismissal ot the titlar lovesick DJ's crank caller...<BR>\\"You say there's a race of men in the trees? <BR>You're for tough legislation.<BR>Thanks for calling.<BR>I wait all night for calls like these.\\"<BR>...before he launches into a plea for his old love to come back.<br />Had this been the album after \\"Aja\\" and not after \\"Gaucho,\\" Steely Dan would have ended with a bang instead of the whimper. And since this was the start of a near 20 year writer's block for Fagen, it gives us all the more reason to love the night (fly) life.
B000000W5H|5.0|My favorite studio album of the Stones. The album is made of one stroke. There is not one song that is inferior or that disturbs. I can listen to it with pleasure again and again. The texts may not move the world, but the music is all the more alright. My favorite songs are If You Can't Rock Me\\", It's Only Rock'n'Roll\\", Time Waits For No One\\", Luxury\\" and Dance Little Sister\\".
B000002L42|2.0|Given that Steely Dan was primarily a studio creation of reclusive geniuses Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, did anyone honestly expect a live Steely Dan to gain anything on stage? This &quot;live&quot; record is sterile and lifeless, the arrangements differ so imperceptably from their album counterparts, that this record becomes cynical by its very exisitence. The studio versions of everything on &quot;Alive in America&quot; outshine this disc's surpirsing sterile performances, making this one for the diehards only.
B0000033WC|5.0|Fourth and last studio album of the Velvet Underground. This one is not as much provocative as the previous studio albums, and therefore is seen as more commercial. But that doesn't mean worse in any way. Some of the songs have become classics which reappear in a variety of versions in the live work of Lou Reed, especially Sweet Jane&quot;, Rock &amp; Roll&quot; and New Age&quot;, which are also the ones that I like the most. This edition contains to each original song also a demo version. It is very enthralling to watch how these songs have been evolved.
B00004YX39|4.0|This album took such an unjust drubbing that's interseting to listen to it now, over 20 years later and remastered. Steely Dan did release a masterwork just before \\"Gaucho,\\" and unrealistic expectations had certainly been laid out. That isn't Becker or Fagen's fault. There isn't a song here that would be out of place on other Steely Dan records, and some of the musical choices are truly inspired (such as plucking then spanking new guitar hero Mark Knopfler to play on \\"Time Out Of Mind\\").<br />But the times they were a'changin', so in a world where Joe Jackson, Elvis Costello and the Cars were making energetic pop for the radio and rebellious fun palatable to the masses, Steely Dan were seen as an anachronism at best, and washed-out indulegent has beens at worst. \\"Gaucho\\" was, at the time, a little too polished, a little too overtly thought out, and in an period when anarchy was turning into a party cry for frat brats, far too precise in structure.<br />Time has given \\"Gaucho\\" a much fairer shake. The arrangements hold the Dan's flair for pazz-jop right in place, and the ennui that shimmers through the title song and even the deceptively perky hit \\"Hey Nineteen\\" are trademark Steely Dan. Given the amount of pressure that was on them to produce another milestone, \\"Gaucho\\" satisfies in the fact that it wasn't an over acheiver of a record. Just a modest one.
B00003CXXM|1.0|I would have fallen a sleep but was on a date.<BR>weak plot, stale, dragged on.<BR>Matt Damon  better read the script before doing a movie.
B00000JAQ8|5.0|..Nightwish is my favorite band. This is Nightwish's best album..Tarja's voice is so beautiful!!Best songs of the album are Gethsemane, Walking in the air, sleeping sun &amp; Stargazers...<BR>Nightwishe's latest album, Century Child is also very good!
B000002KAT|5.0|To those who prefer 'Moondance', I admit it has greater musical structure and the radio popular hits.  This album has thematic spontaneity.<br />Powerful Soul in this R&amp;B gem.
B00005JL78|4.0|Stephen Spielberg's latest sci-fi/action film \\"Minority Report\\" is certainly a massive special-effects hit, but great special effects and a superstar actor cannot always compensate for a weakened story and predictability.  The film is based upon the brilliant short-story (of the same name) that was written by Philip K Dick (1928-1982), who also wrote \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\".  Unfortunately, the original story was changed to better accommodate the film's lead actor, Tom Cruise.<br />Set in the U.S. in 2053, Americans have ceded many constitutional freedoms, privacy and protections to a new totalitarian federal agency whose sole purpose is to predict and prevent murders before they happen.  The agency, headed by Director Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow), predicts murders by using the skills of three people highly gifted with precognitive extrasensory perception.  The three \\"precogs\\" (as they are called) are regarded as being infallible, especially by Tom Cruise's character, John Anderton, who is one of the agency's star detectives. (In the original story, John Anderton was the police commissioner.)  To John's great disbelief, the precogs predict that he will commit a murder of someone that he does not know.  Like anyone else so accused, John runs to avoid the same fate as all other people accused and easily convicted of pre-crime: imprisonment via suspended animation.<br />Much of the film is devoted to John running from pre-crime detectives while he attempts to determine the identity of his supposed victim.  During the high-tech chase (Hollywood sure loves chase scenes), Spielberg highlights many special effects. These included cars that can drive along vertical surfaces and electronic billboards that cater their advertisements to each person after scanning and identifying each from his/her retina.  The billboards enhanced the film's  Orwellian flavor.<br />Minor performances in the film include Lois Smith (who played Kathy in the 1980 film \\"Resurrection\\"and Aunt Meg in the 1996 action film \\"Twister\\") as Dr. Iris Hineman, a good performance by Samantha Morton as the precog Agatha, and an excellent performce by Peter Stormare as black-market eye surgeon Dr. Solomon Eddie.  Plot twists used in the film's ending scenes (which totally abandoned Philip K. Dick's original ending) were highly reminiscent of an earlier Tom Cruise film, \\"Mission Impossible\\".  Tom Cruise's formulaic portrayal of John Anderton was, unfortuneately, typical of many past egocentric characters including Lt. 'Maverick' Mitchell in \\"Top Gun\\", Charlie Babbit in \\"Rain Man\\", Lt. Kaffee in \\"A Few Good Men\\", Mitch McDeere in \\"The Firm\\", Jerry in \\"Jerry Maquire\\", Frank Mackay in \\"Magnolia\\" and Ethan Hunt in \\"Mission Impossible\\", to name a few.<br />Though the film is entertaining, it is doubtful that \\"Minority Report\\" will attain the same level of respect and appreciation in the sci-fi community as \\"Blade Runner\\", which was based upon \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" and directed by Ridley Scott  (It would be interesting to see how Ridley Scott would have interpreted Philip K. Dick's short story and who he would have chosen to star in the film.)  With its Orwellian portrayal of the future, morbid humor, cyberpunk sets and great special effects, but less than stellar portrayal of the original story, \\"Minority Report\\" earns a reserved 4-star rating.  It also shows that combining a superstar director with a superstar actor doesn't necessarily result in an infallible film.
B00006RU5B|1.0|I cant belive i bought this cd.  This has to be the worst Album that I have ever bought.
0866119760|4.0|I rate this book 4 stars because it reel you in on a hook and it will not let go until you have read the whole thing. Its a keeper any person thats read it would say. It on the egde, exciting, and most of all it is very clever. Did I tell you that it is also Adventurous.<br />  The book is about two main people. One is the great Sherlock Holmes and his ever faithful Dr. Watson. They go on Adventures together and make there murder look like a fool for even thing to fool the great team.<br />  A quick example from the book is a evil uncle and two women in the house that the woman own. One day one woman was found dead and the local law enforcement had no clue until the great team of Sherlock and Watson were on the case. The soon discovered a small make on the girls neck. A air vent above the bed a locked door and no windows. They seached the uncles room and there was a bed and chair a air vent leading to the dead girls room. There was a small safe.One last thing snake food. Later Sherlock arested the man. Watson had no clue. Sherlock opened the safe a deadly snake came out. The chair was to reach the air vent the snake was to kill her and the food was used to lure the snake back to the uncles room. He was to kill the girls and then he would own the house.<br /><br />  That is just one of the many stories told. So if you want a fast pace book. Read The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
B00006CXSS|5.0|An absolute treasure in my military history/war movie collection.  As the late Steven Ambrose claimed, &quot;one of the most accurate depictions of combat ever made&quot;, I honestly couldn't agree more.
B00005JL96|4.0|I wasn't too sure what to make of the movie when I first saw it; I wasn't sure whether or not to be insulted by the way the &quot;pidgin&quot; (local dialect) was portrayed.  But after watching the movie a few more times I was glad I finally got the movie.  It is Disney's first fully shaded movie (vs. computer assisted or computer generated movie) in a while.  Stitch is a great character, not your atypical cute Disney character.  He is a little troublemaker that reminds me a lot of my cat.  The fact that this movie has a little more brawn and brains for what Disney has comeout with recently, is a good reason to get this one.
B00004YRQA|5.0|If there's one thing I can say about the 8MB Memory Card, it's this: you're going to use it.  A lot.  Let's face it - almost all of the games currently out for PS2 have some kind of save feature.  From Grand Theft Auto to Gran Turismo, you'll want to save your game.  So basically, you need a memory card.  The only question that remains is which card to buy - and I picked this one.  Sony's card is the most reliable, it's the most durable, and it's designed by Sony to work with Sony's Playstation 2.  What more can you say?  Yes, it's a bit expensive, but it's just as much an investment as any game.  And it's as essential as the controller.  Buy this product if you haven't already.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember is a wonderful little book.  Jamie Sullivan is a quiet loner, a teenage with few, if any friends.  Along comes Landon Carter, the son of a congressman, and the most unlikely of partners for Jamie.  However, through numerous twists of fate, and perhaps the power of prayer, Jamie and Landon come to find friendship and love in each other.  Although I would wager to say that most men would find this book a little corny, I absolutely loved this story!  It was sweet, easy to read, and entertaining.  (The book was also ten times better than the movie, in case any of you are using that for comparison.)  I highly recommend this book for a leisurely afternoon read.
B000002L68|2.0|I got the record mainly 'cos I wanted the song &quot;Purple rain&quot;. The rest of the material doesn't stand the test of time.

And I you don't have any references to, or memories of the time this album was released I think it's a waste of money

My friend along with her friend were killed and her boyfriend was seriously injured.  Since both my friend and her boyfriend were in my film class, my professor showed this film.<br />At the time, I was impressed with it, the pain of what happened was all too real... but looking back, she made a good choice in showing the film.  It showed me a little bit about dealing with loss as well as fulfilling your dreams... It's a wonderful movie about life, love, and passion... check it out for yourself!

B00005JKNF|1.0|BOB Altman is the greatest living or dead director of all time and I worship the film he walks on. Everything he has ever done is wonderful and this is the most wonderfulist film ever. It is just wonderful. The acting is Wonderful the cinematography is wonderful the directions are wonderful, it's just wonderful.<br /><br />BAH TWADDLE PIP<br /><br />Now lay off you fanboys. I did not like this movie. Though it is very interesting to see just how big an industry an English country estate really was. But as a film it lacks wit. John Cleese was good but not enough to make this a good movie. I am sorry but I have come to the inevitable conclusion that I just do not like Robert Altman's work. In future I shall avoid anything he has directed since MASH.<br /><br />Why are a wise man and a wise guy opposites?
B00004U8PA|5.0|This is a great movie. It is a bit weird, but I love it. I can't wait to get the DVD. I had bought the VHS for my aunt for Christmas. My aunt introduced me to this wonderful movie. For those of you who have not seen it, I suggest renting it right now. I have already rented it twice, in less than two weeks. It is that great.
0064471047|5.0|Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy have been sent to live with a professor in the country during the London air-raids.  While exploring the large house, Lucy finds that the wardrobe in the spare room transports her to the magical land of Narnia.  The country is under the spell of a terrible witch who has made it always winter but never Christmas.  At first, her siblings don't believe her, but soon they, too, find themselves in this new country.  With danger around every turn, they must survive treachery to join Aslan the lion in the fight to free Narnia and break the spell.<br />I read this book for the first time in third grade, and it holds up just as well today.  The pace of the writing is a bit slow, but the adventure is sure to hook readers.  Lewis creates a wonderful fanciful world that is lots of fun to visit.  This is the first I read and still my favorite.  There's something about this book that captures the wonder of finding a new, magical world that the other books don't have.<br />Lewis also created just the right spell for his land to horrify kids and to a lesser extend adults.  The idea of always having winter and all it brings but never getting to celebrate Christmas is too awful to mention.<br />A brief word about book order.  When I read this book, it was considered the first in the series.  Now, some people have put the books in chronological order, making it the second.  While I fell that reading them in the original order is the best approach, it really doesn't matter that much.  Nothing about the other books is spoiled here since this was the first one written, but not much about this book is spoiled if you read them in the order events occur.<br />Narnia is one of several classic kids' series about mythical countries and is still my favorite.  It's perfect for anyone wanting to leave our world behind for a touch of fantasy.
B00004U8P9|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. It is a bit weird, but it is a wonderful movie. My aunt is the one who got me to watch it. I love the songs &quot;Damint Janet,&quot; &quot;Time Warp&quot; and &quot;What Ever Happened To Saturday Night?&quot;. If you haven't seen this movie I suggest that you watch this movie.
B000067DNC|5.0|Excellent Sci-fi and one of the best series on TV since Classic Star Trek. Very original concept that works and works well. You have great writing, superb acting and top notch special effects. But my favorite thing about Stargate SG-1 is the camaraderie between the characters. Not just with the SG-1 team but with lesser characters too. One of my favorites is when Col. Jack O'Neill talks to Thor. You feel the connection between them even though in the back of your mind you know it's just Richard Dean Anderson talking to a puppet. If I had to pick a flaw in the DVD collection, it would be that they are only up to season 2 when the series is starting season 7. C'mon I need more SG-1!
037575251X|4.0|I thougth that it was a good book. There is some good action in it but at the same time its a very sad book. Although the character is a dog you can relate to him how he is a outcast and no one likes him to learning the way of the wild and becoming a good sled dog. He is a fast learner to the law of club and fang and is a strong leader. This was a good book with a great ending and i would suggest reading it.
B000002U6E|5.0|There is nothing to puzzle over for the second installment from Enigma, \\"The Cross of Changes\\". It is simply a great album. This is an album that flows from beginning to end without a single dead spot, or a single wrong note. The music is airy with, at times, a bit of an edge. The lyrics are perfect and the voice is used as an instrument whether it is just singing notes, Gregorian or Native American chants. This is a perfect album to turn off all the lights, turn up the stereo and just get lost in the music. <br />There are many great songs on this album. \\"Return to Innocence\\" has a strong Native American feel to it with the chant that is interspersed with soft lyrics. The music is so good that it has been pieces of it have been used in movies. Most notable is the ending portion of \\"The Eyes of Truth\\" in the file \\"The Matrix\\". The guitar screams through a solo in \\"I Love You...I'll Kill You\\" giving the song one of the more heavier edges on the album. \\"Silent Warrior\\" uses chants throughout in the background. In the middle of the song, tribal drums come forward providing support to the lyrics. <br />Enigma's songs are almost like stories. The song may grow and change as it progresses and many have several different movements to them. There is a beautiful blend of the different types of instruments in perfect proportions making the sum more than its parts. This is one band where you'll want to collect all their albums, and \\"The Cross of Changes\\" is a must have to any collection.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|'Untitled' would be it. I liked 'Almost Famous' a lot when it came out in the theater. It's a coming-of-age/road movie about loving rock 'n' roll and trying to not grow up. Other reviews have been written about the film's plot, etc., so I'll focus on this specific DVD. After watching the long, unreleased version, it's clear that this is the labor of love Cameron Crowe intended to make. I like 'Singles', 'Jerry Maguire' and 'Say Anything' a lot, but I like this movie more. I would have paid full price twice to sit in the theater for the extra half-hour. Here's what you get in this DVD that you didn't get in the theatrical release: more continuity in the story line, deleted scenes that really add to the characters, a hilarious scene with the band and Tenacious D's KG as a mind-tripping DJ and enough extras to keep you entertained for an entire sick day - music, behind-the-scenes stuff, commentary (I ran it in subtitles, no extra audio, but I think you can actually listen to Cameron Crowe and his mother talk if you want to) and if you like to read on your television, Rolling Stone articles by Cameron Crowe, as well as the film script. The DVD also provides a new way to have fun with your copy of 'Stairway to Heaven.' If you like good '70s-era rock music (Allman Bros., Led Zep, The Who, Elton John), this is definitely worth checking out.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is very funny and entertaining. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys off-the-wall humor with a heavy dose of cynicism. The book revolves around a war but that is hardly the point of the story. The war serves as more of the background that the author uses playfully to get his messages across.<br />The book is filled with very entertaining stories of our hero off to battle, trying to fight his way out. He tries everything only to find that war, and life, are full of catch-22s.  <br />Overall, this is a great story that relishes the dark side of humour. I would recommend it to anyone who has a liking to war stories and/or strange stories such as those by Kurt Vonnegut.  <br />Side Note: if you are looking for more serious war novels then you should consider the Naked and the Dead by Norman Mailer or the Gathering Storm by Winston Churchill.  Both are great books that deal more with the real character of war.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Everything I'd like to say to praise this landmark in film making has already been said, so I won't repeat it...But I would like to say, this is simple the most amazing thing I've ever seen.  I watched one hour a night for 10 nights straight with my mother, she's not a big fan of war films, and I was afraid she wouldn't like it...but after every episode, she looked forward to the next one as much as I did...<br />One thing, I thought the casting was fantastic.  I read Band of Brothers by Stephen Ambrose before buying the DVD set, and the actors all seemed to fill the roles of their respective characters almost exactly as I imagined it...  The special features disc also added more than 2 hours of good viewing time to the series.<br />This is a set that I want to share with all of my friends, but at the same time I cherish it so much I'm terrified to lend it out!  It's the best film/mini-series I've ever seen.

It wasn't classic testament and wasn't as good. not by far.  So i figured i would give them another shot, this show would be low.  I liked it a lot better, you could actually understand him which i liked, im not saying i don't like death metal.

Also if your looking for some good hardcore metal check out cryptopsy
0789723107|5.0|Since there are already some highly detailed reviews of this book, I'd like to touch on how I am using this book to teach others.<br />Being short, amusing, and full of relevant illustrations, this is an excellent text for those who are visual thinkers, don't have much time, or aren't techically inclined. I certainly wouldn't want to give a new student or a non-technical project stakeholder a copy of Jakob Nielsen's book to introduce them to usability.  I have assigned this book in a 200-level web design class I am teaching.  It touches on a little bit of everything, including writing for the web--something which many designers have been roped into doing during some emergency or other.  Krug gives a new web designer a lot to think about, and helps them understand that web design is more than the visuals.<br />There are two particularly useful parts of the book: one is the template provided showing how to conduct a usability test (though the work the Summers are doing for their forthcoming book will be on a more professional and complete level), and the other is chapter 6, on navigation, which features not only great information, but also visual exercises with before-and-after results.<br />Yes, there are more in-depth books out there, but this is a great place to start.
B00005JLEU|5.0|How can you not be pulled in by the wonder of a Miyazaki film?  This movie took me on a wonderful adventure; he has created the best film I have seen thus far.  The lessons for both adults and children alike in this creation can not be missed by either generation, for adults it will be deep and thought compelling, for children it will be their simple understanding that will pull it all together.  Like â~My Neighbor Totoroâ, â~Kikiâs Delivery Serviceâ, and â~Princess Mononokeâ he as created another deep film that will take you somewhere you have never been before.  How can you not give this film ***** 5 Stars??  This will be another film to be placed in my collection that will grow with my children, and theirs, do not think of this as just another Disney Classic this film and all others by this director are in a category all their own.

B00004X01U|2.0|This album represents Madonna at one of her creative low points. Opening with the mundane and childish Music and closing with the mature and beautiful Gone. Much like Bedtime Stories this album is a mixed bag and has several sub par tracks jumbled in with the good. Contrived and pretencious lyrics abound on many of the tracks. Also the synthesizer vocal effect is used in embarrasing excess making the album sound terribly dated. The lyrics are not printed in the cd booklet for a very good reason. This reason being that the song writing lacks any imagination or creativity so there is no reason to want to read them. The all time low points in Madonna's career are the cornball Nobody's perfect, Runaway Lover, Paradise is not for me and Impressive Instant. Be sure to buy a programable CD player to spare your ears from such garabage. The rest of the songs are pleasant enough and worth listening to.
B00001QEE9|3.0|Disney's animated film, Pinocchio, is the story of a marionette, which is also known as a puppet on strings.  He is fashioned out of Gepetto's own hands, and steals the puppet master's heart -- wooden or real, Gepetto loves him anyway.  Gepetto has this wish for Pinocchio to be a real boy. He wishes it on a shooting star Okay, moving on.<br />The Blue Fairy comes to visit the wooden doll while his master sleeps. She grants the man his wish.  Suddenly the doll is talking and walking and dancing and singing.  He's an all around entertainer that wooden boy.<br />A small cricket named &quot;Jiminey&quot; has taken up residence in Gepetto's home.  Blue Fairy deems &quot;Jiminey Cricket&quot; Pinocchio's conscious.  This means he will be that &quot;voice of reasoning&quot; for Pinoc., to help him live a true and honest life and to be brave. If Pinocchio can do all this, Blue Fairy says, he then will be a real boy.  &quot;Let your conscious be your guide&quot; is what the glowing girl reminds him.  Does he listen?  Does he stray from the straight and narrow path?  You'll have to watch to find out.  It's a story full of adventures of good and bad, and fun musical numbers.  My 2 yr old son loves the songs, &quot;I got no strings&quot;, &quot;Hi Diddle de&quot;, and already knows most of the words to them.  Other songs in the film include &quot;Give a little whistle&quot;, and &quot;When you wish upon a star&quot;.  In addition to these charming numbers is a majestically charged musical score which highlights this geniune piece of Disney magic.<br />Pinocchio learns that honesty, bravery, and unselfish acts help him lead a better life.(If only some of us out here in the real world could have a conscious like him!)  He faces big rough creeps that want to use him and throw him away, and he also challenges the whale, Monstro in order to save Gepetto's life.  Some of these scenes are frightening.  As much as I do like this movie, I was utterly disturbed by the whole &quot;Pleasure Island&quot; scene, where boys were being taken to and turned into donkeys because they were stupid.  Watching Lampke(Pinoc's new friend) being transformed was bizarre and creepy.  But that's how the story goes...<br />I like this movie for it's music and story of the boy, but there are those few sideline parts that creeped me out.

B00005JLF5|4.0|I must admit that I was never a big fan of the show while it was on the air until the last two seasons, but as I watched reruns of the show I realized what I had been missing out on. Deep Space Nine was the first trek show that invested in the dramatic power of continuing storylines. As the series went on, we truly began to feel like we know the cast personally and, instead of the occasionally unrealistic idealism presented by TNG, this show sticks more to a truthful human perspective.<br />The show is buoyed by its great cast of characters. Avery Brooks was always the hub of the show, and he would make Commander Ben Sisko the most nuanced captain in the trek universe. We see some of that fire in \\"Emissary\\", the series' pilot episode. After the tragic loss of his wife, Sisko refuses to move on, not allowing himself to grieve for her and heal. How he gets over this pain forms a great backbone for a great series that addresses the perennial motifs of the wormhole, the Bajoran faith, and Sisko's unsolicited role as spiritual leader of Bajor. He also gets to punch Q on the very enjoyable romp \\"Q-Less.\\" His second in command, Major Kira Nerys, an ex-terrorist and no-nonsense type gradually comes to admire and respect her Starfleet superior. \\"Past Prologue\\" shows her putting old revolutionaries over Starfleet, and \\"Battle Lines\\" makes her come face-to-face with her violent self. Jadzia Dax always had a curious relationship with Sisko and there was always some sexual tension between her and Bashir (although nothing came of it), and her past is addressed in \\"Dax\\". Bashir was disliked by fans at first, but he eventually won them over. His fantasy embarrasingly becomes reality in \\"If Wishes Were Horses\\" when his mind creates another version of Dax who is attracted to him. Chief O'Brien was transferred over from TNG, and his role in season 1 is minor compared to later seasons, but he shows his sympathy for an alien underdog in \\"Captive Pursuit\\" and becomes the spiritual leaderof a Bajoran town in \\"The Storyteller\\". Odo was always an enigma on the show, but his quest was always for the truth and justice, as demonstrated in \\"A Man Alone\\" and others. Having Quark on the station allowed Ferengi culture to be explored thoroughly, and although this aspect would create some really really really horrible clunkers later on, the enjoyable \\"The Nagus\\" is a great Godfather derivation. We are introduced to Garak in Past Prologue, but his role in the show is limited in this season.<br />All of this aside, \\"Duet\\" is a great episode examining the Bajoran-Cardassian race relation issue. The fact that they were able to make such a compelling story about a conflict introduced just months earlier shows the show's potential.<br />In short, season 1 was intensely character-driven. Lots of exposition, as would be expected, and characters from TNG paid a visit: Picard, Q, the Duras sisters, and Lwaxana Troi. A solid foundation for a great show.
B000021XS0|5.0|I could write a long review about what makes this album one of the crowning musical achievements of the 90's. I could tell of the amazing technical musicianship, the diversity, the switching of musical styles. I could tell of the wide array of musical instruments used here, from sitar to trumpet to piano to a gospel choir. I could tell of the thrilling concept of a 1928 murder mystery being relived by a man in his dreams today. I could rant and rave for hours on end...<br />But I'm not going to.<br />This album is a 77-minute rollercoaster ride, done in the same vein as \\"A Change Of Seasons\\" or \\"Six Degress Of Inner Turbulence.\\" All of the 5 guys in Dream Theater are in top form, including newcoming keyboardist(at the time) Jordan Rudess. If you are into prog-rock or alternative, or even metal, grab this. It's not pretentious. It's not emotionless. It's not stupid. It's art. It's what Tool should be and what Pink Floyd would be if they were still around making music. These guys are the U2 of prog-metal. This album is their Joshua Tree.<br />Buy it. Make it a part of your life. You'll thank me later.
B00005JLXC|5.0|Forget Ben Affleck, the guy is getting married--soon.  Well, maybe not so soon.  Anyway, just see this movie to check out the spankin' new Hollywood Golden Boy, Irish heartrob Colin Farrell.  The man is as hot as chili wings in Palm Springs.  Grindin'!  Plus he has the acting abilities of a seriously talented actor (STA), as you can see in 'Tigerland' and 'Minority Report'--come on, how many people can actually stare down Tom Cruise and take on Ben Affleck?  With moves on big blockbusters like 'Minority Report' and 'Daredevil', you have to figure the guy is gonna end up in the stardom slot.<BR>To give 'Daredevil' its due, however, the movie does look pretty good.  Ben Affleck, a DD fan himself, seems to be a convincing choice for the Man Without Fear, and 'Alias' chick Jennifer Garner's moves on the big screen come off pretty well.  Overall, this movie is built like a serious blockbuster, with lead Affleck and spy chick Garner doing the usual karate action (See how 'The Matrix' has everyone trapped inside it! 'Reloaded' & 'Revolutions' 2003!  Whoo-hoo!).  It's obvious that this movie wants to become the next 'Spider-man'.  Who knows?  Perhaps it will, through the loyalty of DD's fans + Mr. Affleck's rabid fan club + 'Alias' groupies + at least one person in the world who goes to see Colin Farrell make his argument for super-stardom (that would be me, for all those with the seemingly low IQs).  Add these elements together, set the temperature for smoking hot, and 'Daredevil' will find an audience...and perhaps a franchise.
B00005MP58|5.0|Colin Firth is the perfect Mr. Darcy; Elizabeth Ehle is so very expressive and the ideal heroine. I thoroughly enjoyed the film -- the film is well-paced, well-acted, well-casted. Despite the length of the two volumes combined (over five hours), I was never bored like I was when I had to watch ponderous adaptations of classic novels and Shakespeare plays in school. I kept wanting more. Overall: Excellent!
0783240236|2.0|In fact, the only hitch film worse than it is To Catch A Thief. The so-called Master of Suspense masters mostly boredom and dullness throughout the movie. If you can get past the first 50 minutes, though, you'll be okay. The definate highlight of the film was when a man drops a match on a trail of gas. It blows up, and you are shown four stills of Tippi Hendren's terrified face. It was supposed to be serious, but it was hilarious. My brother and I watched it over and over again; it cracked us up.<BR>Eventually, the film has SOME good parts with the attacking birds; but those scenes could sometimes be disappointing. Really, I do not recommend seeing it.
B00000IL29|4.0|I would rate this CD as being a Jazz classic were it not for one or two weak moments in the set; that aside, it rates as one of Herbie hancocks best efforts to date, and is definitely a Jazz essential.<br />&quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; is a brilliant, mellow track, one that highlights both impressive individual improvisations and stunningly cohesive collaberation.  &quot;The eye of the hurricane&quot; is a snappy little number that alomst allows its impressive style to overshadow its rather substantial substance.  &quot;Little One&quot; veers back towards the mellow, serving as a quiet interlude before the free-form cacaphony of &quot;Survival of the Fittest,&quot; a work that is not as cohesivelly structured as I would prefer.  &quot;Dolphin Dance&quot; is a pleasently fitting close to the album.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|i enjoy watching wrestling on television and heard this song as an entrance song. since then i've been ensnared in it. I like to listen to hard rock, alternative, and heavy metal, but this cd is the best thing i've heard yet. it's catchy, yet calming in a eerie way. the song &quot;all the things she says&quot; is my favorite, but all the songs are a pleasure to listen to.
0375823360|5.0|Ok so maybe its not for children...BUT...it does say recomended for young adult.  I read these books all through my middle school years so 13 at the oldest.  I'm not warped, I didn't turn out anti-christian.  Those easily offended are warned to stay away, but those who belive substance is more than a surface explination of the authors views on god read it.  Its amazing.  Full of plot, and characters that are so rich and deep, and alagorical yet focused and clear at the same time.  It is by far one of the pioneering books of my time.
0385508417|4.0|Many books talk about the joys of Christmas.  This book, however, moves away from the fantasy vision and delves into the reality - the cost, the effort, and the stress.  A man's only daughter moves out of the country for the first time, and decides that instead of spending the six thousand dollars on Christmas, he'll go with his wife on a cruise.  While a good idea, it seemed like every force in the neighborhood didn't want him to skip Christmas.<br />It's filled with light humor and good observations.  On a deeper note, it deals with conformity in a society.  Both work and are enjoyable.<br />As usual, Grisham is fluid and writes a good tale.  His non-law books are the best, not because he can't make a good legal thriller, but that he's a much better storyteller instead.<br />Unfortunately, he adds a little plot twist in the middle of the book, resulting in a cheesy, happily ever after ending that didn't fit with the book.<br />At less than 200 pages, this book is a quick read, but perhaps not the best value.
B000063CMK|4.0|Let's start with this: progressive rock/metal is weird. It takes time to grow into you. So if you are expecting to like this CD on the first (or even the second) listen, you're in for an unpleasant adventure.<BR>That does not mean the disk is bad...absolutely not true. But you do need to have patience and repeated listens will open you to the high quality of the music.<BR>This is the 4th album by PoS and as you would expect from the experience that 3 studio albums should provide, this is the most mature and the best built of their albums. It is a concept album (like the other 3 are too), so again, understanding the songs will require you to understand the album as a whole. The songs are hard, dark and very emotional. Gildenlow is one of those characters that you can \\"feel\\" when hearing their music with attention. His emotions are very permeated on the music and lyrics, so if he is singing something angry, the song sounds downright angry! The use of chorus is simply genius: 3 of the other members of the group sing in diferent layers while Gildenlow does his own part, so you get 4 sets of different, yet coordinated lyric parts at once on some of the songs. It almost sounds as if Gildenlow had actually sang the 4 different parts and then mixed them using studio effects, but once you pay attention you know that the vocals are different. Guitars are marvelous, as both axe-men shred and then go melancholic in a heartbeat. Drumming is simply impressive! for a drum-aficionado like me it gets to be a pain to follow the guy's moves, and even after having heard this album a 100 times, there are some places that are simply undecipherable for a rookie!<BR>The only song here that sounds a bit out of place with the rest of the music is \\"This Heart of Mine\\". It is not a recent song, but rather an old piece brought back to life by Gildenlow. It will sound 80-ish, but that's because the song IS 80-ish.<BR>Favorite tracks from the CD: \\"Ending Theme\\", \\"A Trace of Blood\\", \\"Undertow\\" and\\"Beyond the Pale\\".<BR>Another consideration: just like any other progressive album, songs can be lenghty and constantly shift timings and structures, so if you are the kind that loves Nu-Metal, avoid this disk at all cost (unless you are ready to turn into some serious []music).
0316666343|4.0|This is the first book in a very long time that I have picked up.  From the moment I opened it I was caught right up and could hardly put it down-including neglecting my kids!  I only answered the really LOUD screams.  Funny and sad all at once.
B0000668IF|5.0|I can forgive Moby for selling almost all of the songs on this album before it was released. I'd rather listen to decent music when I'm being shilled to.<br />That said, I still think that I like PLAY better than 18. Similar albums, both 18 songs, both start, build, rest, and finish strong. Play seemed to have a little more soul and spiritual influence, but it's great to see at least some evolution from album to album. A distinct break from the tendency that many bands have to continue to put out the same album time after time.
B000068IEU|4.0|This film has been so controversial and caught up in legend and rumour that I never knew what to really expect when I actually got the chance to see it for myself. I've read many reviews and read various analysis and theories but I've wanted to see it for myself to make up my own mind about it.<br />It's a confusing film in some ways because the assaults and then the murders of the two girls is a horrible thing to witness but they are intercut with scenes featuring almost \\"comedic\\" scenes of two rather pathetic and inept policemen and two parents, preparing a birthday party, that are so \\"sweet\\" and \\"lovely\\" you can hardly bear to watch. You're wincing one second and then smirking the next so it's confusing dealing with the jarring images and it does ruin the tension and flow of the film a little.<br />The murder of Phyllis is truly vile and the performance that Lucy Grantham gives is superb. Actually the perfomances from all the leads are excellent but it's Lucy Grantham that really stands out for me. Sandra Cassel's performance is quite something because she really looks traumatised through out and is quite believeable.<br />It's not a nice film infact it's rather nasty and it's not a film you would want to watch over and over but it's worth seeing to make up your own mind and it's worth seeing to see Wes Craven's beginnings.<br />The extras on this disc are excellent. The commentary by Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham is insightful and interesting as is the featurette - including input from cast members. The \\"Outtakes\\" are brief but good. What's really interesting is the trailer because if I had seen that advertising the film at the cinema I would never have seen the film because it makes it look like it's going to be rubbish!<br />The film shows signs of it's age - sometimes it's too dark and the sound is poor - but that's not a bad thing because that gives it a documentary feel and makes it even more disturbing.
B00005BJPO|5.0|This is not hyperbole, Akira really represents the highest point of anime (and manga for that matter).  I saw Akira in the original Japanese format a long time before the English dubbed version hit the US.  I am as amazed now as I was then.  As well, Akira does not use computer animation as it really missed that advent by a couple of years.<br />In some ways the movie is better in its plotting than the manga, but it also takes some different directions.  This makes it a good companion piece to the manga.  it also had a much better ending (or at least one that is comprehendable).<br />The limited edition is okay, some of the extras you probably have to be a die hard fan to enjoy.  Either edition is a must own for any serious anime, animation or science fiction fan.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|From that amazing video to their saucy, polished to the nth degree image this great duo is all about the music. Their infectious, europop/techno beats - embellished with a touch of &quot;alternative feeling&quot; - lingers persistency even after the homoerotic element seems to wear out. Don't listen to the critics, judge for yourselves. They're number one all over Europe and soon to conquer America.<BR>Marvelous stuff!
B00000K0DT|5.0|The morning after a five-man gang's attempt to loot a ship in Los Angeles harbor ends in a litter of corpses, the lone survivor tells a police investigator what happened. He explains that it all started when the five of them were hauled into a police lineup in New York. They were then all recruited for one big job by Keyser Soze, a mysterious criminal mastermind who may or may not even exist.<br />And so begins &quot;The Usual Suspects,&quot; a gritty crime drama in which nothing is what it seems to be -- or is it? Kevin Spacey won a well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of &quot;Verbal,&quot; the talkative survivor who weaves a fabric of lies, betrayal, and blood. The movie is filled with double-crosses galore, and the Oscar-winning screenplay is amazing. This is one movie that has to be seen more than once, just to pick up what you missed the first time.
B00005JLRR|3.0|For a show that held most fans enthralled with its character connections, this movie did not do justice to the intricasies of those relationships.  This story should have been tailored to this crew's unique interations with each other and the world around them.<br />The superb actors, the genre, the memory and especially the fans deserved more.
B00007L4MJ|4.0|Heard it's beautiful. But...unfortunately the folks at Kino decided to present the movie at 24 fps rather than the original 20 fps. 4% difference in length of film and the film will draw snickers during certain key sequneces. Why oh why did they do this? Speeding up the film. Kino toured the film at it's original 20 fps format at considerable inconvenience. Why they didn't just keep it faithful for the end product is beyond me. Keep it real!
B000066NW0|5.0|At first, I wasn't sure if purchasing this CD would be a good idea. I mean, I had heard and loved the first of her hit songs, &quot;Complicated&quot;. After buying it, I was amazed. All of Avril's songs are great! I'm not even the biggest fan of this type of music, and I still loved it. <br />The songs on this CD are all different (in a good way), but Avril keeps her &quot;punk&quot; identity throughout the whole thing. It is definitely worth buying Let Go-trust me- you WON'T REGRET IT!!
B00006L83N|5.0|I can't get this CD out of my player!  Every time I put in another CD that I like, inevitably I reach for this one again, and crank it up.  There just isn't a bad track on it, even the bonus track is good.<br />Be warned however:  You must like metal!  Not just the 80's hair band type, not the nu-metal of today, but the Dio, Helloween, Accept, Yngwie, early Anthrax, early Metallica type metal.  You must also like odd meters, and tempo changes; songs with more than just a 4/4 beat (like Rush or Kansas, only more Metal!)  Guitar riffs that stick in your brain long after the CD's over with!  You must also like the occasional 20 plus min. song, which is a staple of this genre.  You must also like a vocalist who can sing a nice ballad one minute, and sing his ... off like Dio the next, with a little bit of an aggressive growl at the right times.  Russell Allen is the best vocalist in Prog Metal, period.  But it's Michael Romeo who stands out the most.  While not a truly innovative guitarist, he more than holds his own against any other guitarist in this category.  Fans of previous efforts by the band should note that the keyboards take more of a backseat, then on previous records.<br />Just listen to the song samples.  If you're not moved to buy this CD, then browse over to the Britney Spears section.  Just about every other Prog Metal band out there has some elements that are awesome, and some that suck.  Not this CD!  IMHO, this is what Prog Metal should be:  Progressive in tempo and songwriting, Metal in sound and attitude, with vocals that even a non Prog Metaller can enjoy.  Buy it now, you will not be disappointed!
B00006RIO7|5.0|An incredible soundtrack to an incredible movie. Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta Jones, and Richard Gere give pitch perfect performances, and who would have thought. Catherine shines on the opening All That Jazz, its sexy and exciting. Renee Zellwegger impresses on the sultry Funny Honey, with her soft, angelic voice. Richard Gere is suave and cool on Razzle Dazzle. There are so many other highlights. Queen Latifah knocks em dead on the brassy When You're Good to Mama, proving that some Rappers can sing as well, and the Cell Block Tangois fun and hilarious. The new songs added to the soundtrack don't really fit in with the entire soundtrack, but Anastacias powerful, sultry pipes on Love is A Crime is alot of fun. The rap version of the Cell Block Tango by Queen Latifah, Lil Kim, and Macy Gray is a bad attempt at trying to create another Lady Marmalade, however, its a small problem in a otherwise perfect album. The must have soundtrack of the year!
0553573403|5.0|this is a truely excellent work, however, it isn't for everyone.<br />#1) there are a lot of people running around, and while I found it pretty easy to keep everyone straight, it could be a problem for some. Along the same lines, GRRM writes each \\"chapter\\" from the perspective of a single character, then switches to the perspective of another character for the next chapter.  In a way, it can make the tale seem like a set of short stories, and like all good cliffhangers, it will frequently move away from a character just when he is at the brink of something important<br />#2)Magic is pretty muted. The items that couldn't be found on earth are few and far between. In its stead is political intruge and the cruel roughness of life where wounds fester and people die from a minor wound, people starve, people die in childbirth, etc.  Modern fantasy writers seem to forget that the middle ages were a rotten dirty rat infested flea hole in the mud type of place. GRRM does not.  If you want dragons and spells and flying carpets and hospital sanitary conditions, these aren't the books for you<br />3#) similar to above, GRRM's books would DEFINATELY get an R rating for violence and for sex.  I wouldn't say it is gratuitious, nor is sex all that often seen, but it is present, and when it is bieng written about, it is direct and forceful, and graphic. GRRM also realizes that sex is sometimes just about one person and their victim, especially in the connection between war and rape that we seem to forget went hand in hand 500 years ago.<br />So, if you've got what it takes, this series will give you something special. A cast of hundreds, earth shattering events, intrigue and political manipulation, the good guys don't always win, the bad guys have motives that we can understand, and the vast majority of people are grey and just trying to get by. Fast action, great dialog, and plenty of humerous moments to go along with those cliffhanges.
B00006X06U|4.0|Back in the 70's when Joni released her &quot;Mingus&quot; album, she said that she lost her radio play and a lot of her audience soon after.  Years later in an interview, she said it was because she dared &quot;to work with a giant from another idiom&quot;.  I don't know if this is true or not but in looking back I remember there seemed to be an angry backlash at the time. Accused of being dilettante by the jazz camp and simply bewildering the folkies that admired her so, Joni followed her own restless musical exploration from then on. <br />Now, it looks as if she has confounded her critics and fans once again with the release of &quot;Travelogue&quot; which we're told is the last.<br />The choices of songs are interesting and may be tied to musical elements from the original recordings that show off their richness with an orchestral palette.  Like the beautiful breaking of the waves at Malibu in &quot;Trouble Child&quot; or the all male chorus in the question/answer duet of &quot;The Sire of Sorrow&quot;, some wonderful musical moments are revealed.<br />Some of the tracks work better than others but all in all it's a fitting and beautiful cap to the musical journey Ms. Mitchell has taken over the years.  I've grown up listening to these songs and the maturity, depth and intelligence of these arrangements as well as Joni's voice echoes my own &quot;travelogue&quot; and I find myself listening again and again.<br />Finally, I can't help but put in a word for my friend Richard Isen who's great cover of &quot;Willy&quot; is available on his new CD available here.  Joni fans, pounce!
B00005U2JL|1.0|Marilyn Manson have not been good since they got rid of Daisy Berkowitz on guitar.  Listen to Portrait of an American Family, that album is 10 times better than anything they have put out since.  That was also during the time they were somewhat normal, their looking feminine era hadn't started yet. I have seen that happen with so many bands, where their first album is way better than anything they ever put out again (ie. Korn, Deftones, Rage Against The Machine).  These bands need to stop getting away from what made them explode onto the scene.  It's almost like they try to get too creative on their next albums.
6305842442|1.0|Whats up, we get ridley's legend in both versions why not blade runner. I do like this version better, but watching the narated version is like another good type of movie. oh well. Maybe Mr. Scott will someday get off his high horse and let us see the American version as well as his English version.
B00000JY1X|5.0|There isn't anything I can add to what has already been said.  This set is simply amazing!  Great music and intelligent and honest lyrics, make for a riveting 3 discs of music.<br />To correct a previous reviewer; the title (\\"69 Love Songs\\") is not derived from the sexual meaning of the number 69.  Nor is Merritt childish enough to name a brilliant collection of songs after something so vulgar!  Rather, the conceived project was \\"100 Love Songs.\\"  It was intended to be a theater piece. After Merritt had composed 69 of the songs, the project was scrapped.  However, Merritt realized he had 69 brilliant songs and was able to get them produced into this collection.  <br />What I will add that makes this collection so great is these songs are written from every perspective (man to woman, woman to man, woman to woman, and man to man).  It's nice to see brilliant songs constructed about same sex love, such as \\"When My Boy Walks Down the Street.\\"  <br />Fantastic!
B000025AKT|5.0|Songs of Distant Earth is absolutely one of the most fantastic musical experiences I've had in my life.  It's an absolutely wondrous integrated piece of music.  From the moment I pressed play on my CD player until the whirr of the CD stopping, I felt like I had been transported to the inside of some glass spaceship cruising through the heavens.  It's like sitting outside and looking up at the stars on a warm spring evening and if you want one of the closest experiences to being in space that many of us hear on earth could have, this CD's certainly worth the money.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I was disappointed when I came here and discovered that this film had not been released on to home video yet. It is incredible....not to mention extremely bizarre in its content. To anyone who has a penchant for the eccentric - see this motion picture IMMEDIATELY.
B00007GZQI|5.0|For what is basically a \\"bargain\\" DVD, the video remastering is a tremendous improvement over the ghastly quality of the \\"middle-speed\\" LP VHS version I popped for a couple of years ago.  It must be very close to the original film's colors, with highly natural skin tones and great overall dynamic range.  Saturation is a tad underdone, which is to my taste.<br />Audio is another matter.  It's all over the map, ranging from quite clear to \\"telephone\\" quality, but I suspect the original was essentially beyond meaningful repair.  Still, it is readily decipherable throughout.<br />Considering that it includes one of the funniest scenes EVER filmed -- the \\"mystery\\" singer performing \\"Mad About the Boy\\" for the \\"mystery\\" listener at the ship's bar -- this DVD is a must for anyone with a madcap sense of humor.
6302038308|5.0|Finally, someone made a sequel that was better than the first movie! People always make the case that this is simply 'Evil Dead' redone on a better budget; but while the plots are consistent in some instances, 'Evil Dead' was never as good a film as either of the sequels it spawned. Indeed, this is a sequel to the first film with notable differences. Saying 'Evil Dead 2' is a remake is akin to saying 'Evil Dead' is a remake of 'Night of the Living Dead'.<BR>The plot is familiar; several people caught in a secluded house surrounded by the undead. What does make this film different from other such films with similar plot and budget is the humorous slapstick fashion intermixed with some truly surprising and uncomfortable moments. The special effects in both movies set them apart from peers. 'Evil Dead', on the other hand, added no notably new elements to the horror genre. 'Evil Dead 2' does indeed add more to the genre, and should be in any horror collection that includes films made after 'Exorcist'. If this isn't in your collection; you don't have a collection.
B00005Y228|3.0|In the beginning, I listen to this cd non-stop. But now, the music has become boring and that's not a good sign. I still LOVE the classic, &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; and &quot;Burning Up&quot; is still good. Oh and &quot;Fragile&quot; and &quot;Love At First Sight&quot; and &quot;Come Into My World&quot;. But I only listen to those songs every now and then and I never listen to the other songs anymore. I advise you to pick up Kylie's &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; (her best album) and &quot;Light Years&quot;. They are older than &quot;Fever&quot;, but they are wwaayy better.
630486759X|5.0|I loved the Video Guide.  It was full of great information.  I reccommend it for the whole family.
B00004RF9I|5.0|My second favorite movie of all time. One of the most important, ignored, prophetic stories ever told...and Faye Dunaway is gorgeous! Watch it and try to fool yourself into thinking things aren't this bad....really....
0316776963|5.0|I have lived in France, struggled with the language, and had about David's luck learning it. I was in intense pain from laughing SO hard during the stories on being in France, especially the part where the French students with limited vocabularies attempt to explain Easter. I had to put it down pretty much every paragraph to recover physically.<br />Yes, buy it.
B000066F6H|4.0|The first time I heard of the Hives, my friend from Sweden was bragging about them. She called them, \\"the greatest rock band since U2\\". Of course, I had my doubts because who can compare them to the great U2? And mostly, when have the Swedes EVER been known to rock? After all this is the land of Max Martin, ABBA, and Ace of Base. But after listening to this album, I must say I am impress. This band is loaded with talent and great energy. The songs are not bad at all. Yes, they are using styles from other bands, but they have something more to offer than \\"attitude\\". My favorite songs are \\"Die, All right!\\", \\"Outsmarted\\", \\"Supply and demand\\". I understand others doubts about this group, but IF they get better and develop their own identity, the future is theirs.
B00007E8V4|3.0|Don't get me wrong, System is one of the better rock groups out there today, but this album didn't do it for me.  I bought the album hoping for a variety of musical talent as they showed in their previous album Toxicity, but all I got was this coverless, repetative compact disc.  But I do enjoy listening to this CD every once in a while, but I do not think this CD is incredible.
B000055Y0X|5.0|The best example of why we all should move to New Zealand. Or Switzerland. Or the moon. This is foreign policy at its dumbest, which seems to be the status quo. George C. Scott gives the performance of his life (which is saying alot) and Peter Sellers is at the top of his form. Can anyone see this and think our government really works?
0743424425|4.0|Stephen King's THE SHINING is a classic piece of modern day literature.  The story is enthralling and unlike other early King stories, has several layers.  Is the book solely about a hotel possessed by evil spirits?  Or are all the horrifying images merely physical manifestations of what happens to Jack Torrance as he suffers through a total mental and psychotic breakdown?  The answer is both.  The book is thrilling and suspenseful and full of unforgettable images. Of course, it's not for everyone, but if you have never read a King novel, this is one of his \\"horror\\" pieces that I would recommend.
B0000793X6|5.0|I cant believe this, how can those who already have this cd NOT review this excellant band's latest album!? the multimedia pc section was awesome to the extreme. kudos to Mya for supplying those superb 3d animations. and kamelot has outdone themselves this time. having various musical influences from around the world, i could here the familiar tunes of arabic/east indies and some japanese sounding tunes(as much as i can recognize). i have this 'fetish' for arabic tunes after listening to Nights Of Arabia from their older album, The Fourth Legacy, which was amplified more in LOTR's latest movie, TTT, when the elves came to helm's deep for reinforcements, the arabic/east indies influence is obvious. gone are their technical bruteness, replaced with finesse and ballards. that might be my onli complaint, since i enjoyed heavier tracks like Fall From Grace and Karma in the last album. overall its a magical journey of amazing proportions. hell even the covers are uber 1337. all this shows how much they stand apart from your traditional run of the mill, metal bands. Notable songs include Center of the universe, farewell, edge of paradise, a feast for the vain. well IMO anyway. order hard and fast, the ltd edition isnt available on kamelot's own e-shop anymore even, so pray that the ones over here dun run out as well.<br />CHEERS!
B000000W5N|5.0|For those, like me, unable by the cruelty of birth to have seen the Stones at their best, this is a reminder of what today's monstrosity is all about.<br />If you were to wake up in the darkened corridor of a washed-out hotel at 6am with a bottle of whiskey in one hand and no money to your name, this album would provide the soundtrack to make it all seem OK. Keith's enthusiasm for his craft was matched at this stage of his career only by his appetite for the fullness of life, and both collide here to devastating, knee-trembling effect. The songs all come equipped with down-and-dirty guitar riffs fitted as standard, while Mick is able to wring every last sneer of emotion from his vocals.<br />This is where rock & roll meets the blues, gets laid and gives birth to a screaming love-child that the parents can be proud of.
061318114X|4.0|I always have a high expectation when reading a book that has won the Pulitzer Prize.  For better or worse, I am expecting a stay up all night, can't put down type of book.  Well I have to admit that this book did not fulfill this expectation.  To put my review in context I have an interest in general history but not so much in science.  That probably explains why at times I felt this book dragged or just buried me is too much detail.  The author was making a case for his theory, therefore, he had to spell out the many examples for his work to be accepted.  It is just that for a general reader it was a bit much.<br />I must say that the book is full of interesting historical facts and stories.  I found my self saying, \\"so that's what happened\\" a number of times.   The author also lays out his theory very well and I found myself agreeing with it. The author does write in a user-friendly way.  My one complaint with the history is that I felt he was a little too kind to the European explores and following armies that decimated the populations of the Americas.   It was just that for me, this subject has a marginal interest therefore, the massive amounts of detail slowed me down.  If you fall into the same category as myself then make sure you put aside a good amount of time for he book.
B00005NP04|5.0|Until recently I haven't been that big of a country fan. I liked Shania and Faith, and that was about it. So I turn on CMT and GAC to catch their videos and I see some of Martina's videos, like \\"Concrete Angel\\", \\"Blessed\\", \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Love's The Only House\\". Last November, I watched CMT's Top 40 Countdown of Females in country. They showed clips of Martina's videos such as \\"A Broken Wing\\" and \\"Whatever You Say\\". I was very impressed with her vocally. And I thought she really should have been higher than No. 25 This month I finally got around to buying her hits collection. It's the first time I've ever bought a greatests hits by someone I've never owned a album of. All the songs I'd heard and loved by her was on it. I love the nice ballads such as \\"There You Are\\", \\"Wrong Again\\" and \\"Where Would You Be\\". \\"Safe In The Arms Of Love\\" is another fave. So is \\"When God-Fearin' Women Get The Blues.\\" This song has finally gotten me to appreciate the traditional country sound. The happy songs \\"Happy Girl\\" and \\"Blessed are great.\\" I love the 'issue songs' \\"Indepedence Day\\", \\"Concrete Angel\\" \\"Love's The Only House\\" and \\"A Broken Wing\\" which is probably my fave song. A country song with a lot of soul. I love it! And now I'm gonna go out and buy all her albums.
0316666343|5.0|This was by far one of the best books I have ever read.  I sat down and started reading it one night, and could not put it down.  It was exciting, and full of surprises and suspense.
B000002KFJ|5.0|I did not buy \\"Sabotage\\" when it first came out, because Creem magazine's reviews tore the album apart. Guess that proves that \\"Sabotage\\" was ahead of its time. The music is fresh decades later, and its dark tone is not the oddity that it was in the plastic Seventies. The only shame is that Black Sabbath could not sustain this peak, destroying themselves with drugs as they were. My favorite song on this album rotates between \\"The Writ,\\" \\"The Thrill of It All,\\" \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" and \\"Hole in the Sky.\\" These songs are not only of uncommon power and superb musicianship for heavy metal, but they also are the best produced in the Sabbath catalogue. It's a crystal clear mix that comes out even better in digital, unlike some of the previous Sabbath recordings set to CD.<br />Creem may have blanched at the album's lyrical self-obsession, lots of tales about how hard it is to be a rock star, which is hard to stomach. But this album should be cherished as the best example of Ozzy Osborne vocals on record. No way he could begin to sing most of this stuff today, or even ten years ago. Amazing range, intonation, intensity and clarity. The rest of his career Ozzy has survived on personality, but \\"Sabotage\\" proves the man had real talent.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Back in the 70's, punk was considered to be simple 3-chord child's play. And then The Clash's London Calling came out, and rewrote all the rules of the genre.<br />This album was remarkable for its diversity. Ska, rockabilly, reggae, straight punk, pop--London Calling blends so many styles in its artistic vision that it could've been a mess (much like the overindulgent triple album Sadinista!), and yet it pulls off the meshing of influences brilliantly. Joe and Mick have some great vocal harmonies (listen to Spanish Bombs), and the horn section adds a level of sophistication to what is otherwise a four-piece rock band, hammering away with focus and energy.<br />While the Sex Pistols were nihilistic in their views, and the Ramones and the Damned just wanted to rock, The Clash were politically charged and idealistic in their lyrics. For instance, the haunting title track is about nuclear war, Clampdown is about Nazism, and Kola Kola mocks the corporate world. However the politicking never bogs down the songs, which are vital, aggressive, and fun. Rage Against The Machine could've learned a thing or two from these guys.<br />My favorites are the aforementioned tracks, and also The Guns Of Brixton, Lost In The Supermarket, Jimmy Jazz, Death Or Glory, the U.S. hit Train In Vain (Stand By Me), Brand New Cadillac, Four Horsemen, and the hilarious Wrong 'Em Boyo.<br />Although people listening for a straight-ahead punk album would be better served by buying The Clash's debut album, London Calling is absolutely essential to your collection. If you love rock in any subgenre, you'll find plenty to enjoy here.<br />------R.I.P Joe------
0140185232|4.0|First, a word of warning to the readers of the Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics edition of this book.  You may want to hold off on reading the introduction as Mr. Curtis reveals a plot point that might frustrate first-time readers of the book.  Now, onto the review.<br />The plot of The Razor's Edge is quite well-known and can be summed up as the quest of a young man to find himself.  I think many, if not most, people can identify with the peripatetic, searching nature of Larry Darrell.  Larry is burdened with some of the fundamental questions of life that we all have but, owing to a war-time experience and some independent financial means, he's unwilling to assume his place in a post WWI world until they're answered.  Larry interacts with several characters throughout the book over the span of several decades.  All of the characters are well-developed and the writing is good on a fairly consistent basis.  As has been mentioned in previous reviews, there are a few occasions where the details provided by the author have the effect of slowing down an otherwise brisk pace.  The frank depiction of sexuality in the book somewhat surprised me given the publication date of this work.<br />In the end, I recommend the book as an enjoyable and often funny exploration of clearly defined human archetypes (i.e.  the superficial, the introspective, etc.).  I've awarded the book 4 stars because of the detail-laden aspects of some of the book and also because the ending seemed somewhat forced to me.  While the summation of the characters provided in the conclusion was quite pithy, the overall effect of the last chapter was to leave me with a sense of having been rushed.  As such, it didn't live up to the otherwise high standards set by the book. Nonetheless, The Razor's Edge is deserving of your time.
B000021Y77|3.0|This movie explores the variations that affect our day.  Most of the time, small changes wouldn't mean much.  But, when life is on the line, one small change can have a profound impact on the following decisions, events, and coincidents.  This movie is brave enough to show them, taking a page from Rashomon, which shows the same events from 3 different perspectives.<br />However, where this movie lost me was caring for the characters.  The boyfriend whose life is on the line is a gangster, a drug dealer.  Why would I care if he lives or dies?  So he can poison the youth later on?<br />Overall, the DVD is average.  There's not many extras, but it is a 2-sided DVD that has both widescreen and full-screen versions (for those of you that like to miss 40% of the movie).  This movie may worth a watch, not much more.
B00004YA0T|5.0|Anton Bruckner has often been accused of writing the same symphony over and over again until he finally got it right toward the end of his life. While this is certainly an overstatement, there is a definate similarity between Bruckner symphonies that is remarkably consistent throughout his output. He always puts the same syle of movement in the same places (Opening movement, slow movement, scherzo, finale), uses the same formal procedures (rather than the traditional 1st theme/2nd theme/codetta of sonata allegro form, Bruckner masses several themes into a first theme group/second theme group/third theme group), an organists approach to orchestration dominated by massive blocks of sound rather than impressionistic effect. These hallmarks of Bruckner's style span his entire life and output, making him one of the most consistent composers in the repertoire. As a result, if you love one Bruckner symphony, you'll probably love them all. And visa versa.<br />I fall into the love category. Bruckner's symphonies are marvelous romantic edifices. At his best, Bruckner can storm heaven and plumb the depths of the psyche in equal measure. They are primarily spiritual testimonies, monuments to Bruckner's rather simple faith. All of them are worth a listen, and some of them are true masterpieces (4th, 7th, 8th, and 9th and maybe the 6th as well.)<br />I judge my Bruckner symphony cycles by the readings I hear of the 7th and 8th. The 7th is a marvel of symphonic writing. It's first theme soars out of the orchestra like the Grail theme of Parsifal, but with more power in my opinion. Each iteration of the theme should gather in intensity until the last one leaves you breathless. I have only heard this done supremely twice, once in a recording of a Furtwangler radio broadcast, and once in this reading by Jochum. Both conductors seem to be preternaturally in tune with Bruckner's aestetic and listening to the 7th is a spiritual experience.<br />The 8th comes from the opposite spiritualrealm. The Eighth is initially a tragic symphony. The first movement builds to a grindingly tragic conclusion and the tension developed isn't resolved until the final bars of the piece. It is an overwhelming work. Jochum's is by far the best reading of this piece I've ever heard, even trumping the Furtwangler readings I know.<br />Jochum is supreme in all of this repertoire. He made his reputation as a Bruckner specialist, and you can hear his deep love of the composer in every measure. Jochum brings the same level of committment to the &quot;lesser&quot; symphonies like the 2nd and 3rd. Under his hand, I find that I like these works much better than I thought I did. I turn to them more than I did before buying this set, though I still spend most of the time with the great works.<br />If you are interested in the complete Bruckner symphonies this is the set to have. It beats the competition hands down. If you just want a sampling of Bruckner, I would still highly recommend Jochum's accounts. No other conductor, even Gunther Wand who has made such a splash in Bruckner circles, can touch Jochum in his sensitivity and ability to keep a forward line through this challenging repertoire.
6305232660|3.0|Having been released just 8 weeks apart in the early summer of 1998, \\"Deep Impact\\" and \\"Armageddon\\" are inexorably linked (\\"Deep Impact\\" was released first).  Since they are both cosmic-object-threatens-Earth stories that invoved huge ad-hoc NASA missions to bore holes and drop nukes, it just makes sense.  Oh, yea, and New York gets trashed in each movie, too.  However, the films are are essentially flip-sides of each other.<br />This might sound sexist, but it is fairly easy to tell that this movie was directed by a female (Mimi Leder).  To quote a previous reviewer, \\"This is a great SF movie by a woman director who focuses on the emotional aspects rather than the hero dynamics.\\"  While Jerry Bruckheimer certainly acheived the hero dynamic with his testosterone-laden \\"Aramgeddon\\", Mimi Leder's \\"Deep Impact\\" attempted to hit the emotional mark, but just about completely missed it.<br />Although, refreshingly, one can watch this movie without totally suspending one's concept of reality, as is required with \\"Armageddon\\", there is still the feeling that something isn't quite right with this film.  The elements are certainly here, such as Morgan Freeman's unremarkable, but dignified protrayal of the President.  The biggest problem is that the movie tries to set up the emotional moments in the various storylines, but then never really delivers them.<br />If \\"Armageddon\\" was an overdose of amphetamines, the \\"Deep Impact\\" was certainly a large quantity of Valium.  The epitome of this was Tea Leoni, whose playing of a news reporter was remarkably void of any real humanity whatsoever apart from a feeble attempt at the end.  As a matter of fact, she gave a complete sense of detachment, which I'm sure was the opposite of what was intended.<br />None of the other principals did anything to overcome this, except for Robert Duval, who was the veteran astronaut proving that old dogs can indeed learn new tricks, but even so, it was too little, too late.  It is just about impossibleto really connect with either the story or characters.  It's akin to the soft-spoken announcer of a chamber music radio station trying to describe a riot; it just doesn't work.<br />\\"Deep Impact\\" composer James Horner, who did a masterful job with the music of \\"Titanic\\", unfortunately misses the mark, too.  \\"Titanic\\" fans will find a lot of familiarity in the film score, as some of the themes bear a striking resemblance to James Cameron's epic.  The music here though, instead of reinforcing the emotions (as it did in \\"Titanic\\") seems to further add to the sense of detachment.  This is suprising, being a James Horner score, but it didn't fit in very well.<br />Despite it's faults, and they're big ones, there is still a lot to like about \\"Deep Impact\\".<br />In last half-hour of the film, things actually start getting a little interesting hour of calamity arrives.  There is action without overblown antics.  The special effects are all tastefully done and reasonably realistic, which is refreshing to the heavy-handed ones in \\"Armageddon\\".  The comet of \\"Deep Impact\\" looks like it should, just merrily Hale-Bopping along and minding it's own business (until Earth just wanders into its path).  This is opposed to the \\"Armageddon\\" astroid's actively stalking, menacing appearance.  I am admittedly no expert on tsunamis, but the one in this film seems to be the most realistic one I've seen.  The explosions are kept to a minimum, and makes it all the more believeable.<br />Although nowhere near the magnitude of the whoppers in \\"Armageddon\\" there are a few technical errors worth noting:<br />- The comet certainly looks a *lot* bigger than it's advertised size (7 miles) in the landing and drilling scenes.<br />- Exactly how was the comet's initial path calculated based on a single picture?<br />- Those familiar with the lay of the land in New York City probably realize that the only way the wave could hit where it did was for it to have originated in NEW JERSEY and not the actualocean.<br />- The part of the comet that impacted in the Atlantic did so while moving east at a high velocity.  How could that produce such a powerful westbound wave?
B00006CXXU|5.0|Much like Janet Jackson's \\"Control\\", Pink's \\"Missundastood\\" and to a lesser degree, Britney Spears' \\"Britney\\", Christina Aguilera's latest release, \\"Stripped\\", is a declaration of independence and adulthood.  <br />The initial release from the album, \\"Dirrty\\", is not an indication of the quality of music on the release.  \\"Dirrty\\" is merely a pop vehicle designed to grab the attention of those who have forgotten that Christina is still around.  It does assert Christina's sexuality, more pointedly in the video, but that theme is limited to this one particular song. The album doesn't suffer because of its inclusion, but it doesn't really raise the level of quality either.  That duty is left to some of the standout tracks that will probably be unable to find a home on Pop radio.<br />The lyrics are phenomenal on most of the tracks.  It shows a return to true writing, which hasn't been heard of from a pop artist in ages.  Read the lyrics of \\"Walk Away\\", and you find yourself wondering is Christina talking about a person, or something more sinister?  The very next track has a totally different feel.  Instead of feeling helpless on \\"Walk Away,\\" \\"Fighter\\" talks about gratitude toward that which she was walking away from, making her stronger and wiser.<br />Primer Amor and Infatuation show off a Latin-influenced soul that surfaced on the previous album's remix of \\"What a Girl Wants\\".  <br />The styles continue to change so often, that Christina often makes you forget that she began as a typical pop star.  Sample \\"Make Over\\" and the horn section on \\"Underappreciated\\" and she proves herself to be less formulaic, and more diverse in the choices that she has made in the music that she's making.<br />One of my favorites, which will never make it to the radio, is \\"Cruz\\".  Starting a capella and slowly building into a great mid-tempo ballad, it reminds me of 70's style song writing.  Uncomplicated and easy to sing along to.  The current hit, \\"Beautiful\\" is just that.  The melody iswonderful, and the words are very insightful.  It reminds me of \\"Unpretty\\", but doesn't try to mimic it at all.<br />Perhaps the best song on the album is \\"I'm Ok\\".  It tells a sad story of Christina's childhood, with parental fighting, and the effects that it had on Christina.  Much love for her mother, much pain stemming from her father, but she declares that she's OK.<br />There are a few over-the-top numbers, such as \\"The Voice Within\\", which has a Whitney Houston/Mariah Carey influence.  It's not a terrible thing.  It's actually a great song, and one that will probably hit the airwaves soon.<br />Overall, this is a very good release, and one that should not be ignored.
B00005QIPH|1.0|...when a band of five completely untalented prep school boys with industry connections (via a rich fashion mogul father) can get rave reviews and become internationally famous for poorly and unenthusiastically aping the styles of good bands from 30 years ago.  these kids are not rock and roll.  these kids wouldn't know rock and roll if it was dropped on their heads.  what has happened to us that our expectations are this low?  everyone says \\"well they're not original, and they won't change your life, but they play good rock and roll.\\"  well, i can think of tons of bands that make a lot less money and get a lot less attention that ARE original and that COULD change your life.  the ONLY reason anyone knows who these bourgeois jerks are is that one of them has a rich, connected daddy.  period.  mediocre to poor all around.  let's hope they all die of drug overdoses soon.

0807282375|1.0|First, I have 5 children aged 13 to 20 who, for the most part, love to read. They do not, however, like to start a series before the author has completed the last book (the Harry Potter series is driving them crazy while they wait for the next book) and I frequently find myself reading a series to let them know if it is worth the time. I read the first two books in the series as they came out and found the characters intriguing but the treatment of religion rather heavy handed. Still, it is a fantasy and characters are subject to extreme interpretation.<br />When I came to this book, The Amber Spyglass, I saw the gloves come off and the author exposed the series for what it really is, a bully pulpit for his hatred of organized religion, particularly the catholic church. I am not catholic and do not subscribe to their beliefs but I find Pullman's stance offensive. Ironically, I tend to agree with some of his complaints about the church, but a series of books for young adults is not the appropriate place to sow seeds of hate. Make no mistake, that is what comes through loud and clear. The author hates and wants the reader to share his feelings. The fact that he tells a good story makes this perversion of the media all the more objectionable. I feel cheated and wish I had not spent good money to support this hateful message.
B00006BTCA|5.0|People all over this review board are going nutty trying to figure out whether or not this album is too derivative of Joy Division to be any good.  Even some of the 5-star reviewers seem to be apologizing for Interpol's sound.<br />All that malarky ends right here.<br />Admittedly, I too had some marvelous flashbacks to old favorite bands when I first played this record, but it had little to do with Joy Division at all.  I thought more of early-90's-era Cure, even had some flashes of Tragically Hip....but what happened far and away above that is that I found that I was, in fact, ENJOYING LISTENING TO THIS RECORD WITHOUT ALL THE COMPARISONS.<br />Anyone who compares Joy Division to Interpol is already weilding a flawed argument, in my opinion, simply because Joy Division - seriously now people - WAS NOT A GOOD BAND in terms of the sum of its parts.  I grant you with all good faith that New Order (the band that emerged after Ian Curtis died) made some champion albums; I mean, I got into Movement bigtime, and yes I do think they were a little bit ahead of their time. Way to go, New Order.  However, Joy Division was always just a little bit flawed by the presence of Ian Curtis.  I hate to burst anyone's bubble or spit in the starry eyes of those who are devout Curtis fans, but comparing these two voices simply does not compute given the fact that one singer - Interpol's - can carry a tune and the other - Ian Curtis - COULD NOT. I am sorry but the truth will both set you free, and likely save you from bothering with all that eyeliner on weekends at the club.<br />I have personally enjoyed this album more than any other that has come out in the past couple of years, though I do have to say they have yet to take over the rank of my personal favorite (currently enjoyed by The Shins, whose record &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; should be heard by all)...however Interpol is still a great listen and is for the moment at least monopolizing my stereo completely. And there's little doubt in my mind about whether or not Interpol sounds like Joy Division....all you need is a simple tuning fork to disprove that theory.
B00000JPH6|3.0|A shattered dark crystal holds the fate to an almost extinct species called the Gelflings.  The Skeksis another race are bent on the Gelflings destruction and will stop at nothing.  It is the prophecy that a Gelfling will merge the crystal shard and destroy the Skeksis.  The plot of this movie was pretty deep and good.  One thing the movie lacked was humans.  It's not that I am being prejudice, but I really had a hard time relating to the charcters because they weren't human.  So I sat through 94 min. movie not really caring what was going on.  The length of the movie may have had something to do with it as well.  Henson may have tried to tackle to big of a plot and not enough time to really do much with it.  I highly recommend just renting this movie.
B00004XQP4|2.0|The best song on this album (\\"Misery\\") is almost a carbon copy of Tom Waits' \\"Rain Dogs\\" from the album of the same name.  The music, the \\"Well, well\\" part, everything, is taken from the earlier song.<br />And these Berkeley boys aren't punk.  As far as I'm concerned, punk lasted for a few years back in the late 70s.  Green Day has made some decent \\"Alternative Rock\\" in the past, but you won't find that here.  Buy Wire's 1977 album \\"Pink Flag\\" for good authentic punk.
B00005OAIE|1.0|Mayer is brutal.  He has no unique style or talent.  He has attempted to copy the style of Dave Matthews and is very unsuccessful.  His lack of guitar talent and terrible lyrics doesn't even compare him to the DMB!
B000002UB3|5.0|Come on, what can I say. It's the final masterpeice from the greatest musical romance in music history. Every song on here is great and the album is very coherant and touches on every element of The Beatles diverse style. I personally love &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot; straight through to &quot;The End&quot;. Enough has been said about The Beatles so I don't need to remind people of their importance in popular culture, although they always deserve what credit they get. But this is their final album and it is timeless and will always be one of my favorites.<br />If you are a fan of good music, and like good albums, you should have no reason for not owning this.
0060537639|4.0|This is an intriguing exercise in speculative history. Gavin Menzies, a throwback to the days of the Victorian amateur historian, has produced a massive work of speculation and imagination.  In brief, the former Royal Navy submarine commander believes that the Ming treasure ship voyages of the 1420s went much further than the African, Indian, and Middle Eastern ports they are supposed to have visited.  Menzies claims evidence that Admiral Zheng He and his fellow eunuch admirals explored most of the world, in the process creating maps that were the basis for the later explorations of Columbus, Da Gama, and other Europeans.<br />I enjoyed this book.  Menzies' enthusiasm is contagious, and I especially enjoyed his reminiscences of his own submarine visits to some of the ports he claims the Chinese visited.  But in the cold light of day, I have to say that his theory isn't supported.  Time after time he makes bold statements, then has to say that he was refused permission to make the final tests that would prove his ideas, or that the data wasn't ready in time for the hard cover edition, or that more information is to be published on his website.  Well, why didn't he delay the book a year or so in order to get the proof he claims he has included? Another problem I have is Menzies' claim that all of this Chinese exploration took place in just a few years time in the 1420s.  Frankly, I think his theory would be much stronger if he had claimed some sort of long term Chinese sea exploration project.  Finally, in all this travelling around that the treasure ships are supposed to have done, why didn't any visit Europe?  It seems awfully careless of Admiral Zheng He (who was a truly redoubtable fellow, read Louise Levathes' When China Ruled The Seas for more material on him)to have neglected to visit a continent with a significant number of literate, urbanized areas ripe for trade. (The Chinese knew where Europe was, they hade been in contact for fifteen hundred years or so.)<br />So, I have a very positive impression of Gavin Menzies and I appreciate his enthusiasm and his certainty, however I can only recommend 1421 as an engaging and entertaining work of speculation.br />So, I have a very positive impression of Gavin Menzies and I appreciate his enthusiasm and his certainty, however I can only recommend 1421 as an engaging and entertaining work of speculation.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is not just any old cd by any old band.  If you spend some quality time listening to this cd, i mean really listening, not just having it on in the background while you drive or anything, but really listening, you'll see why people are so obsessed with this album.  There's no describing it, except to say that it pierces right down to the soul of any person who opens their heart to it.  Buy it, listen to it, trust me, youll understand.

0688156819|5.0|I first received a copy of this book in 1999 as a gift. I had always loved Tim Burton so this gift served as a great addition to any fan's collection. I enjoyed this book so much and actually recommended it to all my friends. This last Christmas, I actually bought it for a friend of mine and he in turn loved it. It contains dark humoured poetry accompanied by grotesquely lovable characters who you immediately care for. I recommend this book to anyone who loves their dark comedies and Tim Burton.
B00000IMTH|5.0|Sadly, Long Live Rock 'n' Roll was the last album to feature Ronnie James Dio, he left Rainbow in order to replace Ozzy Osbourne in Black Sabbath to record two studio albums and one live album. The title track should've been a rock 'n' roll anthem like Deep Purple's Smoke on the Water (guitarist Ritchie Blackmore's previous band) and Woman From Tokyo, Black Sabbath's Paranoid and Iron Man and Kiss's Rock and Roll All Nite. This album is an underrated classic, Lady of the Lake is another sing along classic, L.A. Connection could've been another song by ELF but by any means it's a good song, Gates of Babylon is a haunting track, Kill the King is another classic by Rainbow with a pounding drum solo by the late great Cozy Powell, The Shed (Subtle) is a real badass song with a blues intro. Sensitive to Light is a decent song, but not up to early Rainbow's standards. And the orchestral ballad Rainbow Eyes which is a beautiful masterpiece, Ronnie James Dio sings beautifully on this song and it deserves more recognition than what it gets. <BR>Also unfortunately, Rainbow never seemed to earned the multi-platinum success that they truly deserved but all we know is that us classic rock/metal fans will always remember how good Rainbow is with Ronnie James Dio.<BR>If you want to own a Rainbow album, get this album, Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow and Rainbow Rising, avoid those other albums unless you're a diehard Rainbow fan. I didn't think that Rainbow was that great when they were compeeting bands like Starship, Boston or Journey, they should've been on par with Black Sabbath, UFO and Deep Purple (The Ian Gillan era, of course).
0767849493|4.0|No one can be surprised at the complaints folks have about the movie, given that it touches on sensitive subjects and that Kevin Smith is not known for his subtlety.  But I would ask everyone who dislikes this movie if they can name another that unquestioningly acknowledges the benevolence of God or the importance of spiritual faith.  This film doesn't fret about God's existence, or emphasize Jesus' human fallibility like other, more serious-themed works that have offended folks in the same fashion.  Furthermore, I know of no cinematic portrayal of God that shows His love for humanity and the universe better than Dogma does (and I can think of maybe one better way that the concept of Hell has been expressed).  Sure, the film is over the top, and intented to be that way, but that should be no surprise coming from Kevin Smith.  Ultimately, the questions and beliefs that the characters express are important ones, and the answers put forth are undeniably good ones.
B00005AREQ|5.0|This CD is a classic, I mean before then I wasn't really into instrumental rock but when I first heard Freeway Jam on a digital station, I quickly fell in love with it and it was Jeff Beck's first gold record. It begins with You Know What I Mean, another Jeff Beck classic, She's a Woman was originally done by the Beatles, Constipated Duck is the shortest track on this CD, AIR Blower is a classic headbanging tune and it's a good song to listen to when you feel down about yourself, Scatterbrain kind of has the vein to AIR Blower, Cause We've Ended as Lovers is a beautiful instrumental with an excellent guitar solo, Thelonious is a decent track but nothing really special, the FM staple Freeway Jam is easily the best song on this album, and remember he was one of Aerosmith's idols, Diamond Dust is a beautiful masterpiece clocking in at over 8 minutes long.<BR>If you love instrumental rock or classic rock, then you should get this album cause they don't make music the way they used to and I wish that they did.....Highly Recommended.<br />Also Jeff Beck was also a member of the Yardbirds as well as the project band Beck Bogert Appice.
0553573403|5.0|Rarely have I been more riveted to a book.  I even dreamed about the characters when I'd put it down for the night.  Martin's world is vividly frescoed across his epic tale.  This is a high fantasy in its complexity, but grittily realistic in its medieval setting.<br />I was impressed by Martin's restraint.  He doesn't linger on any topic gratuitously as so many authors are prone to do.  Sex scenes, war scenes, love scenes, and descriptions will never make you groan, as they are all described with just the perfect portion of words.<br />There is a character in this book for anyone to relate to.  My particular favorite were Jon Snow - the Stark [guy] who pledges himself to the austere life on the Night's Watch, a near-monastic order that guards a Hadrian-like wall from the savageries of the  north.  I also enjoyed the tomboyish Arya - a noble-born girl who learns to swordfight with or without her father's permission.<br />I am not one for battle scenes, but I enjoyed this in this book.  Also, complex politics can bore me in a fantasy novel, but they are so well-done that I enjoyed these sections as well.  Normally, if a book has a chapter on each character as this one does, I will dislike some characters and want to skip their chapters.  However, each character's story is so interesting in its own way that I didn't want to do that this time.<br />In short, read it.

B000069AUI|5.0|I was doubtful that Coldplay could release anything that would possibly equate to their astounding PARACHUTES debut, but RUSH OF BLOOD has proven me wrong.  At first listen I found it much more mellow than the previous album (though similarly seductive), yet with each new listen, it gets better and better - and, hey, Coldplay IS mellow music most times.  RUSH OF BLOOD  stands along-side of PARACHUTES as a near equal. The album opens with POLITIK with a memorable, off-key chord and social-consciousness haunting chrous of &quot;Open up your eyes&quot;.  IN MY PLACE - the first radio release - is a catchy, YELLOW-ish tune, another singalong anthem that will stay with you for years.  A real standout is track 3 - GOD PUT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE - with the very memorable chord progression of the upbeat chorus.  The next track, THE SCIENTIST, is a beautiful, slow ballad that takes even a simple phrase &quot;Nobody said it was easy&quot; to new emotional heights - you can almost hear the Beatles' HEY JUDE buildup in this song to the point which you may almost be singing your own &quot;nah-nah0-nah-na-na-na-na&quot; at the end.  CLOCKS, the second release from this album, is a very catchy, piano driven arpeggio progression.  DAYLIGHT also reminded me a bit of the Beatles, maybe in their later, Eastern-influenced era.  Two other *excellent* tracks on this album are WARNING SIGN (this one nearly breaks my heart now with its wistful &quot;But the truth is, I miss you&quot; post-breakup reflections - again, don't let the simplicity of the lyrics fool you - wait til you HEAR it nearly cried out to you) and the title track, A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD, the lyrics of which echo sentiments of loss and time passed and mistakes made - with a very touching chorus as well.  This album has a LOT to discovery and offers up more with each new listen.  If you did not have the joy of discovering Coldplay with PARACHUTES, get both albums now!  And if you were as moved by PARACHUTES as I was, youwill not be disappointed with RUSH OF BLOOD - its stands on its own as another masterpiece.
B0000024Z7|5.0|I have to agree with the customer reviewer who says, in Caravanserai Carlos is at his apex. And conversely, I have to disagree with the guy who thinks this albumn represents a step down in greatness, when compared to the first three Santanas. <BR>  <BR>I don't know why it is, but whenever an artist goes into another direction, good or bad, he will inevitably have his detractors who insist that he remain stagnant, churning out the same stuff over and over again. Don't get me wrong, I love all of the first three albumns, but in Santana's third, as much as I like it, we already see a good degree of repetition. Caravanserai, on the other hand, is definitely a departure into a new direction. Maybe this record should have been titled \\"Welcome\\", because it was a welcomed change into a new territory and to new sounds, while still exploding here and there with enough of the familiar energy to satisfy the sentimentalists.    <br />Caravanserai is Carlos' most under-appreciated recoding; probably because the length of the pieces didn't lend themselves to standardized radio-industry 3 minute time slots; and maybe because these tunes don't try to fit into the easy-to-digest pop formula. Instead, here Carlos takes big steps forward, elevating his music to the next level; progressing and growing. But all that aside, basically what really matters to me is that I like it, without having to disect it to know why. For me it's all about complexity and about simplicity together and all at once. It's about the complexities of creative genius, about undefinable and unqualifiable criterion necessary to make art, and yet irrelevant to me in appreciating it. This is my favorite Santana; when he was still moving forward. Maybe one day he will again.
B000002952|5.0|Mi Tierra is such a special, sincere, romantic and most of all a very Cuban album. In the market now for 10 years and still has its musical magic comparable to the first time that I listened to this production. No doubt this is one of her most complete albums and perhaps her best in the category of tropical music. Gloria Estefan has always been a renowned singer in English and if I am not mistaken Mi Tierra is her first Spanish album and who would of thought that it would be so successful. This cd has various Cuban rhythms like son, traditional, boleros and salsa. The album has 12 songs in total and they are all wonderful. Once you start listening to the album there will be no need to stop. The first song will really coax you into listening to the rest of the recording. It's a very romantic bolero and at the same time very inspiring and well sung by Gloria which will leave you motivated to listen to the rest of the songs. There are very danceable ones such as the forever popular \\"Mi Tierra\\" as well as 'Ayer\\" and \\"Hablemos el mismo idioma\\". Mi Tierra is one of those albums that has no time frame because the songs will live forever and this music has no boundaries. It's for anyone who knows how to appreciate the beauty that it has to offer. I hope Gloria produces more Spanish albums. I think she was born to sing in her native language! Try to ascertain a copy while you can. This is wonderful tribute to Spanish music, people and culture! Arriba Cuba!
B0000797IO|1.0|When you hear the buzz about Jennifer Aniston's performance in \\"The Good Girl\\", you just expect that the vehicle will be worthwhile, as well. Both assumptions are a mistake.<br /><br /> The \\"buzz\\" is about Jennifer playing against type; not only non-comedic, non-romantic, but also non-interesting. I've never been able to recognize why Jennifer would be any better or more deserving of an Emmy than the other two women \\"Friends\\", and this role does not change my mind about her. Hollywood wants to make her a star, an award-winner; it's not about the talent or the choices she makes, it's just about the golden image.<br /><br />She's fine in \\"The Good Girl\\". Yup, you can believe that Justine is quietly desperate to end a dull marriage to a pothead and a dead-end job. What you can't believe is how she ever got herself in the position she's in, in the first place. Justine seems to accept all the lackluster characters around her, from her co-workers (\\"the Bible Study guy\\", Gwen the optimist, and the strange young girl who takes Gwen's place and performs acts of cosmetic terror behind the makeup counter) to the man she married, (the capable John C. Reilly, who has exactly \\"0\\" chemistry with Miss Aniston) to his odd little pothead friend (Tim Blake Nelson as Bubba). No attempt to flesh out her character or attitude by understanding her childhood is made here.<br /><br />It is believable that she would begin an affair with someone different, Tom, (he likes to call himself Holden), a young, troubled and aimless ex-alcoholic from town, who still lives with his mom and dad. Jake Gyllenhaal is the object of her affections, but frankly, there's no chemistry in this relationship, either.<br /><br />What is impossible to understand is why she would choose such a moody young thing, and callously and quickly determine to end the relationship when she finally, finally recognizes what a child he is. Impossible to believe how she could dump her friend Gwen with a life threatening illness at the door of a hospital, and never go back. Or, how she could possibly make such a deal with the devil (Bubba) when he explains to her WHY he needs to sleep with her.<br /><br />Why is it called \\"The Good Girl\\"? There's nothing good about Justine, including Aniston's accent...really a waste of 90 minutes of your time.the door of a hospital, and never go back.

B00006690H|5.0|This is definelty one of the best cd's ever. I like almost every song. The skits aren't so good but the songs make up for them. So if you like music at all I have two words for you \\" BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\"
B00005JLEU|5.0|I have to rate this five stars, despite the eco-babble plot, because the artistry is overwhelming.  Miyazaki's \\"Spirited Away\\" is fine art.  Disney's marketing strategy worked just fine, as far as I can tell -- that is, limited release, followed by limited release even unto Des Moines, Iowa, rewarding expected behavior by animeniacs, followed by release to DVD.  Excellent.  This is literally like owning an original Picasso, and as the shelf life of Disney's chosen DVD surface media gradually erodes over the next 0.5 decades or so, the few surviving copies may even accumulate fiduciary, as well as superbly aesthetic, value.  The plot is typical Miyazaki ecology maunderings; if you could stand it in Mononoke Hime, you can stand it in Sen to Chihiro.  It's a minor defect, what Hitchcock used to call the \\"McGuffin.\\"
0553801511|5.0|If you are reading this review, you are probably thinking of buying this book.  If you have enjoyed Hobb's previous work, you will love this one.  If you have not read the first three books in the Farseer Trilogy, do so before you read the Tawny Man Series.  I am not saying you can not appreciate this book without having read the earlier ones, but reading in order will give you a special appreciation.<br />What makes this book so great is that while it has magic and sword play and horses and castles, it is also one of the few fantasy books to have more than one psychologically real character.  All the main characters are \\"realistic\\" in the sense that they are motivated by a variety of impulses and desires.  No character is flat or stereotypical.   There are also multiple plots that relfect on one another, and yet the characters are so distinctive there is no chance any reader will get lost.  The first person narrative is also well done.  There is enough dramatic irony that we see Tom's strengths and weaknesses and can judge his judegments from our own perspective.  <br />This is a great book and very well written.  If you like George R R Martin, I think you will especially appreciate this book.  This books is better written than the Jordan material, which I much enjoy, and way way above the average fantasy trash.<br />Thank you, Robin Hobb!   And get to work on number 3, please!!
B00003CXXM|1.0|Like I say, I guess it serves me right for renting a movie like this in the first place.<br />See, Bourne is found by a bunch of Mediterranean-type fishermen, floating in the sea with a few bullets in him, plus a mini laser embedded in his thigh which, when cut out and turned on by the fishing boat's answer to Bones McCoy, displays a scanning-laser-written bank name, location and account number.  Kind of a lot of trouble to go to for information that could be more compactly stored on a folded piece of plastic, but I guess those guys at the CIA know what they're doing, right?  I mean, to judge from this movie, most of their crack staff appears to be about 17 years old.  You know, there's the kid in the home office who's coming on all seasoned about what blown agents normally do in situations like Bourne's.  I was thinking maybe he should've finished off his curriculum at Varsity High and got his diploma before he was recruited by the CIA, but what do I know.  And then there's his prom date, the girl who's stationed in Paris and acts like she's real competent and hardboiled while she looks like she should be popping pimples on her chin and worrying about taking her driving test.  I mean, do they take us for complete dundering [people]?  Apparently so.  Like in the scene where the CIA section head gives a boiler room pep-talk to the staff about Bourne's whereabouts.  He says, \\"He's located... here\\" and he puts a red push pin into a small map of France, pushing it into the place where Paris would be.  Hey, thanks, chief.  That's a big help.  Right after this he gives the assembled twelve year olds some rah rah BS and says, \\"I wan't you to get everybody up, up, get them all up we got to move, up, up\\" and as he says this he bodily hoists a corpulent black man to his feet.  It is clear from the man's expression that he has no idea why he is being brought to his feet or what he is supposed to do.<br />But anyway, back to Bourne.  So Bourne, when he comes to on the fishing boat with the swarthy sailors, he don't remember nothing, see.  Got amnesia from those bullets in his back or something.  Now, time out for a second here.  Raise your hand if you have ever in your life known anyone who has ever had amnesia.  Right, just as I thought.  If it weren't for hack writing, we'd never even know the condition existed.  But to judge from movies if you were to walk into a room and do eeny meeny miny moe every third guy wouldn't know his own name.  Its a real scourge of our time, this amnesia.  Just like multiple personality disorder - what is usually totally erroneously referred to as schizophrenia.  Yeah, it seems that psychiatrists working in nut farms will rarely come across one legit case of MPD in twenty years.  But I guess if they were working in tinseltown, they'd find the disease as common as grass.<br />Well, not to worry, Matt Damon gets a clean bill of health in that regard.  No trace of any heterogenous personality emanations.  He's the same drink of water he always is, and about as colorful and interesting.<br />But, meanwhile, back on the fishing boat, you see these swarthy foreign sailors unaccountably have a soft spot for American-sounding guys with a bunch of lead and laserbeams in them and not the slightest clue.  But as Bourne explains, his habits have stayed with him.  And indeed, before our eyes he begins doing pull-ups from the mainsail or whatever.  I guess for him doing pull-ups is like a reflex action.  Funny.  I do my fair share of pull-ups and I always have to force myself.  Note to Hollywood writer: exertion does not come natural.  But anyway, so this Rocky-esque training sequence on the fishing boat was real inspiring though.  They really should have developed it more, like with Matt Damon clad in a sweat suit running laps around the tiny ship, then working out by punching the [heck] out of the freshly netted fish, till they all fall out of the net, right back into the drink with the fishermen all looking admiringlyon.  Thought bubble for random fisherman: \\"And to think he doesn't even know who the frig he is.\\"  Real inspiring.  Goosebumps.  Actually, I wish I could somehow arrange to get hit on the head in just such a way as to make me forget this movie.  Now that kind of amnesia I could get right down and dig.Thought bubble for random fisherman: \\"And to think he doesn't even know who the frig he is.\\"  Real inspiring.  Goosebumps.

B00004Z459|5.0|See, for a long time now I've had a huge problem when anyone asks what my favorite album is. Do I say \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", giving the vote to Dylan's pained songwriting? What about \\"Pet Sounds\\", with Brian Wilson and co.'s aching harmony expressing the fear and sadness of a generation? Or should it be the 'Mats \\"Let it Be\\"? Well, thanks to \\"Hybrid Theory\\" I don't need to pick, because it blows all of those albums out of the water!!! It's that good!!! I swear they must have Dylan ghostwriting these lyrics; they have a very Dylanesque feel. Anyhow, if you don't own this you are like the biggest square in the world. What are you waiting for? Everyone else says it's good, so it must be. Oh, and by the way...when that person said that \\"Crawling\\" was the most beautiful song ever I almost threw up in my mouth.
0375414053|4.0|I find it interesting that this book has elicted such positive and negative reviews from moms.  I truly think most of the humour in this book is meant to be tongue-in-cheek, it's just too over the top to be taken so seriously.  Whether you have been a full/part time working mom, or a stay-at-home one, who of us has not felt guilt about whether we were being the best mother to our children.  Maternal angst goes with the job of motherhood.  The anger directed toward this book seems to be focused on the fact that \\"Kate\\" didn't have to work, had nannys and cleaning women and was still struggling. As mother's we all have different stories, and while certainly not the most common scenario, this is just one of many.  Good mothers come in all manner of packages, as do bad (remember Jack's comment about his stay-at-home mom that played bridge and drank martini's all day?)  This book is a quick, funny and poignant read.  No, it's certainly not indicative of most women's motherhood experience, but remember.... it's fiction!
0553801511|5.0|*Spoilers contained*<br />I've read her farseer and liveship series and am eagerly awaiting the next book after golden fool. Why are her books virtually unheard of? Is it lack of marketing? I don't understand.<br />I loved this book. I even read and re-read a certain part of it (if you've read it you'll know which part i'm talking about). Although this series isn't propelled forwards at breakneck speed like the farseer trilogy, it is because the character is older and less hotheaded than he was as the 15 year old in that trilogy. For those of you who read the farseer trilogy with the terrible dread that fitz would die from poisoning/beating/drowning/exhaustion/battle/heartbreak/forging/skilling/hanging/freezing/gangrene/torture or something, you can breath a sigh of bittersweet relief, because in this book, at one point, something that COULD be perceived as GOOD (from a certain point of view) happens to FITZ! Woohoo! Way to go man! Finally the poor wretch actually gets a MOMENT of happiness.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I love the movies - the best ever made in my opinion. Funnily enough, even being a Tolkien fan I had to get 'used' to the First film when I saw it, however after a bit it couldn't be any other way. The music is real pretty, dark and threatening too. I am almost strictly into classical music and this I would put right up there with its beauty, complexity and harmony. In particular I like the Evenstar song as it has that otherworldly quality. The march of the ents also brings tremors through the system. There are not that many movies where the music does so much to the whole movie going experience. All the pieces can stand alone, and that is rare. I love it.
B000068PQ0|4.0|If this is representative of the Lip's sound, then it's a good sound. This album is replete with all kinds of digital effects, synthesizers, and the usual indie treated drumming, making a strange, delightful mix that's halfway between Aphex Twin and Genesis (the old Genesis that is). The musicianship is superb, with all the instrumental lines brilliantly balanced to form a cohesive whole. And the arrangements are stunningly complex and intricately woven together - something I haven't heard in a long time. And the lyrics? No corny pop junk here - the first song has lines such as \\"To lose I could accept, but to surrender I just wept and regretted this moment\\", and it only gets deeper from there on.<br />The first five songs flow into each other, making for a sort of \\"Concept\\" story about a girl who uses karate to destroy \\"evil-natured\\" robots. Kind of a cheezy plotline, but then so are most of the stories behind the concept albums of the seventies. But the really good songs are yet to come: songs like \\"Are You A Hypnotist??\\" and \\"Approaching Pavlonis...\\" are perfect showcases of wht this band can do. The drumming on \\"Are You???\\" is especially excellent. And this song also features a Mellotron, something to look for on future releases from this group.

B000001FS3|4.0|This is the ultimate U2 album. It's got everything: Rock anthems... ballads.... It has some of thier standout work and this is the album that really shot them to the top. It opens with \\"Where the streets have no name\\" (not a personal favorite, but still a good track) and then it comes to my favorite. \\"I still haven't found what I'm looking for\\" The song has a nice gospely feel to it, but it doesn't over do it on the preaching. \\"With or without you\\" is one of thier more misunderstood songs, but nevertheless it's enchanting and beautiful. The guitars are haunting and Bono's voice is in prime condition. Other standout tracks are \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" \\"Running to stand still\\" \\"God's Country\\" and \\"One Tree Hill.\\" If it weren't for the mis-step \\"Exit,\\" this would be, no doubt, a five star ambum.

There are so many interesting books out there -- why waste time reading about a high-strung, bored little rich girl?
B00004XPPC|5.0|1957's Bridge On The River Kwai is a stirring war film that is based on a novel that itself was inspired by real life events.  The movie stars William Holden and Alec Guinness as an American commander, Major Shears, and an English officer, Colonel Nicholson, respectively who are captives in a Japanese prisoner of war camp.  The camp is run by the heartless and maniacal Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) and he has been put in charge of constructing a railroad bridge over the river that will be extremely important to the Japanese war effort.  Saito and Nicholson are at constant odds over the British captives role in helping build the bridge.  Nicholson does not want to aid his enemies in such an important task and Saito uses abusive and sadistic means of punishment to try and break Nicholson, but due to Nicholson's high honor, he never gives in.  Eventually the men reach a compromise and Nicholson throws his men into task of building the bridge with a fervent and obsessive nature.  A parallel story line concerns Major Shears who escapes from the camp, makes an inspired trek through the dangerous jungle and finds his way back to a base in the South Pacific.  He provides the commanders with the information about the bridge, but his true motives are selfish as he wants to go home.  He is forced into volunteering to guide a British troop back into the jungle to the prisoner's camp to destroy the bridge.  Along on this mission is the leader Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) who is way too gung ho about it for Shears' liking.  The eventual intertwining of the two stories reaches a brilliant and rousing climax.  Director David Lean uses the jungle scenery of Sri Lanka to beautiful perfection to recreate the images of World War II.  He never resorts to gratuitous violence or mayhem , but expertly crafts a story about the psychological effects war has on three men who at first seem quite different, but in the end seem very much the same.  The film was a rousing success and dominated the 1957 Academy Awards winning a total seven including Best Picture, Mr. Lean's first Best Director Award and a truly deserving Best Actor Oscar for Sir Alec Guinness.he 1957 Academy Awards winning a total seven including Best Picture, Mr. Lean's first Best Director Award and a truly deserving Best Actor Oscar for Sir Alec Guinness.
B0000636UN|5.0|After reading the reviews of other customers, I was very surprised. I find the songs on this CD to be very real, full of emotion and definitley inspiring. Especially &quot;Diamond Road&quot;.  Her collaboration with other artists only make this CD better. Sheryl Crow has put together one of those albums that makes you want to memorize every lyric and sing along. I never realized what a talented artist she is and after purchasing this CD, I went out and bought every CD she's made.
0060090367|3.0|I was \\"wowed\\" when I read the editorial reviews.  I am a lover of all things Irish.  Therefore, I thought this book would delve into the stereotypical Irish lifestyle. You know, \\"Quiet Man\\" and such.   Not so, this could have taken place in New York anywhere.  Don't get me wrong, It was a very cute Romance, and the author's style is very funny.  I just thought that they would talk in funny accents and stuff.  I apologize for wanting this, but hey, I'm writing anonomously.  So those of you out there who love the Irish and Scottish romances, be forwarned.  She doesn't have a nice \\"cottage\\", there are no \\"running brooks\\" or \\"funny priests\\".  Gosh, I feel like an idiot, but when I read, I would like to totally escape.  I felt as though this book just took me next door.  I think the author needs to be a little more descriptive.  I can't even remember what her mother's house looks like, or any of the other places in the book.  Of course, this book started as a best-seller in Europe, so I guess they can do without stereotypes or descriptions, since they live there.  All in all, amusing from an emotional aspect, but definitely not what I was expecting.  I think I'll go back to my historical romances written by American authors.  They are much more escapist and romantic. I hate to be an idiot, thank goodness for the anonymous button.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|My all time favorite movie. Contains all the aspects of a good movie, deep, humorous, dark, creepy, clever. Very good story, great ending. This movie will make you think. If you liked movies such as \\"Pi\\" \\"A beautiful mind\\" and \\"American Beauty\\" you wont be disappointed. I seriously, have never met anyone who did not love this movie.
0316666343|5.0|This book is a great pick-me-up, a very insightful and uplifting story. The eloquence of the writing style as well as the story itself make it an intriguing experience. I loved every single page, every chapter, every word. I've been feeling fairly depressed lately for various reasons, and this book was exactly what I needed to give me hope and make me feel like someone, anyone, is watching out for me from above. I've read the last chapter 4 times already, and will probably keep reading this book over and over for a very long time. <br />...

It's not often that a simple children's book so accurately depicts the bond between a parent and child.

Killing them one by one, as if it's hunting them.<BR>A great cast heads a movie which never has a dull moment, and keeps you on the edge of your seat as you learn what the characters learn and are kept up to speed.<BR>This isn't a horror movie, but rather sci-fi action which can be said under the same breath as the origional ALIEN movie.<br />A great, fun movie that has a good sequel.  Not a great sequel, but a good one.
0375414053|3.0|There is so little interesting fiction written about the struggle working parents have I was hopeful for the read.  It's worth reading for the well-written paragraphs that do sum up a working woman's emotions about leaving a sick child, watching your baby cry as you leave and spending time away from family.  I also identified with her passion for her career and managing the home details.  Why is it so hard to understand that a woman can also WANT to work or not want to stay at home?  Her best writing was when she questioned the double standards in our society about mom/dad roles and what is expected.  How many of us have had to put up with the in-law remarks and all the double standards that come down so hard on women? Loved the analysis of stay at home moms as I have encountered all of those women and still don't understand why they hate women who work.  I will never understand why men aren't asked \\"Why don't you want to stay home and raise your kids?\\"    Agree with all the criticism from other reviews but guess I was so desperate to read about another working mum, I was willing to wade through the issues and applaud the good bits.  Would enjoy a male viewpoint.

B00006M183|5.0|I have read a lot of the reviews...heard a lot of the rhetoric. I will leave the discussions on their place in history to the scholars and the contentious. Pearl Jam is a great band let us not contest that. They influenced me greatly at a time when I was easy influenced (read h.s. and college). Well, I grew up, moved on...saw a few concerts in between, bought all the albums. No complaints. Let me tell you how this album differs...This is the first one in a long time to be in ultra heavy rotation and completely stimulate my every feeling. Stop reading and buy now if you understand this. Otherwise, know that somehow I think this album makes me feel younger yet wiser all at the same time. If you have ever been influenced by music, buy this album and listen carefully. You will not be disappointed for it is a dense collection of fashionable and sophisticated music with a perfect blend of challenging lyrics. btw, Love Boat Captain rulz!
B00000K3UU|5.0|No, it's actually a GOOD Adam Sandler movie! Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a law-school grad who has been milking an accident settlement to cover his living expenses, while he continues to slack his way through life. But when his girlfriend threatens to dump him, and then is doing the bad thing with an old guy. It is hysterical when he finds out, but before he finds that out, he decides to show her he's serious about their relationship and pretends to adopt a little boy in fact, his roommate's son from a one-night stand several years earlier, who shows up on their doorstep just after the roommate leaves town on a job. (Hence the Hooters joke) Big Daddy has its share of laughs and will certainly entertain fans who like Adam Sandler best when he plays the case of arrested development with a smart-aleck retort for everything. Buy or rent today, this movie is hilarious!
B00005OAIE|3.0|I couldn't help but notice the amazing rise of John Mayer, from unknown opening act, to international chart topper.  So it was with great interest that I sought out this album.  And, after listening to it a number of times, I must confess that I'm not quite sure what the hype is.  He does resemble the DMB (another band that seems to coast on similar themes album through album), though he does seem in infuse his acoustic-based pop songs with some jazzy twists.  He also is apparently a terrific guitar player, but I'm not sure it comes through so clearly on the album.  As far as profundity goes, it's seems that John Mayer has fallen far short of others (coming to mind are Howie Day's Australia, and Chance Gardener's Prove Yourself).  I think I'll stick to those...  Perhaps a new album will show a bit more range, depth, and identity.
B00005JKED|5.0|Possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen, with AMAZING performances by Paul Walker and Denzel. Once you see Walker in this movie, you'll be saying \\"the fast and the what?\\". While I previously LOATHED Denzel for his constantly corny performances, he does a 180 in this movie, playing the part of a street-wise, corrupt psycho cop. A must see for anyone who doesn't mind a few 4 letter words and a little bit of T&A. Definitely not for the kids
6305841861|5.0|Not a remake but a sequel, \\"Evil Dead 2\\" picks up Ash right where we left him: hit by the dark force of the woods at the break of dawn. Now he and a new group of victims (the owners of the house, no less) have to find a way to send the evil in the forest back where it came from. This second installment of the Evil Dead series is superior to the original in many ways, but it's also a very different kind of movie. It has less scares and more fun, and a sense of absurd that holds no punches. One thing is for sure: this special edition is top-quality stuff, and worthy of the two excellent editions they made for the original.<br />The video quality is superb, with a nice, solid image that maintains the colors very rich. Blacks are black, and all the different \\"blood\\" colors are saturated and with deep contrast. Also, unlike the first movie, this time \\"Evil Dead 2\\" comes both in widescreen and fullscreen format. The sound is also very good, specially the THX remastered soundtrack that, although it may be a little too \\"loud\\", still remains the best sound quality I've ever seen in an Evil Dead DVD. Sadly, no subtitles, but at least they didn't forget the close-captions for this edition.<br />The extras include bios and filmographies for Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, as well as the theatrical trailer, a preview for the \\"Evil Dead\\" Playstation game, still images and, best of all, a 30-documentary called \\"The Gore the Merrier\\", hosted by the special effects crew, who pretty much make fun of the whole making-of process while they proceed to point out mistakes seen during the movie.<br />I've saved the best for last. I'm talking about the EXCELLENT commentary track by Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Greg Nicotero. This has to be one of the most informative and entertaining commentaries I've ever heard in my life. Bruce Campbell had already done this solo with his commentary for the Special Edition of \\"Evil Dead\\", but this time, riding alongside Sam Raimi, he is even funnier. The both of them soon take over, though Nicotero obviously has the upper hand when it comes to the special effects. This commentary track alone is worth the price of the edition.<br />Personally, if you loved the first one, you can't go wrong with \\"Evil Dead 2\\". Fortunately, Anchor Bay has not tried to milk it for everything it's worth (see such case in \\"Army of Darkness\\"), so this edition should satisfy all deadite fans.both of them soon take over, though Nicotero obviously has the upper hand when it comes to the special effects.

B00005JKL8|4.0|Now,I'm not the type who likes Arnold blowing up entire countries or Rambo spraying a village with a minigun of unlimited ammo, but this was one of those types of movies, and, to my surprise, I liked it. Owen Wilson's performance was OK at best, but the action scences were INTENSE, and the plot twists kept me on the edge of my seat. While all that was great, the best part of the movie was by far it's audio side. The sound of explosions, jet engines, and bullets flying was amazing, and the music is more than just the standard heavy metal guitar solo: it actually has good music, music that I would want to listen to more than once. However, even though this was a great movie, it is a great movie ONCE. It's just one of those movies where it's the greatest thing in the world the first time, but makes you want to projectile vomit the second. But that's just my opinion. My advice is: go out and rent it first. If you think you might like to see it again, hey, go ahead.
0694013013|5.0|This is a beautiful book for teaching young children the names of body parts.  It is also a terrific animal actions book.  I love this book as a parent, and as a kindergarten teacher, I think it's great too!  My daughter enjoys acting out the story, and anticipates each turn of the page.  As it is a board book, it is suitable for the very young, who find it completely engaging.  A must have for a toddler's library!
B00005JK8K|4.0|Well, I must say that the action scenes in this movie were breathtaking, particularly the invasion scene and the radio takeover. However, Adam Beach, the actor who plays Ben Yahzee, is hot and cold throughout the movie. This was the role that Cage was born for, but he simply didn't fufill his potential in such a promising role. If not for that, I would have given it five stars. The story is great and brings to life the importance of the code that was never broken in the Pacific Theater.
B00005M91K|5.0|If God made a video diary, this would be it.
B00003CY5J|5.0|Now, Robert DeNiro has made a lot of great movies, nay, god-like movies. And while it may seem sacreligious, I believe that The Score ranks among the best of DeNiro. Norton is amazing, if slightly offensive playing a disabled janitor inside the museum that is the target of the heist. Great acting all around, and the computer geek scene is one of my favorite dark comedic scenes in a long time
6305907145|3.0|I am a huge Jane Austen fan, and have read all her books at least ten times. This must be clearly understood, or nothing useful can come from this review. (To paraphrase Dickens.)<br />Mansfield Park is probably the least well-loved of Austen's novels in general, and this is partly because the book is far more serious in tone than her other, more famous works (Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Northanger Abbey). The heroine, Fanny Price, rather than being healthy, hearty, lively and witty, is a bit weak and sickly of body, serious and studious of mind, and, frankly, a bit of a tedious old stick sometimes. Of all Austen's other characters, Fanny Price most closely resembles Mary Bennet from Pride & Prejudice, who was ridiculed even within her own family for being so serious, so studious, and so completely plain. <br />Fanny is not an easy character to identify with, or to love, particularly in this day and age of self-help books, support groups, and psychotherapy (all of which she would most likely be involved in were she alive today). She is highly judgmental (or so I found her), for she has extremely high standards of behaviour that her family are all too likely to fail to live up to, and in the novel she seems to serve primarily as a moral compass for the reader. She is also, however, timid to a fault. When she speaks her mind in public, which she is seldom able to do, given how she is treated by most of her family, she often speaks so gently that those who would most benefit from her message never even hear her words.<br />Given this, the task of bringing Fanny to life on film, would be a daunting one indeed. How to write a screenplay starring a completely un-heroic heroine? The obvious answer - perhaps the only answer - is to change the character of Fanny, and this is what the screenwriter did. In this film, Fanny is everything she is not in the book - funny, lively, healthy, firm, decisive, active, and a writer. (In the book, she is a reader.) Sheis engaging and easy to identify with. We cheer for her and want her to come out on top, as in the end she must.<br />The story of Mansfield Park so hinges on Fanny being exactly as Austen wrote her that, after seeing the trailer for the film, I watched the movie more from curiosity than interest. As a film, it is entertaining enough. The story is similar enough to Austen's to satisfy anyone with a taste for the period but no extensive knowledge of the novel, and the casting and acting is good, as I remember. As an adaptation of the work of one of the greatest authors in English literature, however, it falls far short of expectations raised by the excellent recent versions of several other Austen works, Pride and Prejudice (BBC 1995), Emma (also BBC), and Sense and Sensibility (with Emma Thompson). It is no more faithful an adaptation than the 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice (starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson), whose Lady Catherine disappointed me by being nice at the end. <br />The most jarring difference between the book and the movie, for me, was the reference to slaves providing the family's income. The eldest son's (Tom's) discovery and knowledge of exactly what has provided him with his comfortable life, is one of the movie's most dramatic, and certainly its most brutal, moments. In the book, Austen makes no reference whatsoever to what provides the family's income. She was, after all, a (mostly) gentle satirist about society and manners, and although she likely knew about slavery, there could be no need to mention it in her works of fiction. Indeed, in the book the prolonged absence of Sir Thomas Bertram (the story's other moral compass) seems engineered solely to allow his family to behave very badly indeed, and get themselves into such situations as could never have arisen had he been around, for life was very dull and predictable when he was around. There was no especial need for the destination to be Antigua; anywhere some weeks' distance away would have done just as well.<br />The injection of the modern sensibility of abhorrence of slavery seemed to me to be gratuitous, and an indication that, although he had a flair for the dramatic, the screenwriter had no particular understanding of or love for the original work, nor the patience to work through Austen's own plotline to the end. We did get there eventually, but I found this movie much less satisfying than the book.
B000065U1N|5.0|Definitely a great action movie, acurately re-creating the gritty, desert combat in the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia. Amazing sound: this movie is best seen with a huge woofer to capture all the amazing low frequency RPG explosions. Not only is the action amazing, but it is a sad, thought-provoking look at the horrors of war. Slightly gory, but not anywhere near a Private Ryan or a Windtalkers. My only gripe is a small one: there is an almost constant whine of sad African music playing in the background. But some people are into that stuff, and it is appropriate when depicting sorrow. In any case, this is a movie that any action lover or war buff SHOULD NOT MISS OUT ON. And if you like the movie, read the book, too.
B000002JSH|3.0|\\"Straight Shooter\\" is a rather ironic title because for Bad Company's second album, which came out in 1975 a year after their multi-platinum self-titled debut, because a lot of their material was written back in 1973 and obviously rejected for that first effort.  However, the two best songs were added by vocalist Paul Rodgers, \\"Shooting Star\\" and the Grammy-winning \\"Fell Like Makin' Love,\\" but those are counter-balanced by a couple of fillers from drummer Simon Kirke.  Rodgers wrote two solid songs but you can pick them both up on \\"10 from 6,\\" the Bad Company hits collection.  If they had taken those two songs and added them to \\"Run with the Pack,\\" then they would have had a second album almost as strong as their debut.  Unfortunately, that did not happen and while Bad Company brought back stripped down back to the basics rock 'n' roll, they literally had half of their greatest songs on their first album.
B00008DDRX|5.0|I have been waiting for this one on DVD. I have the VHS.<BR>I give this movie 5 stars because where else can you watch racing action like this between Porsche 917's and Ferrari 512's from  the 1970's.  As far as the plot and and who gets the girl, who cares? This is a racing classic for racing fans. Oh yeah, it stars Steve McQueen, another classic, not to mention  many other great race car drivers from that era that made this movie possible..
0316666343|3.0|I really really enjoyed this book, but was very unsatisfied with the ending.  Too many storylines are left unresolved.  Apart from the ending, it was a nice light read.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This film is very powerful. It is both oppressing and depressing. The soundtrack is very important in its dramatic element. I can safely say the soundtrack of this film carries the largest dramatic element I have ever heard a soundtrack carry. I'm pretty sure Mozart originally wrote lux Aterna, but Clint Mansell has done a superfluous job re-mixing it in so many ways for this film. This may be the most dramatic orchestrated piece of music I have ever heard used in film or television. Most recently Howard Shore used it in a preview trailer for Lord of the Rings Two Towers. I literally had goose bumps. This film is of the most powerful films I own. I give it five stars and hope you will take the time to see it.
0385335482|4.0|This is such a fun read.  I couldn't put it down.  The main character is clever and thinks a lot like I do!  I would recommmend this book to all girls out there who have that slight passion to spend a little money!
0790729652|5.0|Surely you know who Batman is. Then you know he is the second most recognized American hero next to Superman. Batman was the next big success in DC's comic to film genre. Marvel is only now beginning to realize the potential in the mainstream comic to film genre. There are a lot of films around that originate in comics that no one knows about (e.g. From Hell). Spiderman was a great film for 2002, Daredevil is expected to do well, and Hellboy is in the making. If you liked or look forward to any of these, then you must own Batman. If you have not seen it, come out from hiding. Acknowledge that geniuses have made an incredible machine that allows people to views great stories on a screen. And then find a means to experiencing this film. Five out of five stars.
0345440900|4.0|I got this book when my son was 7 months old.  I was looking for practical advice/solutions for getting my son to sleep without nursing, rocking, bouncing, etc.  The book's suggestions of creating and following a set daily routine (a much better word than schedule) really sunk in and helped me get my son on a better nap and sleep schedule.  Hogg's simple instructions and easy-to- remember advice was just what I was looking for.  I wish I had read this book while I was pregnant and could have utilized its suggestions from Day 1.
B00005JKCH|5.0|It is about time Marvel stepped up to the plate with a big time superhero film. DC had Superman and Batman with tons of success and sequels. This millenium belongs to Marvel. Spiderman came out. Daredevil will come out next month. The Hulk arrives in June. I was also eager to hear rumors about another great comic character, Hellboy. A Hellboy film is in the making. Anyway, back to the task at hand, this movie was outstanding. I bet I saw this film +5 times while it was in theaters. When I first heard Toby Maguire was going to be Spiderman I admit I had my doubts. I did not take into consideration that Toby Maguire had to be Peter Parker as well as Spiderman. Toby was great for the role of Peter Parker, thus making him better for Spiderman. Everyone enjoys watching an average Joe acomplish greatness. His urge to triumph over the school bully, his desire for the girl he loves, these are elements important to every coming-of-age hero storyline. Taking someone in a low place and raising them above everyone's expectations. These are components in making a great hero movie. Spiderman includes them all. This movie is definitely of the best of 2002 and a great DVD to purchase. It has loads of supplemental material. The extras are actually entertaining also, which isn't as common as it should be in DVD extras. This is a movie to watch again and again. Everyone should own it. I give it five our of five stars.
0385486804|4.0|This is the second book I've read by John Krakauer, the first being Into Thin Air.  Although both books were well written, the first one was much better.<br />This is a story about Chris McCandless who, in 1992, hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the bush, never to come out alive.  The book is brief but tells about Chris' life after he graduated from highschool, the odd jobs he took, the lone travels he made and the so called relationship he had with his parents.<br />This is a great book and if you like John Krakauer, you'll like this one too.

0440234743|4.0|This is a great example of the golddinggers in today's society, while weaving in a storyline of mystery and lies. This is a great book but it's ending is a little uneventfull. But overall a great book.
0790730960|5.0|This is a great sequel to a great movie. Batman is a must-watch must-own DVD. The sequel is the exact same with one exception; If you do not already own Batman, it is a higher priority. These are the best of the Batman film series. I own them both, and have decided to let the others stay on the shelves at my local video store. If you are a big Batman fan, buy them all. If you are only a moderate fan, buy Batman and Batman Returns. Either way, you must own this movie. So go ahead and stick it into your shopping cart now, after all Amazon.com has the lowest prices on the net and you will have to buy it sooner or later. <BR>5 out of 5 stars. <BR>Put it in your cart.
0312305060|5.0|Reading this book again after over three years, I am still astonished at its beauty, grace, and scope. Blending the stories of a day in each of the lives of three women, &quot;The Hours&quot; evokes how intertwined human lives are and how much impact each moment can have. The novel opens with Virginia Woolf's suicide in 1941, but then backtracks to the day she begins writing &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;, which is the first of her great works. Another story is post-World War II where a woman is reading &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; and is discovering her crisp life to be utterly constricting. The third story is a modern retelling of &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;. By contrasting the deaths in the story with the minutiae of daily existence, Cunningham inspires the reader with the often-overlooked beauty that surrounds us. One cannot help but fall in love, as Cunningham has, with Virginia Woolf and her brilliant mind.
0887307280|4.0|Gerber's book is a very easy read, and should stimulate your thought processes even if you disagree with some of his advice.  His major thesis is that many small businesses fail because they are started by technicians who are not prepared to handle the managerial and entrepreneurial tasks that go with running a business.<br />His minor thesis (which he spends far more time on) is that a small business should be run as if the intent were to franchise it.  As a consequence, the owner should devise systems to insure consistentcy in execution of every aspect of the business.  As part of this, Gerber advises envisioning the business at the point of maturity, determining what the systems and personnel roles will need to be at that point, and starting from day one acting as if you were at that point of maturity (this might mean that you have one person filling eight roles).<br />Having witnessed a number of small business failures, and having participated in one, I find myself in agreement with all of his major points, but not necessarily in the execution of them (which, as an aside, he should have developed more thoroughly).  With my next entrepreneurial adventure, I will definitely be following his advice regarding systems and organisation.
B000002B7Y|5.0|No Rest for the Wicked is one of Ozzy's best releases. As with Blizzard and Diary, there are very few weak tracks. Zakk Wylde is a good addition on guitar. While no Rhoades, he has his own style. Randy Castillo is solid on drums. Ozzy is an under-rated vocalist. Critics complain that his voice is thin and weak, but metal isn't about singing pretty. Charisma can get you a long way. Ozzy's voice is distinct. Miracle Man is a rip on an evanglest preacher who would regularly condemn ozzy. Another song is about the Manson murders, Bloodbath in Paradise. No Ozzy fan should be without No Rest for the Wicked.
B00005AQE8|5.0|2pac was always a prolific writer, a miracle musician, and an amazing entertainer. Now, 2pac showcases his talent in the classic album All Eyez On Me. All Eyez On Me is 2pac unleashed after an 11 month stay in Prison. This is a relentless Pac. On the track Only God Can Judge Me, 2pac sends out a message to the world that judged him. On California Love, 2pac lets loose and enjoys living and being outta jail, along side Dr. Dre and one of the most memorable hooks to ever hit rap. Shorty Wanna Be A Thug is a story of every young child that ever looked up to the lifestyle of gangsta rap, basically predicting what most feared would happen. Heaven Ain't Hard to Find is a song trying to persuade a woman to let Pac Make love to. Picture me Rollin is a track for all the gangstas and thugs, saying it how it is, and avoiding police, as he has done most of his life. The unknown hit of Rather Be Ya N.I.G.G.A. is a steller moment of the record. Over all, this album is one of Pac's best with too many hits to count, but it is a knockout.
B000060P79|4.0|yea, i have to admit that simple plan is hardly original. but a good argument for that is.. who really is anymore. they write their own music, play their own music.. so they are half original.

630463949X|4.0|My comments:<br />Excellent video production, great 5.1 Digital mix. It's a live concert filmed in Burbank California in 1997. I've only ever watched movies on my finally completed system so this<BR>was a good audio test. I wasn't sure what I'd think of AC-3/5.1 for music, but they did a good job. Very dynamic. I never tried the Standard Dolby Surround on Side2 of the double sided DVD. Why bother when you have 5.1!<br />You may have seen this on PBS. I saw a bit of it on there but<BR>they made it impossible to watch by cutting in about 3 times<BR>per song.<br />My only complaint is that there is no 16:9 or therabouts aspect ratio to fit my Hitachi 43FDX20B. I watched it in 4:3 Edge Expanded mode and Zoom-1 (on the TV not the DVD player). Both were easily adequate and the TV Menus were still readable.<br />Highly Recommended.<br />R.Bond<BR>1/30/2003
B000002VFW|5.0|I have listened to and own many of the Lisa Stansfield's other cd's, but \\"Affection\\" is my absolute all-time favorite of hers! I am still, to this day, blown away by Lisa's vocal skills. She is one of the best singers out there. It's a shame that she hasn't released any new material here in the states in a while, but \\"Affection\\" fills the void.<br />Of course, my favorite song is \\"All Around the World.\\" I don't care how old the song it, it's still a great song! All of the songs on the cd, for that matter, are great! There's not one bad thing I can say about the cd.<br />Anyone who listens to this cd will not be disappointed. This is definitely a cd to own!!!!!
B000002HRE|5.0|What's wrong with Metallica.  I'll tell you; nothing at all.  They haven't \\"sold out\\" in the least.  I can safely say this is some of their best material.  Jason Newsted is a more than adequate replacement for the late Burton.  It's production quality is leaps better than that of their older albums.  This album is said to be primarily composed of songs and ideas that didn't make the cut for Load.  I would have been disappointed not to have heard this material.  'Unforgiven II' is better than the original.  'Devil's Dance' is original and interesting for newbies and Metallica veterans alike.  Hetfield's vocals on this album are superb, an undisputed upward trend from the first album to the most current.  Kirk is still awesome in ways that we haven't heard on their other albums; he substitutes speed with uniqueness and innovation.  He lends his talent to the album that wouldn't be possible without him.  Lars is still kickin' it with the double kick set he uses in the other albums.  He drums a bit more conservatively, but is as the case with kirk, is taking one for the team.  The Jem on this album and in my book of Metallica songs gets one of the top 3 spots is 'Where the Wild Things Are'.  I haven't heard anything that comes close to it.  For this song alone buy the album.  The band has matured and it shows.  Gone are the days of speed metal and killer chops and licks you you couldn't play at home if you wanted to; the new metallica produces songs that sound more like music than a 10 minute, impress-your-music-teacher tune.  I am by no meens knocking the older albums that are amazing in their own right, but comparing pre and post black album metallica is like apples and oranges; both are excellent but not in the same category.  And all those that do knock the new metallica are living in the past.  Come on boys, you didn't think they were gonna play like teenagers forever, honestly, did ya?

B00000DCHI|4.0|OK, for the good news.  If you are at least 25 years old, you will recognize most of these songs, and will actually sing along.  With well known songs such as &quot;Piano Man&quot;, &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot;, Moving' Out&quot;, &quot;My Life&quot;, &quot;She's Got A Way&quot;, and &quot;Uptown Girl&quot;, and relative unknowns such as &quot;Goodnight Saigon&quot; (which moves me to tears!) and &quot;Scenes From An Italian Restaurant&quot;, this collection is a good addition for a Billy Joel fan, for some of his albums are a bit uneven.<br />Now for the bad news: &quot;Honesty&quot;, from the &quot;52nd Street&quot; release, is strangely absent.  It could have been placed there as opposed to &quot;The Stranger&quot;.  However, in spite of this, it is still a good collection.
