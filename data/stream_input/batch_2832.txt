B009EEFTMC|5.0|It forces me to pay attention to details, yet I find it relaxing and satisfying as a pre sleep activity.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|haven't used it that much will tell you later now hopefully it will be great like all the amazon stuff I have ordered
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|To quote Luigi Novi's '*' review,<br /><br />  \\"As it turns out, the film's entire content, much as I inferred from the trailers, can be boiled down to five words:<br />  'Giant Robots Versus Giant Monsters.'<br />  That's it.\\"<br /><br />Perfect.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great Movies and Great Boxed Set. Was very happy to get this set at such a reasonable price when I purchased it.
B00AAI7B7W|4.0|I have seen this movie at least 10 times, and still find it worth watching again. The video quality was great. No interruptions.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game most definitely.<br />I like the rooms and the power ups,only wish the game didn't go so fast at the end of a round.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|To anyone who watches shows on USA, this is a must watch!!!<br />The writing and acting is so intense sometimes and I love all the characters in it or at least can relate to them<br />Havent seen season 3 yet but hoping its just as good as two!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I am a Neil Gaiman fan, through and through, but this may be my new favorite book from him. The way he mixed reality and magic is seamless and entirely believable. Though the book is short, it does not feel like anything is missing from the narrator's journey. I very nearly started over the moment that I finished reading. I highly recommend this book to fantasy and sci-fi lovers.
B000UJCALI|5.0|I'm opening myself up for debate on this one, but I can't get enough of this movie. I've seen it close to 30 times and I still find myself asking questions about what it could all possibly mean, and that is the way Kubrick intended it to be. As far as the DVD itself and ordering, I have no complaints and everything come in as advertised.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I haven't been this emotionally involved in a story for years; I have not been as impressed with the intricacies of detail, of character depth, of mystery novel possibly ever. It is alarmingly, glaringly real...which is awesome and scary all in one; a blinding annoying light shoved in your face, illuminating the darkest corners of the human psyche. And the language made me feel like I was being told the best bar story ever. It's a real mind freak...you're gonna love it!!!
B00447L4JG|5.0|I can't get enough of this classic movie. Everything came in as advertised and have enjoyed it since. The price was also really good too. Highly recommend!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|perfect for toddlers and young kids has a lot of fun games. highly worth it. there are a few times my toddler asked for help but for the most part was able to play on his own.

1463514581|5.0|My very first book fromDenise Grover Swank, and I've been hooked every since! Rose is a character you can't help but love and feel for. Perhaps even relate to some of her life. This is the beginning of a fabulous series! Don't miss out on Rose and her misadventures. She keeps you and everyone in town on their toes and gives the ol ladies something to talk about

B0027MJU00|5.0|This book was as thrilling as Gone Girl. I hope to read more of her books. Excellent writer! Fast read!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I've quickly read all the books in the series and have very much enjoyed them. I hope to read more books in the future, if the author writes more.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This was a very entertaining novel.  I read in all in one setting.  This is a fantasy that holds your interest.  Stephen King fans should enjoy this book.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This was such a great book to read. I haven't yet read anything quite like it. It was  heart wrenching and beautifully written.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was intricate, interesting, addictive, and do-able.  Loved it!<br />I am looking forward to the next room. Please make it fast.
006178480X|4.0|I still believe its a great read.  I was hesitant when I read the blurb on this book before it came out.  I had heard a few things about this being a \\"sci-fi\\" book, but I can honestly say that I would not categorize this book in that genre.  If you are a fan of history and theoretical physics this book is for you.  Rollins covers 3 historical figures not often mentioned in \\"historical fiction\\" and blends them wonderfully.  The scientific element of the story is real enough to keep you interested without being an advanced physics textbook.<br />I was not thrilled with \\"tails\\" by any means.  I completely understand what the author was doing with this section of the book and I can respect it and enjoy it in retrospect if the characters mentioned in \\"tails\\" stay there.  If they reoccur, it will seem like a major cop out.  At least in my opinion.<br />I did not enjoy Duncan and am unsure as to why I did not enjoy him.  I was much more open to Tucker Wayne, although the parts of \\"Blood Line\\" written from the point of view of his partner caused me to change from reading intently to skimming as quickly as possible.  I hope to see more from Monk and Kowalski in the future as well.<br />I am very curious as to why the Guild was not mentioned in this installment.  I hope to see them return in some fashion during the next book in the series.  It may just be me, but I do not feel that Sigmas business with them is completely wrapped up.<br />If you are a James Rollins fan, this book will not disappoint.  I am very happy with the 9th book of the series and am eagerly looking forward to the next.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this application. Didn't know there was such an application out there. But after study, this was the best for the price. Simple to use.
0375869026|5.0|We will be using this book with our middle school students as we all explore empathy and understand each characters reality from their perspective.
0062073931|4.0|Evil Under the Sun was written and published in the dark days of 1941, when Britain stood alone against the Axis powers (or did until Hitler got the bright idea to invade Russia that June). The book makes no allusion to the war, no doubt by design as the last thing Britons wanted from their escapist reading was a reminder that there was a war on.<br /><br />Instead, we get a highly engaging murder mystery with a set of colorful characters, an interesting setting (a resort hotel located on a promontory that is cut off from the mainland at high tide) and a fully engaged Hercule Poirot, who just happens to be vacationing there. Unlike in her most recent previous Poirot books (Hercule Poirot's Christmas, Sad Cypress, The Patriotic Murders), author Agatha Christie makes her detective a main character right off the bat in this one instead of bringing him in after the murder had been committed.<br /><br />There is much less time spent at the start filling in the back stories of the supporting characters than in the previous books and no real romantic subplot. What is familiar is the idea of having sympathetic characters as suspects and an unsympathetic character as the murder victim. Christie had played with this dynamic in Appointment With Death and Death on the Nile several years earlier.<br /><br />It is quite effective here as we feel our emotions put through the ringer as clues emerge and red herrings are introduced. You find yourself constantly thinking, \\"Oh no, I hope it isn't him/her who did it!\\" The resolution is rather convoluted and a bit \\"unfair\\" in that it introduces new evidence to support the conclusion. Still, there is a very active Poirot and that is always supremely entertaining.
B008QTVNUI|2.0|BORING, overrated,For simple minds tat have nothing to do.Mindless entertainment.<br />Lot of it filmed in Charlotte and that is no big deal

B0099Y2MYK|1.0|Downton Abbey was some of the best t.v. ever!<br /><br />Seasons 1 & 2 took me on this emotionally driven ride that seemed never to end....but it had...<br /><br />....l knew it when season 3 began, l was right there, every Sunday, watching....<br /><br /> ....what happened to the unanswered questions and heated loose ends from season 2?<br />...they were gone...<br /><br />...the jealousy, bitterness and arrogance that added so much to the core of the show went missing too, just when it was needed the most...<br /><br />...dishevelment, chaos, and heated fun would have been a welcome diversion from the foretold character write offs we knew were coming...<br /><br />...cliffhangers and \\"will they or won't they\\" soap antics are a real discredit to a show of this caliber!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|i feel it is more challenging than other matching games.  i also like purchasing and decorating my tanks.  my grandson also has his own tanks
B00280LYIM|5.0|I can't wait to read the next one! I read it in 3 hours! I recommend this book to anyone. (I would read them I order :)
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|got bored with it.  just like so many other matching games so i chose to remove this one and keep others
0440242401|3.0|originally posted here: [...]<br /><br />The Commencement: I bought this book because I love Sophie Kinsella's Confessions of a Shopaholic and I've Got Your Number so I had high hopes for this book. I bought this book the day of my break up so I had high hopes for it to cheer me up and make me feel light and fluffy like Kinsella's other books.<br /><br />The Cover: The covers for Sophie Kinsella's books are really plain and simple. They fit well in the adult or romance genres that don't need to be all flashy. They can be pretty, but not stunning.<br /><br />The Composition: This book was not what I expected it to be. It started out really great. I enjoyed it a lot, but it started spiraling down somewhere along the pages. It got too frustrating for me. And I did not like the ending that much. It can be considered a happy ending, but it makes no sense to me how they arrived there. It's like \\"Sorry. This isn't working out. BAM! Happily ever after~\\" Despite that, I still enjoyed parts of the book. Sophie Kinsella's humor always shines through. A lot of the chapters were entertaining enough to pull you to the next one.<br /><br />The Characters:<br /><br />Lexi Smart had retrograde amnesia, and she wakes up losing 3 years of her life. But she has changed so much since then so she had a lot to deal with. She kept on insisting that her life was not her own because she couldn't recognize it. I guess I understand that, but it can be so frustrating sometimes. Maybe I would be frustrated too if I ever ended up in her situation. But she can be so blind about her own situation. She doesn't see what's right in front of her eyes.<br /><br />So here we have a love triangle - two guys, one girl. Eric, Lexi's husband, was one crazy guy. He is obsessed with cleanliness and his work, and barely cares for anything else. he just kept on ignoring Lexi. I do not understand how Lexi was able to stay with him for 2 years. Jon, the architect, was really mysterious and a little too forceful. He kept on forcing Lexi to remember their relationship. He was really nice and sweet too though, but I didn't really form any attachment with him.<br /><br />Her family was not the best support system. Lexi's mum was a crazy character. (I cannot remember her name. Sorry!) She only cared about her dogs and she hid so much from her daughter. She got too stuck in the past and she wasn't even the one with amnesia. Mum's should not simply give up when they have children to take care of. Amy, Lexi's sister, was a horrible kid. She took advantage of her amnesiac sister and she kept on swindling people. Her old friends and coworkers were quite mean to her too, but I guess we cannot really blame them that much.<br /><br />The Couple: Erm. I'm not too fond of the romance in this book. While Jon can be alluring at times, I just don't get him. I also don't get how things worked out for them in the end. How did that happen?! Is it really that easy to fall for someone you can't remember?<br /><br />The Charm: You can never go wrong with Kinsella's humor. I can always count on her to make me laugh. The part I really liked about this book though is the fact that it made me reflect on how we all change throughout the years. Sometimes we can't believe that our pasts were the people we used to be. Sometimes we change for the worst and sometimes for the better. That's life.<br /><br />I also wonder if it's better to only part of your memory or all of it. Lexi kept on struggling because she had this idea of herself and she has changed so much since. Would it have been less frustrating if she knew nothing about herself at all?<br /><br />The Conclusion: As much as I love Sophie Kinsella, this book didn't work as well as I would have wanted. We can still find her humor and wonderful writing, but there are some things that are left to be undesired. Overall, it was still a good book. It just wasn't for me. I do not want to remember Remember Me?e kept on forcing Lexi to remember their relationship. He was really nice and sweet too though, but I didn't really form any attachment with him.<br /><br />Her family was not the best support system. Lexi's mum was a crazy character.

B009HUB40Y|3.0|i removed from my phone, too much like other games i have and i dont have time for them all
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|I love it! It was a great movie that does justice to the G.I.JOEs and brings the new look to original.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved the historical content of the story line. It was very well done. I highly recommend this book to all.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|By far, this is my favorite book of all the Psy-Changling stories. What happened and what happens to two of the most powerful Psy ever? The dark danger of Kaleb Krychek (who will always look like Nicholas Lea is my mind, for obvious reasoning) coupled with the innate goodness of the Psy Sahara Kyriakus is even more compelling due to their unprecedented Psy abilities.<br /><br />I could not put this book down. It deserves to be read in one sitting if possible. The story is at times a freight train that leaves the reader breathless, while also revealing aspects of many characters throughout that will leave you wanting more.<br /><br />This story is not without pain or tragedy. It is a beginning of a new Psy (and hopefully more stories!) and the end of stories that have been building through the series. I do not want to give away any spoilers as this is a book to be savored. Read it, and be prepared to want more.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Enjoyable. Reading. Don't have to think. Just enjoy!  Always enjoy Nicholas sparks. Good read for beach or rainy day. Would recommend it highly.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I bought this book some time ago for my Kindle, and forgot about it. I love both Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, and could not imagine how their talents could work together to produce a decent read.  But wow!  I loved this book!<br /><br />Armageddon is coming. Good versus evil. The end of the world as we know it.<br /><br />Events are overseen by the Demon Crowley and the Angel Aziraphale, who've been at, well odds at each other, in this game for longer than they care to admit. While each represents one side, they've come to understand over the years that there is a spark of goodness in the worst of man and a spark of bad in the best. And face it, they really like the Human world and don't want to see the end or participate in the coming downfall.<br /><br />This book is funny. Really fun!  No spoilers, just a hint to get your attention.<br /><br />The Four Horsemen. And the OTHER Four Horsemen.<br />The birth of the Anti-Christ, who by the way, is missing when the coming events need him the most. Even the best laid plans....<br />Agnes Nutter, Witch. The book of prophecies she wrote that has gone missing.<br /><br />Take Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; throw in C.S. Lewis' The Screwtape Letters; and you have this book. Pointed, irreverent, hysterically funny. The more religious knowledge you have the better the book will be, as it is chock-full of insider jokes.<br /><br />Read this one. Don't wait. I think I need to go read it again!
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Monkey Boxing is great because it is a button-mashing action game that lets you beat monkeys, level up with a training section, and customize a character with unlockable content from achievements. You have 50 matches to do, but you can continue to fight afterwards to gain achievements. The way they made it was amazing and how I feel every game should be made. It has a campaign mode so you can keep getting points and level up...without in-game purchasing that tells you how long you have to play before you have to pay up.<br /><br />The monkeys you fight have different fighting styles measured by endurance, strength, and speed. I like this, but if you just mash the buttons as fast as you can, you can beat them easily. The monkeys, of course, get harder to fight but this gives you an advantage against the AI. Maybe add multiplayer mode? The monkeys have funny looks or names and a challenge monkey to face at varying time intervals. Leveling up to face the challenge monkey seems nice to give the game more purpose.<br /><br />Other aspects that have nice features are the character customization and the training section. Customize the monkey with clothes and styles of glasses and more. You unlock most things by beating monkeys and unlocking achievements. You can train to really up your game speed, strength, and endurance. Training is good for beating those challenge monkeys. The only part that is bad is the repetitiveness.<br /><br />This has basic things you want in a mobile game. The fact that it is monkeys boxing just makes it that much better. I think it would be fun for a while and has funny parts, including the names of monkeys. I would not have purchased this for $3 though, maybe $0.99. While I am not going bananas for this, I like the way it is put together.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The book makes you look a life differently. It is great teacher. Read it many times and it provides different meaning every time I read it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so great. Im like addicted to this game and its really brain twister and a fun game to play when you have nothing to do
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I love this trilogy!! I know it is similar to hunger games but it's a totally different book and a very good read!! I can't wait for the third!!! I definitely recommend reading this series!!
B0026P3G12|4.0|I felt the quality of the CD didn't do her voice justice. The You Tube sound was better. Still enjoy it though - just hope subsequent CD's will be better.
B00C8USQEM|4.0|Please be aware, the seller often sends the UK version of the disks, so make sure you have a region free player (PS3 is often region free) as most of the disks will not play on a US/Canada region Blu-ray player.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Being a fan of the TV show I thought it would be fun to read the book he allegedly is researching on the show. It was well done and followed the show's description of his writings. It is listed as authored by &#34;Richard Castle&#34; -- a fictional character -- so have no idea who actually did the writing. (A team of ABC writers?)
B009POCG0Y|1.0|the story started out promising, especially with Mc C as the actor in the title role BUT as it progressed and especially the ending and I REPEAT especially the ending, everything went to hades in a handbasket. I am a Senior Citizen but not a prude.... just about everything about it was disgusting and though highly touted from another review, someplace, I think Mc C must have been desperate for an acting role and a job.  He should have been ashamed of himself for this one.
B005UKK4Y2|3.0|This was a little more stupid than I was anticipating. Maybe I'm just too old at 33! My husband was a bit disappointed too.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is so much fun it s addicting.  Looks easy and it is till you get to the last matches  and I love to challenge myself. I play this myself and keep trying to get faster and faster.  Love it.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|this is the second book of Kate Morton's that I have read and i enjoyed it as much as the first.  Her books are great to curl up with!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I want to compare this to Girl with the Dragon Tattoo so I will even though there are many differences in the stories.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I read Defending Jacob for a book club.  After our discussion and hearing other people's take on the story, I wondered if I didn't need to read it again.  Whole new points of view.
B00BB8OHMW|5.0|This was a very emotional movie for me.I've never read Shakespeare because I couldn't understand it, but this movie made his work come alive. I think they really choose the actors well also.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|This game has hard levels to make after you have used all of your &#34;free&#34; power-ups.  But the power-ups are fun to make work.
B008Y6YCB0|2.0|Not too much of an original story line. I like the time period setting and actors but, the story line messed up the whole context of the whole picture for me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Absolutely one of my favorite apps! I love all the great ideas, you can find just about anything. Perfect way to kill time :)
B00821OX98|5.0|I had a slow weekend so I thought I would check out the series.  I was hooked right away and finished off the season1.  I do like scifi though so it works for me
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Fast paced, heart wrenching, and amazing. Everything anyone could want in a book is right here! Best book ever! Thanks
B0086900TI|1.0|Do the filmmakers think this has any resemblance to kids or teachers in public schools ? It doesn't.<br />This is pure overly sentimantal pap. As if public schools are just filled with sad, desperate, abused kids.... none of them are well adjusted.. every one a mess.<br />This film is a boogie insult to working class people. What's the point ? For some out of touch film school grad to showcase both his \\"art\\" and \\"social consciense\\" in one film ??<br />I really wish I hadn't bothered with this.
B004XIQIPQ|3.0|I was a big fan of Humbug although critics did not think much of this album.  I<br />expected a little more but not totally disapointed.  Album has a good flow but<br />nothing to rave about.  Looking forward to new CD this fall.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Folks, it's a $99 DAC/Amp combo!  Lets not get overly critical of this device, it works fantastic with my Sennheiser HD 598s, Shure SE425-V's.  My ear/head phones are thoroughly pushed and the sound is expansive.  I own the Schiit Magni / Modi (amp / DAC respectively) combo and can notice only minor fine details in the sound difference between the E17 and the Schiit Magni/Modi.  This E17 is great for the budget conscious or for the on-the-go music listener who is a discerning listener.  This device is slightly smaller than an iPhone so is is EXTREMELY portable and isn't that why you looking into this device anyway?  Take the plunge, I did and I have no regrets!  Check out head-fi.org to read more detailed reviews for those of you who are true audiophiles out there!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I got this on a whim when it was released for the reasons many have stated, like low price and streaming capabilities. Sadly I had to wait almost a month for it to arrive. One has to wonder why big companies come out with something that is supposed to be revolutionary and then don't build inventory before the initial release.<br /><br />Anyway. I got it and plugged it into my fairly new LG 55 inch TV only to find that I need to use the power adapter, apparently my 2 year old $2000 TV doesn't have the powered HDMI ports. Oh well no big deal, once I plugged in the power cord to the device and mains it was recognized and I set my TV to that input. It instructs you to log in on your computer or device to set everything up. That is when I found out that my main desktop computer that I use 99% of the time at home will not work with this device because I connect to my home network with a network cable instead of Wifi. I do have Wifi but mainly use it for my smartphone, tablet the occasional times I use my laptop at home. So I powered up the laptop only to realize I don't have Chrome installed as I use Firefox. Downloaded Chrome and waited for my slow laptop to do all of the Windows updates as I hadn't switched it on in awhile. Finally logged into the Chromecast setup site using the Chrome browser only to find that Windows Vista is not a supported OS! This kind of sucks!<br /><br />So I power up my Asus Transformer tablet and go to the Google storefront and download the Android App. Finally I open the app and do the setup and log into the Chromecast device on my TV. Wow, I am finally connected after just 45 minutes :(<br /><br />So, I try to figure out what I can do. Maybe I will listen to some music from my collection. I open Google Play and try to play some albums only to find it the device does not stream music from my tablet but only from the few things I have in the cloud.<br /><br />I had hoped that this device would me to stream from my main computer to the TV, looks like it will not do that.<br /><br />Next I opened my YouTube app on the tablet and was able to stream some videos from their to the TV. Not bad if the YouTube video you want to watch is of a high enough quality to look good on a 55 inch TV screen but if not it will look rather blurry.<br /><br />I don't have a Neflix account and  my TV already has streaming capabilities for that and VUDU built in.<br /><br />I can see some uses for this device but I am really glad I did not shell out any more then I did.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW 9/21/2013<br /><br />Well to my surprise Amazon sent me the Neflix free 3 month offer so I did get something not expected. I ended up moving it to one of the HDMI ports on my new Onkyo stereo system and that seems better than when it was just in the TV input. Now I can easily listen to music I have since added to my Cloud space. I think this would be a plus if I travel.<br /><br />In reassessing my initial review I have raised my rating to 4 stars.like it will not do that.<br /><br />Next I opened my YouTube app on the tablet and was able to stream some videos from their to the TV. Not bad if the YouTube video you want to watch is of a high enough quality to look good on a 55 inch TV screen but if not it will look rather blurry.<br /><br />I don't have a Neflix account and  my TV already has streaming capabilities for that and VUDU built in.<br /><br />I can see some uses for this device but I am really glad I did not shell out any more then I did.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW 9/21/2013<br /><br />Well to my surprise Amazon sent me the Neflix free 3 month offer so I did get something not expected. I ended up moving it to one of the HDMI ports on my new Onkyo stereo system and that seems better than when it was just in the TV input. Now I can easily listen to music I have since added to my Cloud space. I think this would be a plus if I travel.<br /><br />In reassessing my initial review I have raised my rating to 4 stars.
B000W4RFHK|5.0|This book is a must read for any Kerouac fan or anyone who wants to read true American classics. The imagery of the San Francisco bay area is very realistic.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|I had to return it to the seller and purchase another copy since only the bonus disk loads. The movie itself is great!
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I have been completely wrapped up in this album for a couple of weeks now.  Absolutely LOVE many of the songs on it.  Toward the middle of the album it slows down a bit for me, but they finish it off with flare!  I have their previous album &#34;Black Parade&#34; and really enjoy it, but I like this album even more.
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|Not a bad story, a little long and slow at times. Ending was average at best. If you don't come across anything else it's worth a watch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Honestly, I think IT IS AWESOME! I mean, to the El Macho Layer to all the minion costumes. And it's all free! It's a great deal and you have to buy this app.
B005544V6A|5.0|I saw this with no idea what this show was about (I'm not so familiar with the wording). I thought the dialogue is amazing and the character development was really sharp.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This is a great game. I would gladly pay money for this but glad I got it as a faotd. No iap easy play to hard play so even when you get stuck it's fun. Love this game.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|You never know what to expect next!<br />Edge of your seat, fun and loved all the characters. Well written script.
059306495X|3.0|Given the reviews I thought this would be something special, like the 'the girl with the tattoo' trilogy or a new Hennig Mankell.  It isn't, the characters are formulaic, the disillusined CIA operative, the tough but good hearted cop, you can see Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman playing these two roles.  The writing is very over described and at times plodding, the author seems to assume his audience has a mental age of about 15. I wish I could cut and paste to show how bad this can be at times. The baddie is again straight out of central casting, the traumatized son of a 'good' man who turns to terrorism and is fiendishly clever ( he's a doctor no less) it's all very Hollywood and very cliched.  What is good is the depth of research and some of the action sequences, the author has done his homework, but really it isn't anything new and it's very slanted towards America and it's view of the war on terror.  Not for the discerning reader.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Excellent protector but could have a better indentation for the screen support feature.  I read at night in bed and it sometimes slips out of the niche.
B000W4HIX6|5.0|This is one movie that will blow the hell out of your from your seat. As in 1988, not much movie offer so much action and fire power.<br />Even with a running time of more than two hours, the pace is fast and with a good story line. It is one of the show from Hollywood that generates a number of copycats like. Bruce Wills was made for this movie which runs for another four Die Hards outing.<br />The latest was the worst of the lot even with great action. It lacks the storyline to hold the interest. The second installment &#34;Die Harder&#34; and the fourth &#34;Die Hard or Live Free&#34; is the best next to the first.
B0024Y9EYS|2.0|The characters seemed to be unable to use some common things that would have made their lives easier, such as ski-masks and body armor.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I almost gave this app 5 stars, but it doesn't allow a password unless you upgrade to the premium version.  Password protection for an app like this is a necessity even in the free version.  Other than that, it is a great app!
B004VYYA2K|5.0|This Barbie Zipbin is the best for quick clean up or house of play.  It is very easy for my daughter (5) to open and close herself and so she can play with it and then zip it up and clean up.  It is very nice looking and blends in well with the Barbie dollhouse.  Would recommend and the price is very reasonable.
068484267X|5.0|Even the author wonders how he survived such poverty in Ireland.  It was an eye opener.  Reading the book made me more thankful for everything I have in my life.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|It's fun although a bit repetitive.  I think the items in the game cost entirely to much as it takes forever as it is just to save up enough to move to the next shark.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|I enjoy films that explore the mysteries of death.  This story tells of 3 different people who are touched by death in some way:  a French woman who had a near-death experience; an American man who is a medium and receives information from the other side when he touches someone; and an English boy who looses his twin brother.  All three stories overlap in the end.  Matt Damon was excellent as usual.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game! The only problem with it is that I waste too much time on it! I hate having to stop before I run out of moves!
1451626096|2.0|What a disappointment!  I have all the books in this series, and like/love them all... until this one.  omg!  Elizabeth, the white princess, whines and complains about everything!  If ever anyone played the victim, it is the white princess.  I've read other books about her, and even though she didn't get everything in life that she wanted, she never came across as such a negative person.  This story is a mix of fact and fiction, since not everything is known from that time.  Elizabeth carries on and on about the death of her (assumed) uncle & lover King Richard III for most of the book.  She is betrothed to the new King Henry VII, then says he raped her ( &#60;- fiction) when she knows it's her duty to provide him with children.  Her sister would've loved to be in her place and be queen, but since Elizabeth is the oldest, she decides SHE will marry Henry VII.  So why complain about it?  This book doesn't live up to the others in the group.  I'm hoping the author's next book is about a different time period.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It took a while to figure some of these out! I needed help with a couple of the rooms. I am ready to have more levels added!!
B00DH1G7DS|2.0|I went to use the Sudoku game, yesterday, it required me to log-in to Amazon before it would start. Just saying', is this absolutely necessary? The app crashes about every fouth usage and wipes the notes field. Sometimes, when I've returned to the app after completing a game the timer has continued to run.
B00493E1GI|5.0|This is a must see. You will laugh and cry and it will make you think. Watch it. Don't let people tell you it is about a selfish women, rather it is about a smart woman looking for happiness rather than settling, which many people tend to do.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|This movie is a T shirt for Nine Inch Nails.  The opening credits and score tells you right away what a sewer pipe Hollywood has become.  I threw this one into the trash -- back to the sewer pipe it goes.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Glad to see Paramount (based on their website at least) supports iTunes player for their digital copy. They also enable buyers the choice to use MS Media Player. Wish more did this. So sick of UV only options from other studios. I do ask that Amazon request this info from their suppliers as it makes a difference to many of us, particularly if you have been burned in the past.<br />[...]
B004DMNT2W|4.0|perfect size for our new sony cx380 camera ,has a little room to spare so can fit in a spare battery loose,and memory cards.there is a pocket for the sd cards ,ideally a pocket for a battery would be outstanding.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|Very close to the original - great dance movie! Not sure why I have to write this extra long review though.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|ever since you changed the weather channel. I have trouble with it coming up. I cant get the weather channel to see if there is bad weather or storms. iwish you would have never up grade the app.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I have been able to look up several words already to help me understand better what I am reading. Great!
1401323820|4.0|I like this book. I though the sex part better, but I was wrong.  One site that went to said chapter 11 will be the best.  But I read books more detail than book.  But I still like the book and will read next book.  I give the book B+.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|What is more fun then using gravity to blow up smug laughing pigs. As a recently retired American male, I strive daily to fill my time. In the evening the Kindle Fire and all of the books, movies, and apps get put to use. Once per night I struggle to obtain 3 stars and destroy the obnoxious laughing pigs. My wife and I never played video games until the granddaughters trained their grandmother. Now grandma is the raining champion and I, the GRANDFATHER, will not allow her to reign alone.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is my third Android phone and the Kindle app does nothing but improve.  I love, love, love my kindle (and kindle apps)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app I ever got. Well for now it is. When I First heard of minecraft I was afraid it would be more expense . But I'm glad it not!
B005UG542S|4.0|So Voldermort is the Darth Vader of the 21st century and Ralph Fiennes performance was my favorite in this film.  I think it was unnecessary to have the final film in two parts but that is a picky, minor point.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|I cannot get enough of this album!! I keep it on ALL day long! I love every song...amazing! Every time I listen to it, it brings me back to certain scenes from the movie. It could not be more perfect!
B0043WDK2G|4.0|I'm catching up with this series because I don't want to miss out watching the developing relationship between the two main characters (Beckett and Castle). Good plot twists, good characters, witty humor - I'm a fan.
B005ZMUXDC|4.0|Personally I love this movie. The story of Rapunzel with nice twist to it.Rapunzel has magic hair that heals. Her tower is invaded by a thief, Flynn Rider. She barters with him to take her on an adventure to see the floating lights. A palace horse is chasing after Flynn along with a couple man he back stabbed. The horse is hilarious. The music in this movie is amazing. Mandy Moore (Rapunzel) and Donna Murphy (Mother Gothel) have amazing voices and do wonderful jobs with the songs.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I enjoyed this film although I can't say it is one of my favorites. It does have a very real performance from Jennifer Lawrence and its plot with flawed characters makes for a well-made, down-to-earth film.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Just as the rating says, It was ok. I man in a traveling circus gets transported to the world of Oz. There he is mistaken for a great and powerful wizard when truly he is a trickster, an Illusionist. I often found the graphics lacking. Too often it looked like they were walking through a computer generated world. The story line was cute but not captivating. I found myself watching it just to finish what I started but it was fairly predictable.
B004WMKSH2|4.0|I think breaking this final story into two films was a bit of overkill. It could have been completed in one film with 3 hour length - but no matter - I'm being really picky on this point. I enjoyed it immensely and it wrapped up loose ends from the book rather nicely.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|In the book, Vonnegut criticizes war, politics, religion, and writing.  In his &#34;karass,&#34; I think I would fit - or maybe not.
B003TH14H4|5.0|I'm a late arrival to this series. I know it is entering its 6th season so it is great to be able to catch up with the earlier seasons on Amazon. The series is humorous, witty, and does provide interesting murder plots which the viewer can follow along and try to solve. There is usually some late, surprise plot twist that helps break the case.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I read a book or so every three days. This one filled me with laughs, tears, and open honesty. I feel like a lived a whole other life in reading this book. The end is quite a surprise.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Nothing is as good as experiencing for the first time the excitement of a hero's genesis and development.  This film was perfect IMHO as it contained all the elements in perfect balance (plot, editing, humor, good character development, music, special effects).<br /><br />Iron Man 2 I give 4 stars and Iron Man 3 - 5 stars. All are worth watching.
B0054YH8DY|5.0|I bought the legacy edition (2001) because I had the crummy sounding 80's CD and was delighted with the greatly improved audio.Listen to Paul light his cigarette at the start of Overs- his match is beautifully miked !
B008QTVNUI|5.0|In the beginning I usually watch a show if the actors involved are ones I admire. Claire Danes and Damian Lewis certainly fit that bill IMHO. However, Howard Gordon is a producer whose name has been appearing consistently in shows that I enjoy (The X-files, 24). So when I saw his name attached to this series, I knew it would it good and I wasn't disappointed.
B005HSL626|1.0|This is the worst game I ever downloaded in my entire life and when I tried to chop the fruit in half it didn't work and my score was 0
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Had action, humour....was pretty good.  I didn't like the violence though.  Could have gotten the story across with just a bit less violence.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|why can't we all have this guy's education and insight?<br />It's great (and voyeuristic) to see what we came from- it's getting dim with time. clear concise information, and lots of it
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Inspiring, encouraging and just great. I highly recommended especially for women who want to pursue a career and even for those who would like to be stay at home moms.
B003YVCJQ0|5.0|We have to watch Independence Day every year on the 4th of July, and since we just moved we haven't set up cable yet and you were able to give us our fill!! Awesome!!
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is an awesome movie. The characters are well rounded and the story was great. Disney did not properly advertise this movie and I hope that they will understand that fans are growing and we want a sequal!
147674355X|5.0|Just finished reading Hopeless... Just when I thought I knew what was going to happen next, there was a twist here and a turn there. This book keeps me wanting more! I can't wait until Colleen's next book comes out!<br /><br />P.S. I loved the &#34;hopeless&#34; story and finding out where that came from!
B000065V41|5.0|In this review, I am going to discuss a few things: the film itself, and the controversy and relative anger surrounding the inclusion and disclusion of the song \\"When Love Is Gone\\" from this film.<br />Aside from the Jim Carrey adaption, this is the most faithful film I've seen for the Christmas Carol, but yet they tamed it down enough so as to not frighten children beyond what they could handle.<br />When I saw this movie, I was touched deeply and enjoyed every single second of the film, and I would be a bloody liar if I didn't say that this movie was a touch emotional to me, as well, probably more than any other adaption, because the Muppets are so extremely cute, and to see Scrooge mistreat them at the beginning was a little bit sad for me to see.<br />This is a splendid film with miraculous music that I sing around the house year-round, some that, out of nostalgia, make me cry to hear those beautiful, talented voices singing them. My favorites are \\"Bless Us All,\\" and \\"Thankful Heart.\\" I have the soundtrack, on CD and my iPod, and I listen to the soundtrack literally YEAR-ROUND. I wouldn't be able to enjoy my Christmas without having this movie, as it reminds me constantly that you need to help the needy and love each other. As a Christian person, this is a movie that has great morales, and I deeply enjoy the story just as much. It humbles me when I read somewhere online that the author of the book, Charles Dickens, helped the homeless, and if one knocked on his door, he would allow them to come in and share a meal with him, which makes me want to support his works all the more. If you watch this movie, you will never, ever forget what's in the movie, and what it will teach you as you watch, and the emotions are strong - happy, and sad as well.<br />Now that I've gotten through my thoughts and my emotions on this film, I'd like to talk briefly of the controversy and anger that surrounds the popular \\"When Love Is Gone\\" segment from the film. From what I understand, it was in the film, but was removed for time purposes at the theatre, then restored on the VHS in some countries - it was in mine; my VHS has the song on it - and then it was removed from most DVD releases. Now, from what I understand, the fullscreen releases on DVD host this \\"deleted scene,\\" but it has yet to appear on the widescreen edition, and When Love Is Gone has not appeared on any Blu-Ray releases. I noticed a few reviews giving this one-star because of that, although I personally think it is unfair. Of course, I'm not here to attack anybody, I'd like to offer my insight to this: I'm not a fan of the song, personally, although I do believe that the part where it cuts, with Gonzo and Rizzo crying, and Scrooge asking the question to the Spirit, are empty without that song in there. I also think it's great that, on the DVD, we have the choice to watch the original theatrical (widescreen, without the song) version or the \\"extended\\" (fullscreen, with song) version of the film. As someone who's not a fan of the song, I prefer the widescreen version.<br />When it comes to this film, can you not watch the fullscreen version of this film if you want to watch this scene, if even for nostalgic purposes. Most people who have this movie on DVD and are upset that the widescreen version doesn't feature the song, also have the film on the original VHS, which was released in fullscreen. It would be just like flashing back to your childhood if you saw the movie in the fullscreen state. I don't have a \\"widescreen,\\" or \\"flatscreen\\" TV, nor do I ever have any desire to, because I enjoy having the \\"box\\" for the TV screen rather than the \\"rectangle\\" screen, and I will always support full screen. To me, widescreen isn't a very good format. But, if I could see this film in fullscreen without that song, I certainly would.<br />I'm sorry for rambling, but I feel very strongly about this film, and I hold it very dear to my heart, and I just wanted to let you all know how meaningful this film is to me. Merry Christmas (aww crap, it's only August...)
0394826817|1.0|I purchased the book as being used and in good condition.  The book that I received was written all over and was literally falling apart.  I instantly threw it away because it would not last a day.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is a great app. I just love the flow. This is the easiest app to use.  I used to use swype but SwiftKey is by far the best keyboard oar. To use for your phone.
B003VIWO8Y|3.0|I enjoyed the authors' use of family history and self deprecating style of abuse to pull himself out of an eternal rut.  I would recommend this book to any metal head who follows the metal genera.
B00BDSRKHO|4.0|Very enjoyable album from the boys-love metroland but why was not Helen of Troy released as a single! top song that cries top 40 all over it but thats the boys from the Wirral doing it the difficult way. Dresden, Kissing, Final song all very listenable but our system is superb and the bands favourite so that gives you an idea of their wavelength.<br />not bad for 4 50 plus year olds thats for sure-and lets hope it means there's still more in the tank so the future is not silent -thank you boys<br />and the B sides-no mans land is one of the all time best productions  and kill me is not bad either-should have been on the album
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've been playing Magic for a long time, since Unlimited. This is by far the best app I have on my Kindle Fire HD. I play all the time, especially when I can't play with my friends. It runs perfectly, no hiccups.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is a great find.  A book not many know about but I strongly recommend it.  One of the funniest books I have read in a long time.  Can't wait for Jonasson's next book.  I will buy it as soon as it comes out.
1573300403|5.0|MICHAEL JACKSON WAS SIMPLY AN AMAZING TALENT.  ONE NEED NOT LOOK BEYOND HIS VIDEOS TO COME TO THAT REALIZATION. I WAS NEVER REALLY A FAN BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY, BUT NOW, WHEN I VIEW THIS DVD COLLECTION, I SURELY AM.

B00A9ET4MC|4.0|I have not quite finished the book but I have greatly enjoyed getting a take on how an African woman deals with prejudice in America.  It is something as a white person, I don't think about, as an African it was not expected, but the reality is, it is there, prejudice for anyone with dark skin.
B004GYY714|5.0|I listen to music from Germany. There is nothing better than that, bringing a little bit of home in to my life.
140006922X|4.0|First and foremost, I love this book.  Even while disagreeing with some of the conclusions it draws, I think this book is highly successful in the following areas:<br /><br />1) While thoroughly researched, it presents a very readable account of not only the life and times of Jesus, but more importantly the historical elements and context in which he lived<br />2) It's \\"fresh\\" , i.e. while Aslan's positions are in no way completely original, I can't remember another recent source where they were as concise and open to a layman's understanding<br />3) He does a great job of examining really what it means to believe vs. acknowledge vs. develop ideas in the ancient world.  Far too often in the internet age we take for granted the wealth of information we have, and believe that just because some definitive source said some popular ruler or sect believed something that it was believed totally by everyone, completely forgetting the illiteracy rates, class structure, knowledge creep, local traditional influence/interpretation, and and other factors of history we take for granted.<br />4) His Notes section is excellent.  During this he provides details, clarifications, bib's/references, as well as competing opinions (imagine that).  I've already purchased 3 books from this section alone so I can refresh on some of the details myself.<br /><br />Aslan has done a great job presenting the historical Jesus divorced from the Gospels (as best possible), which so many writer's fail to do.  Granted, much of this is based on inference, and while I disagree with some of his, his logic is sound.  Despite what FOX news, fundamentalist/literalists, and other 'Oh wait you're a Muslim, what can you possibly know of Jesus' bashers would like to think, Aslan is essentially agnostic to the truthfulness of any God-issues, which is what good historians should be.  The book sets up the stage nicely, dividing it into roughly 3 sections - 1) Setting the stage/history of 1st century Palestine, 2)The life, death, and political persuasions of Jesus, 3) what happened afterwards - i.e., a primer for the development of early Christianity.  In all of these areas I think Aslan succeeds.<br /><br />Insomuch as I disagree with the book, I do so on the following points (possible ***spoiler*** alert):<br /><br />1) I see no reason to believe that the verse Matthew 22:15-22 (the famous, render unto Caesar verse) is the definitive political juxtaposition of Jesus that Aslan believes it is.  While it's true Jesus was (to me) obviously a Jewish radical for a number of reasons, using this as the Rosetta stone of his political affiliations to me is a little bit of a stretch<br />2) It seems he favors some sources for some things, but not so for others.  For example, in the 3rd part of the book he basically relocates the author of Luke to be lackey of Paul (I would agree), while at the same time quoting Luke in several instances in the book and throughout his (highly readable and entertaining) Notes section as authoritative, which would lead the people that catch it either confused or wanting<br />3) I think sometimes he stretches his assumptions, in kind of a 'Well this is the only way it makes sense' kind of way, but elsewhere (ex, the Notes section) provides alternative views that cast doubt on his own.  While this is admirable and honorable, it is also damning in some cases, at least when trying to make a convincing argument<br />4) It ends abruptly - I would've like to have a little bit more of an easing out considering the roll he was on...<br /><br />It should be noted though that #2 is essentially a criticism that I would make of a ton of historians, as many a good historian believe that their sources get some things right and some things wrong (ex, Josephus), but this does not discredit themselves en masse.  Aslan (and his use of sources) are no different, but it does raise at least a little bit of an eyebrow when coupled with #3 insomuch as making definitive arguments.<br /><br />All in all I think this is an excellent book, one that is highly readable and thoroughly researched.  In the areas that I am critical I am mainly because I disagree with some of his assessments and application, but not the wealth and depth of knowledge he presents on the subject.  If nothing else, this book has basically put me in a position of, 'Well...that makes sense....but 2000 years of other authors disagree [2000 years of some authors do agree, mind you], so let's see what they have to say'.  This opens the conversation, debate, and knowledge digging all over again, which is what great reads should do.  If for nothing else, that makes this book a huge success in that it empowers you to get out there and do what you should with any historical account: do your due diligence and go learn something for yourself.<br /><br />(PS - I'm not giving it high stars while disagreeing with it b/c I'm trying to be sophistic or bandwagon, I'm giving it high stars because of the above last paragraph - in that even where I do disagree, I think this book excels in all the important ways a good popular book can)
B009B8YZIK|5.0|The first time I watched this was on Netflix, but I liked it enough to buy it so I can watch it again. H4:FUD is back story, and I know a lot of people get bent out of shape when the story doesn't involved a certain Spartan. However, as an amateur writer myself, I really appreciate when a piece of a fictional universe expands on the norm, and this movie delivers. I did have fairly low expectations, and I've read that other prior-military people think this movie is stupid, but personally I think the point is how the events changed the main character, not how good a soldier he was in the beginning. Not to mention, enlisted personnel receive very different training from officers, so... knowing a lot about [modern] enlisted life, and a bit about commissioned, I have to say one's perspective may be very different from mine going into this movie.<br /><br />Take a step back, watch it once or twice, and think about it for a few days before you come to your final opinion. Taken as a piece of Halo back-story, I personally feel this film deserves some regard, even though it has just a little relation to the main storyline.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|First off, the writing style is easy to read, probably because the true author is a journalist. Second, if you want an indepth look at the actual mission, this is not the book to read. Thirdly, if you do, however, want to know how a SEAl is trained, this is for you because that's what the first half is all about.<br />He indicated he wrote this to inspire other teenage boys, as he once was inspired by a book in high school, to become a SEAL.<br />My big problem is that he broke the covenant not to reveal details about how our SEALS operate and in doing so has opened Pandora's Box. Plus, and this is a biggie, his real name was revealed by FOX news and now his parents could be the object of some terrorist who wants to make his mark.
B000O76T8Q|5.0|My husband had never seen this movie, and I realized you can't watch it on any legit services because of licensing issues or something, so I purchased the DVD and sat him down. His father even showed up about halfway through for something and ended up staying to watch the whole thing.<br /><br />Man, this movie was so awesome when I was a pre-teen/adolescent, and to be honest it has aged really well in my opinion. I was a bit shocked to read about the hardships the actors and crew went through to film it (check out the Wikipedia article!).<br /><br />The Abyss is part action movie, part thriller, lots of drama, a dash of political repercussions, and despite *some* dated imagery, I think it stands the test of time really well. Plus I got to revisit a younger Ed Harris which was tons of fun. Also, other than some mild profanity and a 'topless female' scene (aka the defibrillator scened), in my opinion this is movie that can be enjoyed with your pre-teen kids even now, possibly even more than current movies.<br /><br />Lastly - something that struck me while watching this is that the movie came out in 1989, yet we still have not achieved submersible drilling platforms such as the one featured in the film. It really was food for thought, if you follow that sort of thing.
1434475662|1.0|I had read another version of this that was just beautiful, you can find it on amazon here:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0553208845 Siddhartha Hermann Hesse]]<br /><br />But this version, with the sunset picture, is one of the worst examples of English writing I've ever read<br /><br />I'm sorry to be so negative, and I know my expectations may be too high, but this version of this book was a complete waste of money and time.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Every song on the album is very good.  However, Paparazzi and Poker Face make the album awesome.  I have really this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Free game, addictive and fun!!! Kids love it easy for them to play, when they're done GMa gets to play.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Good album made great by the \\"You and I\\" song with sampling \\"we will rock you\\" and Brian May on the guitar.  Awesome, awesome, song.
B003UESJEM|3.0|This movie epitomizes the Obama economy.  Most people watch movies as escapism<br />and this film is all to real.  It left me depressed with an ending that was<br />slapped on and did not feel believable in this economy.<br /><br />The parts were professionally acted because they had some big stars as well<br />as some newcomers.  It just was not entertaining so I would not recommend it.<br /><br />It is too brutally honest.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I bought this cd after seeing a video on YouTube and decided to use one of the tracks for my wedding. Absolutely beautiful music.... Love to listen to it now while I'm working.
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|It is kind of rare to see a movie with no sex in it.<br /><br />It is all New Age stuff homogenizing all religions<br />and very touchy feely.<br /><br />It had some decent stars and some mediocre acting.<br /><br />What it demonstrated best is how narcissistic and<br />self centered most of us are,  In that sense it<br />is a good movie illustrating our faults and leaving<br />me with the notion of having to do it better in the<br />future.  So for that reason I will recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I hate how they don't even have a free version of MINECRAFT uhhg frikin caps I don't have this game but I love it for the ipod and its awesome but I would really like it if they did
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This is now a fav movie of mine, almost up there with Monsters inc.  It's turns dark into sweet and had me fully engaged throughout.  Unique and a joy!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|First the philosophic basis for the film:<br /><br />After giving his lifeblood to the United States, Ethan Hunt and his team are disavowed to avert<br />career disaster; invoking 'Ghost Protocol.'<br /><br />Ghost Protocol is a standard 'Hunt for Red October' type of thriller. The other reviews have pretty much<br />given the movie away, so I will give three points.<br /><br />1. Ethan Hunt is really an MI6 in this film.<br />2. The Mexican IMF agent is based on a real lady I know of.<br />3. The analyst is also an MI6, none other than James Bond.
0452289963|5.0|Do you really know yourself, how your mind functions, the tricks of the ego?  If not, this book will open your true eyes to enable you to see what your mind is doing without you even noticing it.  Like the works of Leonard Jacobson, Tolle shows us how to see our mind and perceived existence from outside of the mind- to be the witness, and to change our lives in significant ways.  Indeed, to help change the world to a more peaceful place.  Where to start this process?  The only place to start is from within, with yourself.  I've been guided by many, but none have been as simple and as clear as Tolle and Jacobson.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I was looking for a good item and after searching around and reading review after review I came upon this one. I purchased it based on all the good reviews I read here, glad I did.<br /><br />Best thing I've bought in a long time.<br />Higly recomend....
0517543052|5.0|This is one of the most unique books I've ever read.  If you in your head thinking a lot, that's fine, for a time- just realize that if you're in the past and future world that of the mind, you aren't really here and now.  This book helps to open one into a much deeper level that many people don't even know exists.  Like Leonard Jacobson and Eckhart Tolle, Ram Dass can help point the way.
B000002H92|4.0|Enjoy this CD more than any other they did. Glad Amazon had this CD available. I can always count on Amazon for what I need.
B0094K35S6|5.0|What is the Matrix?  I think it's a metaphor for the grip that society has on us- we feel we can't go back to nature or escape society's very tight grip, and that's because it's by design, by &#34;government&#34;, those who want to control the means of extracting our energy to work for them.  If you watch this, you should be able to see what it's really trying to tell you.
B00A4FOWYQ|2.0|Bicoastal Canadian twins Tegan & Sara emerge from a four-year focus on other projects with their seventh LP, a glossy song cycle of sex, devotion, and heartbreak, heavy on the heartbreak. Beginning with the naughty promise of \\"Closer,\\" which voices a transgressive assertion of female sexual desire, the duo rapidly devolves into a string of whiny mash notes accentuated by tinny, synth-heavy instrumentation. One exception, \\"Shock to Your System\\" builds an enormous musical scaffold, from a tick-tocking bass-and-tom beat on the bottom to glimmering rhythm guitar on top. Plaintive torch song \\"Now I'm All Messed Up\\" comes up the most affecting, with the sisters trading off contrapuntal lyrics pleading, \\"Go if you want/please stay,\\" a sentiment echoed by longtime fans who miss the snarky, hipster angst of the group's earlier work.
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|Overall this album has been a pretty good listen.  There are some seemingly timeless dance songs on there, as well as a few surprises.  However, Daft Punk's use of pitch correction to make the &#34;robot-like&#34; voice can be a little droning.  This is especially true with the slower longs on the album.  In fact the best songs on RAM are the one's that don't use this pitch correction software (i.e. Get Lucky and Lose Yourself to Dance).  Overall this is one of the better albums to come out recently.  You'll be bobbing your head in no time.
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|bought this for a gift for a friend's 15 year old daughter and she loved it.  She started watching it right away.  She loves Dr. Who
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked this challenging game and I am excited for more levels to be released in the future. Please hurry.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|I ordered this movie for my son.  He loves trains and for months all I heard was unstoppable, unstoppable, and so on and so forth.  I finally found this movie at a great price from Hastings through Amazon.  needless to say he was very pleased and so was I.  A+++++++++++++++++
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app...easy to use<br />Use this on weekly basis at work and home.<br />Would definitely recommend it to anyone needing a basic go to calculator for everyday use.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|We watched this with our 8- & 11- year-olds and all of us enjoyed it. We rented from Instant Video but liked it enough we'll probably buy the blu-ray to experience the better graphics.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|One of the few movies I actually watched over and over...mainly during the holidays.  Kinda stupid but thats part of the creative charm.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Big comics fan here.  I really wanted to love this movie...I really liked it, but didn't love it. The director simply didn't spend enough time making us feel for the characters.  Great acting all around. Great effects/design.  Snyder should have realized that an epic character like Supes shouldn't be filmed with 'shaky cam' though.  I want this movie in my collection, but refuse to pay for a combo pack that doesn't include a digital copy.  Ultraviolet is a disgrace, and a big F-U from the studios to the fans that make them millions. Sadly, I will pass on this purchase.
B003VPWX6K|4.0|Ishiguro artfully describes the importance of a life well lived. The characters, while a bit sad, define their successes and failures so well through small comments and phrases and you are left with the belief that they have found a sort of peace and acceptance in their lives. We should all be so lucky.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has always captured me, since mid-school! I'm now twenty five and still look forward to his new releases! This book was very intriguing and got mr from the get go! This was also my first iPad book and I must say I enjoyed the different experience :)
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Visually stunning. Fantastic musical score. Interesting story. Different mini games keep you interested. Love the options &amp; the discrete hints. Wonderful play! Very happy with this game. Want more! Good job developers! Heralds &amp; huzzahs for Magic Academy!
B0061QD88S|4.0|This is another great Disney classic. Fun to watch throughout. If you are discovering it for the first time, it is a must see. IF you have seen it before and want to add it to the collection, it is definitely worth seeing again.<br /><br />Great movie.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I looked forwad to the end of the day so I could get home and start reading this book again. It was one of those that I wanted to know the ending but at the same time hated for the book to end.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|keeps you guessing till the end. I think I need to watch it a second time..DiCaprio is just a master!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|There is so much you can do with this game. Buy new horses, New equipment, compete, care for your horses...it's just awesome! This is my favorite game for my kindle.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|This DVD is especially clear, sharp, and vivid.  It tells the story of Christian persecutions during the reign of Nero, thirty years after the death of Christ.  All of the actors, especially Robert Taylor, Deborah Kerr, and Peter Ustinov, are masters of their craft.  In fact, I actually believe that this was one of the finest performances of Ustinov's career; he actually shows insanity to be the complex psychological disorder that it is. One feels sorrow and loathing for his Nero at the same time.<br /><br />  One feels that all of the actors stepped into their parts just as naturally as if they were putting on an old, comfortable pair of shoes.  If you like Biblical epics from the early 1950's, with panoramic photography, authentic costumes, and great dialogue, this is for you.  The brutality of Nero toward the Christians is tastefully told without having to resort to gratuitous sex and violence at any time, which makes the entire film family-friendly.  Some dramatic license is taken with the characters, but not enough to damage either the overall quality of the film or the historical significance of the period.  Buy it; you will not be disappointed.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I find this game to be fun and challenging, and definitely addicting.  I wish there were more ways to earn rewards more quickly.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|What can I say, Denzel at his best again as he has done in so many of his movies. Great movie!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game. little expensive but has a lot of detail. creepy story line. good graphics.played well on fire.G5 makes great games. just wish they weren't so expensive.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Dated, preposterous, and silly, but lots of fun.  Especially love all the scenery from around Astoria and Cannon Beach Oregon.
B002WY65VU|3.0|Stop sending me &#34;rate this title&#34; emails.  I bought this as a gift.  I told you that when I bought it. That should be the end of it.  I don't see why i have to write a dissertation about it.
1401942601|5.0|I just got these cards today. I did a few readings and they are very accurate. The flowers on the cards are pretty and nicely photographed. I love the messages and find them unique from Doreen's other decks. I think this is a must have if you like Doreen's decks.
B0006A9FKA|3.0|Stop sending me &#34;rate this title&#34; emails. I bought this as a gift.  I told you that when I bought it. That should be the end of it.  I don't see why i have to write a dissertation about it.
B009I2UH2W|3.0|Technically I have the version for the iPhone 4 with the adapter but physically it looks the same.  After two years of use the casing started to peel which exposed the wires and they snapped.  I'm not hard on my things, but the way it's designed the weight of the phone must have been too much for the charger (and I usually had it sitting on the passenger seat, console or my lap so it wasn't being jostled around).  I now have to replace the charger and won't look at this model style again.  Since it worked for two years one could argue I got enough value, hence the three stars, but I feel it should have lasted longer.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is my favorite  bingo game out there. However I went out on a limb and actually purchased bingo tokens that I never received. They did contact me but made it almost impossible to give them everything they requested for my refund. Hell, money in their account and not mine just wasn't. Good enough. With that said, I would recomend the game just don't spend your money in the store.
B0053O89WY|4.0|As I enjoy this show I was pleased with the set, except there was one error on one of the disks where the picture was disrupted and the sound was messed up.
1401938906|5.0|This stuff really works, and I plan to keep up the exercises suggested. My experiments took a bit longer than suggested, but not much....read this book!
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|Unless I missed something obvious.....there is no way to exit......in using a kindle fire HD 8.9... I hadn't been able to figure it out so I had to uninstall
1600247245|4.0|Mr. Connelly is a fantastic writer.  Every book is as fresh and fascinating as the last.  Unlike some writers who allow success to soften their resolve and begin just hacking out a book to satisfy their publishers.  Mr. Connelly writes each book like it is his first.  I found not mistakes in plot, story line or characterization.  This book like all of his books is worth reading.<br />The seller was prompt and efficient in their delivery.  I will buy other books from them.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I have been reading the books and decided to watch Game of Thrones to see how true to the books it was. I thought it stayed pretty true I had a very enjoyable day watching season 1.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Lets me know my Kindle isn't holding a charge!  I see others have commented on this subject so now I have proof that there is a problem.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|This movie was better than I expected, and scarier, too. It relies on suspense and shock value than gore to scare you, and it was very well done. I'm not a huge Ethan Hawke fan but he did a great job with this role. Definitely worth the watch for horror fans with a super-creepy ending!
1601251505|5.0|Well worth the price.  All of the information you need to begina pathfinder/ old school rpg.  The expanded rules are easy to comprehend and provide enough player options for a rich and exciting campaign.  This is what 4th edition D&D SHOULD have been.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Based on a true story, this was a really good movie. Nothing 'gross' is shown but the illusion is there so may be a little tough for younger kids but its truly worth viewing. We all need a reminder NOT to give up when life gives us lemons.  Good for ALL, with or without kids.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This game is the kindle version of &#34;Wings Over Europe.&#34;  I wish WoE had the same depth as SF, with all of the choices of aircraft to fly.  I wish they just had a sub campaign for Vietnam and Korean Wars.  This games exceeded my expectations for a tablet game.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|It's a shame but cartoons aren't even 'safe' anymore for kids to watch unsupervised. However, this is a very good \\"family\\" movie with good values. I'd recommend it to anyone ~ especially with kids.  Our Friday nights are \\"Pizza and a Movie Nite\\" when we all curl up in the den together, usually with 'homemade' pizzas (I cheat with store bought crusts) so each can use their own chosen toppings.  This movie was perfect for the occasion.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Disturbing and poignant read.  Characters are fascinating with the changes they had to go through.  Glad Katiness and Peeta survived.
B008J34466|5.0|Great CD to listen to when driving. Up beat music to stay awake and sing along with! Just love it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I hate it when a series ends, but I guess it has to stop somewhere. No stones were left unturned...the third book wrapped up the first two and it had several surprises I didn't see coming. I like it.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|if you like 3D you will love this very nice well made  3D FANTASTIC .<br />on a par with the best<br />it did meet my expectations<br />no problem with delivery as usual
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it till the end.  Not sure I know how to take the end of that season and if I want to see the next.  I'm sure I will.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The books are simply amazing, fans of the show will not regret buying them. They are all POV books and they're very nicely written.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Have friends over and they recommended me to this game. At first I thought it would be just like temple run but it's way different. First five minutes I was playing I was instantly sucked in. This game rocks : )
B006VJMZXY|4.0|One of the pleasures of reading the novel is that it has been seriously and extensively researched, so it is based on fact. The authors also describes the chaos of how England was governed in medieval times, and the uncertainty of the lives of those who sought power. I enjoyed it immensely.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|It seems like we received this almost the next day. The movie is a hit, everyone really likes it - even the kids!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I don't care what everyone says, this is still my favorite movie.<br />If you haven't watched this movie you definitely should.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game because it doesn't push you into buying stuff and usually in a couple games I have u have  to earn bones or stuff like that in this game it would be the acorns but it's really nice because u can earn them it  not hard to get them to buy stuff and the whole is juts wonderful I love it I recommend for young children all the way up to adults I really enjoy this game and I think u would too:)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for any animal lover. It is realistic and very addicting. In my opinion this is one of the best games I've ever played. And FREE.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook quit working for  a few days but then I removed it and redownloaded it. Now it works fine. I'm really happy that I can have Facebook always on hand though.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is the funnest game of bingo that I have. The support is top of the line. For the best real feel of the game I highly recommend Bingo Blitz. I've been playing bingo games for a long time. This is the best that I have found.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am enjoying using FB with my Kindle Fire HD. I only wish that I had a camera that took pictures!!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|So much fun,like a modern day Tetris.challenging levels and different game modes make it super fun. Definitely recommend this game.
B0040HO16S|3.0|Bought all seasons and just finished watching Season 1. It was quite a disappointment, perhaps because I expected something as interesting as Downton Abbey. Although self-contained episodes are fine, knowing this was a long series, it was jarring to have characters front and center for one episode, then disappear (the school teacher, the feisty work-house housekeeper, etc.) And the plots were like I Love Lucy episodes where people kept going in and out of doorways, just missing each other (the lost parcel, the misplaced love poem.) And there wasn't much consistency in some of the townspeople -- the Pratt Sisters were rude and uppity to Dorcas many times, yet seemed on intimate terms at other times (plus, why do the Pratt Sisters wear clown outfits so often; do they moonlight for a carnival?) And, I love Dawn French, especially her Vicar of Dibly series, but, really? I was sad the debtor's prison didn't throw that key away.<br /><br />Maybe it'll get better. Can't get too much worse.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It works great... when the forever and a half of loading finishes, and you can't work with any options until it finishes loading.... overall some loading tweaks to it and it would be great
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I use this app only once per week at home.  On days I do not go to the gym, it gives me a great little work in the privacy of my own home.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its good game. easy to PLAY can advance. I recommended. good graphic and options. you don't need to be on Internet wich is really good
B001M3PQGM|4.0|I first saw this on TV and got caught up In the story. Its always enjoyable to me to watch these old classic movies. Although they don't have all the crazy special effects they are great for the time they were made in.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is just incredible:<br />- Incredible sound!<br />- Microphone handles background noises properly.<br />- No need to mess with the settings too much.<br />- Voice morphing!!!!!!<br /><br />... And more... I recommend!
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Great actors! Great Story! Can't wait for the next! He did a much better job on this first installment of this book than on the LOTR series! Hopefully this trend continues!
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I have had the withings pulse which also tracks steps, for less than a week.  I charged it on Thursday, clipped it onto my bra on Friday and by Tuesday, it was dead without any warning!  Monday night my steps were showing on the face of it but when I looked yesterday, everything was gone. The worst part is that it had not synced since FRIDAY!!! so the info was lost.  I cannot figure out how to enter my steps manually either.<br /><br />This product is called PULSE so I assumed that taking my pulse would be easy but it is not at all, at least not while it is in the clip.  The sensor for the pulse is on the back which is completely covered when in the rubber clip.  So while I am exercising, I have to take the pulse OUT of the rubber clip, risking that I damage, lose, or forget it later, just to put my finger on the back.  Don't believe the first reading either- take it several times.  Mine ranged from 187 at rest to 80 to 63!<br /><br />I am very disappointed, since I really do like the withings scale.  Maybe I have a dud or I am missing something very obvious. If it is the latter, I will update this but for now, save your money.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|It was an okay story, not what I expected. But the action was pretty good. I haven't been a big fan of Tom Cruises recent films but he does as good of a job as expected given the story. You aren't likely to get bored but don't expect many academy awards out of this one.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|The &#34;Rhythm&#34; set shows Buddy with some great up-tempo tracks, spoilt only by a gratuitous and over-the-top appearance by Kid Rock on &#34;Messin' With the Kid&#34; (seek out any version that Buddy did with Junior Wells for how hard this song can rock).  The &#34;Blues&#34; side really shines, with an appearance by most of Aerosmith on &#34;Evil Twin&#34; and an absolutely stunning &#34;Blues Don't Care&#34; with Gary Clark Jr.  &#34;I Came Up Hard&#34; is another good autobiographical tune from Buddy, and &#34;Too Damn Bad&#34; just leaves a smile on my face.  Buddy's been on a roll over the last dozen years or so, and this just keeps it rolling.
B00D37UP4S|4.0|Entertaining and oddly uplifting science fiction film with a bit of romance thrown in for fun.  Got to watch it twice.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|great family movie! funny and heart warming and hey, who doesnt love the combo of Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman?
B00555X8OA|5.0|I'm only part way thought, but so far it is a wonderful book full of information that is atypical and useful.  The question is, will people who read this book be able to take advantage?
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This is a good game I just wish it was a dollar or two cheaper then it would be more worth the money
B002BVQU5A|3.0|I rate this movie 3 stars because I felt it was difficult to follow the story line. Perhaps it was intended for somone younger than 74.
B008LVCKH6|4.0|This book was a little &#34;Forrest Gumpish&#34; in its premise, but there were numerous scenes that made me laugh out loud. Altogether an enjoyable read.
B008S2BZ10|5.0|Perhaps a bit dated now, but this action/sci-fi classic was the first of it's kind, and the film that launched both Arnold Schwarzenneger and James Cameron into cinema juggernauts they are today. Despite it's outdated special effects and cheesy car chases, the Terminator remains as terrifying today as it was in 1984.<br />&#34;I'll be back.&#34; Says Schwarzenneger when he returns as the Terminator in action epic, T2:Judgment Day<br />Unfortunately he's also back in T3: Rise of the Machines...which is a truly awful film.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|One of the better Magic games I've played. I started playing in beta and put the crack pipe down, but this isn't a bad gateway. Needs to move faster.
B00E8B1358|3.0|If you have a fever, you feel dizzy, you often come in and out of consciousness, you can't move from your bed, and you've watched literally everything else on Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon, you might enjoy this ridiculous barrage of action nonsense.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|i love this game because it is so detailed and so cute and fun to play. i just love it and i highly recamend it
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|Interesting and entertaining enough to watch Halle Berry, Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving, and a host of other wonderful actors portray a multitude of characters, interwoven into one story that spans half a millennium. It falls a little short in that the connection between the stories never reaches any profound conclusion; we see how they are related, but the total impact is never fulfilled. Aside from that, the other pitfall is the departure from the traditional arc, when the film fails to reach a climax.
B005544V6A|4.0|The story lines are not realistic, but it is entertaining and you can't help but like and two main characters, Harvey and Mike.  I'm hooked.
B008Y6TE5O|5.0|Amazing blend of top-tier 90's action mixed with intelligent satire of the genre. McTiernan delivers one of the best Schwarzenneger flicks, in the prime of his career.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|West Wing is one of my favorite series of all times.  I don't normally purchase TV series, but I enjoyed this so much I wanted to keep it.  I understood a lot more about politics from watching this show.
B001609SQA|5.0|James Cameron picks up where Ridley Scott left off, with our heroin Lt. Ripley, now as a super badass, hellbent on ridding the universe of those pesky aliens, once and for all.
B001RIY4WE|1.0|I have tried this Blu-ray in two different Blu-ray players and it won't play.  In the Sony, it shows a blank screen until 00:00:23 and then stops.  I've read other's with certain Sony models that have had the same experience.<br /><br />In my Panasonic, it pops up a dialogue that says that my player doesn't have enough memory and will not play the disc.<br /><br />All my players have the most current firmware.
B00CATSONE|4.0|The information about Tesla was fascinating and I enjoyed it. However, I thought the pep talk on creativity and &#34;genius&#34; was a big exaggerated. Not EVERYONE can access the kind of mental powers he had. However, that said, the author does make good points about creativity and intelligence, and the story of Tesla himself is excellent.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|I bought this set for my granddaughter for her 10th birthday. She is an advanced reader and she's thrilled with the books. It is difficult to get her to put it down.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|Good stuff.  This sounds like Metallica again.  A good followup to death magnetic.  It is almost as it's one continues project.<br /><br />Buy it today.
B0000844M8|5.0|I was very pleased with my purchase of &#34;Born Free.&#34;  DVD was in very good condition and a great value for what I paid.  I enjoyed watching the movie soon after it arrived.  Arrived in a very short time after I placed the order.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|This is the album that should have come after the Black album.  Just try to put Load,Reload and St Anger out of your mind like they never happened and pick this up.  This is a Metallica album!  It would be wonderful if this album would be remastered but this will do for now.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I loved the different story lines and how the season ended.  I've already watched Season 3 so I hope they put up Season 4 soon!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is addicting.  I can't put it down, the only reason I do is when my Kindle's battery dies.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game really gets my brain thinking I love playing it all day everyday<br />If I could I would play it in my sleep
B000005AYM|5.0|I loved this album from beginning to end!! The jazz influences are so noticeable and the soul is definitely there!! It is so deep and so smooth at the same time! I love Erykah Badu!
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|Very nice little game.  I like that it has 4 separate game ratings instead of just three.  Only thing is sometimes, when I exit a game after completion and then the app, it seems like the timer still goes and when I go back into the app, it asks me if I want to resume the game.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|If you are a fan of the previous Tedeschi Trucks albums this one tops them both.  It's got as much energy as any studio album I've heard.  In the vein of Mad Dogs and Englishmen, Delaney and Bonnie, Derek and the Dominos... but with stronger vocals, guitars and horns.  Everyone in this 11 piece group is an absolute master of their craft.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|I was disappointed with the conclusions drawn to end this voluminous work. I don't think that Jordan would have ended it that way. Of course it might have been an attempt to set up a sequel. H Register
B002XTXG1G|5.0|The dvd was in excellent shape, the movie is amazing, i've already watched it a billion times! Thank you very much for an outstanding product!
B000VZYPB4|4.0|I didn't watch this series when it came out but have grown to appreciate the nerd/geek in all of us that relates to this series.  My children and I have spent hours laughing and re-quoting these.<br /><br />My only complaint is there are a lot of sexual references that are just not needed.  We've skipped a few episodes that seem to focus on that.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|I was very pleased with this dvd, the product is in excellent shape and i enjoyed watching this movie for the first time!
B006S043TA|3.0|The story was ok but they could have done a lot more to tie things together and offer back stories.  A lot of special effects seemed to be for the sake of special effects not the story.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|When I first started, I didn't know what an emoji was. It didn't take long to figure it out. This game is easy enough to find some answers, and hard enough to make you have to think. Great pastime.
014241543X|4.0|If I Stay was strongly recommended for me by my friend. I finished this book within two days, and could not put it down! The story is about a 17 year old girl named Mia, who is in a devastating car accident with her parents and younger brother. The accident leaves Mia in grave conditions, while taking away the rest of her family. Throughout the book, Mia is watching herself from outside of her own body, and has to watch her loved ones visit her while her body is laying in a hospital bed. Her aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents are all worrying about her, along with her best friend Kim, and her boyfriend Adam. Adam and Mia met through their love of music, Adam who plays the guitar and Mia, who plays the cello. They have a very special kind of relationship, not your typical high school fling. After just a few days of being in the hospital, Mia realizes that the choice between life and death is in her hands. She learns that she can either choose to go with her family, or live a painful life without them. In the end, Adam saves her life by reminding her of their powerful love. I feel that this book could have been better in the sense that while reading it, I did not get as emotionally attached to the characters as I usually would while reading a book like this. However, it was a very intriguing book that I would definitely recommend to a friend. All in all, If I Stay was a very interesting book and I am glad I chose to read it.
159315724X|5.0|Love this book, it has completely changed my life. Passed it on to my friends and family and now they are reaping the rewards as well.
140006922X|5.0|Whatever one's faith there is great insight into who was the man Jesus, really?<br />After reading then decide for yourself.
0385512058|3.0|First couple of chapters were interesting and provide insight but once the author starts adding names of people he knows and expressing in so many ways how great he is and how he made it out of nothing though he went to Ivy league his whole schooling does not help the cause on this book. You have to pick and choose what good message (maybe 40%) you get from this book and do not waste time on the rest. There are better books to read and this is not one of them.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|Usually love Harry Hole stories, but this one dragged a bit for me.  It just didn't feel as tight as most of Nesbo's other work.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|An inspiring story of true honor ( not just the main \\" miracle\\"...it is a true shame that our society is losing these hero's to time!!) . I am truly thankful to God for men/authors like Adam Makos , who are saving our history ,one word at a time ! Simply a \\"must read\\" for any military history buff !!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is very good I love the characters it is a drama with a little humor at times.<br /> It is well directed and very believable. I have a different view of lawyers now. And also prosecuters it's not always black and white.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|If anyone ever asks me for a book recommendation, this is one of 3 books that springs immediately to mind. Unless, of course, the person asking is a guy. Because that's not going to work.<br />I LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this book. I laughed, I cried, I blushed! The characters are so deep and so well-written that I felt like I actually knew them and was experiencing their heartache first hand.<br />JoJo Moyes deserves a prize. Or two. Or as many as she can fit on her mantle - based on this book alone!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|my favorite parts are that it tells you how long till its fully charged and how long u can do certain things beforebit dies. love this app.
B00371V6SE|5.0|AGAIN I say: READ it, don't just watch the movie!!!<br />Beautifully written, this story really got under my skin - for all the right reasons.<br />Mr Sparks is a genius!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A fast read and goes into the mind of a girl..crazy girl and outthinks everyone and in the end all survive...well written and I understand they are making a movie about this...
B0064BWE8U|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella. Adore her books. I do find, though, that there is a split in her books. I absolutely adore one and then the next is only so-so. It is very strange, almost as though two different people are writing her stories.<br />My favourites are: Can you keep a secret, I've got your number, The Undomestic Goddess & Remember me. 5 stars for all!<br />Twenties Girl, Wedding Night, not so much, and I must admit, I found the Shopaholic series a little tedious.
0061537969|5.0|This book was a wonderful story told through their beloved dog. It was touching and very heartwarming. Being a dog owner it really was a great read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is definitely a young adult read. I enjoyed it tremendously, it took me back to the time when love was overwhelming and intoxicating and your hormones are running riot!<br />The characters were well-developed and the story was stunning.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to YA readers, although less so to their adult counterparts.<br />I did feel that the story was tied up, though and did not feel any urge to download the companion novel - losing Hope.
0393061310|5.0|the books arrived as expected. the service was great. Not reading it yet, as I bought two books, but this seems to be above expectations. thanks.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|My Inner Goddess says that this book deserves a 5, while my conscious screams and rattles her chains, crying &#34;NOOOOOOOO!!!!&#34;<br />I give this book 5 stars because Christian Grey is just too sexy for words, and because I COULD NOT put it down.<br />Okay, so its not exactly literature, and Ana is irritating as all hell, but it is addictive, and for that EL James deserves 5 stars. Not that she needs them, I'm sure she is laughing all the way to the bank at the 1 star reviews.<br />This book became a cult phenomenon and it made many men VERY happy. So 5 stars it is!
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and it was a very sad look at society in the future. It is all about the pretty people and when you reach a certain age, Then to happily go into an area and be disintegrated - please! This was a great movie on perception and reality and rebellion. I found this entertaining and interesting especially at the end when all of these young people see their first old person.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I do not like this new Christian. He is not the man I &#34;fell in love with.&#34;<br />Bring back the bad boy!
B00BP0O7QW|3.0|The author describes a year in Charlie's life through letters that he writes to an unknown person.  It's delightfully well done and quickly read. Charlie is bright and articulate, a high school freshman with the emotions of his age and an understanding that reflects his age level.  Like so many others, I did enjoy this read.  However, as I lay the book aside, I asked myself how any one boy could experience all the events that are chronicled in the letters within a year.
B003X27L9U|5.0|This is the second of 3 books that spring to mind whenever someone asks me for a reading recommendation.<br />I once tried to write in the mind set of a fifteen year old girl and scrapped the book after 3000 painful words.<br />How Emma Donoghue managed to write this entire book through the eyes of a child is beyond me - the rarest, truest talent.<br />This book really got under my skin, and stayed with me for days, weeks even. I couldn't stop thinking about it. It is so cleverly written and so poignantly heart wrenching, without being unbearable.<br />I would actually read this book again, just to convince myself that it's not too good to be true!
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|So-so movie.  Video quality was adequate for streamed rental.  Was expecting more fantasy/horror imagery.  Didn't live up to its hype.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|I really struggled to finish this one. The first had already pushed all the boundaries and Christian's slow evolution into a new-age sensitive man didn't do it for me.<br />I like him B.A.D!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|great music history movie that is full of in depth characters, like Paul McCarthy and several other famous rock stars.
B00BESKTMG|5.0|I love this movie really enjoyed from beginning to end love these type of video and Lucy Lu always rocks would recommend highly for watch
B009SCRERI|5.0|this is a good family movie to watch with your favorite little princess :) especially on rainy days or cold nights
B009XIXVU6|5.0|In a way a story about how hard and injust life can be, a remainder to enjoy yours and be thankfull for what you have.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|The game started out really well and after a certain point you have to unlock the full game, which I decided to do. Big mistake! It let me get to chapter 7 and the game crashed and I could no longer play it after multiple attempts. And to make matters worse when I reported an issue with the app and went to write a review on the unlocked game it wanted me to pay for it again, so it was like I never even bought the game. Do not even bother with this one!
140006922X|5.0|Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth by Reza Aslan is a New York Times bestseller, and one hell of a book.  For one thing it is well written, for another the author knows his stuff and he makes his case convincingly.  Much has been said (primarily by the now infamous Fox News reporter) about the audacity of a non-Christian writing about Jesus.  But when the author is as knowledgeable and objective as Aslan, the question should be: `Who could be better?'<br />If you are a Christian, this book should not be offensive as the author makes no effort to attack matters of faith.  He rigorously explains the actual environment that Jesus lived and died in.  Like many I was raised as a Christian and so thought I had a basic idea regarding Jesus' life.  This book is like reading the adult version of a favorite fairy tale.  As an adult it is fascinating to learn more about what's historically known about Jesus and his milieu.  Equally interesting is discovering what is not factual or historically possible in New Testament accounts. Oddly, finding out that early Christians had conflicts about how the church should develop (should only Jews be accepted?), added to my sympathy for the Christian faith.<br />Reza Aslan was born in Teheran.  His nominally Moslem family immigrated when he was seven to the U.S.  He has multiple graduated degrees in just the subjects needed to write this excellent book. He lives in Hollywood, but that's all he has in common with the Shahs of Sunset!
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I was a purchase that I didn't need. I erred when buying the charging unit by thinking I needed the cable. In reality the cable that came with the Kindle was sufficient.
B000002LK1|5.0|This was always my favorite Depeche Mode album.  I first had it on cassette and needed to upgrade.  Doesn't disappoint.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The book is a helpfull summary of what took place in the first world war. I never enjoyed reading history books, but presented in this way, it held my attention.<br />My wife read the book and said that I would enjoy it. Now I plan to read the second in the series.
B000002UWE|5.0|I read a glowing review of this album and took a shot.  I was not disappointed.  The first seven songs were their 80s sound, the last seven songs were a newer, different and really enjoyable sound.
B006DGOV9Q|4.0|the battery arrived on time, it works well, and gives a long working time, i really liked it and happy with it.<br />thank you.<br />the only thing i didnt give 5 stars that the packaging is just a plastic bag and not in a box. but still fine : )
B008BGNMZU|5.0|I've been a fan of Fourplay for many years and this doesn't dissapoint.  I'm grateful for the excellent addition to my smooth jazz collection.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|Dracula is an interesting book. At times it gets confusing, but overall you need to determine foreshadowing. Make sure to set time to read this entire book.
B00008G8LG|5.0|I love this movie.  I love the colors, the beauty and the music.  Chow Yun-Fat and Jodie Foster were excellent choices for the parts they played.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Boy lost girl, boy finds girl, resists while an intriguing plot unfolds around them. I especially love the song she sang &#34;Don't Put the Blame on Me Boy&#34;. A very entertaining storyline.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Bubble Blaze is a real cute bubble match game with little dragons flying around.  Is easy yet challenging.  If you like bubble match games you should like Bubble Blaze.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Now watched all 3 seasons of the Walking Dead! I can't get enough of it. Too bad we will have to wait for season 4 begin releasing in October! It's worth the wait though!
0062127241|5.0|Very interesting read - very informative and well written.....if ya like Townsend and the Who you well love the book.
B00EEXST2K|4.0|this is a film with excellent acting and noble intentions, and tells an almost mythical tale of a woman's rise and fall and redemption. the astonishing thing is that the story is real, and we're shown the costumes and sets, excerpts from newscasts and television shows, musical hits of the era to prove it. what's sorely missing, however, especially for viewers born after 1970, is a depiction of the historical predicament of women in the years of early feminism. when two police officers interrupt an abusive episode between lovelace and her husband, and she fails to ask for help, one officer actually asks her for her autograph. the scene doesn't read right unless the viewer is aware that the duty of police to intervene in domestic disputes was not established by law at the time and wouldn't seem to the officers the \\"correct\\" thing to do; she wouldn't ask for help knowing those facts. worse, there is no reference to contemporary feminist developments, even though the meager plot of \\"deep throat\\" turns on its heroine's demand that she enjoy sex as much as men.<br /><br />without being lurid, the film dissects the depravity of an abusive marriage, the husband alternating between affection and violence. because this is the part of an abused woman's life often hidden from outsiders, the film tells a large arc of the linda lovelace story \\"from the outside\\", as served up by the film publicity events, then reprises the key scenes with \\"the rest of the story\\" -- how each of them turned violent or degrading or manipulative. a judgmental mother and ineffectual father fail to help her; she doesn't reach out to her closest friends; investors only see her as a product ... which leaves her husband chuck traynor to use her however he pleases. the mystery is why she put up with it so long -- for that you have to look to the expectations placed on her by her mother and her catholic upbringing, the coercion and threats from her husband, the allurements of fame, but most of all her naivecompulsion to please and be loved.<br /><br />the principals are excellent. peter sarsgaard is almost satanic as the slimy, manipulative, cynical and cowardly husband, cruel to his wife and fawning to men with money, and there's a fine supporting cast to play the pygmies of the porn industry. a scene near the end, when lovelace's parents see her phil donohue interview on TV and finally grasp what their daughter has suffered and their complicity in her affliction, is sad and very powerful. amanda seyfried is convincing where innocence and earnestness are called for, and her natural sweetness comes through in many scenes, but lovelace's real pain is fully revealed only once, in a late night plea to her mother for shelter, and it comes before we see much of the abuse she suffers and seems unmotivated as we watch it. (a later rape scene is also presented without sufficient buildup, so it is shocking but less painful to watch than it should be.) at other moments of desperation or despair, seyfried seems bewildered, as if unsure what the two directors wanted from her -- more likely they were unsure themselves, or how they should handle the script. despite all that, seyfried and sarsgaard give gutsy, ambitious and engrossing performances.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy Mr. Rollins' books that always include so much fact, science, and historical perspectives.  His writing, with all that it encompasses, always keeps the reader enthralled. The Sigma Force characters are some favorites as well. Looking forward to the next adventure.
0143124544|5.0|Difficult subject matter, but the author handled it deftly. I will be ruminating for a long time about how the handicapped are perceived , but more so about I should be \\"living\\", while I'm still alive and kicking!
B005I64U5C|4.0|I almost didn't even bother to watch this film because of all the bad reviews, but since I have Netflix I thought why not.<br />I'm glad I did I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.  The story line was pretty good, the special effects were great so I ended up buying the 3D version and have lent it out to several of my friends and everyone really liked it!  It goes to show don't always take the reviews you read as gospel, everyone has a different opinion and theirs might be opposite of yours.
B003G94BZC|5.0|This is a fun and exciting episode to end Matt Smith's first season as the Doctor.  Highly recommended for all Doctor Who fans.
140006922X|5.0|Jesus Christ or Jesus of Nazareth, zealot, redeemer, or both?  Enter a book, Reza Aslan's Zealot. Fuel on the flame?  Actually, the book is quite tame.  The virgin birth?  A fairy tale.  We already knew that.  Still, it's a great story and one to be celebrated.  The confrontation with Pilate?  It never happened.  Messiahs in first century Palestine?  Messiahs aplenty.  Then why is Jesus the Christ and the others dust?  Zealot answers that question, and for that answer alone, it merits careful scrutiny.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Read this for the ending of book one. You can skip the middle book unless you want more hot, steamy unconventional sex acts
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I've only heard some of the songs on the radio prior to buying this cd and now enjoy listening to the whole CD.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Certainly a hot, steamy but unrealistic book. Fast reading. I thought this was a single book but it is a series. Skip the second and just go to the third for the ending.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This really is a wonderful game. One of my favorites. I like this format better than the one on my iPhone. It is much larger and easier to see which makes it more fun.
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|...and that would be a sad, sad thing.<br /><br />AAA games have so much to offer in terms of story and depth and, for many of them, music as well.  The soundtrack to Last Of Us is very somber, introspective and intrinsically sad, yet it weaves in and out of the game without announcing its presence with any loud fanfare or to punctuate a frightening moment.  It's exactly the treatment that the game deserves and matches the tragedy and pacing of the story beautifully.  One might be even forgiven for not remembering much of a soundtrack at all, but listening to those CDs did elicit quite a few \\"oh yeahhh\\" moments of recognition.<br /><br />While I'm not sure if the full soundtrack is included or not, this soundtrack SOUNDS complete to me and is pleasant to listen to and helps to bring back memories of a phenomenal game that few should miss.
B000FC1192|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, so I thought I'd pick up the book. Like all of Gaiman's work, the book is incredibly well written -- short, clear sentences and haunting descriptions. Not too scary for older kids. It's a fun book.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I delayed reading the book because I thought the story had been worn thin and had evolved too slowly. Then I decided I should finish the trilogy. The plot is more interesting than I had expected, and I was glad that the book revealed how the evil of the games and the domination of human will retards the normal development of good people.Collins is good at making situations seem real.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Really good read, very well written and paced all in all a very good book, and I can't wait for the movie
B0041D843M|3.0|This is a big study but it has some huge flaws. I suspect the goal of the book was established before the study to convince people that meat is bad. Boiled down it says Chinese eat vegetables and don't have heart problems like meat eaters. The book mentions South America as big meat eaters and high heart problems. It doesn't bother to tell you that the medical community had a 44% drop in heart problems withing a year because they instituted better medical practices and not less meat eating. There are countries where almost nothing but meat is eaten but this study leaves them out. Personally I eat very little meat, especially red meat and may not see a piece of chicken for weeks. This is really a one sided book and those against meat eating will love it.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Truly enjoyed this series and watched it up to the 4th but was left hanging.  Wish the TV stations wouldn't do this all the time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My absolute favorite game in the world ....highly recommend. I Like the realistic quality of the horses. Its fun and it will just have to do till I get my real horse
159562015X|5.0|Seeing my top 5 strengths was very interesting. Reading about them is even more interesting. I shouldn't have waited 10 months to do this.
B00280LYHS|3.0|Good loss of fun to read over the summer vacation Lhasa this is dumb i hate u h I'm done
B00992CF6W|5.0|U need to fix something cause every time I take a stick leather or iron it counts as 16 iron<br />Plz fix
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it. it keeps me guessing and using my mind. it keeps my mind fresh and young. it makes me think.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It would be nice if the &quot;opportunities&quot;to spend real money could be shut off, but other than that, this is a very entertaining little game for all ages.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book answered a lot of questions. I have studied The New Testament within the confines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and could never could quite grasp the incongruity of the narrative presented to me there. This book efficiently provides all of the historical, linguistic, and cultural context needed to paint as complete a picture as one could expect from the information we have available to us.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a wonderful series, and I do pray that they are going to have another series.  Very nice, and well done!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is real. Honestly it has roots and leaves you in tears with emotion in your heart. I'm gonna read it again
B006MW3UZW|5.0|GREAT acting!  I did so want to let Thomas have it in the gut, but he did get it eventuallY!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The movies were great but it doesn't translate well into a game and you needed internet access to play this game which was not every accomadating.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I saw it at the theater when it first came out and used to have it on vhs, watching it many, many times. The storyline is great and the songs are so beautiful that I even bought the album.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love that derpy makes an appearance in the game. But I would love it even more if she were to be available on the shop at some point. And I know for a fact that I'm not alone in that thought. So will she ever be available In the shop anytime soon?
B00012QM8G|5.0|I would recommend that everyone watch this movie at least once.  It is a masterpiece... a true story about the holocaust and how one man gave so much of himself and all his available resources to save so many innocent men, women and children.
B009XY97VC|4.0|Two Steps From Hell (best known for making over the top music for movie trailers) has released this album of original compositions. Most are still in the &#34;brief but intense&#34; vein one would expect from this group. There are a few stumbling points though. There's one song with english lyrics, &#34;Back to the Earth,&#34; which just falls short of pretty much everything else on the album.<br /><br />Overall it's a bit like listening to a bunch of mini-soundtracks to movies that is only in your head. In an odd way though that's a minor drawback for me. While most tracks feel like complete thoughts in and of themselves, others feel like smaller parts of a whole that doesn't exist. That's really just my own headspace working against me though. If you like epic, you're going to love this.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|Baz does it again. I wonder what classic he has in store for us in the future. Wonderful performances by all.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I am not much for tv series. This one is one of those rare exceptions. It doesn't feel just like another soap opera in a different set like most. Good story line and they are not skimping on special effects. Check it out!
B0063M22QO|3.0|It is a very pleasant and entertaining to my whole family though I don't think it was worth 99 cents. It should have been free. No offense.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|This is the Best of the Best! When I will pay as much money as I did for all three of these DVD's....you know it is Terrific!...I saw the first Season on Tape....and I was going nuts  reasoning... there must be more!  I do not have cable or internet, except via a hot spot...so it was \\"necessary\\" for me to purchase immediately the other seasons!  Please writer....Hurry....Like the world has nothing better to do....but waste away in dream land....Thank you for a time period when things had more of a \\"proper\\" definition, and order...not necessarily better, but more of my family heritage. The British part any way.  Long live the Queen!  Fans Forever!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I liked it's a lot once u get going in the game u start being able to do a lot I like it
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this series! Can't get enough of it. Once you start watching it, its hard to stop. Excited to watch season 2.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I use my kindle fire and its works perfectly. I used this ever since like February and it was awesome. U could comment like favorite and check your channel and your inbox. Then the first update came and u couldn't comment on videos anymore. And it was still cool cuz all u had to do was switch to desktop and comment there. But then another update came and now u can't go full screen , u can't check your inbox and u still can't comment. Come one tubemate fix this
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book and I can't wait to read the second one because this book was super amazing and awesome. It made me want to write a book just like it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read...it appeals to the part of me that loves action, and it also demonstrates the angst that children experience in their relationships with parents, siblings, and other children.  No matter what our IQ, we often take what others say at 'face value.'<br /><br />I bought this book for both my grandsons ages 17 and 18.  It is a book that entertains and teaches young people and their elders as well (I am 75).<br /><br />I hope the other books in this series are as riviting as 'Ender's Game.'

0684803356|5.0|This is the first EH books I have read.  I love reading history and war related books because I want to get a sense of what it would be like to live in a desperate time under extreme conditions.  I found this book to be exciting with excellent characters and an excellent story.  I will probably read more of his works.  I recommend.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Happy to have the novel where it all started... I started with the Snowman & that was enough to hook me. Now I have read all the others...

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Very fun for the whole family, awesome gaming. Very cool game. It's fun to eat people and fish and watch your shark grow.  Highly recommended.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Definitely good. Will appeal to a variety of crossover readers from various genres. It is a fast read. I holed up over two evenings and read the whole thing. It didn't end exactly how I was predicting, so don't think you have figured it out. The writing is good. You can tell the author is skilled and practiced in his craft.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I like the product but for older less savy users of modern electronics it would be much easier if an operating manual was offered with purchase. Right now I am learning how to use it with the help of others (which I dont really like. Fred-age 69
0307476073|4.0|I would never have picked up this book if it wasn't chosen by my book club. Even then, I resisted. I am not into extreme exercise, or the drama of drug addiction, child abuse or tragic cancer deaths, and dislike wasting my time and energy enduring the emotional whirlwind and inane observations of people under 40. But I caved into the pressure and compromised by attempting to skip the details of her disturbing background and begin the book at page 30, when Cheryl begins her hike. What unfolded was a surprising and captivating portrait of a gentle, honest, humorous and intelligent woman watching herself bloom. I really came to like and admire Cheryl. I hadn't realized the author actually is over 40 (and it shows) and has become well educated and experienced enough to endow this silly-sounding story with mature insight and wisdom. It's an interesting feat - to accurately portray yourself at 26 when you're nearly 20 years older. But I believed everything about Cheryl and her struggle to become an independent woman. And I'm glad I accompanied her on this amazing trip!<br /><br />However, the jacket blurbs are ridiculously glowing. Ms. Strayed is a skillful writer and memoirist, and I look forward to reading her next book. But this isn't exactly \\"a literary triumph.\\" \\"Formidable\\"? \\"Awe-inspiring\\"? How about \\"a really fun, endearing, involving little book.\\" Enjoy being swept into Cheryl's world for a long weekend. I bet she'd be a great girlfriend! But don't expect it to change your life.<br /><br />By the way, some have criticized her ineptitude, sexuality or language, but it seemed entirely appropriate for that age. Maybe they've forgotten what it's like to be young, single and beautiful!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Mostly clean drama with historic significance. My honey and I just love it! We can't wait for next season. Not sure where they will go with it now!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Entertaining!! Hard to put down. Sylvia Day is very descriptive -- clearly paints the picture. Has the Shades of Grey feel. Fun read.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Love it when I was a kid and decided I wanted it. It is a great movie if you want a good laugh and a great message.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I've had this app as long as i had my kindle and it wont update. My friends get to put memes and videos and also have emoticons. Thus making this app terrible and unreliable. i mean just update it please!
B0063IH60K|2.0|I couldn't get it to load onto my android no matter how many times I tried.  I was disappointed that I couldn't load and play it because I'm a huge solitaire fan.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Great story that kept me reading till the end. One of the few stories I've read that I've had an interest in the supporting characters.  Enough so that I would buy the rest of the series. Felt that the ending was a bit rushed though.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My wee granddaughter who is 3 and a half years old simply loves this App. She can easily follow the activities and after showing her some of the added features she's off and running on her own. She spent half an hour telling mummy and daddy all about it. Fantastic
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|This is a quirky movie set in a residential home for musicians that sports a star cast. The characters are well portrait and while growing old is daunting, this story had light and heavy moments as the characters came to term with their fading fame. This movie focuses on the little and big things that people face as they live in community with others and shows examples what can happen in relationships.
8866135909|5.0|I love everything about this planner.  The pages are perfect and easy to write on.  I prefer this over my laptop any day.
1439156816|5.0|I've ready almost every work by Stephen King, sure there's some exceptions like Bag of Bones that I started and just couldn't get into and some of the e-book only type of releases, but for some reason hadn't had time to read this one, possibly because I hadn't made myself time due to the subject matter. I'm glad a friend finally gave me the book to read because I read it right away, knowing if I didn't I probably never would and boy am I happy. I find myself inspired to write and at the same time feel like I've learned a lot about the author who I've followed the closest throughout my life while doing so. Overall highly recommended to people that just enjoy reading Stephen King but also to those who do not but want some wonderful tips to improve their writing. Excellent!
B002BVQU5A|4.0|I though it was great acting. My wife didn't like it. It's a good show that helps you appreciate each person you meet.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I use three or four weather apps on my Samsung Galaxy S3 to obtain the best information on changing weather patterns and approaching storms. Accuweather Platinum is one of the best.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|One of the better books I read. Hosseini has a talent to create a masterpiece. You hate it when it is finished.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|This is one of the greatest releases of my lifetime.  Right up there with Colors from Between the Buried and Me.  The tracks are ordered perfectly, and I love the round turn they made on the song structure.  Oli sounds amazing and the lyrics are straight from his heart.  While I don't agree with his religious views, I am a lover of music, and this CD is some of the best music I have ever heard.  I hope they keep it up, because when I go back in my BMTH time machine, their sound has evolved and you can tell they have grown as musicians over the years.  Great job guys, this CD will be in my CD player for years to come!
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Love this movie.  No matter how many times I watch it, it is still good and a fun show to see.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book allows you to take a closer look at how you both give and receive love.  Recommended by my pastor, it was an enjoyable worthwhile read.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I like being able to start notes or lists while I am using my kindle.  It is very easy to navigate this note app.
B00632HWOG|5.0|A good e-mail app. My only complaint is that some of the attachments I cannot view with my kindle. But, that is more of an issue with the os compatability than the app.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Saves battery life. Works well with droid RAZR. Recommend this app. Tried other apps this seems to be the best one
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was an intriguing piece of literature ! A book that was difficult to put down, an uplifting and interesting story. I would recommend this story \\" The Secret Garden\\" to everyone ! A classic for all to read ! Interesting the \\"magic\\" and \\"God\\" , loved it !
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Once you figure out what they want .it's easy. But it will keep you occupied for awhile. Don't pay 2 much though. It's fun but not that fun...

098478280X|5.0|I think that the questions covered in this book cover the scope of software interviews pretty well. It's good that the practice questions at the end of each chapter address different and varied aspects of the subject material of the chapter.<br /><br />Solutions are sketched in a quite neat and practical way, too. Alternate solutions are also discussed and compared, which is pretty important in the context of interviews.<br /><br />There is also a short section that introduces the reader briefly to the cultures of major tech-companies and how to handle the pre/post interview process.<br /><br />The author also maintains the site, careercup.com which contains lots of interview questions submitted by users.<br /><br />Having also read a few other books, I think this looks like the ultimate software interview preparation book for the time being. However, it can also be good to skim through it time to time to refresh concepts, apart from interview preparation.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Perfect for school. I'm a heavy sleeper too! It wakes me up with b.o.b. Ray bands! Definitely worth the purchase.
0061353248|4.0|This book is a great read on how easily and unconsciously we all make irrational decisions all the time. The author mentions a lot of interesting research results. He also draws from his own experiences, like how he tried to cope with his severe burn accident treatment and how it could have even been done better.<br /><br />The book approaches our every day behaviour from such a refreshing and intriguing angle that the reader feels naturally to self-reflect and bring some of the insight to her own life.<br /><br />For further reading, I strongly recommend Thinking Fast & Slow, which is also quite easy to read and mind-opening.<br /><br />Note: The author has also another book called &#34;The Upside of Irrationality&#34;. Having read both books, I suggest reading either of them (favourably this one), since the gist of the books are pretty much similar to me.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Best trilogy since the original Star Wars trilogy! Great story line, lots of action, visually stunning, all done with cutting edge film making at the time. I think it's a modern day sci-fi classic!
B009RX85N0|5.0|I love this TV show and this is an amazing second season love the extras on this DVD also cannot wait until season three!!!!
B00DU74U74|4.0|It's an outside the box kind of movie but if you like the movies that make you think about things that will never happen, it's for you. My &#34;literal&#34; friends didn't like it so much but I did!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I've been hearing about this show for ages, it doesn't disappoint! The storytelling is fantastic and the characters are easy to connect with.

B00EI6E17A|5.0|At first I was a bit set back but after you listen to it a few more times and than watch the video it just gets better and better with each listen. The bridge is catchy for sure and the lyrics are kinda simple but the its got beat! One I think needs to take in account is to stop comparing it to her other work from years past now and take it as its worth. And stop ripping it apart piece by piece. Does it make you dance and move? Yes. Does it have a good beat? Yes. Does the chorus make you sing along? Yes. And do you want to hear it again? Yes. Than simply just enjoy it. In either case welcome back GaGa and look forward to the rest of the album come November.

B001AR0D4A|2.0|The movie is good. I won't reveal any details to spoil it for you. It is Sci Fi / Horror, typical of Stephen King. This movie was developed from a short story that was in the book: \\"Skeleton Crew.\\" The Blue Ray Disc does not boot up right on my BD/DVD player and certain functions don't work correctly. I am just glad it agrees to play. I won't spend the time and effort to return it though, since it will play. The quality of the the HD is not great either. I have seen standard def that has much more definition than this movie. Unfortunately, Blue Ray Discs are just like boxes of chocolates. You never know what you are going to get.
B00CVFTDKU|5.0|Broadchurch is a coastal town in Dorset.  On the beach, beneath a cliff, the body of an 11 year-old boy is found.  He has not fallen to his death, but been strangled.  A local psychic (?) suggests that his body has been brought to the shore in a boat.<br /><br />A local detective sergeant (Ellie Miller, played by Olivia Colman) has expected to be promoted and put in charge of the case.  However, she is preempted by detective inspector Alec Hardy (played by David Tennant) who has been brought in from the outside.  Hardy was in charge of a celebrated, failed case in the past and he has a severe heart condition, which he has concealed from his superiors.  Together they will investigate the death of the 11 year-old, a friend of Ellie's son, Tom.  Their relationship will be both strained and respectful.<br /><br />The investigation is explored in eight segments (ca. 45-50 minutes each).  By the conclusion, nearly every resident of Broadchurch will become a suspect and a host of subsidiary, sometimes unrelated secrets will be revealed.<br /><br />This series was immensely popular in the UK and was recommended to us as a `don't miss' by English friends.  It certainly lived up to expectations.  By the final segments we were staying up into the small hours as the series reached its conclusion.  In some ways this is an ensemble cast show; the parents of the dead child probably have as many lines as the detectives.  The performances are all strong, the setting is utilized very effectively and the mystery is compelling.<br /><br />The writing is not quite of `Endeavour' or `Foyle's War' quality.  It is not as memorable or as profoundly moving as those shows can be.  On the other hand, the plot is strong and your attention never flags.<br /><br />The `feel' of the show is interesting.  It is not quite Twin Peaksish, but there are several interesting, otherworldly characters and throughout we have the sense that we have entered an enclosed society that has guarded its secrets very carefully.  That, of course, is the standard ethos of the English mystery, but here there is an added dimension, largely provided by the setting and the direction.  The sea is vast, the waves loud, the cliff menacingly high, the town itself relatively deserted (certainly by Dorset standards), the caravans (=trailers) frightening and ominous.<br /><br />This is strong material.  Would that we could produce such programming as regularly and consistently as the Brits do.<br /><br />Highly recommended.y carefully.

B00BMTX5IW|5.0|This is great music and what an earthy young woman with a great flair for rhythm & jazz love all the tracks
B0098G7AWS|5.0|A classic with many parts to it - the first half is more fun to watch than the second half, with all of the panic trying to flee the ship - but it IS gripping!  Even the flashbacks are worth watching and add much to the film - highly recommend.

147674355X|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Colleen Hoover and I cannot recommend her enough as an author you must have on your pile to read.  If there's one new adult book you read this year... UGH, there are so many I LOVE but ... you've got to read Hopeless.  Ms. Hoover left me dizzy, fuzzy, warm, and so in love with love when I turned the very last page and closed the book.  *sniff, sniff*<br /><br />Would you believe I really had no desire to read this book based on the title?  \\"Hopeless\\"?  Ugh... sounds like such a sad tale of kids whining about how horrible their lives are.  THIS WAS SO NOT THAT BOOK!!!  Let me tell you what made me write *head explodes* on my Goodreads review right when I finished.  Finished in record time (for me, mind you) - read 406 pages in one day!!!  I could not stop!<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />I was so taken in by Sky.  I loved her character and wit.  She was so easy going, accepting of situations, and she made the best of her quirky mom's lifestyle (no tv, no cell phones, no technology!) like it was no big deal.  Yeah, she knew it was a pain in the butt but that was her life.  And the way she handled the \\"bullies\\" at school - absolutely priceless!!!  This was a girl I fell so completely for (stop!  not that way, you dork!!).<br /><br />And to give her a warrior like Holden... *sigh*.<br /><br />Dang, am I even reviewing this book or writing it a love letter?<br /><br />Story / Tempo<br /><br />There is so much to this story, so many plot twists and turns, so many wrinkles.  First, there's the whole meeting the main characters, establishing the plot of getting these two kids together, having them interact with the supporting characters (who are totally awesome, by the way!).  Then we pull the rug right out from under them and scramble the whole entire thing up - Woosh!  It's a story of what love is and what it can endure.<br /><br />I will warn you, there are some intense scenes so I would definitely advise the parents to read through this one before handing it off to anyone below the age of 17.  Yes, the characters are in high school but there's some mature subject matter here.<br /><br />What I loved most?  The simplicity of caring and knowing that perfect is NOT perfect and accepting that.  Yeah, it was that good.  It's making me all greeting card prolific.  I'm such a sucker for this stuff.his one before handing it off to anyone below the age of 17.

B0063IH60K|4.0|What can I really say about a portable, electronic version of an old card game favorite- It is something to past the time if you don't have wifi and you don't have a long time ( heck I play at least 2 games during my 10 minute breaks at work )!
B004CS7R70|1.0|I worked and worked and worked to try and get it to focus on my TV but was never successful. At standard viewing distance you can only see part of the screen and even that is not comfortable viewing. What a waste of money! You would think a German product would have better engineering than this. I hardly return anything but I'm going to try and get my money back on this one.<br /><br />Rick<br /><br />Edit 9/1/13: The product did not work for me but I am PLEASED with the seller. The refund process was simple and I received my refund promptly.<br /><br />Rick

0345803450|2.0|Had I read this, I'd have stopped mid-way, bored with the repetition and whining, gone to the end to see the revelations promised in the early pages.  However, as I listened to Juliet Stevenson's truly excellent narration instead, I stuck with the book.  Got to the end and realized how badly I'd been played, been had by the author.<br /><br />I am of the same era as Serena and initially thought McEwan had gotten his hands on my late-teens-into-twenties diaries.  Except that I did not keep any.  But the thoughts and the thinking from then were embarrassingly familiar and pulled me in for the first half - like coming across an old photo, being glad no one else can see the dorkiness therein.  I could even imagine Rita Tushingham [\\"Girl with the Green Eyes\\"] or Lynn Redgrave [\\"Georgy Girl\\"] playing Serena - \\"Sweet Tooth\\" is so redolent of that era, of the experience of mixing late girlhood, being in college, meeting a fading professor, first job, et al. But it goes on and on, like an old LP stuck in a groove.<br /><br />Serena's intense dislike of Tom's \\"ape\\" story, his tricking the reader, his dishonesty caught me.  She was quite right in her dismay.  And, at the end, with a sly wink, McEwan does the exact same thing to the reader.  What a scam!<br /><br />The only thing I was left wondering about was - as Serena certainly does have the gift for devoting herself to knaves - did she see how dastardly her lover was or did she go blindly to him, sobbing out her love, her gratitude to him for his hateful confession.  But by then I didn't much care.

B007SYWFRM|2.0|This is a fun game but has many problems. Freezes constantly, lost items, crashes non stop, special events disappear & game crashes when trying to visit other villages. I have notified gameloft often but receive the same rhedoric . They blame my kindle, etc but never have a problem with anything else.<br />The game also disappeared twice & had to start anew

B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Pretty straight forward. Doesn't do anything spectacular or poorly. Got this app for my mom, she played the windows version on her laptop before it died. She had a few issues with selecting exactly what she wanted, even when using a stylus, and it kept prompting her to buy stuff which she didn't care for.

B00C061HZY|5.0|Here we are, August 20 2013.  Just over 4 months to go in 2013.  I'll be amazed if another album comes along that displaces Random Access Memories as my favorite album of 2013.  This was my first introduction to Daft Punk. I have since purchased Discovery and Alive 2007. Both are awesome.  If you have a turntable, go for Random Access Memories on Vinyl; the production quality is top notch and the vinyl sounds perfect.  Vinyl comes with free .mp3's with the AutoRip feature.

I get to squeal with delight every time I can hand this to an older child or teenager, because I know that I'm sending a new person into Garth Nix's fabulously crafted world. It's dark, funny, exciting, disgusting, lush... and there's more! Read on to meet Lirael (necromancing library worker with a magical dog, hello?!) and Abhorsen (oh the romance)... Top notch!

B005K17RU0|3.0|This app seems to have more bugs than a New York hotel bed. It takes at least 2 tries to launch and it crashes almost every time. The concept of an upgrade is good only if the result really goes in the desired direction. This app was better before it was &quot;improved.&quot;
B004J4WKTW|1.0|This book had the potential to be interesting but I had to slog through the last 100 pages just so I could find out what happens and be done with it. The whole thing reads like fan fiction. The writing is heavy-handed and never lets the reader become absorbed--each line tries to be more dramatic than the last. The characters are poorly drawn and not developed at all. A truly unfulfilling book.

1401201911|5.0|I purchased this book for my husband as a gift so I can't really comment on the quality of it. It arrived very quickly and was as pictured. I'm sure he will love it.
B000BW7QWW|1.0|I loved the show.  But the movie was just a recipe action movie that pretty much destroyed the great characterizations and the feel of the series.  A hack job by the big movie companies just wanting to make money of off a pretty damned good series.<br /><br />Rip-off by the big boys!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My whole family loves playing this game.  It's like an upgraded subway surfer. I really like that you can go between the three lairs so you aren't just running the same path all the time
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The music was terrific.<br />Cast was great.<br />I will try other opera films.<br />Very enjoyable and we laughed a lot.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|While Peter Sellers shines throughout the film, my favorite scene remains Slim Pickens riding the bomb down!<br />A wonderful cast deliver solid tongue in cheek silliness.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Leave it to a Muslim to strip away the myth and fantasy that define Christianity and paint a picture of Jesus of Nazareth set squarely in the reality he experienced. Reza Aslan, Iranian refugee in America, fundamentalist Christian turned Muslim, brilliant scholar of comparative religion, gives us Jesus as he really was -- an illiterate first-century Jewish woodworker and day laborer consumed by revolutionary zeal to overthrow the tyranny of the Roman Empire and the parasitic priestly caste that held away over Judea from the Temple in Jerusalem.<br /><br />History matters<br /><br />In placing the life of Jesus in context, Aslan emphasizes the significance of the first, failed Jewish revolt against Rome that climaxed in the year 73 C.E. with the mass suicide of 960 Jewish fighters holed up in the desert fortress of Masada. That revolt drew the attention of the Emperor in Rome like nothing before it in Judea had ever done. The Emperor's embarrassment led to the dispatch of legions of Roman soldiers to the region, the utter destruction of Jerusalem, and the massacre of most of the Jewish population of all Judea.<br /><br />Prior to 73 C.E., a bitter debate had raged within the Christian Diaspora between James, one of Jesus' brothers and the titular head of the movement, and Paul (formerly Saul). James and his allies among the Apostles held that the belief system growing up around the teachings of Jesus were not a separate religion but simply a new form of Jewish belief and practice, that it was open only to fellow Jews, that those who followed Jesus had to adhere to the Mosaic Law in all its particulars, and that Jesus had been the messiah in the sense all Jews fully recognized: the man who would usher in the liberation of the Jewish people from Rome and the cleansing of the Temple.<br /><br />Jesus recast<br /><br />Paul, though himself also a Jew, insisted on opening up the faith to gentiles (non-Jews), asserted that Jesus' Jewishness was immaterial, rejected the importance of the Mosaic Law (even going so far as to prohibit circumcision), and laid the groundwork for the deification of Jesus as the Son of God by those who wrote the later gospels of the New Testament. Aslan points out that the phrase \\"Son of God\\" had never before been meant to be taken literally; it was one of many titles assigned to Jewish kings and Roman emperors for centuries. Jesus referred to himself as the Son of Man.<br /><br />It was historical circumstance, Aslan implies, that won the victory in this debate for Paul. Following their devastating defeat by the Romans, the surviving Jews would hear nothing of revolution for years to come. Jesus the gentle shepherd was a much more palatable figure for the times, and as Paul and his followers spread their message ever more widely around the periphery of the Mediterranean, the identification of Jesus with his Jewish heritage and beliefs became increasingly inconvenient. Once the Christian religion became firmly ensconced in Rome and was, first, resisted, then tolerated, and finally adopted as the official faith of the Empire, it took on more and more of the trappings and the core beliefs of the vast numbers of new converts.<br /><br />Aslan calls this \\"the long process of transforming Jesus from a revolutionary Jewish nationalist into a peaceful spiritual leader with no interest in any earthly matter. That was a Jesus the Romans could accept . . .\\"<br /><br />For Jesus and his contemporaries to think of himself as, literally, the Son of God would have been absurd. For the Romans and Greeks of the second and third centuries C.E. to cast him in that light was perfectly natural.<br /><br />Why some Christians hate Jews<br /><br />All the while the faith of Jesus was being transformed and his life rewritten, the story of Jesus' arrest and crucifixion was also turned upside down in the later retellings of the story. The historical Jesus was arrested by Roman soldiers and crucified for sedition within days withouta trial of any sort, much less a dramatic encounter with the notoriously cruel and disdainful Roman governor, Pontius Pilate. Aslan suggests that, in the extremely unlikely event Jesus was called before the governor, he would have been asked a single question (\\"Are you the King of the Jews?\\") and then been sent off to die. In reshaping the tale, the writers of the New Testament transformed Pilate into a meek, compassionate ruler who'd concluded Jesus was innocent of the charge of sedition, and placed all the blame on the high priest, his hierarchy in the Sanhedrin, and the Jewish people of Jerusalem. It is from these writings -- all of which were intended to curry favor with the Romans -- that the scurrilous charge that \\"The Jews killed Jesus\\" arose.<br /><br />One of the sources of this long-lasting libel is the widespread belief among so many Christians that everything written in the Bible is literally true. Aslan contends, however, that \\"the gospels are not, nor were they ever meant to be, a historical documentation of Jesus' life. These are not eyewitness accounts of Jesus's words and deed recorded by people who knew him. They are testimonies of faith composed by communities of faith and written many years after the events they describe. Simply put, the gospels tell us about Jesus the Christ, not Jesus the man.\\" And their authors, who were almost certainly different from the men whose names are attached to them, were entirely conscious that what they were writing were messages of faith, not factual accounts. Only in recent centuries has it become customary to draw a sharp line between myth and reality.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It was most enjoyable to get the whole season at once . It was a great PBS show, hopefully you will have more like this.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Following in the genre of The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, And the Mountains Echoed is a story beginning in Afghanistan and traveling to France and America and back.  It's the touchingly real story of love and loss and death. Hosseini is a masterful storyteller and not to be missed.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is so addictive! I completely forget the time when playing! If your careful with what you do you can play for hours without needing to spend money on more energy! It's great!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|a much better way to wake up the that squaking alarm clock!  You can pick what sound you want to wake up to and it's soothing.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This CD has so many great new songs. It has songs with great rhythm that one could dance to. It has love songs and beautifully sad songs, and of course, songs in different languages (I absolutly love when Josh sings in other languages). There is a wonderful duet with great harmonies &#34;E Ti Promettero&#34;. My very favorite piece in this collection is &#34;Sincera&#34;. Because it's in a language I do not know, I can listen to Josh's voice as purely an instrument, and what a glorious instrument it is. In &#34;Sincera&#34;, his voice and the music take an uplifting journey, and if you listen to it at a healthy volume, it may elevate you to heaven for just a couple of minutes.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|so far I really like the game.  Only played a few times against the machine and enjoyed it a lot.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This show is so addictive! I was sick, so I bought Seasons 1 & 2 to watch while I rested.<br />Amazon let me watch it on Prime on my computer before I even got the DVDs. I bought the Original UK version after I had read others say that they felt jipped by buying the US version and it had some scenes cut from the UK version.<br />The show keeps you guessing and the characters pull you into their lives. I bought Season 3 and watched that too. I think I watched all three Seasons in 10 days!<br />I cannot wait until January 2014 when Seaon 4 comes out!!
B006WJ0332|5.0|I really enjoyed the beginning of the show.  It is great to see how the show started and the diversity in the cast.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever read. It keeps you in the moment and you can't keep yourself distant. You're right there and there's no escape.
B0029ZA49Q|1.0|Not much to say here.  I used it on a Toploader 70. It flopped around all over the place, despite being tightened within an inch of its life.  There are ways to make a secure four-point harness, but this is not it.
B006MGB31Q|5.0|It had everything I hoped for. Great resolution.  Had extended versions of the movies that were a lot of fun to watch.
B00004D35R|1.0|we couldn't get this dvd to play on our unit. i thought it might be a problem with our player, although i have no problem playing my other dvds. i loaned it to a friend and he can't get it to work either! defective!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|The Cd arrived just fine. I love her music, so I knew I would love this Cd. And I do.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|so lame I hate this kindle wish I had gone with anything else. this app is lame on my phone need the screen space to play comfortably.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A zombie series based on a graphic novel could have turned out to be pretty bad and cheesy.  However Walking Dead is anything but.<br />The acting, script and production values are all first rate.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Show is great.  Didn't have time to watch on tv plus I wanted to own it, so I got it on Amazon instant video.  And it looks great on it.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|One of the cutest movies you will probably ever see in your life, and I'm not lying either. It's a hilarious Disney movie about a supervillan who adopts three innocent and hilarious little girls. How could anyone seriously not like this movie?
B008602KQI|5.0|Bought this on pre-order. Received the dvd plus was able to watch on instant video at midnight.  Love instant video.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Game of Thrones is a superb example of this genre (fantasy, sword & sorcery). Intriguing storyline, engaging characters, lavish scenery and sets, juicy drama and well paced directing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing bingo blitz & when I downloaded this game I never knew how much I would be addicted to it. Lol. Don't hesitate get it & see for yourself how much fun it is.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Only thing I didn't like was the ending.  Waiting for more.<br /><br />To be continued I hope...
B001NLL93W|5.0|I found out about Mortal instruments from a movie trailer....I am completely hooked!!!  Love this series!!  I already pre-ordered the next book to be released in 2014!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is totally how I felt in high school but the ending really shocked me. That never happened to me. I wish it had been different.
B000FC1AGG|3.0|I thought it was better towards the end. I had some difficulty relating to the main character, but she grew on me. The story has a great climax point and a good ending. I would recommend this to Chic Lit book lovers.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I hate this thing right now! Everytime i try to get on it , it says vtube has stop . Like what the hell .
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game it's fun if you don't have any pets and you can get hundreds of animals you might never see
0345803507|5.0|I can't put the book down; I love it. The story line keeps the reader mesmerized and I like the graphic details
B008OOYALE|5.0|It is a great game with awesome dragons. I really enjoy the update with SO many new dragons and dragon types.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|The book had me wanting more , it had me smiling here and there . But I expected more from the ending.
1932100660|5.0|There is information that everyone should know.  For example the amount of meat that you eat can turn on or turn off some  forms of cancer.  Each of the conclusions are based on very large groups, so the conclusions should be believed.  I borrowed a copy from the library, but then decided I want my own copy so I can underline the important information.<br /><br />Bob
B009178OQA|5.0|This movie provides an inside look at the greates sushi chef of our day. It's really about the pursuit of excellence. I thought it was great and inspirational. However, I thought it would have been interesting to hear from Jiro's wife. I wonder what her life has been like since Jiro is essentially never home and she doesn't work at the restaurant. Anyway - great film about a quirky guy / topic.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This wraps up the series nicely. Plot twists continue to keep the reader turning pages. I highly suggest reading this novel.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|Another great story by Hayao Miyazaki and his team at Ghibli Studio, beautiful art and a message to all the people who see this
B00DLZ2XQK|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because I am a huge Britney fan and everything she releases I just love. This song is very cheesy and it's mainly targeted at children... so, since it's a childish song (just take a look at the video) I don't think many people will like it. Anyways, the song is funky and really cool. It has a cool vibe.<br /><br />The single includes a song called &#34;Vacation&#34; by G.R.L. I don't care about it. I just listened to it once. I just care about Britney.<br /><br />This is definitely a product for huge Britney fans or collectors, but not for everybody. Trust me.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fast and fun paced without losing your interest. Keeps your mind stimulated by having to think several moves ahead. Great fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I looooooooooooooooovvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeee minecraft i play it every day it is amazing and did i mention it is THE BEST GAME EVER!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Do not waste your money on this book.  It's the worst thing I I've ever read in my life, turrible doesn't do it justice.
B00846REIS|1.0|Seriously boring after the 1st chapter!  Beautiful woman, beautiful rich man,.one big boring sex fairy tale! Waste of time, it was one of our book club picks or I would have quit half way thru!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked 100 floors, but this is much better. Some creative thinking goes into each level.<br />Make sure to search EVERYTHING in the room. One item missed might be the item needed to complete the level. Terrific game.
B000S1L7IU|4.0|It's a great read for traveling when you don't really want to put a lot of thought into what you're reading...great story, love the fact they're getting into Tesla's work, but still formulaic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its a really fun game to play ~and it is very adicting!!!**! you have to try it trust me you will love it&lt;3
B00DIFARQ6|3.0|I downloaded it just to check it out, it's ok, wouldn't 'pay' for it.  The 'large' aircraft seems much more sensitive than the other aircraft (on my kindle).
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I like Bruno Mars.  This CD is great for listening, less so for dancing.  So, it is in the car where I can't dance..
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This is a fun game and I agree with the other reviews that this game is becoming increasingly geared towards having to buy credits. With the new version from buffalo, you may not get the credits you purchased and the support is nonexistent.
B009LXEBD4|3.0|I buy CDs these days for dance tunes.  Kelly has some great tunes, but a lot of her sounds are similar after a while.  Some great night club two-steps on this album.
B00A822VDY|5.0|Great movie, probably my favorite Disney/Pixar. Blu ray version looks terrific and it's nice having the DVD version as well.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|This was presented well. It worked!!!! It is a good movie and Craig is Bond. I would buy another of this quality.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This is a must have for any listener of country music. It is a terrific buy in the $10-$12 range.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I have a Sony handycam that is very small and hard to handle in certain applications, this handle is just the ticket I needed to stabilize my shots and the price right, too. This handle is so easy to use plus I can add a light on the shoe or my digital recorder and you can set it down anywhere with the rubber rails on the bottom plus the foam padding is very comfortable when gripping the handle. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a steadier video shot.
B0002YLC24|1.0|Bought this movie as a gift for my wife. It's supposed to be romantic and even she didn't like it. I wouldn't recommend.
B006H5120E|5.0|After recently purchasing a 3D Blu-ray player, I knew I had to pick this up as one of the first movies I watch. Keep in mind I didn't see it in theaters for the 3D release, but I was just so blown away at how incredible it looked on screen. It has of course been remastered in HD so the quality is incredible, and the stunning 3D just topped it off. On top of the movie itself, the bonus features are incredible, I was fairly certain the content wouldn't be features I hadn't seen, but they most definitely were. Plenty of never before scenes that, in my opinion, changed the story quite a bit so it was really interesting to see how Jim Cameron cut them out. You don't even need to be a die hard Titanic fan to appreciate the incredible quality, and features that are included. I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone who is looking for a stunning 3D movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show!  Witty banter, like able characters, fast moving plot, great story ideas, what's not to like?!  Lois starts out annoying the heck out of you but you start to care for him and his crazy ways.  One of the best shows on television!
B001O1O71C|5.0|It's good and also its sad. I like this book because it has many words.so have fun.be sure to make more books.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|I. loved this story. IT surprised me for how good it was. I would recommend this to my friends. Please give it a chance.
B00785P2QC|2.0|I definitely liked the concept of this game but there were so many shortfalls when it came to the design I very quickly deleted the game from my Kindle.  The first issue is that the layout and buttons in game play are not intuitive and there was really no &#34;tutorial&#34; upon first play to walk the player through it.  That I could get the hang of just through trial and error.  The bigger issues for me were there was no descriptive explanation of what I get if I &#34;upgrade&#34; certain items and when I would want to &#34;buy&#34; something the cost would not display.  If I didn't have enough game money I would just get a message that I didn't have enough and did I want to buy more.  How can I strategically play the game if I dont know what things cost or how I will benefit from upgrades.  The game just needs to be further developed and I think it could be entertaining.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love it!  The storyline is fast paced, and the characters are well developed.  Great plot twists.  Harvey (Gabriel Macht) is a BABE!!!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|OK SOOO<br />.. The first time I downloaded this it worked PERFECTTT<br />After like 5-6 times using it, it always says \\"youtube has stopped\\"<br /><br />please fix!!!!

B008JFUN50|3.0|In Elysium, vast discrepancies of wealth have separated off the very rich to Elysium, a vast orbiting station,to enjoy a blissful, free-from-care world; on earth the vast majority are consigned to overpopulated cites full of disease and decay.Jodie Foster is defence minister in the government on Elysium. She is responsible for the shooting down of airships not cleared to come into Elysium airspace. Down on earth Matt Damon plays Max the tough ex-convict scratching a living in a factory, and as an ex -criminal is required to report to a robot parole officer. Neil Blomkamp the director made a previous sci-fi film on a small budget(District 9)which made a massive impact. The risk is that the follow up will with a bigger budget get smaller audiences. Was he only able to get funding for a sci-fi movie when he wanted to make a different movie? This film's heart is in the right place: the way we treat healthcare, immigrants. Healthcare should it seems to say be free at the point of use. This is sci-fi of a kind of wish fulfilment of present needs,not an attempt to predict what will occur in the future. Blomkamp is really interested in the present. What's going on with healthcare, what's going on with gated communities? Was this the right way to deal with these issues? For Blomkamp it seems so. With science fiction, we are able to divorce ourselves from the modern context and see what we really think about the underlying issues.<br /><br />Lots of the sci-fi comes to us second hand, we've seen a lot of this before(Johnny Nmemonic, Robocop).Their one desire, Max and his childhood sweetheart and her ailing daughter, is to get to Elysium, and it's not that interesting once they get there what they do with it. With sci-fi you want cleverness in the use of technology, the main plot point here is they go after someone without knowing who it is (an Elysium bigwig )to get a crucial piece of data. The big thing in this movie is his main villain Sharlto Copley is a South African, andhe's as nasty as they come. Matt Damon gives a very solid, physical performance(and is the major draw).Jodie Foster starts off promisingly but is given nothing to do. Spider(Maura) is like the creative midfield player in football, essential for effecting transitions, plot points in a suitably colourful manner. Of course Blomkamp is very good on shoot'em ups and gadgetry like the exosleton Max wears to give his shortened life more strength, but this is not what the best sci-fi is about(Stalker, Solaris),where we are tipped into deep thought with few specialeffects. He is good at grainy, downtrodden worlds. Los Angeles is like Mexico City and the vast majority seem to speak Spanish. A third world polluted planet. But what lets it down? As a story the action dominated character and plot to the detriment of the film, which poorly scripted gives no exploration of the earth environment or that of Elysium and breaks out into formulaic robotics, extinguishing the satiric spark.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great way to unwind! They need to work on the memory issues. Other than that I love it. I really love winning on the slots. Feels like Vegas!
B00BV1P8NG|4.0|I ordered the normal derpy vinyl but got the shiny/glittery one. It didn't bother me enough to send it back but I could see it being a problem.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love  the series  and was  afraid of being bored by a book where  I already knew what was  going to happen.  Despite that I love  every minute of this well written page turner.  On to the next one!
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I find myself thinking about and referring to this book after reading it.  The story unfolds in its own way, beginning with an intriguing<br />but opaque young protagonist who finds herself in jail after an unusual spontaneous act (for her).  We gradually learn her story and<br />I found it so touching and beautifully rendered that it evoked many layers of emotion.<br />Her descriptions of early childhood with her unusual sister are best with her first sensual memories and leading up to loss and betrayal.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|A fun twist and some new things to destroy but it lacks a little something.  When I have a choice I will always go original but this is quite fun as well you wont go wrong.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|The book keeps you guessing throughout and delivers a surprise ending.  The cast of characters reads like an Elmore book but with current themes and believable happenings.  Michael Connelly never fails to entertain while being concerned with right and wrong.
B000002VSN|5.0|From the Movie soundtrack and produced by Clive DAVIS who discovered Whitney Houston in her teens.<br />&#34;The Preachers Wife&#34; features Whitney at her best released in1996 I loved the soundtrack.<br />A great companion to the film.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|My family and I enjoyed watching this movie a few times before the time ended.  We are definitely looking forward to a sequel/sequels.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|California their latest album again delivers great songs &#34;Drive By' and &#34;50 Ways To Say Good bye&#34;<br />As a fan from their debut album &#34;Train&#34; they have always been very consistent and never disappoint.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I cannot speak for others in my family, but I was unable to grasp the objective of this movie.  I am a fan of both Halle Berry and Tom Hanks but this movie was not for me.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Rating is because this products rocks.  Primarily using this for storm chasing and this has several advantages of is predecessor the BU-353. Cold, Warm starts connects a lot faster then the older version, its very versatile products, can us on the dash or on top of the car as it as a strong magnet hasn't fallen off yet in 70mph wind or traveling at high speeds. Its not an eyesore or theft target bright yellow like some other products. Very tiny about the size of a Silver Dollar, but no so small you'll easily lose it. Has a tiny red light to confirm its connecting to the satellites, but the light is perfect brightness for me, just enough to tell its connected, not like other products that glow bright blue when driving at night and reflect that light off the glass...cough ms.<br />Make sure you get the latest drives off of the website, and when navigating the website make sure you get the proper drivers as this device can be used on many products (ie linux, apple, microsoft, and older handheld devices) drivers should be like the 4th or 5th down from the list.<br />Works on any GPS software I have used on it (ie S&T2013, DeLorme Street Atlas, Gibson Ridge GRLevel3 v2 (GPS feature), If you plan to use any of these softwares or others simultaneously I'd highly recommend using a program called Franson GPS Gate.<br />I would recommend this GPS receiver to anyone for storm chasing, travel or general use as it is very accurate in showing your position and is very flexible with any software and is fast to connect. :)
B008RA3MGO|4.0|For someone made famous by her repetitive and integrating song \\"Call Me Maybe\\" I was surprised by how much I love this album. This isn't a play every day, I can't live without it, but this album is solid and cohesive. There are stumbling blocks such as the electronic driven \\"Tonight I'm Getting Over You\\", which not only doesn't sound like her style, but is borderline irritating. It's preceded by a syrupy sweet exchange of love with Justin Beiber called \\"Beautiful\\". I can't really stomach this song it's so sweet it makes my teeth hurt. There are notable songs that really solidify the album like \\"Curiosity\\" and \\"Tiny Little Bows\\", but for the most part Carly Rae makes sure to stay within safe pop standards. By doing that she makes sure none of the material is sickening, it's all safe reliable pop. And, if you accept it for what it is, you'll find this album to be a comfortable and above average start for a girl who doesn't have the strongest voice or the best looks, but manages to make it all work into a cohesive package that isn't just eleven reproductions of \\"Call Me Maybe\\".<br /><br />I would recommend buying the deluxe edition as it contains the obnoxiously entertaining \\"I Know You Have a Girlfriend\\" and almost perfect \\"Drive\\" where's she so vain as to say 'I don't care about my lipstick' as if she was born with lipstick on.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|This might be a old school horror! But its a kick ass horror movie! This movie freakin rocks! Everything about this movie is killer! Everyone should own this movie!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Enjoyed reading, had closure, different from the 1st and 2nd books (not necessarily in a good or bad way, depend on your tastes)
B00742BVW8|2.0|The movie may have been okay to me if it wasn't a subtitled movie. I thought it was in english. If I wanted to read a movie, I would have bought a silent movie. It would be appreciated if the movies are of english subtitle that it is made known before it is purchased.
0452289963|5.0|I borrowed this book to read.  Before completing it, I realized I had to have a copy of my own.  I have read it through and am eager to read it again.  It needs to be absorbed and then reread and reread--a must for all who are searching to improve themselves.
B005K2Z5IA|5.0|I highly recommend this cover. it is very protective and doesn't add too much bulk to the kindle. If you are worried about your kindle falling out of a hard cover, this is a great alternative that will keep your device safe.
0385349947|1.0|Trite, repetitive, almost as if written by a software program.<br /><br />In light of recent revelations that cheap-skate Sandberg avoided paying a dime to some over-worked intern(s), the buying public would do well in boycotting this failed writing attempt offered up by this pedantic future politician (no doubt).<br /><br />The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.<br /><br />So it goes!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|You have given the &#34;quiet people&#34; a voice and a reason to feel good about their gifts! For so long I have been told I was &#34;reserved&#34; (by my mother) and an &#34;introvert&#34; by my crazy extrovert husband...Like it was bad, a problem and something to be rid of. But, from reading your book, I see so much of my nature in a positive way...so thank you from the girl who stood in the back and waited to talk until she was ready.

Doesn't look like that much fun. If it wont download properly, I am sure it would not have played properly if it had finished. Next game, please! Amazon claims this game is compatible with my Tablet.

B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|1. This is based on a comic so it encompasses a classic comic plot of good vs. evil with a great approach taken on the side of the hero<br />2. CGI graphics are low quality but it doesn't take away from the characters or story<br />3. Having become a cult classic, this is Brandon Lee's most memorable performance much like the Joker has become Heath Ledger's most memorable performance after either actor's untimely passing<br />4. The soundtrack is awesome and definitely sets the tone for the whole movie<br />5. The DVD extras (commentary, behind the scenes...) is a great bonus<br />6. What made this movie even more heart wrenching for me was the similarity in Brandon Lee's charater and his life. The main characters in the movie are engaged SPOILER ALERT until they are both killed, Brandon was also engaged and worked closely on the set of the Crow with his fiance. This movie was a heart felt dedication to the couple.<br /><br />I strongly advise watching this movie and the 'behind the scenes'

0375704027|5.0|This is a deeply moving story of how we grow up and the people we meet in our youth eventually fade away for any circumstance whatsoever. Murakami did a great job of narrating the view of the world around the eyes of the main protagonists. I couldn't stop imagining the settings and the food and the music and everything the main character experiences. Highly Recommended.
0547258305|5.0|I discoverd Graceling in the library and took it home to read it all at once. I couldn't put it down. Its about Katsa finding her true potential on an amazing adventure in a world full of talent and mystery. The young romance is beautiful and really makes you fall in love with the characters.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I was going to give this item four stars, but the more I thought about it the more I realized that it does exactly what it is supposed to. I bought it to take with me into the woods as a way to clean up my blade without sacrificing weight or space. Is it the cutlery industry's standard for sharpening your knives? No. Is it a handy, cheap little tool to help you keep your knife as functional as possible in a camping/backpacking scenario? Absolutely. Granted, you don't exactly have options when it comes to the grind angle, so for those who know what that is and wish to maintain it on their own knives, perhaps a small sharpening stone would be better for you.
1416955070|5.0|I was referred to this book by a friend and Iloved it. I believe fans of Stephanie Meyers will enjoy City of Bones as well. Its got a bit of romance, a bit of mystery and a lotta action. Looking forward to continuing the adventure in book 2.
B00BN3ECTS|4.0|Sparks crosses over from strictly chick flick to a bit of suspense in this one.  Josh Duhamel does his usual outstanding job in what is a better picture than those in which he has appeared in the past.  Hough did a serviceable job in a role that could have used a little more horsepower than she brought to bear.  One can't complain that she wasn't cute enough, of course.  The child actors were awesome.  But the real star was Southport where much of the movie takes place.  It has never looked better (and it has been in a lot of movies as well as in the current TV series Under the Dome).  I expect to watch this movie at least once a year - probably at the beach.

B007ZXK08C|5.0|Wow.  Wow.  Wow.<br /><br />Holy mother of God... or should that be holy mother of all things evil?  It has been a few days since I finished Gone Girl and I am still in a state of... what exactly I have no idea.  Anger?  Shock?  Acceptance?<br /><br />I have no idea how I am going to write this review.<br /><br />\\"My mother had always told her kids: if you're about to do something, and you want to know if it's a bad idea, imagine seeing it printed in the paper for all the world to see.\\"<br /><br />There is so little detail that I can go into in regards to the actual plot, as I refuse to give any of it away.  I'm sure this will not be the first review you will have read about Gone Girl, and probably not the last.  But, I want to stress how important it is that you stay with this book.<br /><br />What do I mean by that?  Well, the first half has been quoted as being a little on the boring side.  I have to admit that I never felt that way... while I reading it.  But when the story completely exploded at just over the 50% mark it is a non-stop roller coaster ride till the very end.  So in retrospect, I can now look back at the first 50% and agree that yes, in comparison it was much slower.  However, the first half is a requirement.  You must get to know these characters.  You would never have been able to get to where you are emotionally at the start of Part Two if there was never a Part One.<br /><br />\\"Love makes you want to be a better man.  But maybe love, real love, also gives you permission to just be the man you are.\\"<br /><br />And what about the ending?  You will feel manipulated once you finished.  You will sit and stare at the final paragraph, you will want to throw the book, and or your reading device at the closest wall.  You will sit and stew over all of what you have read, wondering how things got to that final paragraph.  Then you will find yourself smiling.  Why?  Heck, you won't even know why... because I sure didn't.  I wanted to be angry, I wanted to scream, but in the end all I could do was smile.  To be fair it was probably one of those crazed, psycho killer smiles, but to be honest I would expect no other kind of smile after reading Gone Girl.<br /><br />\\"There's something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and feeling utterly cold.\\"<br /><br />So yeah, this is a strange review to have written but I just refuse to spoil anything.  My only suggestion to you is READ THIS BOOK.  There is a film being made, which at the time of this review says will be out in 2015.  I have to say, I think this will translate perfectly on the big screen.  They are filming the movie in a small river town in Missouri, not too far from where I was born and grew up in Southern Illinois.  Be it this review, other reviews, the film due out a bit later... whatever it is that helps you to decide to read this book, just please choose to read this book.

B00A6WSTIW|1.0|I like this movie quite a bit but the recent attempt to watch it on amazon prime on my HD tv did not go so well.  The movie froze after 11 minutes in and wouldn't play.  Repeated the attempt twice more before I gave up and watched regular tv channels.

B007VDN1PA|1.0|This is my first Amazon review so I hope that lends some credibility to the depth of my concerns. This is the first time I felt this disappointed about a purchase that I wanted to share my experience. I spent weeks scouring reviews trying to find the perfect solution for archiving 39 years worth of slides and negatives. The first question was flatbed scanner with film attachment or dedicated film/slide scanner? I concluded that a dedicated unit would most likely have better results scanning film because, well, that is their only purpose in life. I was willing to spend $100-$200 for a low end consumer model but was unable to find one that had a high enough rating that it seemed like a no brainer. I finally saw how popular this model was and didn't see any negative comments that scared me away so I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />I eagerly opened my box from Amazon. To their credit, the item shipped super fast even with standard shipping and was very well packaged. I am very pleased with them on this transaction from order to delivery, as always. I opened the product box and took everything out. All items present and accounted for. My first reaction was that the unit was incredibly light. I examined it and felt like it was maybe one generation ahead of the old viewmaster I had as a kid in terms of quality and construction. For $79 I wasn't expecting machined aluminum, but the whole thing just kind of felt cheap. Other than that, everything you need to scan is there in the box and well packaged.<br /><br />I first plugged scanner into the wall, but then realizing I didn't have an extra memory card laying around, I decided to run it out of a USB port on my computer. You can scan 10 images on the unit's internal memory if you decide not to use a separate memory card, which is convenient for small batches and testing. Bear in mind, you cannot view the image through your computer at any point. You basically do everything you need to do on the machine, then press a button to switch to USB transfer, and cut and paste the image into a folder on your PC as if it was a flash drive. Then you can open and manipulate the file in whatever image editing software you choose to use. Thus, making good scans is a back and forth process. You can view the image live on the little screen on the unit, but the display is about as good as a digital camera display from ten years ago. You can't really use it to do anything other than confirm the image you are looking at and the most basic adjustments. I found that the images all get washed out in the default settings so I dropped the exposure setting down a notch or two. That's pretty much the only image adjustment you can make, besides flipping and rotating. Everything else you need to do in post production on your computer.<br /><br />All the parts and pieces seemed to work ok. The on-screen menu was a little rudimentary and initially difficult to navigate through, but once you figure out how to manipulate everything (about 15 minutes) you'll realize how incredibly simple the whole process is. Once you get in your rhythm, you can start cranking out scans. It really is fast, you can do about 5 slides a minute. I do like that it is a standalone unit so you can sit on the couch and watch tv while going through a stack of slides.<br /><br />Here is my biggest complaint and the ultimate deal breaker, and it really is a function of my own expectations. My goal for this thing was to scan slides and negatives, to make decent digital images to send to friends by email and to post online. From time to time, I'd like to make a 5x7 print to put in a frame for someone's desk. 35mm film, if shot well, will get you up to an 11x14 print without significant issues with resolution. I had no expectation that for $79 I was going to get a giant poster size museum quality archival print. I only wanted two things. A good image on the computer and a good image on a small print. Even using the 10MP setting, I couldn't getan image that was anywhere near satisfactory. I felt like I wanted to reach inside and find some kind of focus mechanism but there is nothing like that anywhere. Again, my goal was to be able to digitally archive my negatives and slides so that I could retire them once and for all and use those images for all future reference. I couldn't get anything close to that. I wanted to include a picture sample but haven't figured out how.<br /><br />In my sample batch, the original Kodachrome processed slides were taken by a decent photographer. They are well composed, very well exposed and the detail in the original slides are, in my opinion, exceptional. I could take them to a local lab and get some really nice, large size prints from them. I know the originals are as good as they get for 35mm. I printed a 4x6 on my printer and the image looks like I had a few beers in me first. The words and lines were not sharp at all. I wouldn't use this for anything more than a small website post on a blog or something casual like that where the image was very much reduced.<br /><br />I can honestly say that I got a better image scanning the original Walgreen's 4x6 prints I already had using my $49 scanner than I did from the scan of the source slides on this machine. I have a sub-10 megapixel camera that produces a better digital image than this. I've spent two days trying to get myself to like this piece of equipment, but I just don't have it in me. Maybe I got a dud. I will be returning it with the following plan. First, I will try the next step up, like the Wolverine F2D20 which says 20MP so I am hoping it will be more generous with the resolution. If for some reason that doesn't work, I will spend a couple hundred on a good flatbed scanner with some kind of film attachment. If that doesn't work, I will just forget the project for a while until I can save enough money to go with a nice used Plustek or Nikon product.<br /><br />I try not to be too critical but there are so many positive reviews, I wanted to at least tell my side of the story for anyone who is in the same position with the same goals as me. It was because of the other positive reviews that I made my decision to buy this item. None of the other reviews I read are wrong, but for someone trying to accomplish what I am trying to accomplish, this was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't use this for anything more than maybe a low resolution digital catalog so that I could open a folder on my computer and determine which items are in a particular slide carousel or sleeve of negatives without having to hold them up to my desk lamp. I wouldn't rank this item much higher than toy status. I am thankful for Amazon's generous return policy.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really loved the first book in the series. Catching Fire seemed to get bogged down in the Katniss, Peeta, Gale dilemma. I found that getting rather tedious. However, my interest picked back up once the Quell started. I then wanted to complete reading it to find out what was to happen to the characters. I am on the 3rd book now and this one again seems more intriguing to me than this one.

B0090SI42Y|4.0|A mix of spaghetti westerns and classic cult Chinese style karate, this movie is a really good one if you enjoy that style. Adding the interesting side stories, the blood splatter from the unique weapons, and the hip hop music that mildly plays throughout the movie, this is<br />a fun movie to watch and enjoy. Yes, it has a lot of Tarantino style in<br />it but still it is refreshingly good<br />Again a must watch for people that enjoy that kind of karate movies

B009YN2M7S|4.0|Spark's Safe Haven has managed to evoke from this reader the full gambit of human emotions. If your not ready to experience life uncensored, then replace this book on the shelf where you found. The story takes the reader along the path of a woman falling in love, fleeing from torment, learning to live again, fighting for her life and finally finding true happiness with a nice surprising twist in the end. But Don't take my word for it...brace yourself for the journey.

0307271080|5.0|This has been a summer of reading Adichie for me.  I enjoy her writing style and her keen insights into life in Nigeria.<br />Americanah tells of the things that tie an exchange student to the United States, but also what ties her to her home.<br />Adichie’s masterful story telling takes us to Nigeria, to Ivy League campuses, and back to Nigeria and lets us learn about heartache of many kinds.<br />If there is any fault to this book, it might be that it over- reaches at times and tries very hard to tell a lot.  What the reader may come away with is a glimmer…an idea of life for persons seeking something better (which may turn out to be a bland meal) and the heart ache of returning to your home to find it no longer really is your home.  It helped me to understand a lot, and I urge anyone looking for a great read to consider Americanah by one of Nigeria’s newest, most wonderful writers.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|I just love anything written by Morricone, and Yo-Yo Ma plays it so perfectly.  Makes me cry it is so beautiful!
1616202416|5.0|This has been a summer of reading Adichie for me.  I enjoy her writing style and her keen insights into life in Nigeria.<br />A purple hibiscus is a rare flower.  In the book we find that a hibiscus while beautiful and seemingly fragile can survive in the most difficult of circumstances.  Just so, fragile children, fragile women, and indeed fragile families made so by strong men can survive.<br />Adichie takes a look once again at life in the big man lane in Nigeria.  But she also keenly notes the suffering of families and of children.  Most exciting perhaps is her insightful look into how families come to grips with the rituals of the traditional and the rituals of the new.  The reader also learns how a man’s yearning for the perfect family perfectly corrupts the family he has; how his desire for his children not only to achieve but overachieve throw him and his family into chaos.<br />I give an enthusiastic thumbs up to this sister of the Diaspora as she seeks to inform, to entertain and to tell what is true.  Great reading.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I love the game, great repetitive builder with collection of resources and fun mini games. However, soon after I started playing I saw my battery Preformance tank. A full charge would be down to 15 percent in under five minutes. Even when I did not play the game I couldn't keep a charge. While plugged in it was still draining. When I checked I am gsam battery monitor I learned it was running in the background despite closing it in the program manager and was using over 90 percent of the background processor allocation. I cannot recommend getting hooked on this game or downloading it. Sorry. Samsung galaxy s2
0064471837|5.0|I read this one almost a decade ago and it quickly became one of my favorites I've read in a long time. It is dark and Nix rarely gives his protagonist (or the reader) time to breathe, which for me made it all the more exciting. Though written for a young adult audience, it is one of those that any age upward will enjoy thoroughly.<br /><br />Moreover in world creation he's made something which has elements of the familiar but unique elements as well so that it all is fresh and fascinating. The magic of bells and how they are used are exciting, fascinating, and there's so much in this book that hints at more just enough to make it tantalizing.<br /><br />This is a book I love to re-read. This is a book that makes me want more and more. I always recommend it to people looking for books. If you're reading reviews, I recommend it to you. LOOK HOW MANY STARS WE GAVE THIS BOOK! WHY ARE YOU STILL WAFFLING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO READ IT?! READ THE BOOK!<br /><br />Ahem. I'll be calm. Great book; please enjoy.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I know a lot of people still crave about Mayer's blues and instantly balk at his new country-folk sound. But music is not just the sound, don't let the sound alone become a barrier instead of a carrier of something deeper, something your mind finds alien but your heart can recognize instantly if you keep it open.<br /><br />OK, first week impression. This feels like summer. It has a much lighter feel than Born&Raised, both music and lyric wise, but no less heartfelt than B&R and actually a quite welcoming ease of the spirit perfectly set for summer. It goes back to the essence of the country, not cliched honky-tonk radio country. A very organic and warm, breezy record. And his voice and singing are better than ever. And the guitar, very JJ Cale-esque, which I love and very fitting.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|The Rock of Ages DVD made a great gift idea and the length of time it took to arrive to Seoul, South Korea is very acceptable...
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This movie focuses on the event as experienced by one family. While I know editorial license goes into every film, The Impossible gives a balanced look at the experiences by both parents and the oldest child. The acting is excellent, as is the pacing of the days after the typhoon. I had tears of joy and sorrow throughout!<br /><br />There are some scenes that were particularly gruesome (and I enjoy Walking Dead!), but overall is appropriate for young teens and up, I think.<br /><br />I admit to being disappointed to learn after watching that the actual family is Spanish, yet are portrayed as British. I can pass that off as a marketing choice, and while I can't say I didn't love the actors chosen, that distinction puts the story more fictional than based on reality, in my mind.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game although needs more levels. Difficulty is common sense mostly. If objects do not work look around more or just start tapping areas that look unusual. Fun but short lived.
B004EF65QA|5.0|I have yet to read the book, but downloaded it and Gaskell's other books after watching this movie repeatedly. The acting is outstanding, the scenery and costumes very fitting for the era. The story itself is so romantic, filled with character growth and conflict. You won't stop with a single viewing of this one!

B007IXWKUK|1.0|Ok, it's an interesting premise, the newbie gets introduced to bdsm (yes, its been done but a new telling is a new telling) but the execution and character development were not there (check out Patience by Lisa Valdez for better execution). I bought this book to see what was the hype was about and then forced myself to finish it because I'm no quitter. In retrospect, I wish I had quit. The male love interest has no redeeming qualities other than he's rich (great, you can ride in his helicopter while he man handles you). He's a stalker, control freak, and never redeems himself; he just gets worse and she just gives more and more of her freedom, choice, self respect (in tedious repetive scene after scene) to a good looking penis who controls her. Not so much romance as stalker/abuse 101. I'm going to pass on recommending to others. 50 shades turned out to be much ado about nothing.

B000JO9JHW|5.0|This is my favorite show and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a little mystery and has a stomach to see a lot of blood.  I'm a nurse, the blood doesn't bother me.  I love the concept of the show, a serial killer as the hero.
B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|I Love Kings Of Leon and knew I would love their collection set. I have been wanting to get this for a while now and am so happy I finally did. I would recommend this to any true KOL fan!
B009JNXK88|4.0|I enjoyed this game quite a bit as a time waster, but I was hoping for lengthy levels. It's great the way it is, and I would recommend to the developers to make a full adventure game using this engine later on. The controls work great on the Kindle Fire, and had no problems playing this game. Great job, guys!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game. can't stop playing. I really have nothing to complain about.keep up the great games. love love love
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is always challenging but fun.  I like when they tell me what my best score is so I can work to improve my results.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I don't know how many years now I've silently hoped for a new Bowie album. As each year went by, it seemed less and less likely. Imagine my joy when on his 66th birthday, a new single and music video were released and news of a new album slated for a March release came about. I was super excited!<br /><br />Much of Bowie's work in the late 90s and into the early 00's took on a bit more electronic feel, very different from the pure rock and roll sound of great albums like Ziggy Stardust. While still very much Bowie, they weren't always well received. One fear you might have is that this new album could be similar to those later albums. However, this is not the case! The Next Day is a return to more of the classic rock sound Bowie was well known and loved for.<br /><br />Each song is powerful in its own way and has a message to convey. Bowie's voice still sounds amazing and the music itself is great. While unlikely that Bowie will tour in the future, we still get this glorious treat. Some tracks to check out include &#34;The Next Day,&#34; &#34;The Stars (Come Out Tonight),&#34; &#34;Valentine's Day,&#34; and &#34;&#34;(You Will) Set the World on Fire.&#34;
B00005JSGK|5.0|I love this movie. I used to watch it with my dad and learned how to play many of the songs on the piano!
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have an immense catalog of recordings and I admit I'm not entirely well versed in most of them. However, this latest offering from The Bad Seeds has an incredible depth to it, and dare I say, softness? Cave took a different approach to writing the lyrics for this album by perusing Wikipedia and pulling up articles of interest to him. Most of the music wasn't ready in advance of recording, just something the group pieced together bit by bit as they were in the studio. While a bit mellow compared to prior Bad Seeds albums (such as Murder Ballads), I think this album goes to show why Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds remain such a compelling force after all these years. Some tracks I'd recommend checking out are &#34;We Know Who U R,&#34; &#34;Water's Edge,&#34; and &#34;Push the Sky Away.&#34;
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The Hunger Games movie: I enjoyed it but I wouldn't watch it again. I hope the premise never becomes reality!
B0058VW36U|5.0|At first I thought this was a simple kids game and bought it at the recommendation of a 5 yr old. I quickly discovered a challenging game that works gives your brain a work out.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Enjoy using it as a time filler. I pop in several times a day to collect coins. Ratio of earnings vs. Need to spend to keep up with goals seems to be in line. Need more ways to earn acorns.

B00CWY76CC|1.0|I love finding hidden objects, There is no direction to find anything, if u get something to open it don't tell u what to do, or what to look for.Fix it so that I can play the game.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Magic, mystery, peril combine to make an enchanting, somewhat melancholy tale.  Neil Gaiman captured me again and drew me into another world that lies right up against ours.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really like this story.  Very in depth with feelings & what's going on with the characters.  Seems all real!
0449011909|5.0|The story is very good and the guy who reads the story is a very gifted &#34;actor&#34; who reads all the myriad of characters (and there are many, many characters) with different accents, tones, etc. that really makes the story both come alive and also makes it much easier to follow the story lines.  I listen to audio books all the time and this is one of the best I've ever listened to.
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|This movie is great. I saw it at the movie theather. Great sory and very funny. With popcorn it cost me $25.00 and was worth every penny.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really enjoy this bingo game. It has cute themes and you get daily credits. You can share items with your friends on facebook.
B008220D5K|1.0|This is the worst movie I have enver seen. Don't waste your money. The best part was removing the dvd from the player.
0307352153|4.0|I've always thought of myself as an introvert who, out of necessity, acts the extrovert. &#34;...meetings are toxic...&#34; Truer words have ne'er been spoken. Those who enjoy meetings are those who enjoy hearing the sound of their own voice ad nauseum.
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|Great CD with crazy riffs and enough screaming to blow your year drums out. Love the CD and the lyrics behind the songs!
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Tom Cruise never disappoints - great twists and turns with the plot - i loved the ending - didn't see it coming.  Special effects were great - Morgan Freeman was superb.
B003CGOXR0|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite King stories. I read it years ago and will definitely read it again one day.  I am just catching up on my reviews.  I wouldn't say it is scary, at least not to me, because I don't scare easily at all, but you can make up your own mind- to each their own!  This story was creepy to me though, especially the scenes where Pennywise is lurking in the sewers.  I also loved the parts about the spider- good original stuff.  I feel SK had a home run with this novel.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|What's not to like? I have never understood the &#34;Weber Bashers&#34; and have pretty much loved everything he has done since being introduced to his work with Jesus Christ Superstar in the late 70s.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS GAME IS ADDICTING AND SO MUCH FUN!  THIS IS A MUST HAVE!  I THINK IT'S THE GAME OF THE YEAR!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Sweet clock love it . Get it  everyone should have it. Had a little bit of trouble downloading to kindle but I got it can't wait to use it. Very handy to have.
0811876373|5.0|This book was a gift to a friend along with an electric cake pop baker.  She made the Mickey and Minnie Mouse cake pops for a party and they came out very cute.  Although she said it was not easy, she did tell me that they were a big hit.  The ideas and photos in the book are clever and adorable.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The premise of this movie caught my eye and I couldn't wait to see the film. It was definitely worth the wait. Every aspect of this movie is well done - colors, game like graphics, animation, plot, humor, etc...

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is a fun and strategy game great for kids and its a lot like the movies in a way it makes you feel as if you are in the movies
B005MMZ63C|5.0|This was my first time seeing this movie and it stands the test of time. Great story and characterization. Very well told.
030789701X|5.0|The book arrived safely at my post office with no damage in a discreet package. (I live in outback Australia, this book came from the USA). The guide is fantastically thorough. It came exactly as described with the maps and poster. It is very well written with lots of images and is very entertaining. It has already helped me gain a better insight into the way to play the game and get more out of the game/have more fun with the game. If you have Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition, get this guide, it is worth every septim!
B000P0J09C|5.0|It's perhaps one of Stanley Kubrick's best work.  The acting was superb.  Leo DonOfrio and Matthew Modine were outstanding in their respective roles.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to get glimpse of what the Viet Nam war was all about.  Very profound filmaking.<br />  Bob Pici
B009YP9L7U|5.0|All i can simply say is how true this book is. throughout the whole book i will forever wish i could just wake up and be married...<3
B009JBZH54|4.0|When I initially saw each of the films in this trilogy I hated them.  Upon each subsequent viewing they grew on me so much that by the third or fourth time of watching each one I've really grown to like them.  Bale's Batman gets a little redundant, but its the other characters that really shine in this series.  Oldman's Gordon was so interesting throughout that I found myself wishing he'd get his own movie.  Ledger's Joker was okay, but after watching the original Batman I found myself preferring Nicholson, but I also realized that while Batman may be stale as a character sometimes, it really is those around him (sidekicks and villains) that have made the movies and comics so fun over the years.

140006922X|5.0|Excellent insight into the historical Jesus of Nazareth, who, contrary to the church Jesus is very different from what was presented in the New Testament accounts.  Reza Aslan presented verifiable historical facts, and he did so in a very readable format--history is far different from the story presented in religion.  I found it credible that the name Jesus was one of the more common names during that era, and so common in fact, one had to designate either a place of birth after the name Jesus for differentiation, or add the father's surname after the name Jesus to even begin to know which Jesus was being written about.  Furthermore, I found it fascinating history to read that Jesus of Nazareth was actually crucified (executed) for the crime of treason and sedition, having opposed the Roman Empire and lost.  I highly recommend this book for any person who has an open mind to historical truths, one who has not been fully and completely indoctrinated by Christian teachings to the point of not considering other possibilities and explanations for who this man named Jesus of Nazareth actually happened to have been.
0307949508|5.0|This book keeps one guessing and just about the time I think I know what is next--bam-- something totally different comes up.

B008U6QANC|5.0|This is a shockingly good record and the vinyl is a superb pressing.  This is not something I'd typically say these days about United Record Pressing, but there was no lack of quality control here.  Double 45 rpm LPs as well.  It rules.
B00CEZJT2E|3.0|I ordered 2 of these chargers and unfortunately had to return them. I had high hopes for this since I have a friend who uses the Slim2.  I'm sad to say that one of the units stopped working the first day.  It would not charge and was totally unresponsive even when plugged in to a power source.  The other charger worked sometimes but other times just wouldn't turn on to charge.  I did contact Anker and they were kind to offer replacements but in the end I just didn't have the confidence in this product to try another one.  It's a great concept and design except for the micro USB cable.  I think most people will have to remove their cases to use it.  Hopefully, my bad experience is one of a very small few.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/11/13:<br />Anker contacted me and offered to send me another unit of theirs to try.  I now have the Astro Slim 2 and it's given me a very consistent performance.  Their commitment to making me a satisfied customer is top notch and can't be beat.  As a result, I'm adding another star to my rating.
0767802470|5.0|This is a classic.  The movie itself is a must for any submarine enthusiast.  Good sharp video and crisp sound.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|&#34;The Good Wife&#34; isn't the greatest tv but if you are a Julianna Margulies fan and love being entertained this series is for you.  Her enigmatic behaviour drives the plot, wondering which way she'll go kept me coming back for more, more, more.<br /><br />Plus some of the camera work is above and beyond.  Closing shots where they just stay on her face letting her do what great actresses do are fantastic.<br /><br />Through it all she is prim and proper. Her monosyllabic answers are a mix of lawyerly caution as well as feminine reserve.  I find her completely fascinating.<br /><br />There are few ways better to spend forty minutes.

B009ZXT4BY|5.0|My son downloaded the demo f this game and begged me to get the paid version so I broke down and bought it for the kids. It's very similar to Minecraft but it has better mobs and is WAY better than Minecraft Pocket Edition (which I also own). There is no multiplayer over LAN or WAN which is a let down but it's still a fun game to kill some time.
0679847367|5.0|Purchased for a long term gift - will have all of my daughters teachers sign it until graduation (12 yrs from now) and the case is sure to protect it over the years, before and after I give it away.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I played it three times and finally killed the world on &#34;normal&#34; but playing it on hard I haven't been able to kill the world. As more people are infected to the point the whole world is infected you don't get any more DNA points which are used to mutate your plague so it gets really hard to finish the game on normal and brutal (I think it was called brutal) settings. Overall it's a fun game.
B00DHHWYAW|4.0|The Great Gatsby, and indeed any film by director [[ASIN:B000SVZIDA Baz Luhrmann]], is a love-it or hate-it experience. He took Shakespeare's revered tale of Romeo and Juliet, updated it to present day Miami, added six-shooters, explosions, and neon lights, but kept the source material's vibrant heart. But [[ASIN:B0012HRJEA Romeo + Juliet]], like Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge worked. Like The Great Gatsby, they worked because they had colour, vibrant energy, an excellent cast, and Baz's typical spirit and OTT action ingrained in them.<br /><br />They're not perfect. [[ASIN:0743273567 The Great Gatsby]] by F. Scott Fitzgerald is not just the possible holder of the mythical title \\"Great American Novel\\", but one of the finest works of fiction period. A haunting, caustic look at wealth, money, decadence, love, and the American Dream, The Great Gatsby, in it's 50,000 words, manages to be both vividly written, hauntingly affecting, and timelessly relevant. Go on and read it. Your English teacher was right.<br /><br />But how does it translate to film? Not seamlessly. I still have NO idea why it was released in 3D. This decision seems ultimately misguided; how many novels written in the Twenties are going to be released in the Third Dimension? The Catcher in the Rye? The Beyonc&eacute; and Jay-Z and will.i.am black rap may seem questionable to purists, and certainly jarred a large portion of the audience I watched the film with. And do we really need CGI sets and zooming shoots and kinetic driving scenes in a film about excess in the Jazz Age? One of my big gripes with the film is with the (otherwise) emotional scene in the garden between Daisy and Gatsby. We should be swept up in their tale of doomed love, and in the phenomenal acting, but whatisthat? GREEN SCREEN. Obvious, fake GREEN screen in a scene in the garden. Cheap, or was it part of Baz Luhrmann's effect?<br /><br />Endless debate can be sparked on these topics. The real issue for me is harder to pin down. The film...the performances...seemed so...HOLLOW. Like it was all colour and light and splendour on the outside, but inside it was empty and hollow and lifeless. Carrie Mulligan in particular felt so empty-headed and vapid.<br /><br />Or was this all intentional? Was Mulligan's performance intended to represent that selfsame attribute of Daisy; empty-headed, filled with faux-girlish innocence that revealed a sad, tortured girl inside? Did the emptiness of The Great Gatsby represent the hollowness of the American Dream that Nick Carraway finds so evident? Does the vapidity of the characters Gatsby and Tom and Daisy reflect the vapidity and fickleness that our narrator, Nick Carraway uncovers? I don't rightly know...<br /><br />But the movie wasn't terrible. The Great Gatsby has a lot of things going for it.<br /><br />The first half of the film has almost palpable energy. The Jazz Age was a terrific time to be alive, and Luhrmann shows us the wondrous new land of New York according to the relatively innocent Nick Carraway; cheap booze, flappers, the Charleston, riotous parties, confetti, fireworks, Jazz, big cars, grand castles, mysterious people, and lots and lots of money. In short, this is decadence and excess to the full.<br /><br />A pity then, that it seems to lose this vigour in the second half. Again, maybe this is intentional and it's all me. The tonal shift is abrupt - from happy to sad - but the film works on mostly thanks to it's talented cast.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000NGTJTY Leonardo DiCaprio]] has come far from his Titanic/Romeo + Juliet days; no longer is he the pretty boy and teenage heart-throb. This is an incredibly versatile, charismatic, talented, and potentially brilliant actor at the top of his game. Reading the book, it is almost impossible to imagine how Gatsby could be realized onscreen, so dashing and larger-than-life was he. But DiCaprio makes it happen. He is suave, charismatic, sophisticated, sympathetic, mysterious, and charming. He is also a twisted,heartbroken, often deluded and complex soul. His multi-faceted performance is another star in his crown, which includes Blood Diamond, The Departed, Django Unchained, and hopefully many more to come. We're sorry for underestimating you, Leo.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000I9YV2Q Tobey Maguire]] is a most underrated actor, and I was sorry that I haven't seen more of him. His Nick Carraway was spot. on! Maguire captures the wide-eyed sensibility, innocence, and strong moral compass and decency of the character; not in a showy way, but in a sincere performance, becoming the focus of the audience's sympathies - Nick, who at times seems the most sane man in New York.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007FXLZ9K Carrie Mulligan]] is a rising and incredibly talented young star. Right from the get-go, her Daisy Fay is a standout performance. She captures perfectly the Daisy from Fitzgerald's book; a sincere smile, girlish innocence, and \\"a voice like money\\". Her character is not always likeable, but her portrayal is subtle and should please purists of the book. I had doubts about [[ASIN:B004GGLVAM Joel Edgerton]] as the odious Tom, but his performance was suitably animated and repelling as the boisterous and brash Tom Buchanan. [[ASIN:B00AE2KZNQ Jason Clarke]], [[ASIN:B00DWZHTRW Isla Fisher]], and newcomer Elizabeth Debicki give standout performances in the supporting casts, whose characters are  given new life in the hands of talented thespians.<br /><br />...<br /><br />I give an abnormal amount of praise to Luhrmann's talented cast, because that is what impressed me most with the film. I liked the colour that assaulted the senses, the energy almost pulsing through the films veins, the colorful and diverse score (Lana del Rey's Young and Beautiful is particularly haunting), and the subtly brilliant performances from the cast.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby left me feeling torn however. The enormous amounts of CGI and crane shots, coupled with the unnecessary 3D and the rap make this into a love-it or hate-it experience. I fall somewhere in between. I liked the movie. The Great Gatsby is like Tom Buchanan's riotous party early on in the film; new, original, colourful, exciting, but also hollow, misguided, and something that many people may want to stay away from.<br /><br />My rating?

B00ANAC32U|3.0|This was the only case on the market when I purchased my phone back in December 2012.  The cases were in high demand and I ended up having to buy one on ebay for 2.5 times what you can buy them from the Google Play Store.  The case does provide for some protection as I have dropped the phone a few times without any damage to the phone.  Now the case broke near the micro USB port (from inserting a USB cable multiple times) and LG claims there is no warranty even though the included warranty card indicates a 12 month warranty.  If you want a long lasting case, this is certainly not the one.
B0038P59A0|5.0|You could call me a purist Holmesian fan.<br /><br />Having read all 60 novels and short stories, loving those, and moving on to Jeremy Brett's brilliant Granada TV series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, then Benedict Cumberbatch's electrifying Sherlock, even dabbling in CBS's Elementary and a myriad of movies, I find myself loving most the shows and films that homaged Conan Doyle's brilliant works, while forging new paths that kept it all fresh and exciting.<br /><br />Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is a different beast. Holmes now uses his fists and whatever he can get his hands on to fight crime, becoming an almost superheroic action figure. Watson carries a gun and is not afraid to use it. The duo are battling demonic, occultic priests. Irene Adler is back and she's American (Canadian?). This is more of an action-thriller than a crime drama. Yet the movie works.<br /><br />Here's why:<br />1. The cast: There is only one [[ASIN:B001KZG99A Robert Downey Jr.]], and he has got to be one of the coolest, funniest, most charismatic actors around. He imbibes his endless charm and likeable roguishness into his every role, and Sherlock Holmes is one of his best performances. Troublesome, rude, brash, and utterly deadly with both fists and brain, his Sherlock may not stand up to Brett's or Cumberbatch's in terms of intellect or accuracy to the source material, but he sure is rivetingly madcap and entertaining. [[ASIN:B0085OELXK Jude Law]] is playing the straight man, but his Dr. Watson is not your usual stodgy sidekick. Instead, he uses his two fists and his dogged British determination to aid in crime fighting.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00DGMVJAO Eddie Marsan]] is a fantastic Lestrade; slightly thick but the spitting image of the steadfast London bobby. [[ASIN:B003XQPYR2 Mark Strong]] chews up the scenery and is cool as a cucumber (as usual!) as the sinister occultist Lord Blackwood. [[ASIN:B000YMM3CC Rachel MacAdams]] makes for a charming and devious Irene Adler.<br /><br />2. The production design: This London is gray and gritty, lit by dim street lamps, with brown mud making the wet cobblestones slippery, where the mist coming off the Thames makes an ghostly effect. The houses are small, wooden, stained with soot and grime, and positively spooky. This is a London where you could easily imagine Alistair Crowley or Jack the Ripper prowling round the corner in the fog. The scenery, costumes, and cinematography are all period accurate and atmospheric. Sherlock Holmes has other technically superb aspects: the kinetic camerawork, the rousing score by Hans Zimmer, and the muddy, gritty costumes, not to mention the dialogue, which is often very sharp and darkly comic. Let me mention the screenplay, which was (pun intended) devilishly plotted, with those fantastic aha! moments so famous in Sherlock Holmes and seemingly insignificant clues that allow our hero to use his noggin present and accounted for!<br /><br />3. Guy Ritchie: Watch [[ASIN:B000SP1SEO Snatch]] or [[ASIN:B000ID37QI Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]] if you want to know what I'm talking about. His filming style is kinetic, stylish, smooth, packed with action, engaging, and completely original. Think Quentin Tarantino meets Michael Bay. Excellently choreographed fight scenes (\\"Discombobulate...\\"), and stunning slo-motion mix with cool close-ups, camera angles, and an original style of fighting before seen only in Chinese wuxia epics - planning the fight in your head based on logic and probability. It is his wickedly cool style that elevates Sherlock Holmes among other period action flicks.<br /><br />Cons? Only that Sherlock Holmes does away with about 100 years of history and lore of Sherlock Holmes to deliver something shockingly, almost brazenly original. This is definitely NOT the books. Good thing? Bad thing? Who knows?<br /><br />In conclusion, Sherlock Holmes is wickedly engrossing and entertaining; with slick action sequences and sharp acting and writing, featuring astandout performance by Robert Downey Jr. Guy Ritchie and cast have fun, and the fun is contagious. Sherlock Holmes is a fun and cool, if a little (*ahem*) elementary night at the movies. As a Sherlock film, it makes some questionable choices, but as a dark action crime piece, it can do no wrong.<br /><br />My rating? 4.5 percent solution out of 5.standout performance by Robert Downey Jr. Guy Ritchie and cast have fun, and the fun is contagious.

B001EN71CW|2.0|I watched a few episodes after having seen the film and now, even later, have seen four more. To preface this, I absolutely love the film Serenity. I've owned it on DVD and Blu-ray and is one of my go-to films when people ask to watch something from my collection. That said, this TV series that is so beloved is somewhat lost on me. Out of the 7 episodes that I've seen, I've enjoyed two of them. The biggest problem I have is with the acting. Some of these actors are just plain bad. Difficult to watch. A few are solid. Gina Torres and Nathan Fillion make this show as watchable as it can be, but so many others, especially supporting cast members, have seemingly no experience in front of a camera. Good editing could have helped, but that, too, seems to be a weak spot for Firefly.<br /><br />I'm a fan of most of Whedon's films, but he has yet to make something for television that I could really get into. The film Serenity shows me that his concepts, characters, and stories are worth watching. Hopefully he will stick to making films where he seems not to suffer from the problems I've seen with Firefly. For those who wonder how this series could have been cancelled after just one season, I would say that were I in charge of making that decision I likely would have cancelled it as well. A lot of promise, but not executed very well as a whole.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|Life is Beautiful is truly one of the most poignant and beautiful films ever made. At once hilarious and heartwarming, and haunting and disturbing, director and star Roberto Benigni creates not just one of the finest Holocaust films of all time, but one of the saddest, happiest, heartwarming, brilliant, and truly, truly beautiful movies ever made.<br /><br />This is not your typical Hollywoodized cheesy melodramatic soap opera. No emotion feels saccharine or cheesy, no tear is not earned, and no joyous moment not truly thrilling. This is the touching story of a man who loved his child so much he would try to shield him from unspeakable characters if it meant his life. La Vita &egrave; Bella (Italian name) will take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions; from gut-bursting laughing, to joy, to sorrow, to sickening horror, disbelief, and joy again.<br /><br />If there is one thing that La Vita &egrave; Bella has to tell us, it is that Life, truly IS, beautiful. Light can triumph over darkness and there is hope even in despair. I urge you to watch this incredible film, which is both one of my favourites, and one of the greatest films ever made. It will stay with you forever; a tribute to the timeless power of cinema and the human spirit. Five Stars.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Well I like the deries on the tube.  I thought having seen them it would help.  It did kind of.  This is a hard read at least for me.  The name are not  easyto read...I would reccommend starting form the beginning of the series, there is a lot that you miss.  But over all I think it is really good.  I will finish it though.

B00CPLGGXM|3.0|Edit 9/01/13: Ok I tried it with windows 8 instead of vista. The driver support is MUCH better, I'm seeing a huge performance increase from Vista's 1.0 on the windows expierence index. Out the box I was getting 3.7 in graphics and a 4.2 in gaming graphics. That's WITHOUT the Catalsk drivers installed, WITH Catalsk drivers installed I'm getting a 6.7 in both graphics and gaming graphics in the WEI. Much better, I'm giving it 3 stars for non-existent vista driver support, had to drop $80 on a OS I don't even like. Would be 5 stars if I didn't have to waste a week of my life trying to find working drivers for the integrated graphics.<br /><br />This processor is beyond terrible, it's worse than the integrated GPU in my old dell latitude D420. My laptop is about half a decade old, and well it's a LAPTOP. A modern desktop integrated GPU should always be better than an old integrated laptop GPU, and yet it's not.<br /><br />I'm not sure what AMD's problem is but they need to either A. Release the drivers for their hardware or B. make processors that can best an low-end 5 year old laptop. I've searched AMDs main site and Google for the blasted drivers and I can't find them anywhere.<br /><br />Right now I am beyond angry with this product, I will never purchase another AMD processor again.<br /><br />Edit: I found the drivers they just don't work. I'm going to try windows 8 in a week or two.<br />Anyhow, I'll list my build to possibly help others avoid my disaster.<br /><br />CPU: AMD A10-6800k 4.4 GHz(defaulted to 4.1Ghz)<br />GPU: AMD A10-6800k's integrated GPU<br />RAM: GSKILL Sniper series 8GB 2133 MHz(Defaulted to 1600 MHz)<br />Motherboard: MSI FM2-A75MA-E35<br />Mobo bios Version: E7721AMS V2.0<br />SSD: Wintec 64Gb SSD<br />Operating system: Windows Vista Ultimate 64 bit<br /><br />Edit: My screenshot at my attempt to get beyond a 1.0 on the Windows Experience Index.<br />[...]
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I came away very impressed with Blake Crouch's mystery story set in a Stepford Wives-esque town.  I think the story works best if you go in blind, not knowing what twists are coming or where the story is headed.  I'm very interested in seeing how the TV series that is in production (as of Summer 2013) handles the material.<br /><br />Blake Crouch has a nice simple writing style that engaged me quickly and kept me interested until the end.  Some of his passages elevate the work beyond mindless entertainment (no spoilers from me, but if you have the kindle version, you'll see that many people highlighted the impressive passages).  This is a great standalone book, so I'm a little hesitant to see what he has planned for the sequels.  Regardless, this is a story worth checking out.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|love love love love love love. it Just like the regular card game u can even cheat.  I think you should get it
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I love the 1st couple of books in the series, but had to force myself to trudge through this one. Is he getting paid by the word? I wish I had Cliffnotes...
B00CEK9OTM|2.0|I didn't hate this game, i simply didn't enjoy it. The game was well made, and the graphics were smooth, this was simply not a game I happened to enjoy. It wasn't quite what I expected.
B00006690G|4.0|Due to watching a biography about Eminem, I know about his past. I don't care for the amount of cussing in the album, but I am not perfect with my vocabulary either. I was hoping he would show off his talent more. &#34;Without me&#34; and a few other songs were very good. I can't say that for the rest of the album.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie my entire life. Maybe you have too. Ever since I was a wide-eyed kid watching Star Wars on a color TV in glorious Dolby Stereo, I've been dreaming about monsters and technological wonders. I've been watching summer blockbusters for so long I must have eaten enough popcorn to fill the Grand Canyon. So naturally if you're one of those people who absolutely hate summer blockbusters, giant robots, Kaiju, good acting, smart writing, lovable characters, spectacular visuals, and having fun...well this movie and certainly this review ain't gonna change your mind. If on the other hand, you, like me, played with LEGOs as a child and pretended you were building spaceships, if you walked through your LEGO town pretending you were Godzilla, if you laughed and cried and cheered from sheer overwhelming awesome watching Gundam and Macross and every other giant robot show you could get your salty-snack and soda-stained fingers on...then your moment has finally arrived. And it is GLORIOUS!!!!<br /><br />Independence Day, Jurassic Park, Men in Black, Star Wars, Indiana Jones. You know this type of movie. It's about lovable characters going on amazing adventures and larger-than-life heroes saving the day before bedtime. This film is everything you would expect, and much, much, MUCH more. Just make sure you open your eyes, and your mind's eyes as well. Because while this film resembles your typical blockbuster, it is ANYTHING but typical.<br /><br />A visual masterpiece<br /><br />Within weeks of the release of this film there were people announcing they were starting conventions for it on the Internet. There were also long articles written about the film's visual genius. What the heck are they talking about? It's a movie for kids about giant robots and monsters! Or is it? Look. No, closer. CLOSER. Notice how you learn about characters by not just what they say (and don't say) but by their body stance and facial expression? Notice the enormous amount of personality you get from characters who barely have any lines of dialog at all? How about how someone's HAIR COLOR ties in with a visual cue from their back-story told in memory flashback? No? Doesn't work for you? Okay, maybe you noticed the EXTRAORDINARY amount of detail in the backgrounds? No, I'm not talking about random junk flying around in the background like in Star Wars Episode 1, stuff that has NOTHING to do with the story. No, no NO! I'm talking about the insignia on people's uniforms, the billboards and signs in the backgrounds. The stuff that makes this movie have STYLE and feel like a living breathing world of giant robot/giant monster awesome. What's that you say? You only care about the obvious? You detest analyzing anything no matter how awesome the treasures hidden? Fine then. There's always...<br /><br />Explosive Action!<br /><br />Okay, you saw this coming in the trailer. Giant Robots smashing and bashing and slicing and dicing through giant monsters! The CGI in this film is very, VERY good. Everything just feels...REAL. Everything has weight, mass, inertia. Nothing looks silly or cartoonish. And all of the amazing effects are BEAUTIFULLY framed and photographed. Seriously, incredible cinematography is on showcase for this film. The kind of stuff you could frame and hang up on your wall or buy a new Plasma TV and a Blu Ray player for. Wait...you say you're tired of stuff that makes you think AND you want a good story? You're a tough customer but you're still in for it because...<br /><br />\\"For my family!\\"<br /><br />That's right, even if you are too stupid to notice things in the background and too grown up to want to see nothing but mind-blowing-awesomeness for a few hours, this movie STILL deserves all your love, because it has AMAZING story and character development for a film of this type. As opposed to summer blockbusters that have shallow, stereotypical characterizations (Fighter Pilot, Punk, Asian Chick, Nerdy Scientist) that you couldnever believe in a million years (there's something about supermodels playing Russian physicists that stretches the bounds of all reason), these characters manage to be ARCHETYPES that still have great emotional depth. Good-natured Raleigh, who takes insults with a smile but will knock you out if you use foul language to describe a lady. Newt, the Kaiju fanboy-turned-scientist in love with the object of his study.  Stacker Pentecost (admit it, you love that name), the commander keeping a cool head and an open heart as he fights to save the world. And Mako....oh man, Mako! Mako manages to be...perfect. She's a woman, fighting to overcome childhood emotional turmoil. She's a realist, not afraid to tell the truth like it is. She's a fighter, not afraid to go toe-to-toe with anyone. She's a shy girl, who gets embarrassed when she's awkward, smiles like a schoolgirl when she's happy, and when she fails, gets right to the edge of tears and still holds it in. The actress who plays Mako....is AMAZING. Yeah, yeah, you say. That's all great. But does it have a rock'n soundtrack I could download to my iPod and run a mile to or blast in the morning to get me out of bed? Got you now, haven't I Mr. Reviewer!?!?<br /><br />Like a rocket powered punch<br /><br />Anyone seen Iron Man? Yeah, so have I. The same composer created the soundtrack to this movie, and honestly, it just might be his best work. The main theme of the picture is downright inspiring. And gets the blood pumping . It's a rock-infused symphonic delight that suits the picture perfectly, with nary a boring track in sight. It's got it's slower, more dramatic moments to be sure, but this is a popcorn flick, not an Oscar-bait film so most of soundtrack is meant to get into the awesome action and story onscreen. Which it does very well. Just got ahead and buy it already! Ok, ok, you can listen to it on YouTube first if you're such a doubter. Moving right along...<br /><br />Not a War Movie But an Adventure Movie<br /><br />This was a movie made by people who love monsters and giant robots FOR people who love monsters and giant robots. The director himself said so. Yes, there's plenty of drama to go around. From a father's concern for his son and partner to a commander having to let go of his adopted daughter. There's tragedy and loss, but that's not what this movie is about. This film is OVERWHELMINGLY about the spirit of idealism that is sadly lacking in the world today. It's not about a country saving the world. It's about the world saving the world (again, the director's words, not mine). It's about people coming together for a common cause. There's peril and some downers, but overwhelmingly this film is about the director's passion for his subject, and your passion for it as well. The jokes will make you smile. The characters will make you love them. The fights will make you squeal with delight. And if you have a heart that's open and idealistic and you love to have fun, you WILL love this movie. If you don't like giant robots, if you don't like monsters, if you don't like rock music, or good special effects, or good acting, or interesting characters, or pretty visuals....you should probably avoid this movie  and every other summer blockbuster that ever gets released in the future.never believe in a million years (there's something about supermodels playing Russian physicists that stretches the bounds of all reason), these characters manage to be ARCHETYPES that still have great emotional depth.

B009JBZH54|5.0|great movies for a great price!!!! I would recommend this purchase to all dark knight fans, thank you thanks to all
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I just woke up, and wanted something to pass the time while my coffee was brewing, and found this. My coffee went cold before I got to it while playing this game! Nice, addicting little app!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|One of the best series of games put there. Perfect to pick up during your lunch break. Challenging without being frustrating.
0307165485|5.0|I remember loving this as a child so I made sure I had it for my daughter.  It has wonderful stories, lots to look at, interesting pages for talking and word learning, and definitely increases vocabulary.  It as the wonderful illustrations that are sweet and appealing.  It's a must have for any child's library.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|A great cast usually results in a good movie, and this one is a home run. Can't wait for the sequel.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Some great interweaving stories that left me wanting more. Time to get the next book to carry on the story.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I was hesitant about buying the Withings Pulse. I've used the FitBit in the past and wanted the same type of data.<br /><br />The Pulse does everything the FitBit does, and also can check your heartbeat. If you need to check it, it's a cool feature, but for me, that's a novelty. The Pulse syncs your data to your phone (I use an iPhone and it works well), but sometimes slow. I don't know what frequency it syncs, but I often look at the app and find current details are not there yet. I'm sure this saves on battery, and you do have the option to sync it manually.<br /><br />The one drawback with the Pulse is the recording of food. Fitbit has the food database within it's app, but the Pulse recommends a separate app (MyFitnessPal). The MyFitnessPal app does do an excellent job, but it would be nice if the features were integrated within one app instead of two. The Withings web based page is also pretty decent, but again, it would be nice to integrate the food/exercise into it.<br /><br />All in all, I like the Withings Pulse better than the Fitbit. I get the same type of data, decent accuracy and the belt clip is more sturdy, so I don't feel like I'll lose this one (I lost two Fitbits because they disappeared from my belt).
B007TVANDM|5.0|Only thing is the book should come with the music. The song is the greatest. If you haven't heard the song it makes no sense.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have bought several steaming media devices from Netgear Neo200, LG Smart Media Player, and GoogleTV units. This is the best of them all for the price you can't beat it. I have SMART TVs as well with Youtube and Netflix built in, however things just work better with the ChromeCast.<br /><br />I would buy another when it is available. I bought one for my mom and now she is able to display her favorite video content from her computer to the TV easily.<br /><br />Definitely worth the money, wish it was more readily available.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a hard hitting, rough riding show about a motorcycle club who's had a lot of ups and downs.  With their old president out and the new president (Jax) taking over,  the club is moving in the right direction.  Although Jax has his work cut out for himself, he is by far a good leader and friend to many.<br />I really like this show and would recommend you watching the whole series, which you can find seasons 1 thru 5 on Amazon.<br />Besides being a good leader Jax is trying to be the best husband he can be and take care of his family, which in his line of business is not easy.  He is also rather good looking and sexy, which doesn't bother my eyes. smile!!!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I had watched the movie and enjoyed it so I had high hopes for the book... I was definitely not let down. Nicholas Sparks writes in an easy manner and you find yourself sucked into the story and always coming back.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love to play this game.  One thing is that it would be nice to be able to play the last numbers called before the board locks out. Other than that the game is fun.
B002SM2QDC|3.0|Some good effects and action sequences but overall lacking quite a bit. I like The Rock and he is what made this movie bearable for me otherwise it is about 4/10ths as good as the first one.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Mads Mikkelsen puts a sophisticated spin on Hannibal's character.  Great show for anyone interested in psychology - it portrays psychopaths spot on.  Highly recommend!!
B00CXQL828|5.0|If you enjoy straight up rock and roll get this. These guys are some of the finest on their respective instruments ever. Billy Sheehan delivers amazing bass and Mike Portnoy delivers straight forward kick ass percussion. Richie Kotzen finishes it off with awesome vocals and the best guitar work of his career. But this you will not be let down if you like just rocking out without the hype and the crap.
B005LAII62|4.0|This movie was a cute little movie and would recommend this as a family night movie. So pop the pop corn and enjoy the movie.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|I need to have parenthesis on a calculator.  There is just too much that can not be done without them.  This calculator is pretty useless.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie was one of the movies I had no want to see. I broke down and bought it and fell in love, it really hits emotions that a person can identify with. I rate this movie outstanding and challenge anyone not to watch it and not like it.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I'm a big fan of 5FDP and this album did not disappoint. The more i listen, the more i like it. Strong performance from an awesome band.
1593272200|5.0|I found this book to be very thorough, well-organized, and most importantly, easy to understand.  I bought it to be used as a reference but find myself reading entire chapters because it's interesting and makes sense.
0062082353|5.0|This is by far one of the best Navy Seal books I've read! I loved reading it every moment and it spoiled me as far as good military books go! It's a pure shame that we lost such a great american hero! RIP Chris Kyle!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Well acted, good twists. Beautiful sets and special effects. Paced well to develop suspense. Normally I am not a huge Tom Cruise guy, but he did not overact in this one.

Each of us long for that happily ever after....Every time i watch Emma, it gives the hope that each of has soulmate out there for us, sometimes that soulmate is closer than one can imagine.... It can be a good friend that we sometimes dont take the time to acknowledge....
B005FQ2H8W|5.0|They made a newer update to this movie, but die hards will love the first movie with these two actors.  They do not mention the Montague Project by name, but that is the base where the second experiment was conducted.  It follows the events that actually occurred.

0345535421|4.0|In \\"A Clash of Kings,\\" the second book in the \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" series, I really wish that Martin had given Daeny more to do than go around meeting people who either A. want her dragons, B. want to kill her, or C. both want to kill her and take her dragons. This pov, while it offered up some interesting tidbits such as the 'song of fire and ice,' got a bit monotonus. For the most part, other than Daeny's storyline, I really enjoyed \\"A Clash of Kings.\\"<br />Tyrian was certainly one of the most interesting pov's for me this book, further showing his struggle between his family and what he really wants (to be cared for), and his struggles trying to figure out who is working for who, and what their plans are. It also shows his growth as a character, while in \\"A Game of Thrones\\" Tyrian is a poor fighter, in \\"Clash\\" he has some success, and a true willingness to lead when it is needed, even if it puts him in danger. Tyrian also remains both one of the most sympathetic characters in the series, and one of the most amusing.<br />Arya's progression was also interesting for me, as she got shuffled from place to place, while continuing to hone her skills with the sword and as a leader in the making as she tries to get home.<br />I do not personally \\"like\\" Sansa, however, I was always curious to see what would happen during her pov chapters, especially when it came to her interaction with \\"The Hound\\" and Cersi. Martin also ended the book with Sansa being in an interesting position, which makes me eager for the next book to see what happens to her.<br />Jon's story did not feel like it progressed all that much until the very end, however, it too kept my interest. It was nice to have a pov that focuses on something other than the fighting that is going on between the families, and so many interesting tidbits are given out about what is beyond the wall, that to see what is going on up there is interesting, even if it could be sped up a bit.<br />I \\"like\\" Bran, and a fair amount happened to him throughout \\"Clash,\\" (mostly dealing with Theon Greyjoy) however, his chapters were not my favorite. Like with Daeny, I felt that they got a bit repetitive with what felt like a wolf dream every time (I know it wasn't, but it felt like it sometimes!). In truth, what interested me about Bran's chapters was usually Rickon. I am very curious to see who this unsocialized child grows up to be, especially since the wolves are a personification of their personalities, and Shaggydog is all but feral.<br />Catilyn's chapters gave a lot of information, and I am interested to see what happens to Robb, Stannis, Melisand, and others, however, Catilyn remains one of the characters I am least concerned with, and who I would not be all that sad to see go.<br />In all, I really enjoyed \\"A Clash of Kings,\\" and am very curious about seeing where the current storylines go, as well as all those tantalizing hints of things, however, there are a few parts that felt a bit repetitive, and which I hope to see progress faster in the next book.ount happened to him throughout \\"Clash,\\" (mostly dealing with Theon Greyjoy) however, his chapters were not my favorite.

0440416027|5.0|I was overwhelmed by how much I enjoyed this book! I started reading it, because I am interested in writing children's books and it had gotten rave reviews. But, I honestly can't remember the last time I enjoyed reading a children's book--or perhaps, really an adult book--so much.<br /><br />The prose has a lyrical quality to it and the story itself is written with the sort of eloquence that has become a rarity in children's books. Perhaps what I love most about the book, however, is the way in which it weaves together reality with the fantastical. It's rare to find a book that is at once so fantastical and yet somehow so believable.<br /><br />I also thought the author did a wonderful job of dealing with rather dark themes (i.e. the sick baby) with metaphors and spiritual imagery.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful read. I would recommend this book for adults who enjoy writing and/or reading quality children's lit as well as for mature young readers.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It brings all of the movie characters from all of the movies into one game. You can buy or earn things with ease..doesn't take forever to rejuvenate items. And it is a great way of entertainment no matter the age. Great graphics and sounds and music..I recommend everyone to try it. I admit it is one of the better build it games! And believe me I have played a lot of them! Come join the fun...if you need a neighbor look me up! I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

B00CU8OVIM|5.0|This should be a blue print to the new rap artist! It is hip hop at its definition. It reminds me a lot of jay z blue print. In this era of bad albums its great to have one that makes you think.
0439023521|5.0|I had no desire to read this book but a friend kept INSISTING that I should. Finally I decided to give it a try, and once I did I literally couldn't put the book down. A problem that I usually run in to with \\"young adult\\" books is that they can be rather immature, which makes the characters very hard to like/relate to. The Hunger Games did an excellent job of making the characters likable and realistic. There is tons of violence, action, corrupt government, manipulation, laughter, sadness, and anything else you could wish for in a book. Even if you're not a \\"reader\\" or don't really have any interest in this book, I would still give it a try. You might be surprised.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very enjoyable!  A game that makes you think and has no violence!  What a concept!  Great Fun for all!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it it is friggining awesome you will never get bored its worth the 7 bucks buy it worth it
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I downloaded the Angry Bird edition to my Kindle. My grandson, who is 4, loves Angry Birds! He was playing an earlier edition which I downloaded about a uear ago. This program allowed him to play the games, which were quite tricky. Over all it was a fun experience,
B00785P2QC|2.0|Game is fun, but Facebook for invest points not so much. You need them to do most everything and they are hard to get otherwise.
B00B9366VO|4.0|I'll admit I'm biased because I'm a Nirvana Fan. At that time there was nothing but junk coming out and along with saving Sound City they inspired many other bands, which I'm much more of a fan of than Nirvana. But as this film showed they put the digital age on hold for awhile and their is no substitute for talent.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I think everyone would agree that more coins would be preferred. It's a super fun game though. I play it all the time.
B003V9OCS8|4.0|My daughter & I watched this as a summer requirement for her German III class. The cinematography was well done & the subtitles were close. But if you are trying to read, translate and see the action at the same time it is difficult. The director did a wonderful job of showcasing the contrast between the struggling climbers and the affluence and indulgence of the spectators. Great movie based on a true story. Even my husband who hates subtitles got caught up in watching it half way through.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is quite enjoyable. Love watching the minions when I goof. My daughter also enjoys this game. The game does require petty quick reflexes.
B00068TJM6|5.0|This watch can do a bunch of fancy things. Just read the manual. But for now its pretty great at telling time :) Great price for a Seiko too!
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|Good movie. marine boot camp section esp good. excellent Nam section too. Seemed very real. Will watch it again .
B009KS4XRO|5.0|So much fun.  Collecting puzzle pieces, receiving rewards, and especially making friends all around the world. Love trading, sharing, and chatting with friends playing this game!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great addition to my game stash. Easy to use. This is fun to grab when I only have a few minutes to kill.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is an amazing app with some great World War II guns and the sound effects are dead on and the graphics are decent
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Things are running smoothly in the silo, with everyone having a job that contributes to the welfare of all...or does it? Beneath the everyday routine lies a rotten truth, and it all starts to unravel when a good man is sent to his death by being banished to the outside world to clean sensors coated with toxic dirt. Juliette, the main character, is a complex character with definite flaws but also competence, hard work and integrity so you find yourself caring about her.<br /><br />The book starts in what feels like the middle, so it takes a little while to understand what the silo is, why people are living there and how the society is structured, but once you get it, the story becomes fascinating. How did it all come to be, and who were these people who founded and set up the Order of the silo? What loyalty do their descendants owe them? It really makes you think about how people in leadership often keep citizens in the dark &#34;for their own good&#34; and also how people are sometimes too timid to speak up and assert their rights.<br /><br />There seems like a lot more story to tell. I'd love to see a sequel!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fabulous!! so much fun &amp; variety!! never get tired of this game..I hope they keep updating and adding more games..
B0050DZN4K|4.0|It gets the job done and i am glad that it was so easy to import my google reader content
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|I love  these movies (Ironman2)---any movie that Robert Downey Jr.  is in - I will buy--he is a great actor
B008CLI4N4|1.0|A friend at work recommended this series to me as \\"the best thing ever\\". I could barely get through the first episode. Boring, bad acting, cheap looking sets, costumes, and makeup. I'm glad I only wasted $2.99 on this.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|No glitches( so far).Pencil option. Clear readable numbers ( a must for sudoku). Pleasant graphics. (Please note I got this as the faotd, but I would gladly pay fot it.)
0894803123|5.0|I bought this book about a week ago after reading the reviews and just made my first batch (Heath Bar Crunch). I just put it in the freezer and can hardly wait to try it! I have a Krups 1 quart ice cream maker and have made several recipes including peach/mango. Now my question...after churning for 20 minutes, I started adding the Heath Bar pieces and the ice cream maker almost immediately stopped running (I had no proplem when adding peach & mango pieces). I had to add the rest of the pieces and manually fold them in. I look forward to trying many more of the recipes but am wonering if I will have problems with adding things such as oreo cookies etc.? Anyone have any thoughts or had the same problem with the recipes containing solid pieces? Just a side note... using raw eggs doesn't bother me, but for those concerned, try ones that are pateurized.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book, can't wait for the next one!! Then I will have to reread them all to get up to speed :P
B002S43V3Y|5.0|Harold and Maude has always been a family favorite! This is a perfect movie for someone who likes quirky, kind of dark &#34;romance, coming of age&#34; movies.
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|I bought this movie because it was filmed in 3D.  After watching it I thought it was a good movie.  I've watched it several times and still enjoy watching it.  Had some really good 3D effects.
B002KKCW04|4.0|The sandal fits well, the materials, and build quality seem top notch.  As an added benefit, the arch support seems well above the norm in terms of what I have experienced with similar products.
0385737955|5.0|Within the first chapter, I was unconvinced that I would like or even finish the read. I was not particularly fond of the &#34;vocabulary&#34; used. HOWEVER, the story line kept me reading... boy did I get sucked into this book!! I loved the concept, since everything today is basically the same, and this was very different! I've read its already been signed to become a movie, and I've very excited to watch it with my kids (depending the rating). If you liked the concept (not necessarily the actual read) of the Hunger Games, you'd like this book. If not, heck I bet you would still like it. Give it a try!
B007AL48UK|5.0|Fun, easy to use mahjong app with summer themed tiles.  A nice way to kill time during an especially boring meeting or presentation.
159413586X|3.0|I felt this book was alittle more dragged out. I found myself skimming paragraphs just to get to the point. I won't give anything away, but I did not like the ending. It ruined the whole trilogy for me. What I did appreciate was the fact I could find all the books in a large print. I do not have eye troubles, but it sure did help. I will not be a Hunger Games addict anymore.
0425263924|3.0|I love this series, but sadly this book didn't live up to my expectations. I was hoping that this book would be the last and Gideon would get his happy ending. Am I excited that the books will continue? Yes, and I will purchase every last one. But it is still a shock that there will be more than just one more.
0439023521|4.0|The book was a little fantastical and definitely geared toward young adults and teens but it was still a good book.  Far better than the movie in my opinion.  But that's usually how it goes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy to use! I use this app as much as I use the full website. Highly recommended for anyone who uses Pinterest.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but for me it wasn't one of those I can't put it down, I don't care if I only get 3 hours of sleep kind of books.
052118939X|5.0|Book arrived in brand new condition. This is the newest version of this grammar book and has a good print quality along with beautifull illustrations. CD that came with the book requires high tech PC or MAC in order to run smoothly. Highly recommended.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is addicting while you try to figure it out and wait for coins. But when you complete all puzzles and top out all prize tiers,  coins continue to accumulate and there is nowhere else to advance. Or I haven't figured out what to do,  since there are no clear directions.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Could not put my Kindle down. I was so into every word that the book just consumed me this book is a classic.
B0053O8AQE|4.0|This is a fairly comedic series, mainly due to Kat Dennings' sharp sarcasm, mixed in with a genuine ball-buster attitude and somewhat macabre sense of humour. The two girls play off each other's comic timing smoothly and the general cringe factor remains amusing without becoming disturbing. Good show so far.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is the same solitaire that you remember...<br />The control is smooth.  It still has the important components to make it solitaire.  Play and enjoy it.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|what to say about this book...hmm...I didn't really care for it at all. I'm giving it 2 stars because I finished it and read it whenever I had a chance because I wanted to \\"get it\\". I was hoping for some answers and in the end I realized it's just a fantasy and too supernatural for me. I got no answers, I just didn't get it. This was the first book I've read by Neil Gaiman and will probably be the last. I think mainly because he just doesn't write in the genre I typically read. I tried, and I was very interested at first. But it just got too weird with no point, in my opinion.
B00B4804KS|5.0|MAde even better with the extra boost of 3D! My wife just got me a 3D TV so of course I started cruising around Amazon to see what was available (Quite a bit actually) This was a very well done film and myself and the kids really enjoyed being able to watch in 3D
B00DJWV11I|4.0|4.5 stars! Ok...I'll be honest. When I was 15% into this book, I didn't care for it. I even thought a couple time I may not even finish the book. BUt I kept reading. Drew is a complete jackass-jerk. I really didn't like his attitude. Then the story became rather predictable. And at that point I was rolling my eyes. Another thing that bothered me early in the book was how the story is told like it's Drew talking to the reader. It bugged me in the beginning. But then the more I read, the less I noticed or cared about that. This story is all in Drew's POV. At 25%, I was really starting to enjoy the story. By the middle of the book, I was so hooked! So this just went to show me, a book that I didn't think was going to be that good in the beginning actually surprised me to be a rather great story. I enjoyed it!
140006922X|5.0|Great Book. I would recommend to all. The book goes into great detail and is written in way that one can understand.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|good YA novel about a girl who commits suicide and leaves cassette tapes for people to listen to as to why she did it. I liked the mystery of it and how layer by layer the story was unraveled. 3.5 stars
B00DHNJ80K|5.0|This was a great surprise of a movie.  It looked like another shoot-em-up big Hollywood movie, but it was so much more.  The two main characters have wounded souls and they start to find a glimmer of hope that is more desirable than their obsessions with revenge.  It is a wonderful movie with a great story and great acting, much more than a shoot-em-up movie.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Audio quality for a live CD is outstanding. It's fantastic to have a piece of history with this CD. My only disappointment is that this is a 2 disc set...and not a 3 or 4 disc set because they did so many other songs on tour!  I also wished they had done a more extensive inside book with all the tour dates, comments, more pictures, etc! Don't miss out on this CD! Thank you Brian, Alan, Mike, David, Bruce, the Band...and even Carl and Dennis...for the memories!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I never thought I'd  play such a great game.<br /><br />I did not like to stop playing my horse.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|I will fully admit that I am a huge Jason Mraz fan, so my review might be a tiny bit biased.  But that said, this was a great concert (I attended the show in Portland OR on this specific tour) and Mr. A-Z always puts on a good show.  Can't go wrong with this one!  Added bonus:  my kids love his music and enjoy putting this on as background music to pretend they were there too :)<br />Special added bonus: The Sunshine Song.  'Nuff said.
0345803485|1.0|Where do i begin! I purchased book because it had so many good reviews, but I didn't even finish 1/3 of the book! Its that bad. I dont know what is worst, the author's writing or the incredibly shallow/boring characters. I could not stand another one of the male's repetitive lines, \\" 'Stop biting your lip. You know what that does to me' \\" This book is garbage!!
B004X2M9VY|5.0|My grandson (age 10) and I have continued to watch the entire series starting with 2005. Neither of us cared for the early ones, but we love this later series. We are looking forward to season 7.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Now first I've got to declare that I watched the film before I read the book so naturally I'm judging the book by the movie which should be vice versa. I thought it was one of the rare instances where the film was better. Didn't like how Tiffaney didn't have the personality like she did in the movie or how the dad was just a terrible person all around as where in the movie he was everyone's favorite.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I have enjoyed watching Doctor Who with my grandson. We have been watching them in order. He is 10 years old and I was quite surprised when I first learned that he knew about Doctor Who.
0671027573|5.0|This is my second copy of this book because I love it so much and lent it to a friend.  Who never returned it!  So my advice, get this book and don't let it out of your sight!  It is funny, original, sad and scary - along with sexy and hot!  We all need a guy like Sam!
0140143505|4.0|This tiny book is a treasure. When you're reading it, you feel like you're taking a peek at people's lives, and you are! If you are a book lover, or if you are one of the few letter writers left on Earth, this book will appeal to you. The fact that Helene and Frank are people from another era makes it even more interesting. I learned something about the characteristics of life in post WWII America and England. This was a short, easy, worthwhile read, and the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish the book were longer.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|Not a lot to say - this is the necessary charger for the Plantronics Voyager Legend Bluetooth headset.  This was a good price to get a second/back-up cable to keep in my briefcase since you can't use a micro-USB cable to charge this headset.  It's good to have a back up and at this price it made it reasonable.
B006H5120E|5.0|The picture is perfect in this great film. Everyone should see Titanic in blue ray it is fantastic. A must see film for everybody.
B001O5114O|5.0|Great Western , it has a good plot and good actors. Great leading actors . That is all I have to say.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The one picture I would want to watch in blue ray. The film is much clearer in blue ray and The original film looks so much better.A must see picture on blue ray.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is such a fun game. You should play this game. Once you start playing it gets so much fun.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|I bought this bluray/dvd/digital download pack mainly because it said Digital Copy + UltraViolet on the front. But to my surprise this is only half the truth. You still have to go through the process of visiting the Universal page the same as you do when you redeem these digital copies for UltraViolet and then and only then will they also help you with the iTunes digital copy.<br />There is no digital disc or straight forward way to redeem your iTunes download like there used to be, especially if you live outside America like I do. Thank you Universal for once again blurring the lines between iTunes digital copy and UltraViolet.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|Though not the greatest movie ever made, it was a nice way to see the history of OZ prior to Dorothy arriving there. The special effects were colorful and entertaining. I'd recommend this for most families but would not suggest it for families with small children as the ending witch transformation is a bit intense for younger viewers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this great for on the go but I think the xbox version and as well as the pc version they have better gameplay and not this much lag
B00AALU8IS|4.0|The first movie is one or our families favorites. When this one came out we wanted to see it and were surprised that like most sequels, this one did not stink. Actually, though not the same wackiness of the first, this movie was very fun to watch. If you have watched the TV series at all, this movie actually becomes even more enjoyable. Some of the same fat panda jokes, but other than that, we love it.
B002XXLKHY|4.0|This is a funny movie and a great one to keep in the rotation of holiday classics. Will Ferrell is always good for some laughs and he doesn't disappoint in this movie either. Great movie that the whole family can watch.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|It was interesting and easy to read.  I liked the style of writing like we talk.  The funny stories made it better.
B002VISNAS|4.0|A fascinating review of how our subconscious influences our decisions without our knowledge. Highly recommend for anyone interested in the subconscious mind
B003G4W49C|5.0|It took me a couple of days to read it. I could not put it down. It took all of my imagination, twisted it around in ways I have never thought before, and surprised me at every turn. Entertainment at heart, emotionally entwined, discovered fantasies.
B000085RPU|1.0|The movie shipped from Belgium and wasn't formatted for any  dvd player in the US. Waste of money ant time waiting as this was a bday gift.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It's a fun game to play and i would recommend this game to everyone so please get this app thank you
B00CF34B2I|3.0|The game is great. I love the touch screen interface. When you choose how you want damage divided up if one of your attacking creatures is blocked by more than one creature is a little tricky. The multiplayer aspect of the game is terrible. It only works over Bluetooth so it isn't actually online play which sucks. That is why I have it three stars.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I love this game. As does my 4 year old. We enjoy challenging each other on harder levels.  I think the time travel element adds a lot of fun
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great alarm clock, love waking up to Chuck Mangione. Works well not hard to figure out. Don&quot;t have any bright numbers staring at me.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It is  a pretty alright games. Very easy and hard at the same time. I love it. Very Time consuming.
0547884591|3.0|Too busy.  I couldn't focus on one thing, there were so many topics on one page.  Some of the recipes looked good.
B000I2J2W2|5.0|This movie is considered by many aficionados of the genre to be among the top three science fiction movies ever. 1 - Metropolis, 2 - Forbidden Planet, 3 - 2001.<br /><br />Young people may not appreciate it because the special effects are not done with a computer or blue-screen but by older reliable methods. Oh yes, if you are a fan of Shakespeare as am I, think &#34;The Tempest&#34;.<br /><br />Not to forget, Robby the Robot and, one of the most important things Science Fiction gives us, a look into the human psyche  - our primitive brain, not just mammalian but reptilian as well...
030746363X|4.0|A diet for people who need to lose a lot of weight.  Good reading. It looks like a diet I can handle.  I am on day 2.  Lots and lots of tips and other items to help you become a better person.  A lot of pages though..
B00D23GXB2|5.0|I enjoyed this collection of poems & short writings. 'The Greatest Poet' alive lets us glimpse into his world, and as a man, I'd have to say that it's a world that rocks. Women are beautiful, sexy creatures, that us men can't get enough of. The sentiments of this collection of work sum up how I feel toward women, about wome; the lust and desire, the wanting, but not in a crude manner, it's just honestly done.<br />Women are hot, and so is this book.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|Susan Cain has done all introverts a great favor with this book. A must read for introverts and highly recommended for the extroverts who live and work with them.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love playing the game! It gives you something fun to do! It's also fun when your friends are playing too!
0061743526|5.0|Love having my own copy of the book .. I have reread it two times since receiving it .. I so much enjoy Harper Lee's writings .. &#34; To Kill a Mockingbird &#34; is one the best books ever written ..  I recommend purchasing your own ; especially if you are fan ..
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I like it as i like to find things on it that i cant find anywhere else. It makes things a lot easier
0783225857|5.0|One of favorite films of all time .. Gregory Peck is simply marvelous .. The DVD is wonderfully reproduced .. I recommend it highly .
B00AQA94M4|5.0|I purchased this cd for my husband and he loves it.. was very cheap but he was so excited so it made it worth it
B00BP29SAA|5.0|I downloaded this for my 4 year old grandson and he can't put it down. He loves taking care of the customers. He says they keep coming back so he must be doing a good job. haha  It teaches him responsibilities such as cleaning the floor,recycling,helping to shop,pricing things, stocking back room,and bringing in carts when needed. It is worth the down load for kids.
B00A4N9CC0|5.0|fun and easy watching after crazy days at work<br />I think I have 6 of them now & love them all :)
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app very amazing and I love it!! It keeps me updated so I know what's going on. It keeps me close to my friends and family when I'm away! So I have to say this app is awesome. I use it every day. So ignore the bad comments look at the good ones!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Very well written. The author has a talent for bringing to life the historical place and time.  When he chooses to bring his own interpretation of the New Testament is where I have some concerns.<br />Historically this is a must read.
B009AMANBA|5.0|My husband wanted to see this movie when it came out in the theatre but never did. I ordered it as a gift for him and it was very enjoyable at home. I would recommend it for anyone that enjoys Lincoln!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great production, story and acting, along with a storyline that is very unpredictable.  Wardrobes and lingo was very authentic. Highly entertaining.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|This is a very good movie for a couple that wants to watch something without foul language. Highly recommend it!!!!!
1451695195|5.0|Clearly indicates with a scientific temper that the life is not only what we live on earth but there is much more to it....
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was amazing. I was pulled in instantly.  There were times I actually had to book the book down a take a break because it was so intense.  When I was at work I found myself thinking about Jules..hoping she was going to be ok!  Thank you Mr Howley for an amazing journey!  Definitely heading over to goodreads to give this book 5 stars!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|What a great movie!!!!!  This movie is fun to watch and is top quality across the board.  Everyone involved hit a home-run with this!!  Thank-you!!!
0743270754|5.0|This book was even better than the &#34;hype&#34; surrounding it. Ms. Goowin is an excellent scholar, and she weaves her obvious extensive research into a book that is readable by lay persons.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|We hadn't seen Red and wanted to see it before we see Red 2.  We couldn't find the movie locally so we found the movie at Amazon.  It was delivered in a timely manor and in excellent condition.
0385528787|5.0|I've notice that of the four big-selling books by women I've read over the past few years, [[ASIN:1565125606 Water for Elephants: A Novel]], [[ASIN:015602943X The Time Traveler's Wife]], [[ASIN:0316176486 Life After Life: A Novel]], and this book, three of them have some sort of science fiction element. Although that's not unusual in science fiction, with authors like Ursula K. LeGuin and Connie Willis, in the novels I first mentioned have less of a \\"space cowboys\\" attitude, and more an attitude that \\"one major thing has changed and how does everyone react?\\"<br /><br />Margaret Atwood has gone a little further with this idea, although she presents a near future where a combination of unbridled capitalism and ecological ruin have completely changed the way we live. Gene mutation has given rise to a number of new species, and a plague has killed of the majority of humans. This leaves some of the humans living in a forest \\"fort,\\" making the occasional trip to the ruins of a big city to scour for supplies.<br /><br />The dozen or so humans are joined by the Crakers, a new version of humanity who have few of the faults of the originals. They're named for Crake, the brilliant but dead biochemist that made them live on a diet of Kudzu and be unable to fight. The Crakers are inquisitive, picking on every word that humans use and asking to know what it means. At one point they fixate on the meaning of the F-word - they eventually believe that it is a being that will help others. At other times they sing or hum.<br /><br />Narrating the story is Toby, one of the Gardeners, a sect that tried to preserve the Earth. She longs for her boyfriend, Jeb, who was a member of the MaddAddamites, a group of bio-terrorists who tried to stop the big corporations from ruining the Earth. She tells the Crakers about Jeb's past, including his brother, Adam, who formed the MaddAddamites before the plague.<br /><br />If you've read the two previous books in the series you'll be aware of much of the above. My wife, who reads everything that Atwood creates, says that you should read the two preceding books in the series. My view is that the \\"story so far\\" that Atwood provides before the main story was enough for me to get through this book. The book is not obsessed with plot in the big sense - although plenty happens, much depends on the interpersonal relationships.<br /><br />So both my wife and myself recommend this book. Atwood paints a convincing picture of post-apocalyptic life as characters dream of real coffee and dress in bedsheets. There is a cloud hanging over the fort in that there are Painballers, who are humans reduced to torturing other humans and then eating them. They live outside the fort but could invade at any time.<br /><br />The book has lots of humor, like Toby constantly having to tell the Crakers to \\"stop singing\\" before she can continue with her tale. There are a few gruesome details, and a small amount of action. In the end the humans have something of a brighter future.<br /><br />Get this book and read it. Atwood weaves the tale so well, you'll be drawn in to it. If there was another book following this in the series, I'd read it in an instant.the above.

Atwood weaves the tale so well, you'll be drawn in to it. If there was another book following this in the series, I'd read it in an instant.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|Sure, it was artistic.  That is the only compliment that I can spare for this film.  If it comes on television, why not?  I regret paying to see it and suggest that others save themselves the money or purchase something else.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have been playing this game for over a year and enjoy it as much today S I did when I first received it.  The game is fun and I always look forward to the free games each day.
B00DM0UTPQ|3.0|I disagree with the reviews that characterize the movie as boring. It is not boring. At the same time, it isn't really plausible, either - though that is not necessary to make an enjoyable movie. The acting in the first half of the movie is underwhelming, but things improve about half through the second act. There is a lot of overlap in the storyline with Crimson Tide. So, all in all, it's okay - not great, not terrible, just okay.

B004DL5K2K|5.0|Ozzy has been my favorite Heavy Metal singer for 25 years now. The first album I heard of his was this album. The &#34;Blizzard of Ozz,&#34; album. I got it on cassette tape. I finally got it on CD. I've been meaning to for quite some time now. The only difference is the 3 added songs, &#34;You looking at me looking at you,&#34; the non LP version, &#34;Goodbye to romance,&#34; the 2010 guitar and vocal mix, and RR.
B008JFUO36|5.0|A very good movie that you have to pay attention, it is a very confusing but entertaining movie, a must have

B007EECSFA|5.0|The Secret Keeper...kept me captive for the long haul.  What a wonderful read! The story interweaves history with a plot line both tender and dangerous.  It is about romantic love and maternal love. as well as obsession and revenge.  And then....a surprise ending you won't see coming.  This is a must read!

B001DF68MA|5.0|We installed the WeeRide with relative ease onto my husband's bike. He's 6'5 and his bike is very large, but we were able to get it on there with minimal problems. As soon as my son went for his first ride (around 13 mo), he was addicted! He loves going with his dad for bike rides now, and the WeeRide makes it so easy, safe and comfortable. He can see all that's going on in front of him and my husband feels he is very safe because he has both arms right next to him. My husband also says it doesn't affect his riding, and he'd rather have the weight in the middle of the bike instead of on the back which would throw off the balance. One of our best baby gear purchases!
B007P2DQJI|5.0|Product as described! Quick ship.  The battery seems to work well and the charger has a cool red or blue led depending on the charge.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Ordered, paid for it, downloaded and then...nothing.  Just the same message over and over again.  It doesn't work and I'm complaining to Amazon about it because a few people are in the same boat, and that isn't right.
B000WC3864|5.0|I've seen this movie a zillion times but this edition has a lot of interesting extras. I love hearing how the movie was made.
0440237688|4.0|I give this a 3.5<br /><br />So the book is beautifully written. You really get a feel for the strange society that Jonas lives in from his own POV. The characters, especially the Giver, are fantastic and leave you wanting more. The only problem is that you are wanting and NEEDing more. Way more - The book just sort of abruptly ends with SO MANY questions still lying in the readers mind. I'm not sure if Lowry just suddenly got bored with the story and left but I kept trying to turn the page and there was nothing.<br />What? That's it? That's where it ended? It seemed to end right at the climax of the story.
B008JFUNYG|4.0|This is a great stand alone movie. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I didn't love the original so much.
B000HKYNQ0|4.0|Great watching and remembering the good old days when shows like this were common.  I wish they would bring the Star Trek adventures back to TV.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|I chose 5 star because it is nice to come to amazon to search for this<br />then having to go all around town to find this<br />I recommed this for anyone.
193700788X|1.0|I borrowed this book from the local library, and had to wait 2 months before getting my hands on it due to the long waiting list. Needless to say, I could have probably passed up reading this book altogether. What a disappointment! I have to agree with other reviews about how this book has a \\"ghostwriter\\" feel about it. It just does not feel the same as the other books in the series. I was disappointed about the end of the book, but REALLY disappointed about the whole book in general. I honestly felt like Charlaine Harris just wanted to hurry up and be done with the series, so she basically threw a bunch of junk together and threw it out there. I'll buy the book just to round off my collection (only if it's cheap!), but probably will never pick this book up again. If you must insist on reading this book, do yourself a favor and don't buy it. Borrow it, rent it, whatever, just don't buy it (unless you can buy it used for really cheap). Don't waste your money!
B00177YA1K|5.0|I chose 5 star because it is nice to come to amazon to search for this<br />then having to go all around town to find this<br />I recommed this for anyone.

B004YW4L5K|5.0|I bought the audiobook version of the Tenth Anniversary Edition, and it was Full Cast; I must say it's one of my favorite purchases.
140006922X|5.0|I loved this book! Aslan based a lot of this book on prior work by a Jesuit Priest at Santa Clara, expanded, simplyfied, and created a wonderful, cohesive document.  Since I too was educated by Jesuits, I had been exposed to a great deal of this material already and found Aslan's writing consistant with what I had been taught and challenged with.  A word of warning, I said, \\"challenged with\\" in the prior sentence.  If you are a person that wants to base your faith on a story that Jesus was born in a manger, while in Bethlehem, with three wise men standing around bearing gifts from the East, because there was a census that Joseph and Mary had to travel to report for - you will not like this book.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I love this movie and the quality is always perfect with amazon instant video. So excited to own it! Thanks amazon for having it so early :)
1416955070|1.0|I was intrigued by the recent movie previews for City of Bones and picked up the Mortal Instruments series for Kindle on a lark. I thought it would satisfy that popcorn-summer-reading for the last few weekends at pools and seashores, along the same vein as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, or - most recently - The Hunger Games. Unfortunately, the contents of of City of Bones fail to match the fine coiffed cover model, or even the typography...<br /><br />Clarke switches gears from an action filled fight scene to a chapter wherein most characters sit passively in place while one provides an infodump of a monologue - for pages.<br /><br />Clarke has many named characters in the story. I give her credit for discovering a universe where everybody talks exactly alike regardless of age, sex, or demonic affiliation.<br /><br />While the book does attempt to use foreshadowing, the effect feels more like fore-spotlighting. Unlike Chekov's Gun, which famously decreed a set of pistols displayed over the mantle in act 1 must be fired by act 4, Clarke seems to prefer Petrov's Pie, which is where an author makes a cream pie appear in a character's hand out of thin air, and the character promptly throws it at someone.<br /><br />(Spoiler: the pie usually misses. It's okay though, the villains' vision is based on movement and when the main characters do not take any action, they are generally safest of all).<br /><br />Rating = 1 star because I did feel compelled to finish the story.<br /><br />Book 2's review will not share the same advantage.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|It's more depressing than funny...touches on sad stereotypes of marriage and getting older in life.  You end up more depressed than entertained in the movie...especially if you're older
B0090SI4OC|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  I though it was well done and it kept my interest though the entire film.
B005LAII4E|4.0|Much better than the first. Not so much C.G.I. just kick butt JOE. Enjoyed seeing old Joes brought back into the storyline.  My kind of movie!
B0057R5XRG|4.0|I am usually disappointed in sequels. I really enjoyed everything about this trilogy.  I think 1 and 3 are my favorites.  Two was a tad slow, but still I enjoyed it.
B007QUUJMG|4.0|it was a very good story and it was set out well and different to other books, I enjoyed the book a lot and it would be a good read for others too.

B007R21JJK|4.0|Just has a small quirk sometimes comes out of sleep mode after you put it in sleep mode don't know what causes this bug still a good board for the price.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Like the game but if you are a competitive person you can get flustered by the many bugs in this game. In the middle of a game you will just stop and then it state's check your connection, well I can see my router and there is no problem. Try to report good luck with that. You are just out the tokens for the game.<br /> Also don't spend money for game tokens then you will not get free ones. Only give free tokens when you get below 10 and will give you free scratch off every 45 minutes that you stay below 10.<br />Another issue is your weekly standing in game can abruptly change and not for the better, one week I had over 2600 points which is not a lot but next time I played it reset down to 196 this was almost at the end of their game weekly standing so......anyways like I stated before good luck reporting anything. They want operating systems info from my kindle and try getting that while filling in their numerous other questions. Did it twice never did hear back from them, will not waste my time again.

0670026557|5.0|American business is supposed to be a tough, ultra-competitive arena where only the strong survive, and nice guys get trampled, right? According to this book, that is not totally true.<br /><br />This book looks at three different kinds of people. Takers claim as much value for themselves as possible. If, for instance, they are the CEO, they are the sort of person who has a full page picture of themselves in the company's annual report, where most other CEO's will have a much smaller picture in their annual report. Takers are very deferential to superiors, and very mean and inconsiderate to subordinates. They use words like I, me and mine, as if they single-handedly caused their company to have a profitable year.<br /><br />Matchers aim to trade value evenly, as if they want to keep their spiritual inbox and outbox equal. Givers contribute to others without expecting anything in return.<br /><br />The giving could involve something like arranging a business introduction, or mentoring a younger employee. There is a fine line between being a giver and a doormat; a giver must also make sure that their business duties are not being ignored. In the short term, takers may do better than givers, but, in the long term, a giver's networking, collaboration and leadership skills will come to the forefront. A giver uses words like we, us and ours.<br /><br />How can a person increase their giving capacity? Take a test to see just how much of a giver you really are. Start a reciprocity ring at work. A group of employees meet weekly to make requests of each other. The intention is that everyone do what they can to fulfill those requests. It may seem a bit silly, but someone in your circle may know someone who knows someone who can fulfill your request. Publicly recognize givers at work. If you would rather give on your own, start a Personal Generosity Experiment.<br /><br />This is a very thought-provoking book, which shows that nice people can finish first. The average CEO, or division head, could do a lot worse than read this book, and start to implement its recommendations.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I loved it, the watch is very dependable, when I was in the Military we used watches like that, we worked in the rain, snow, ocean, dust and mud. I don't remember a reason why we didn't like them. This watches would give you date and time in combat and in peace. Yes ! I will recommend it to family and friends. I will purchase again because when I saw my father he liked it and he is wearing it now.
140006922X|5.0|This book will broaden your understanding of the historical facts used as foundation of the four gospels. If you have a religious or political agenda you will also find Aslan rethoric engaging.
0062255657|5.0|What a fantastically unexpected plot and cast of characters. This little novel feels lengthier than it is, and that is only a tiny part of its magic. If you liked American Gods, this is probably a great Gaiman choice for you. I loved this book!
B0027MJU00|5.0|At the beginning of this book, I had just finished reading \\"Gone Girl\\" and was left wanting more of Gillian Flynn's Dark mind, but I just didn't think I was going to be able to trudge thru the beginning sections. For some reason, I felt the book got off to a slow start! But, once I got into it, Flynn sucked me in and I was hooked. The plot is fantastic, the prose is amazingly vivid, the book is SO dark that I felt at times I was reading a horror novel rather than a mystery. It's a great book. A deliciously devilish read and I highly recommend it!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|If you like bingo you should like this. Lots of fun and countries to visit. Slots are pretty cool also.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The title says it all. The characters were all interesting and played vital parts in Europe's struggles during the time period. It was long but I never wanted to put it down.

B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I think this game is challenging  yet very fun. I like the creativeness of it. That is pretty much all I have to say about this game.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|just wish it was easier to go to my friends towns.  For some reason Cilestia is the only pony I can visit.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I think this is a perfect movie to watch after a divorce or breakup. The lesson is simple. Love is everywhere, but in love it isn't possible to posses a person. All one can do is to belong. If you don't want to belong to a girl, it means you are not actually in love. Despite a kind of happy end, it is a tragi-comedy with some relationships failing. I rooted for Laura Linney and Rodrigo Santoro, but their romance failed. Billy Bob Thornton as an evil President is a great comical injection of politics, he was totally brilliant in his little role. Emma Thompson is fantastic as usual. The best role Hugh Grant played after &#34;Four Weddings&#34;. I recommend it.

B00571F26Y|4.0|Having been Gluten Free since January this year (diagnosed with Celiac Disease), I have been doing a lot of reading on the subject and this book caught my eye. The title may lead you to think this is mostly about wheat and how it effects belly fat. That is definitely part of the message but there is so much more to this. The inflammatory effects of wheat on your joints, brain and overall body is very real. Whether you are gluten sensitive or not doesn't really matter. Some parts of the message come across as somewhat extreme. It is a very good read though that will provide you with lots of useful information about your body and our food supply.
0307887448|5.0|The story was a bit stretched at times, but the reality is; I just didn't care.  The imagery was so real I could see it all happening and almost wishing I was there.  Made my wife read it, she loved it, mother-in-law loved it.  I was questioning if I'd catch all of the 80's references (born early 80's) but I did.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun story that will just take you away for a short time as you read through it.  For that alone, it was worth it.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|Mr. Sledge`s complete honesty and humble manner of telling his story is unbelievably impressive. His courage is incredible, as well as his utter lack of ego. This book is very easy to read and a story that needs to be told.
0553296981|5.0|The diary of Anne Frank is a work that captured my heart.  The wit, honesty and wisdom of this young lady are remarkable.  Her bravery is awe inspiring.  If you have never had the pleasure of reading this book, do yourself a favor and take this enriching journey today.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Gillian Flynn is a talented writer and this book is entertaining, but terribly predictable.  I think Flynn had more success with &#34;Gone Girl.&#34;  But, I enjoyed this read, even if I wasn't terribly surprised.
076115678X|5.0|I have naturally curly hair and as all with naturally curly hair know it can be difficult to tame, especially at the beach or during high humidity . . . high school cheer pictures taken in the summer at the beach, yikes!  This book tells all the secrets to help keep your natural curls looking their best.  It is easy to read, lots of testimonials, simple to do & the results are fabulous.  (I am in no way related to the author)  This system even works on my 13 year old son who's hair just turned curly, really curly.  I highly recommend this book!

B0001GL3K4|5.0|Works very well.  I had to have it on DVD.  I am glad to view the movie again after wuite a while.
B00DC3DGSK|4.0|I heard this before I bought it, An from what I could tell, I liked it almost as much as Living Proof. Proof was the 1st album I've liked by Buddy in some time(he can be up an down). Answering the critics here, I do agree that the lyrics are weak (so are a couple of the duets)  on some of these songs, but the guitar work more than makes up for it. If you don't have Living Proof, buy it first - much stronger songs, but still, the guitar work is excellent on both. These 2 studio albums are probably the best work Buddy has done back to back. I think he is getting better, an even more confident with age, but he does need to pay more attention to the songs he chooses. I know there is still a lot of great tracks you could still cover, Buddy. If you want to check out his earlier stuff, as some have mentioned - Get The Complete Chess Studio Recordings 2CD set, an Damn Right I've got the Blues! Both highly recommended. Won't make a case study of the cd's, as others have already done that - just listen an enjoy!  If there is a better blues album than this for the year, I'd love to here it-taking recommendations now- let me know(lol). Long live Howlin' Wolf!!!!!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I had it downloaded to my mini Ipad and  couldn't put it down,  stayed up till all hours reading  and anytime or anywhere I had a spare minute.

0316247545|5.0|If you want details about just about everything and everyone (everypony?) from the first three seasons of Friendship is Magic, look no further than this book. It's got interviews, character profiles, song lyrics, episode summaries, and more. Very thorough, very well-organized.

159413586X|5.0|This book came as described and in a timely matter....I absolutely adore this series.  Definitely one of the better books out as of lately.  Wish there were more to this series!
B00DPY95D6|2.0|From the beginning this was confusing.  Would be a whole page with several people talking and there was no divisions to see who was talking.  The main character started out just fine but degraded herself with her actions.  And the story didn't end, it just stopped leaving the reader in mid air with no conclusion.
0345803507|2.0|Although the product came on time and as described, this series is quite a disappointment.  From everyone's raves, I expected a more exciting story line.  I was disappointed to say the least.
B005P4PAVK|3.0|I have high speed internet but the amazon sit was not able to support the streaming I don't have the problem with my Netflix account and both run off my PS3 so I think that it has to be the amazon site since netflix has no streaming issues

B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Can't wait to hear more from Lorde. They've combined great cover art with lush vocals and danceable beats- always a winning combination for me.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I was surprised how well the film was.  The action mixed with the story content kept me watching the movie.<br /><br />Carl
B003L77G2Y|5.0|If you saw the first two season and you like them. It gets even better. I will not continue because I will instantaneous combust.....LOL!!!
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|was a very goid movie. the ending will get u. a muat see lover and family film. the actress looks way better in this film than footloose
B0018TLRTK|2.0|Who the hell deemed Mony Mony as \\"live?\\" It's NOT! It's just the same studio version as every other source. Since this is the tune I purchased the CD for, f___ the punk who made the designation. He's a liar!
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Or perhaps I think that because 'Snow Crash' was the previous book I read. Here are six more words, ok?
B004PLT3TY|2.0|This was awful.  I knew it wasn't going to be great, it's a kid show... thus the second star instead of just one.  I'm not a kid, they might enjoy it much better, but I thought, &#34;Hey, it's endorsed by Disney, how bad could it possibly be... Answer: B-A-D.  If you're an adult and your child or the child you're babysitting wants to watch... better just do yourself a favor and grab a magazine/book/kindle/something ... ANYTHING.  This movie is gonna drop your IQ like a cement block in the Hudson river... in fact that would be probably be preferable to watching it again...<br />The sad thing is, it COULD have been a decent movie with better funding, a MUCH better script, better actors, and better effects... unfortunately they didn't even try, very little effort went into this movie.  Someone wrote something, and Disney slapped it's name on it in order to make a few quick bucks... the end.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Very fast action.  You have to find three or more adjacent, colored blocks to score and click them off as quickly as possible.  I use a stylus with this game and tend to panic a little when time is running out and just start poking.  Fun and fast.  There are social aspects to the game that I don't participate in, but for you butterflies, you can post your scores and play against your friends scores.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Surprisingly well done. I honestly wasn't expecting much and set low expectations when my wife wanted to watch The host. I'm not a fan of the Twilight Series and avoided this movie for quite a while because I admittedly wrote it off as more of the same when I saw it was based off a book of the same author... and admittedly the movie started out as I expected it would.  It didn't stay that way for very long though and things started taking a very different direction.  Although the voice-over (you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there) is seemingly a 14yr old, immature brat, don't worry, that mentality thankfully only lasts about 15min of the movie.  Beyond that point, I found the movie to be thought provoking and entertaining and even well thought out.  Overall, the movie was a welcomed surprise, and the lows of this film weren't enough to detract from my 5-star rating (maybe a 4&3/4).  Anywho, if you enjoy Sci-Fi, I'm confident you'll enjoy the movie and recommend you give it a chance.  After watching it I ordered the Blu-Ray for my home-Collection. Go into it expecting Twilight, come out pleasantly surprised. :D
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Amazing story!!!  Read it easily in my first two days of vacation! Highly recommended. Love, love, love!!! Great story and great narrative!!!!!!
1451696191|5.0|If you liked the movie or even if you didn't, you should definitely read the book. It is a different, more emotional experience.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I loved this book! The struggle between survival and the guilt she feels for the lives she must take to survive is riveting. This novel takes a good look at the price of survival in a world where the population fears the power the protagonist was born with. Never put it down!
0062073486|2.0|Difficult to get through. The author's writing style kept me from really getting into the book, although the story was interesting.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was  a nice and quick little romance book. I enjoyed it enough to finish it in a few hours. Definitely sexy if that is what you are looking for.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Loved this game on flash on my pc. Bought it for Kindle, extras make it really worthwhile. Great gameplay, great controls, all round brilliant.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|The girls in this family became so close to me, it was as if I were reading about my own family. I felt so connected to their struggles and their triumphs. This book brought me joy and tears. Jo maybe my favorite character of the entire genre.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Only my second album I have of thiers and I went out on a limb because I only had 3 songs that I really though were killer from American Capitalist. This album on the other hand is solid all the way through...Rob Halford does great things on the opening track. This is going to make me want to get prior albums from this band.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was my favorite book when I was a girl. The tale of healing in a protected garden is lovely. As the people in this story become a family, they heal their physical pains, and put to rest their inner turmoil brought on terrible trauma. Loved it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am enjoying this very much. I am through level two and I am<br /> looking forward to wherever is ahead.
1594744769|5.0|This book was amazing!  I was hooked from beginning to end.  It keeps you wondering what will happen next!  I can't wait to read more from Ransom Riggs!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This game is fun yet simple. It is also addictive. It would be nice though if you didn't have to read everything.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|This app is good. I found it at first quick but after a few uses it slows down. Another thing i dont like is that it doesnt bring u to other suggested videos like youtube does so sometimes i am looking for something and i cant find it because it doesnt pop up in the video suggestions. Other wise i have more complaints.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|A little more violence than in some of the other books, but the story line kept you guessing.  Many twists and turns, but kind of a sad ending.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It's fun but aim is off since you have to pull back to shoot the ball. Other than that it`s fun. Always room for improvement.
0763644765|5.0|This book has much less words per page, which is great for my 15 month old son. We are just starting to introduce the idea of potty training. The bright colors and large, simple pictures are wonderful. Many other books are for older children, in my opinion. My son immediately started to imitate what the 'baby' is doing. The book also has a dog and a cat in it. (we have both types of pets) Loved it!! So glad we decided on this book!!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Khaled Hosseine's skill is crafting characters with whom you can empathise.  As good a &#34;A thousand Splended Suns&#34; and &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;
074356619X|5.0|I overlooked rating this product, and maybe no one will see this anymore.  I was aware of the Law of Attraction long before The Secret came out, but what I really like about the DVD and CDs is the fact that it's brought to the masses and in a high-quality way with great speakers, all of whom I have heard previously, AND it does it in a way that gives great soundbites to remember..  The one thing that's a little of a downer is that The Secret doesn't go far enough.  It's worth it, but I urge anyone buying this who has not had a background in LOA to explore further.  It's not about 'wishing' something into existance.  Your Wish Is Your Command is another set of CDs....not done like these, as they have one speaker, but he gets into more meat...not for those not serious about changing their lives.  Get The Secret for the background and look/sound, and to acquaint yourself with speakers out there, but then graduate to product like YWIYC.
B001I975AU|5.0|love this movie it's got great actors.. there facial expressions make the lines they are speaking.. best movie ever. thank you
B00785P2QC|4.0|Pretty fun way to pass the time and very hard to walk away from. Worth the price for sure. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes simulation games. Very entertaining!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is the best ever hope u like it cause I do I like animals so it's really fun helping animals being back in their habitats
B000E6EGXM|5.0|I've always loved this requiem and this recorded version in particular. Was so glad to have purchased it again. Bravo.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|a good change of pace for 3 year old that likes minecraft. Helps develop manual dexterity during time allowed on Kindle.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|A classic film deserves to be view in Blu-ray quality but for a fair price. Thank you Amazon!<br />Until me meet again,<br /><br />L
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I felt anger and joy all in different parts of this movie. Jim Carrey was his funny character but with lots of depth overall.<br />I absolutely loved the lessons in the movie about being afraid to break the limitations set on us! Very insightful! Really a great movie.
1401923127|5.0|This is going to short and to the point. Buy this book if you want to improve the way you are living and want to know where we are headed. I loved it so much I'm going to recommend it as good reading for each of my adult children. Enough said.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This series has it down.  Drama, romance, intrigue and politics. The characters are believable with outstanding performances by the entire cast.  Well worth your time.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great for  vacation and all trips .you can view  well  at  night.<br />You can do your reading  and  look at any movie
0761172726|5.0|The perfect size and design to keep track of the calendars for several family members. That is essential with my family so we don't over schedule. I buy this calendar every year now and have never seen one more useful. The price is right too. High quality, thicker glossy paper stock holds up well throughout the year.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Such a fun and addictive game I love it it is fantastic<br />Really good but the boards and characters cost so much
B009JBZH54|5.0|Very high quality recordings. Beautifully boxed. One of the greatest super hero sets to be released. I never hesitate to pull one out, insert it in the Oppo and watch as other wonder.
B009LGO88E|5.0|From what i've read the circle pad only really is necessary for about eight games but boy is it worth it. I bought this specifically to fix the finicky controls in monster hunter and it sure does that. The extra size isn't that much of an issue when the grip helps keep your hands from cramping after hours of gaming, and it still fits in my case (original ds case). All in all its a great product and it came three days early. 5/5 would buy again in a heartbeat!
B00BC5I6Q2|3.0|and totally unlikeable and I found it hard to root for his character in the same way I would Tony Soprano, Walter White or Patty Hewes. The show is somewhat boring as well. I much preferred Kelsey Grammer's Boss.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game for the kids and its even fun for dad! Ive always thought that the minions were the best part of these movies!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Bought this from Best Buy primarily to use with iPad and iPod, knowing that the app(s) for them are not out yet and that I might have a little wait. However, I thought I'd set it up on my Windows laptop to check it out. Despite the Google site info indicating that Chromecast works as long as you have the Chrome browser installed, it apparently does not work with WinXP, browser or not. First, I get the LARGE note on screen that \\"we suggest you not use this device.\\" No reason, just don't use this device. Took a little looking on the Google pages to see that they really want Win7 or higher. Google needs to make this clearer in their literature. Same thing with the iPad; Chrome is installed, but Chromecast just won't work with the iPad.<br /><br />I'll update this once the iPad app is out and I can set it up.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. I haven't got addicted to it yet. Although I'm sure I will. The graphics in this game are done fairly well.
1423136802|5.0|Though the books were a quick read for me I enjoyed them quite a bit.  Especially the last two were absolute page turners.  I liked them so much I am going to look into reading Rick Riordan's next series!
B005XY67WI|5.0|I have been in some of her concerts and watched all of the DVDs, and I can say En Vivo Desde Par&iacute;s is the best. The setlist is incredible and it has different rhythms and sounds: from powerful balladas to incredible pop to catchy merengue.<br /><br />Her show is great: music, dancing, lights,... everything. Just to mention, Metallica's Nothing Else Matter cover is awesome with this new latin vibe.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|along with a great supporting cast. This show is not to be missed. Only hope it doesn't totally reflect the real situation in DC politics.
140006922X|3.0|One of the obvious problems with trying to present an historical book about the life and times of Jesus is that, although we may know much about the \\"times\\" he lived in and how that might have effected him, we only have a small amount of references about the man himself - and most of that is from devoted followers who, according to Aslan, may have had an agenda in mind when they wrote their own versions of what happened.  And as such, he questions the validity of some of the \\"historical\\" events that were said to have taken place.  Although we can never know what really happened, Aslan does present some interesting arguments, mostly based on an historian's perspective, about what might have occured. While some of the complaints about this book have been that Aslan doesn't bring anything new about the life of Jesus to the table, he does offer the reader a revealing glimpse into the world of the first century.  I should warn those who are true \\"believers\\" that (you can imagine) much of what is written about Jesus Christ is being questioned in the book.  Some recorded events, for example, are questioned based on the likelihood that they don't fit into the normal practices or themes of the time.  All in all, it's an interesting read for those who approach the subject with an open mind. Although well written, the main reason I didn't give it more stars was that, in the end, Aslan's ideas remain conjecture.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This was a fantastic end to a wonderful story.  I loved all of the story and was never bored.  It kept my interest from the beginning all the way through.
B00EFNXPFK|4.0|I'm a huge John Mayer fan, but this sounds an awful lot like born and raised. I like most of the songs, but it get's kind of boring. It's great background music for work though. I like Frank Ocean as a guest singer, but Katy Perry is a little bit to dramatic with her guest vocals. Call me the breeze is great too. It is a great version and I think JJ Cale would be proud. I don't think the magic of his first few albums is gonna happen again.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Simply could not put this book down! Amazing. Took me a little bit to connect the storyline but after I did it was a very smooth read.
159463176X|5.0|I loved this book.  This was the third book our book club read from the wonderful author &#34;Khaled Hosseini&#34; .  I have learned so much from reading these books.  great reads.
B007AL48UK|5.0|This is a great game really easy to see symbols and make your match. I've played many others where you have to pay close attention to the symbols. This allows you to make faster time and has a lot of new layouts to choose from. DON'T  PASS THIS GAME UP YOU WILL TRULY ENJOY EVEN IF YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED BEFORE.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I love all Mahjong games! They are the best! I have lots of 24 7 games and play them all the time. Love the pics.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|The love between Abby and Travis is easy to find enchanting. McGuire brings in the reader and makes you feel as if overwhelming love is possible. Looking forward to the next installment of the series.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is very fun and a good time killer.  I like how it is multiplayer. The only problem i have is i dont understand the energy. Does it regenerate  or do you have to get more wind farms?
B000FC1GJW|5.0|This book really captures you and makes you think, it really is an outstanding read. I feel this book has something for everyone to enjoy, I highly recommend it
0440133688|5.0|This is a great book. Simply a classic. A must read for all medical students and residents. I was told you should read it before medical school, before residency, then before your first attending job. You'll view it completely different each time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|yes this is the best temple run like game ever i like you can be the singer minion in despicable me two.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Now with the 'slide by' ads, this game sticks. Hate the commercials. Will delete right away if ads stay. Game is fun, but not worth the ads.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Argo is a great movie and takes you back to that turbulent time in US history.  The ending was a little bit too much Hollywood creative license taking.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott is a genius. This book is so well written and the multiple, never ending plot twists were mind blowing!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love the game it's very addictive but fun to play as well even meeting new friends.so join the fun and start playing
B00634GHJA|1.0|Awful.  I got my pics from phone to pc, but you cannot do anything with pictures like delete, move etc.  Also had on and off trouble getting the pc to find the phones pictures.  I never did get pics to go to phone.  Caused run time errors with Internet explorer.
B000PMG16U|3.0|The set is exactly what I wanted; however, the 3rd espisode (disc) kept sticking and freezing. The other two worked perfectly.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This is a 5 star product. I would recommend this to anyone who likes minecraft and Legos. It's an awesome package!
B00005NKK8|5.0|I have the movie, now I can enjoy the music behind the movie. I love this music and I love the collection. It is a great CD collection at a great price.
B008602KQI|3.0|Read the book first and missed the details that it contained. Relationships were skimmed over that added depth to the characters.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Really enjoyed this. A cut above the usual Reacher fayre. Thios book kept me up at night wondering what was going to happen next. Highly enjoyable. A great read.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Love the movie, a little slow but great plot and love both the main characters....  Would definitely watch again multiple times.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|I wanted to purchase this DVD for years and it was very expensive. Thank you for such a great price and nicely packaged. It came very fast too. I will most certainly purchase from this buyer again!! I give them a 100%! THANK YOU!
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|Wish there was more action but still an okay flick.  Not Tom Cruise's best movie, the end was too quick.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I brought this because of the reviews, they are right on the mark...I love this game.<br />Once you get started it's hard to stop.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was so excited to hear JK Rowling had a book out after the Harry Potter books - I loved the whole series (although I think JK got a little lazy in the middle of the 7th, I mean really... how long can they wander around not knowing what they were looking for?) but.... casual vacancy was the most boring book I ever forced myself to read. I don't mind dark, I don't even mind a little depressing if the story piques my interest, but this book was a hellacious waste of my valuable time. I give it 0 stars... we KNOW she can do way better than this piece of trash!
6304711905|5.0|I LOVE this movie! Great western and very historically accurate!! I recommend everyone watch this movie especially if you love the story of Wyatt Earp!
B005SAP45I|3.0|Too heavy for younger kids. I thought the targeted audience was younger audience apparently I was wrong. Worth watching if you have a 10+ years or older kid
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It does work very well, it makes it so much easier when playing games etc.also protects the screen when not in use.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The best bingo game on kindle it's addictive and challenging it's the candy crush of bingo, super smashing great xx
B004XDYJRU|3.0|I use this app a lot. I've been using it for years, and it works great being able to listen to the radio all day long. Since the new update it will no longer shut down after exiting.  Now it  will force close a lot on my Galaxy Nexus. and it constantly loses the stream. I haven't had these problems in a long time.  Since the new update it happens everytime I open it. Please fix these problems quickly. I will find a new app rather than going to my phone every 5 minutes and having a mess with it.
B00BJ7G1VK|4.0|This book is so user friendly regarding the recipes. I love the concept of being able to make French food no matter what kind of kitchen or level of cooking experience you have. Can't wait to see what she comes up with next.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A definite read for those who like fantasy, a awesome sequel to a game of thrones now on to the third book
B00B9366VO|5.0|Done extremely well.  Hard not to be jealous of Dave grohl.  Dave and a cast of other famous musicians tell the incredible story of the studio and the people that worked there.  It tells the history of the nieve eq board, and music technology in general.  Then at the end he plays rock and roll with a bunch of the people he interviewed.  I've watched it twice, I'll probably watch it more.
B00479SVBU|4.0|The product was just as described and reviewed, blew the competing product by Belkin out of the water regarding clarity and lack of static. Sturdy unit (as of a month into use). Slight noticeable static, does not transmit music as clearly as CDs, but quality of sound is still 80-90% there and not outstanding to unaware listeners. Good product, good price.
B00271B752|4.0|Pacino is amazing in this.  It was almost comical seeing his wardrobe changing over time.  He started out as a new cop out of the academy then progresses through his time working undercover.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The kids really love this. They like being able to build their own little worlds. Seems to be a very popular game.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I own all of their albums and just seen them in concert for the first time, I LOVE QOTSA! I love this cd
B00770KR7W|5.0|Halo 4's Master Chief. Great detail and articulation. Well worth the money for all the fine detail and such. I use this as reference for my Master Chief costume. See you at Comic Con!
B004XISI4A|5.0|I cannot wait for the sixth book to come out. I am sure that John Snow is not dead and that he will pull through
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I highly recommend this story to everyone but especially to all my like minded sci-fi fantasy music RPG computer game  comic book loving grew up in the 80s friends. It never got dull. I devoured every page.  And add in the fact there are a few good life lessons.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|I could not get enough of these books. I haven't read for years and years and this got me going again
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's a really good book with a lot of tension in it. It's impossible to stop reading it once you started!
006074748X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this after many years since first reading it.  I'm usually remember books I read in the past with regard to plots and twists, etc., but for some reason this surprised me.  I had a different ending in mind.  That was great because it was more like reading it for the first time instead of the third or fourth which is probably what I initially did.
1401938906|5.0|I didn't realy have to many expectations for this book ,I was just going to be a fun read.<br />I love it! It  works.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I watched the original episode IV back in 1977 in the theatre and was \\"hooked\\" instantly.  Since then I have owned every version of the films (except for the 3D versions, which I believe hasn't been released yet) and can't wait till the next trilogy hits the theatres in 2015.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|Of all the comic book heroes Superman was always my favorite. Personally I never had a problem with the Red Underwear on the outside of his costume and never really thought much about it. However I guess we all have our issues and I can't begrudge someone for that.<br /><br />Christoper Reeve's Superman although a bit long and dated these days will always be my the bench mark for Superman movies.  Brandon Routh in Superman Returns made a good effort and it was an entertaining film with nicely update special effects.  However he was basically playing Christopher Reeve playing Superman. Again good effort, but alas it may have sunk his career by playing it that way.  Now then flip forward a few years and we now have Man of Steel and Henry Cavil puts on the red cape. This time we have the badly needed reboot of the man with an S on his chest.<br /><br />Overall the movie is pretty good, and all the actors and actresses played their parts terrifically. The chemistry between Mr Cavil and Ms Adams is very good and is a credit to them that they could play their parts so well. The special effects although extreme where believable and worked when needed.<br /><br />My issues with this movie concern the climatic battle in Metropolis.  Am I the only that remembers all those 1000s of people who died in New York on 9/11? When you destroy a building in a major city people WILL DIE by the hundreds if not thousands.  If you destroy several large buildings 1000s more will die. Although the special effects where terrific, the battle went on far too long in my opinion. Rather they should have maybe started in Smallville, moved to Metropolis and then taken it into outer space.<br /><br />Another thing I found slightly annoying was the lack of legacy parts.  In the Christopher Reeve movies they always featured interesting Cameo Appearances by the past actors in bit parts.  They even did this with Superman Returns and it would have been welcomed in this movie.  How about giving the role of the Priest Clark Kent talks to someone like Jack Larson (the original George Reeves Jimmy Olsen)? The role of the Waitress in a Canadian truck stop to Margot Kidder (Ironically this would have been perfect for her, because she is from that region), Perhaps given the role of an elderly dinner in Smallville to Noel Neal. The tough guy trucker who's swings at Clark and comes out only to find his rig mangled; what a perfect part that would have been for Dean Cain. Superman is and was the ultimate superhero; even Marvel's Stan Lee once said in an interview \\"none of his creations are anywhere near what Superman is, and anything he tried to create the resembled him would have been a cheap knock off.\\" That's pretty high praise from a rival. There was all sorts of bit parts that could have been filled by these actors and actresses from \\"Superman's Past\\".  I appreciate, and fully agree that Superman desperately needed a reboot, but the director should not forget where it came from either.
B0078XGEK2|4.0|Peck encourages readers to embrace the the difficulties of personal and relational lough and to understand pain as a sign of one's maturation.
B001IYCMNA|2.0|I've had 2 of these products for about 9 months now.  When they work, they work great.  The problem is, they typically don't work at all for more than a few hours.<br /><br />he units will work flawlessly for hours (and on rare occasion days on end), then one or both of them will drop.  They require a reboot to start working again, and may work for minutes or hours again.<br /><br />We've RMA'd the device back to Cisco, as this is evidently a known issue, and were given two new devices.<br /><br />We've deployed the new ones and are running into the same issues again.  In some cases, the unit simply reboots itself (dropping everyone and everything connected to it) and in other cases they just lock up (error logs sometimes complain of a &#34;stuck beacon&#34;) and require a reboot.<br /><br />There are several forums online complaining about the same issues, we've tried every suggestion that they throw out, yet nothing has fixed these devices.<br /><br />Unless you don't mind bouncing your access point just about on a daily basis, stay clear of this thing.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Some of the puzzles are super easy, but some of the others really take some out of the box thinking!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was very happy to get my favorite film ever in Blu-Ray at a reasonable price.  The condition and set received was in excellent conditions and the time to have it in my house was very fast.  Thank  you!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Lots of fun and it challenges ur thinking skills. Bought for my daughter and we both ended up playing and having fun taking turns
B0019IB26I|5.0|This is a great album and the fact that it is live makes it even better because you can hear the audience participate.  The guitar solos are long and melodic.  The disk features many of his greatest hits and are done in such a way that they seem to be more captivating than when released as singles.  A great BUY.....I was surprised to see that this was a 2 disk item and that was a real pleasant surprise!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Quite happy with this car charger.<br /><br />It seems sturdily built and it provides a positive charge to my Samsung Galaxy S3, even while using GPS enabled apps like Maps and Ingress. My old charger would just maintain my battery's level while using GPS apps.<br /><br />The only thing that annoyed me while ordering was that the black version of this product was not available with Free Super Saver Shipping. Otherwise, I'm very happy with this and will certainly look to Anker products in the future.
B000002KDX|5.0|I was an America fan back in the '70's and came across this CD.  It was a great buy and after listening to the samples it brought me back to the time when these songs were popular.  I love this CD and highly recommend it to anyone who thought America was unique in the way they put together their voices and words.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Game took an hour to load, then always trying to get you make in game purchases for more coins or some crap. Horrible concept, and just trying to get money out of you.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|I love Evanescence.  Some interesting tracks, some remind me of last album.  But still it's Evanescence and Amy Lee still rocks it.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|It was a very interesting and enjoyable story<br />Very much abuse<br />GOOD thing she escaped from IT<br />Founded a better life
B003G4W49C|5.0|I like  it a lot very interesting can't wait to see what the movies gonna be like.....but very good read
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This is one of the best games I've played in a long time.  The only time I put it down is when my battery gets low and I have to recharge.  I rush home from work to play until late at night. Looking forward to seeing more of these kind of games.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|I got this package for my boyfriend for xmas and i know he is going to love it...it has so much in it..thank you..omg at a great price!!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I can't wait to get free time and take care of my dragons everyday. It's great for all ages. The only downside is not enough ways to get gems. But the good thing is u can still play.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I really like the design of the Pulse and it was easily integrated with my other Withings products (better scale ever used). I was really attracted by the features coming up with the Pulse. First the pedometer works fine and it seems fairly accurate. On the other hand, Pulse seems to have trouble detecting when I'm running or walking but not always. I also really enjoy the altimeter since I usually run on hills and mountains. What is the coolest feature on the Pulse is the sleep monitor. This feature works perfectly fine for me. I have young babies and kids and it perfectly detects when I awake and how long I stay awaken.<br /><br />This biggest issue I had with the Pulse was the battery. This first device I got cannot last longer than a day and was sometime shutting down at night. It became useless. Fortunately, Withings has an awesome customer service. They replace the Pulse really fast at no cost. My second device almost meet the specs (2 weeks of battery life).<br /><br />Special thanks to Mathieu of the customer support.
B009LDD54K|5.0|Such a good show. I was so excited for this to arrive! My husband and I started watching the night we got it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you'd love it I hope you'd enjoy this app if you like the movie so if you get this app think did I like the movie
B002L5AST0|5.0|The best movie that I have seen in many years. The plight of the street children in Brazil is made very clear. It also shows the enormous human and geographical diversity of the country.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I can't get enough of this show since being able to watch the first two seasons on Amazon Prime. The witty banter between the cast and constant no-win-won situations keeps me coming back episode after episode. My husband and I have been looking for a new show to get into and this is it!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you want a bible app but aren't sure which one to get, then this might be the right one for you.  Why? This app has many different versions and many are free.  The only thing that I don't like about the app is that you have to have a email account and be signed into it in order to access some of the extra features that are available.  The app itself is free so you don't have anything really to lose.  All in all this is a great app.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Couldn't get enough! I read all three while on vacation! Loved it as much as Fifty Shades! I will read these again soon!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Very addictive, definitively recommended. You don't only play mindlessly, but you have to be aware of your finances and use wise building strategy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game and how much it a progressed since the beginning of minecraft it has gone all the way up 7.3 at this point and they are still making more updates now
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great things have written about this.<br /><br />I wanted to highlight one point, since Google didn't mention it during launch.<br />Chromecast works with Ubuntu 12.04. You need to have chrome browser 28.x.x or higher and have Chromecast extension installed.<br /><br />It was easy to setup. Both video and sound plays on your TV.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|Great game except that they don't use the proper name of the universal it well crafted though four stars for this smoothly made game
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|This was so slow and lacked the pop that we are used to today.  The idea as good, but the acting was not matched to the story.<br />hard to follow.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Handy to have a calculator.  Spoiled by not having to think or do my math on paper.  It works easily.  Self explanatory or at least very easy to figure out.
B00821PCJS|3.0|it was not my favorite and would not finish watching the series.  It seemed to have some interesting parts, but found it slow.
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|it is fun but you have to pay for the x rays and stuff. it can be a real rip off.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|If you like spy, intrige and unexpected over the top personalities, and never knowing if your right or not...this is the series.<br />will watch the rest after the Pilot.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So realistic and awsome I can't believe it ! This is greatest book in the whole entire galaxy .  By.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo  blitz is a very challenging bingo game. It's full of different places and slots and specials, one very nice shopping place. It gives you everything. You need to enjoy bingo!
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Arrved on time and was as good as can be expected, the movie came in great condition and was a treat to watch, i enjoyed it
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Before the update i would have given this game 5 stars. Since the update i didn't even want to give it one. I was given no choice but to do the update or i couldn't play. Since then i can not play at all. I uninstalled and redownloaded the game several times. To no avail. I still cant play. Please fix this issue, i really liked this game.
