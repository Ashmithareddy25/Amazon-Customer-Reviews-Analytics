B000I2J6K0|2.0|[[ASIN:B000I2J6K0 Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix]]THIS VIDEO IS REALLY HARD CORE, BUT IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU. NOT FOR THE AVERAGE MOTHER.   The video is divided into 4 sections. The warm up, gets you really warm...typical aerobic class grape vines, etc., The next part is pretty intense lunging, squatting and plank type positions, pushups, etc. The 3rd part is floor work with lots of leg lifts (you'll want a really good thick mat here or your hips will be aching). The last part is stretch and relaxation, although i didn't find it very relaxing. If you are used to Yoga practice for stretching and relaxation, you'll probably want to skip this part as I did and just throw in the stretch and relaxation part of a pre-natal yoga video. (you need water, a mat and a chair to complete this video).
0143038419|1.0|...because I thought I was the only person who really did not like this memoir. The chapters in Italy hit every Tuscan Sun caricature imaginable, and somewhere in the middle -- I believe it was in India -- I drifted off and found it impossible to stay with the main character's rambling prose without bribing myself to keep reading. In the end, I forced myself to read this because everyone in my office raved about it.  From now on, I don't listen to their advice.
B000NVIXDW|1.0|I've been a Michael Buble fan for a while.  Although I love his music, the lisp on this album is so distracting that I can't enjoy his great voice.  I've seen him interviewed, and he doesn't seem to lisp when he speaks.  If it's a real problem, I'm afraid it will be an awful end to a promising career.  If intentional, call it irrethponthible (and insulting to the innocent buyers of this album).  If I consider buying his future albums, I'll preview them first.  Do yourself a favor and listen to this one before you buy.

0143038419|4.0|Well i am curretnly reading this book.  I purchased the book at the suggestion of my sister.  I went online to look at reviews of the book and I have to say I was quite surprised and somewhat angered by the quite negative things some had to say.  Of the 199 1 star ratings I think almost 90% referred to the fact that she was given an advance to write this book.  Why does that bother so much?  Also the talk of her self absored, narsisstic personality....well wasn't his book about her journey to find herself...me, I???  So I was expecting it to be alot about her feelings and thoughts and frankly they are insightful.. She did not set out on her journey to save the world she set out to save herself.  Also just because her husband did not beat her does not mean she did not have any awful marriage, and just because she appeared to have a wonderful live doesn't mean she felt that way...everyone is so quick to throw stones when you don't know the full story and you don't need to...    I have found this book a restful place to go for a few short moments in the evning after taking care of 3 children under the age of 4 and holding down a full time job and all the while trying to recover from a severe bout of post-partum depression.  I savor a few pages everyday and wish I could be that brave and can't wait to see what happens...although the lot of you judgemental, self righteous, jealous, negative, 1 star readers have successfully spoiled it for me

B000U1ZV8K|2.0|I was very disturbed by the large quantity of profane language as well as the nudity In Lethal Weapon: 4 Film.    I would not have ordered this item if I had been previously aware of the bad content.    I originally viewed this item on TV and apparently the censored version was more enjoyable.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Back in its time in the mid 19880s this film was awsome one of the most comnfiscated and most expensive Disney Movie every made. Today it's even better a classic film. Before the release of Chrnonicles Narnina and newer Disney films. When and ex computer executive tries to hack into the computer to prove that his boss stole credits for video games that he designed, he is thrown into and adventure that rivals that of the Digmom movie. Can Flyn and his program Tron stop the evil MCP, his minions Spark and his evil user partner Diligner who stole the credit for flints game designs. Find out in this thrilling 1980s features from disney epic conclusion filled with phonimal effects classic 1980s disney action and adventure. If you like this I also recommend Cloak and Dagger and the Digmon Movie a or movies depending on which cut of them your watching.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Nice and well packaged boxed set. Film is well made although most scenes appear to be a step short of grayscale. I'm sure some of the scenery in the real world these events took place in had a little more color, but nonetheless, the gray adds to the mood of the scenes.
B00111YM5G|4.0|I was rather surprised by this film because I expected it to be yet another low budget flop. surprise! It is very good, has a lot of action, gunfighting, and even some special effects that were pretty good.<br />the story starts off with Gabriel last of the ArcAngels (their spelling, mine is ArchAngel)<br />well, each time he taps into the \\"source aka God\\" for power he not only grows weaker, but alerts all the demons exactly where he is.<br />as if that's not enough, the last 6 arcangels failed to bring about an end to the darkness and now it is totally up to gabriel to end Sammael's Reign of evil and put an end to darkness and finally release the sun.<br /> a really well done flick but if you are looking for constantine style effects you will be dissappointed. this film has quite a few talkie spots but the story is so compelling you might not notice.<br />most of the effects are comprised of super strength, speed, some glowy Particle effects and changing eye color. (eyes seem to represent demon (reddish amber) angel (blue) and regular human eyes.)<br />my only minor gripe with the film was the fact everyone (angels and demons) used guns for fighting and naught else. still great though.<br /><br />Overall: this is a good film not overloaded with effects, blood and gore etc. it is a gripping story about the final fight for purgatory and the souls of earth and the fallen angels. I'd recommend it.<br /><br />4 Stars.<br />Extras Include:<br />deleted Scenes, and 3 making of featurettes. not bad.<br /><br />Buy it here!<br />[[ASIN:B00111YM5G Gabriel]]
B000GG4Y32|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1981.    In a word - AWFUL.     Not only is it awful, it is awfully long. It is so long that when shown in the theater, there was an intermission. The intermission was the best part of the movie as it allowed us to politely leave the theater without disturbing other patrons. Interestingly, there were quite a few others (perhaps half of the theater) who left the same time we did. In all the movies I've attended, I've never seen that happen before or after.    One of the 5 stars reviews noted, \\"Although it did not succeed at the box office,\\"  - Well there is a reason why.    Save your money. Don't waste it on this pathetic propaganda.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|Serj has the views of zeitgeist. He is the kind of person who sees the problems and trys to help. System was the mixture of four great minds. I believe that Serj has outdone himself and has proven himself as a solo musician. I wish people would stop comparing System and Serj.
B000IAZ6W4|5.0|A horrible injustice!! I've never written a review on here before but it just seems sacrilege that this work isn't more recognized here. I only just found it (a happenstance listening in barnes and noble of all places) a week or 2 ago. Like most albums that have found themselves in continuous rotation in my car, it takes a time or 2 of complete run through to grow on me. At listen 2 I can say...  Excellent. two thumbs up. Bravo. Creative yet simple. Dreamy with just a hint of creepiness. Most importantly; original. Difficult to categorize. I do hear elements of a few other artists in there that are worthy of mention;    Black heart procession  portishead  william elliot Whitmore  Muse (you hear it, don't you?)  and maybe a little Tom waits ( more for physical appearance, lyricism and the weird factor) for good measure    all that equals= one of the best albums I've bought in at least a year.

0805079831|5.0|This book should be a must read for everyone. It clearly reports the unbelievable practises of a small group of economists from THe Chicago School of Economics who staged wholesale disruption of countries such as Chile, Argentina, Indonesia, Uraguy and many more to forward Milton Friedman's ideas of a free market world.  The book is an expose of the Neocons who would rule the USA. Cheney, Rumsfeld, Reagan, and the thinktanks of The Cato Institute and others have this agenda in mind when they espouse their \\"Free Markets Economies\\" on the world.  It's a bit heavy going at first, but as you get further along it is hypnotic....a must read for all those concerned about freedom.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I love Pink Floyd but was not able to attend any of their concerts.  This dvd gave me the opportunity to see them and it was AWESOME.  The sound and video is very clear and it was amazing - especially the light shows - it felt as if I was sitting in the audience.  Well worth the purchase if you are a Pink Floyd fan.
B0000AUHPK|3.0|I understand the script of the movie closely matches the original classic, but results in a rather uninspired rendition that even Juliette Binoche and Ralf Fiennes can not enliven. The DVD is definitely worth it for anyone (like me) wanting to get to know the story without reading the novel but is otherwise a little tedious to watch.
B00005MP58|5.0|I mean if that doesn't do it for you alone, then watch for the Austen fan in you. This is the absolute best version of Pride & Prejudice out there. Yes its long, but stays true to the books original quality. If you are a true Austen fan, this adaptation will not disappoint you.
B000U7169M|5.0|If you are looking for something other than slasher/SAW like films, then this is for you.  The story may seem like some other's you have seen over the years, i.e., Rosemary's Baby, etc...but it's a movie that had us stumped until the end...the reviews may not have been good, but it's quality horror, as far as horror goes.  I am sick of gore movies with college age, sex-crazed kids being slashed to death.  This, at least, has a decent storyline and a surprise ending.  I thought it was well done and worth a watch.
B000W1V5VU|4.0|Good price, thought the DVD was broken, but it was just a piece of the plastic circular part that holds the DVD in the case.
B00118RPQC|3.0|Not as good as the first Spider-Man movie.  At times I wondered why certain scenes where left in the movie.  The Spider-Man parade scene was relatively lame.  Even worse, however, was Peter Parker strutting down the street like a bad John Travolta out of \\"Saturday Night Fever.\\"  Finally (and I won't spoil it), the ending confrontation was really weak.  You would think that with 40+ years of Spider-Man material from the comics, they could do better.    Watch it before you buy it on DVD.  I don't know how many times I could take this movie.  Overall grade - a C.
B000M3452Y|4.0|One of the best discs of his category in 2007.   check tracks 4&5 as an appetizer. The qualiity of this record stands out greatly for anybody who likes different kinds of music. I believe it's all in the cohesion of elements: the genres he mixes up are various, but still Murphy makes so as to keep fluidity and pleasure of listening. Very inspired and energetic.
B000OHZL44|1.0|This film is in my all time top 5 for the WORST movies that I've ever seen. I turned it off halfway through after repeating to myself over and over that this is dumb. I wish I could get my money back for the rental, it was that bad. I don't usually post negagive reviews, but this film in my opinion was just plain stupid and not worth the time that I spent watching the little that I did. Avoid it at all costs.    W.Harrison

B000W0NO5Q|4.0|What a surprise: a New York Times bestseller that's actually quite good. I'm normally a little leery of white male authors writing books with main characters who are not also white men (Memoirs of a Geisha is a good example --- it's so clearly a white guy imagining, badly, what a young Japanese woman might think), but this is a happy surprise. Smith, who was born in Zimbabwe and has lived in Botswana, has not only an eye for finding the telling background detail but also an ear for natural dialogue. Granted that I am not an African woman, Precious Ramotswe sounds to me like herself and not like a bad author's ventriloquist trick. The language of the book is charming, direct without being simple, well considered. A lot happens in this book, but it doesn't feel rushed. Instead, by the end I found myself really liking Mme Ramotswe, thoroughly charmed by her adventures both greater and lesser, and looking for more.

B000UD0ESA|5.0|Blade Runner: The Final Cut is an absolute must for fans who know all to well that this cult classic gem has gone through more cuts than a unmentioned well known pop star has had plastic surgery. One might prematurely cringe, having invested in the Director's Cut, thinking that its possible that the studios are trying to milk us for more money. This is far from the case. Blade Runner looks and sounds like a state of the art film. The entire print was digitized and special effects footage was scanned in at 8000 lines per frame. The new sound production quality is quite simply an Oscar worthy effort and the images are as clean as a whistle and sharpened to a razor.<br /><br />The story revolves around Blade Runners, which means they are licensed to kill androids, who are given assignments to retire these illegal skin-jobs if they try to escape captivity from off-world colonies and integrate themselves in with society. Four replicants are on the loose and Blade Runner Deckard must hunt them down through a dystopian city.<br /><br />Ridley Scott's art direction is probably the best the big screen has ever seen which is startling considering that the film is over 25 years old. The film achieved cult status on video after being panned by the critics (many of whom have reversed their position since). The SF author Philip K. Dick died before he could see his book come to life and since then other directors such as Steven Spielberg have filmed his material.<br /><br />So what's new in Blade Runner: The Final Cut?<br />(1) The first meeting between Gaff and Deckard is shorter.<br />(2) Bryant mentions four skin jobs and not five.<br />(3) Some extra crowd shots.<br />(4) The unicorn dream sequence is extended.<br />(5) The snake seller scene has been correctly synced.<br />(6) Deckard meets a policeman before the Snake Pit.<br />(7) Two exotic dancers.<br />(8) Zhora's display case crash has been completely redone.<br />(9) Swear words have been removed from the Tyrell Batty meeting.<br />(10) The Tyrell murder sequence is uncut. You see the gouge.<br />(11) Pris's death sequence is extended.<br />(12) The dove at the end is released into the night sky, not daylight sky.<br /><br />Blade Runner usually makes the top 20 films of all time. Once you have tasted the running you will be back for more. Every collection should have this movie and the final cut is no exception.<br /><br />This is the way Blade Runner is meant to be seen. It is a movie about eyes and is all about seeing. Cherish the vision.see the gouge.  (11) Pris's death sequence is extended.

0743277708|5.0|This book has outlasted many favourite-books-of-the-moment in my life. I continually come back to it, rereading it with great pleasure each time. It's the kind of book where you suddenly feel the need to read passages aloud.<br />On the surface, a simple tale of talking rabbits. Yet I would never classify it as children's literature. An adventure with heroes and villians, peril and friendship, but it's even more than that. There is a subtext that can be interpreted to represent issues about government and society.<br />Yet at the same time, the rabbits seem very realistic. Not just humans in rabbit form. Most have trouble with complicated concepts, ie. when they need to cross a river and two of the rabbits are too tired to swim, only one rabbit understands the concept of hitching a ride on a piece of wood to float across. They also encounter a rabbit warren that is more intellectually advanced, having created art and poetry. The main characters have trouble grasping these concepts.<br />The characters are well-developed, as is the rabbit culture they come from. They are very much like primitive people, with an oral tradition of mythology but little concept of anything outside their own life. They see everything; other animals, plants, structures, etc as how it relates to themselves.<br />It's a book that can be read on many levels. Adventure or allegory, everyone can take something from this story. I highly recommend it.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|The pricing and condition of the \\"My So Called Life\\" DVD's are excellent.  I'm thoroughly enjoying my purchase
0440419514|5.0|I don't understand what the fuss is about, the story is so clearly fantastical to me that I can't imagine getting so upset about one man's opinions about God, the Universe, and Everything.  The books are engaging, well-written, and certainly thought-provoking.  Lyra is a flawed heroine, she is not portrayed as a sweet naive innocent, and that's what makes her so appealing.  I sense that some of Pullman's intent was to show children in a realistic light, not the fantasy naive innocents created by adults who pine for a time that never existed except in their imaginations.    I will say though, the first book especially is severely disturbing, with the ghoulish experiments and the snatching of the children, I can't imagine this book really being intended for kids, it's so dark and disturging and terrifying at times.  Then again, this series also illustrates why as a kid I vastly preferred British kid lit over American kid lit, with a few exceptions here and there, sure.  On the whole, the English don't seem to feel a great need to clean up the unpleasant side of human nature the way Americans do.  Maybe what's got some people squealing so loud about these books is the unpleasant reflection in the mirror.  I honestly don't know.
B0000041XX|5.0|The talent of these men is wonderful.  Carraras is not my favorite but the CD is worth every cent to hear Domingo and Pavarotti.  I have given this CD as a gift several times to share these beautiful voices with my friends and family.  Everyone should cherish every note Pavarotti sings since he won't sing again.
0553582461|4.0|And perhaps you won't agree.  But after the roller coaster that is Fitz's life, and after you've learned to accept \\"good enough\\" for him all along, the conclusion seems trite.  For this reader, it needed to be either stunningly good, or stunningly bad.  After all, nothing in Fitz's life has been anything short of either one of those two extremes.<br /><br />Ending aside, the book itself merits five stars.  Much more active, interesting, decisive than the first two of the Fool trilogy, it's what I came to this series for.  Something is constantly happening, which makes up for little happening in the two preceding books.  You go new places with new and fascinating people and meet the antagonist behind it all.  Fool's Fate is more tragic than the opening books of this trilogy, disturbing if you're squeamish, but in that sense, it's truer to the overall Fitz story.<br /><br />All things considered, the series, in addition to the Assassin trilogy, has been a wild ride that I don't recommend anyone willingly miss.  Robin Hobb herself rates five stars and she didn't let us down with the Fool books.
0525950079|3.0|This sequel, like most sequels, pales in comparison with Pillars of the Earth. On the plus side the book is well-researched and the story is entertaining. Yet the characters are implausible and after a while the roller coaster ride of continual twists and turns in the plot becomes monotonous. Minor foibles: the author contradicts what was written earlier, hardly noticeable unless you have a penchant for detail, and he uses \\"shag\\" intermittently with its more familiar American verb, usage that I do not believe was popular in 14th century England.<br />If you read this book as a standalone, you will be satisfied; if you read it after Pillars you will be disappointed. If you have not read either, read \\"Pillars\\" and leave it at that.

B000002I4W|5.0|I expect that enough has already been said about this music and its importance in the development of jazz.  Chances are you'll either love it (like me) or hate it.  If you're planning to buy this recording, I'd highly recommend getting the 2005 remastered version, in the Atlantic Masters series.  The sound quality is noticeably better than in this older version--it's not \\"enhanced,\\" there's just more information. Sort of like the difference between regular TV and HDTV.  Last time I checked, it was only 3 or 4 bucks more than this one--and well worth it. (If you upgrade, like I did, I can almost guarantee you'll be delighted.)  Unfortunately this item doesn't show up under Ornette Coleman, but it comes up when you type in Shape of Jazz to Come.  Coleman's CHANGE OF THE CENTURY is also available in this remastered series, and it also sounds wonderful.
B000V1Y43W|4.0|I love all Pixar movies. This one is similarly great. The visuals are gorgeous on Bluray, and the story is very entertaining. I just felt that the middle part of the story was a tad slow perhaps, given how much adrenaline there was in the beginning of the movie.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I loved this little film, and beyond that, the music.  It's so much a part of the film that it's hard to separate. Luckily both are revelations -- intelligent, beautifully rendered, and emotional.  The music is absolutely lovely -- folk/rock at its finest, and with a gentle bitter dryness that keeps it from being too sweet.  The album is first-rate, the singing is beautiful (both singers offer sweet voices), and the song \\"Falling Slowly\\" haunted me, staying with me for days in all its bittersweet gorgeousness.  I especially love the way Glen Hansard (of the Frames) takes so many of the higher harmonies, with Marketa taking the lower ones -- it adds an unexpectedness to the harmonies that always keeps you listening.<br /><br />The album is a must for any who enjoy intelligent indie songwriting, folk/rock, or who are simply seeking something wonderful and evocative. And don't miss the movie.
0312330529|4.0|A fantastic book that makes you yearn to live some of it yourself.  Bombay sounds fantastic, and GDR manages to capture the spirit of the city and the people exceptionally well.   I did find he found a few too many people to \\"love\\" him, and a he makes himself out to be just a little too much rightous.   A little bit too mother teresa who can street fight.....    If even 1/3 of this book is true - then its truly amazing.    Impossible to not enjoy this book. Just read with a slightly open mind.

B0010ZR160|5.0|With a cast such as Morgan Freeman, Casey Affleck & Ed Harris, I already knew this film had to be pretty good, well it was more than that, it was absolutely genius, totally non predictable with a very intriguing twist towards the end...! I loved this movie, it engages in many different sentimental issues and leaves you with a great morale that any kinds of decisions are never simple or easy to make especially when it involves a child.
B000WCDI5K|4.0|This CD is not like Sam's Town or Hot Fuss. The first time I listened to it I didn't really care for it but the more often I listen to it, the more it's growing me. I like now that it's different.
0810994739|5.0|I bought this book for my 9 year old son after buying the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid book. He read this one, just like the first one, in a day. He couldn't put either of them down. Being that my son was so into them, I had to read them, too. They are both amusing and made me smile many times. Just simple stories about a boy going through a year of school. I recommend it if you are looking for a funny read for your child.
0375842209|5.0|This book is not only unique and ambitious, it is positively brilliant and a MUST READ for people of all ages. I HIGHLY recommend it for book clubs, and as required reading for history or social studies courses.    Written from the perspective of the omniscient \\"Death,\\" this Holocaust story forces the reader to reconsider his/her notions of the average German citizens during this horrific time in history. This tale of a yourng girl and her partner-in-crime best friend, forces us to consider not all German citizens were in favor of the Nazi party, Hitler's Youth Organizations, or hating the Jews. As a Jew myself, it is a hard pill to swallow, since it is far easier to blame the average German citizen for not doing anything to stop the horrors, yet this book reminds us that not everyone was to blame. Do the small acts of defiance such as hiding a jew in a basement, or throwing bread to starving jews on their march to a concentration camp absolve these people from blame? That is for each reader to decide for him/herself.     While this book is likely to be considered a \\"Holocaust novel\\" it is truly so much more than that. It is an extremely important read and something you will want to discuss after reading. I can't recommend it highly enough and can't wait to read more of this brilliant author's works!
0345409671|4.0|[[ASIN:1595072160 The Angel Hunter]]<br />When Lestat is confronted by the devil and is told that he has an explanation for his actions and that God is the one with problem, I thought Anne Rice had backed herself into a corner that was impossible to write your way out of. But she did it! This book is dark and gruesome and well worth the read just for the dialogue between Lestat and Memnoch and how the author spins biblical lore in a new direction. The only drawback is the ending that is a bit deflating. I expected more of a revelation for Lestat and it never came. But, that's just me.
B000VWE5OY|2.0|I was very anxious to view this show once I received it but quite frankly, it wasn't as good as I expected. Of course being a BBC show should have been a clue to me that the cast would be British, therefore with British accent & expressions that I'm not custom to hear, which made it really painful to understand. As for the plot, well, I can't say that it was that great either. I'm just used to better quality than this. One thing for sure, I'm not buying season 2, and might not even rent it... Definitely not worth the asking price.
B000YAA6AU|4.0|After seeing the trailer for this movie I decided that this probably wasn't the film for me.  It looked like a weepy romantic comedy.  However, one idle Sunday afternoon I found myself at my local multiplex with a ticket in my hand for this movie.      I must say that I was pleasently surprised.  Some parts of the film are sad, some parts are funny and other parts are romantic. But to call this film a romantic comedy would be a disservice.  It is more apt to call it a comedy-drama.    Some critics have said that Swank is badly cast.  I would disagree.  In the hands of another actor, the role may have seemed too whimsical and light.  Swank gives Holly a kind of grounding. The performances from the supporting cast were also first-rate.    There are some weaknesses with the storyline.  I thought that the character of Holly relied a little too heavily on \\"fate\\" and on receiving \\"signs\\". I also thought that it was a little inconsistant that a couple who were supposed to be struggling financially could afford a trip to Ireland.  But to dismiss the film entirely because of these points would be just nit picking.  This film may not change your life but there are worse ways of spending a few hours.

B000TKW3E2|5.0|I purchased the soundtrack after hearing it in the movie.  I was drawn by the unique use of the sound of a typewriter as part of the musical theme.  You'll enjoy listening - and it did win the oscar for best movie score.

B0010ZR160|4.0|This film is, above all, a morality tale.  Patrick, the main character, is sympathetic precisely because the things he does aren't always smart and perhaps aren't always the best thing to do but he is guided by a moral compass that is so strong it leads him to place his life in jeopardy and to sacrifice some of the things that are the most important to him.  It's hard not to admire someone who sticks to his principles no matter the consequences and though things don't always work out for him it must be reassuring for him to know that he has remained true to himself.    The movies opens with Patrick, who is a private detective who normally tracks people down for collection agencies, and his girlfriend/partner Angie accepting a job searching for a child who has gone missing.  The mystery surrounding this event is intriguing and disturbing, involving as it does the seedy underbelly of Boston which is chock full of drug dealers and addicts and child molesters.  Patrick becomes consumed with the case and it leads him in directions he couldn't have imagined.  One of the best scenes takes place between Patrick and police detective Remy in which Patrick questions his own actions even as everyone else is more or less patting him on the back.  The scene shows just how self-aware a person Patrick is.    The acting is top notch with Casey Affleck's affecting turn as Patrick a notable standout.  Ben's little brother is a prodigious talent and his portrayal of Patrick is extremely authentic.  Michelle Monaghan is very effective as Angie, who at the start seems to be the moral center of the film but whose beliefs can later leave the viewer very uncomfortable.  Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are both excellent and both play characters who divert from the roles to which I am accustomed seeing them play.      Ed Harris is particularly chilling as a police detective who has a very dark side.  Dark as he is, it isn't hard to see why someone in his position might turn out as he does.  Remy Bressant is a character who forces the viewer to think more deeply about law enforcement officers and what it must be like to deal with the worst of society and to bear daily witness to the atrocities that humans can commit against one another.  If such thoughts do not cause one to be more thankful for and respectful of those who put themselves in the line of fire to protect others, I don't know what will.  Bressant, though, is a character who uses his experience to justify his actions and this is what makes him so disturbing as a characters.    The movie's direction is also more than worthy of mention and if this is what can be expected of Ben Affleck, I look forward to more of his films and hope he will have a long career as a director.  Lighting and scenery are used to great effect here and Affleck gets a lot out of his actors.  The tone of the film is moody and the muted colors and shadowy lighting contribute a great deal to the atmosphere.      Though this is anything but a happy movie, it's a perfect example of why films should be celebrated.  It's cerebral, the type of movie that will keep the viewer thinking for days.  More movies should be like this one.
B000005Z0E|5.0|Tupac Shakur released his debut album in 1991 with a wave of political rap that touched on subject matter that had never really been stressed before. His heart-on-his-sleeve rapping immediately draws the listener in and lets you feel what he's feeling. 2Pac always had a strong ability to put you in his shoes or the shoes of the oppressed. His legend was born on this album and its impact on music is still felt 17 years after its release.

0452289963|2.0|Unnecessarily wordy and shallow  I have read many books on topics such as this and I was disappointed on how complicated the author tired to make the subject.   It wasn't until page 72 that a simple sentence finally rang through all of the noise, and that \\"shining through\\" was very rare in this book. I hope that people don't miss the simple truths, a simple awareness and the simplicity of Being.
B000YABYLA|5.0|So much's been said of Juno. Ellen Page really lights up this small budget film. As an initially reckless and horny girl who decides to bed her best friend, the dorky Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), Juno McGrath (Ellen Page) soon finds herself in a fix after their one-night stand. Soon, Juno has to grapple with the fact that she would be an unwed mother. Whilst visiting an abortion clinic, she got cold feet (partly due to her activist classmate Su-Ching's one-girl protest outside the clinic). From then on, her search for a pair of perfect adoptive parents leads her to the Lorings played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner. The film shows Page's evolution into a precocious young lady with lots of humor and more heart.<br /><br />Ellen Page's acting is surprisingly mature. It looks as if she's not just acting but rather living the role. The script by Diablo Cody is witty and  bittersweet. The supporting cast works well to illuminate Page's role. Look for the ending when Cera and Page performs their rendition of The Moldy Peaches' Anyone Else But You. That's enough to melt the hardest of hearts. (A)
B000068CNX|5.0|While the first season of the show is highly enjoyable, it really begins to hit its stride in season two as we get to learn more about each characters' particular eccentricities and we witness more of the ties that bind these characters in friendship.  The most important element of this show was the chemistry that these actors had together and season two shows them really continuing to click.    Some of my favorites:    \\"The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant\\": Monica unwittingly loses her job when her promotion leads her to accept a gift which, unbeknownst to Monica, is a violation of company policy.  The thing I like most about this episode is how it treats the disparate incomes of the characters and how the more financially strapped of the friends must deal with the financial advantages of the others.  Been there, done that.    \\"The One with the Baby on the Bus\\": Chandler and Joey prove just how stupid they can be when the inadvertently leave Ross's son Ben on a city bus.  Phoebe's immortal \\"Smelly Cat\\" is introduced in this episode and she loses her performing gig at Central Perk, much to my chagrin as her strange lyrics and musical interpretation provided me with much mirth.  The episode also contains a memorable guest appearance by Chrissie Hynde, who is Phoebe's replacement.    \\"The One Where Ross Finds Out\\": Rachel has a hilariously bad date that leads to a drunken confession of her feelings for Ross on his answering machine.  What I love most about this episode is Ross's immortal line: \\"You're over me?  When were you under me?\\"     \\"The One with the List\\": Ross breaks a cardinal rule by putting in writing things that are deeply hurtful to Rachel.      \\"The One with Russ\\": Rachel dates Ross's clone, though she doesn't know it at first.  It's great fun to see David Schwimmer play two versions of his character.    \\"The One After the Super Bowl\\": Chock full of guest starts doing a hilarious turn.  Chandler gets his comeuppance courtesy of Julia Roberts.  DanCastellaneta (aka the voice of Homer Simpson) does a funny turn as a San Diego Zoo employee who has the information Ross is looking for but does a spectacularly bad job of trying to get Ross to pay for it.  Brooke Shields is hysterical as a wacko fan who is convinced that Joey truly is Dr. Drake Ramore.    \\"The One with the Prom Video\\": We've seen how petty and downright mean Ross can be and now this episode shows us how kind and generous and thoughtful he can be.  This has to be one of the most memorable episodes in the series' long history.    \\"The One Where Eddie Won't Go\\": Ah, how I can relate to Chandler's troubles with a truly deranged roommate.  Watching Joey and Chandler convince Eddie that he doesn't live with Chandler is so rewarding.    \\"The One with the Chicken Pox\\": Few things are as funny as watching Phoebe and guest star Charlie Sheen paw at one another with oven mitts duct taped to their hands.  This is one of the episodes that shows how unlucky in love poor, sweet Phoebe is.    As I looked over the list and tried to choose my favorites, I realized I could have mentioned every single episode of season two.

B000PC1N54|3.0|If you're going to buy this AIDA because this is the production Roberto Alagna walked out on, you're going to be confused.  The only thing I can figure is they taped a couple of the performances, including a dress rehearsal and then spliced all the good parts together to make the DVD.  Alagna's singing of \\"Celeste Aida\\" is awful but you don't hear any booing from the audience unless it was edited out.  He excels in the last two acts and the audience lets him know it.  There is very little love shown between him and Aida.  Alagna seems to be concentrating on the music and seldom takes his eyes off the conductor.  Generally the singing is quite good from all the principals but Aida is plump and Amneris is svelte and regal.  It's kind of hard to believe Radames chooses Aida.  The sets and costumes by Franco Zefirelli are spectacular but ruined by TV director Patrizia Carmine who tries to turn this into a music video using lots of superimposed images, blurry fade outs and bellowing sheets in various colors blocking too many key scenes.  The consumer should be warned this is a cinematic version of this opera which doesn't succeed. Verdi's music doesn't need any help.  Holding all the pieces together is Riccardo Chailly the conductor whom the audience clearly worships.  Franco Ziffrelli comes out at the end and it was sad to see he had to be helped walking on the stage.  Say what you will about his grand productions, they are never boring.  I already have four AIDA'S on DVD and welcome this latest effort.

It's got hours of in depth features, great picture quality on all the films included, and it has ever version of the film ever made plus one that no one has ever seen, the ultra rare work print version. Very cool set and a must have for Blade Runner fans everywhere.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|Finally, I have the complete Bladerunner collection. The first movie I bought was the final cut on dvd a couple of years ago. Since then I allways wanted to have the original movie version on dvd, but in Belgium it was only available on vhs. Then came the announcement of the final cut and ever since I wanted to have it on Blueray Disc. After calling with several stores I knew that the 5-disc BR version would only be released via the US. Luckily for me it is zonefree so I immediately ordered it via Amazon. The good thing about this is that I payed as much for the 5-disc collection as I would pay if I bought the final cut here in Belgium. (the final cut version on blueray costs as much due to the dollar vs euro)    So after a couple of weeks I finally received the 5-disc collection and I must say it is great and exceeds what I expected. Especially the 2 bonus discs are great. (1 of the discs is over 3 hours of making of!)    It was great finally seeing the original movie version with the voiceover. (there are 2 movie versions on it, US and International ones) Then theres the final cut version which looks great on blueray. As another extra you get the workprint version which I haven't looked at.    So this is the disc setup:  disc1: final cut  disc2: movie versions (2) + director's cut  disc3: making of  disc4: another disc of extra's  disc5: workprint    Overall a great box and well worth the money. I would recommend this Blueray box to any Bladerunner fan.    Maybe one remark though: No subtitling with the 2 bonus discs, so I needed to turn up the volume for the 2 bonus discs to be able to hear everything on the bonus discs. (English isn't my primary language)
044022425X|2.0|The only really great book of Gabaldon's was Outlander or \\"Cross Stitch\\" and it certainly got my emotions up. I flung the damned book accross the room at the ridiculousness of the wolf scene. It was just too much but that was close to the end of the book and I was already hooked. It became one of my favorite books.  I loved the characters and read the next 2 books and they were very enjoyable but not new or great, just good. This fourth book I read and barely got through. Claire and Jamie by this point are no longer interesting and the erotica are the only interesting points and I don't pick up a 900 page book for erotica (bad at that). What stupid scenarios are in this book. I couldn't like Briana and what's his name, idiot or the situations they got into. 'In the fronteer you leave a woman unprotected?' He is a historian for **##* sake. It dragged a lot and didn't really have a good plot or direction and the adventure had died.    I did finally get through this book hoping that it would improve to at least half of the 2nd or 3rd books enjoyability. The only thing that it did was continue the story. The next book was even worse if you can believe it and after a 1/3, I ended up skimming through to get the story. I haven't even opened the 6th because of the 4th and 5th. It was given to me Christmas a year ago. It did get better reviews but I just couldn't handle another waste of time like the 4th or 5th book just to see where these characters were going.
074356619X|4.0|Listening to the ideas expressed in the book in this set was much more compelling, and made the \\"Law of Attraction\\" easier to understand and apply, even if the doubt lingers.  Why not believe in the power of The Secret?  It can't hurt!
184195425X|5.0|The Life of Pi is one of the more original books that I have ever read.  From the beginning to the end, there is nearly nothing with which to compare it, and the originality makes the book not only unique, but also praise-worthy.<br /><br />The main character's name is Piscine, but he goes by Pi because his given name sounds like a bodily function.  His family owns a zoo, and Pi is an eager, and intelligent participant in all things related to the family business.  He knows about all sorts of animals, their traits, their habits, their odd idiosyncrasies.  Aside from zoo life, Pi is also extremely pious, so much so that he is a practicing Christian, Hindu, and Muslim.  This is a source of great pride, but also great difficulty in his life.  Pi truly wants to do what is right, and he wants to follow religion.  I suppose he's an agnostic without the skepticism; he believes there is something out there, something transcendent, but doesn't know how to follow it/him.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Pi's family, life becomes difficult because of political turmoil, and one day they decide to pack up and take a ship across the ocean from Pondicherry, India to Canada.  Tragedy strikes when Pi awakes to find that the freighter with his family and many exotic animals is sinking.  With nearly no time to think, Pi finds himself looking for a way to survive.  Seconds later, he's in a lifeboat with a spotted hyena, an orangutan named Orange Juice, a zebra with a broken leg, and a massive Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker - incidentally, the story behind Richard Parker's name is a nice sidebar to the story.<br /><br />As one could imagine, hunger and thirst begin to dictate the way of life on a lifeboat adrift in the ocean, and the floating Wild Kingdom episode begins.  Naturally, the only animals left over are Pi and Richard Parker.  But sooner or later Richard Parker will see Pi as a big slab of beef, and Pi needs to figure out how to tame the tiger.<br /><br />Without ruining the incredible story, it's safe to say that they both survive through unbelievably harsh conditions, and Pi learns that his wits and his knowledge of animal behavior is all he has to survive.  After 9 months, a time in which they very nearly died of starvation, thirst, and exposure, they float ashore in Mexico.<br /><br />It's one of the best books I've read in a very long time, and I'm sure I'll read it again.  In a sea of bad knock-off books where each suspense novel has the same twist, each romance novel follows the same played out script, and each sci-fi book seems to be a Lord of the Rings or Xanth rip-off, it's great to read something completely and refreshingly original.<br /><br />This immediately moves into my top ten most enjoyable books to read during a long weekend on a beach.ay that they both survive through unbelievably harsh conditions, and Pi learns that his wits and his knowledge of animal behavior is all he has to survive.

6305907145|1.0|The movie takes Jane Austin's plot, mostly.  It slaughters the characters, particularly Fanny Price.  The young woman portrayed here bears no resemblance to Miss Austin's creation.  She may be a spunky and \\"modern\\" person, but she does not have a fraction the depth of the original and is an almost total opposite of her.  Edmund is reduced to a shadow figure.  Sir Thomas and his lady are both villified, especially the latter.  There is no excuse for the liberties taken.  The producers could have done a parody set in the present time if they chose, but to destroy the original, to spoil it for people unfamiliar with the book, is unpardonable.

0060989157|5.0|Before I read The Dirt, I could name exactly one song by Motley Crue, and only because it's featured in guitar hero 3.    It turns out, I'd heard quite a few of their songs over the years, but the appeal of this book has nothing to do with the music, and everything to do with their lives.    I think it's fairly obvious to say that these men lived atypical lives.  The booze, drugs, sex, money, and fame aren't something that most of us can relate to.  But it sure makes for a compelling story.      Reading this book inspired me to actually check the band out (since I've always been more of a modern music junkie, and wasn't even born until these guys were at the height of their fame).  That led me to Sixx:AM, Nikki's later project, which is just awesome.      I think every young rocker should read this book, not for inspiration, but as a cautionary tale.
B000VWE5OY|2.0|I have been a fan of Dr. Who for as long as I can remember, so having a spin off of the show was enticing. I checked out Torchwood at the local library, and I'm so glad I didn't buy it!    I watched two episodes and the beginning of the third when I realized I wasn't enjoying it. About mid way through the first episode, I was wondering when the episode would be over.    I'm not sure what the writers are trying to do here. All the characters are smug and egotistical to the point where I do not care about their characters. What's more, they have this awesome responsibility of protecting the earth with alien technology and they themselves are irresponsible by abusing the technology in the first episode. Even Captain Jack, who was a fun character in Dr. Who, is too full of himself for my taste - and for me to keep watching.    The show itself seems a little cheap on scripts and themes. Not a lot of thought seemed to go into the title music either.    Maybe you start to like the characters more as the series progresses? But since the writers and actors failed to wow me at the first episode, I'll watch the first three seasons of Dr. Who again.
B0014CQNTK|4.0|Let's face it -- teen pregnancy is an ongoing problem, and is not something admirable or funny. But I have to admit, the way you handle it can be.<br /><br />That seems to be the goal of \\"Juno,\\" a relentlessly quirky, cracking-wise little comedy about a girl who makes a dumb mistake, and the smart decisions she has to make after that. While it initially seems rather precious, the Wes Andersonesque scriptings hide a bittersweet, warm little story about responsibility and love.<br /><br />After a lot of Sunny D and three pregnancy tests, Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) comes to the inevitable conclusion: she's pregnant by her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).<br /><br />Because she \\"heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant,\\" Juno initially goes in for an abortion, but ends up running out of the clinic. Instead, she's going to have the baby and give it to someone who wants one, but can't have it. So she reluctantly fesses up to her parents, and starts scouting ads for suitably (if unedgy) parents for her baby -- the wealthy Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner).<br /><br />Mark and Juno form a bond over their shared tastes, but she starts to suspect that not all is well in Yuppieland -- especially when Mark decides to break up with Vanessa, because fatherhood would force him to be a grown-up, not a rock god. As her due date approaches, Juno must decide what is best for herself, Vanessa, the baby... and just maybe, the adoring Paulie.<br /><br />Recliners on the lawn, cactus-grams, guitars with names and \\"The Wizard of Gore\\" -- it's pretty obvious that \\"Juno\\" will win prizes for kooky quirk, if nothing else. It certainly has that in spades, and while it has some awkwardly scripted moments, the colourful and acerbic portrait of a teenage girl having to make some heavy adult decisions is definitely a winning one.<br /><br />Admittedly, \\"Juno\\" is a bit too precious in the first few scenes, when we have a weird store clerk saying things like \\"Your eggo is preggo\\" and getting replies like \\"Silencio!\\" Come on, loosen up and stop trying to be cooler-than-thou.<br /><br />But as the pregnancy storyline really kicks in, \\"Juno\\" settles into a storyline that is equal parts quirky-funny and touching.

As the movie winds on, we get to see Juno maturing -- learning to weigh coolness vs. maturity, appreciate her family, and what is right for her baby and the Lorings -- the scene where Juno helps an upset Vanessa talk to her baby is adorable. Not to mention that our pregnant heroine has to figure out whether true love is staring her in the face.<br /><br />Ellen Page gives a note-perfect performance -- her Juno is funny, sassy, wise beyond her years, and profoundly unconventional (\\"Thundercats are go!\\").

B000ZIZ1A6|3.0|I must say that I was disappointed with the CD.  The DVD version of this had more music and I guess that's what I was expecting.

If so, (and I believe that it was) it is disappointing that more music was not featured.  --Pastor Switz

B0012QTT6M|5.0|I watched this show because I liked Bryan Cranston on Malcolm in the Middle. It just looked really funny in a dark way. The fact that their son(and the actor who plays him) have cerebral palsy also was struck a chord because so do I. It's a great show darkly funny-and something people will relate to. Suddenly having the rug jerked out from under you and how to deal with it. It begs the question if you were Walt what would you do??
B00005JPNY|2.0|Am I the only one who finds it ridiculous that the studios are trying to charge $35 for a film that is one third of a trilogy? The cgi are impressive but the plot leaves the viewer hanging, as does the book. Unlike the Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia the Golden Compass really doesn't stand on its own. However, I suspect that Middle America will be very upset if the trilogy is filmed and the third episode is true to the book.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is an excellent film; writing, directing, and cinematography are all excellent.  The acting, featuring wonderful performances by Martina Gedeck and Ulrich Muhe, is superb.  What this film conveys so well is the experience of living in a repressive and corrupt police state like the GDR.  In proportion to population, the East German State Security service (the Stasi) was impressively large and a significant fraction of the GDR's population were informants for the Stasi.<br />The story line is clever.  A veteran Stasi operative is detailed to perform surveillance on a well known playwright.  The latter, however, is not a dissident but involved in a romance with a talented actress who is being pursued simultaneously by a powerful Minister.  The goal of the surveillance is to find something that will allow the playwright to be eliminated as a romantic rival.  Both the Stasi officer and the playwright are committed to the regime.  The movie suspensefully details their mutual disillusionment and the Stasi officer becomes emotionally involved with playwright and in love, albeit from a distance, with the actress girlfriend.  The parallelism is expanded as the Stasi officer creatively fabricates information to prevent the playwright from being jailed.<br />The movie does a wonderful job of showing how the nature of the GDR fostered an atmosphere of constant mutual suspiscion, degrading the quality of personal life.  The ease with which the system could be exploited by the powerful is shown well also.  The multiple humiliating, and often actually degrading compromises of personal integrity and the betrayals needed to get by in the GDR are presented in a matter of fact manner that emphasizes the pervasive effects of the police state.<br />The ending, however, is somewhat melodramatic and sentimental, which tends to underlmine the effectiveness of the film's portrayal of the GDR.  There is also an element of the romantic notion that art is liberating, which is questionable.
B0006GANN2|2.0|I have read the other reviews and think that most of the other reviewers are aging hippies that saw this movie in the '70s when it came out. The music was great and imaginative. The stake out scenes were too long.There was probably 30 minutes during stake outs that had maybe 4-5 pages of dialoge. Anyway the ending was typical of the time like \\"Billy Jack\\" or Easy Rider\\". Show the cops in a bad light and let the rotten drug dealer get away. I'm sure it appealed to teenagers back then, but not today where we have 30+ years of hindsight on the drug scene. The mark of a great film is how soon would like to see it again. The answer in this case is never. I would rather get a root canal!
1932073221|5.0|This is an excellent book. I had the first addition and read it over and over until I practically wore it out. I loaned it to a friend and it never came back. Of  course, I had to replace it! I haven't finished reading it!
0375842209|5.0|The best book I have read in many years. Very well written. It was educational for me as well. Amazing story, great characters, and the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat. This book is amazing.
0446528056|5.0|I haven't read all of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was a little different than the ones I have read.  Most end happily.  This one is full of sadness, regret, and longing.  But it nonetheless entertains.  It is a wonderful book for any fan of romance.  Because we all know that love doesn't always have a happy ending.
0887307280|4.0|This is a must read book for the entrepreneur. It doesn't matter if you are old hat or just thinking.When there is no sense of where to start...look no further! This book opens the mind and provides greater expectation of success.   I operated a franchise for many years without the benefit of this knowledge. It would have been very useful in shaping the past and moving into the future. It reads quickly.It demands ongoing reviews...perhaps with a high lighter in hand...Buy it now. You won't regret it. Share it with someone who needs intelligent direction. Michael Gerber has it right!

It is not my intention to convince non-Christians that they should convert, nor is it my intention to convince other Christians that they must agree with my opinions.  What follows is simply my view of this item through the lens of my understanding of the Christian faith, so I trust that none will be offended by points-of-view I express with which they disagree.  Peace.    This movie is really a parody of two things.  First, it is a parody of the Middle Ages in England.  Second, it is a parody of our modern presuppositions of that time.  It is because the door of parody swings both ways in this film that it is able to be so incredibly funny.  Parody is funny because there is an element of truth involved.  Here, there are two truths, thus the film is twice as funny: there is the truth concerning the Middle Ages, and there's the truth concerning our impressions of the Middle Ages.  By cracking fun at both of these sources of truth, the Monty Python comedy group was able to produce solid parody that is smart, witty, and and in some ways convicting.  Overall, the film is very enjoyable and fun to watch and re-watch.    As a Christian, however, I have a couple of minor reservations about watching this film.  First, though by no means comparable to much of the filth that comes out of Hollywood these days, this movies has a fair share of foul language.  Some of the worst incidents of foul language are likely to go unnoticed because of the accent/language barrier and the manner of production.  For example, at one point the film cuts quickly to a character from a previous scene who says that at least his scene didn't involve a litany of a certain category of sex jokes.  Here, this character uses a less than appropriate word which is not even appropriate for me to repeat.  However, itgoes by so fast that I didn't even notice it until the third or fourth time I watched the movie.    Most of the foul language used is less overtly offensive, and especially because much of this language seems to be well established within the English-comedy tradition it is almost fair to say that it's an essential part of making a funny parody of this sort.  Needless to say, if you are uncomfortable with some incidents of foul language, or if you simply don't think such usage is funny, this movie probably is not for you.  This movie also contains one scene with a significant amount of sexual innuendo and here there is even a reference to oral sex.  However, insofar as this scene does not contain any overtly sexual content of a graphic nature, I think it is not so bad as to require Christians to avoid watching the movie altogether.    I give this movie five stars because it is very funny and smart.  It is an example of a type of humor that is hard to come by these days.  However, I would hesitate to give this movie to anyone younger than 18 or so; I know that when I watched this movie for the first time when I was 15 I did not have the spiritual maturity to discriminate between the quality parody and the few incidents of inappropriate tastelessness.  Other than that, this movie is a classic, and I hope you enjoy it!
B00003CX9E|5.0|This film and \\" Casablanca\\" are my two favorite films of all time.In a way, Charles Foster Kane is much like Amazon. com,, writing up a \\"declaration of principles,\\" then not carrying them out as time goes by. Reviewers have been asked to limit their comments to 75-300 words. Why not enforce it, lest Joseph Cotten types start ripping up checks and going elsewhere?
B000VBJEEG|5.0|We enjoyed watching Ratatouille with our grandchildren.  This movie is one of the best animated features we own.  The action kept the children interested and the morals gave the adults something to think about.  It shows that family is important and being different can be an asset.
B000Q79HS8|3.0|While I am a big fan of the Bourne series, this one is my least favorite of the bunch.  It just seems to repetitive and many elements are there simply because they were there in the earlier movies (at least to me ;-).  Sometimes having an action sequence is great, but when it seems to be forced into the story, well it just doesn't come off as well.  I would recommend this movie for rental but not purchase unless part of the complete 3 movie set.
B000H0MKOC|2.0|Watching it now, and it is rather lame, frankly.  Very obvious, very smarmy, very amateur.  It's not the worst ever, so it gets a 2.  But I would not watch it again, nor would I recommend it.    I don't like smoking, I'd be happy if it was banned as a nuisance to others.      That said, this movie is really, really full of itself.  And, sadly, it's more about hatred of the USA than it is about smoking evils.  It's just another typical Hollywood bait and switch, telling you it will be about one thing when it's really a socialist film using tabaco as the vehicle.  Maybe young Rietman has a skewed view of the world and the USA, growing up in the excesses of Hollywood, and is consumed with liberal guilt, convinced the USA is a bad, racist country (moreso than other countries, at least) and the cause of all the world's problems.  And I'm sure he thinks he's being smart and clever with this film (as did the author of the book).  But he's really just promoting the liberal agenda as usual with the same old line.  And one new line: home ownership is the root of all evil.  Who knew?    2 stars...
B0013D8LOU|2.0|This is a musical:  It should have good music, not bad.  It should be entertaining, not boring.  Ben & Arthur was more entertaining.
B00005MP58|5.0|Updated 4/22:  I should completely change my review.  I love this movie, now. . . love it!<br /><br />I have watched this twice more since I wrote this review and also watched the Keira Knightley version again.  Keira Knightley lacked all the cleverness that Jennifer Ehle brought to the role.  Keira was angry all the time and almost unlikeable at all times.  Jennifer was charming and likeable at all times.  This is really one of my favorite films of all time and I'm stunned that I originally thought this.  Did I have too much wine that night? I don't know-- this was such a perfect movie.  I don't think I've ever changed my mind so much about a film EVER.<br />********************************<br /><br />This was my old pathetic review: I realize that this version is more authentic than the Keira Knightly version.  But, that version was much more entertaining. And, even though I don't usually really like Keira Knightly, she was incredibly charming in this particular film.<br /><br />That said, I so wanted to like this! And, based on the reviews, I purchased it.  I'm glad I have it, I guess, but I just now purchased the 1980s version and am looking forward to receiving that.<br /><br />The casting was the big surprise.  Mrs. Bennett was the worst of all. She is supposed to be a bit of a boor, but she is so incredibly shrill, it is fathomable that one will have a headache if the film is viewed in its entirety.  I certainly did. As a matter of fact, it's been a few hours after I've finished the movie and I've had several ibuprofin. My head is still aching.  She was so loud! Her voice was an octave higher than this reviewer's ears could comfortably take and I'm truly surprised that the surrounding glass objects survived in one piece rather than shattering.<br /><br />Jane just was not pretty.  I first saw the actress that played Jane play the reporter in House of Cards-- a first rate British drama starring Ian Richardson. My husband and I remarked her likeness to Princess Diana. Yet, she isn't that pretty. She's attractive, but not pretty and definitely not the beauty Jane is supposed to be.  Her neck is freakishly thick and she lacks grace.  In this film, she can't even pass as prettier than average.  At the risk of being just a bit too picayune, had they done something a bit better with her hair-- maybe pulled it less tightly from the back, have the front hang a bit lower, she may have passed as more attractive, but there was nothing about her in the least attractive and I'm more than surprised at the choice of casting here.<br /><br />Lizzie was far prettier if a bit zaftig.  Strangely enough, during the last scene of the first dvd, she was markedly thinner and her collarbones actually protruded a bit. I bet that was the final scene filmed. However, during the rest of both the first dvd and the entire second dvd, she must have weighed 20 pounds more than she probably should have and it showed.  Still, she was very pretty and grew prettier by the time the film was over. But, she seemed a bit older than she should have been and she seemed a bit matronly for the role. Here, I'm not criticizing her weight at all-- by 'matronly', I mean her demeanor. She didn't appear charming or childlike when playing with the dogs or running in the fields. She didn't seem like a young and single woman at almost any time-- she seemed older in demeanor and appearance.<br /><br />Bingley's sister wore WAY too much makeup for her role and looked like  a French courtesan.  I'm shocked at this choice, too. She was the only woman in the entire film to be made up this way and it was a very poor choice.<br /><br />Lydia was absolutely appalling. She lacked even an iota of charm. She is physically unattractive and so entirely annoying to watch.  To get away with what she got away with in the story, there has to be SOMETHING appealing about her and there wasn't anything appealing about her here.  She did not have to be pretty, but she should have been a littlecute-- something.  She was just a disgusting character from beginning to end. Had the actress that played Kitty actually played Lydia, that would have been more successful.<br /><br />Collins was a joke. The Collins in the Keira Knightly version was wonderful. His pretension actually had a bit of charm-- not enough to want to spend any time with him, mind you.  Still, if one is to see these characters in a real light, they have to have some dimension to them. The Collins in this film did not. The Collins in the other film did.<br /><br />The rest of the casting was superb. Crispin Bonham-Carter was perfect as was Colin Firth. When he lost some of his reserve one could truly see the charm under there.  His take on the role was very good.<br /><br />I wonder if I should have waited to review this until after I watch the  80s version I just ordered, but reviewing this one without the benefit of comparison has merit, too, I believe.<br /><br />The newer and less faithful version with Keira Knightly was much more enjoyable, even if liberties were taken. Both Lizzie and Jane were perfectly cast, as were all the sisters.  The mother, as annoying as Mrs. Bennet could possibly be, was at least not repulsive. One didn't absolutely hate her as they did in this version, even if one couldn't find too much likeable about her.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland did not seem too old for this part as I saw mentioned in other reviews. He always appears youthful to me-- even as his hair turns completely gray.  He was very good and likeable as was the father in this version, as well.<br /><br />And, what can I say about Matthew Macfadyen who played Mr. Darcy? He was completely wonderful. Fabulous, really. Colin Firth was good, too, mind you, but Matthew Macfadyen portrayed Mr. Darcy perfectly.<br /><br />The ending in this film was almost superb. Not so in the Keira Knightly version, which seemed completely overdone.  Here, we got a quick view of everyone else in the film before the final scenes with Lizzie, Jane, Darcy and Bingley.  That was perfect as those scenes played out over the sermon given by the pastor.  Perfect ending.eginning to end.

B000002N1E|5.0|Despite earning lots of praise, this flopped badly, and is now quite out-of-print - I finally found it used, for nineteen dollars, which is more than I would normally pay for a new double-album, let alone a used single. But I gotta tell you, it was more than worth it. Oh, sure, it's nothing Prince hasn't done before, and I could've definitely done without the segues. But the songs are so freaking fantastic that those two complaints are insignificant. All Prince's usual trademarks are in attendance: hard-driving funk (\\"P. Control\\", with lyrics so explicit they're not in the lyrics booklet, \\"We March\\", \\"Now\\", \\"319\\"), ballads (the sweetly romantic single \\"Most Beautiful Girl in the World\\", which easily lives up to other ballads like \\"Adore\\" and \\"International Lover\\", the horny slow grind \\"Shhh\\", \\"I Hate U\\", with an admittedly pretentious monolog, the Messianic but brilliant \\"Gold\\", which would probably fit in my top 10-15 Prince songs), and wild rockers (the reincarnation-themed \\"Dolphin\\", \\"Endorphinmachine\\", Prince at his most intense since \\"The Beautiful Ones\\"). And I don't know where to place \\"Shy\\" (country-jazz, I guess), but I like it. Every song has something about it that really makes it wonderful: the screaming and driving beat of \\"Endorphinmachine\\", dazzling guitar soloing on \\"Shhh\\", \\"I Hate U\\", \\"Gold\\", and \\"Dolphin\\", genre-blending psychosis on \\"Shy\\", moving falsetto on \\"Most Beautiful Girl\\", a surprisingly engaging rap on \\"Now\\"... I could go on for ages. Hell, even the trivial \\"Billy Jack B*tch\\" has some pleasant horn playing, even though I find myself rapidly losing patience with whoever decided to shout \\"B*tch!\\" once a measure (because hearing any word repeated once every four beats for six minutes would probably drive you up the wall too). The lyrics are perhaps negligible, covering Prince's usual themes of individuality, spirituality, and (what else?) sex, but strictly judging by tune quality it's debatably Prince's best ever. Other than the segues. Does ANYONE like the segues?ANYONE like the segues?
B000KX0IOA|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Ben Kingsley was the perfect fit to play the legendary Gandhi in this brilliantly produced epic showing the struggle for freedom from imperialism and the resultant emergence of an independent India and Pakistan. This is history in its finest! The only negative side to this movie is Candice Bergen was the wrong person cast for the role of Margaret Bourke-White.  I was also impressed with the bonus CD in which Richard Attenborough and his production team go to great lengths in showing us how the movie was created, including the stunning 'state funeral' of Gandhi that was actually filmed on the very anniversary of his death, and with a claimed record crowd scene of almost half a million people.

B000F3UAFC|3.0|I remember wanting to see this movie for the mere fact that Scarlett Johansson was staring and I totally adore her.  The movie hadn't received the grandest of reviews and so I stayed away until a few weeks back my wife and I decided to rent it.  I must admit that, while I can understand to a degree some of the bad press, it truly is far from a horrible mess.  The film is shockingly engaging and in the end I found that I enjoyed myself my more than I thought I would.<br /><br />Based on Oscar Wilde's play `Lady Windermere's Fan', the film follows a young married couple, the Windermere's, as they settle into their home in Italy.  Young Meg is infatuated with her successful husband Robert and trusts him indefinitely.  That works to her advantage, especially when Mrs. Erlynne moves into town.  Notorious for conniving her way into the lives of married men, the town is obviously up in arms about her arrival.  She quickly becomes the talk of the town.  Meg, having met her, doesn't understand why there is so much gossip to be had, but when it becomes common knowledge that her husband has been spending unnecessary amounts of time with Mrs. Erlynne, even giving her money, she begins to worry for her marriage.<br /><br />There is more to `A Good Woman' then the synopsis that I just provided.  There is much more to Mrs. Erlynne alone than meets the eye.  In fact I never would have guessed how this movie would end, and I think that's why I liked it all the more.<br /><br />One major plus to this film is the marvelous Tom Wilkinson.  His performance as Tuppy, the successful bachelor who tries to woo Mrs. Erlynne for himself, is seriously best in show.  I only wish he had been in every scene.  Wilkinson is always top notch, that's for sure, and here is obviously no exception.  Mark Umbers is rather forgettable as Robert Windermere, but thankfully the film isn't that interested in him aside from a prop character.  The film is much more concentrated on the jealousy building in his wife and the mystery behind Mrs. Erlynne.  Stephen Campbell Moore does a fine job playing Lord Darlington, the young suitor obsessed with having Meg to himself.  His performance, while not award worthy, is memorable and natural.  He has a natural charisma and charm that is befitting.<br /><br />The two female leads are both adequate as well.  Scarlett Johansson, while not giving her finest performance, delivers as Meg a character that is naïve and trusting yet guarded in a way.  By the end of the film she is forced to find herself even if it means falling flat on her face.  She manages to pull this off well.  Helen Hunt, many have jested, is too old for this role.  I agree, yet have to disagree.  I actually really enjoyed her performance.  She looks ancient here, older than she really is, and I found that odd.  You'd think they would have made her look younger for the purposes of the character, but they don't.  Regardless, she nails the performance in my opinion.  I love her chemistry with Wilkinson especially, even if he steals the scenes.<br /><br />In the end I felt that `A Good Woman' was a good movie, one that is rewarding in its own ways.  Sure, it's not phenomenal and it's certainly not the best period piece to come around in recent years, but it manages to deliver a solid 3 ½ star movie that is fun and exciting and something that the whole family can enjoy.ife and the mystery behind Mrs. Erlynne.

B000000WIG|3.0|Gary Moore is a guitar wunderkind performing a rhythm and blues style rock. The guitar solos are amazing in a technical sense but as is often the case gives up soul and feeling in the process. Someone like Stevie Ray Vaughn is able to put it all together, but Moore is not in that league. The vocals are great, and so are the backing musicians. If you want to hear a great guitar player in a blues rock style, Moore will not disappoint. But don't expect nuance and soul.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|The movie was nicely done; a cute and gritty version of boy meets girl with a slightly sad and somewhat hopeful twist on the ending.  I enjoyed it quite a bit though i had never even heard of it before pressing play on the DVD player.    I am NOT a musical guy at all, but this was so well done.  The songs, all of them on the album, feel real and heartfelt.  As Glen Hansard exhorted us to \\"Make art! Make art! Make art!\\" at the Academy Awards we get the feeling upon lisening tot he music that that is what he was after.  A softer but equally emotional version of Jeff Buckley, the music carries a profound emotional appeal.  I was grateful that the Academy in this case, did not reward that schlocky music from Enchantment with an award.  I think it was a victory for indenpendent film and independent music, AND the music on the album is such that you can listen over and over.

I agree with Eric Woods that Pollan fell short in not recommending that people start growing their own food and making space for local farms.      My biggest complaint with the book is that it does not need to be as long as it is. Pollan loves to hear himself ramble and repeat what he has elaborated on before.  I kept thinking as I read the book that there was a lot that could have been edited out.  When I read in the acknowledgements that he had followed his editor from one publisher to another, I knew why.  He loves her because she doesn't cut any of his precious words!
B00003CXDD|3.0|Willow (the movie) could have been a great fantasy film - the effects and characters are there BUT it is ruined by the \\"Object of contention\\" in the plot.  If this had been about an amulet or other desireable object it would be great - instead it is about a baby.  Exactly what children do NOT want, probably something they wish would be gotten-rid-of.    (I understand the director was in a child-custody battle at the time and was obsessed - thus the fatal flaw in this movie).  5-star effects, 1-star because of the flaw, average out to 3-stars.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is one of my top ten favorite films.  Almost a Christian film, although a Hollywood production, because of Alvin C. York's testimony and influence in the film.  The story is mostly a fictionalized plot, except for the actual battle scenes where York captured all those Germans. The real York insisted that those be done just the way it happened with no embellishment (except for the \\"turkey call\\").<br /><br />Gary Cooper gave one of his classic low-key, everyman performances as York. Great cast of supporting players, from the great Walter Brennan down to new-comer Joan Leslie. (Watch \\"This is the Army,\\" which was made a couple years later and see some of the same contract actors from Warner Bros. Studio.)<br /><br />I watch this one over and over and show it to friends and relatives. (My family and I even went camping in middle Tennessee and visited York's grave site and the beautiful little mountain valley he came from.  His home is a state monument.)<br /><br />A great film, with a great cast and a great director, producer, and music director about a great American. Shows what old pre-war Hollywood could do when they did something right.

B000002JSJ|4.0|An oft forgotten album, Led Zeppelin's Presence is, perhaps, their most straight ahead rock n' roll effort, and especially so when compared to its predecessor, the enormous Physical Graffiti, which featured many and varied styles.<br /><br />And in that vein, Presence is a success.  The songs are interesting, if not so towering as those in previous efforts, the instrumental and vocal work is generally well done, and it makes for a good album.  The problem lies in that fact that, with Zeppelin, \\"good\\" is the exception to the rule of \\"great.\\"  In that respect, it may be among Zeppelin's weaker albums (though certainly better than the misguided, synth infused In Through the Out Door).  But a weak Zeppelin album is still better than most other bands' work.  This clearly is.  From the epic \\"Achilles Last Stand,\\" to the slow, guitar driven blues of \\"Tea for One,\\" there aren't any bad songs on Presence.  Rather, it's lack of greatness is derivative of the fact that, unlike all previous Zep albums, it lacks the sheer volume of \\"hits\\" that we have come to expect.<br /><br />But hits do not make an album.  The songs between those hits have to be strong, as well, and the songs here are just that.  It's less experimental, for sure.  Straight blues, bluegrass, folk, and any of the other styles with which Zeppelin experimented aren't in ready supply, here.  But if you want high quality, blues driven rock, then this is a worthwhile album and, in my opinion, would have made a much stronger career ender than In Through the Out Door.

B000VNMMR0|5.0|You would need a pretty good team in place to justify a fourth film in a franchise that hasn't had a new entry in 13 years, and boy, do they ever have one here with director Len Wiseman at the helm.  There's nothing groundbreaking about it; rather, it's a throwback to the action films of the 80's.  Once again, Bruce Willis as John McClane pulls off stunts that would do Captain America proud but with plenty of bruises and blood stains to show for it.  The plot concerns a computer terrorist who has seized control of the United States infrastructure and once it gets going, it's non-stop action from start to finish.  I'm not sure what sets this film apart from so many other action films that just become tiresome before the final explosions detonate, but I found it to be a hugely entertaining adrenaline rush and a more fitting send-off to this character than the tepid \\"Die Hard with a Vengeance.\\"

0156029065|4.0|I'll say that at first I hated this book. I thought many times of giving up and moving on to another one, but I bought it, and I figured that since I paid money for it I might as well read it all the way through.<br /><br />I'm really glad I didn't give up because the second half of Baudolino is really the better half. The first half was so boring and seemingly unnecessary and long-winded. In the second half it really picks up speed and comes together nicely. If you have the patience, I would really recommend this. Despite the heavy handed philosophical diatribe that sometimes clogs up the pace of the story, it really is one of Eco's more accessible books. And it has a nice ending that I wasn't expecting. An Eco for beginners I guess.

0375842209|5.0|Never before in our book group's 11-year history have all our members given unqualified raves to one title.  Bur more importantly, the discussion could have gone on for many more hours than we had available. Any work that turns the Angel Of Death and citizens of Nazi Germany into identifiable characters worth caring about is indeed a triumph.  Even a dedicated non-fiction fan can -- and did -- find this novel a compelling read. Marketed as a \\"young adult\\" book, The Book Thief is more clearly a \\"grown-up\\" novel that teens can get excited about without understanding all its levels of meaning.

0446691437|2.0|The early pages in the book built high expectations.  The first section on Resistance was very good.  Author explains the various forms of Resistance and why it impedes progress and growth.      The second section on combating resistance was less worthy and lacked substance on how to permanently solve the Resistance problem beyond \\"just do it\\" and \\"just stick to it\\" and \\"focus.\\"    The final section (Beyond Resistance - The Higher Realm) took up more than 1/3 of  book - was of little utility for me.  I hoped this time would have been spent expanding on solutions for Resistance.      I did find some nuggets in this book - most in the first Section.  Here's a few:    \\"Are you paralyzed with fear?  That's a good sign.  Fear is good.  Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator.  Fear tells us what we have to do.  Remember our rule of thumb:  The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.\\"    \\"The professional (vs. the amateur) has learned better.  He respects Resistance.  He knows if he caves in today, no matter how plausible the pretext, he'll be twice as likely to cave in tomorrow.\\"    While highly rated by most reviewers (and the reason I bought this book), I'm afraid this book didn't work for me.
0316113506|5.0|I didn't need to read the book to be convinced exercise improves mind, body and soul.  I've experienced it in my own life. Thus I have tried hard to convince others that their depression and fatigue are a result of poor dietary habits and failure to launch out of their chairs.     This book provides clear and convincing support for the author's conclusions. While the scientific jargon is scattered throughout, it is very readable, inspiring and just plain entertaining. I literally could not put it down. I took it into my office where my sedentary and overweight co workers are trying hard to incorporate exercise into their lives. Both were very impressed with the book and are more motivated than ever to 'move on'  This book will save lives, read it!
B000VDDDY6|4.0|Sorry. Couldn't resist. No one else thought to use that since HD DVD died? lol.     Anyway, I broke down and got this at the 50% off marker. I would be more thrilled with this purchase IF the other 2 seasons would be on this format.. yes, I'm sensitive like that. This is a tough call. I'm not really wowed by the picture.. there is often a lot of grain that I didn't expect. The upside is the new effect shots are CRYSTAL CLEAR.. and then.. you get back to the show which varies from shot to shot. I'm surprised they didn't go farther with the effects tinkering; which is generally relegated to ship flyby's and planets, which do look nice but they are all too brief and not much footage. On the other hand I'm glad they didn't butcher up what had come before.    I haven't dug into the extras but I'm sure they are decent. Can't say I'm thrilled with the box design but I do like the \\"art design\\" of the various inserts. The look of the case is also handsome on a shelf but not very practical. Lastly, I could have done without the \\"combo format\\" and knock the price down another 1/3 and some disc art could have made this a 5'er.
B000E5KJD4|1.0|This product was incompatible with my equipment.  When I called Amazon for help I was told that the DVD should play in my equipment and was probably a bad DVD (I had purchased two. One for myself and one as a gift.)Amazon replaced the product with exactly the same product. In my next phone call to Amazon, after I had returned the 2 replacement DVD's, I was told tough luck...no help.  Even though one DVD was returned unopened I was given no refund...my order was considered to be the order that replaced my original order.  Seems I'm out over $40.00 but Amazon is out of one pretty loyal customer who has a fairly good order record over the past years. There are far too many sites where I can order merchandise,get help and be treated fairly.No more Amazon shopping for me.

B000WCDI5K|5.0|I bought Hot Fuss when it first came out, and if it were a record, it would have been played to pieces by now.  I was disappointed in the first whispers of Sam's Town and so didn't buy it, but my love of Brandon Flowers' vocals drove me to pick up Sawdust over the weekend.    I didn't realize when I picked it up that it was a comp/B-sides album, and as I started to listen to it, I immediately loved it.  The songs on here have a different feel-- unpolished, as they should be for an album from the cutting room floor, and a much better feel than Sam's Town or even, in places, Hot Fuss.      The song that sold me was \\"Leave the Bourbon On the Shelf\\", which is sure to hook a listener, but as I listened through the whole album, I found more treasures just than that.    I was mildly disappointed in \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" simply because it is so like the original, but I think that's one song not to be tinkered with, and the remake of \\"Mr. Brightside\\" offered me nothing I didn't already know or love.  But the rest of this cd is amazing, and definitely good enough to stand on its own.
0316010669|1.0|Although many people does make decisions quickly and those decisions appear to come out of thin air, the author omit the fact that many of them may not want others to know why they make those decisions. Those intuition all based on many years experience and logic deduction, and the only way to be able to make those seemingly blink decision is to immerse yourself into the relevant environment and make many decisions based on facts and logics, eventually, you will be able to reach the level of making quick and correct decision without a lot of pondering.

B000P0I4O4|2.0|As we watched this movie, we kept asking ourselves outloud... what the heck are Morgan Freeman and John Cusack doing in this film?  This movie's writing smells of a bad 1980s made-for-tv thriller.  I can't imagine how two of the best actors in Hollywood could have paired up in a movie that I found so disapointing.  In most cases, these guys would carry even the weakest of movies and, to a small degree they do here, but it's just too poorly written and produced to recover.  The rest of the casting also seems way off - maybe they're good actors but they have all been caught in a pretty awful movie.  Forget for a moment the bad writing and awkward dialouge, the post-production was the worst I've seen in a major movie in a long time.  There is one scene where a helicopter crashes and I could swear I was watching an episode of Dukes of Hazzard or something - cheesey slow-mo crash!  Oh well.

0525950079|5.0|I am not finished with this book.  I find this book great maybe not like the first but it is still a great work of fiction.   I like the fact he is sticking to the same theme and has the strong women etc.  too many villians to keep track of and say wow I have a fave villian I want dead like William of Hamley I wanted dead asap and loved how mr follett kept him alive until almost the end of book and how he tied it altogether.  Hopefully this book does the same.  I think I am not far enough into it to make a raving decision as mr follett is still laying the foundation even into two hundred pages.  This book is a bit longer then the other one but still a page turner maybe the charm of the first one sort of wore off for this one as I am reading these two books back to back.  I just discovered the pillars of the earth from Oprahs book club.    I wish they would make a movie out of both of these books especially the first one.  please make one!  teresa

0375714839|5.0|Last weekend I had the joy of seeing the film adaptation of the comic book series PERSEPOLIS by Marjane Satrapi. I loved the film. I knew though that I was missing out some key points of Marjane's life so I decided to check out the complete version of PERSEPOLIS in paperback. Although the book is in the form of a graphic novel, the story is a memoir of Marjane Satrapi's life growing up in Iran as well as outside of Iran. I also got the impression that the story is a love letter to Marjane's late grandmother who was a huge influence on Marjane as a young woman. People can nitpick at the details of life in Iran during and after the reign of the Shah that Marjane has written in the book but lets keep this in perspective that this book is not a tome on Iran but an autobiography told from the personal point of view from the author. She told what life was like in Iran through her young, impressionable eyes.<br /><br />Like the Oscar-nominated film, PERSEPOLIS is told with a lot of humor, sadness, and often anger. I could not put the book down. I found myself deeply engrossed in Marjane's life as as child as well as an adult. I enjoyed the animation. I liked how fluid the shapes of the characters flowed. If you have seen the film adaptation of PERSEPOLIS, the book version is definitely worth reading. There is quite a bit of information from Marjane's life that just couldn't fit into the time constraints of the film.

B000Y179KO|1.0|I consider myself to be an Eagles FANatic. I own every album they've ever made, and I love to hear their music, with the exception of this album. I have to tell you this 2 disk set stinks to high heaven in comparison to any other album they've ever made. Yes, the Eagles classic harmonies are there, but there's no life in any of the cuts. With the exception of maybe one or two songs, I found them to be as exciting, and entertaining as eating cardboard. Overall, the album  is lifeless, with little to no real SPIRIT, excitement, or emotion. If this is all the creativity this dream team can muster we Eagles fans are in for big disappointment.

B000JLSVH4|5.0|My Chemical Romance are an awesome group. They come from my neighbor state, New Jersey, and they are simply amazing. Gerard Way is an awesome singer, with a powerful punk voice.    (First, before I begin my review, I do not have this extra tracks edition. I have the regular version that's in stores across the country.)    The songs 'Teenagers,' 'This Is How I Disappear,' and 'Welcome To The Black Parade' appear on the radio frequently. Those are the three highlights. 'This Is How I Disappear' actually appears on the video game 'MLB '07: The Show.'    'Famous Last Words,' actually, is an excellent track. 'The Sharpest Lives' is another great track that should get more radio airplay. 'The End.' is a well composed track, with blazing lyrics from Way.    So, if you don't already own this, than get it. You won't be disappointed. This is one of the finest punk records since Green Day's 2004 epic 'American Idiot,' from Green Day.     Highly recommended for the punk fan. ENJOY!!!
1401207928|4.0|V FOR VENDETTA is Alan Moore and David Lloyd's comic book vision of future, dystopian England, where the fascist government is oppost by an anarchist terrorist.<br /><br />The comic is considerably more complex than the film; V is crusading for anarchy, not freedom, and neither he nor Evey Hammond are as particularly noble as they are in the movie. This leads, then, as Moore intended, to the reader dealing with two extremes, neither one of which is perfect or necessarily even good.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is a solid, thought-provoking work, although not Moore's absolute best (Watchmen). The narrative is heavy-handed at times, particularly at the beginning. There are some instances where the reader's suspension of disbelief is stretched rather thin (for example, how, exactly, did V come to have complete control over the Fate computer all these years?). The authors' decision not to use thought balloons or sound effects was avante garde, but ultimately benefits this work. Lloyd's art is on the whole quite realistic, which fits the story very well.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is recommended to those who enjoy thought-provoking, multi-layered stories.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED

B00008PW3Q|4.0|You know, if Fleetwood Mac  had thrown in the towel when everyone said they should, the band would have died 30 years ago. That's how many times the critics and \\"fans\\" have left them for dead. Face the facts...this is one band that will never really go away. Since 1967 there has been a band called Fleetwood Mac. Sure, they've taken long vacations from each other, and they have seen people come and go, but somehow or other, they always seem to come back, in one form or another. Sometimes without Lindsey Buckingham, sometimes without Stevie Nicks, sometimes without either. This time, they came back without Christine McVie. But you know, every version of this band has had something to offer, and every version of the band, and every album should be counted. If time has taught us anything about Fleetwood Mac, it's that they should never be counted out and left for dead. They will surprise you.

B00140PK6O|5.0|What a wonderful, rich and cozy experience, but you'll have to wait and see what the cat does with the lace. It's the funniest bit I have seen in a BBC film yet! While this film has not been shown on American TV as yet I was lucky enough to stumble across the entire film on youtube where it was  shown in 9 minute segments. Its a quiet film with rich and wonderful characters long remembered. I was afraid that Judi Dench would overpower her role but nothing like it. She was perfect in her poignantly sad but joyfully rising role. It's about the town Cranford, that is fearful of changes being brought by the arrival of the railway. No one of course wants the charm of Old English ways to change and one gets very attached to the warm and sad and silly and funny characters in  Cranford. Cranford really is a place one wishes to live and to never leave nor have change. I loved it, anglophile that I am, so this is a creation made just for me and I can't wait to own it when it is released. Another beautiful English costume romance by the people who really know how to do it well!! BRAVO!!!

0800141601|4.0|The '95 film `First Knight' is a romantic and adventurous reinventing of the timeless tale of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. As already mentioned in several previous reviews, the script takes a very different approach to the subject matter than one would expect. There are no personal appearances nor mention of Merlin, Morgan le Fay, or Mordred. Even more unexpected is the manner in which the identities of the 'Knights of the Round Table' remain anonymous.<br /><br />As if that wasn't enough to send the Arthurian purist screaming into the night there are more surprises ahead. You will find no Holy Grail, no pagan deities or prophetic utterances and no mention whatsoever of the sword Excalibur in this film. When all is said and done the movie resembles the '38 classic `The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" more than anything else.<br /><br />Oddly enough, in eliminating the usual esoteric elements long associated with Gnostic Christianity and Celtic paganism the developers of the film saw fit to replace the time honored storyline and symbols with a strong, more traditional Christian allegorical subtext. Relying heavily on the vivid, literary themes and imagery found in John Milton's 'Paradise Lost' and Dante Aligheri's 'Divine Comedy' the film centers on the ages old battle waged between good and evil, the war between God and the rebellious Lucifer, once the greatest of all the heavenly host.<br /><br />Ben Cross does a superb job of exploring the persona of Lucifer in the role of Malagant, the \\"first knight\\" (hence the title of the film). Now banished from the hallowed walls of Arthur's realm, Malagant (i.e.: malignant, maligned) is definitely the embodiment of the \\"Great Adversary\\" bent on overthrowing the ideals of Camelot (Heaven) and its fatherly ruler King Arthur (God). As he waits impatiently for the right moment to attack, this black armored knight dwells with his followers in a dark, dank fortress appearing more cavern than castle. The passageways within his abode are poorly lit with an occasional torch here and there. This nocturnal environment was most certainly designed to conjure images of a Dantesque Hell.<br /><br />This suggested association of Malagant with the Luciferian archetype is made crystal clear when he makes a dramatic appearance before King Arthur and his knights during a Round Table gathering. In true Milton fashion his arrogant demeanor and boastful rhetoric are straight out of `Paradise Lost'.<br /><br />While `First Knight' lacks the depth and substance the more mythical Grail elements would have supplied, the loss is more than made up for with a tender romance acted out beautifully by Richard Gere (Lancelot) and Julia Ormond (Guinivere). The two forlorn lovers are perfectly matched. Gere is at his best, delivering in my estimation his most memorable film performance and Julia is mezmerizing as the strong-willed, yet hesitant Queen of Camelot. Not one to miss the obvious, Julia looks absolutely beautiful which always helps to maintain the complete, undivided attention of the males in the audience.<br /><br />I certainly wouldn't consider this to be the definitive Arthurian film, but it's certainly an enjoyable one. I could watch 'First Knight' over and over again and when all is said and done isn't the repeatability factor the litmus test for any movie?<br /><br />My Rating: -4 ½ Stars-.y lit with an occasional torch here and there.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|i missed this film on the big screen, but caught it on cable, and it was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time...better than \\"atonement\\" or \\"no country for old men\\", i loved this movie...it was really ignored by the academy and it deserves more recognition...it is close to a perfect movie...it blends action, drama, comedy, sci-fi, and suspense very well...it is fantasy, and offers relevant social commentary at the same time...it also offers some spiritual context to be considered.    check it out...
B000002UB6|3.0|It is difficult to criticise this album, as it was never really produced the way the Beatles wanted it. Moreover, many of the songs don't have the live feel the Beatles wanted (even without the overdubs) they just sound unfinished. 'The long and winding road' is a gorgeous Beatles song, but a proper definitive version was never released. Take the version without the strings, a badly recorded bass part, it just is not complete. Same for 'I me mine' an incomplete song, edited together, so it appears longer. They never got 'Across the universe' right either, although it is a lovely song. 'I dig a pony' sounds like a demo of a song pattern, undeveloped and merely repeated.   Judged as a bunch of demos, Lennon's material is lacking. 'I dig a pony' is his only new song to the record, the other contributions being a small part of 'I've got a feeling' and older songs regurgitated for this project. Paul shines with five new recordings and they clearly are the highlight of the record, although some are incomplete.
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|It was a pleasant surprise to hear the original music from Joshua Radin.  His sound is tranquil with beautiful harmonies, and  little reminiscent of the Simon and Garfunkel days.  Great for THIS young boomer (AND the cats loved it, too!)
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Great series. Too bad it was only on for 1 season. Definitely ahead of it's time.
B00109T5WY|3.0|This is fairly slow even in the post rock genre and i have purchased their EP as well and i admit that their EP is superior to this after a few listens. Its not bad but i was expecting more. To those new or newer to the Post Metal/Rock scene i suggest Red Sparowes or Rosetta who are superior IMO.
B0011HOEY4|2.0|Wish I had seen the American Gangster on the big screen.  I would have asked for my money back - it was boring.  My review: slow and predictable - Bang-Boring!
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Usually, in any trilogy, there is a serious dog.  The exceptions are so rare - like Lord of the Rings - and this is perhaps the only other one that I know that is near uniformly excellent.  While some of it began to appear formulaic, every detail added to the story's complexity and its believability.  OK, there are wonderful car chases with mercy at the end, stupid CIA brute bosses, and incredible feats of agility without injury.  Nonetheless, there is a psychological realism that is undeniable and palpable, at least for me, while Bourne keeps a step ahead of all his adversaires.  Damon is one of the best actors I have ever seen.  He is seeking something, has found his ethical values, and will only kill when he cannot avoid it for reasons of survival.<br /><br />The plot details are very fun.  At the end of Bourne 2, it appears that he is back and can make his own way relatively unmolested.  Then, we see in this film that this was an illusion - he had a long adventure to reach that point (a full 2/3 thirds of the film!) and had to complete the search for his identity at grave risk.  Indeed, the film takes up minutes after he left the apartment of the girl to whom he apologized in Moscow.<br /><br />There are many wonderful plot twists, such as who helps him and why, and the outcomes are splendidly ambiguous and to a degree unexplained.  Only a portion of it gets tied off at the end, with many loose ends dangling and frayed.  That leaves space for the imagination, that the viewer must fill in, which for fans like me is a delightful treat.  In addition, the film is timely in this zealous age for its over-zealous CIA operatives run amok.  There are certain works of fiction that are so good that they  become fixtures in the imagination.  Happily, the plot never degenerates into a Hollywood happy ending - it is dark and unresolved right to the end.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  This is first rate entertainment.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|This latest release from Paramore shows that they not only are here to stay, but keep getting better and better.  Way to ROCK Haylay & Co!  Not many bands put out an album where I like every single song on it!
B0000X2DMA|4.0|This is a fantastic album and an absolutely incredible mixture of symphonic  opera choir and heavy metal. It blends so well together it is impossible for mere words to do it justice. This band is incredible for people who are serious about their music.
0452289963|5.0|This book has come along at just the right time in my life. I have just spent the past three years researching my own suffering. I too had had a personally cataclysmic experience that made me stop everything I was doing and begin seeking the answers I did not have.  It happened that a \\"pain body\\" experience to use Tolle's words occurred in the very spot my earliest \\"pain body\\" experience had occurred nearly forty years earlier this time with my daughter instead of with my mother.  It was then that I knew that with out under standing I was doom to repeat the same suffer of my past over and over. Relocating to my dream home that prior year I envisioned peace and serenity and found I had just exactly what I was trying to distance myself from.  Each time I found a book that touched on my \\"pain body\\" stuff I shared it with my family. My search brought me back to the Anonymous fellowship, which had sparked some recovery in me over twenty-eight years ago.  Although I had been released from my destructive behavior for years I had not become happy joyous and free as promised or at least I didn't think that I had.  After listening to \\"A New Earth\\" I have come to see that like Dorothy in the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" I had it all along. I was just too busy fighting off what Eckhart Tolle calls the \\"ego voice\\" inside myself to stop and smell the roses. Actually I think that this book could be called enlightenment or spiritual experience for dummies. I became frustrated with the \\"Holy Bible\\" years and years ago because it had to be interpreted for me. I had similar experiences with \\"The Course In Miracles\\". I didn't much like having that Christianity philosophy served up again and used as examples of scripture talking about enlightenment in this book. It was like \\"On No! here we go again\\". If I will be last I will be first?  That is an ego game to me. I didn't get it then and it didn't make anymore since today. I just recognized that wanting was a precursor to suffering.  Eckhart Tolle points out Buddha, Tao and Jesus' teachings as examples of wide spread spiritualism. He would include Bill W. and Dr. Bob if he knew about them.  Their book \\"Alcoholics Anonymous\\" is published in many languages too and it has only been in print for around fifty years. It too simplifies the surrender of the ego and finding true peace of mind. Something terribly distressing has to happen to make the process applicable.  Where I failed to make the leap was in continually mucking around in the past trying to figure out why I could not get free of the fear and anxiety and what I now describe as the \\"pain body experiences\\" of the past repeating its self in the present which it did. Why I was still angry and volatile.  Having listened to Eckhart Tolle a couple times I think that I see my way now and have already begun being aware of basking in the warmth of  my personnel peace and serenity.  After nearly three years of seeking I have come to enjoy this subject very much and I plan to read some of the books other reviewers have suggested as companions to this one. In the beginning of my quest I had planned to find out what was at the core of my suffering get over it once and for all and get on with my life.  This subject has now become my life, sharing the possibility of this \\"peace that passes all understanding\\" with others. If you have reached the point in your own quest for self understand that I have and Tolle has you will understand enough from this book to complete the transition from daily suffering to daily peace. I have.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|What is not to love? Austen's story line (well, as much as they ever put in movies) and Gwyneth's acting make this film delightful.
1417647019|5.0|This is an excellent book that's full of valuable, plain-spoken advice. The autobiographical parts of the book all focus on writing, so that it's something like looking over the shoulder of a successful writer and seeing how their life affects their writing. The direct advice parts are very no-nonsense, easy to understand, and easy to apply to your own work. Not only is the book useful; it's entertaining too. It's written in a candid, funny manner that makes it enjoyable to read. I highly recommend this book for anyone, especially any writer or would-be writer.
B0000640VN|2.0|Rented this on a friend's recommendation.  Currently re-assessing whether or not this person is a true friend.  Loved Hugh Jackman & the brother.  Plot was predictable, but bearable.  What was not predictable was and aging, sad-looking woman with a mean outlook on life somehow attracting & forming a bond with a man from the 1800's.  Who wrote this?  I'd believe a romance between Ann Coulter & an Amish man before I'd believe this one.  Meg Ryan, please quit trying to convince us that you are a hip, feminist career woman in your late twenties--you are not and you look sad and pathetic trying to be one.  You are an excellent actor, but not when you try to stuff yourself into the same tired old box that made you a star.  Hugh Jackman is a wonderful Duke, and I would gladly tango with him, but what woman of today would EVER, EVER, EVER want to go back in time to the Victorian era and GIVE BIRTH THERE?  A man wrote this story!  Don't waste your time on this movie.  By the way, her ex-boyfriend looks amazingly like a prairie dog, doesn't he?
B000P6YNSE|5.0|For any fan of the show, the Third Season on DVD is a must have.
B000HEWEE4|1.0|I just wanted an enjoyable movie to relax with over the weekend--I love Sandra Bullock, so I checked this one out at the library.  Now I'm going nuts trying to figure out how the writers could ever rationalize the time paradox they created when they set up the scenario for this movie.  Hello?  If she saves the man whose death catapulted her into a bunch of major life changes, then she will never have the event that made her make the changes that led to her having a romance through time with the man who died!  Duh?  When she's listing her favorite things during one of the stereotypical scenes, she lists the smell of her dog's feet--how gross is that?  How many people come home at the end of a long, tiring day & relax by sniffing their dog's feet?  And finally, she treats her long-suffering boyfriend like a piece of crap.  He keeps coming around, treating her nicely, trying to get her involved in the relationship but she goes glomming off & making out with random people or sighing over a guy she's never actually met.  Both of the relationships she has are about as hot as a wet toast.  Thank God there are other, more enjoyable light movies out there.  Based on this, I would think that romance was a date to lick stamps together and that Sandra & Keanu should quit acting and get jobs at the local hardware store stocking shelves.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|This focus of this film is on the morning of Sunday, December 7th, 1941, the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />This movie is outstanding... just superb. You won't find better action footage in any WW II film and there's plenty of it too! We (Americans) clearly got our behinds tromped during the Pearl Harbor invasion but, because this is an American film, that facet of actuality is slightly played down, (micro victories by individuals are featured to counter our overall demise), as is Roosevelt's alleged desire to enter the war minimized, (my 90 year-old aunt asserts that FDR was Satan himself, I think mostly due to how our family members, during the conflict, were fruitlessly lost and suffered as POWs).<br /><br />In any event, the scenes herein shift between Washington D.C. political activities and those of the Pearl Harbor principals. Of course, the Japanese planning and action sequences are similarly featured.<br /><br />The film is shot in letterbox and runs 144 minutes in length. Excellent color saturation, with great casting (bulging with big period stars), top scenery, believeable script, 70 mm cinematography, and awesome sets all contribute to the aggregate success of this exceptional film. It's all very realistic and not hokey in any sense. A lot of the footage, where the Japanese are speaking, is subtitled in English but it's well-done and not at all distracting. Compare it to the German subtitles in \\"The Longest Day\\".<br /><br />I can't convey enough good comments about this movie. If you are even just a casual movie viewer of common genres, you'll probably much enjoy this well-made historical film, albeit some dramatic artistic license was tastefully invoked by the directors, Richard Fleischer, Kinji Fukasaku, and Toshio Masuda .<br /><br />I do recommend that you have the movie \\"Midway,\\" (a sort of historic Act II), ready at hand to watch following \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" the former of which is a similarly fine film.

0735619670|5.0|I'm currently studying computer science and have been reading this in my spare time. Skip your lectures. Just read this book! If you want to construct software in a timely, efficient, and complete manner--this is the definitive book to read. Not dry at all, Steve McConnell covers topics for all experience levels. Even if you're an experienced programmer, you will learn something from this great piece of literature.    I've only gone through the first few chapters thus far. So pending finishing my reading, I'll update this review. Unfortunately this might never happen as I find myself re-reading portions of the book to pick up new ideas and details for software construction!
B000WC3A0S|4.0|Its exactly what you would expect: all 6 movies and no extras, no commentaries, no bonuses, JUST the movies. So if you waited for a good deal like I did, then its the set for you. If you want a Special Edition, then its not for you.
B000F8AF70|1.0|Horrible audio and video quality, appears to be a VHS ripped to dvd by an amateur dvd author. The most ugly dvd menus I've ever seen. Edited concert, this is not a full GNR concert. Conclusion, If download any live concert, burn it to dvd, probably you will obtain a better dvd quality than this dvd
B000002UJQ|5.0|While my taste in music varies wildly from Classical to Jazz to Metal, one album that I find myself constantly returning to is OK Computer.  I listen to Radiohead in general a great deal but OK Computer is thier best release in my opinion.  My favorite tracks on the album are Lucky and Paranoid Android.      There are a few albums and books that I push on all my friends and family and this is one of them.  Seriously, do what you have to in order to hear this music if you haven't already.  It could change your life.
0553805460|2.0|Living on Long Island I have heard of Stratton Oakmont. I was intrigued as to how it was started and how such a young man could influence so many people. The book jumps around a lot and really didnt hit on points in which I felt would of been most interesting such as how he started and built the firm - the book jumps from Jordan being a rookie broker directly to and already established multi-millionare firm owner. Also, what actually happended with the \\"dutchess\\" that ultimately led to his divorce and his kids. I would of also liked to know more about him in the present time - what he is doing with his life and where all the money had gone. And how it feels having the money and power that he did and losing it all and being average again.    All in all it was a just okay book and I was expecting a lot more.

B000GG4ZBI|3.0|In her novel, Mutant Message Down Under, Marlo Morgan creates a small tribe of perfect people, perfectly connected to the environment, each other, and their creator. Theses people, called \\"Real People,\\" are modeled after the Aboriginal peoples of Australia and Marlo, the protagonist is invited on a walk-about where she learns what the world, addictions, selfishness, and her others sins have done to the harmony she could share with God but is missing because of the things she previously chose to hold on to.<br /><br />Mutant Message Down Under comes packed with controversy. Is the story real? Did she fake the entire thing? Is she misrepresenting the religion of the Aboriginal people? I don't really know; I read it as it is--a novel, a work of fiction. In addition, groups of new-agers and metaphysical religions have gravitated to this novel. For what reason I'm unsure, but I think it might have something to do with the connection to nature and to one another. (It might also be connected with a passage about the Real People not needing Jesus' message because they are still in union with the Creator. Ironically, this is especially true of Christianity. Like the book points out, none-except the Real People in the book-are free of sin and remain connected to God, or as the book calls the creator, Oneness. Therefore, using the book as an explanation not to need Jesus' message makes little sense.)<br /><br />I enjoyed this book because of Morgan's ability to capture what faith feels like. On the walkabout, the walkers had to depend on the land, each other, and a higher power for everything. There was no self. Nothing could be accomplished until the self was let go. Only then could perfect faith grow.<br /><br />I found the environment points interesting. In 2007, it's cool to reduce our ecological footprint on the earth; but in 1991, the ideas in the book might have been a little far on the fringe. Maybe Morgan was ahead of her time.<br /><br />Parts of the book almost seem silly, but the book remains enjoyable and thought provoking.oyable and thought provoking.
B000002UWF|1.0|There is no other as talented and timeless as Luis Prima, and this is an amazing collection.  However, the CD only plays some of the time and in some CD players...it never does.  It is very frustrating!  Why bother buying this if you can't enjoy it?
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Definitely a must for all Blade Runner fans. I was unwilling to spend the money for the briefcase just to have a movie that I couldn't store with my others.

B001041JKU|5.0|Listening to \\"Thriller\\" some 25 years on is still a stunning experience. Michael Jackson sold so many of these albums before the backlash set in (and [[ASIN:B000002GVS Eagles - Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975]] overtook \\"Thriller\\") that everywhere you went, a Michael Jackson song was likely playing from 1983 through 1984. As an example, the first Top 40 Radio station I worked for (in 1983) had both \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Billie Jean\\" in its top ten, with \\"The Girl is Mine\\" and \\"Thriller\\" (even before it was a single) in rotation, plus an album cut from a Michael Jackson/Steven Spielberg E.T. related special album. Not to forget every record Michael had a hand in (Rockwell, anyone?). That meant at least one song from Michael was going to come up per half hour, and maybe more. Jackson single handedly rewrote the rules when \\"Thriller\\" became a phenomenon.<br /><br />More examples. Prior to \\"Thriller,\\" the idea of more than two singles from an album was pooh-poohed, it was considered a way to kill album sales. When Jackson dropped four singles from [[ASIN:B00005QGAT Off the Wall]], it was considered to be a fluke occurrence. Seven of the nine songs here charted as top ten hits, two as number ones. Jackson wove multiple-musical threads into his tapestry, which meant that Eddie VanHalen was on board to rock \\"Beat It\\" and Paul McCartney was there to bring on board the Adult Contemporary crowd with a cheesy pop-duet ballad. VanHalen forced \\"Thriller\\" onto rock stations (which went as far as refusing to introduce the artist or say the record was Eddie VanHalen with Michael Jackson), and the funk of \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Starting Something\\" made this a club savvy smash.<br /><br />Oddly, it is \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\" that give the first clues into the freak show that Jackson would eventually devolve into...both paranoid and obsessive, these songs both broach Jackson's Us Vs Them psyche to come. As he sings \\"You're a vegetable, they hate you, they eat off you, you're just a buffet, you're a vegetable,\\" one wonders what made this and \\"Billie Jean\\" so venomous. But that throbbing bass and the moonwalk performance (on the DVD!) sealed the deal. Add MTV to the mix and there was no stopping him. The demand was so great that a cottage industry in Michael Jackson imitators started touring to fill the demand.<br /><br />Yet 25 years and some 40 million sold LP/CD/downloads later, what of the music? Quincy Jones was an immaculate producer...this remaster proves just how pristine \\"Thriller's\\" pop was. The staccato strings in \\"Something,\\" the throb of \\"Billie Jean,\\" the smooth soul of \\"Human Nature\\"... there is hardly a bad sounding moment on the album. Granted, the title track is probably the song that has held up the worst and maybe the chipmunk voices on \\"PYT\\" rank second, but this album is a textbook example on just how to engineer and produce great music. One needs merely to listen to the bonus tracks to catch that.<br /><br />After all, why fuzz up \\"The Girl Is Mine?\\" Will.I.Am should left well enough alone. Barking out a new rap instead of McCartney's playfully cloy counterpart just sounds like a forced fit. Fergie adds nothing to \\"Beat It\\" other than bad karaoke. Akon and Kanye West at least make it sound relevant...but when you listen to the smoothness of Quincy Jones' work on \\"Billie Jean\\" as juxtaposed to the ragged sound of Kanye...well, you realize that West still has a long way to go. The lone original new track, \\"For All Time,\\" sounds like it should have been there to start with (and in the CD era, probably would have).<br /><br />Having lost \\"Thriller\\" from my collection a long time back, I decided to go back for the new version. It was totally worth it. While every era has records that define it, \\"Thriller\\" not only captured the time it was released, but boldly restructured what the future of pop would be.a buffet, you're a vegetable,\\" one wonders what made this and \\"Billie Jean\\" so venomous.

B000VECAC6|4.0|I'll assume everyone can find a review of the movie itself, and skip straight to this edition's features.     The special features were fun and entertaining, but having been spoiled by Python's special edition releases of their other films, this one comes up a little short. Though what's there (an hour featurette, the original read through of the script [with animations by Gilliam]commentary) is excellent, and the film transfer is good, it lacks all the fun bits found on the Holy Grail or the Meaning of Life special editions.    However, its the only game in town, it's an excellent film, and a great disc.

You'll find much of what you believe validated, learn some new things, and have old lessons hammered home.  Quite frankly, it's probably one of the best books on writing out there.<br /><br />Stephen King often gets dismissed.  This is mainly because his books sell ... well.  He knows how to tell a story, and he loves doing it. That love comes through on every page of this book, and the price you pay for it is a fraction of what it is worth.

The supplimental (2nd) cd has some interesting tracks, including Joshua tree B-sides, and unfinished songs that didn't make the final cut, such as my favorite DESERT OF OUR LOVE.  However, I would have been very interested to hear early/rough versions of the finished songs, too, and unfortunately there is nothing like that in this collection.  Still, I recommend this set especially to U2 collectors and fans of the Joshua Tree album.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This band is one of the greatest ever. And I'm not being one of those \\"I love MCR 24 hrs a days kind of fan\\" but I really do think that cd is one of my chemical romance's best cds ever. I have listned to it over and over and over again that I never get tired of all the songs on here. I love this cd and the other cds my chemical romance has made. I hope that they continue to make more cds and to continue to not care what other people have to say about them. I would really recommend this cd to my friends if they listened to rock but since most of them don't I would really recommend this cd to everyone else.
B000OVLNII|5.0|It's sometimes hard to imagine how anything more could be written about Abraham Lincoln and his times. Yet each generation of Americans struggles with the events surrounding the American Civil War, probably the most painful and defining period in our history. As the conscience of the nation matures, and the passions of the past cool, we are able to see the events and personages of this tumultuous period with new eyes. DKG's \\"Team of Rivals\\" (ToR) is a worthy entrant in this generation's efforts to make sense of the way our nation nearly tore itself apart under the centripetal forces surrounding the slavery issue.<br /><br />Goodwin describes the period from about 1830 to 1865 from the perspective of Abraham Lincoln and his three rivals in the 1860 presidential race. Salmon Chase, Henry Seward and John Bates all felt themselves to be the best candidate for the role of chief executive. Goodwin uses their wait for the results of the Republican convention as the starting point for her study of the characters of each man and for an exposition of the forces that led toward antagonism and war. ToR is not written as hagiography. Each man's weaknesses and strengths is on full display. Seward is the driven politician whose lack of attention to personal matters nearly allows a rival to seduce his wife. Chase is stolid, appallingly self-righteous and devastated over the early deaths of not one, but three young wives; Bates is content to allow domestic concerns (he had 17 children!) blanket his smoldering ambitions. Lincoln is clumsy, oafish around women and prone to what others see as maddening indecision; but he possesses a brilliant mind and overpowering political ambitions. Indeed, it DKG's intention to portray Lincoln as something that many of his contemporaries did not see -- as a sly and subtle political operator -- with a genius for making decisions that kept his larger goals (personal and public) always in mind.<br /><br />It's the political Lincoln that is the most fun to watch. If you are committed to maintaining the gauzy mythology of Old Father Abraham, sitting around telling tame jokes while the presidency somehow fell into his lap, prepare for a shock. Goodwin's Lincoln is an empathic joke-teller to be sure. But he is also a man powerfully affected by the deaths of beloved women in his life, almost flattened emotionally by the passing of his true love, Ann Rutledge. Taking advantages of openings provided by his rivals, Lincoln engineers an ever-widening national popularity and reputation. His enormous ambition, coupled with nearly superhuman self-control, allowed him to smooth his way past his rivals -- some of whom had the greatest disdain for him personally. Hiding under the cover of his own homeliness and rusticity, he subtly moved the levers of his party -- both personally through his letters and through his surrogates and associates -- in a way that his competitors never perceived. His ability to stake out a centrist platform at the Republican party -- one which offended no one -- allowed him to gain delegates at the party convention when it became clear that his more strident opponents could not capture the majority they needed to become the nominee.<br /><br />To read \\"Team of Rivals\\" is to gain a better appreciation of the pressures and issues that bedeviled the United States in the mid 19th century. The major personalities all make an appearance -- Steven Douglass, Henry Seward, Frederick Douglass, Edwin Stanton, George McClellan and more. The major themes of the period are discussed -- slavery, southern paranoia, radical abolitionism, expansion of slavery into new territories. And the great legislative achievements and disasters -- Dred Scott, Kansas-Nebraska, etc. -- are described in a way that allows their full impact to be felt. Watching the two sides eagerly plunge closer and closer to civil war is maddening -- indeed, it's hard to see why the participants thought they could forestall the rupture. But the storylends logic and plausibility to this insane and terrible outcome. But always, it is Abraham Lincoln who is most compelling -- the master politician whyo kept his nation together through his personal charm, magnanimity and enormous strength of character.<br /><br />DKG is a wonderful storyteller and has found precisely the right level of detail to tell this wide-ranging story. She relies heavily on primary documents -- the trove of letters, speeches and diaries left by the participants -- letting the participants tell the story in their own words. What carries the narrative along is the raw emotion of the time, in which the great human passions were on display in their most electric form. DKG's telling of the shadow of disease and death that hovered over the period makes the reader wonder how people got up in the morning -- never mind fight a fratricidal war and have enough emotional stability to power their political passions. The story of the death of Lincoln's children is particularly moving.<br /><br />While entire volumes can be (and have been) written about any one of her chapters, DKG manages to keep the story moving along while providing the insight and clarity needed to understand the period and its players.

B000Y8GFY8|4.0|When I heard \\"A&E\\", the first single from the album, I wasn't sure whether I liked it or not. Then, once I listened to the song within the context of the rest of the album, and it seemed to fit perfectly. Alison Goldfrapp's voice has been incredible, from their first album on, but 'Seventh Tree' seems to have refined the musical atmosphere to better incorporate it, making both fit together in harmony.     This reminds me a lot more of [[ASIN:B00004XSS2 Felt Mountain]], than either [[ASIN:B00008XERP Black Cherry]] or [[ASIN:B000EGDC14 Supernature]], though 'Seventh Tree' sounds warmer and more personal. The similarity between the two is mostly in the overall depth and expansive landscape of the songs. Present, as well, is that drifting-on-clouds vibe that carries many of the songs from beginning to end which has been present on all of them. However, while the others were mostly comprised of cool, danceable music, both 'Felt Mountain' and 'Seventh Tree' just allow themselves to be lovely and simple, though, of course, there are obviously some complicated things going on, upon closer inspection.     It's hard for me to pick favorite tracks, since they all flow so well together, but I'd probably settle on \\"Cologne Cerrone Houdini\\", \\"Little Bird\\" and \\"Happiness\\". This album has moments where it's hard to imagine that the sounds generated by the keyboards are actually electronic in any way, since they seem so natural and earthy here, more so than any of their previous releases.  Some fans of their previous work might be turned off by the slow pace 'Seventh Tree', as I was initially. I still find that, isolated, a few of the songs on here aren't as strong as the whole. 'Seventh Tree' is the flip-side of the glitz and glamour of 'Supernature', and almost Zen-like in it's tranquility. Each of Goldfrapp's albums (and individual songs) have been fantastic pictures of the evolution of their unique sound. Just as I've finished listening to 'Seventh Tree', I already can't wait to hear their next album!

0316067598|5.0|When I read Marcus Luttrel's story, I gained full appreciation for what our military accomplishes in countries like Afghanistan against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.    This action packed story shows how a dedicated and courageous man can risk his life for his country and beliefs, but because he is moral, and worried about liberal Democratic political and legal action against him at home, he makes a decision to spare the life of two \\"civilians\\" who give up his position to the Taliban.    That mistake and the Afghan civilians' betrayal brings the wrath of hell down upon him and his several Navy Seal teammates in combat in the form of over a hundred of the hateful enemey.    A near miraculous battle ensues, the nature of which any war movie would be proud to include, and Marus narrowly escapes as the last Seal standing to tell this amazing tale of American heros.    My heart goes out to Marcus, a true American hero, and I wish him the best of luck in all he will accomplish in the future.    Scott Richard Campbell  Author of Rush
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I am so not a beatles fan but I found this movie to be absolutley amazing. If you like musicals you will love this!
B0013D8LOU|2.0|It seems everyone is coming to this film with some preconceived notions about what it should or should not be. Some are too attached to the stage production and others are too eager to consider what was done on stage as irrelevant. Some consider Sondheim a god and others don't. I think I'm somewhere in the middle of all that. I love much of Sondheim's work, but I don't think he is the greatest theater composer and I don't think \\"Sweeney Todd\\" is the greatest of all musicals. I've never seen this performed live, but I am very familiar with the video of the stage production starring Lansbury and Hearn as well as the Broadway Cast Recording.    The film is remarkably faithful to the stage production, but given Tim Burton's take on the material and the casting, I think the movie would actually have been more successful if it had been less faithful to the stage play. By adhering so closely to the source material, without retaining certain key elements that made that material work, Burton has made a movie that I found very frustrating and unsatisfying.    The movie looks great. The photography and production design are stunning.    The young lovers, a necessary plot device, but quite annoying in the stage production, are well cast, have had their roles judiciously parred down and are quite tolerable here. However, I still feel that the song \\"Johanna\\", despite having one of Sondheim's most beautiful melodies, also has some of the dopiest lyrics he has ever written.    The Beggar Woman is also a little annoying in the play, but in the movie her role has not only been severely parred down but cleaned up and consequently the impact of her ultimate fate is badly dulled, robbing the ending of much of it's drama. Some people in the audience seemed confused about who she was.    My impression from the play has always been that Toby is supposed to be a young man or teenager who is somewhat mentally disadvantaged. The movie has turned him into a little boy who seems to be sharp asa tack mentally, although much of the dialogue still refers to him as being dim witted. Sure, having a little boy makes the ending a little more shocking, but I'm not sure it makes sense dramatically.    Now the big problem. Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett. How misconceived are these characterizations? I might have bought Johnny Depp's take on Sweeney had it not been paired with Bonham-Carter's Lovett, but the two together just don't cut it (no pun intended). They are both so enervated right from the beginning that it's hard to believe they could ever conceive of or carry out a plan like this. Mrs. Lovett's character is the real problem here. Certainly it could not have been played in a movie as broadly as Angela Lansbury played it on stage, however, an adaptation of that characterization would have worked. Mrs. Lovett should be anything but enervated. She is the planner. She's a practical woman and a survivor and is constantly working, conniving, planning, plotting. Sweeney may have dreams of vengeance, but it's Mrs. Lovett who makes it work, she's the muscle in this enterprise. Sweeney may be obsessed with death, but Mrs. Lovett is very much alive. Helena Bonham-Carter seems half dead before the movie starts. At one time Meryl Streep was mentioned as a possible Mrs. Lovett and we can only dream about what that performance would have been like.    I also reject the notion that one has to choose between singers and actors. There are many people who are perfectly capable of doing both, although they may not have the star power of Johnny Depp or the personal relationships of Helena Bonham-Carter. The inability of the principals to actually sing this music means that they are totally unable to invest the songs with any kind of nuance or variety or character. After a while I found the monotone in which the music was performed to be tiresome - making all the music performed by these two sound alike.    And what happened to the humor? At first I thought Tim Burton had made a choice to suck virtually all the humor out of the play, but the more I think about it I've come to the conclusion that he probably didn't get it in the first place. I never dreamed I'd encounter a performance of \\"A Little Priest\\" that would garner not one single laugh. This was the fault of both the lackluster vocals and the pedestrian staging. Did Burton really think we needed to actually see a priest, a fop, a green grocer, a runny pie to get the jokes? Also, how are we supposed to enjoy the jokes when the characters making them don't even seem to get them or be amused by them?
0064430227|5.0|This book can be a favorite for Pre-K children on up!  Harold goes on an adventure, creating each scene of the adventure with just one purple crayon. The single color and simple illustrations are similar to those of a young child at that age so it is easy for a child to relate to them.  Pre-K children who have this book read to them can't wait to see what \\"trouble\\" Harold will get into next or how he will get out of a predicament he has unwittingly created with his purple crayon.  For a young child the adventure of Harold is enough of a story.<br /><br />This book, in my opinion, provides a timeless message for all.  It reminds us that our imagination can work in strange ways.  We can create problems and also solve seemingly insurmountable problems with our imagination.<br /><br />Just like Harold we can create our lives.

Ian McEwan's descriptive language is gorgeous, and he is a master at realistically presenting situations from both the male and female characters' perspectives. It's been some time since I finished a book and was in love with it's ending, but I was completely satisfied when I ended this book. It's been months since I finished reading this but I still find myself thinking of it over and over again.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|This is has got to be one of my favorite, if not my favorite album of all times. See, I'm probably the weirdest rock fan on the face of this earth: Black Sabbath is probably the band that has had the biggest impact on me (being a rock musician) and Zeppelin were probably the creators of the genre (Hard Rock) but... Deep Purple is the band that really sums it all up for me: the heaviness from Sabbath, but also the dynamics and subtleties from Zep...and then some! I can't really put it to words, other than saying that EVERY time I hear a Purple song, no matter where I am, who I'm with or what I'm doing, I automatically stop and switch into \\"salivating mode\\" (&agrave; la Homer Simpson when he thinks of donuts...sorry, I digress...). Let's get to it, then...<br /><br />Burn is Purple's eighth studio album, the first with the Mk III lineup of the band, recorded in late 1973 and released in February 1974. Indeed, after almost 4 years of steadily increasing success epitomized by back to back chart topping albums Machine Head (containing the mother of all guitar riff-driven classic songs, \\"Smoke on the Water\\") and the live \\"Made in Japan\\", Deep Purple seemed to be on top of the world. Little did the world at large suspect that singer Ian Gillan's relationship with founding member, guitarist and resident tyrant Ritchie Blackmore (I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I LOVE his music, but the guy has issues...) had evaporated. Gillan resigned to the band in late 1972 (half a year in advance) but agreed to fulfill the band's live commitments.<br /><br />By the time the tour ended, Ritchie had entertained the idea of leaving the band as well and form a new project with drummer and founding member Ian Paice, even going as far as to work with Thin Lizzy main man Phil Lynnot. Purple's management envisioned to keep the band going with bassist Roger Glover and keyboardist and last remaining founding member Jon Lord. Indeed, the band had already survived a major overhaul in 1969 after replacing original members Rod Evans on vocals and Nick Simper on bass. But in a dramatic turn of events, Blackmore decided to stay in Deep Purple as long as Glover left (!). The search for new members was on well before the end of Purple's tour, and it had yielded a prospective candidate: bassist/singer Glenn Hughes from Trapeze. After initially declining the offer, Hughes had a change of heart and relented.<br /><br />Blackmore wished to take the band in a wholly different direction, and he saw this shuffle as the opportunity to materialize his vision: instead of a single vocalist, the band would have a \\"main\\" frontman who would share vocal duties with Hughes to create a new, unique sound. The new frontman they had in mind was Paul Rodgers of Free fame, but as it turned out, Deep Purple tickled him in a wrong way by speaking about his possible involvement to the press, and he ended up turning them down to concentrate on another project, which would eventually evolve into Bad Company.<br /><br />The band required a new voice. And after a grueling, long process that had them consider the possibility of carrying on as a quartet, they found a near unknown named David Coverdale, with little experience but great untapped talent. Purple retreated to work on new material for their next release, and unveiled their new lineup to the press in September 1973, before a single note of music had even been recorded. Shortly after that, they found themselves once more in the Swiss town of Montreux, where Machine Head had seen the light, and with the help of longtime producer/engineer Martin Birch, they got to it.<br /><br />What did they come up with? A masterpiece, a TRUE classic of Hard Rock, no more, no less. Now, popular wisdom says \\"yeah, Burn has great songwriting, but it's not up to par with Machine Head...\\" Rubbish! Did it sell as much? Did it become a staple of (classic) rock radio? Maybe not, but I do not believe that a band's or an album's merits should or evencould be measured by record sales and/or radio airplay. The proof is in the songs. Are they good? Do they move you? Do they rock? The answer is yes, yes, yes. Which takes me to the OTHER prevalent notion that exists about this album: \\"oh, yeah, Burn is fine, but it's a little too bluesy and funky for me...\\" What??? I've never really been able to digest that one: Purple made a name for themselves with slightly psychedelic, guitar driven, organ spiced, fast and furious songs and for the most part, that's exactly what you will find here. There are a few detours, granted, but not enough to justify that \\"it's too bluesy and funky\\" widespread opinion.If you're going to \\"accuse\\" Purple of veering away from their roots and original style and becoming too funky, groovy, bluesy, rn'b influenced, at least save that criticism for the right record (namely Stormbringer, another one of my favorites, change in style notwithstanding... but that's another story...).<br /><br />The album starts with the pedal to the floor with its anthemic, fast paced title song: I can't imagine a better way to introduce the new band. All the trademark elements of Purple are here: the big and nasty guitar riff, the fast tempo, the incredible guitar and organ solos and on top of all, the tandem voices of Hughes and Coverdale, which really shine. The song is reminiscent of earlier hit \\"Highway Star\\", and it's very difficult for me to understand how any fan of Mk II can possibly NOT enjoy this. From the first time I ever heard this song, it grabbed me, and to this day, it just won't let go of me. Next is \\"Might Just Take Your Life\\", a midtempo number with a prominent organ riff that carries the tune for the most part, where the tandem of Coverdale and Hughes again takes the spotlight; it is a bit different, but not that much, really, it can almost remind you a little to songs such as \\"Woman from Tokyo\\".<br /><br />Next is \\"Lay Down, Stay Down\\", another fast paced song where Blackmore has ample space to show his prowess, one of my favorites. The merger of the two distinct voices, Coverdale's deeper tone and Hughes higher harmonies, is simply brilliant, here and elsewhere on the record. This is probably the biggest change and the clearest personality trait from this lineup with regards of all other Purple incarnations, and one of the reasons why I enjoy this album so much: if you ask me, no other lineup of the band rivals the Mk III in sheer musical potential, live or in the studio. They wanted a new, unique sound, and they certainly got it: no other band has EVER sounded like this, before AND after.<br /><br />\\"Sail Away\\" brings the pace down somewhat but again, it features a prominent guitar riff as well as some synth work from Lord that is absolutely great; again, one of my favorite tracks on the album and one where the tandem vocals really bring the song to another level, creating a contrast that is awesome, plain and simple. \\"You Fool No One\\" is another fast rocker that perfectly carries the Purple tradition, and a song that clearly displays Ian Paice's talent with a relentless drum work, as well as Blackmore's love for speed.<br /><br />\\"What's Going On Here\\" is, indeed, somewhat of a departure: a slightly slower pace, a vaguely boogie rhythm, different instrumentation (Lord plays piano instead of organ and/or synth) and it features solos from both Lord and Blackmore that are somewhat more relaxed, with less of a sense of urgency as they had accustomed us, but it's quite a nice change of pace as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Next is \\"Mistreated\\", another monstrous song, another classic. This is probably the other song that really shows the band's new influences and new direction. It is a slow, long blues number where Coverdale and Blackmore take the spotlight while the rest of the band concentrates on creating the right atmosphere for them to take over. It is an awesome track that picks up the pace for a blitzkrieg grand finale. The last song of the album is the instrumental \\"A 200\\" which features Lord's extensive use of synths, great drum and bass work from Paice and Hughes and a somewhat brief yet memorable participation from Blackmore, who comes in midway through the song to play a brain melting solo. Simply put, this album rocks from start to end.<br /><br />Now, this thirtieth anniversary edition (devised by the Deep Purple Appreciation Society and EMI, Purple's label for the world outside the US, and picked up a full year later by Rhino) packs some added treats: the album has been completely remastered and expanded with help from Glenn Hughes to include five additional tracks especially remixed for this release. I'll be honest with you: I already owned Burn on CD, having bought it a couple of years before this re-release (in a especially priced British 2 CD set released by EMI that also included Stormbringer), and I was really looking forward for the remastering since I felt that my CD sounded a little too low for my taste, so I was really hoping that this one would rip my head off...alas, that was NOT the case...the album sounds somewhat clearer, but not that much of an improvement over my old CD, really...and believe me, I've spent enough time listening to this album to know every little nuance of it, so I would have immediately noticed if anything major about it had been changed, including volume levels...so if anyone tries to convince you to buy this album on the grounds of its \\"superior\\" sound, almost selling it as if it were a whole new thing, be warned: IT IS NOT A NEW THING! It's the same album, only slightly clearer.<br /><br />The extra tracks? Oh, yeah, they're cool: \\"Coronarias Redig\\", a somewhat obscure b-side is a nice, funky, groovy,  instrumental where Blackmore once again steals the show with his extended soloing, a nice addition to the package. The remixes are nice too, and I have to say that Glenn's taste essentially matches mine since he chose to remix my four favorite tracks from the album (only \\"Lay Down, Stay Down\\" is missing...) But no major surprises here: if you're expecting to hear disco beats, industrial heaviness, electronica flavors or even alternate takes of solos, you will be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />According to the liner notes (the booklet is chockfull with pictures and information, quite valuable for a collector), there wasn't much in the sense of alternate tracks recorded for the album, so what you're going to find are small, blink-and-you-miss-it kind of changes: \\"Burn\\" features a slightly different sounding keyboard solo and some subtle additional backing tracks during the guitar solo, \\"Mistreated\\" features a slightly different guitar intro and outro (don't blink!), \\"You Fool No One\\" is probably the one that changes \\"the most\\" with an alternate guitar intro (very much like the one Ritchie would play live) and \\"Sail Away\\" features slightly different keyboards and a couple of additional backing vocals, but that's it. \\"Burn\\" and \\"Sail Away\\" feature insignificantly shorter fades, while \\"Mistreated\\" and \\"You Fool No One\\" feature the opposite (insignificantly longer fades...yawn...)<br /><br />Bottom Line: this is a great record, five star-worthy if you ask me. Deep Purple had a lot to live up to, and they did. Is it in the same league as Machine Head? I'll let you folks come up with your own answer, but I honestly don't think that anyone who enjoyed the Mk II output of the band wouldn't enjoy this. Now, if you ALREADY own this album and are just feeling tempted by the remastering and the bonus tracks: BEWARE! You're NOT buying a new album, you're just getting it in a slightly updated, clearer, expanded form that, as far as I'm concerned, lacks punch, and one that has very little \\"new\\" to offer other than \\"Coronarias Redig\\". I guess if you're a completist (such as yours truly) or a Deep Purple freak (again, such as yours truly...), you won't mind all that much, my only observation/complaint being the one I did about the remastering not being as \\"in your face\\" as I had hoped.<br /><br />But if you are one of those people who, for whatever reason, have hesitated to get this album, this is the moment to make up your mind: this is a great hard rock masterpiece (totally underrated if you ask me...) that would make a fine addition to any true rock fan's collection. This is Purple at its most dynamic and free, and if you ask me, at their best. Oh, just one last thing: you might wanna reconsider buying one of those imports editions: they have the EXACT SAME content, so you would be paying up to four times as much just for the additional outer sleeve. Get this one instead and... Play it `til it Burns!!!!and bass work from Paice and Hughes and a somewhat brief yet memorable participation from Blackmore, who comes in midway through the song to play a brain melting solo. Simply put, this album rocks from start to end.    Now, this thirtieth anniversary edition (devised by the Deep Purple Appreciation Society and EMI, Purple's label for the world outside the US, and picked up a full year later by Rhino) packs some added treats: the album has been completely remastered and expanded with help from Glenn Hughes to include five additional tracks especially remixed for this release. I'll be honest with you: I already owned Burn on CD, having bought it a couple of years before this re-release (in a especially priced British 2 CD set released by EMI that also included Stormbringer), and I was really looking forward for the remastering since I felt that my CD sounded a little too low for my taste, so I was really hoping that this one would rip my head off...alas, that was NOT the case...the album sounds somewhat clearer, but not that much of an improvement over my old CD, really...and believe me, I've spent enough time listening to this album to know every little nuance of it, so I would have immediately noticed if anything major about it had been changed, including volume levels...so if anyone tries to convince you to buy this album on the grounds of its \\"superior\\" sound, almost selling it as if it were a whole new thing, be warned: IT IS NOT A NEW THING! It's the same album, only slightly clearer.     The extra tracks? Oh, yeah, they're cool: \\"Coronarias Redig\\", a somewhat obscure b-side is a nice, funky, groovy,  instrumental where Blackmore once again steals the show with his extended soloing, a nice addition to the package. The remixes are nice too, and I have to say that Glenn's taste essentially matches mine since he chose to remix my four favorite tracks from the album (only \\"Lay Down, Stay Down\\" is missing...) But no major surprises here: if you're expecting to heardisco beats, industrial heaviness, electronica flavors or even alternate takes of solos, you will be sorely disappointed.     According to the liner notes (the booklet is chockfull with pictures and information, quite valuable for a collector), there wasn't much in the sense of alternate tracks recorded for the album, so what you're going to find are small, blink-and-you-miss-it kind of changes: \\"Burn\\" features a slightly different sounding keyboard solo and some subtle additional backing tracks during the guitar solo, \\"Mistreated\\" features a slightly different guitar intro and outro (don't blink!), \\"You Fool No One\\" is probably the one that changes \\"the most\\" with an alternate guitar intro (very much like the one Ritchie would play live) and \\"Sail Away\\" features slightly different keyboards and a couple of additional backing vocals, but that's it. \\"Burn\\" and \\"Sail Away\\" feature insignificantly shorter fades, while \\"Mistreated\\" and \\"You Fool No One\\" feature the opposite (insignificantly longer fades...yawn...)    Bottom Line: this is a great record, five star-worthy if you ask me. Deep Purple had a lot to live up to, and they did. Is it in the same league as Machine Head? I'll let you folks come up with your own answer, but I honestly don't think that anyone who enjoyed the Mk II output of the band wouldn't enjoy this. Now, if you ALREADY own this album and are just feeling tempted by the remastering and the bonus tracks: BEWARE! You're NOT buying a new album, you're just getting it in a slightly updated, clearer, expanded form that, as far as I'm concerned, lacks punch, and one that has very little \\"new\\" to offer other than \\"Coronarias Redig\\". I guess if you're a completist (such as yours truly) or a Deep Purple freak (again, such as yours truly...), you won't mind all that much, my only observation/complaint being the one I did about the remastering not being as \\"in your face\\" as I had hoped.      But if you are one of those people who, for whatever reason, have hesitated to get this album, this is the moment to make up your mind: this is a great hard rock masterpiece (totally underrated if you ask me...) that would make a fine addition to any true rock fan's collection. This is Purple at its most dynamic and free, and if you ask me, at their best. Oh, just one last thing: you might wanna reconsider buying one of those imports editions: they have the EXACT SAME content, so you would be paying up to four times as much just for the additional outer sleeve. Get this one instead and... Play it `til it Burns!!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|1. Going Under - The intro to the CD. It's a lot harder than a lot of pop-rock I tend to hear these days and that's good. The opening riff is extremely uncomplicated yet it does it's job quite well. This was their 2nd single. According to Wikipedia this song is about the emotional and physical abuse Lee dealt with in a previous relationship. Much sadder now that I know what the lyrics are totally based on. Must've broken her in two...<br /><br />Also fun to sing and actually dance in the shower to. >_> 5.5/5<br /><br />2. Bring Me To Life - first single, doesn't bring much new to the table but it's truth is what held ground. relate-able lyrics about being half yourself without a love. a true love. same riffs you've come to expect thus far, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. you can hate me for doing so, but i love this song. still. it came out April 22nd, 2003 and even on February 22nd, 2008, it stands as strong as ever. stronger even! 5/5<br /><br />3. Everybody's Fool - I love the message in this song. I knew it had some reference to pop stars by watching the awesome video which gave us insight in 2003/2004. But looking at Wiki, I see that it's a bit deeper; Amy saw her sister glamorizing pop stars such as Christina Aguilera and was pissed. She wrote this song in retaliation for her disgust for what she's now become. Sure, her music may be harder, but a pop star, she is.<br /><br />Now that I've said that, it's contradicting, but humans on a whole are contradicting so it takes nothing away from the song. In fact, she may not have hate for Christina or Britney directly, but that lifestyle; the way they WANT you portrayed when you come out is probably fuming to her. 5.5/5<br /><br />4. My Immortal - Their most famous ballad, hands down, MTV-wise and probably otherwise. To me, it's for very good reason: it's soft, as portrayed through the video and the album version but the only (big) difference is the ending; on the main album version, it stays soft, but in the video and on track 12 here, right before the end, the softness breaks, and the bass guitar is once again brought out. It was the perfect time to do so, and sends you skyrocketing emotionally. A bittersweet tale.<br /><br />I *LOVE* the end of the video when she holds her head between folded arms, like a child, as if all is doomed because of a love gone wrong. Their best video still. Single 4 (from this album) and Single 2 from the sophomore effort are close. 5.25/5 (6/5 for the video, not included on this disc)<br /><br />5. Haunted - A song that starts off with a brief, lite and lovely hip-hop beat. It gets harder though, featuring bass guitar done by Francesco DiCosmo too, who's done all the guitar work thus far, and the brief solo run, mid-song, he does is catchy.<br /><br />The lyrics don't go anywhere new really, until Amy pleads, \\"raping me.\\" and you're like What?! Yes, she really says that! The beginning is my favorite part. 4.5/5.<br /><br />6. Tourniquet - A tale of suicide believe it or not. You must look some of these things up to actually \\"get\\" it. I thought this was just about a lost soul (human), praying to be redeemed, and bettered.<br /><br />That turns out half-true, and the rest is that the person HAS committed suicide, asking, as they lay dying \\"Am I too lost...to be saved? Am...I...too...lost?\\" finally, meeting with death...<br /><br />Didn't like it the first time I heard it in '04 after Christmas (bought it for my buddy Ebony who LOVED it, and was only disappointed that the band version of My Immortal (track 12) was missing on the original) because I was so not into any thought, religious then. I was just sick of it and this song reminded me of that.<br /><br />But now I see that it's deeper than I thought. And for that it gets props. 4.5/5<br /><br />7. Imaginary - \\"In my field of paper flowers, ... \\"I lie in myself for hours\\", etc, etc. A relate-able mid-tempo. If you're numb and can barely feel anymore, then this song is for you. Repetitiveriffs, but what's important is that it's relate-able. 4/5<br /><br />8. Taking Over Me - Not too bad at all. It doesn't step out of the predictable zone, but I do like the lyrics, \\"Who can decide what they dream? And dream I do.\\" Not much more to say. It's got the pretty vocal, it's got the bass guitar but not much new is here. 3.5/5<br /><br />9. Hello - This was the first song that I heard mentioned on a review or two about their second album, that I had not known at all. Everyone was praising it saying that Amy was unable to channel anything as good as this heartbreaking ballad after the debut. So I checked it out Summer '07.<br /><br />I wasn't let down one bit. In fact, I was all the more enchanted. This song has no metal fabrications whatsoever. It just is. It's real and raw. Very heart-wrenching. I'll just say it's about her now dead-for-years sister and the reality that she's left behind; next to nothing for Amy to see or hold onto but pain, loneliness and true emptiness...here, she reminisces and reveals what she's felt since her absence, but on The Open Door ('06), a track Like You which is similar in vein, spouts how Amy wants to be just like her little sister; DEAD.<br /><br />The ending to Hello is truly mesmerizing; the way she holds the note, then goes lower and lower in key is UN-forgettable and won't let go. BEST track by them I've ever heard between both albums, and popular for very good reason. 6/5<br /><br />10. My Last Breath - This song could have been gold. The been-there-done-that sound of the bass really, really sounds good here. No complaints in that regard. But the arrangement doesn't totally do it for me. But after the bridge, the bass kicks back into the chorus and I love it. 4/5<br /><br />11. Whisper - Not bad vocal-wise till her voice goes up and then up at the end, a few times then it's a bit iffy. Not off-key but almost like it wants to. But the problem here is the lyrics. She's pretty much said this all in another song. And the chants in the background towards the end are kinda cool yet kinda weird. Not scary, just kinda weird. (: 4.25<br /><br />12. My Immortal (Band Version/Video Version) - Just Like the first describes it, it's like the first but gets hard at the end, stirring emotions. A touching, slow ballad. 5.5/5<br /><br />Cover Art: B+ -- Very pretty in a pale kinda way.<br />Inside Art: B -- Not much to work with but the little symbols on page 1 and two, and at the end are cool. The one page where the band is is awesome too. Amy just lies there, waiting...<br />Songwriting: C -- Can become repetitive and tiresome, but it's usually relate-able to the down-and-trotted.<br />Vocals: C++ Soaring at best, enchanting when she's restraining.<br />Vocal Emotion: C++ -- Better than the vocals I suppose. Could be wrong.<br />Production: B- -- Predictable metal-ish riffs with the power of the bass guitar are only so varied (meh) yet the occasional hip-hop pop feel comes through your speaker also (good). The calm ballads (Track 4, 9 and 12) are the only ones that have minimal to no noisy production and I prefer those overall.<br />Length: B- (Wish it were at least 13 tracks...)<br /><br />4.659090909091<br /><br />4.66 stars.<br /><br />Overall: A<br /><br />In the end I must say that Amy has talent; her songwriting, though limited to 2-3 subjects is not too bad and the arrangements for some of these tunes are enchanting.<br /><br />HOWEVER, if you know the real back story to some of these songs, it's Moody who should get most of the praise. Sure, Amy brings it to life but without Moody, this album would never be! My Immortal is about his grandfather that passed, and not about just any relationship. The song takes different shape once you know that! However, we all know songs are something different to us all so, meh. :P<br /><br />Leave comments as you feel. This is all my opinion.doesn't step out of the predictable zone, but I do like the lyrics, \\"Who can decide what they dream? And dream I do.\\" Not much more to say.

B00014TJ6Q|4.0|I'll make it short and sweet......   I lost interest in George after \\"Living In The Material World\\" in 1973. Six years later, this was the album that made me re-discover him. There's some georgous melodies on this album.
0895260131|3.0|I bought this hopeing for a bit more humor, something to put the FUN back into fundementalism.  I didnt get much \\"funny\\" from this book, but it did contain alot of good information that people should definately know. However I would not hand this offf to some one that didnt already have a decent concept or background in religious study.  It is not an in depth look into Islam, it is a focus on modern apologetic arguemnts and the tenets of Islam that have allowed the \\"crazy folk\\" to do what they do and think as they think.  The topics range from the argument we hereabout the crusades to politcal developments in the last century to the smoke screen OUR media has used to keep the public from knwoing anything useful about the true nature of the Islamic world and its mission.  I sugges tthis book but I suggest others to read along with it such as History of Jihad, and of course dont take everything \\" as is\\", the author has a point he's making and at times other investigation and deliberation are sacrificed in order to keep that point.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|My comments only concern the DVD versus Blu-ray issue.     I have an older version of the DVD (Stanley Kubrick Collection, white box) and the deluxe Blu-ray version. My experience has been that DVDs mastered in high definition look identical to the Blu-ray version (either on a Blu-Ray player or an upconvert DVD player). In this case, the Blu-ray version is MUCH better.  The differece is much like the samples used in stores to show the difference betwee regular and high definition--you know, grainy on one side sharp on the other.      Also, the DVD version is full frame and the Blu-ray version is widescreen.  What's odd, however, is that to make the widescreen version the top and bottom of the full screen version were chopped off--sort of the opposite of how widescreen movies are trimmed for full screen.  Even so, I carefully watched and it didn't seem to matter.  There were still a few grainy scenes (mostly combat scenes), but these were still much better than the DVD version.    Another big plus is that the Blu-ray version has special features (a commentary track,a behind the scenes featurette, and the trailer), but the DVD only has the trailer.    Unlike some Blu-ray versions, this one was definitely worth the upgrade.
B000002ARV|5.0|One of the most important things about Johnny Winter's rugged brand of the blues is that Johnny isn't afraid to go to places where the blues actually live in real ways. Places where people's lives aren't what they should be. Places where booze and drugs offer temporary relief from hopelessness, where bad relationships wreck dreams, and working too hard for too little pay wears people down and out. Without acknowledging the pain and suffering that gave birth to the blues, the music becomes an \\"art form\\" and a sanitized imitation of the real thing. Johnny Winter is definitely not about sanitized imitations.<br /><br />On Still Alive And Well (1973), not only does Johnny play the blues in an authentically rugged way, but he plays high energy rock n' roll and hippie barstool country the same way. Among the rock songs here are great rousing and rocking versions of Rock Me Baby, Rock & Roll and Can't You Feel It. Blistering guitar licks and screaming vocals abound. Cheap Tequila is a very strong ballad (and a rare treat, as Johnny doesn't do many ballads), and one of my favorites here. Winter does two Rolling Stones covers, Let It Bleed and Silver Train, and they're both just as good (even better in some places) as the originals. Too Much Seconal is down and dirty acoustic blues, with acoustic slide, mandolin, flute and lyrics from life on the wrong side.<br /><br />Oh baby, I don't believe you're no good at all<br />No, you keep drinkin' too much whiskey<br />You're takin' too much seconal<br /><br />Of course, Winter's guitar work on Still Alive And Well is also outstanding, to say the least. Johnny is one of the very best guitarists in a generation of rock's greatest guitarists. Rock n' roller Rick Derringer (Rock & Roll, Hoochie Koo) produced this album, and really brought out the rock n' roll side of Johnny Winter. The album has all of the energy of a rock n' roll production. The bad boy of blues/rock is rugged, raunchy and screaming loud on this one, and if you don't mind a little harsh reality with your blues/rock, then you really can't go wrong with Still Alive And Well. AND TURN IT UP LOUD!!th your blues/rock, then you really can't go wrong with Still Alive And Well. AND TURN IT UP LOUD!!
0783226845|5.0|This is a truly remarkable movie. Al Pacino and Chris O'Donnell are the perfect duo. It will make you laugh, cry, and even have you rooting for the guy that no one really likes anymore. Great purchase!
B000A6T262|4.0|The movie quality is great and the additional material is wonderful. The only downside to this set is the quality of the packaging. The cardboard case is flimsy and provides no real support for the films. It is for show only. The individual movie cases are difficult to deal with. The 2 discs are overlapped in the case and you must remove the movie disc to get to the feature disc. In addition, there is no release mechanism in the case for the DVD's. You just pull them off the plastic retainer. It always feels like the movie is going to break before it comes free. Still, great set for the price.

B00102F5WK|3.0|A distressingly realistic film that unveils the horrors of terrorism and what governments do to get to the roots of evil, Rendition suffers from the fact that reality doesn't always equal entertainment. Incredibly powerful performances and well-developed characters evoke sympathy for two hours, but wholehearted satisfaction mysteriously eludes the film.<br /><br />Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) is captured by the FBI and interrogated for suspected terrorist activities. When the initial investigation leads nowhere, he is shipped out of the US in a process called \\"extraordinary rendition\\" to be further questioned by considerably more brutal methods. Meanwhile, his wife Isabella (Reese Witherspoon) pleads with longtime friend Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard) to help locate her missing husband. In South Africa, where Anwar is being held, investigations of a bombing that killed a US agent leads Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal) to observe the inhuman treatment of terrorist prisoners, and to battle with the idea of sacrificing an innocent life in the remote chance that it will save others.<br /><br />Rendition examines the lengths people will go to seek justice. It also examines what forms of justice people seek, and the oftentimes detrimental effect it has on innocent bystanders. Douglas must weigh his own conscience against the horrific torturing of Anwar, who only possesses the possibility of information, and disobeying his superiors. Alan weighs his conscience against doing what he believes to be right, and the importance of his career. Almost everyone else in the film faces mental turmoil, including Alan Arkin as Senator Hawkins, who has much less sympathy for Isabella, and Meryl Streep as Corrine Whitman who chooses to ignore the suffering of others due to her paranoid decision-making.<br /><br />Rendition suffers from too many stories and a bizarre time shift that unexpectedly confuses the audience. Similar to 2006's Babel, Rendition includes too many characters and too many subplots. Douglas's storyline, involving an unnecessary love interest, is connected to Abasi Fawal, who oversees the violent torture of terrorist suspects. Isabella deals with the disappearance of her husband and tracking down those responsible, and Abasi's daughter Fatima runs away from home to protest her arranged marriage, falling into the arms of a Jihad terrorist who likewise has mixed feelings about his purpose and beliefs.<br /><br />The film's biggest highlight is the superb acting from nearly all of its major players. Witherspoon is exceptional as the devoted and tear-inducing mother who has the added sympathy factor of a troubled young child and a pregnancy. Gyllenhaal is interesting to watch, although a little static with his performance and Metwally does a great job of being tortured for two hours. Streep, Arkin and Sarsgaard actually turn in even more memorable performances due to their strong personalities and commanding presence. With a confusingly ill-placed time jump near the conclusion, and a disturbing story fused with phenomenal acting, Rendition hints at Academy Award worthy performances as well as that the CIA can learn a thing or two from Google.<br /><br />- Mike Massielas's storyline, involving an unnecessary love interest, is connected to Abasi Fawal, who oversees the violent torture of terrorist suspects.

0743289684|4.0|I have been studying Islam and the Middle East (the good, the bad, and the ugly) for several years now.  Infidel is one of the first books I have read that comes not from an OUTSIDE observer critquing the Rise of Militant Islam, but from one who actually lived, worshipped, experienced and was victimized first hand by it's corosive nature.     While Western scholars, experts and university professors debate, speculate and write books about the events in the Middle East this author actually lived thru them.  Ayaan writes about actual facts, not opinions.  What a tremedous eye opener \\"Infidel\\" is.  I highly recomend it to anyone looking for a first hand MIDDLE EASTERN point of view of religion run amoke.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali can not be silenced by Islamic terrorist or by the Politically Correct police.  If you want the real deal here it is.

B000002GYR|5.0|Rest assured, if ytour only familiar with later Tom Waits, it may just shock you to hear this album.  Don't worry about that though, he didn;'s start out as a no talent artist making lame soft rock songs with all the musical merit of crappy pop singers like Patti Page (the one responsible for How Much is that Doggy in The Window). Tom Waits wass a bloomer from the beggining.  He wrote some of the most tearful love songs on this album.  I'm usually one that doesn't cry when listening to music, but listening to this album almost did make me shed a tear.Of course he still offers some great songwriting that other artists still cannot match (for the most part).  He still has some distinct voice that he still has from the beggining, although it's not as gritty (not even close, actually of his later voice).  He still sounds like one person, and that's Tom Waits.<br /><br />You won't find any songs about death, so I'll clear it up.  He still, however, does put his spin on the love song, as you won't find any much resembling the love song that most people think of when that particular word comes to mind.  The sound on this album can be quite jazzy, or sometimes bluesy, even a bit country but it's always quite beautiful.  It's character only makes the lyrics further understandable.  Songs like Ol'55 and has the sunny morning on the highway feel, and Ice Cream Man is a bit jazzy, it perfectly matches the quite swanky lyrics.  It's not the same song that Van Halen covered on their debut, however.<br /><br />Lyrically, Waits doesn't slouch.  He knows how to direct what he's talking about.  I hope I don't Fall In Love You tells a story of that good old unrequited love we get into, and how it can painful, of course (judging from the line \\"cause falling in love just makes be blue\\").  Matha may be one of the best on here.  Tom Waits does a great perfomrance, and Bette Midler's version further shows how poerful this guy can be.  It's a story about and old man who call an old lover.  It turns into quite a tearjerker.  I also love Little Trip to Heaven (On the  Wings of Your Love).  It may be the song I play for all future girlfriends.  The lyrics themselves could easily be poems on there own.  The music only brings all the emotions to life.  When music has the power to do things like this, it's a wonder why so many people give a ____ about books.<br /><br />Sure, I found minor problems in songs like Lonely and Grapefruit Moon (both not up to snuff with the rest of the songs), but everything else is great stuff.  It may be a shock to people who were weaned with later material like Bone Machine and Rain Dogs, but don't let the music turn you off completely.  All of us have trouble adjusting sometimes.  Trust me, it's worth it.ite a tearjerker.  I also love Little Trip to Heaven (On the  Wings of Your Love).  It may be the song I play for all future girlfriends.

B0011HOEY4|4.0|Though it languished in development-hell for some time, American Gangster has finally seen the light of day, with none other than visionary director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Alien, Blade Runner) at the helm.  Oscar winning mega-stars Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are the prime drawing point of the film, and both actors chew every bit of scenery that they can during the film's duration.  Washington is Frank Lucas, the newly christened drug kingpin of Harlem after taking the reigns from legendary gangster Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III), and soon finds himself hounded by crooked cops, rival dealers, and honest cop Richie Roberts (Crowe).  Though it really doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before in the gangster epic genre, American Gangster is still a rousing and worthwhile crime epic that is carried by the power of its stars and director.  The action and set pieces are well done, but the film as a whole doesn't come close to the greatness that it aspires to emulate from other classics in the genre like Serpico and The Untouchables.  Flaws aside though, American Gangster is still a more than admirable true crime drama, which can be evidenced even more so on the unrated extended cut, which is included here along with the theatrical release.  The extended cut features much more character development, which isn't a bad thing at all when the cast includes Chiwetel Eliofor, Josh Brolin, Cuba Gooding Jr, Ted Levine, Armand Assante, Deadwood's John Hawkes, rappers RZA and Common, and Ruby Dee in a brief Oscar nominated turn as Lucas' mother.  All in all, American Gangster is a very satisfying crime drama, and though it really isn't anything we haven't seen before, it's still definitely worth a look.
0393330435|5.0|iWoz is an interesting book about the man who almost single-handedly started a revolution.  I loved reading about how Woz designed the Apple I and Apple II computers.  He's a guy that's on a whole different level than most engineers.  I'd love to meet him someday.  If you are interested in how personal computers came to be, I highly recommend you read this book along with \\"Fire in the Valley\\" and \\"Hackers\\".  Also, buy the DVD \\"Pirates of Silicon Valley\\".  Thanks Woz for bringing computers to the masses!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|... and two very, very good ones.  Like most others, I think that \\"Falling Slowly\\" is/should be a classic... period (the Oscar voters seem to agree).  But \\"If You Want Me\\" (mostly sung by Irglova) and \\"When Your Mind is Made Up\\" are also very, very good songs.  These are the first three tracks but after that, unfortunately, the album falls off a bit... but would it even be possible for any artists to keep up the pace set by \\"Falling Slowly\\" for 13 tracks?  That is not to say that the rest is bad, just that it is, say, \\"pretty good\\" and not up to the super-high standard set by the first three tracks.    So, how can I give a 13-track CD 5-stars based on only three of the tracks being very good (or better)?  Because those three tracks are that freakin' good, that's why!      If you don't much care about audio quality, I would say go for the Amazon downloads of the first three tracks and save your $$$ on the rest.  And yet I think that this is one of the albums that benefits from the best possible playback; so much of it rests on the emotion of the players getting across and lossy MP3s are not likely to get that all-the-way across.  It is albums like this that make me wish I had a killer analog rig... I wonder if this album is available on SACD...?
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|One of the Greatest Vocalist Ever and a timeless Instrument is the words thatg i would use to describe Whitney Houston. Her voice is so Soulful and she is a versatile artist. these songs capture a time period and she leaves a lasting mark with her range and tone.  a must have for Whitney Houston fans.
B000NTHT6G|5.0|This all star comedic cast delivers in this clean cut immensely charming flick. Will Ferrell is brilliantly dull as he takes on a semi-serious role as Harold Crick; a man who's fate it is to die. Unbeknownced to Harold, a dreadfully dark author Karen Eiffel, played by Emma Thompson, is trying to kill Harold Crick...in her book. Karen is a well known author who is infamous for killing off the main character in every book she writes. Harold is the next victim. But what Karen doesn't know is that Harold Crick is real.     An intelligent and charming story about delusions, irony, discovery, love, and most importantly a wrist watch, that will warm your heart and stay with you forever. This is a must see for those who wish to detach themselves from the main stream titles who follow the \\"typical movie formula.\\" It will always remain as one of my favorite movies of all time.
B00005JA2B|5.0|Along with Masque, I believe Leftoverture to be Kansas' finest work.  This compilation offers a wide variety of soundscapes and textures.  If you like lush keyboards, wonderful vocal harmonies, busy-yet-tight bass lines, drumming that is technical, yet not-overdone, finely-played violin, and the vocal talents of not one but three, you cannot go wrong by purchasing Leftoverture.  Those of you in your forties and fifties probably already know this.  Those of you who are quite a bit younger, trust me, please.
B0011HOEY4|3.0|'American Gangster' is the story of Frank Lucas (Washington), the Harlem druglord who began as a driver and bodyguard for the notorious Bumpy Johnson, and ended up controlling a multi-million dollar heroin empire in his peak. Most of the film takes place during the Vietnam War, and without giving too much away, this circumstance plays a major role in Lucas' success. In fact, some may be shocked by the nefarious actions revealed by this aspect of the film. And of course, what's a good gangster flick without the righteous yet down on his luck cop, played here by Crowe, serving as the determined antagonist to Lucas' dreams of grandeur? There are also plenty of crooked cops to go around, and this plays an important role in the story as well.<br /><br />It is a very well-crafted film, and Washington and Crowe put on remarkable performances as usual, but unfortunately the film doesn't really offer anything new. At bottom, it is just another glamorized rendition of a ruthless criminal figure (who maintains a veneer of respectability) who has claimed his piece of the American pie through crime and brutality. Take Goodfellas, throw it into a pot with New Jack City, add a dash of Serpico, and voila; you have American Gangster. Also, the film is apparently only semi-true, as many liberties have been taken with the story. All in all, a well made film that gangster/cop film buffs will enjoy, but those looking for something deeper will probably not find much here to write home about. 3.5 stars.

Best movie I have seen in a long long time.  Was not a big fan of Johnny Depp before, but this was his best.  Artistically genius- hats off to Tim Burton.  Helena does not get enough credit...she is the only person I could think of that fits this piece like a glove.  She is fabulous.
B00008QSAA|5.0|While being the second album in the Mountain \\"catalog\\" it was the first Album to feature the classic Mountain line-up of Leslie West, Felix Pappalardi, Corky Lang, and Steve Knight. Mountain \\"Climbing!\\" is a unique and dynamic masterpiece of classic rock.  This was band that truly had two front men; one of the most potent collaboratives in the business, Leslie West and the late Felix Pappalardi.Mississippi Queen and Never In My Life are two hard rock definitives by which all others can be judged.  \\"The Laird\\" is an ethereal whisper, with some of the sweetest lead guitar sounds you will ever hear. \\"Silver Paper,\\" and \\"Boys In The Band\\" both deliver the trademark \\"one-two punch\\" to great effect.  But, it's cuts like \\"For Yasgur's Farm,\\" and \\"Theme for an Imaginary Western,\\" both of which define the dynamic rock ballad, that the pure magic of the combination of these two powerful musical forces is especially evident. Without a doubt it is to be counted among one of the very best classic rock albums ever recorded. Oh, and BTW, the production on this album is especially outstanding.

B00005JPNY|5.0|Learning that \\"The Golden Compass\\" won the Oscar for Best Special Effects in 2008 should push the makers to produce its' sequels. As a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy story-telling, this was one book-to-movie adaptation I had waited for, and this was one rare instance where I found the film excelling the book in certain aspects.<br /><br />One of the prime reasons I liked the book was because of its new take on Christianity and the Catholic Church in general. It didn't really say anything new, but the fact that a 'childrens' book could even address such topics was of course controversial to a certain degree. That said, the film does away with explicit reference to the Church, though everyone acts and behaves in a manner suited to the old guard of the Catholic Church. Believe me, the religious subtext in this movie is quite subtle - but if you pick up on certain lines and bits of dialogue, they did manage to slide a lot in here that I'm glad censors didn't pick up on it. For this alone, it breaks new ground.<br /><br />Second, I am probably the only person around who doesn't think too highly of both the 'Harry Potter' and 'The Lord of the Rings' movie franchises. I never particularly cared for LOTR as a book, and the film versions seemed overwrought and way too pretentious for their own good. But thats just me. \\"The Golden Compass\\" is far superior to both those book series, in my opinion, and in a movie it soars past both of them. THIS is what a fantasy film should look like - challenging situations, amazing use of CGI (most of which was created by an obscure design firm in Mumbai, India of all places) and a spectacular acting job by the young leads.<br /><br />The concept of a 'daemon' (pronounced 'demon') was always interesting to me from the start - but the wondrous use of imagery elevates this concept to a whole new level here - it really is something you've never seen on the screen before. Nicole Kidman's daemon is a golden monkey - one of the more luminous creatures in this film - and she is caught in a battle of love and hate with it.<br /><br />The young actress who plays the lead should be especially commended. In her scenes as conniving wench who acts as instigator between the two great polar bears, she is superb. Eva Green plays a witch who believes in eternal love, and this beautiful French actress should have been given more screen time. However, its in its' scenes with Nicole Kidman that give this movie an edge of fear and suspense - she plays it straight, with no emotion in her eyes except calculation and scheming - and her scenes crackle with intensity.<br /><br />\\"The Golden Compass\\" is a big-screen movie, but no doubt it rightfully will find a place in your DVD library. It definitely deserves to. As an adult, the film spoke to me of so many mature, adult themes, leading me to believe that Pullman wrote these books with the world at large as his audience, not just children. In fact, the thought that your daemon can change its' shape repeatedly when you're young, but settles down into one form as you grow older - is a direct confirmation of social conditioning and personal self-worth and identification. The film challenges religious beliefs, but doesn't condemn religion. If you're worried about anti-Christian sentiments here, don't worry. Your children won't pick up on any of it - but they might come back to you with lots of questions. In my book, a great thing.<br /><br />Films like this are one in a million. Granted not all 'special effects' films have a heart, but this one has a heart, mind and soul that is SO very different from other films of the genre. It truly is a very different, special movie, that not many people will 'get'. If you think of yourself as reasonably intelligent, and a little 'different' from people around you - well, then this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Five Solid Stars.lm - and she is caught in a battle of love and hate with it.

Very similar here going through a stargate although in 2001 feeling comfortable is achieved in a hotel room, from that point however the stories change.<br /><br />I did know that Bowman became something more from watching the sequel 2010 but not from 2001.

The illustrations by Clement Hurd are exceptional. Every child should have this book and every parent should read it to them at bedtime.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|So the camera is swinging and lofting and lurching about like a rabid bat on a blood bender, whirling and gyring and wheeling and ducking and lurching about the facial topography of a bazillion pimply, bleary eyed denizens of a New York cocktail party.<br /><br />I'm getting dizzy. I'm getting a little sick. I'm really relating to the character Marlena (tasty Lizzy Kaplan, who suffers a fate that shouldn't happen to a sick dog) in the movie, who does an on-screen puke. Blarf. I'm thinking I've made a terrible mistake. I'm thinking there's 90 minutes of my life I'm not going to ever get back.<br /><br />I'm wrong.<br /><br />Because about 11 minutes into this thing, right about the point where the lead (Michael Stahl-David, as Rob Hawkins) is mooning about the loss of his newly beloved Beth & commiserating with brother Jason and buddy Hud (T.J. Miller soldiering on as the cameraman, by sheer chance and naivete), there's this batrachian howl of rage, or fury, or hunger, constipation (or all of the above) out over the water near Liberty Island, and the whole flick goes wild.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" is a work of insurgent genius: it's about a lonely primal howl of a very different sort---the howl of impending Extinction. And lemme tell ya, baby, it's never easy to be the scouting party headed down Dinosaur Trail.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" is what happens when man---with his 24/7 Internet and email, his up to the second cellphone coverage (except when Giant Monsters Attack!), his field artillery barrage of News on the Move, his pointless cares and useless concerns---gets rudely shouldered over in the Great Galactic Food Chain.<br /><br />It's a movie of totally immersive apocalyptic art, the horror film as nerve jangling stimulant, a kind of hyperkinetic cinematic terrorism. It is brutal. It is scary. It is vicious.<br /><br />And it pulled off something I considered impossible---it disturbed me. Boiled down to its guts, it's a different kind of Ground Zero, and it certainly taps edgily into the horror of 9/11: when the New York Life Building collapes, there's this great moment when a street sweeping wall of smoke and debris comes plowing down the alley and a gaggle of fugitives hunkers down behind the counters and aisles of a darkened pharmacy they've commandeered as a lifeboat against the Terror, and it sorta sets the tone.<br /><br />It's a story of the Day the Earth didn't just stand still, but screamed and ran like a rabbit, and of the Monster who really took Manhattan and used it as an All-you-Can-Eat buffet table.<br /><br />The remarkable thing JJ Abrams and his director Mike Reeves have done is a brilliant little trick of cinematic wizardry, by which he transforms the handheld shaky-came from annoying barrier to excruciatingly intimate portal into a once sane, recognizable world battered into Nightmare Territory.<br /><br />There are some true shockers here, some things that shook me up: the glimpses of a smoke and destruction shrouded Thing working its destruction high up among the lofty spires in the clouds; the frantic shots of a writhing hateful brood which drip off its carapace like snaggle-footed lice and perambulate wildly on the ground like carnivorous Mexcian jumping beans; a girl popping like a blood blister behind the immodest blue screen of a biohazard tent; the terrible spectacle of a highrise buckled in on its neighbor or a battle-tank squashed like an aphid.<br /><br />Some killjoys have posted unexpurgated screenshots of the Creature (or at least Critter #1) in all its warts-and-all CGI glory, waving dismissively that the thing is not the least bit scary.<br /><br />Don't listen to them---besides, what does a still shot prove about menace? Take a gander at a photograph of John Wayne Gacey: he hardly looks like the human shark he was in 3-D life. Set him in motion, unchain his black heart and unshackle his free range menace, and the proposition is entirely different.<br /><br />So it is with the menace and creeping doom of \\"Cloverfield\\", possibly the most engaging horror flick I've seen since \\"Aliens\\": it's less about a Giant Monster (though happily boasting not one, but several, and in a few varieties) and far more about the kind of total Madness that tears off the mask of Civilization and lets us see the bony grinning face of Apocalypse.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" is a wicked little mainline of pure malice and surprisingly nasty cold grue, the paranoid, deeply deranged 21st century's backhanded french kiss to Godzilla and Global Terror.<br /><br />JSGens\\": it's less about a Giant Monster (though happily boasting not one, but several, and in a few varieties) and far more about the kind of total Madness that tears off the mask of Civilization and lets us see the bony grinning face of Apocalypse.     \\"Cloverfield\\" is a wicked little mainline of pure malice and surprisingly nasty cold grue, the paranoid, deeply deranged 21st century's backhanded french kiss to Godzilla and Global Terror.

0807262013|5.0|I am a Christian, but enjoyed listening to Philip Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy.  I am sorry that Lyra and Will cannot be together, but they each have a duty to advise their seperate worlds about telling people who will die someday, not to tell lies but the truth and how they lived their life. Since I have the trilogy on audio will listen to the stories again and again.  Great job Philip Pullman!

If you like this, check out the Kronos Quartet doing the Gorecki string quartet.
0321544080|1.0|Definitely a fiasco of a book. The premise is interesting and the writing is even funny at times, specially all the spelling mistakes. However, 90% of the photography is nothing special. Actually, if those pictures came out of my camera, I would certainly have deleted most of them. This is not what I expected from an award-winning photographer.    The advice in the book is very repetitive (I swear, he explains at least 5 times what a honeycomb filter looks like) and often he simply just keeps stating the obvious. When it is not obvious, it is just beyond the reach of most photographers in terms of setup. Some picture were taking with a dozen strobes with assistants holding reflects, sandbags and a different colored gel on each light!
B00005JPSM|1.0|This film is a complete rip of the German film, Mostly Martha, line by line, scene by scene. Very little original here.    Mostly Martha is a fantastic film and frankly, I had reservations (pun intended) about seeing this film because I didn't want to ruin the wonderful taste in my brain of the original.    Why remake what is already a great movie? Just to get it in English? That's a sad commentary on American audiences.    While most of the actors in this movie are fine in other films, they do a terrible job compared with their European counterparts; Catherine Zeta-Jones just is no Martina Gedeck who put in a spectacular performance as Martha.    I urge anyone reading these reviews and considering this movie to check out Mostly Martha, it's a gem of a movie and a much finer portrayal of what is a great screenplay.
B000VI70WM|5.0|I hadn't listened to Duran Duran seriously in a long time.  I heard all the fuss a couple of years ago about the Fab Five rejoining, and I even gave Astronaut a spin.  I liked it, but I didn't put it into heavy rotation, and sort of forgot about it (don't worry, I've since remedied that mistake).  But when I heard that JT and Timbaland were working with Duran Duran, I thought that it seemed like a very unlikely but really interesting idea.  I had recently started listening to Big Thing again, and was really getting into DD, so when reviews from a lot of trade mags were good, including Rolling Stone, I purchased Red Carpet Massacre sound unheard.      What a great purchase.  This feels like \\"Waiting for the Nightboat\\" might if it were done by Timbaland.  That marvelous Nick Rhodes (genius!) sound is intact, but the beats, the dubs, the samples, the energy all get pushed and shoved through a prism. It doesn't change Duran Duran's basic band sound, but somehow amps the whole thing up.  Simon hasn't sounded this great since Rio, and the entire band seems on fire.     I realize that I've just used two songs (Rio and Nightboat) from their classic period, and I don't want to give anyone the impression that they have returned unabashedly to their former New Romantic sound.  By no means (although that would have been an interesting choice as well).  They sound a lot like Duran Duran does Blackout.  Or is done by Blackout.  The sensuality, the urgency of the early records is here however, and that is why I use the comparison.    Ultimately, this is an electric album with propulsive rhythms, a genuinely energized band, and some real heat.  I don't think that any future Duran Duran albums are going to sound much like this, because I don't think that this is where Duran Duran are ultimately going to go--but I think that it was a brilliant idea to help get them onto a new creative path.      Now if Daniel Lanois wanted to produce them....well, but that would only be a fantasy.  Wouldn't it?  Guys?
B0012K1ILW|3.0|I'll say this much for E. Badu, she is not one to rest on laurels. Nu Amerykah is a truly experimental if not daring project that requires you listen to it several times over. I instantly fell in love with Baduizm and Mama's Gun (one of my favorite CD's ever), I also continue to have a deep appreciation for World Wide Underground. With all that, I was expecting the same response to her latest effort. I was drawn to parts instantly, such as Me, That Hump, Telephone, and of course Honey. The rest of the albums tracks are slowly growing on me. The concept of Amerykah is truly intriguing, and I believe that the album needs to be taken as whole to truly \\"get it\\". I am giving myself several more listens, before I make up my mind. All in All, I am just happy to have a new effort by one of my favorite artists again.

B00005MP58|5.0|I absolutely ADORE the Kiera Knightley version of P&P and watch it often even if it's in the background as I work or puddle about the house.  But having read the book, how can anyone argue this A&E version starring Jennifer Ehrle as not being a truer depiction of Elizabeth Bennet?  To have one reviewer go as far as to comment on Jennifer's weight was appalling to say the least. The weight of women in that time were not a waifish size 1 as in the Keira Knightley portrayal.      I wholeheartedly agree in OPINION that this Jane is not attractive but I also acknowledge that would be my opinion for THIS day and age.  Soft, non-descript features were considered very attractive in past times i.e. Mona Lisa.  Look at your historical figures for both genders in that time and those who had non-descript features were considered the beauties in their day.      Jennifer's portrayal is that of the mature, sensible, sharp Lizzy that Jane Austen wrote of and who both Lizzy's father and Mr. Darcy loved.  With that said, she did an exceptional job.    I love this version, but because of it's length I do not watch as often as the newer P&P version.  They both are very great cinematic pieces and would be an asset to anyone's Jane Austen collection.

If you're expecting the good old Badu sound that we are accustomed to, you're in for a disappointment.  \\"Honey\\" is the only track that sounds like old school Badu.  The rest of the album is just plain weird.  The beats are TIGHT, (don't get me wrong) but the lyrics are repetitive and somewhat annoying.  She also changes beats mid-song, which can be cool sometimes but doesn't do anything for me here.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|We have owned the swivel sweeper for 8 months. It worked pretty well for a  while.   Now, the battery will not hold a charge very long and it only works for about 7 minutes.  Realizing that we need a new batrery, I checked into it. It is 14.95 and 7.00 for shipping.  7.00 for shipping a small battery? This company is really charging 18.00 for the battery because they could ship it for less.  They are just adding shipping as a way to generate more income for them. It does not cost 7.00 to ship a battery that weighs less than a pound.  They think the public is stupid. Typical of TV stuff and we shouldnt have expected more.  I will buy a different brand rather than give this company anymore of my money.     Why would I pay 21.00 for a new battery when I can buy a new swivel sweeper for 10 bucks more.  But hello....I am not buying a new one.  This product could prove expensive to operate over a period of time.

B000WS4QJG|4.0|Really love this album. Remember buying it when it came out and listening to it over and over. Great to revisit but the remixes are really sort of lame. I thought they would be great re-imaginings of the songs and mostly they are just \\"disco versions.\\" Great DVD too. I wonder if the 2001 version with the unreleased songs is still available. Anyone?
B000063DIR|1.0|I saw Ozzy on both his Blizzard of Oz tour and his Diary of a Madman tour.  I bought both albums when they were brand new.  The biggest mistake Ozzy made in his solo career was getting ride of Bob Daisly and Lee Kerslake.  That was until Sharon and he made these awful remasters.  Go to a record store and buy used copies of the originals.  It is amazing what greed can do to rich people.  Ozzy should be ashamed of this.  It was bad enough when he (and Sharon) put pictures of his new band on the original album sleve but to not even put the real music on the cd reisue is a bad joke.  This is a 5 star ripoff of a great album.  And I mean 5 star in a very bad way.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|I bought this as a collection since it came with 3 DVDs for only ~$20. Thanks to Amazon for selling this wonderful trilogy!
B000VBJEFK|5.0|Ordered this movie having only heard that it was pretty good.  Well, it is most excellent. I use my PS3 for playing Blu-ray discs and it does an incredible job.  The detailed artwork of this video is all the eye can a person can take in.  Colors, fineness of detail are just unreal( right down to every lovable rat's individual hairs). Story line is just great too, especially if you like to cook or resaurant work is a part of your life. Fun for the whole family.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Erykah Badu's new single \\"Honey\\" is a catchy upbeat retro funk ditty which still manages to sound contemporary. It's so joyful, no wonder it was picked as the lead-off single for her third studio album proper (though I felt her brilliant \\"Worldwide underground\\" was more than just an EP). However, those looking for more of the same on \\"New Amerykah part 1: World war 4\\" (the first of a planned trilogy) will be sorely disappointed as nothing else on the CD sounds like it. Maybe that is why \\"Honey\\" gets tucked as a hidden track at the end of the CD.<br /><br />Erykah is like the Radiohead of Soul music. After her introduction to the world on the multi platinum, multi Grammy winning \\"Baduizm\\", she went off on a different tangent, largely eschewing regular song structure for loose but intricately structured musical movements, and cerebral, often indiscernible lyrics.<br /><br />Her new 11 track CD is even more off kilter and uncommercial. It can best be described as a futuristic fusion of funk and jazz beamed from Mars, and I'm sure her record label Motown must have done the same head scratching it did ages ago when Marvin Gaye presented his magnum opus \\"What's going on\\" for release. To fully appreciate it, one has to put aside expectations of regular song structure and just go with the flow.<br /><br />Opening cut \\"Amerykhan promise\\" sounds like the soundtrack to some seventies blaxploitation movie with alternating male narration and female harmonies set to a funky bassline and interspersed with horns. One can almost see the women with their huge afros and platforms going \\"I promise, I promise\\". \\"The healer/hip hop\\" has a haunting feel with chiming triangles, an echoing choir, and lyrics proclaiming hip hop to be \\"bigger than religion or the government\\".<br /><br />The autobiographical \\"Me\\" is one of the more straightforward sounding songs (sprawling and lacking a formal chorus, as does almost every other song); muted sax gently floating against a breezy seventies Marvin Gaye sound, and deeply personal lyrics like \\"Had two babies, different dudes/ and thought for both my love was true ... hey, that's me.\\", ending in a vocals/sax duet.<br /><br />\\"My people\\" is a hypnotic sounding song with a skeletal groove, gentle percussion, tribal sounding chants and sparse singing extorting black people to \\"keep on moving on\\", with a brief Martin Luther King excerpt ending it. Another more easily accessible song is \\"Soldier\\" with rumbling hip hop beats, ghostly harmonising and lyrics touching on black on black violence, Katrina and other issues, while some male vocal exclaims \\"Uh\\" and \\"Hah\\" intermittently.  \\"The cell\\" is jazz fusion with semi spoken lyrics touching on a \\"mama hopped up on cocaine\\" and ending acappella.<br /><br />\\"Twinkle\\" rumbles along gently with skittery beats and a constant twinkling sound, electronic effects and disembodied harmonies, the final two or so minutes of the almost seven minutes is spent with some male voice telling us of the dire state of the times (after some strange voice speaking in what sounds somewhat like South African click, or is it a transmission from Mars??) against an eerie string backdrop. Talk about off kilter!<br /><br />\\"Master teacher\\" is a woozy, psychedelic sounding groove which shifts tempo midway into a lilting piano sprinkled jazz piece with subtle electronic flourishes. \\"That hump\\" is a shimmery sounding midtempo song with a creeping bassline, a chorus of sorts, and a very nice horn sprinkled Motown-like bridge. The meandering eight minute long \\"Telephone\\" is a tribute to the late producer J Dilla. \\"Just fly away to heaven brother, make a place for me\\" she sings against a gently floating jazzy backdrop (dreamy harmonies, gentle hand percussion, and fleeting horns with muted hand claps coming in towards the final two minutes).<br /><br />This CD might be bewildering at first, there is simply nothing else out there that sounds like it, but it is one that with time some will go, \\"Oh, now I get it!\\" while others never will. I see this making many end of year best album lists (it's on mine already), as well as Ms Badu making some more room in her Grammy cabinet.of year best album lists (it's on mine already), as well as Ms Badu making some more room in her Grammy cabinet.
B00005B4GU|2.0|I must preface this by saying that I am a huge Radiohead fan. I'm also a fan of all types of music and always open to hearing new sounds.  The one thing I require is a semblance of a melody.  You are not going to convince me that noise (although well put together) is a substitue for tunefulness.   Some of the songs on this album are interesting as a peek at some very intelligent musical experimentation, but should not, under any circumstance, be confused with anything remotely enjoyable. The \\"emperor's new clothes\\" tag that some Radiohead fans get is dead on.  Not only in the case of this album, but also in that other lovely invisible coat of the emperor's, Kid A.  The flipside to all that reverence is the (undeserved) disdain towards Pablo Honey.     My two cents on Radiohead's records:    \\"The Bends\\" is a masterpiece.  Beautifuly crafted music, soulful lyrics, all masterfuly executed.  Every single song works.  If you don't own this already, please do yourself a favor and go out and get it.     \\"OK computer\\" is a great, innovative album.  The first five songs are truly without reproach.  \\"Fitter Happier\\" is an annoyance and I'm not really thrilled with the back end of the album (\\"Lucky\\" is a good song), but at least, all the songs are interesting and at the very least melodic.  The two records that followed were not.     Kid A has two good songs. \\"The National Anthem\\" and \\"Idiotheque\\".    Amnesiac has two great songs in \\"I Might be Wrong\\" and \\"Knives Out\\" and a very good one in \\"Pyramid Song\\".      The rest of these two albums is the result of brilliant minds searching for the next musical evolutionary step. Unfortunately they come up with dense, sometimes interesting, but never quite enjoyable noise instead.      \\"Hail to the Thief\\" has \\"2+2+5\\", and \\"A Wolf at the Door\\", which are excellent songs and book end a mediocre record.      \\"In Rainbows\\" is a much more accesible effort form the band and a hell of a lot more enjoyable than \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\". \\"15 Step\\" and \\"Bodynatchers\\" are very good songs, and \\"Weird Fishes\\", \\"Faust Arp\\", \\"Reckoner\\",  \\"House of Cards\\" and \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place\\" are all solid songs. The kind of Radiohead songs that burrow their way in.     Finally, \\"Pablo Honey\\". In my opinion an excellent album.  Dismissed by Radiohead snobs because of its accessibility and straightfowardness.   It contains their most popular song and nary an experimental noise track, which puts off the pretentious bunch that like listening to music that is above the masses.  Truth is that \\"Blow Out\\", \\"Lurgee\\", \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\", \\"Ripcord\\" and \\"How Do You Do?\\" are great rock songs.  The fact of the matter is that most people want something they can jam to and not some repetitive bullcrap chanting to a techno loop (unless they are really, really stoned).      Call it what it is. Amnesiac is a self indulgent experimental record by a band bored with conventional rock and roll.   I however, am not bored with rock and roll.  I am bored by Amnesiac.
B0011FXLCC|5.0|UK glam electronic duo Goldfrapp is back, and with a new sound on their fourth album. Out go the stomping beats of the last two albums (\\"Black cherry\\" and \\"Supernature\\"), and in come lots of acoustic guitar against a chilled swirling ambient soundscape, a move sure to send those expecting disco lights and balls heading for the hills. Those who like Kate Bush, Kate Havnevik or Bj&ouml;rk will be embracing this with maniacal glee.<br /><br />\\"Seventh Tree\\" is the follow up to their UK #2 Grammy nominated album \\"Supernature\\". Right from the delicately strummed guitars, ethereal vocals and haunting strings of the percussion free opening cut \\"Clowns\\", the atmosphere is one of gently floating away. \\"Little bird\\" is folk/electronica with sparse guitars and electronic flourishes ebbing and flowing, and percussion filtering in towards the end.<br /><br />\\"Happiness\\" features delicate percussion initially which builds up as the song progresses, it has a nice swinging feel and is one of a pair of (the most) upbeat numbers. \\"Road to somewhere\\" is a gentle acoustic ballad with lilting beats, a faint bassline and an almost Oriental feel. \\"Eat yourself\\" is another acoustic ballad with instruments gradually building up with angelic sounding harmonies. Similar is the shimmery \\"Some people\\".<br /><br />Lead-off single \\"A&E\\" is a gently pulsing acoustic song which vaguely reminds me of Cyndi Lauper's \\"All through the night\\", albeit a more sombre version. Surprisingly, it has made the UK top 10, surprising as it is beautiful but so uncommercial. The sweeping \\"Cologne Cerrone Houdini\\" is a beautiful dreamy ballad that sounds like it should be the next James Bond theme song. The other upbeat song is the poppy Cranberries-style \\"Caravan girl\\" with gently jangly guitars (it's almost as though they are afraid they will wake you up), and closing is the gentle acoustic \\"Monster love\\" with swirling electronic effects and an almost hymnal feel.<br /><br />Lots of haunting or angelic harmonies, a stripped down dreamy acoustic sound garnished with swirling synths and electronic effects. Goldfrapp have made music, not for the feet this time, but for the heart.d garnished with swirling synths and electronic effects.

B0012K1ILW|5.0|I've been a devoted Badu from the gate and with each album, she has drawn herself away from the initial mass appeal she held with \\"On & On\\" from Baduizm.  Mama's Gun, the follow-up to Baduizm, showed rumblings of Erykah's funky side and with her newest release \\"New Amerykah\\", it has been fully realized.      This is also her most overtly political album to date and it is the more inspiring because of that.  For those fearing that Badu would soften and get boring over the years, fear not!  She is stronger, stranger and deeper than ever before.  This album is a knock-out, making the album cover VERY appropriate!    Favorite track (after ONLY two full listens) is: The Cell.    FIVE STARS!  Don't sleep on Badu--get this album NOW!
B0011FDVKE|5.0|\\"Another Country\\" sounded familiar, but I just couldn't place where I'd heard it before. A clear-voiced singer, sensitive lyrics, music that alternately chugged and soared. Joni Mitchell? Emmylou Harris? Damned if I could place her.<br /><br />A few listenings in, Tift Merritt's lineage no longer mattered. Only the music did. I didn't immediately get the words --- they're about love and loss and distance, and because they're charming and poetic, they go down easy --- but the tunes were fatally catchy. I found myself humming along and calling out the refrains. Not like me.<br /><br />My reaction to Tift Merritt was also unsettling. She's got a Grammy nomination and praise from the likes of Emmylou Harris on her bio, but she seems more like a kid just starting out than a seasoned artist. In her 30s? With her own show on NPR? For that matter, a year in Paris? No way.<br /><br />I had a bunch of questions. Ms. Merritt had the answers. And then some.<br /><br />JK: What were you doing five minutes before you decided to go to Paris and write the songs that became this CD?<br /><br />TM: I'd been on tour for a year, traveling in a van --- five guys and me --- and sometimes playing empty clubs, where you have to pretend everything's okay and cry in private. And you get ready in a rock `n roll dressing room, with graffiti on the walls and scary corners you can't look in. And you see the irony. How could you not, when you put your makeup on looking into a mirror that says MILLER LITE.<br /><br />JK: Who do you blame?<br /><br />TM: It always ends with me.<br /><br />JK: And the moment of decision?<br /><br />TM: I was going to England to tour. I thought, `I'm a grown woman. I can go to Paris and get an apartment and a piano.'<br /><br />JK: Parlez-vous français?<br /><br />TM: I studied French in school. And I'd always had a connection to France; my first crush was on my third grade French teacher. I'd say I understood French as I understand music --- instinctively.<br /><br />JK: No sane person could like French rock. What did you listen to in Paris?<br /><br />TM: I was cut off from most music. I had some music on my computer, but no iPod.<br /><br />JK: Did you have any connections to French musicians and writers?<br /><br />TM: No. And that didn't change much --- I was mostly anonymous. I didn't dress up and go out. I just wrote what I experienced day-to-day, which was the first time in a long time that I'd done that. And to do that in the most beautiful city in the world! In Paris, they spend four hours on a dress the way I spend four hours on a line. The windows are open, people live in the street, you get little glimpses of their lives. And it's very comfortable to be a woman alone there --- you feel safe.<br /><br />JK: What was your day like?<br /><br />TM: I didn't think what I was doing. I took pictures, wrote, sang. It was all a nice surprise.<br /><br />JK: You've written about a day when you filled page after page. Should I be jealous?<br /><br />TM: I was tired. I'd finished a lot of writing, and I felt like I'd overshot it --- you come back to real life and find yourself crossing against the lights and staring blankly at vegetables in the market because all your perspective is used up.<br /><br />JK: I'd start feeling paranoid about what's on my computer: What if...<br /><br />TM: I saved everything to disks --- even though my writing was a mess --- and mailed them home.<br /><br />JK: Ah, yes: home. What was it like to return to America?<br /><br />TM: In Paris, I'd been happy just doing my job. I was nervous I'd lose that feeling.<br /><br />JK: And?<br /><br />TM: It's hard. I came home and the record company dropped me. It was really lucky that I had these songs to take care of. But the way it happened, the songs took care of me.<br /><br />JK: How?<br /><br />TM: I believed in them, and it's sometimes easier to believe in your work than to believe in yourself. I'd started to think: This is stupid. I don't need an audience to be happy. I'm traipsing around the country. Not doing much to save the world. Maybe I should do something else. But I kept coming back to the songs. I needed to follow through --- and I knew I wouldn't get off so easily. And then I teamed up with Fantasy, and here we are.<br /><br />JK: \\"Another Country\\" is hard to categorize.<br /><br />TM: Thank you.<br /><br />JK: Yes, but you make it hard for yourself.<br /><br />TM: I don't sit around and choose to make this music. I do this because it's real. Do critics do this to filmmakers --- put the funny ones in the comedy box? I think it's crazy for me to edit myself so I can make it easy for others.<br /><br />JK: What are you like on stage?<br /><br />TM: Performing is a safe place for me to throw my intensity, as hard as I want.<br /><br />JK: I'm having trouble imagining that.

0452289963|5.0|I just finished this book and wanted to read the reviews on Amazon about it.  But I was dismayed to see some readers commenting that after reading the reviews they thought as Christians the book wouldn't help them with their spiritual lives and they were deciding against buying it. I am writing urging them to not miss out on this fabulous book.  IMO Eckhardt is spreading the message of Jesus in a new way that jives with our modern understanding of the human mind and psyche. There is no threat or fear to your faith from someone who sums up his book by urging us to mold our psyches into what Jesus wants: to be the blessed and meek of the earth.  To be egoless.  As a result of losing our ego we will be closer to the heaven that is already within each and everyone of us.     Some of my favorite statements in the book are the way Tolle is able to use the very words of Jesus as the basis for his call to quiet the thoughts of man to make room in our minds to be with God.  There is nothing in this book that leads a Christian away from God.  Instead Tolle is urging us back to the God that is within all of us.      Now this one book alone is not a replacement for the many years of spiritual study since the birth of Christ. If you are a fundamentalist only concerned with convincing people to \\"accept Christ\\" then you won't find that message here. But I think you can love Jesus and love what Eckhart Tolle has written too.   I fully believe that people such as Eckhardt Tolle are one of the ways God is using to help us find our way back to him using our advancing knowledge of the human mind and psyche.  If we become quiet and be more with God we will be more one with God.  And if we are one with God, then we will be what God wants us to be.  And that is our true purpose.

B000YF86JS|5.0|I was introduced to Taylor Swift's music when I heard her song Tim McGraw on the radio.  It's a beautiful song and story.  In a way, Swift sort of reminds me of Jewel's old music, but slightly more country sounding, slightly less folk.  She has similar vocalization in her voice.<br /><br />Her lyrics are refreshing and rather deep, especially for love/love lost songs (again, rather Jewel-esque).  I am still incredibly impressed that she writes her songs herself (with help, sure; but it's mostly her writing).  She has a lot of sad songs on this CD, but it's more of a bittersweet sad, not a \\"pity me\\" sad that seems to float around a lot these days.<br /><br />The CD also has a ton of good tracks.  Out of this CD, my favorite tracks are (in the order they are on the CD) Tim McGraw, Picture To Burn, Teardrops On My Guitar, A Place In This World, Cold As You, The Outside, Stay Beautiful, and I'm Only Me When I'm With You.

I wasn't crazy about her style or narrative. She seemed a bit self aborbed and superficial. Yes, I get that its her own observations and experiences but most of the time, I felt like 'get over yourself already'. People deal with broken hearts every day and don't have this much drama. Its as much the time that heals as anything that you 'do'. It was a pass to me - I wouldn't recommend it.
B0000A02TZ|4.0|The comedy of a generation takes place at Faber College during the Kennedy era. Delta House is the worst fraternity on campus. Its members are known for sex, drinking and bad grades. The assortment of misfits is recognizable. John Belushi is the class clown: \\"7 years of college down the drain!\\" Otter is the ladies' man who beds the dean's wife. Neidermeyer is the gung ho ROTC officer: \\"Drop and give me 20!\\" Boone and Katy are the incompatible couple. Donald Sutherland is the English teacher having an affair with Katy. Dean Wormer's attempt to crack down on Delta is in vain. They simply go on a road trip or have a toga party. Even the statue of the college founder is funny: \\"Knowledge is good.\\"
B0012K1ILW|2.0|Erykah Badu's new CD reminds me of D'Angelo's \\"Voodoo\\" in that it exists as sonic meditation. D'Angelo's debut also had a hypnotic vibe to it, but it balanced the commercial with his vision. Then, on \\"Voodoo,\\" he joined with Questlove, whose drumming skills pretty much drove the album's sound. It was an artistic statement for sure, but one has to be in a specific mood and mindset to appreciate. I'm all for artists following their vision, making an album and not trying to appease the mainstream, but an album still has to be enjoyable. The downside to artists these days is that it seems being an artist entails making low-key, rhythm-driven music that's ultra mellow and exhibits a stream-of-consciousness vibe.   That can be appreciated in doses, but, that somewhat strays from what makes music powerful. Such music, even when done well, can come off as ultra self-conscious. R.E.M. has been making such music for years, and while solid, it just feels cold.  Erykah Badu makes warm music, but this new CD seems like it will sit right next to D'Angelo's \\"Voodoo\\" as an album one can respect, but doesn't listen to that much.   I'm not saying go out and buy the latest Britney Spears slice of shallow pop, but Badu's album seems to demand too many factors to be in place to enjoy it. Even the \\"geniuses\\" in music's past offered enough balance of artistic vision and enjoyability.   Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\" is held up as pure artistic vision, but it also balances his vision with a melodic sound that incorporates commercial elements.   Both Badu and D'Angelo need to clear out some of the smoky haze from their albums and offer a little something more for their fans. Sure, I understand artists do things out of their own desire and whims, and that's fine, but if you're going to put out an album, I don't think there's anything wrong in the potential audience wanting something that they can enjoy on a more topical level.  In other words, sometimes I want some \\"fun\\" with the artistry,\\"finger snapping\\" with the socially conscious message, and something more than cerebral musings over mellow, smoky vibes.   The most remembered songs and albums achieve such a balance.   And I believe Erykah Badu can achieve it again, without making \\"Baduizm Part Two.\\"

But at the end I realized that I loved each of them for different reasons.  They are both amazingly fun stories that take you someplace else.  I was sorry that the story ended.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This is a must have for any fan of LOST.  It is the best show on TV and season 3 was probably one of the best.
B0012K1ILW|3.0|Wow...this is not exactly what I was expecting to hear after so many years. It seems as though Ms. Badu is pushing her music in a different direction, which is cool. Perhaps this can be the push that drives music into a more diversified direction. Only wish she incorporated more obvious live instrumentation into the music. Even still, solid disc.

0143038419|1.0|Gilbert comes across like a narcissistic dilettante, dabbling a little here and there for her own distraction. I did find the idea of following your dream inspiring, but her sanctimonious attitude toward those she meets and the places she visits was not appealing. If you walk into a country, flash a lot of money and act like the \\"big white savior\\" why would you be surprised and put off when people ask for more? Having lots of money (at least by local standards) available to her and using it to set herself above the rules when she wants to does not show sensitivity, compassion or respect. Being friends with the old man until you find a hot lover does not show loyalty. Having a hallucinogenic experience while meditating does not signal enlightenment. And repeatedly documenting for  your readers when someone tells you how beautiful you are is tiring. Yawn, we get it: you are fabulous and blonde and lucky and enlightened and eat great food, collect exotic friends and exempt from the rules. Got it. Yawn.

This book really lives up to its best seller status.  Even many of the advanced brewers that I know still refer back to this book for its charts and information.  Well worth any amount in order to have the information.

B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|This past September we went to Las Vegas and this show wasn't playing the days we were there. I was so disappointed since it was her last year and all.  When I saw this DVD I didn't think it would have been an experience watching it.  It was so entertaining and the sets were amazing.  Bonus features take you behind the scenes and behind the creation that is her music and Cir Du Soleil. I have had two sets of friends come over and its like we are at the concert. The arena is HUGE and you really get the sense you are there.  It is something you will enjoy again and again...I put it on when I am cleaning around the house too.

B000I0QKDS|5.0|With a sound that could slice through steel, a mod haircut framing his slightly surly face, and a thorough immersion into the Yardbirds' blue-based rock, Beck was one tough muthuh, and he wasn't shy about letting us know that he could play \\"flash.\\" His pyrotechnical effects on \\"Truth\\" would be distracting if they weren't so spot on, almost always lifting the song to new, dazzling heights. It's a dazzling, exhilarating display of power, speed, showmanship, electronic effects, and simple good taste.<br /><br />This new reissue has all the core elements of the original \\"Truth,\\" (and here I diverge from the majority of reviewers), some mostly unnessary alternative versions--as well as songs not on the original. For example, it has the sublimely ridiculous, commercial, and pandering \\"Love is Blue\\" -Not even JEFF BECK can salvage this syrupy mosh. I believe that record producers were more powerful back then. You get two pretty awful tracks at the end of the album, and two good additons, \\"The Drinking Song,\\" (later popularized by Bette Midler), and a version of \\"Beck's Bolero\\" where the bubbling background guitar contrasts superbly with what today we would call \\"power chords.\\" It's both more evanescent and straightforward than the original, and worth a couple of dollars extra (though the \\"complete\\" Truth sells at about the same price as the 12-song original).<br /><br />Face it, though, this album is a classic on the basis of three rock classics, a re-working of the Yardies' \\"Shapes of Things\\" (Bowie does a more pop, but excellent version on \\"Pin-Ups\\"), with Rod Stewart's imaginative pronunciation and Beck's powerfully electric, piercing lead; \\"Morning Dew,\\" an apocalyptic number applicable to your choice of atom bombs, naplam, or greenhouse gases (Wikipedia will tell you that, indeed, it was a Bomb-inspired song written by Canadian Bonnie Dobson) with its combination of melodic and tempo-dissonant guitar licks as well as Stewart's best singing; and Beck's version of the great Howlin' Wolf's \\"I Ain't Superstitious,\\" a Beck-fest of wa-wa laden special effects that has never been equaled, with a bass run by the uncredited Ron Wood that was quite influential over the years. These are the standouts, and they're why this album is cherished and being picked up by a new generation.<br /><br />That popularity is NOT because this is the \\"Birth of Metal,\\" as some critics, anxious to sell something that doesn't need selling, will claim. This is the high point of blues-based rock, and the glorious, glorified guitar solo (is it only Prince these days who keeps that tradition alive?).  The album is too blues-laden to fit the \\"metal\\" category, and the playing blows away most metal bands anyway. Besides, \\"Truth\\" includes \\"Greensleeves\\" and \\"Old Man River\\"; the former is a sweet, but not necessary, and the latter is a showboat (pun intended) for Rod Stewart's intense and generally very effective singing.<br /><br />If you can get past later associations with Stewart (for example, the sickenly Playboy juvenalia of the \\"French girl\\" murmurs on his much later and much worse \\"Tonight's the Night\\") and his smug self-absorption, you can appreciate the raspy voice and confident swagger that make him a rich man's Joe Cocker. He shows nice restraint during the solos, adding a well-timed exclamation or improv here and there (e,g, \\"Listen!\\") which adds to the spontaneity. Stewart shows his R and B chops (and strong influences) on \\"Rock My Plimsoul\\" and his solid performances on Howlin's Wolf's \\"You  Shook Me\\" and 'Ain't Superstitious\\" are solid performances that appropriately lay out for Beck's insane guitar.<br /><br />One of my favorite moments occurs during Beck's solo during the live performance of \\"Blues De Luxe.\\" THe audience politely applauds him at first, but after he tears into an incredibly tight and intense solo, they lose whatever reserve they had and give him the frenzied appreciation he deserves.  It's an electirc guitar analogy to John Mayall's harp solo on \\"Room to Move.\\"<br /><br />Maybe you need an ego like Beck to play so well for so long. He states that Superstitious was stolen from a Howlin Wolf \\"riff\\" (with, we are told, Wolf's explicit permission). Well, really, he pretty much stole the whole song, although it's definitely a Jeff Beck treatment. He implores us to play the longs loudly \\"for maximum effect,\\" perhaps while having the \\"Vicar over for tea.\\" The boy is rude--I once heard a story about him screaming at an airplane steward for amother screwdriver (it might even be true), and he rocks like no one else. I'll take Hendrix as my favorite (and the best) rock guitarist, but flashy, stylish, slashing Jeff Beck is not too far behind. Definitely in my top ten rock albums ever; one I play nearly every day at work.be you need an ego like Beck to play so well for so long.

B00004R99U|3.0|To rate this movie fairly, I have to include both my opinion and that of my 3-year-old daughter.  To me, this film is pretty bad.  The original had great animation, great music, and a moving storyline.  The sequal has average animation, mostly bad music and a convoluted storyline that tries too hard to balance fact and fiction regarding the true story of Pocahontas.  BUT, my 3-year-old daughter, who loves the first Pocahontas as well, likes this one just as much.  She likes the fact that Pocahontas goes to England and gets all dressed up in a ball gown, making her look more like the other Disney princesses.  My daughter also doesn't seem to mind the lame jokes and the weird storyline that has Pocahontas winding up with someone other than the \\"prince\\" from the first movie.  So for adults like me, I'd rate it 2 stars.  My daughter would probably give it 4, so my official average rating is 3!
B00123AZ68|4.0|When it came to classic rock reunions, the hype seemed to really deliver from acts like The Police and many others. While some of those acts didn't really show their worth like Foreigner without Lou Gramm as the lead, others really were really worth the effort. That was the case with the surprising reunion of Genesis. After 15 years of the group performing without Phil Collins as lead, Mike Ruther ford and Tony banks tried it alone with ray Wilson on the haunting and dark Calling All Stations album in 1997. That was a good effort, but sadly didn't shine to new listeners or hard core fans. Last year, die hard fans got their reunion as Phil, Mike & Tony reunited as one for a surreal and definitive live performance at VH1's Rock Honors benefit, and reunited for a new tour in years.<br /><br />Live Over Europe, Genesis's first live album in over a decade, is finally available for listeners of all kinds. The album was taken from their many performances from their 2007 reunion tour, which delivered a deeper meaning in the say their songs sound. The double album includes many of their classics including Follow You, Follow Me, Hold On My Heart, all the way to guilty pleasures like Invisible Touch and the deep and haunting Home By The Sea. While Phil Collins voice and melody brings in a little older appeal, as is the tone of each song on the live album, the group still shows a never say die attitude with making a good songs last well, as is the case with their songs from the 70's they've recorded live like Ripples, Afterglow and Follow You Follow Me. The live tracks have all been remastered well from each of their many performances, and some sound better recorded now, but few of them you still wish were better from years ago.<br /><br />All in all, while Live Over Europe isn't a definitive buy for newcomers to Genesis and their classic influential Rock sound, as was the case with other records like the 2007 expanded Turn It On Again: The Hits (Tour Edition), it still shows a decent performance that the trio have made and delivered well from each of their concerts for the first times in years. I just hope that the group can also manage to make a new studio album to turn on new fans to again.<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Remastered: B<br /><br />Overall: B-nce that the trio have made and delivered well from each of their concerts for the first times in years.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|excellent movie.. if you haven't yet seen the first 2, you will still enjoy the energy and excitement of this third installment. I do recommend that you view the first two first, but if you can't then watch this one, it will draw you to the first two!

B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I bought this calculator model in 1984 while I was in college and it still works. It has excellent quality.  My more recent experiences with equipment from HP have been dreadful, to the point that I will not buy anything from HP anymore. Therefore, I don't know if a model of this calculator built in more recent times will be any good.  This calculator has a little of a learning curve since first you have to enter the numbers and you enter the operation last.

I was a little lost at first.. but that didn't last long and everything clicked, making complete sense. If you watched the first two you should check out the third.

The story is a great adventure and for those looking for something deeper it can give them a lot to think about.  I am enjoying them very much and would recommend it to anyone!
B000YYQFHO|5.0|This is a great movie that postulates that the smallest actions we take in any given day can change multitudes of other things in our and other people's lives. The story is of a young man that had experienced blackouts as a child. He would read the journals he kept as a child and flash back to the time he was reading about, always filling in the blanks of what had occured during the fashbacks. He would then change something he did during those times and it changed around his future.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Gosling and Hopkins are top notch, as has already been said, and there is very, very little to find fault with elsewhaere, except that little matter of the double jeopardy.... indeed, the filmmakers must know that their core audience are slueth and legal thriller savvy, so why have Gosling's Willy look it up? The only other flaw I can find is why would the judge dad to the partner Willy slept with be so willing to help Gosling after he was fired by the bigtime lawfirm and dumped by said daughter? HMMM now theres a real mystery. Other than these two very minor glitches, I can find no other reason not to watch this brilliantly constructed character play between Gosling and Hopkins. I tore scenes apart over and over in my head looking for some shred of something I thought I missed, trying to come up with how the murder weapon disappeared when it clearly couldn't have. All I can say for the writers is, brilliant, absolutely brilliant. I know there is no such thing as an absolutely perfect thriller of this type when we the viewers have been subjected to SO much of this vein, but you can't come closer to utopia than Fracture. 4.75 stars
B000EQ46FA|2.0|Let me begin by saying that I love Depeche Mode, and this is one of their best albums IMHO. Unfortunately, this remaster is like so many others from the 80s with a bloated mastering level and squashed dynamic range. Compared with the original CD it sounds thin and fatiguing. Maybe this is a conscious effort on the part of record producers to make the sound more friendly to compression to MP3 format or to listening on a portable device with really poor earbuds. However, when played on a high performance system the sound really suffers. Listeners are encouraged to check out this phenomenon [...]. Do yourself a favor and hold on dearly to the original CD. It sounds much more potent and involving. The same goes for other remastered music from the great 80s. Regard the remasters with a healthy dose of skepticism. Rock on!

B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille is a touching story about Remy, a culinary rat who gets separated from his family and ends up finding his gift to create delectable dishes in Gusteau's upscale restaurant in Paris. He finds help from an inner voice belonging to Aguste Gusteau, departed chef and owner of the restaurant, and Linguini, a recent hire to the kitchen staff. The film touches on the wonders of delectable tastes and the gift that is in every person to pursue a dream, whether it's to find one's unique contribution, or to connect with the person who will add the spice of life.<br /><br />Pixar cooks up a story with wonderful flair. You see every detail rendered in rich texture. They bring such a wide palette of color and nuance to every scene, you can almost smell the aromas of herbs and spices in every dish. There's plenty to come back to, so you'll enjoy seeing it time after time with your family. The extra features too are original, sparing no effort to provide a feast for your eyes, mind, and heart.

The Camel Club grows on me and together with Annabelle in Stone Cold- they are simply irresistible ! The way David Baldacci describes his characters are amazing. I have read almost all his books and he is my favorite followed by Ken Follett and John Grisham.
B000ESSTL0|2.0|Depeche Mode are of course awesome, and this is one of their best albums. That being said, this CD remaster doesn't make the cut. It's another example of high sound levels and squashed dynamics. The result is bloated yet thin and fatiguing sound. The original CD is more visceral and exciting. If you're mainly interested in the remastered CD, DO NOT pick this up. This type of mastering/remastering that has arisen over the past several years is a real problem for people who appreciate the highest quality playback of recorded music. There are many including recording engineers who think it's a huge step backward. Hopefully this is part of a cycle, and the trend will reverse. I've noticed this poor quality on at least two other Rhino remasters: INXS greatest hits and Foreigner greatest hits. It appears that one should steer clear of Rhino reissues of music from this era.    This product isn't all bad, though. The DVD has some interesting interviews with DM, and the surround mixes are worth. However, you'll have to decide if the price is justified.

B0011FXLCC|5.0|I confess, I'm still getting used to the glitzy, glammy sound Goldfrapp had in its last album. Now it has gone to the other extreme -- floaty, instrumental pop.<br /><br />Fortunately it doesn't take long to get used to this new style, because it fits Goldfrapp like a fine silk glove.The dancy electrobeats are translated into shimmering downtempo, the hard edges softened into acoustics -- it's a floaty, dreamlike, bittersweetly beautiful little album, full of swirlingly addictive instrumentation and wistful vocals.<br /><br />It opens with the mellow rippling guitar, overlaid with an ethereal fog of sorrowful violins, a touch of synth, clips of birds singing happily. \\"Only clowns would play with dull balloons,\\" Alison Goldfrapp sings in a girlish slur. It's pretty hard to hear what's she singing (\\"Roasting, roasting, roast indeed, mahogany\\"), but the exquisite quality of the music makes up for it.<br /><br />This is where you know it's all going to work.<br /><br />And she doesn't disappoint in the songs after, startling with the quivering synth and satiny vocals of \\"Little Bird\\" (\\"We dance by the sea/the land of blue and gold/is where we were free/do you lie, lie lie?\\") and catchy, sunny \\"Happiness.\\" And it sets the tone for some of the songs that follow -- exquisitely sensuous pop melodies, odd chorale ballads, dramatic electronica, and the sprightly dancy chamberpop of \\"Caravan Girl.\\"<br /><br />The highlight has to be \\"A&E,\\" a warm fragile little melody spun that ripples with piano and soft keyboard. And as the melody picks up into a swirling instrumental speckled with electronic blips, the tone turns a bit darker. \\"I was trying to phone you when I'm crawling out the door.... I was feeling lonely, feeling blue/Feeling like I needed you/Like I've woken up surrounded by me/A&E...\\"<br /><br />Most bands can't pull off a total change of sound -- they're going to disappoint a lot of, and often the quality of their music suffers because they're simply not used to this style. Fortunately Goldfrapp is not one of those bands -- it's hard to imagine anyone being turned off by the lush, bittersweet sound of this album.<br /><br />The songs are spun out of a lot of acoustic instruments -- waves of elegant strings and a low-key piano, with some acoustic guitar and jazzy drums to keep the melodies grounded. But they haven't totally abandoned electronica -- there's a trip-hoppy downtempo flavour to these songs, mostly expressed in warm, misty synth that gently wraps around the chamberpop and folky melodies. But you do get some kooky catchy organ again toward the end.<br /><br />And Alison Goldfrapp sounds like she's having fun. Her flexible, silky voice can become whatever the melody requires of her -- girly slurring, terrifying perkiness (\\"We're here to welcome you!\\"), an otherworldly balladeer -- but most of the time she sounds lovelorn and wistful.<br /><br />And while the music may be more accessible, the songs she sings are flavoured with depression, moments stolen with a lover you'll never really have, and even drug overdoses (\\"It's a blue, bright blue Saturday, hey hey/And the pain has started to slip away/I'm in a backless dress on a pastel ward that's shining/Think I want you still/But it may be pills at work\\").<br /><br />Goldfrapp have really outdone themselves in the shimmering, exquisite \\"Seventh Tree,\\" a sharp deviation from their previous music.

B00004SW9R|5.0|There has always been something primative and haunting about Dr. Johns music, it is a peek into a very complex and unique culture. This is an album that I went to a New Years Eve concert in Phoenix to see in the 70's and never forgot the magic. This CD is just how I remembered it and is fast becoming one of my favorites. PFM

B00000IMYA|5.0|Frankly, I tend to agree with the reviewers who think there's simply too much ambiance noises and announcements collected here; perhaps the earlier studio dominated version was not such a bad idea?<br />But, than again, for as Ellington fan(atic)s it is absolutely essential to know all the fascinating details from the booklet and to hear how it all sounded at the spot...<br /><br />This is not only highly pleasant but also historical album, although (I tend to agree with that as well) the band actually had better nights; Gonsalves' showcase is the only musically remarkable spot. But (another but), an B+ performance from Ellington's band is worth an \\"A\\" grade in any other band's book, so this is the right album to buy if you're already initiated into the Ellingtonia treasure.<br />The beginners might start with [[ASIN:B0000026I2 Duke Ellington: Blues in Orbit (Columbia Jazz Masterpieces)]] or, for instance, [[ASIN:B0001CCYA6 Ellington Uptown]]...
B00004ZBVG|5.0|Terrific Vietnam War movie, based on a true story, which likely heightens its authenticity. Col. Hamilton (Hackman) is called off the golf course to help formulate a carpet bombing campaign against the Viet-Cong along the Ho Chi-Minh trail. He's quickly shot down on a premptive mission and is forced to bail out into the very area that's to be saturated. Capt. Clark (Glover0 literally keeps the Colonel alive through psychology, intensive surveillance, and strategic gunfire. Finally, after watching several apparently authentic real- life horror shows,Glover disobeys orders, and commandeers a helicopter of World War 2 vintage. He locates the colonel, picks him up, is shot down, and the two Amricans srruggle to reach the safety of the river and eventual rescue,barely avoiding the \\"friendly \\" fire. This movie is a hidden gem. Try to watch it.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|One word...Incredible.  Don't listen to this CD one time and dismiss it, especially if you are a fan of Baduizm only.  This is meant to be eaten, ingested, and regurgitated so you can smell the funk!!  This is what music in 2008...3008 is supposed to sound like.  Funky, intelligent, boundary pushing, head nodding, perfection!  Sit back and enjoy the ride!  I give this 10 stars!!!  Best album of the decade.  And best of all...there's 2 more to go in the series!
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This is a wonderful adaptation of one of Austen's best novels. The young cast is excellent, and portray their characters superbly. Utterly convincing and enjoyable. I will never grow tired of this dvd! Highly recommended.
B000RZGFYS|3.0|I really like the instrumentals this band has to offer...they'd be a really good band in my estimation if they would lose the vocals...    In most instances the vocals seemed forced and rather unimaginative...blood, death, Satan, blah, blah, blah...I guess SLAYER just wouldn't be the same without the lyrics though...who would fundamentalist Christians have to complain about...    If I could buy the album without the vocals it would get 5 stars.
B00007LTIG|4.0|I was never a Deadhead. In fact I was somewhat despised by some due to my love of Iggy and the Stooges. I had much fun turning deadheads on to \\"Raw Power\\" at parties and watching their extreme reactions-(incredible how mad some would become-it wasn't all Peace and Love back then)-oh those High School Days! Anyway,I always had a soft spot for \\"Morning Dew\\" and \\"New,New Minglewood Blues\\" on this album but I always found the horrible LP sound to be unlistenable.I tried the original CD release and it sounded just as bad. So I got this remastered version and I love it. The sound is great and the bonus tracks like \\"Alice D.Millionaire\\" and others are incredible. I myself is for the most part a sixties music maniac nowadays with all the excellent releases in that genre and now this one can join the other fantastic garage rock and Psychedelia remasters,finally!

And since this is sci-fi, complete with time travel, there's no reason that history (even future history) can't be re-written.<br /><br />To the folks who think the action is \\"great...for a t.v. show,\\" I can only assume they haven't been watching t.v. in the last 10 years or so.  There have been several shows that far eclipse what is being done in movies (Buffy, Alias, two more girl-power shows just off the top of my head).<br /><br />What really surprised me about the show is how faithful it is to the first and second movies.  In just this shortened (9 episodes) first season, we've seen the following characters from the films appear: Miles Dyson's widow and son, Dr. Silverman, Enrique and Kyle Reese.<br /><br />As for the cast, Lena Headly is no Linda Hamilton, but her voice-overs became more and more convincing and even poignant as the episodes progressed.  And of course, what sci-fi geek didn't salivate over the news of [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]]'s Summer Glau being cast in the pivotal role of female cyborg Cameron.  And considering John Connor has been played by 3 different actors, Thomas Decker acquits himself quite well.  He's less irritating than Edward Furlong, by a long shot.<br /><br />If the show has a flaw, it's that at times it does feel a little too familiar.  One has to wonder how long the writers will be able to sustain Sarah and John's journey, without really damaging the integrity of the film series.  And I realize CGI is the norm for special effects these days, but give me a REAL metal (or at least plastic that looks like metal) endoskeleton over this computer-generated mess any day.<br /><br />I think The Sarah Connor Chronicles is a fine continuation of the Terminator universe.  No, it's not that rare series that's actually BETTER than the movies (OK, it's not THAT rare in sci-fi...see [[ASIN:B000TJBNHQ Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series Collection]] or [[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)]]), but it's certainly among the best t.v. adaptations of movie storyline.  With great casting, well-executed action, and suprisingly intelligent writing, it's a winner.movies (OK, it's not THAT rare in sci-fi...see [[ASIN:B000TJBNHQ Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series Collection]] or [[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)]]), but it's certainly among the best t.v. adaptations of movie storyline.

1594489505|5.0|Seldom do I find myself verbally reacting to books while I read them. But the final quarter of this amazing novel had me yelling out advice and encouragement to Mariam and Laila, as if they could hear me. As if I could help, which is what you want to do as you experience the lives of these two strong women. I thought The Kite Runner was excellent, but Hosseini's second effort is even better.<br /><br />I'm curious about the fact that Hosseini switches to present tense in Part Four. Maybe his reasoning is addressed in one of these many reviews or in an author interview somewhere, but I'd love to know why that choice was made. Certainly the section feels more immediate, more promising with regard to survival.<br /><br />I think this is the finest book I've read over the past year, and I recommend it highly.

0380002930|5.0|I can remember years ago as a teenager seeing this paperback in a local bookstore and being intrigued by its warm, lovely cover art.  Picking it up, I read the plot synopsis on the back cover, but couldn't at the time fathom from the description that the characters in the book were all rabbits.  I didn't think much about reading it until a guy I had a crush on did a book report for it in our 8th grade English class.  Upon hearing his praise and high recommendation, I bought it soon afterwards.... and was immediately entranced/blown away by a masterful, powerful tale of a band of brave rabbits who leave their endangered home in search of a new residence safe from harm and untouched by humans. I couldn't put the novel down if I'd tried!!  \\"Watership Down\\" remains to this day one of my all time favorite books, and I would have to add that Richard Adams is one author who I have held in the highest regard for 20+ years.  Few other authors have left such a huge impression upon me as he has with this amazing tale of love, hope, sheer terror, survival, loyalty, tenacity, intelligence, wit, and trust.  Each character is distinct in the way they think, act, etc., that after a time, I nearly forgot that I was reading about rabbits.  Adams really fleshes out their personalities brilliantly and makes you genuinely care about their struggles and triumphs.  There was an animated movie that came out in the 1980's that was quite good and followed the book for the most part (the film is also accompanied by a breathtakingly beautiful soundtrack that fits the feel/themes of the story perfectly).  However, I would very much recommend readling the book first as it is still superior, and also goes into quite a bit more detail regarding the rabbits' own unique language, folklore, and religion (of sorts).  The book (and movie) both moved me to tears when I reached the ending, but I was left with a great feeling afterwards nonetheless.  \\"Watership Down\\" is a fantastic portrayal of spirit, determination in the wake of adversity/destruction/death.  I love this book immensely and it effected me in ways that few reads rarely have.

B00003CXXS|2.0|BOTTOM LINE:    This movie sucked! The story was ridiculous and the movie completely lost all of its magic. Even with the Pteradactyls it didn't work.

B0007MAO0M|3.0|Released in 1985, &#34;Silverado&#34; is a Western about two brothers (Scott Glenn & Kevin Costner) and two other gents (Kevin Kline & Danny Glover) who become friends and ultimately team-up to take on the corrupt sheriff of the New Mexican town Silverado.<br /><br />The first time I watched &#34;Silverado&#34; was in the mid-90s and I was turned off by the implausibility of the prison break scene in the first act, not to mention the nigh goofiness of Costner’s character. There’s an unrealistic vibe, almost verging on Indiana Jones territory, which is easy to explain since writer/director Lawrence Kasdan also wrote &#34;Raiders of the Lost Ark&#34; (1981). So it’s necessary to accept the implausible heroics to glean from (and enjoy) the meat of the picture, which is essentially a serious story running the gamut of the human condition (e.g. injustice, action, drama, comedy, conflict, etc.).<br /><br />I only bring this up so that viewers who favor realism in their Westerns, like “Shane” (1953), &#34;True Grit” (1969/2010), “The Long Riders” (1980), “Unforgiven” (1992) or “Wyatt Earp” (1994), will make the necessary mental adjustments before attempting to digest the film. &#34;Silverado&#34; is a rip-roaring, rollicking Western in the truest sense. There are a few moral ambiguities (e.g. Jeff Goldblum's character and Paden’s conundrum in the story) but, for the most part, the heroes are heroes and the villains drip with evil.<br /><br />One aspect of &#34;Silverado&#34; I like, which most post-50s Westerns lack, is the palpable spirit of life, liberty and joy that the heroes & their friends possess. Despite the various evils they experience (which we can all relate to one way or another) they maintain a certain joy of living, the jubilance of life and freedom itself. As such, the film isn't a downer; it's somehow uplifting.<br /><br />Stories like this need a good villain and Brian Dennehy more than fills the bill. He's almost horrifying as the swaggering corrupt sheriff of Silverado. Remember his part as the sheriff in &#34;First Blood&#34; (1982)? This is essentially the same role, just exponentially WORSE.<br /><br />The main hero is Kline as Paden. Kline is effective at playing the perfect, likable everyman. Glenn is a quintessential Westerner as Emmett while Costner plays his younger gung-ho brother, Jake. The latter is notably different here than in his other Western roles, &#34;Dances with Wolves&#34; (1990) &#34;Wyatt Earp&#34; and &#34;Open Range&#34; (2003). Here he's young & spunky, full of mirth, yet also an expert and deadly gunslinger.<br /><br />After the contrivances and goofiness of the first act, &#34;Silverado&#34; finds its footing and I was absorbed & even thrilled by the story up until around the 70-75-minute mark.  Unfortunately, from there the story gets convoluted, although it ends with a long, rousing gunfight in the town. It’s just that there are so many characters that you tend to lose track and it seems like some expositional scenes were left on the cutting room floor in order to keep the runtime at just over two hours (133 minutes). The subplots concerning Rosanna Arquette, Jeff Goldblum and Linda Hunt are good examples. However, the positive thing about a story like this is that it's not superficial; hence, the movie’s worthy of repeat viewings since you're not likely gonna digest it all in just one or two viewings. A intricate story like this needs at least 2.5 hours of runtime in order to breath and be effective. It demands the length of “Dances with Wolves” and so I’d be interested in seeing a Director’s Cut.<br /><br />Speaking of subplots, I enjoyed certain ones like Kline's love for the midget saloon bartender (Linda Hunt), love in a son/mother sense, that is, but their relationship isn’t developed enough. You have to read in between the lines. I also appreciated the love and loyalty of the four protagonists; the fact that Glover is a black man is of noissue. Love in its purest sense is spiritual in nature and transcends blood, skin color or raw lust. You never know who you'll meet in life and form a strong love-bond with. It's amazing.<br /><br />So why not a higher rating? I didn't find the story all that captivating like, say, Kasdan's &#34;Grand Canyon&#34; (1991). I’m talking about the last hour where I had to struggle a bit to keep attentive, not to mention keep track of all the characters and what’s going on. Then there's the nonsensical editing, obvious missing scenes and a few idiotic implausibilities. Beyond these negatives, &#34;Silverado&#34; has most everything you'd ever want in a Western: gunfights, quick-draw showdowns, smoke-filled saloons, saloon girls, homesteaders, wagon trains, outlaws, posses, jailbreaks, stampedes, box canyons, glorious Western locations, and more. Actually, it verges on overkill. About the only thing it doesn’t have are Native Americans and an uncomplicated story. The latter explains why you DON’T see “Silverado” cited on many Best Westerns lists.<br /><br />The film was shot entirely in New Mexico.<br /><br />GRADE: C+itual in nature and transcends blood, skin color or raw lust.

B0010ZR160|3.0|I thought this was a pretty good movie but no where near as good as some of the reviews I had heard. It was one of those movies that makes you think one thing is going on but that goes out of its way to make the 'real' story so convoluted and unbelievable that though it fools you it also is unbelievable and ridiculous.<br /><br />Kudos to Ed Harris who is great in everything. Casey Affleck was ok but I don't think he is a great actor. I like Morgan Freeman but he plays the same part in every movie.

While it's been impossible to pigeon-hole them into any one type of sound, I've found myself liking every release since.  'Seventh Tree' continues to demonstrate Will and Alison's artistic creativity, once again reaching beyond the borders of what they can do.    This record does not disappoint--it's lush and beautiful... perhaps a little breezy.  You won't be shaking your booty like you did with Supernature, instead you'll be transported to a world of beautiful imagery.  This might be Goldfrapp's finest endeavor yet.

I went on to give Songs to Fan the Flame of Discontent a chance but to no avail.  That did not capture the magic of this album.  The Shape of Punk to Come and Liberation Frequency are standouts.

You have to listen to it by yourself, uninterrupted for it's full effect.  You don't dance to this, you listen to it.  The music is the key to everything.     Thom's voice is something to behold.  Full of emotion.  Minimal but demanding. His range is phenominal. This is the definative Radiohead album.         This being one of my favorite albums of all time, all tracks are recommended.

0151013047|4.0|I have to confess - I found the hushed stillness of fiction in the aftermath of 9/11 almost as daunting as the very sight of the falling towers. For a time, I was almost expecting some latter-day prophet to show up and proclaim, Adorno-style, that literature after Ground Zero is barbaric as well. It is of great relief, therefore, to see 9/11 being increasingly addressed now beyond the sporadic short story and pitched in longer, more substantial narratives. Novels that take on September 11 trickle in at a steady pace. We have seen, in the past few months, the publication of Helen Schulman's A Day at the Beach and Don De Lillo's exquisite prose in Falling Man. The latest fictional take on the infamous attacks is Mohsin Hamid's The Reluctant Fundamentalist, a short but intense novella that made it to the Man Booker Prize 2007 shortlist.       Hamid's second work (his first novel was Moth Smoke) is a dramatic monologue that discloses the story of Changez, a Pakistani university lecturer who gives an impassioned account of his days as a promising analyst at an eminent New-York based financial audit firm. The setting for his tale is as spartan as his situation at the time of narration: he sits at a popular eating-place in a crowded Lahore bazaar and feeds his story into a wraithlike American listener. `I stared', Changez tells him bluntly, `as one - and then the other - of the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center collapsed. And then I smiled. Yes, despicable as it may sound, my initial reaction was to be remarkably pleased.'      It certainly is a daring statement for a young, ambitious Princeton graduate making a lucrative living in a corporate headquarters that boasts luxury bird's-eye views of Manhattan. But then, his entire account is self-consciously provocative, as he outlines his ambivalent affinity with America. It is the tale of a budding financial adviser hopelessly in love with Erica, an upper-middle class `regal' beauty from New York. Through her constant aura of detachment and eventual descent into psychological disorder, Changez's sweetheart may well hint at that America against whom Changez develops his multiple and contradictory identities. The young employee makes a name as a rigorous analyst, unforgiving in his science, goal-oriented -a corporate recruiter's dream come true. Things take a fateful twist on his business trip to Valparaiso, where Changez becomes aware of himself as a `janissary'. Drawing on the analogy with the young Christian hostages successfully trained as fierce Muslim fighters, he awakens to his situation as a US-trained agent operating for an exploitative US company against the interests of his homeland. This epiphanic trip brings his American career to an end and sees him boarding a plane back to Pakistan. Throughout his tale, Changez brings out many of the nuances that characterize the life of a visa-carrying Pakistani residing in post-9/11 America. `[I]t is hateful to hear another person gloat over one's country's misfortune', he tells his listener. `But surely you cannot be completely innocent of such feelings yourself'. Do you feel no joy at the video clips - so prevalent these days - of American munitions laying waste the structures of your enemies?'      9/11, therefore, provokes the demise of the \\"American\\" Changez, and 9/11, even, heightens his awareness of the other scenario that unfolded while millions around the world were glued to CNN's Breaking News. Pakistan's stand-off with India, back then, was set to escalate into a full-blown nuclear confrontation, and this facet of events becomes the catalyst of Changez's conversion. It was in America's interest, he remarks, to carpet-bomb Afghanistan and then stand back as India flexed its muscles at his homeland. As a consequence, Changez mutates vertiginously, from the gifted US-trained novice learning `to go for the fundamentals' in his analytical duties to a `fundamentalist' campaigner for Pakistan's disengagement from US foreignpolicy. If the `war on terror' becomes `the single most important priority of the human species', he declares, `then the lives of those of us who lived in lands in which such killers also lived had no meaning except as collateral damage.'      It is this sensibility towards the wretched of the earth that informs Changez's narrative, and it is expressed with a self-contradicting zeal that denies his listener any character whatsoever. We never get to learn much about the latter - indeed, Hamid himself suggested in a recent interview that Changez's obscure interlocutor is there to accommodate the reader - he becomes in a sense, a space through which anyone of us could contemplate the story. The narrator often curbs his own talk and barges onto the listener's thoughts, instructing him every now and then to shed off his paranoia, prejudice and xenophobia. It is a technique previously utilized by Orhan Pamuk in order to portray the ambivalent nature of the `fundamentalist' frame of mind.       `No country inflicts death so readily upon the inhabitants of other countries, frightens so many people so far away, as America', writes the Pakistani-born Hamid. But then he adds, through his protagonist, `I was perhaps more forceful on this topic than I intended'. The Reluctant Fundamentalist is effective because in its brevity it pulls off a poignant and yet self-critical indictment of post-9/11 America.  Mohsin Hamid's depiction of a hesitant fundamentalist is itself anything but reluctant - it lays bare an astonishing insight into the complex power-mongering of our age, and is performed with a relish in storytelling that promises more of Hamid, and soon.

B000N4SHOE|4.0|For the most part, Chris Noonan turns out to be ideal director for this engaging 2006 biopic of renowned children's book author Beatrix Potter ([[ASIN:0448435217 The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]) as he has proven to be a master of whimsical touches with 1995's [[ASIN:B0000AK7AB Babe]]. He has the requisite light touch to bring a welcome breeziness and gentle poignancy to what could have otherwise been an unremitting historical slog. At the same time, dealing with the sanctity of a beloved real-life figure rather than the travails of a talking pig, Noonan faces greater challenges in bringing a deeper resonance to Potter's life story. Fortunately, the first-time screenplay by Broadway director Richard Maltby, Jr. contains well-considered dialogue that doesn't get too precious, and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, dusting off her flawless Brit-speak from [[ASIN:B0002W4SWC Bridget Jones's Diary]], gives one of her most textured and likeable performances in the title role.<br /><br />Set in Victorian-era England, the story starts with the begrudging acceptance of Potter's manuscript for Peter Rabbit by the Harold and Fruing Warne, a pair of curmudgeonly brothers running a publishing house. Already assuming it will be a failure, they see her small children's book as a safe means to test the business mettle of their younger brother Norman. What happens instead is the meeting of kindred spirits who fall in love. Her book is an immediate success even though her parents, especially her social climbing mother, disapprove of not only her professional activities but also her budding romance with what they consider a tradesman beneath their standing. The first part of the film shifts back and forth between childhood scenes where you can witness the young Beatrix develop her talent and passion for drawing and storytelling. A personal tragedy occurs later in the film which leads Potter to buy a bucolic farm in England's Lakes District. There she develops a proto-environmentalist's mindset and starts buying the surrounding properties to ensure the land stays pristine as working farms.<br /><br />With her ruddy complexion and modest period garb, Zellweger manages to capture the eccentricity of Potter's character without falling heavily into coy mannerisms. She gets help from Noonan's periodic use of animation to bring Potter's characters to life when she is alone. It's a decidedly Disney-style movie technique, but somehow it works in this context. As the shyly affable Norman, Ewan McGregor cuts a charming figure if not that much of a gravitational force in the story. Luckily, Zellweger and McGregor are more suitably matched here than in their previous coupling in 2003's execrable retro-romance, [[ASIN:B00005JLZW Down with Love]]. Emily Watson has a field day playing Norman's spinsterish, suffragette sister Millie. As Beatrix's parents, Barbara Flynn gets to play her pompous mother with relish, while Bill Paterson provides several touching moments as her quietly supportive father. All the production aspects are first-rate - Martin Childs' period production design, Andrew Dunn's picture-perfect cinematography, Anthony Powell's unobtrusive costumes.<br /><br />The 2007 DVD has several solid extras. Noonan provides an informative, often entertaining commentary track, but I wish Zellweger or others participated to fill in some of the empty audio stretches. Two featurettes are included. The more interesting is the twenty-minute \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Beatrix Potter\\", which takes a closer look at the author, her creative inspirations, her passion for naturalism, and her marketing and merchandising acumen. The other is the expected making-of short, a little long at 23 minutes but it does highlight the production process with plenty of interviews with cast and crew. Rounding out the features are the theatrical trailer and a music video of Katie Melva performing \\"When You Taught Me How to Dance\\", the song Beatrix and Norman sing and dance to at her family's Christmas party.
B0010AN7Z4|4.0|this winner for best picture of 1960 more than deserved the oscar when compared to it's competition for the same year.<br /><br />i always avoided this film because even though i love the classics, there have been very few classic comedies i have enjoyed. until recently i believed that this was pure comedy. it's not, it's comedy-drama. there is a significant difference. actually, in certain aspects, it is more drama. it teaches a lesson in the immorality of man and the corruptness of the corporate world. i wasn't disappointed. it's a worthy addition to my library.<br /><br />i watched this film, considered to be Billy Wilder's masterpiece, for the first time last night. i recommend it.<br /><br />as for the DVD( the newly released special edition ), an excellent transfer and great sound.
B000B8QF00|4.0|The collecton is a good album, in fact I prefer it over \\"Jagged Little Pill.\\"  I will argue though with those who say that Alanis is a great or talented singer, she isn't.  She can't hold a note for any length without it going sour; she can't sing a slow song without sounding shrill; she is terrible on the flute (which she does play on occasion.  I am not the only person who recognizes her limited vocal talent--which is to sing angry and make her point heartfelt.  Lucky for her, her singing style mostly masks her clumsiness.<br /><br />I still recommend this album, however, because Alanis is fresh and original.  Her lyrics are oddly, even uncomfortably candid and yet mesmerizing, (even if she is not a poetic talent).  This woman has a strange take on things and it comes across to the listener and gives them a window into to her weird world.  Her talent is HER...her unpredictable and thoroughly self-centered thoughts...and her ability to capture them so nakedly in music.<br /><br />And I will make another point: I do not believe that any other singer could sing these raw lyrics with the passion and honesty of Alanis.  On anyone else these lyrics would seem a ridiculous joke.  She is unique, not just in having such thoughts, but in boldy turning them into lyrics.
0375424474|5.0|This is a very enjoyable and fantastic book, I could not put it down since it was so good! An eye opener.  Easy to understand descriptons of scientific research that have been conducted up to date on fossils and a lot more of exciting information.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|I had heard so much that was good about this movie, that we went ahead and purchased it to watch together on Valentine's day.  What a shocker! First, there are just too many storylines to keep up with, and then there is the sex... if your idea of a romantic comedy includes sex and sexual innuendo, then this is for you.  I found the scenes with the porn stars to be offensive and unnecessary. The references to sex, and even with a young boy being sexually obsessed with a girl, was just too much for me.      And then there is the language.  Again, if you can get around the F-bomb being dropped every five minutes, then you'll love this movie.  I understand that maybe the British have different standards for use of language then some of us, but this made it just horrible to listen to, much less watch.      I would say we made it about less than an hour into the movie before we turned it off.     I think this could have been done in a way that was much more tasteful.
0316067598|5.0|Other than the thrilling tale that Luttrell provides us in this book, I'm amazed by the philosophical insight this guy provides throughout.  He provides us with throughout this book.  Throughout this book, the Navy SEAL provides us with a history of the landscapes in his tale, a history of people such as the Pushtuns, and some other spot shots on the psychological makeup of those he encounters.  My favorite example occurs after the Navy SEAL has been given opiates for his pain in a Pushtun village.  He states: \\"the drug is the one the Taliban and al Queda feed to suicide bombers before they obliterate themselves and everyone else within range.\\"  He then opines on the power of the drug stating: \\"There's nothing heroic about suicide bombers.  They're mostly just dumb, brainwashed kids, stoned out of their minds.\\"  My astonishment is not meant to patronize, but I've read a lot of these military books, and I haven't run across many that are this insightful.  Lone Survivor is also funny.  I know, I know how is it possible that such a tale be funny?  You have to read it.  I could quote you the lines, but it would take about a paragraph to describe the context of the joke.  Robinson and Luttrell managed to include humor in a manner that lightens the load of some of the incidents described in this book, and in doing so they have added importance to the situation by bringing you in all the more.  That's craftsmanship.  To those who might think the book supplies undue political overtones, I say that you can't bring your own political agenda to such a reading exercise.  Luttrell brings his agenda to the book, and that is of an American who wants America to win wars.  He cites examples of institutions that he thinks impede his progress throughout.  He cites examples of how these institutions affect his thought processes and actions as a Navy SEAL.  The book is told from his perspective.  If you're going to bring too much of your own perspective to this account, you probably shouldn't purchase his book.
0385338724|4.0|Twenty-eight years old Lexi Smart thinks it is still 2004 and that she disgracefully just missed her father's funeral.  However, the working girl struggles with why she is in a London hospital (from a car accident) and worse she learns that it is 2007.  Adding to her confusion of where the last three years went is her physical appearance; she looks great and somehow has become a successful shark businesswoman.<br /><br />Lexi decides to investigate herself in order to learn what happened that changed her from mouse to lioness.  She also tries to kindle warmth between her and her aloof spouse Eric while his associate Jon passionately insists she was dumping her husband for him before she bumped her head in the car accident.<br /><br />Although the theme has been used numerous times, Lexi refreshes Sophie Kinsella's fun tale with her quest to learn what happened to change her as radically as she has forgotten the last three years.  Her inquiries into herself enable the audience to better understand who she is, how she got to where she is, and her relationship with Eric and Jon.  Ms. Kinsella provides a smart contemporary tale.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
0345479092|3.0|Another not-great baby book. She doesn't advocate co-sleeping and she doesn't advocate crying it out (she says these are both \\"extremes\\" and outlines the disadvantages of each - all of which are true) - instead she suggests a \\"sensible middle ground\\" wherein the parent picks up the baby when it cries, makes sure its needs are met, then puts it back down in its crib and pats the tummy until the baby calms itself. Well, I think she is forgetting the emotional needs... I tried this with a baby that just wanted to be held. It equated to several hours of intense on-and-off crying, all the while with me picking her up, checking her diaper (she had already eaten), and putting her back down in the middle of the night - hours of it (I kept a log), with the most horrible crying I had heard from her to date, starting and stopping, then finally going on for 10 minutes, would have been more if I would have let it - when all she wanted was to be held... it was not hunger, diaper, or overexhaustion. When I picked her up and held and rocked her (something the author recommends NOT to do!) she calmed and went to sleep. I was only able to grab the 4 hours of sleep I finally did get that night by putting the baby in a swing (the author is adamantly against swings! Swing in this situation: crutch that prevented my newborn from learning independence, or tool that helped me calm her and get the 4 hours of sleep I did get?) So I found it impossible to implement this book's advice on sleep management. There is no middle ground between these two \\"extremes\\" of parenting styles. It is one or the other. You meet the baby's needs at the expense of your sleep, or you meet your needs perhaps at the expense of the baby's emotional well-being. There is NO compromise (not at 5 weeks old anyway). I guess I am choosing to meet her needs and sacrifice my sleep because that is what I feel is right for us. I'm sure that this will get old and I'll be in trouble again looking for advice... just not from this book. Perhaps it is simply too early to teach independence to a newborn, as Hogg advocates.    The rest of the book is entertaining to read, but doesn't have a ton of useful advice, mostly because she really advocates treating your baby like an adult to a fault (e.g., \\"it's very important to start your newborn off with a nice tour of your house\\", and \\"ask permission before starting your baby massage\\" - I didn't find these to be useful pieces of advice)     All in all I think the author is secretly an advocate of CIO even for newborns but didn't want to sound heartless so presents a purportedly middle of the road approach that is pure fiction when the rubber meets the road and your baby has all her physical needs met but is crying for YOU. Picking up, putting down, and patting - it does not work and equates to CIO. Yes, you need to sleep, and if you meet your baby's emotional need for you fully, then you won't sleep, but I think that is just what being a parent of a newborn is about. I probably wouldn't sell as many books if I wrote that there is no magic solution or secret - parents have to either ferberize their baby or else meet their emotional needs and just patiently suck it up on the sleep deprivation thing.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Despite critical acclaim, many fans of the show are rather harsh in appraising the film, for two reasons - one, the singing and two, the deletion of about half the score.  I am in neither camp, although either of these factors might previously have caused me to pronounce most film adaptations of almost any Broadway musical a failure.  Instead, I am thrilled with this production far beyond expectations.<br /><br />This may not have been, if I had not had so much respect for Stephen Sondheim.  During pre-release publicity, he granted an unusual (for him) number of interviews, stating he is unequivocally satisfied with Tim Burton's vision.  As anyone who appreciates his high level of artistic integrity knows, Mr. Sondheim would not give praise to this project if he were not satisfied.  Stephen Sondheim is considered by many to be the greatest composer in the American theatre, and I have followed him long enough to know that he would not declare his endorsement if he were not truly happy with the finished film.<br /><br />I have listened carefully to Mr. Sondheim in those recent interviews, and finally understand why so many film versions of stage musicals haven't worked.  Time passes very differently in live theatre than it does on film; musical numbers, which pass rather quickly on stage, are apt to seem like a small eternity on screen.  Therefore, the very thing that attracts live theatre audiences is apt to make many movie audiences run screaming from the auditorium.  And there is also the problem of what Alfred Hitchcock once termed \\"suspension of disbelief\\"; in real life, no one ever bursts into song during one of life's dramatic moments, no less accompanied by a full orchestra.  For some reason, moviegoers who have no problem with giant gorillas or men from Mars find singing on celluloid hard to take.  Thanks to some of the theories recently voiced by Mr. Sondheim, I finally understand why so many previous attempts to film Broadway musicals fail.  In short, the theatre and film are two entirely different mediums, with two entirely different audiences.  Although many theatre lovers would be happy to see almost any stage musical transferred to film exactly as done on stage, movie audiences demand something different.  And something different is what they get with Sweeney Todd.<br /><br />And then there is the score.  Tim Burton has said that he is a long-time fan of the stage production of Sweeney Todd.  As disappointing as it is for many fans to accept how much of the score has been cut, it was probably harder for Mr. Burton to decide what to remove.  The original show ran over three hours; 75% of the story was sung, making Sweeney Todd one of the few genuine operas to emerge from Broadway.  The film is less than two hours, and judging by the \\"complete\\" soundtrack CD, easily 40% of the score has been removed, chiefly the ensemble pieces.  Mr. Burton apparently judged (probably correctly) that the witty choral numbers, which worked so well on stage, would be clunky and ponderous on film, and he made the prudent but (I'm sure) difficult decision to let them go.  This is the sorest point for many fans of the show, and had I not been paying careful attention to Mr. Sondheim's recent statements, I may not have been able to get past that point myself.<br /><br />What has been excised is compensated for in Mr. Burton's sumptuous visuals and fastidious detail.  While Mr. Sondheim's changes to the lyrics have resolved previously problematic portions of the score and actually improved it, it's amazing how much of what is left is faithful to the original.  Though a tragedy, the story is basically a dark comedy, and many of Mr. Burton's finer touches, especially the staging of the musical numbers, have enhanced the story to the point where I have hardly missed the deletions, and I speak as someone who has loved this piece in almost all of its previous renderings.<br /><br />Although never a particular favorite of mine, I admit Johnny Depp is a revelation.  Without detracting from previous interpreters (especially Len Cariou and George Hearn), Mr. Depp's portrayal of Barker / Todd is fully fleshed out, and I was able to immediately excuse the fact that he is not a seasoned vocalist.  This is not Broadway, and there is no need for his voice to reach the back of the house.  If anything, the vocal limits of the lead characters actually enhance the realistic feel of the film.  It is also a pleasure to have Toby, Anthony and Joanna played by actors of the appropriate age, and to hear accents that actually invoke pre-Victorian London.<br /><br />To me, the real star is the score, although many moviegoers complain about lack of \\"memorable songs\\".  I believe good music should be subtle; the absence of \\"catchy tunes\\" is only indicative to me of the high quality of the music.  Those previously unfamiliar with Sweeney Todd are urged to acquire the complete soundtrack (with the libretto included) and follow along with the words as the songs are sung.  The first thing you will realize is (as with any of Mr. Sondheim's works) how incredibly witty and sophisticated the lyrics are; on first listen you may miss most of his delicious wit.  His use of the language, his clever rhymes, and his intelligent, deft semantics will amaze anyone who takes the time to listen.  There are reasons why so many consider Sondheim the foremost composer of the theatre, and so many intelligent theatergoers hang on his every word.  But just as important as his words (and I have always admired Sondheim's ability to use words above all else that I treasure in the world of musical theatre), you will find, especially if you listen long and hard enough, that his delicate, subtle music will, in time, work its way into your heart and conscience as some of the most beautiful music ever composed.  This is NOT top-forty pop music, the type that is so often mistaken for excellence these days.  Sondheim writes genuine, heartfelt gorgeous melodies; that is, real music.  Open your heart and mind to Sondheim's glorious words and sumptuous airs, and don't be surprised if you become a fan for life..

I'd forgotten how bittersweet the ending was though.  A real trip to the wayback machine!!!
0385338724|4.0|Lexi wakes up in hospital after a car accident. She's lost all memory of the last three years and is amazed at how her life has changed: suddenly she's married to a gorgeous guy, she's running her department at work and on paper her life suddenly seems perfect. But slowly she starts to realize that things are not quite as wonderful as they initially appeared to be. For starters, her best friends seem to have distanced themselves from her.  And her husband Eric doesn't really seem to be her type.<br /><br />This is a fast and fun book to read. The premise hooks you in and some parts are laugh out loud funny (particularly when Lexi realizes why her husband keeps making the Mt Blanc references).  Okay, so it doesn't stretch your brain too much and you need to suspend your disbelief that she would have made some of the changes in her life, but overall it's still very entertaining. A perfect holiday read.<br /><br />This is the third Sophie Kinsella book that I've read, and while I enjoyed it, I don't think it's as good as her others. If you like her books you'll enjoy this too, but if you're new to her as an author I think her others are better.
B000VI70X6|5.0|Great concert,the extras were very good esp. the one about all the work that she does with the children of Columbia.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Very imaginative scifi show. Exciting, fast pace, well acted and written. Keeping the world/England safe from aliens is the primary mission of Torchwood, a secret agency that seems to have always existed. A bit too much alternative sexual life style material for a scifi show which is unnecessary IMO. The story sells itself without the sex.
B000AYELVU|5.0|While there's still a good bit of Wolverine in this second entry into the franchise, X-2, as I had hoped it would, also gives the chance for other members of the team to shine.  We join them as Wolverine returns to Prof. Xavier's school after a fruitless journey to Alkali Lake in Alaska, where he believed he might find clues to how he became what he is.  Meanwhile, anti-mutant hysteria is mounting in Washington, fed by the sinister Southerner William Stryker, who has a secret agenda.  In pursuit of it, he interrogates the imprisoned Magneto under drugs and learns of Prof. Xavier's supercomputer, Cerebro, with which the Professor can literally find any human mind in the world--or even billions of them at a time.  Stryker captures Xavier and Cyclops while they are visiting Magneto's prison and sends a Special Forces detachment to invade the school, knowing that Storm and Jean Gray are away.  The only thing that saves most of the students from capture is Wolvie, who proves to be a ferocious fighter in their defense and delays the military long enough for the bulk of them to escape through a series of secret tunnels.  Meanwhile, Magneto's cohort Mystique arranges his escape from prison, and he seeks out Xavier's pupils, knowing that in order to save mutantkind from extermination they must find and rescue the Professor.    I was delighted to see in this film the introduction of one of my favorite X-ers, Kurt Wagner/The Incredible Nightcrawler, a demonic-looking teleport (and devout Catholic).  There's also a brief view of someone whom I suspect is Colossus, the young Russian who can transform his body into steel.  The effects, of course, are fantastic, and the scenes in the beleaguered school and in Stryker's secret base under Alkali Lake (where Wolverine finally learns the truth about himself--or at least part of it) are non-stop thrill-a-minute action told with wonderful pace and careful attention to necessary exposition.  Magneto displays once again the flashes of decency that make him one of the most intriguing of Marvel villains.  And, of course, Xavier and his team are splendid.  This film has convinced me that I definitely want the X-Men to have shelf space in my DVD collection, and I'll be adding both it and its predecessor as soon as I can.
038073186X|5.0|I'm a big Lehane fan and I've read all of his books.  This one is quite different in that it deals with mental illness in the truest sense, that contained within an insane asylum.  From start to finish this book will keep you guessing, and it is incredibly unpredictable.  Right when you think you've figured out the plot, you find you weren't even close!  It's a great book and Lehane is still among my top favorite mystery thriller authors....his characters are always extremely believable and the twists and turns of this story will keep you reading until the wee hours.

0553579908|4.0|This is the second book in the wickedly-entertaining \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" series from George R. R. Martin.  The story picks up from where \\"A Game of Thrones\\" left off.  Chaos and violence reign following the deaths of King Robert Baratheon and his \\"Hand\\", Lord Eddard Stark.  The land of Westeros is torn apart.  Four men are fighting for control of the Iron Throne.  King Rob Stark is after the men responsible for the murder of his father, Lord Eddard Stark.  The Queen's illegitimate son, a cruel boy of thirteen, now sits on the Iron Throne.  And the former king's two brothers, Renly Baratheon and Stannis Baratheon both want the Iron Throne.  Meanwhile, across the sea, Princess Daenerys Stormborn, the last of the great Targaryen family, have just managed to bring three fossilized dragon eggs back to life.<br /><br />Against this backdrop of large-scale battles, the main players introduced in the previous book continue to live out their lives and to try to find their place in this tumultuous period in the history of Westeros.  We find the bastard, Jon Snow, slowly moving up among the Night Watch hierarchy.  Assigned as a squire to the Lord Commander of the Night Watch, Jon goes off beyond the Wall to face and fight the dangerous Wildlings.  His ever-present direwolf, Ghost, and his trusty sidekick, the craven Samwell Tarly are both with him.  The overly-ambitious Theon Greyjoy has put together a plan that could make him another contender for the kingship of Westeros.  Meanwhile, the Westerosi Houses, both great and small, continue to tirelessly plot and scheme in order to place themselves closer to the center of power.<br /><br />But enough of the story.  I, Citan, your humble friend and reviewer, would not want to spoil it for you.  Suffice it to say that this second book in the series is even better than the first one.  The pace is faster, and there are less \\"fillings\\", so to speak.  Every chapter, once again, is a POV from a specific character's perspective.  Sort of like playing a First-Person-Shooter video game.  You never get the complete picture, because you don't have a third-person narrator.  What you get is the character's POV.  You \\"see\\" only what the character sees.  But Martin does a good job of putting together the POVs so that, after reading a few, you get a more complete picture of events.  This is not a novel for the casual reader who likes to skip chapters and speed-read pages.  Indeed, you will have to pay attention and put the POVs (points-of-view) together to understand the story and decipher the plot.<br /><br />Let me say once again that this is a fantasy series for mature audiences.  Incest, betrayal, sorcery, and violence are ever-present within the pages of the novel.  However, those same qualities probably give the series more realism than your typical fantasy fare.  I highly recommend the series to anyone who likes fantasy.ng a First-Person-Shooter video game.  You never get the complete picture, because you don't have a third-person narrator.

0312330537|5.0|I read about 3 books a week and listen to at least one CD book a week as I drive.  This is, by far, the most engaging and breathtaking listened-to read I have had to date!  I am not finished yet with the 900 plus pages of listening, and am mesmerized by the depth of character development.  I am thrilled that this is a book I am hearing, rather than reading,  as the full color of the words, the flow of the intertwined stories within the story is richer and more alive with the listening.     The beauty and passion and love of India so richly flows from the story of Shantaram. I really would love to visit Bombay - with Mr. Roberts as my guide - what an amazing journey that would be!
B0011NVC9I|4.0|First off I have to say I really enjoyed this movie even tho I have not read the poem that it was based on. I have heard alot of people complaining they hated this movie because they left out or totally changed certain parts of the story. But you got to remember the book or poem in this case is always better than the movie version of it.      So what I have to say is if you read the poem before seeing the movie try and look at this movie as a story that here to entertain you and not a movie based on the poem. You might actually like it better if you are not comparing it to the poem. So with that said give it a chance and rent it

B0000A1HQP|5.0|Buy, rent, or watch this movie.  It's freakin\\" hilarious. I'd never heard of it before, but now it belongs on the top shelf with of the rest of the classics. BTW, it doesn't hurt to speak french, but the movie's just as entertaining with subtitles.  Two thumbs up!  Randolph
0634060384|5.0|My jazz professor at school recommended this book and I found Amazon's price to be unbeatable.  Since this book was published by Hal Leonard, it has become more widely available and affordable to all musicians.  Any jazz musician should invest in this book.  I am just beginning to study jazz piano and \\"The Real Book\\" has been an invaluable resource.  The spiral binding is strong and the pages stay open without difficulty.  All songs are one page so there is no need for page turns.  The music is scripted in Jazz manuscript.  There are plenty of songs to please a variety of tastes.      The only complaint I have heard from other musicians is that this book contains more Broadway tunes than older editions and omits some of the jazz classics that were found in older editions.  However, I do not own a previous edition, and am finding this edition to be an excellent addition to my repertoire.  This book is worth the investment for all levels of jazz musicians. There is not another book like this on the market.
B0000B1648|5.0|It was finding Face To Face in the bargain rack at Woolworth's in 1969 that started it for me.  Sure, I'd heard and loved the early singles...even had a few of them.  But what to make of this LP?  I never expected to find it, and I certainly didn't know anything about it.  Lola was still to come, and the Kinks hadn't had a hit stateside in over 3 years.  But, hey, at $1.99, I really didn't have much to lose.  My instincts told me that I'd made quite a find, but the proof was when I took it home and put it on my new Coronado stereo (ceramic cartridge and all, remember those?).  I knew from the first (\\"Hello...who is that speaking please?\\") notes of Party Line that I'd indeed found the bargain of my (then) short life.  It never let up; one jem after another.  I particularly loved Rainy Day In June and Holiday In Waikiki.  I was an instant convert.  So began the hunt for \\"the rest of the story\\", but it wasn't easy.  Even a trip to Kansas City didn't uncover new Kinks LPs.  But over a year later, lo and behold, digging through an 8-track bargain bin, I hit the jackpot.  There were both Arthur and Lola vs. Powerman and the Apes, and again that price of $1.99.  I remember turning all my friends on to the Kinks.      I liked Arthur and Lola vs.... even better than Face To Face, largely because they sounded so much better (don't forget that ceramic cartridge), and they rocked a lot harder.  1966 was feeling pretty quaint in 1971.  I thought, in terms of \\"high concept\\", that Arthur made Tommy look pathetic.  Ray's observations were so poignant, and the songs hung together so well.  I thought then and still think today that it was a work of genius.  Ray was a bit of a cynical curmudgeon when he was the tender age of 25, and I liked it.    However you choose to enjoy this album, it works.  It is a literary marvel, but it also rocks and has great melodies and band arrangements.  John Dalton and John Gosling really added a lot.      A definite dessert island disc for me.

B000QUCNOK|1.0|that in this day and age that when someone in hollywood hears of a novel deemed 'unfilmable'  that the sound of a cashbox would deafen to a whisper the truly telling phrase \\" and there's a good reason\\"...<br />\\"Lord of the Rings\\"???? YES! I DO  BELIEVE there is documentation SOMEWHERE than upon the published release of THAT famed trilogy,, artists of every visual medium concieveable began lining up!<br />Now,,, THIS MESS,,  well,,,a Tolkien/Jackson collaboration it IS NOT!!<br /> The works of such  other true masters as Charles Dickens and  E.A. Poe,, true,, WERE read aloud to paying audiences, BY THE  AUTHORS THEMSELVES, 'on tours' to promote sales  just like today,, only WITHOUT 'FLASHCARDS' OR OTHER VISUAL AIDES!' Again, there was a reason.<br /> To ANYONE of my distinguished? collegues here who found this film 'funny' in any way,,, well,,,you should do a gut-buster weekend of 'Saw I-III',, while eating pasta perhaps, then seek counseling first thing next morning.

B000AP04OM|5.0|Very prompt service - within days of order.  Excellent sound rendition and gorgeous scenes and photography for a 40 year old production.  For those of us who had seen it 40 years ago, nothing new but just as thrilling. Sound quality outstanding. The anniversary edition also included trailers, special features, interviews on a second disk which brought production tidbits and information that was fascinating as well. Quite a complement to our library of favorites.

630460291X|3.0|PLEASE NOTE: My review is for the Kevin Costner version of Robin Hood. For some reason, Amazon is currently grouping all the reviews from *both* the Costner and Bergin version of Robin Hoods.    Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves had a lot of potential. It had going for it a stellar cast including Morgan Freeman, Christian Slater & Alan Rickman. It had an epic storyline, handed down generation after generation, about one of the all-time classic heroes. It had a big production budget, and a memorable score. And yet... all that it managed was a decent action film.    Perhaps the biggest problem is Kevin Costner. His Robin Hood not only doesn't have an English accent (which is something easily forgiven), but also has a wooden, monotone personality (which is not). The others of Sherwood seem to find Robin inspiring, but I find him very dull -- he can't even muster real passion for Marian. Costner has a long history of derailing movies, and he almost ruins this one, too.    Another problem that this movie suffers from is a needlessly bloated cast. For some reason, the makers of the film weren't content with the Robin Hood legend, as-is. They thought that it needed more characters. And so, they invent a witch, and a young boy, and an blind servant, and a snarky moor, etc. Some of these characters wind up becoming more central than even Robin Hood staples, like Little John and Friar Tuck (wonderfully played by Who's Line Is It Anyway regular, Mike McShane). It makes a person wonder why. Why did we need to make up these new characters, when all it really served to do was to take away from the others? No one, other than Costner and Rickman as the villain, winds up getting a lot of screentime.    This movie would be a lot worse than it is, if anyone other than Alan Rickman had played the Sheriff of Nottingham (who also assumes Prince John's usual role of usuper). Rickman is superb in just about everything he does, and he is perfectly cast here. \\"At least I didn't use a spoon,\\" isa line my friends and I still quote to each other, all these years later. Alan Rickman is the one true spark in this otherwise tepid film.    Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves had a lot of potential. Ultimately, it turned out an action flick that was fun enough to watch on the big screen, but doesn't really hold up in the living room, years later. It suffers from a pointlessly changed storyline, bloated cast, and a stone-faced, one-tone delivery from Kevin Costner. It is relieved by some of the strong performers in its cast, most notably Alan Rickman, who is a perfect Nottingham/John villain.    Three stars.

0525950079|3.0|...but fell short.  The characterization is flat, and the drama doesn't jump off the page.  I am a fan of Mr. Follett, but WORLD WITHOUT END was published before it was quite ready.      It does have some striking good points.  The backdrop is wonderful.  Medieval England in the mid 1300s.  The 100 Year War with France had begun, the Black Plague was on the horizon.  The Church reigned supreme, even monarchs could not challenge the clerics' supremacy.  Upon this stage emerge four children, the brothers Merthin and Ralph, and their new found friends Caris and Gwenda.    The four children witness a battle in the forest where Sir Thomas, with the help of Ralph, fights off two of the king's soldiers.  Thomas is wounded and the children, except for Merthin, escape.  Thomas is pursued because of a deadly secret he carries, and Merthin helps him bury his secret in the forest.    The secret plays around the edges of the story, but is never central to the plot.  The story follows the lives, loves, triumphs, and failures of the four children as their lives wend their way through Kingsbridge.  The overall drama is lost in the tapestry, which is finely woven with historically accurate portrayals of daily living in the fictional village.    A couple of plot points have already been employed by others, and this diluted the drama.  I also found a couple of errors, minor to be sure, but they also detracted from the overall enjoyment.    If you loved PILLARS OF THE EARTH as I did, you will find WORLD WITHOUT END a bit disappointing.  If you are looking for a finely woven, historically accurate portrayal of life in England during the 1300s, by all means get yourself a copy of WORLD WITHOUT END and dig in.
B0012QE4OO|3.0|Nerdy high schooler David Rice (Thieriot) really likes Millie (Robb).  One day, when trying to give her a gift, the local bully intervenes and tosses the gift into a frozen river.  When attempting to recover the gift, David falls through and is trapped.  At least, he is until he teleports into the middle of the Ann Arbor library.  Everyone believes him to be dead, and he sees it as a chance to start over.  He hones his skills as well.  To get some money, he robs a bank, and that is when NSA agent Roland (Jackson) notices him.  Roland doesn't like \\"jumpers.\\"  As an adult, David (Christensen) lives a good life.  He returns home to see Millie (Bilson), and she notices that something is different about him.  He also finds out he is not alone.  There are other \\"jumpers\\" that are being hunted by \\"paladins\\" whose only desire is to kill them.  When Roland finds David, David is in for the fight of his life, because Roland is out for blood.<br /><br />\\"Jumper\\" is an interesting idea that is poorly executed.  Christensen has proven himself to be a wooden actor, and this is no exception.  He is a poor choice for David.  The action and the effects are top notch.  The origin story is well told, and I'm not a fan of origin stories.  The powers and the war between jumpers and paladins is left vague enough to make you want more.  The biggest problem with the movie (aside from Christensen's acting) is the fact that the movie doesn't end so much as it just stops.  The last five minutes leave a nasty taste in your mouth as David confronts one of the bad guys and is given a head start.  He decides to take a leisurely direction even though he is still the hunted.  Clearly, \\"Jumper\\" is set up for a sequel, but when that sequel is not a given, a movie needs to provide some closure.  This is one to wait for on DVD.
1582701709|1.0|I bought the book. Then I bought the movie, and bought my husband the audio book.  I am very sorry I did!  Positive thinking is one thing but to have Rhonda tell people they can heal themselves, to tell people they do not need medication and to tell people that all bad in their lives is brought upon them by their own thinking is morally wrong.  This was not in the movie and I don't recall it in the hard copy either. But in the audio, a whole different story. I'd not have purchased it had I known.     I wrote Rhonda and doubt I will hear back.  We have always been positive thinkers.  I felt this was along those lines.  We have experienced some very hard times due to her pontification, based on her medical observations/suggestions.   She is NOT a doctor and to give out recommendations like one can do serious damage.    I would like her to put a medical disclaimer in the book. I've always felt that positive thinking is very good.  But behind thoughts must be action.  I'd like to have seen that stated loud and clear and a whole lot less of, heal thyself, lose the glasses and think yourself thin.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|This album has to be the most distinctive of the King Crimson collection.  It is an interesting dicotomy of accessible music and heaviness that makes this one an undeniable classic in the prog rock genre.  The trio of Robert Fripp, Bill Bruford, and John Wetton have produced something strongly unique, agressive, yet poignant at times.  The album starts off with Red, the most instantly recognizable KC tune, which still produces chills after many listenings.  Fallen Angel is a beautiful mix of subtlety and the heavy hammer.  One More Red Nightmare carries on with the a strong beat.  Providence is simply fantastic, the interplay between David Cross' violin and John Wetton's heavy bass playing is signature Crimso, particulary for this group, and one of the reasons I hold this iteration of KC in such high regard.  The album ends with the fantastic Starless.      As I understand it, the band was in a state of chaos at the production of this album, afterwhich they broke up.  Is that tension evident in the album?  If it is, it's channelled in such a way as to have produced something truly phenomenal.  I'd highly recommend this album to all, it's a good entry point into the King Crimson catalogue.  5 stars!
B0011FXLCC|3.0|Slow and low, that is the tempo, or at least the majority of the new album from Goldfrapp. Seventh Tree, the bands 4th long player, marks a drastic change in direction and sound, but one that's not completely foreign territory. Gone are the beats and electro glam elements of Black Cherry and Supernature, anything else remotely electronic has been replaced with acoustic guitars and strings. From the instant you push play, some may find similarities to the band's debut, Felt Mountain, and why that may be true in a few places, Seventh Tree is also its own animal. The songs on it are somehow less haunting, but more folk inspired. Less eerie, but much warmer in tone. For the most part, the disc feels a little too lazy, like a nice relaxing summer afternoon.    I understand the reason for the change, bands shift directions all the time, after all, how many Verizon commercials can you soundtrack? Maybe Alison was just tired of all the synthesizers and dancing? Admittedly, it took me a while to get over the fact this didn't sound like Black Cherry and Supernature, but it took me longer to figure out it wasn't as close to Felt Mountain as I first thought. It shares the same beautiful qualities of Felt Mountain, and the same personal, simplistic songs, but something is missing. I just think in the process of recording it, the mystery was lost. The appeal of Felt Mountain (and some of Black Cherry) is that it has a curious, haunting aspect to it. Seventh Tree is so stripped down in places, it fails to provoke emotion when it should be all about that. Where all of the previous work had a dynamic to the records as a whole, the simple songs on Seventh Tree pull that dynamic out and pushes the focus on a chilled-out acoustic record. An ok idea on paper I guess, but with so many elements that I loved now stripped away completely, it is a hard pill to swallow, even in it's sweetest form.    When they do decide to pick up the pace on songs like Caravan Girl, it seems way out of placeand too little, too late. Even though some of it strangely reminds me of some late seventies records, it still is Goldfrapp, and there is no mistaking that. Clowns is wonderful and atmospheric and works wonders as a great opener. Clowns is one song that would have been right at home on Felt Mountain or Black Cherry. The pleasantly sunny lead single, A&E plays it a bit too safe, but does just enough to keep me from hitting fast forward. The one true and constant throughout is Alison's voice, it is still as gorgeous as ever. It shines on songs like Some People and Little Bird, and with the lack of beats and samples getting in the way, it definitely plays up the band's strongest suit. The problem is when you pull things out, you got to make sure there are things left. Apart from that amazing voice, we just don't have very much to go on. Worse yet, some of the songs aren't very melodic, even though their delivery would suggest otherwise.    Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad record, just one that catches our expectations off-guard big time, then fails to really wow us when it should. It is a very pleasant album and why that's not a bad thing, I have just come to expect more from them than just chilling out. No doubt Seventh Tree will grow on me as it ages, it already has, but I doubt I'll reach for it as much as those records that came before it. So while we've seen big musical changes from Goldfrapp before, Seventh Tree fails to spark all the same emotions and excitement, even though its heart is in the right place.
B00005JPNY|3.0|Please please please read the book.  There is so much more to it than could ever be included in a film.    I feel sure there will be a directors cut.
B000002UAO|5.0|The Beatles' songs revolve around little moments in life. The lyrics are simple and the music catchy and well-tuned to the message being conveyed by the lyrics. All the songs in this album were an instant hit with me and my wife.
0634023020|5.0|Most rewarding transcription book that I have bought in quite some time. Coming from a hard rock / blues background, I've been trying to learn some Jazz tunes using chord melody. I often find myself learning the head of a song and then end up dropping it because the piece gets too noodley, loosing the melody of the song.<br />Not these transcriptions though, each one is worthy of completing to end.<br />Again, as someone else wrote, the included CD is great just to sit back and listen to, should be sold by itself, too many non-musicians are missing out.
B0004Z33EG|5.0|In 1982 Sylvester Stallone releases yet another fantastic movie with \\"First Blood\\",the first in the Rambo series.\\"First Blood\\" was inspired by David Morrell's epic novel of the same name.While it doesn't take entirely what is in the book and that many parts if not nearly each of them were written by Stallone himself.It is to notice that Stallone gave Rambo a more human perspective of the character than Morrell did.There have been three sequels that followed but whom all failed to reach the level of the first : \\"First Blood Part 2\\"(1985),\\"Rambo III\\"(1988) and the more recent \\"Rambo\\" in 2008.Decades latter and First Blood is still an amazing movie providing you both action and thrills.Stallone managed to bring two memorable franchises,Rocky And Rambo wich became some of America's most beloved movies.<br /><br />In First Blood Stallone plays the role of John Rambo a Green Beret vet who went to Vietnam and was trained to kill.Rambo searches for the last of his comrades from the Green Berets days,and finds out he died from cancer a few years ago.He walks to a nearby town and is trown out of the town by Sheriff William Teasle.Rambo comes back and is \\"roughed up\\" by the cops who without knowing they had made a new powerfull ennnemy.John escapes and the police chases him.He then shows us how much of a killing machine he is by setting up traps and killing.That's when Colonel Samuel Trautman(who was initialy going to be played by Kirk Douglas and at the last minute it all changed)comes in.He claims to be the only one who can stop Rambo as he trained him and obeyed him.It turns out to be a terrific action movie full of suspense and at the same time full of drama and intense moments.Let me tell you if you enjoy movies with any of the mentionned above you are likely to love this movie.<br /><br />The special features.It is known already that the movie itself is incredible as well as a must see classic.The features from previous releases are gone for the most part,and the commentaries by the \\"First Blood\\" novel creator David Morrell are not included anymore wich is a shame considering he talked about many things and gave lots of helpfull information.The alternate endings are still there including the ending when Rambo killed himself which was the original ending of the movie before it was changed because of bad reactions to the ending.There are many possibilities for audio and visual with the metascopes and others that let you wtahc the film in different ways.I wonder why they cutted the extras,they did the same for the Rocky remasters.My advice : if you have the older versions don't get these you won't get anything new.its not worth it.If you cans score one of these \\"Special Editions\\" then you might consider yourself to have gotten a great deal.Those \\"Ultimate Editions\\" aren't so ultimate after all.<br /><br />\\"First Blood\\" stands as a classic and a must have.It does not suit everyone be advised so have to know a minimum on the movie before you actually rent and/or buy it.As mentionned above those editions aren't the best and the older editions are much better.Yet this one is easier to find and ainvailable nearly everywhere DVDs are sold which is pretty much the only advantage with these Ultimate editions.You can also save a lot by buying the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" boxed set of

B000002KD9|5.0|After the Gold Rush is one of Neil's finest lp's. A must for any Young fan.
1932907009|5.0|The reason I bought this book was the amount of positive feedback that readers had posted. Upon actually reading it, all those reviews proved true! I can tell you this book was a breakthrough in my work flow. As a largely self-taught screenwriter (my background is producing), I found the practical applications invaluable. I've read other screenwriting books but there was always something lacking in the actual application of theory. It's tough to write your first feature without having tools that break down such a daunting task into manageable pieces. Especially useful was \\"the board\\", it provided me with a visual representation of my story's plot. My work flow has forever changed and thanks to STC.   I highly recommend Save the Cat as a fun and informative book that's a breeze to read (I finished it the first day)!
B00104QSOM|2.0|This film had some excellent dramatic elements and thrilling cinematography. The actors did a professional job and the characters were interestingly and even compellingly drawn. The film promised a lot and that made it so disappointing when it did not deliver.  The story begins well. I kept waiting for it to open into something magnificent, surprising and creative. Instead it lost energy and momentum and became sort of meaningless. I finally lost patience and was in the process of walking out of it when it ended.
B00005JCAA|5.0|This is an awesome take on how death and life can change in a blink of an eye and it keeps you guessing what will happen next.
B00104QSOM|5.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />This movie solidifies Daniel Day-Lewis as the breakout actor of this decade. Always selective in his roles, he does the character of Daniel Plainview with such brilliant intensity, humor, love, hate, and subtlety that you never realize his character is changing as the movie progresses.<br /><br />The story is not at all highly dramatic and complex, following the simple story of Plainview's attempt to get at the vast ocean of oil beneath a small western village. The movie is primarily a character study, as Daniel takes up perhaps 90% of the movie.<br /><br />Paul Dano, as Eli Sunday, plays opposite Daniel not too often, but in such a social duel with one another that doesn't overwhelm or underwhelm. And you begin to notice throughout the movie that Eli becomes more and more like Daniel as the story progresses.<br /><br />The movie's focus on Daniel is done in such a way that the movie is about him, but not in a megalomaniacal way that he must be on screen at all times. Other characters shine around him, and play off of him to make their own characters that much more interesting.<br /><br />The music is highly unique, and definitely would break the movie if it were any different, or non-present at all.  It almost works like a silent movie if it were just the music and subtitles.  It could even work as a musical without singing.<br /><br />But the highest marks the movie gets, the most brilliant part of the film, the most frightening element of it, and the meaning behind my vaguely grotesque review title, is the fact that the character of Daniel Plainview is written and portrayed with such affection, reality, and depth, that he is very nearly a real person.  He could seem to be more real than many living people today.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis knows and perfectly executes every emotion the character would experience, in such a way that even when he goes overboard, it's utterly believable that such a character would say such a thing, or do such a thing.  There are no gaps in personality or lapses in logic.  From the beginning, you are frightened by how utterly real a person he is, and how utterly good-natured, kind-hearted, and human he is!  Even as he sets about his work, his primary concerns are less with making money and more with making sure his workers are provided for, the town (Little Boston) provided for, and everyone working happily at full capacity.<br /><br />Even as he slowly becomes insane, he retains aspects of humanity, as he sobs mournfully for his lost brother after learning the truth and killing the imposter Henry Plainview.  He even sobs, and drinks himself to sleep after confronting his son (at the end, when he's grown up), revealing he was an orphan he took care of after his father died, and severing all ties to him.  He does all he can for HW after the boy loses his hearing, and keeps careful tabs on him when he's sent away to a school for the deaf, constantly questioning Fletcher Hamilton about his accomodations.<br /><br />The nomination and subsequent winning of Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis, after watching this performance, is absolutely no contest.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I recently bought this DVD after renting it from NetFlix. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and I thought it was perfect in every way. \\"Once\\" adeptly incorporates musical numbers into a drama of unrequited love and artistic triumph. It tells the story of a street musician (Glen Hansard) in Dublin who is depressed following a recent breakup with a woman he loved. He develops a friendship with a Czech immigrant (Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;) who shares his interest in making music. The story is rather simple, but the genius of the film is the way the song numbers reflect how the two feel about each other. I can't wait to watch it again, and to hear the songs!

006113399X|5.0|There is a serial killer in Oslo, Norway who has offed a few people, and has also turned his wrath on a huge tree. This is just one puzzlement among many that are encountered as we follow dedicated detective Harry Hole on his search for the murderer. Actually he is unaware of the slaughtered tree, but this curious killing is an important part of the story.<br /><br />Harry Hole has been assigned to desk duty after he comes close to murdering an American Secret Service agent. He's a good detective, though, and early on he comes across a report of a strange shell casing found in the woods. The report is generally ignored, but Harry checks into it, and finds that it undoubtedly comes from an expensive sniper's rifle rarely, if ever, found in Norway.<br /><br />This is one of those flashback novels, and we are periodically taken from 2000 Norway to 1942 Leningrad. I'm not a flashback fan, but the wartime sections regarding Norwegian soldiers fighting for Germany are quite interesting, and of course the wartime events have a bearing on Harry's current day investigation.<br /><br />Harry is a solitary sort of guy, and he encounters personal hardships in his search for the killer, but he even finds romance as time goes on. Of course everything works out in the end. Or does it? There is one tantalizing loose end that leaves the reader with an ominous feeling.<br /><br />This is a wonderful mystery full of interesting, well developed characters. It's also refreshingly different from the run of the mill panic driven plots that are all too frequent these days. We move slowly and steadily through a book that is well written and engaging.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|After the disaster that was Rocky V I was little skeptical about seeing this movie but I'd seen all of the others and needed closure.  Some Rocky sequels are better than others. I think it's fitting to save the best for last.  This is a good film on its own. You could really watch the first Rocky and this one and be completely satisfied. Although you'd miss out on Mr. T and Carl Weathers in their glory days.  You can sense that Rocky Balboa was a very personal and emotional film for Stallone and he gives Rocky all the respect he deserves.  Be careful loyal fans.  This sequel might even make you cry.  But not for the same reason Rocky V did. Go see this film even if you missed the other sequels. Farewell Rocky.  We're going to miss you.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I don't know how to add to the great comments this incredible film has received. It is a masterpiece and I know that word gets thrown around a lot but this film is simply a piece of film perfection. I am much more into action films or sci fi and so when I watched this a few nights ago it really took total of my attention. With all the recent films I've watched in the past few years, I admit I became a bit jaded and not at all interested in all the 'best films' like this year but I am glad I went back and visited the Best Film from 1999. It is a special film.

B0011FXLCC|4.0|The world slows down and obeys the pace you've stumbled into.  Weak stomachs, all encompassing warmth and the way she blinks her eyes; oh, the way she blinks.   You're in love.  Inhibitions bow and step aside as you two walk through the purity of the newness:  the honeymoon period.      Over time this freshness subsides and affection gets lost in a labyrinth of comfort.  The desire to impress morphs into a fear of complacency and before you know it, you've grown apart.  You part ways and move on reluctantly only to run into each other years later and come to find things weren't really as off as they seemed.  She's still got that blink you fell in love with.    Thus is my relationship with Golfrapp.  \\"Felt Mountain\\", with its modern cabaret noir was so original, so new and around every turn never failed to consume me with its spell.  Then astray they went into the disco electro-pop direction completely abandoning what so easily drew me in.  \\"Seventh Tree\\" is a welcomed return to form and eases the strain of having lost Goldfrapp, though not enough to be completely convinced they're back.    The gentle strums of opener, `Clowns', sees Alison hunched over a microphone so delicately serenading over acoustic guitar and subtle string arrangements that you can almost feel her breath on your neck.  Throughout \\"Seventh Tree\\", this extension of Felt Mountain adorns every track.    Where we see a progression is in the percussion and simple song structure.  Songs like `Little Bird' spend their entire duration building to a powerful but understated drum climax.  Others use electronic beats such as those used on \\"Black Cherry\\" and \\"Supernature's\\" more dance-inspired cuts but become slowed and turned down to give these tracks a strong pop feel.  `Happiness' incorporates the electro-weirdout sounds that gave \\"Felt Mountain\\" its uniqueness, but here in moderation and to quite perfect pop dilution.    All said, \\"Seventh Tree\\" is beautiful pop holding most of its distinction in AlisonGoldfrapp's voice.  Will Gregory's production is at once reserved, but given a fair number of listens the way he underscores his muse's vocals is extremely satisfying.  There is nothing groundbreaking here but, this guy at least, is so happy to be touched by what he fell in love with in the first place after such a long, uneasy absence.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|-This review pertains to Nosferatu: The Ultimate DVD Edition-<br /><br />In 1922, German director [[ASIN:B0000DZTUC Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau]] released his film Nosferatu - Eine Symphonie des Grauens (in English this title translates to Nosferatu - A Symphony of Horror), which not only brought the thirty-three year old director into prominence among Germany's greatest filmmakers, but also gave the world what is perhaps the greatest horror film ever made.<br />Loosely based upon Bram Stoker's 1897 novel [[ASIN:0743498038 Dracula]], the screenplay was written by Henrik Galeen. However, either Murnau and the other filmmakers didn't understand the complexities of copyright law or they simply didn't bother to get legal permission to adapt Stoker's novel into a motion picture. In vain they tried to avoid having legal action taken against them by changing the names of the characters from the novel.<br />The film's shoot, which commenced early in July of 1921, took Murnau, his cast and crew across Germany. Nosferatu was released through independent production studio, Prana-Film, which was a German studio founded by Albin Grau, a noted producer, artist, and occultist. It was Albin Grau who first suggested Bram Stoker's gothic horror novel as a potential film project for the foundling studio. Other than Murnau, it was Grau who was responsible for the eerie, expressionistic atmosphere of Nosferatu, as he was not only the film's producer but also the costume designer, set designer, and artistic director.<br />The film would finally be released on March 4 of 1922 and despite an extensive marketing campaign and great critical acclaim, the film was only a modest commercial success. Bram Stoker's widow felt that the film too closely resembled her late husband's book, so as a result she sued Murnau and the film's small studio, Prana-Film. She had the courts order the film to be pulled from theatres and worse, she demanded that all prints of the film were to be destroyed. Thankfully some copies survived destruction or else we should not be able to view Murnau's penultimate masterpiece today.<br />Nosferatu featured a talented cast, which was headed by intense character actor Max Schreck, whose name literally translates to \\"maximum terror\\". Schreck played the vampire Count Orlok, not as a sex symbol or a handsome yet violent monster, but rather as a vile rat-like being that felt no human emotions; only a parasitic bloodlust. The rest of the cast included Gustav Von Wangenheim as Hutter, Alexander Granach as Knock, Greta Schroeder as Ellen, and John Gottowt as Professor Bulwer.<br /><br />The story begins in 1838, when young Hutter is sent to Transylvania by the sinister estate broker Knock, where he is to deliver documents to Count Orlok. Once there he encounters many strange things and the mysterious Count reveals himself to be a vampire. The Count finds a picture of Hutter's young innocent wife, Ellen and then journeys to Wisborg, Germany to find her. Hutter is left behind in the vampire's eerie castle until one night when he manages to escape. By the time Hutter returns to his own home in Wisborg, the Count has spread a plague across the countryside. Too weak to battle this nefarious monstrosity, Hutter unknowingly leaves Ellen vulnerable to Orlok's attack. But Ellen, having read Hutter's journal and a book about Nosferatu, prepares to destroy the Count the only way she can. She plans to sacrifice herself to the undead Count and in so doing distract him until the sun rises since the first rays of the morning sun are lethal to the Nosferatu. In the final climactic scene Count Orlok creeps into their home and feeds on the virginal heroine's blood and then he meets his demise. Ellen's self-sacrifice and her defeat of Count Orlok lifts the accursed plague from Wisborg forever.<br /><br />As a fan of both German expressionist films from the silent age and of the Dracula theme, this film has become my all-time favorite film. When I heard that KinoInternational was going to rerelease the film in a 2-disc Ultimate DVD Edition, I was thrilled. Having now seen the restoration, I must say that I am in awe. The quality of the transfer is greater than that found in any other available version. In fact I almost felt as if I were one of those lucky people who viewed this masterpiece during its original release.<br />There have been many, many releases of Nosferatu on DVD, and most of these are put out by small distribution companies. These DVD versions are typically of a very poor quality and as such are available at low prices. However there have been two prestigious distribution companies, Image Entertainment and Kino International (formerly Kino on Video), which have created high quality transfers of the film. For the latest and most impressive release, Kino International has united with Transit Film and the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Stiftung (translates to Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation). Utilizing the highest quality prints of the film available, they have to the best of their ability duplicated the look and sound of the film as it was shown in theatres in 1922. And for the first time ever, the film features the original score as composed by Hans Erdmann.<br />This 2-disc Ultimate DVD Edition includes the gloriously restored film in two versions; one with newly translated English intertitles and the other in German. This excellent DVD also includes The Language of Shadows: Murnau- The Early Years and Nosferatu documentary, which explores Murnau's early career and his connection with the occult, archival excerpts of eight other Murnau films, Nosferatu: An Historic Film Meets Digital Restoration featurette, an image gallery, and a scene comparison that examines the similarities and differences between Stoker's novel, Henrik Galeen's screenplay, and the final film. Overall this set is spectacular, but where some may be disappointed is with the content on disc two, which only contains the film with the original German intertitles. Kino could have at least included a commentary track or an alternate score. But unfortunately this was not to be the case. Now, all said the film restoration is fantastic and the special features on disc one are great which earns the Ultimate DVD Edition 5 stars, though I wish that disc two had been more elaborate in its content. Any minor complaints aside, this DVD makes a perfect gift for cineastes and horror fans alike.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br />[[ASIN:0393064506 The New Annotated Dracula]] by Bram Stoker, edited by Leslie S.

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I am a fan of both the graphic novel and of the movie. I recently bought a PS3 for christmas and planned on getting Blu-ray disk for things that would make use of the intense graphics. 300 is a perfect example of what Blu-ray is all about. On my Sony Trinitron Wega 34\\" widescreen TV its PERFECT.     I completely recommend getting this movie even if you have the standard DVD version. Hell, sell it to your poor friend for cheap!

They have not been disappointed.  This takes only an hour to an hour and a half to read, so don't be put off by the thickness of the book.  I highly recommend it to 9 year-olds as well as adults to 90 years of age.  Don't miss this wonderful book.
0385341067|4.0|This is a very interesting book indeed. The central character is a young girl caught up in civil unrest on an island in New Guinea. When all those who are able to flee the island do so, the only remaining white man, a somewhat eccentric New Zealander, begins teaching the island's children. He is not a teacher by trade and the only text he has at his disposal is a well-worn copy of Great Expectations. The scene is set for the author to explore some very interesting themes  - the clash of Western and tribal cultures, the role stories play in our lives (both our own and those from literature), the way grasping an opportunity can change our lives forever, the horrors of civil unrest.....Along the way we are treated to some truly insightful moments and some intriguing plot twists. Then somewhere near the end things go wrong. None of the ideas that have been taken up are brought to a satisfactory conclusion and the plot just seems to fade away into oblivion. I would still recommend reading the book. It is conceptually interesting and ambitious, but somehow doesn't quite get where it wants to go.
6304981635|5.0|Every so often a genius of kinesthetic flow arrives in the world; Enter the Dragon is an opportunity to witness first hand the phenominal ability of Li Jun Fan (Bruce Lee) at the very top of his craft. I feel safe in saying that there is no other martial artist put on film that has such dynamic presence and amazing focus as Lee; and Enter the Dragon captures this intensity like no other film.<br /><br />This film is the first in many ways. Not only the first Chinese/American team up of a martial arts film, it is the very first true martial arts picture ever to be filmed in English. Martial arts star Sammo Hung is highlighted in the first five minutes of the film (first time I believe) and there is even a bit part for an extremely young Jackie Chan (watch closely) as the recipient of Lee's \\"fists of fury\\".  Starring Bruce Lee, John Saxon and new-comer Jim Kelly, Lee plays a Shaolin monk that is convinced by British Authorities (at the time Governing Hong Kong) to infiltrate an island via a martial arts tournament run by a rogue Shaolin monk named Han (Played by Shih Kien). The government wants Lee to infiltrate the tournament and contact them with information of Han's activities.<br /><br />The film is laced with Lee's Zen philosophy of life. He uses martial arts as a metaphor for all of life and a vehicle in which to understand all of life's big questions. This film is Lee's final masterpiece as the Little Dragon died 6 days before the US release of Enter the Dragon. This film is a testament to an amazing human being that managed to bridge the gap between East and West. A must see for anyone interested in Martial Arts or Eastern thought.
006016848X|3.0|\\"The number one way a man can succeed in fulfilling a woman's primary love needs is through communication.\\" ~ pg. 143<br /><br />\\"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\\" is a book I had heard so much about, I actually thought I had already read it (John Gray gives a lot of blurbs). For the first half of the book I felt completely frustrated with the idea that men could just run to their cave if a woman even tried to talk to them. From the start, the idea of the \\"cave\\" only makes sense if a man is completely selfish and doesn't want to deal with the type of woman John Gray describes. Personally I don't complain all day to my husband and so he doesn't retreat to the cave as often. I also find that I have my own cave to retreat to which is where I write all my reviews.<br /><br />If I had to deal with the type of women John Gray describes I'd put a big lock on my cave door and never come back out. That is not to say that as a woman I don't have needs. But the women he describes are completely needy in the worst of ways. Who would want to come home to someone who tells you all their problems \\"all\\" the time? What about being excited to see your husband and saying something positive?<br /><br />After the first 136 pages this book starts to make more sense. \\"Just as a woman needs to feel a man's devotion, a man has a primary need to feel a woman's admiration.\\" ~ pg. 136 It is also no surprise that \\"love letters\\" are recommended. This is also found in Barbara DeAngelis' books (they were married for a few years). John Gray also answers some interesting questions:<br /><br />What are the emotional needs of men and women?<br />How can you have a more satisfying relationship?<br />What will reduce tension and conflict?<br />How can you create more passion?<br />Why does love die?<br /><br />Can this book help your relationship? I think the \\"101 Ways to Score Points with a Woman\\" is well worth the price of the book. Especially if you can get your partner to read the book too.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000P0J09W|5.0|four kids named Mikey (Sean Astin), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), Mouth (Corey Feldman) and Data (Ke Huy Quan) who call themselves \\"The Goonies\\" discover a treasure map in the attic of Mikey's house. Their beloved neighborhood is going to be a major golf course, so they go on an adventure into finding the lost buried treasure so they can all help out in protecting their beloved neighborhood. Unfortunately three ghastly criminals Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) with her sons Jake (Robert Davi) and Francis (Joe Pantoliano) are also after the treasure.<br /><br />One of the 80's most beloved adventure movies! Director Richard Donner whom made such classics like \\"Superman 1 & 2\\", \\"The Omen\\" and \\"Lethal Weapon\\" and executive producer Steven Spielburg has created a hilarious and entertaining flick for everyone to enjoy. The film co-stars the beautiful Kerri Green as hottie Andi, John Matsuzak as Sloth the lovable  deformed man and Josh Brolin as Brand, Mike's big tough brother and the acting especially by the kids are very well done. It's one of the best movies of it's time and still appeals to kids, teens and adults alike in this must see movie.<br /><br />This DVD contains great picture and sound with good extras like video/audio commentary by the cast and crew, trailer, Featurette, Outtakes, and \\"Goonies R Good Enough\\" music video by Cyndi Lapher.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book is basically about the life of two muslim women. It was required reading for my graduate class and although it didn't reach the extreme depths of despair as Solzhenitsyn's The Cancer Ward or Wallen's The Vampire Tom Bartek, it was upsetting enough. My heart really goes out to Muslim women forced to live in the manner described in this book. Somewhere, I am sure, our western culture has been partially responsible for putting a nail in the coffin of the freedom of muslim women. What it could be, the book does not go into detail, other than to describe jets screaming overhead. But American Republican foreign policy, I am sure, had a hand in the tragedy described in the book. The author describes how many muslim women commit suicide out of despair and shame and so you suspect that one of the two muslim women in the book doesn't get out alive and your suspicions are confirmed. But ironically, more Westernization might be the solution to their plight. Only time can tell. All I can say is, my brother or father or husband would never dreamed of treating me like these women are treated. Dogs in America are treated better than these two muslim women. No lie.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I've had the manga since the early 80's and was overjoyed when it showed up on VHS. I think the title was renamed  the Windriders of the Valley or some such nonsense. What a butcher job that was. Retitled and carved like a Christmas Ham,it was quite simply garbage.  This time around Studio Ghibli told Disney they could distribute it if they kept their mitts off it. And it shows, the voice actors are top-notch and the story line is kept intact. If you are looking for some classic anime you can't go wrong with this version.  I've read that the animation looks dated but i have to disagree here. It's nice to see olde anime as you can get an idea of how anime has progressed thru the years.  While it's no AKIRA as far as anime goes it still holds up quite well in today's anime circles. If you've enjoyed any of Studio Ghibli's work such as Kiki's Delivery Service , Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away then this is a must for your collection.
B000V5ZTV4|5.0|I have read this book through several times.  On the first pass much of it seemed pretty irrational.

I was able look at the rampant use of punishment and rewards in a whole new light.  I am happy I read it when I did.
079284131X|5.0|The Film: Child's Play<br />Year Made: 1988<br /><br />Overview:  The Lakeshore Strangler is chased down by a detective.  The detective shoots the famous killer and he dies, or does he?  Determined for revenge, even after death, the killer is able to send his spirit into a doll right before he dies.  A determined mother finally gets her child the doll that that he thought he always wanted. The child soon finds out that his doll named Chucky is not your average play time doll as will soon be discovered!<br /><br />Package: 5 Stars  When I bought this DVD, I had not idea this package would be so cool. This is not just a regular cover, it comes with a hologram cover with Chucky on the front.  When you turn the cover slightly, Chucky will just look at you with a innocent look on his face.  When you move it some, he will look at you with wide eyes and a knife will appear in his hand!  This alone was such a great surprise to receive.  The cover slides off and then a normal looking DVD is inside.  The DVD itself looks cool with graphics on the disc itself.  The holder holds the disc in place very well, and yet it is the push button pop out kind, so it's easy  to remove from holder also.  I wish all holders were of this same type, as it would make taking out DVDs a whole lot easier. The DVD itself includes the trailer for the film as well as some cast information.  There was no insert at all included when I opened the case, but all and all, this is a very nice package.<br /><br />Spook Meter: 3 Stars  If you enjoy the whole killer doll concept as much as I do, if you enjoy a little humor mixed in as well, your going to love Child's Play.  This film has some spooky scenes too it and it's very fun to watch. It's not a super scary film, but what makes this all come together so well is young Andy, as well as the whole look of Chucky.  This makes for a scary, and a believable concept that flows really well in the pace of events that occur as you watch this film. All the little details, really add to the creepy feeling. The TV going on when Chucky decides that he will watch the 9 'O' Clock news, I love that part! It's creepy and is a nice slow build up  to more things that occur later as the pace picks up gradually faster.  I don't want to give away many details.  One of the very best things that you will love is when Chucky laughs! It sticks with you, long after the film has ended and in this case, that's a great thing.<br /><br />Gore/Violence Meter: 3 Stars.  There is some blood/gore, but if you looking for a high blood splatter gore fest, you won't find it here.  This gets ranked 3 stars for mainly violence. If people and a doll being shot, a few fairly mildly graphic stabbings with a little blood don't bother you, then you will be fine watching Child's Play.<br /><br />Profanity Meter:  3 Strikes. There is a fair amount of bad language in this film that maybe offensive to some viewers.<br /><br />Sexual Meter:  1 Strike. This film is pretty much a 1 star on the sexual meter.  There is zero nudity, zero bed scenes, no make out stuff what so ever.  I will note one tiny part that shows nothing, but is on the suggestive side.  A woman tries to ask a man for information regarding the doll.  The man wants her to pay for his information, she tries to give him money but he wants her body instead.  He pushes her and the suggestive part is that he wants to sexually assault her, when she is then saved by the detective.  There is nothing shown, but it's something that I just wanted to give a note of warning too about that one part.<br /><br />Final thoughts: I love  this film! what can I say, I'm a huge Chucky fan.  This is a film that I can watch over and over again.  It's fun/scary/funny horror all mixed into one film that leaves you wanting more and thinking it ended way to soon because it was just so fun to watch.  If you love horror films, you can't go wrong with this one.  Give this a try, you will love Chucky! Overall, this is a 5 Star filmwithout a doubt! I must note also that yes I would love to see Child's Play on widescreen as well as other reviewers have stated also.  This version is full screen but don't worry. I read recently that a 20th anniversary special edition of Child's Play is coming soon! Don't give up hope, Chucky is going to celebrate his birthday and I'm sure he will get the widescreen treatment alone with some new extras that is sure to please any Chucky fan.  Whatever you do, I suggest any fan of Chucky should for sure pick up this full frame version as well though.  Trust me when I say, the hologram cover is worth the price in itself.love to see Child's Play on widescreen as well as other reviewers have stated also.  This version is full screen but don't worry.

Whatever you do, I suggest any fan of Chucky should for sure pick up this full frame version as well though.  Trust me when I say, the hologram cover is worth the price in itself.
B000UJBYD8|5.0|They are back! The greatest band in the whole Universe has landed a new musical effort. An artistic treasure, with contemporary issues and a classic soul. The time Astbury spent with the Doors only managed him to become more deeper a creator and critic, chanting along his world visions with Duffy´s greatest riffs thundering around again. A true record for true rockers. If this is your case, do not hesitate to listen to the Cult´s new creation. Not indicated for Dirty Little Rockstars!
B000TQAF8M|5.0|At the beginning of 2007 I first heard about Oceansize when listening to songs on the internet radio site Pandora - Homage to a Shame came on and I knew I had to get something by this band.  Their cds are rather difficult to come by in the States, so I had to purchase Everyone Into Position from iTunes - I fell in love with the band almost instantly.    Fast forward to now, after many repeated listens to Frames.  At first, I didn't think it was as good as EIP - but now it's all I've been listening to.  The songs on this album are incredibly subtle, much more so than in the past.  90% of this album is in odd meters or is polyrhythmic, yet I wasn't aware of that at first listen because of this subtlety.  One of the things that make this band so great in today's music world is that they take the complexity of so called progressive rock, but only use it to serve the compositions and not their own instrumental showboating.    The spectrum of emotions running through this music is vast and deep.  Songs on this album go in all directions, yet each is completely distinct from one another.  Commemorative 9/11 T Shirt features a hypnotizing and somewhat minimalistic piano/guitar riff that builds into a fantastic climax, a style of songwriting that Oceansize has perfected on this record.  Unfamiliar is probably the most active song aside from Sleeping Dogs - its main riff could be described as a cry of desperation.  Trail of Fire is my current personal favorite of the group, with its beautiful, ethereal opening swirl of notes.  This track is truly moving to listen to, especially when it reaches the end.    Savant is a serene landscape, reminiscent of Music for a Nurse from the previous album.  The lyrics are especially notable: \\"where others float, you and I crash land.\\"  A string section ends the song, making it stand out even more.  Only Twin is rhythmically among the most difficult of all Oceansize songs - a rhodes piano lays down a pattern in 3/4, but at a key point in thelyrics the band comes in in 5/8.  Later in the song, vocals build to an emotional climax.  An Old Friend of the Christy's is quite a different song for them, a sort of post-doom funeral dirge.  Again, the band take their time in building on the same theme, but this approach definitely works - this song's grief is unrelenting.    The last two tracks are somewhat of a juxtaposition, proving Oceansize's musical and emotional versatility.  Sleeping Dogs and Dead Lions is absolutely vicious.  Its highly Meshuggah-influenced opening riff is the most ear-catching moment on the record, along with the piercing vocals.  The song breaks down into a Disco Volante-era Mr. Bungle style section with strange guitar/vocal unisons, and really goes out with a bang - fans of A Homage to a Shame from their last album will really find something to love in this song.  Lastly, the beautiful The Frame is the Ornament/Last Wrongs of the album, closing the entire work on a decidedly positive note. Its serene and patient solo guitar opening sound post-rock, yet this song does not proceed with the self-importance and unnecessary \\"noodling\\" that plagues so much of that genre.    As you can tell, I really can't say enough about this album.  The emotions present here go through desperation, anger, determination, grief, hope, and acceptance.  If you are going through a hard time in your life, no matter what it is, I think that this album can help you get through it - it's working for me.  I can't find anything on it that I dislike.    Oceansize fans, if you don't have this yet, buy it before you buy anything else - even your groceries.    Newcomers, you'll want this, but you might want to get Everyone Into Position first, as it's more accessible at first than this album.  But, if you're a patient and appreciative listener, this might just be the purchase for you.    Oceansize is one of the most promising bands in today's musical landscape.  All of the members possess high technical ability on their instruments, but only use it sparingly and selectively.  Their compositions are infinitely more thoughtful than most of their contemporaries, using subtlety and emotion instead of blazing solos and instrumental feats.  Hopefully they will enjoy a great amount of success so we can continue to hear these wonderful new sounds.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I like this product because it was what got me hooked on System of a Down. It was the first of their albums I bought and I loved it, and i love the band. The best song on it is by far B.Y.O.B, but they're is a couple other good songs on it like Sad Statue, Old School Hollywood, and Revenga. But this is deffinetly not appropriate for people under 12 years old, mostly because of the Song Cogoro, and Violent Pornagraphy.
B000W746GK|4.0|This is a fun movie and it is fun to watch how the relationships have changed and grown from the first movie. Ron and Hermione are starting to show signs of future sub plots.
B000021YQV|4.0|I would recomend this to any system of a down fan or any rock fans, it has great songs, my 3 favorites on it are Toxicity, Chop Suey, and Prison Song.
B000067CPX|5.0|Yeah, so this record was the last one I picked up (with the exception of Stadium Arcadium) as a result of reading the Anthony Kiedis autobiography 'Scar Tissue'. I actually started my little Chili Peppers kick about halfway through the book, and listened through the albums (starting with the original 1984 self-titled release and then into the excellent 'Mother's Milk') as the band was writing and recording them in the story. It DEFINITELY added a new dynamic to each of them, and this particular record is the one the band is working on at the end of the book. I have been listening to 'By the Way' for many weeks following my completion of the book, and actually have enjoyed this one the most. No disrespect to the others -they are all great, but this album is just 'sticking'. I highly recommend this record, and for a deeper appreciation for the entire Red Hot Chili Peppers catalog, the book to go along with it.
B000007T1M|5.0|I love this cd, everyone of the songs are hard and demented. It is definatly explicit but it has the hit song sugar and my favorite song ever P.L.U.C.K (Political Lying Unholy Cowardly Killers). If you like System of a Down or rock in general this cd is a must!!!!!!!!!!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|There's been a bunch of talk regarding some issues with this version, such as flickering in certain scenes such as the Angel Falls scene.  This seems to be a very common issue between both the blu-ray and HD-DVD versions, however it is not on the regular DVD version.    I would like to state that the HD versions released and sold only at the Discovery HD store do not have these flickering problems.  But you get to listen to another person narrating instead.  There's some slightly different footage also.    Also it appears that the BBC HD versions do not contain any special features at all.  Regular DVD version has a good number of features and an extra disk containing a future earth episode.  The HD versions from Discovery HD do contain some special features, the 'creating of' scenes.  Not as much as the regular DVD, but more than the BBC HD.    Anyway, that aside, I really love this series and definately recommend it.  It is so beautiful to watch and experience.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|At the age of 67 I thought there were no more musical discoveries or joys to be had.  Then, whammo bammo, I heard Rufus singing \\"Zing Went the String of My Heart\\" and then \\"I Don't Know What It Is\\" and right there I bought all his C.D.s and DVDS.  That simple.  What a voice, what a composer, what a lyricist, what a personality, what a charmer, what an original.  This is music to change your life.  I'm going broke buying gift copies for friends.  Everyone, without exception, is overwhelmed by what they hear.  He is a beautiful child.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|To those who find the thought of a well bred lady running through the streets of Bath during the Jane Austen period incomprehensible, I recommend that we look to someone with an irrefutable knowledge of the time period. Jane Austen herself. In her book Northanger Abbey chapter 13, Thorpe has canceled an engagement Catherine Morland made with the Tilneys without her consent. In order to set the matter right she \\"walked in great agitation, as fast as the crowd would permit her.\\" Nearing her destination \\"she nearly ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of Milsomstreet.\\"     I found it perfectly reasonable that after eight years of separation and with the prospect of her not being able to express to Captain Wentworth the depth of her feelings before he left, Anne Eliot might indeed run to find him. Granted, this is an artistic license on the screenwriters part that is not in the book but one that I found believable and well acted.     I enjoyed this version immensely. Considering that they managed to condense the book into 93 minutes without losing the essense of the story was remarkable (though I would have preferred a longer movie so that some of the minor characters could have been more fleshed out and more details shown). I think it greatly improved upon the 1995 version which suffered from having older cast members (Anne Eliot should have been about 26 while Amanda Root looked to be in her 30's), a confusing script (it was hard to understand in the beginning and viewers who had not read the book were confused ie. my dad), some poor acting (Amanda Root's Anne seemed very timid and rather pathetic and it was hard for me to root for her and Wentworth),and slow pacing.  Though the 1995 version has merit and I enjoy it, I would definitely recommend this version over it.
0743298039|5.0|I loved this book.  It really kept my attention.  Very different.  A little quirky, but that's what made it so creative.  I would recommend it highly and I look forward to Ms. Setterfield writing another book.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Gilmore Girls is the best show in the entire world! This pack was so great. The epsiode guide and \\"gilmorisms\\" book were fantastic. And these dvd's had extra features that weren't on the australian indiviuals. The chemistry between Lauren and Alexis is awesome. And the quick with is hilarious. A must have for anyone!!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|wow, the original trilogy looks great on DVD.  the image is crisp. the colors more vibrant, the sound is great.  Some people will hate the changes, but they don't add a whole lot that wasn't in the special edition release of 1997 and I actually loved those additions (except for the new musical scene in Jabba's palace in ROTJ... still makes me wince!) The new changes actually help the continuity and make it feel like the movies fit together better when you watch all six.  The only new change that bothered me at first were boba fett's voice being changed to match Jango's, and young Anakin substituted at the very end of ROTJ.  Now that I am used to them though, they don't bother me at all.  In fact, I believe that is a big reason people hate them (and the new trilogy for that matter).  People just aren't used to them! Once they've been around for a while, they will be more and more accepted until they ARE just part of star wars.  That's my philosophy anyways... these movies are still classics!
B000YCLRBA|5.0|Having seen this production at the MET and HD transmission to the movies, this DVD is outstanding in every way and highly recommended as a worthy addition to your collection. For those who have seen the production at the MET, it will enhance your enjoyment of the individual performances with close-ups of facial expressions of singers and other interesting nuances and other little amusing things you might have missed if you were seated far from the stage. This DVD is specially beneficial to those seeing this opera for the first time because of the elimination of extraneous and distracting things, which allows you to focus on the dramatic and musical    inputs of the protagonists more clearly.     Having seen conventional, lavish productions of this opera in major houses, I had some apprehensions at first about how Act 3 would turn out stripped of the customary depiction of the opulence and splendor of St. Petersburg in Pushkin's time. With bare walls and just a few nice chairs around, the fantastic lighting effects and elegant coustumes made a big difference and saved this production from getting too \\"eurotrashy\\".    For me, the most important achievement of this production is the righting of the unfair characterization by critics, past and present, of the role of the poet Lenski as the \\"weakest link\\" among the principals. From  the very first time I saw this opera, I have always felt that Lenski's music was the most beautiful in the opera and that Tchaikovsky identified more with Lenski's creative nature. So, why the \\"weakest link\\" tag ? This production  provided the answer! That's why this minimalist ONEGIN is particularly helpful to first timers to the opera. By combining Acts 2 & 3 and eliminating the long intermission between the Acts & scenes as well as toning down the distracting, unnecessary elements extraneous to the story, this production allows the audience to focus not only on individual performances but the totality of their artistic contributions as well. In full lavish productions, Lenski dies at the end of Act 2. He is given a courtesy solo bow, and his night is done. After a 20-minute intermission or longer, a shot of vodka, champagne or margarita, the audience is ushered back to their seats for the beginning of Act 3.When the curtain opens, the audience is greeted by the majestic polonaise  with elegantly dressed and bejewelled ladies of St. Petersburg's upper crust society, dancers and entertainers at Prince Gremin's palatial digs. The audience then gets to hear his beautiful aria  and Onegin's two-minute arioso. Another time break for scene change, and then the final scene with Tatiana and Onegin culminating with the histrionics of their dysfunctional love relationship. End of opera - about one and a half hours after Lenski' death. Poor Lenski is a forgotten man by then. But not in this production! Here, after his death, he goes back to his dressing room, have coffee or something stronger (Bjoerling used to do it,why not), and half an hour later, he goes out on stage to receive the audience's feedback with the rest of the cast. That's   the way it should be, and the composer would have loved it.    This DVD may not be surpassed for a long time. The cast is just outstanding, from the three principals who are all at their best, down the line to Lenski's second at the duel scene. Renee Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovsky will be very hard to top as Tatiana and Onegin because, not only do they possess beautiful voices and fine acting abilities, they also must have spent a lot of time studying and rehearsing together. It shows in their chemistry. Ramon Vargas gave the most vivid portrayal of the poet's persona that I have ever witnessed, and his subtle, well controlled and very effective acting  covered a wide gamut of emotions from the lyrical Act 1 through varying degrees of distrust, jealousy and anger, and the heartbreaking resignation in Act 2. He even introduced a little humor in the middle of his ardent declaration of chaste love to the seated Olga by gently pushing the tray of goodies away from her to get her full attention. I missed that one in the theater, and I'm thankful for the DVD. His voice was absolutely gorgeous, and his singing superb throughout. His arioso in Act1 is just as beautiful as Onegin's aria at the end of the act. For some strange reason, Hvorostovsky received only a polite audience response with no bravos. I thought he gave a flawless and terrific rendition of the aria. In Act 2 Scene 1, Vargas dominated the singing in his reprimand of Olga for her flirting with Onegin, his private confrontation with Onegin and the escalation ending in throat grabbing before the guests. He opened the  big quintet with chorus  with a tender and touching recollection of the happiness he found at the Larin's home as an adolescent and ended the ensemble with a powerful, pained farewell to his beloved Olga. Lenski's aria Act2 Scene2, as sublimely sung by Vargas and lovingly accompanied by the great Met Orchestra under the super conductor of choice, Valery Gergiev, is one for the ages. Vargas just simply dominated all of Act 2. Renee Fleming dominated Act 1 with her wonderful, well nuanced Letter Scene which was warmly received by the audience.    So, is the \\"weakest link\\" going to steal the show from the Star?  After Act3 Scene1, Lenski was still ahead in my tally. DH was in his best voice, and that's a lot. He must deliver the best performance of his life to catch the poet. Fleming could pass him too if he didn't. Fueled by Fleming's incredible acting and singing, which I have never seen from her before, he caught fire in the last six minutes, and the rest is history. He nailed that last note like Rigoletto's anguished maledezione with all the power and pathos he could muster. My verdict: it's a 3-way tie ! When Vargas came out for curtain calls , the audience did not forget the pleasures he had given them and gave him back a tremendous ovation with confetti as they did the other two stars. Aren't we blessed to have three stars of this caliber with an excellent group of supporting singers, the best opera orchestra in the world under the direction of the genius from St. Petersburg?  Get this DVD fast, you will not be sorry.
B000XTCBWS|5.0|Testament's release of the complete 1955 Bayreuth Ring, with Joseph Keilberth conducting the Bayreuth Festspielhaus orchestra in top form, must be seen as the prime recommendation. Not that there are no other excellent Bayreuth sets - here I want to mention Knappertsbusch's ([[ASIN:B00004RCZL Merit - Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen / Knappertsbusch]]), Krauss' ([[ASIN:B000E5KQL4 Wagner: The Ring]]) and B&ouml;hm's ([[ASIN:B000025ESY Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen]]) - but the ensemble, sound (of course, the stereo sound is vintage but quite good for its age - including all stage noices...), and interpretation caught on these recordings are first rate making this set truly essential.<br /><br />Cast is more or less the dream team incarnated, including Varnay, Hotter, Greindl, Neidlinger, and Vinay - all in best possible voice. This fact only makes these performances essential listening, but now we must also toss in another fact: Joseph Keilberth's superb, swift and perfectly consistent interpretation. It is no surprise that Wieland Wagner requested his talent on several occasions.<br /><br />Keilberth's interpretation is thus wholly different when compared with Knappertsbusch's, the legendary Bayreuth conductor, famous for his lethargic, heavy, somewhat inconsistent, but nonetheless superb performances.<br /><br />Collectors need both these cycles, of course, in addition to those mentioned above, but if you look for the \\"prime recommendation\\", I suggest that the Keilberth Ring is the best possible choice. Here we get a superb interpretation from a great Wagner conductor, outstanding vocal forces from classic Wagner artists, and a live Bayreuth performance in fine stereo sound. It cannot be better than this - ever.<br /><br />The only drawbacks are (1) a \\"modernist\\" production mistake, which, I have heard, was due to Carl Orff's advice. Instead of the sound of 18 tuned anvils in the Nibelheim scene of Das Rheingold we hear the sound of Mixtur-Trautonium, some sort of early synthesizer, which is supposed to imitate that sound. Another technical disturbance (2) is a gas-fueled fire machine, audible throughout the scene. This causes a great deal of hiss in Nibelheim, and the \\"anvil\\" sound of Mixtur-Trautonium itself is not entirely satisfying even if not as bad as in Kna's recording (Music & Arts). Prospective buyers should note this, because it may be a sonic disappointment. A third drawback (3) is due to Testament's editing of Siegfried: each of the acts is under 80 minutes (78+, 75+, 75+). Thus they would easily fit on three CDs. Despite that, Testament split the acts over four CDs. I asked Testament about this in an email, and they replied as follows: \\"Maybe they can fit on 3 but we simply followed the pq plot of the Solti Ring which everyone accepts as the standard, until now it seems.\\" An astonishing answer, in my view. It is just terrible that the Solti set has this kind of influence.<br /><br />But these drawbacks are soon forgotten. Forgotten are also Decca's Solti and DG's Karajan Rings (leave them to the completists...): these sterile studio conceptions are dead matter when compared to this lively, electrifying and memorable live performance. This is the desert island Ring.<br /><br />Strongly recommended!early synthesizer, which is supposed to imitate that sound.

6305428557|4.0|A pleasant, unusual comedy. Supposedly based on a real story (but probably not) and set in 1917, it tells the story of two English cartographers (Hugh Grant and Ian McNeice) who arrive in a Welsh village in order to take the measure of the nearby mountain, considered the pride of the locals. According to the height (more specifically, if it is higher than 1,000 feet), it will be determined whether it is indeed a mountain or it is just a hill. When the first measure turns out that it is just a few feet under the 1,000 mark, the anxious villagers will take action. In order to makes sure that it is recorded as a mountain, they will transport dirt and soil from the fields, and to the peak, bucket by bucket. At the same time, they will do everything to prevent the two cartographers from leaving town before they can take a second measure. Eventually, Grant, who falls in love with a local girl (Tara Fitzgerald), will help the villagers in their task (the other cartographer is much more meaner and dismissive of the Welsh). This is a small film in every sense, but it is very warm and funny.

0451205766|3.0|Like most people, I saw the movie long before I every dreamed of reading the book.  I was not sure what I exactly expected, but I was very disappointed.  I found Puzo to be nothing above an average write, and the writing throughout was clumsy.  Case in point: count the times he writes, \\"made his bones.\\"  That line appears once in the movie (thanks, Mo!), but seemingly arrives in the book every several pages.  It was painful.    That said, the story is great, and it was wonderful to see some Godfather II story worked into original (which was a surprise).  I give the book a slight recomendation, but only as a way to aid the movie.  This is certainly a case where the movie is far superior to the book, and the book's worth is more as a novelty related to the movie, rather than on is own merits.

Well, not for me it wasn't. I thought it was totally believable.<br />Everything is not black and white - good and bad ... That would be a perfect world, and unfortunately, there is no such thing.<br /><br />I say to those of you who have not seen it, To at least rent it, and give it a chance. I rented it, and am going to buy it tomorrow. It is THAT good !<br /><br />Also, After seeing this, I look forward to anything else Ben Affleck directs in the future.
6304712944|5.0|My mother took me to see Camelot in 1969 at the age of 11.  I absolutely fell in love with Richard Harris as King Arthur. There have been many King Arthur's that have come and gone, but none with the passion, yet sadness the Mr. Harris put into it. The scenery and the costumes were amazing and the storyline was wonderful. It truly let your imagination run wild. A movie like this could not be made today because there are no four letter words, no obscenities, so what would be the point in going? I truly wish more kids could see the broadway musicals that I was lucky enough to be brought up on. Gigi, Can Can, Oliver, My Fair Lady and so many more. You must see this movie and truly enjoy the actors/actresses. Vanessa Redgrave was amazing and so beautiful as Guinevere. Lancelot was the ultimate knight and you wanted to Kill Mordred! David Hemmings was soooo evil. I hope this helps. And by the way, April 24, 1987, my dream came true. I met Richard Harris. He was wonderful and charming and so funny. No one can tell a story like him. Camelot, to this day, is my all time favorite movie!
B000R4SMCW|4.0|Anthony Hopkins plays this kind of part so well, it's easy to criticize him for doing another \\"Hannibal Lector\\" role. Although this is an all too familiar premise, it had enough new twists in it to save it from being routine. The movie will keep your interest as you try to keep up with this clever film. If I could change one thing it would be the ending, which took me by surprise as I thought there might be one more twist left in the story. Oh well.......it's still a pretty good court room film. I rate it 3 1/2 stars.

B000TGCR38|5.0|Now I am not going to call this a MASTERPIECE FILM by any stretch of the imagination, but as a commercial, mass-entertainment thriller it simply does everything right.  Namely:<br /><br />1. Solid acting, directing, and dialogue: nothing to make you say, \\"puh-leeeez!\\" and choke or gag on your popcorn as often happens in your typical high-cheese, big-budget Hollywood thriller, especially in their last 10 minutes or so.<br /><br />2. An engagingly original and unpredictable plot and characters: will not bore you to tears because everything that's going to happen in the film is systematically telegraphed/foreshadowed within the first 10 minutes, and the characters are not all a bunch of 2-dimensional cliches chosen by a Hollywood focus group.<br /><br />3. Beautiful sets/locations and cinematography, and a very luscious Carice van Houten who is just as good an actress as she is a powerfully sexual and intoxicating woman, even though she has to dye her hair blonde during the movie.<br /><br />I have to giggle at the usual parade of prudish American reviewers here on Amazon who are (gasp!) shocked and offended by (gasp!) the perhaps half dozen all-too-fleeting, piddling nude (gasp!) and sexual (gasp!) scenes.<br /><br />Actually, compared to Verhoeven's infamous \\"Basic Instinct\\" (a decent thriller, though a bit over the top sometimes) this film is just barely PG-13.  The sexual scenes are not anywhere as prolonged or as graphic, and the nudity is tastefully done in a soft-light, airbrushed kind of way.  There is one rather cute scene where van Houten is shown dying her pubes blonde, but all you see is fur, nothing else...sheesh!  I would personally have preferred not to be subjected to full frontal and rear nudity of the one old, fat, pasty and hairy German officer (Franken), but that's just because I'd much rather look at the likes of Ms. Van Houten in her birthday suit, thanks very much!<br /><br />Can't disagree with the many film critics who've hailed this as Paul Verhoeven's best works in many, many years.  Mind-boggling that this is the same guy who made the abysmally God-awful \\"Showgirls\\" (1995)!<br /><br />Just nevermind the prudes and the Bible-thumpers, they're kind of like mosquitoes in a swamp: unavoidable when you live in America..

B0006IINSW|5.0|The Pineapple Thief are generally labeled as a \\"progressive\\" rock band, although this label is commonly misconstrued as meaning, \\"sounds like old Genesis, E. L. P.  and YES music.\\" I think many people forget that Pink Floyd were labeled a progressive rock band, and yet they sound nothing like Genesis, E. L. P.  or YES. The progressive rock tag was actually meant to imply that the band were not just writing simple three minute tunes about something mundane like the most trivial aspect of a boy meets girl relationship. Being Progressive meant literally to progress song structured concepts, musically and/or lyrically, into something with perhaps more depth and meaning. Sometimes this simply meant that there were more layers to the music, or more meaning behind the lyrics, so that even if the song did happen to be about a boy meets girl relationship, there would be more exploration into something like the psychological aspects of that relationship rather than just how they want to kiss each other and/or bed each other down for the night. Progressive also meant that the music itself was presented in a different way, sometimes taking the full spectrum of what is out there musically and molding that extensive range of sound, shape and colour into something unique. With this in mind you could easily say that The Beatles did their share of progressive rock music (think Tomorrow Never Knows. Eleanor Rigby and all of Sgt. Peppers to name just a few things). Steve Wilson of Porcupine Tree seems reluctant to label his band as progressive, but again I think he sees the tag having that same old archaic reference to Genesis and YES. There is no question that Porcupine Tree progresses the concepts of rock music by exploring the many different styles of rock and forging music from it that is their own, as does Radiohead, who also explore new ways to present musical ideas (they also feel disinclined to be associated with that old Progressive rock label). Regardless of what they feel,the label applies. The Pineapple Thief also fall into this same category, and I used both Porcupine Tree and Radiohead as examples, because it is with those two bands that The Pineapple Thief share the most in common. The Thief do not constrain themselves to one musical idea, but rather take in the full spectrum of what is out there and mold it into their own image while always searching for new ways to express those musical concepts. Songs like \\"Subside\\" and \\"Vapor Trails\\", do not follow any conventional means of communicating musical ideas in a radio friendly manner, and yet they manage  to just as successfully convey their tunes, without sounding like they are trying to force them into some different mold, like trying to fit a jigsaw puzzle piece in where it doesn't belong. The Pineapple Thief's songs sound natural the way they are, not contrived in such a way as to be different just for the heck of it, and that is the sign of a truly great progressive band, which The Thief certainly are. That said I do not hold to the opinion that Variations of a Dream is their best record. While it most certainly is an excellent record (CD, whatever), I feel that their 2007 release, \\"What We Have Sown\\" is better. Nevertheless, you can't go wrong with a Pineapple Thief album, and Variations of a Dream is a worthwhile addition to any music lovers collection who wants more from their music than the one dimensional, same old same old.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is the most romantic story EVER. it is a total tear jerker, but i love it!
0385333846|5.0|This was my first Kurt Vonnegut book. It took perhaps 50 pages for me to get into his unique style of writing. I did not particularly enjoyed it at first. I was especially annoyed by the constant use of the phrase, \\"so it goes\\". But once I decided to go with the unusual style and writing I began to enjoy it a lot. The story follows the life of a WWII veteran. and jumps through time (past, present and future) constantly. Time lines are not separated by chapters and within one page, time jumps around several times. To make it more interesting the protagonist believes (or maybe he really was, but I believe it is not important whether he really was) that he was abducted by people from another planet and that he can travel through time. The reader can interpret this part as science fiction or merely that the protagonist is mentally ill. Vonnegut describes his life on the other planet, where he is in a zoo. Despite what sounds like a complex plot, the story is surprisingly easy to follow and delightful.     The author admits that he intended to write an anti-war book. Through comedy and the story's unique characters, he delivers an entertaining book that will leave you with a lot to think about. The craziness of the story parallels the craziness of war. I highly recommend it and even if you don't end up liking the book, it will be a short time investment. It took me about a day to get through it.
B000QXDED6|5.0|***** 2006. Co-written and directed by Zack Snyder. The Battle of Thermopylae (480 B.C.) between the Spartans and the Persians told to the younger generations. Apart of the comic book mood, certain scenes remind us of the epic works of the neo-classic painter Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825). The film is an undeniable accomplishment. Masterpiece.
1563890119|5.0|Packed full of human emotion and real depth, this collection of essays invites you to consider the relevancy of dreams to your life.  Throughout this vivid journey, you might discover a renewed interest in the concept of dreams, and how they may be impacting the quality of your life, and of those around you.  Or perhaps how they SHOULD be affecting you, and those around you.    While a page-turner, it also causes you to pause.  Beautiful drawings and brilliant colors beseige each page, perfectly complementing the dialogue and narration, causing you to WANT to spend the time required to drop your eyes on every inch of the page.  I found myself looking up and down, physically moving my head and my hands, turning the book this way and that, to make sure that I understood what I was supposed to take from the two pages in front of me.  The visuals are stimulating, thoughtful, and passionate.  It's even worthwhile to randomly pick a page, after you've read the book, to look at the artwork again, to make sure you remember the underlying message and how it might matter to you.    For those leading a boring life right now, read something like this.  At minimum it's a good distraction but, most likely, it will be a good launching point for thinking creatively about whatever you put your focus on, and move you to consider the characters around you as having their own quests, challenges, and dreams.
B0012K1ILW|2.0|I am so disappointed words cannot describe.  I want my money back and I will not be buying pt 2 or 3.

B0012K1ILW|5.0|If most of the Music you listen to comes via the Radio or Videos than this CD is not for you. If your a opened minded Music lover that rarely listens to the Radio or watch videos than this is for you. It's refreshing to see a well known artist to step outside the box. This is exceptional in the same way Marvin Gays \\"What's goin on?\\" Album was. The social commentary and will probably still be as relevent 5 to 10 years from now. One of my favorite line is from Twinkle \\"They say their Grandfathers and Grandmothers worked hard for nothing cause they still in the Ghetto\\".  The word play is much deeper than what casual listener might want to listen to. This is will become a Classic. For the people that says it's  weird that's cool because I don't think she put it out there for you anyway. This for the people not looking for the same old formula.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Dario Marianelli's Academy Award-nominated original music score superbly complements Director Joe Wright's acclaimed 2005 big screen production of \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" The individual music pieces, featuring piano, violin, and chamber music suitable to Regency-era England, help create the mood of Jane Austen's classic romance of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, as portrayed by acting leads Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen.<br /><br />A number of the pieces support the dance sequences in the movie, whether the relatively informal village get-together at the town hall, or the more formal ball at Netherfield. Other pieces complement key emotional moments in the movie. For example, \\"The Living Sculptures of Pemberly\\" and \\"Georgiana\\" pace Elizabeth Bennet's exploration of Mr Darcy's grand home of Pemberly and her encounter with his young sister.  The soaring \\"Liz on top of the world\\" scores Elizabeth's exploration of the Peak District.  \\"Your Hands Are Cold\\" complements the movie's climax, the fateful meeting at dawn between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />This haunting movie soundtrack is very highly recommended to fans of 2005's \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"
0553381687|5.0|Well I must start out with 2 warnings. The first being that you have to be able to stand being confused for the first 200 pages. You also have to be able to \\"skim\\" through names when he starts talking about lesser houses and their lords and ladies. George RR Martin creates such a realistic world that at point he can be too meticulous. But it eventually weaves itself into a whole world, not too unlike The Hobbit. Ultimately the first book focuses on 12-15 main people, only some of them being POV characters.<br /><br />The second warning is that, once you start reading this book, you won't be able to stop. It is an all-enveloping book that will be on your mind all day, even at work or at night before you sleep. It is a true tome (4000 pages and counting combined books) and you won't want them to end. The characters are round, the dialouge rich and believable, and the plot intersting. Beware though, GRRM is not afraid of killing your favorite charcters because he wants you to be truly afraid when they get in danger.<br /><br />Overall this is in my top 3 books ive ever read. And I've read quite a bit.
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is sooo good to me! I've heard every album that they've put out with the exception of the latest one, and I must say that I love each and every one of them!!! (Even the one that they did with Jay-Z.) But back to the point at hand. This album is so emotionally charged that it acually makes you get up involved with what you're listening to. That is why I love this album so much!
0375424474|5.0|If you like to understand how things work, you will enjoy this book.  If you do any kind of design work, you will appreciate what Nature has accomplished through the continuous development of an idea as it evolves into more complex or more broadly applicable uses.  It is refreshing to see that the iterative way we improve our own creations is \\"normal\\" and that truly useful things do not pop out fully functional or featured on the first pass.    All in all, a pleasant read.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album had my attention from \\"Going Under\\" to \\"My Immortal {Rock Version}\\" (If you have the bonus song.) Anyways, I love this album so much, and after buying it...I'm still listening to it. Amy's voice is so haunted and just plain beautiful!!!

B000FTWB7G|5.0|OH MY SWEET LOVE!!! I love this album so much. I bought it (from Amazon) and I just got it this past Monday, and I must say that I'm already addicted to this album. I'm listening to it right now as we speak, and I love it!!! Especially \\"Cloud Nine\\". Evanescence caught my attention when I first heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\", and now they've still got me at hello!!!
B000002AGN|5.0|It goes without saying, I think, that it is fair to call this album \\"over-rated\\", if only because so many jazz critics have said that it is one of the albums any collection must have.   Having heard the Brubeck quartet play live on several occasions back in the old days, it is difficult to shake the bliss felt on those occasions from the somewhat bland and detached air felt on this recording.    However, who will ever get tired of listening to Desmond's sublime \\"Take Five\\"?  Or, for that matter, \\"Blue Rondo a la Turk\\".    The music has been extensively analyzed by other reviewers and I choose to come at it simply from the viewpoint of the album's ability, time and again, to give pure listening pleasure.
B00005ABIP|4.0|\\"Prolonging The Magic\\" was almost like an afterglow from [[ASIN:B000003CKH Fashion Nugget]]. The edginess mellowed into warm smoothness, the sarcasm burnished into whisky-warm wit. The charm was still obvious and, at first glance, little had changed. After all, the first thing you hear is a song called \\"Satan Is My Motor.\\" Around the middle of the album is a delightful bit of nonsense called \\"Sheep Go To Heaven.\\"<br /><br />But then the little things start to stick in your mind, like the Country Western pedal steel that glides through \\"Walk On By.\\" Or the jazzy underpinnings of \\"When You Sleep\\" (featuring Cake's secret weapon, Vincent DiFiore's trumpet). And the descriptively solid slice of life \\"Alpha Beta Parking Lot.\\"<br /><br />For those looking for the alt-rock ironic pop will find plenty here. There's the hit single of \\"Never There\\" and the equally good \\"You Turn The Screws.\\" John McCrea's trademark sing-speak is one of the things that makes Cake such a dependable pleasure, and on those songs he works it to perfection. There may not be an arch cover (ala \\"Nugget's\\" take on \\"I Will Survive\\" or [[ASIN:B0002SPNQQ Pressure Chief's]] go at Bread's \\"Guitar Man\\"), but there is a straightforward - well almost - love song in \\"Let Me Go.\\"<br /><br />I'd probably alternate \\"Prolonging The Magic\\" as my second favorite Cake album next to \\"Pressure Chief,\\" but as far as the mellowing of Cake after the departure of Greg Brown (who wrote \\"The Distance\\"), this is as close to perfection as the band ever got again.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Like many other fans I am bursting at the seams in anticipation for this film. I am somewhat confused by the reviews though. Some reviews are saying it is lame and others are saying that is is the \\"best thing since sliced bread.\\" So you can imagine, but I am going to view it with an open mind and I am really looking forward to seeing what they did with their significanly higher budget. But at least we can be thankful that their are movies to follow to help wrap up specific hanging storylines. I also attended the Stargate Convention in LA recently and Cliff Simon (Ba'al) said that there are already two more movies planned after Arc of Truth and Continuum. Because apparently Continuum leaves a gap at the end?? So who knows if that will happen, right, but wouldn't it be brilliant to enjoy two more Stargate films??? (but the wait is a killer!!)

0143057375|5.0|I really cannot say enough wonderful things about Eckhart Tolle or his writings. I read his words and I am stunned with realization. What he gives us is so simple and clear and wise. I feel that I've always known what he shares, but without recognizing it. A light bulb pops on in my head, and it is that \\"Ah hah!\\" moment that oh so subtly makes a gigantic difference in the way you see and what you do. Above and beyond happiness or sorrow, there is joy in this utter peace that does not come and go, but is always there. And how great that months and months after \\"A New Earth\\" was published, Amazon users are still reading it and reviewing it. I'm guesing that, like myself, a lot of people recieved this book as a holiday gift, and WHAT a gift! If only our leaders could sat down and be taught what it contains.     Thanks, Eckhart! I have no idea how a human being acquired such miraculous wisdom, but I am eternally grateful that you recieved it and give it.
076781326X|4.0|I saw this version of \\"Oliver\\" in the theatre years ago and, once again, I am enjoying it.  I particularly enjoyed the music, especially the one in which Fagin is \\"reviewing the situation.\\"  That song applies to many situations in life, I have found.
0553296981|5.0|The last time I really read the diary of Anne Frank, I was nine.<br />This time, I'm a grown-up. My reaction to reading Anne Frank this time was as if I had blinders taken away from my eyes. Instead of just seeing a girl in hiding and feeling oppressed with the sadness of her unfulfilled life, I saw a profoundly real teen-age girl with unbelievable wisdom and hosesty. She seems to be the compliation of all the inner knowledge, wisdom, sexual and emotional development of all girls. She is almost like the western world's Shakespeare for girls. For example, I was enthralled with her intimate feelings and thoughts around her crush on Peter. Lots of girls fall in love or have a crush, but few know how to process their feelings. Anne seems to understood so much about the ego development of a person in transition from child to woman. What she is able to put into words about her crush should help any girl experiencing deep and complex feelings.<br /><br />I think every woman should take some time and re-read Anne Frank. You will certainly fall in love with her in a different way than the first time around. You may find yourself sobbing later, as I found myself, when her love of life and feelings and insights about growing-up, welled up inside of me with the realization that Anne never got a chance to do all the things that most of us women take for granted: the husband, the kids, the first apartment, friends over, pets, just getting out in the fresh air!<br /><br />Anne held on to her ideals and dreams and she hoped that there would be a time that she could carry them out. She didn't make it, but we have. And so if every woman who reads this book can just be a little more insightful, a little more caring, a little more loving, listen a little harder to kids and teens-then in a way, we have carried out, as best we can, her ideals.
0312330537|5.0|This was all-around the best book I have ever read. It is engaging in a way that few novels are. All day, I would be excited to get home to continue reading this book. I am excited to see what the author does next.

0920668372|5.0|When I first read this book in the bookstore, it brought tears to my eyes.  I immediately purchased several books to send to new mothers and new grandmothers.<br /><br />The story very poignantly shows the circle of life in a family, as well as the circle of love. Just as our parents love us, so we love each of our children even though they may not always be perfect.  Robert Munsch, as always, does a wonderful job of capturing the antics of a child and the reaction of a parent.<br /><br />His repeating verse of I love you forever, I love you always is a soothing verse for all children and makes it a great bedtime story for children. A book both adults and children will love,this is one of my favorite books!
B0009F9O08|5.0|In 1974 Bowie released the incredible \\"Diamond Dogs\\" album, then went on tour to promote it. This \\"live\\" document of the tour features his best-known album tracks of the previous five years, performed before an enthusiastic crowd at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania (not in Philadelphia, as noted on the sleeve).    Fans only acquainted with Bowie's prolonged dance-music era will be surprised at how different (and how good) he was during these earlier years. Here he sings material from his albums \\"Space Oddity\\", \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\", \\"Hunky Dory\\", \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", \\"Aladdin Sane\\", and \\"Diamond Dogs\\". Indeed, this set functions as a \\"greatest hits\\" of his most popular songs up until that time.    The aforementioned albums were the most unusual of the early '70's. Truly strange words and music - like nothing ever heard before. And his \\"live\\" show and theatrics were like nothing ever seen before! Artistically, he would never be the same again. After this he released the much different-sounding \\"Young Americans\\". \\"David Live\\" was the \\"last hurrah\\" of what many people (myself included) consider to be the most creative and entertaining period of his life.     Having disbanded the Spiders From Mars a year earlier, Bowie is accompanied by Tony Newman-drums;Pablo Rosario-percussion;David Sanborn-alto sax,flute;Richard Grando-baritone sax,flute;Mike Garson-piano,mellotron;Herbie Flowers-bass;Gui Andrisano and Warren Peace-vocal backings;Michael Kamen-electric piano,moog,oboe;and Earl Slick-guitar.    These veterans all play fantastically, but of special note are the contributions of Mike Garson and Earl Slick. Their piano and guitar parts dominate, and between them they make the record something special. The sax parts are nice too. They tamper with the arrangements on many songs, slowing some down and speeding others up - or they insert tinkly piano or fiery guitar that didn't exist on the studio versions. For these differences alone this is worth collecting.    While I highly recommend buying all of the above Bowie albums, this is a good place to start for a curious newcomer or a casual fan. See what all the buzz was about!
B0000DCGT0|5.0|The product came on time and was much appreciated.  The movie was a gift and the receiver loved it.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I enjoy listening to Once so much that I recently ordered it as a birthday gift for a close friend.  I had my own copy which I have listened to over and over for the past umpteen months.  All the songs are mellow with the exception of Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy which is short and sweet.  I was rooting for the song off the album, Falling Slowly, during the Academy Awards and was thrilled that it won an Oscar for Marketa Irglova and Glen Hansard.  You won't regret ordering this CD and while you're at it, get the DVD too!<br />Janice A.

0316776963|5.0|There isn't much more I can say about this book that hasn't already  been said but I will try anyway.  I read this quite a few years ago on a friend's recommendation.  And OH MY GOODNESS!  My words do not do this book justice!!  Sedaris' take on life and his way of telling stories is unlike anything I have ever read or heard.  This book was so laugh-out-loud funny that at any given moment while reading this book I could be found spitting coffee out of my mouth, bending over in laughter and yes maybe even wetting my pants!! (okay, so the last one never happened but this book is just that funny!!)
B0010X8NF0|3.0|Being a Wes Anderson fan, I have awaited \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" anxiously.  The music, the settings, the actors usually are excellent in all regards.    However, I must say that I was disappointed.  The plot seemed thin and somewhat hackneyed.  It's hard seeing Owen Wilson bandaged up throughout the movie, and harder yet to deal with his \\"cool slacker\\" personna once again.  (For those of you who have seen his first movie, \\"Bottle Rocket\\", he's playing the same character.) I love Owen, don't get me wrong!  - I'd just like to see him expand his range a little.   Brody wears his hangdog look throughout the movie, and Jason plays the one-dimensional little brother obsessed with the opposite sex.   And face it, the double premise of (spoiler alert) dealing with your father's death and your mother's abandonment is a big downer!  In this piece we are expected to swallow more and more sadness.   Perhaps it is unfair to compare with \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\", but \\"Darjeeling\\" is not up to that standard.  Yes, the train used for shooting is beautiful, and the details and colors are luxurious and gorgeous.  I admire Wes for going to India and using native citizens in this. The music is good, but a good soundtrack cannot carry an entire movie, can it?   It seems somewhere along the line Wes neglected character and plot development, while searching for the perfect camera shot.
B00008G9JN|5.0|After reading every review for Songs From the Wood, I came to the realization that we Tull fans are kindred spirits.  Thanks to each and every one of you for voicing your thoughts, feelings, and opinions about this and other Tull albums...I feel \\"normal\\" amidst your company.    I really cannot say if this is THE BEST Tull album.  Yet, I couldn't effectively make an argument to the contrary.  I know that SFTW is timeless, and like some other reviewers, feel that this element adds a uniqueness to the music.  Of course, the musicianship, song arrangements, and vocals are astonishingly wonderful.    I saw Jethro Tull a couple of months after this album was released and, like another reviewer, still feel that this was the best concert I have ever attended (and I have seen some people...Yes, Kansas, Zeppelin, the Stones, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Rush, the Who...just to name a few of the \\"name\\" acts).  I will never forget how excited I was to actually see and hear these songs reproduced so faithfully, so well, so dramatically, and with such a superb sound quality.  It was truly an experience I could never forget.    Be that as it may, My spirit soars in a similar fashion while listening to Heavy Horses, side one of Thick as a Brick, much of Living in the Past, much of Stormwatch.  And I feel a wonderful, timeless feeling when listening to \\"Back to the Family,\\" \\"Look to the Sun,\\" \\"Fat Man,\\" etc. from Stand Up.  Likewise, \\"Inside,\\" from Benefit, \\"Salamander\\" from Too Old to Rock and Roll, Too Young to Die, \\"Cold Wind From Valhalla\\" from Minstrel in the Gallery, much from Aqualung, \\"Skating Away...\\" from War Child.   I could go on and on, but I think that you fellow Tull fans understand what I am trying to express here.    This is simply great music from a great, largely unique band.  And I have always felt that Ian Anderson is a music legend, a minstrel for the ages.  I highly recommend Songs From the Wood, and (chronologically speaking) every Jethro Tull album beginning with Stand Up and ending with The Broadsword and the Beast.      This review is meant to inspire anyone who has never heard Songs From the Wood to do so.  It will be money well-spent.  I'll let others battle over the supposed \\"pre-eminent\\" Tull album.
0812550706|5.0|There's this kid, and he's sent to a military school in space so he can defeat the aliens who attack the Earth.<br /><br />This book does a lot of great things all at once. It's plot driven AND character driven. The main character (Ender) is in conflict with himself, other people, and with two entire civilizations, while also being caught up in the eternal struggle between good and evil. He feels victimized by his own strategic genius. He longs to be good but fears his only use in life is to be bad. The author's exploration of empathy as a tool to destroy is phenomenal. I've never seen anything like it.<br /><br />There isn't very much description in this book. Sci-fi and fantasy, as genres, tend to be very descriptive, but this isn't Also, the dialogue is more likely to characterize the speakers than advance the plot.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of the few books I would recommend to anyone. I must have bought five copies so far because I keep giving it away.
1582701709|1.0|I got The Secret as a gift, or I would not be reading it.  I struggled to get through it, because so much of it says the same thing over and over.    I have a couple of complaints about this book.  First of all, where is God in this book?  This book is basically telling you that you control your life and you do it yourself.  To believe the things in this book is to disbelieve in God.  It basically tells you that you have power over weather related disasters; God is not mentioned.  Only the \\"Universe\\" has power.    Then there is the subject of fat people.  It says that food does NOT make you fat, your thoughts do.  So, I guess people can gorge all they want on food and not gain weight, as long as they have the right thoughts.  Well, what about all of the obese pets??  I guess they are having \\"fat thoughts\\" too.    I guess people are generally trying to find the easy way to do everything that is not wanted in their lives.  To me, this book gives false hope to people.  If it were true, then send the book to Africa so they can end the starvation in their country.  Let's just send it to all suffering countries and solve their problems!      I, for one, will continue to serve God and realize that He is the Power and man can do nothing on his own.

1847370292|1.0|I have not read the book or seen the full DVD, but I did see the clip on youtube.  It seems unreal to me that people can believe this garbage.  It rings like some cult that implies that slavery is right because one has willed oneself to be a slave.  All the theory does is put the blame on the individual for their life gone wrong, which everyone knows is not the case for most people with undesirable lives.  Does anyone who believes this theory ever question the founder when he says  (along these lines) \\"Is it any suprise that 96% of the wealth in the world is owned by 2% of the populaiton? It's because they know the secret.\\"  Could it not be something else? Like perhaps the wealthy population using its wealth and power to maintain class oppression and an elitism.  And the worst part about this book is that it is starting to be taught in english class rooms in public schools.  If you child attends a school where they read this instead of Shakespeare or Catcher in the Rye, then instantly quit your job and begin teaching your child at home.  (Or you can complain to the school board for degrading your child's education and get the book banned from being taught.  This is perhaps more plausible.)
0307277887|3.0|After reading the first half of the book, I felt that it was going to deserve a 5-star rating. This was due to Lindsay's providing a fresh, surprising, fast-paced writing style and a rather unique main character. However, once I became accustomed to the novelty of his style and the wittiness of the character, I realized the story was too passive for a story about serial killers and not as exciting as I thought it would be. Further, with the exception of Dexter, all of the other characters are not very well-developed nor are they particularly interesting. While I wasn't disappointed in Darkly Dreaming Dexter, it is not a book that I'd urge you to rush out to read.
B00006EXL5|5.0|If you love MCR and good music, you have to have this CD. It's their beginning, how they started off; it's great. I absolutely love this CD and haven't heard anything else like it.  Buy it, you'll love it even if you don't like their later CDs (which i doubt).
0767817478|1.0|This truly is GINO(Godzilla in name only).    Gone is the fear of nuclear holocaust, gone the fear of the unstoppable force of nature known as Gojira(Godzilla). Gone is the giant who is indifferent to the weapons of man. Gone is the terriying atomic nuclear ray.  Replaced is a giant iguana that eats fish and runs away alot. The military is portrayed as morons, too many inconsistencies:  Can't lock on to him because he is cold...HUH? Even slugs give off body heat.  Mayor barking out orders, the mayor would have no say since the city would be under marshall law.  It is pregnant? Godzilla is supposed to be unique.  You did not have that sense of fear or dread and drama, just mindless CGI.  For a good chunk of the film little raptpor ripoffs are running around.  Isn't this a giant monster flick???  Obvious alien and Jurassic Park ripoffs.    People can make fun of the man in suite, this Godzilla looked like Gumby. He looked like playstation graphics in some scenes moved super fast, like it is rushed off the screen. No fluid movement. CGI is hit or miss.  Its gets lost in NY?? In a city of millions?? He burrows???  Acting was hammed up, most of the actors were Simpsons voices. Ay Caramba!    Godzilla had no presense, it was just a scared creature running away alot.  Godzilla v Hedorah was superior to this, least he put up a fight.  If you want a good monster flick that is an edge of your seat movie I strongly recommend getting a copy of Cloverfield when that comes out.  Audrey Timmonds was correct ITS GOJIRA YOU MORONS. This is not Godzilla.
0316010669|2.0|I have heard many good things about this author.  I like the fact that he grew out his hair during the process of writing this book.  It started out really strong and then he lost me in the middle.  Its about the re-discovery of his youth and the rules you learn more than intuition.
B00005M91K|5.0|Baraka is a feast for the eyes and a treat for the soul. It is on one hand beautiful and awe inspiring yet also shocking and horrible. I had the overall feeling as if the director or the person behind the camera was trying to tell me something. Nature is better old ways were best, tribalism to civilised mankind what really have we gained? Except for a life with no spiritual meaning and a day full of mindless busy-work. You may really need to get in the mood for this, it is not lite-fare. Some images may be too shocking for children. The only thing missing is a Blu-Ray version.
020161622X|5.0|The book is a must read for every serious programmer. Authors shares their expertise in software development and the book is filled with a lot of advises and tehnologies to be used in software development process. If you are a pragrammtic programmer or want to become one, the book is a must read. It will confirm what you will already know and bring new things to you. The book can be a learn start point for other technologies and techniques you need to study. Reading the book, I found out about a lot of new things i didn't even know they exist, things that i need to study more.    The reading style is very easy. The book is written in a chatty style, a pleasure to read it.  I 100% recommend this book to everyone who is involved in software development and want to progress in career.
B00006I53S|5.0|I just tried this lens and I was quite impressed with how clear the images came out in very low light.  The image stabilizer (IS) really works well and it allows me to take pictures that look like the suns out when the room has almost no light @ all. I'm only a novice photographer but I do have other zoom lenses that DO NOT have an IS and it is very hard to get clear images in low light settings.
B0000A5A0T|5.0|This is a fantastic album.  I don't own any other Coltrane-led recordings, as my jazz collection is still in its infancy.  I've been collecting mainly Hank Mobley and Freddie Hubbard dates since I've gotten into jazz, as well as some other Blue Note releases.  I actually had purchased this album several years ago, along with Miles Davis's [[ASIN:B000002ADT Kind of Blue]], on a recommendation from a friend.  While I certainly enjoyed it, I don't think I was knowledgeable enough at that time to fully appreciate it.  I'm a little older now, perhaps no wiser, but at least now I have some sort of foundation to stand on.  The supporting cast on this album is exemplary.  Over the past few months, Kenny Drew has become one of my favorite jazz pianists.  He shows off strong chops on \\"I'm Old Fashioned\\" and \\"Locomotion\\".  Curtis Fuller's trombone adds some much needed depth and Lee Morgan provides soulful, expressive trumpet.  And the rhythm section of Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones is simply magnificent.  I always seem to enjoy an album more when Philly Joe is laying down the beats.<br /><br />And the leader?  Jaw-dropping.  I don't own [[ASIN:B000002I4S Giant Steps]], but I've listened to it several times and it's simply mind boggling.  While not as technically dazzling as that recording, Coltrane's work on Blue Train is flawless and emotional.  He reaches for heights other musicians can only dream about, wrapping each moment in a glorious round tone that seems to resonate for days.<br /><br />While Hank Mobley remains my favorite tenor man, there's no denying that Coltrane was the superior musician who broke the boundaries and pushed jazz to another level.  This is an amazing recording made with a top-notch group of musicians, a must have in your music library.  Believe the hype on this one.
0321544080|5.0|Although this isn't really a \\"how-to\\" type of book, I did pick up lots of great little tips and techniques along the way.  I'm not a pro, but am a very serious amateur and have been involved in photography since a very early age... but, I still learned a great deal from this book.  Some of his tips and techniques are repeated many times throughout the book, but that's also good because you find out what things work for him in many different situations.<br /><br />Apart from the education aspect, this was really just a fun book to read!  Lots of great stories and jokes along the way to keep you smiling.  Plenty of really great photos to study as well.<br /><br />The book description is very accurate, so I won't go into the details of what's in the book.  If you are even thinking about picking this up, I'll just say to GO FOR IT!  You won't be disappointed!
B000MXPE7O|5.0|Yes this movie is complex.  Yes it's slowly paced.  But that combination, along with some superb acting and a great story is what makes it so gripping.    If you don't like having to pay close attention to a movie to enjoy it, you won't enjoy this.  However, if you want a scintillating story that continually moves, builds and shapes to a dramatic final conclusion, then you'll greatly enjoy this.    This is a truly fascinating story, whether true or not.
0321344758|4.0|I was in the middle of redesigning one of my own web sites, and had a coupon to redeem for Amazon, so I picked up this book.  Steve does a great job with this book.  Very well written, concise, and to the point.  For someone like me, who is an amateur web designer (just doing several sites of my own), this was just what I needed to get me thinking about how usable my site is, and how people really use web sites.<br /><br />There are no specific coding examples, or HTML, or CSS, or anything like that.  It's not meant to be a book to teach you how to actually build the web site with HTML or CSS.  Instead, it is more of a higher level, overall picture, type of thing.  That's just what I wanted, and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />It made me go back and rethink how I was laying out some things on my web site, and how I always include WAY too much text.  I'll be using a lot of the ideas in this book to eventually go back and rework all of my sites!
B0011FDVKE|5.0|Listening to Boston's folk radio station (WUMB) is the place where I can hear the gamut of new and old musicians. I must say I was pleasantly surprised after hearing 'Something to Me.' So surprised that I bought this new cd yesterday, the day of it's release. I definitely recommend this cd/artist to anyone who enjoys Emmylou Harris, Nanci Griffith or Patty Griffin. The melodies are great and the lyrics are poetic and accessible. I'm very happy to have found a new artist to follow. Now all I need to do is listen to her whole catalog.     Thanks Tift! Hope to see you live when you come to the Northeast.
B00005PJ6M|3.0|Time travel's most unlikely heroes are at it again. This time the romp isn't as fun as their first movie. You would think with the same writing team from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure some of the old magic would still be there. Alas it wasn't. It's not that Bogus Journey wasn't funny or enjoyable enough to watch, but at the same time it's not in the same league as its predecessor on many levels.     First off the future setting was off from before. The futuristic costumes in this movie took a massive turn for the worse compared to the last one (can you say day-glow foam suits?). Sets weren't as bad, but you can notice a change. The villain also seemed out of place in this film, but I guess he keeps the plot moving. Granted the evil Bill and Ted robots and their blatant badness were amusing... to a point. Then it gets tired and repetitive. The chemistry between Bill and Ted themselves didn't seem as strong as the first movie either. Maybe it's just the script that's making it seem strained     Instead of traveling through time they are going through Heaven, Hell, Purgatory (sorta) and plain old San Dimas. A few cameos from those historical characters in the last movie, Socrates or Abe Lincoln, would have fit perfectly in the story. But that never happens. That interaction with a couple of teens from the valley and historical icons is what made the first movie so great. You don't get the same kind of interaction this time around. The only exception, and a good one I might add, is their relationship with the Grim Reaper. William Sadler literally steals the show with a fantastically funny performance through and through.     I might as well hit my biggest gripe, which happens at the end of the movie. Essentially all that talk from the last movie about, \\"no matter what you do your current clock is always ticking\\" was pretty much thrown out the window in place of a quick fix. Also they wasted some good talent with George Carlin, who does pretty much nothing in the movie but fulfill an immensely stupid plot twist... thus again the writers take an easy way out of the plot.     I know I have been slamming this movie hard, but I will admit it's still fun to watch once you get past the crap. The scenes with the Grim Reaper are alone worth seeing the movie. I guess all this stuff I said is to just warn you not to expect too much from Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey. It's good for a few laughs, but don't expect greatness... or very goodness at that.
B000GNOM78|5.0|This HD DVD looks so much better then the standard DVD version it's pretty impressive. Most of the movie is remastered in HD, but there are certain shots that look quite blurry. There are only a few blurry shots though. When the police drive up to hassle Jim Kelly I noticed a very blurry shot, but it was brief.     Most of the movie is outstanding. Some of the close ups showed the pores in the skin of the actors. The detail of the good shots is outstanding. More than half of this movie looks as good as HD cable. I gave it five stars because it's from the early 1970s and I didn't expect to get a cutting-edge image throughout the entire film.
630460288X|4.0|There is normally a glut of action oriented science fiction movies that come out each summer and it's hard to pick out the good ones from the bad ones. At times I can be as eager as the next guy to just have a fun popcorn movie that doesn't rely on any deep storytelling, but just good old high flying action. Demolition Man, while not deep, still pulls off some detailed storytelling while still keeping that mindless mayhem most action junkies look for. That being said Demolition Man isn't exactly top gun material either, but it is a worthwhile romp into an interesting (if not completely believable) future.     The premise alone is enough to pique my interest. It's a combination fish-out-of-water story and action cop flick. Lets talk about the former since that's where the story comes from. The beauty of fish-out-of-water scripts is seeing the reactions of the fish in question and how they cope with the new world they are in. This movie has a lot of fun with that concept without getting too over the top. It's really entertaining seeing Stallone trying to figure out stuff (especially the three shells incident). The future society is almost campy in how it's done, but it's very polished camp. It is the kind of camp that doesn't come off as camp. Though technically speaking the society in the movie is virtually impossible the way they show it you still can't help but enjoy all the little situations that happen within it.     The characters are really polished... save one. But lets talk about the polished ones first. You have some really talented actors here portraying their characters perfectly. From the starring cast to the supporting cast you get a wonderful ensemble that fits into their respective roles like a glove... save one. That one character Simon Phoenix, which feels way too cartoonish and aloof to fit in as well as the other characters in the movie. Don't get me wrong. Wesley Snipes did a superb job acting the role. It's just the role itself could have used some tweaking. With this kind of tight acting I will have to give props to Brambilla for some excellent directing here. The city design is equally polishes, using just enough future stuff to make it believable. The special effects are good, but keep in mind this being an action movie the explosions do get over the top. The fight scenes are nicely choreographed as well, showing some prowess on Snipes' part. In the end the production values are definitely worthy of high status.     Demolition Man looks a lot like a mindless action movie, and it actually is. Only this one has a little more brains in it than most. It knows how to have fun with its role. If you love action sci-fi with a good dose of comedy then you found your match here. If you like some depth to your storyline as well as action then you too found something here. While it's not high grade science fiction by any means Demolition Man is still a worthwhile jaunt if you crave a lighter diet of sci-fi.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Billy Wilder's career as a writer-director reads like a Best Films list: Ninotchka (1939), Arise My Love (1940), Ball Of Fire (1941), The Major And The Minor (1942), Five Graves To Cairo (1943), Double Indemnity (1944), The Lost Weekend (1945), The Bishop's Wife (1947), A Foreign Affair (1948), Sunset Boulevard (1950), Ace In The Hole (1951), Stalag 17 (1953), Sabrina (1954), The Seven Year Itch (1955), Witness For The Prosecution (1957), Some Like It Hot (1959), The Apartment (1960), One, Two, Three (1961) and The Fortune Cookie (1966), among others.<br /><br />He was nominated for 21 Academy Awards, he won 7 (including the prestigious Irving G Thalberg Memorial Award in 1988), and one of those Oscars was for the screenplay of Sunset Boulevard. Sunset Boulevard is considered by many to be his finest work, and one of the great, great films of Hollywood. It is also the classic example of Film Noir, a style of film that was popular in the late 40's and early 50's, known for its edginess, among other things. Because it examines the underbelly of Hollywood at the time, it is a film buff's delight.<br /><br />It is the story of a failing young Hollywood screenwriter named Joe Gillis, who inadvertently finds himself at the dilapidated house of a washed-up silent movie star, Norma Desmond. She talks him into becoming the editor of her \\"comeback\\" script; but he gets so comfortable with the lush lifestyle she offers, that he agrees to much more than that. It turns into a weird, one-sided, Spring-Autumn romance - codependency gone wild. Joe is trapped and sees no easy way out because he doesn't want to go back to the penniless existence he had before. Then, a young female writer comes along that needs his help. In their secret working relationship, and in her fresh innocence, he rediscovers what he has lost. But has he got the courage to leave Norma?<br /><br />William Holden is his best-looking, and perfect as Joe Gillis, whose cynical humor pervades the film, and who also acts as its narrator. But Holden was not Wilder's first choice. The director wanted Montgomery Clift, which would have given the film a whole different flavor. But, luckily, Clift turned it down. The actor playing Joe Gillis needed to be an all-American type that seemingly has been corrupted by the Hollywood system, and no one could have filled that role better than Holden. At the time, the athletic actor's career was somewhat on the wane. But his performance in this film, along with subsequent Billy Wilder films - Stalag 17 (1953) and Sabrina (1954) - established him as a top performer and star, who would go on to make Executive Suite (1954), The Country Girl (1954), Love Is A Many-Splendored Thing (1955), Picnic (1955), The Bridge On The River Kwai (1957), The Wild Bunch (1969) and Network (1976), among others. He was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for Sunset Boulevard and Network, and won for Stalag 17.<br /><br />Gloria Swanson, who was a big star in the Silent days, but hadn't had a role to speak of since then, was also not a first choice for Wilder - but what would Sunset Boulevard be without her. She was perfect as the threateningly creepy, self-obsessed and self-deluded Norma Desmond. Amazingly, Swanson's own career mirrored that of the tarnished star's. It ended, partly as a result of her association with one of the other actors in Sunset Boulevard - Eric von Stroheim, who plays her butler, Max. Von Stroheim - who, like Max, had once been a director - is best known for directing one of the longest films ever made. At four hours long, Greed (1924) was, unsurprisingly, a box-office disaster. After that, he directed Swanson in the film that became for both of them something of a swan song - Queen Kelly (1929). Interestingly, the film appears in Sunset Boulevard as the movie that Norma and Joe are watching when she stands up, backlit by the projector, and vows to make a comeback, which she calls a \\"return.\\"<br /><br />Rounding out the cast is Nancy Olson asyoung writer Betty Schaefer, who also becomes the love-interest for Gillis. Her fresh, innocent, upbeat character is the only one that doesn't show Hollywood in a bad light. The only other character that could possibly be said of is Cecil B. DeMille, who plays himself. Having done many previous films together, Norma is hoping he will direct her \\"return.\\" Their meeting on the Paramount lot is a poignant, bitter-sweet reunion, and an indication of just how deluded Norma has become, and how cruel Hollywood can be to the stars they have cast aside. There are other famous people who play themselves: gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, along with silent stars Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and HB Warner. All three of these silent stars went on to very lucrative careers in sound pictures - hardly the has-beens they plays in Sunset Boulevard.<br /><br />The opening of Sunset Boulevard is probably the most famous in film history: a body floating face down in a pool, shot from below, acts as the narrator the story. This was an extremely difficult shot, as the necessary underwater cameras had not yet been invented, requiring that it be shot instead using a mirror. It is powerful. All the camerawork in this film is outstanding. But what is most remarkable is the script, by Billy Wilder. This is one of the few films ever shot that does not depart from the script, with one exception: the opening scene originally takes place in a morgue, with the dead bodies mentally discussing Gillis' death. While it worked in the script, it didn't work on film. And once it was showed to an test audience - with inappropriately hilarious response - it was changed. Other than that, the script was perfect.<br /><br />Sunset Boulevard is full of juicy lines, but probably the most famous is, \\"I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.\\" Norma utters this at the end of the film, having just descended her staircase - filled with reporters, photographers and newsreel cameramen - as she is being taken off to jail for shooting Gillis. Another famous line is Norma's response to Joe when he first meets her and says, \\"You're Norma Desmond - you used to be big.\\" She quips, \\"I am big. It's the pictures that got small.\\"<br /><br />Sunset Boulevard has held up remarkably well through the years. It is still just as powerful as it was when it opened in 1950 to respectable but not overly enthusiastic audiences. (Perhaps it was a bit too cynical for 1950. Louis B. Meyer, on the other hand, is said to have gone berserk because of its negative but honest portrayal of Hollywood.)

B00011CZQU|3.0|Let me make one thing clear: This movie has killer action! I will not deny that and if it weren't for other aspects of the movie it would have gotten a higher rating just for the action. Unfortunately all the bad stuff cancels out the good stuff for me.     There are some things I just can't forgive and one is plain stupidity and lack of continuity. The people in this movie are dumb as dirt. At the beginning of Blade we have him fighting off vampires wearing these neat \\"day suits\\" that protect them from UV light. Funny thing is they conveniently forget they have these useful garments when they have to hunt during the day. Talk about stupid. Not only that, it is established that the big bad hybrid vampires that are the main focus of Blade 2 can only be killed by UV light, yet the idiots still pack a ton of firepower instead of a mess of flashlights. Man... brainless testosterone sure does flow thick in that movie. Another thing I felt was overkill was Blade's new chemical formula he laces all of his weapons and bullets with (well the bullets are packed with it... not laced) and the fact that a single drop of this stuff is apparently enough to BBQ a vampire's entire body. Just seems like they are pushing the envelope here.        The plot is somewhat derivative and only gives Blade a reason to kill things. Granted Blade came from a Marvel comic book and the movie does attempt to stick with a comic book styled story, but come on! Give us some depth here! There was a painfully predictable love interest that doesn't do much for the movie at all. There are also a few \\"surprise\\" plot twists that are also utterly predictable and bring nothing to the table. And as much as I like Wesley Snipes and as much I like what he brings to the character, the perpetual \\"cool pose\\" theme gets old. Just once I would like to see Blade tie his shoe or even just stand still in a non-cool way. Quick Blade! While you answer the phone. Strike a pose!!    Still in all of the story content bashing I make this movie has some of the greatest action scenes ever. The fighting is intense and the choreography is stylish without being campy. I really mean it. The action in Blade 2 is awesome. The special effects are well done for the most part and little things like the lighting, camera angles and sound are also done well. In other words the action scenes and production values are top notch... except for the soundtrack.  The soundtrack is nice but it felt forced fed. It seems every time you're in a club and someone turns away for a minute a new song is on (conveniently being a song from the Blade 2 Soundtrack). One scene in this movie seems to pack at least five songs within ten minutes.      If you're into nothing but action, action, and ACTION then Blade 2 is just the movie for you. If you like both action and good story telling then be forewarned; you will have to weigh great action with lame plot and judge for yourself. Of course if you are all about content and care little for action you might as well save your money and wait until it comes on cable or broadcast TV. Blade 2 is a great action film and nothing more.
6301966562|5.0|This is the best romantic comedy of the 1980s hands down.  With that said...    Why isn't this baby on DVD yet?  Come on people, it's 2008!    If we can have movies like Cobra and Walker, Texas Ranger on DVD, why can't we have Electric Dreams?  Do you know how many people would buy Electric Dreams on DVD?     If nothing else, it's good business, no?
B00004Y87O|4.0|Only goes to show you Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson aren't the early 80's only people who can portray a wicked-cool tough guy. Escape from New York is John Carpenter's post apocalyptic answer to those lone wolf anti-heroes we used to see in the classic westerns. Though the movie is rough around it's edges I see this one as one of Carpenter's better movies.     Stick an anti-establishment ex-military dude, load him up with weapons and drop him in a city controlled by roving gangs of convicts. That's Escape from New York in a nutshell. What makes it work? The characters. What makes the characters work? The actors. You get a nice slice of star power in this movie with the likes of Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasance, Adrienne Barbeau and a slew of others. Put them together and you have some pretty sweet performances. Even Isaac Hayes (Chef of South Park) plays a surprisingly interesting role as the Duke of New York. Considering he was a popular singer back then and not an actor I'm impressed. Of course Kurt Russell owns the screen as Snake Plissken. Thanks for Russel's portrayal that name will go down in sci-fi history.     Special effects aren't much to speak of. Most of the movie is based on set design of a ruined New York City. Not exactly high budget and it shows. The special effects that are on the movie are in the beginning and are quite impressive in a very subtle way. First off you have the model work that really brings the trashed city to life. Also there are some images they put on a display screen that have an impressive and very convincing three-dimensional effect you wouldn't expect by first looking at it. Although it's brief, it's neat enough to be worth noting.     Action there is plenty. You get running gun fights, arena death matches, exploding land mines, and a race against the clock. Kind of like a street gang movie with more props. They do get into that tired cliché of killing off as many good guys as you can so the hero can be left alone. Such a shame when considering alternatives to that predictable formula. Plissken is a relatively one dimensional character, but in a way that's the beauty of him. Just keep in mind you won't see much character growth in him.     Escape from New York could be called your standard post apocalyptic/gang war type movie, only this is the one that set that standard in the first place. Many people consider it a classic and I tend to agree. It's an interesting look into that harsh cyberpunk future without all the gadgets and tech in the way. It's not a classic in the sense of the greatest of the great, but it is a landmark in science fiction heritage and should be respected as such.
B000I0QLZU|5.0|the movie is a new classic. it has all the eliments of a great blockbuster. action, guns, tech gadgets. and a good and evilcombined and a map to a treasure at the end of the movie. it's 007 mixed with indiana jones, but one obvious thing a tough aluring lara croft as the main character... a must for the blu-ray collection!!!!!
B0001IN07Q|5.0|This man is so vibrant, has such a warm, rich, full voice, is so innovative and fun that you can't resist him.  He excels at old standards but also spans several decades with some of the the songs he does and now has three original songs too.  I would also recommend his CD/DVD \\"Caught in The Act\\" and CD \\"Michael Buble'\\"    Enjoy, I have been!!!
B0011NVC9I|2.0|This is a difficult movie to review, mainly because I hated it, and I bought it, and I'll probably watch it many times.  As you can see, I feel extremely conflicted about it.    The biggest problem for me is that I loved the poem, it's one of my personal favorite works of literature, but Robert Zemeckis hated it (as you'll hear him say if you watch the special features).  He really had no business making a movie about Beowulf.  The essence of the original poem is the heroism of Beowulf and others, a heroism they made sure to destroy in this version.  Several characters from the poem that I found inspiring have been reduced to bragging liars, including Beowulf himself.  In fact, there is not a single hero you can really respect and look up to in the entire movie, since they make sure to ruin them all by the very end.  I was literally disgusted.    But on the other hand...  I *can* appreciate a fun action flick.    I love fantasy movies, and as far as fantasy movies go this one is quite a lot of fun.  The animation didn't bother me, apart from some wooden movement here and there it looks very good.  All animation has its quirks you have to accept, and this movie is no exception.  I personally loved the look of things, the lighting and textures are excellent.  The action is fun and original.  Overall it's just a fun movie to watch, if you can get over your stomach turning.    My feelings about this movie are similar to my feelings about the movie [[ASIN:0783241895 Conan the Barbarian]].  I loved the original Conan stories, but John Milius just butchered the character, turning him into a muscle-headed pansy.  In spite of that it makes a great fantasy movie, just not a good Conan movie.  In the case of Beowulf it's a fun and exciting fantasy movie, but it's a horrible Beowulf movie.  If you don't watch it expecting Beowulf, if you're expecting flashy CGI and cheap action with shallow characters who can fight, but little else, you'll probably enjoy it.  I did, for what that's worth.    The one thing now that really kills me is that now that there has been a Beowulf movie from Hollywood, they won't want to make a *really* good one.  Maybe part of the reason I'm willing to accept the faults is because I love Beowulf and don't expect Hollywood to produce anything better any time soon.  It's sad, but true.    If you are interested in the Beowulf legend (or over the age of 13), I suggest these alternatives:    [[ASIN:B000GIXEIG Beowulf & Grendel]] - also creatively adapted but with much more respect for the original.    [[ASIN:6305692688 The 13th Warrior]] - not without its faults, but it's an interesting take on the legend.  Based on the excellent Beowulf-inspired novel, [[ASIN:0060891564 Eaters of the Dead]], by Michael Crichton.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Ben Affleck's directorial debut is a winner on almost every level. This taut, suspenseful tale of police corruption and bad decisions is always exciting, and the acting by all is excellent, including Casey Affleck, Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, Amy Madigan, Oscar-nominated Amy Ryan, and an actress I'm not familiar with, Michelle Monaghan. Plot twists and turns, and a surprise ending, make this one of the best cop/detective movies I've seen in a very long time. My only problem was with the sound recording which made Aaron Stockard's fine screenplay hard to understand. Being a plot-driven narrative, this created a bit of an issue. The DVD has some fine extras. \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is highly recommended.
B000001EIA|5.0|This is among the great KISS albums.<br />Alive! is legendary, but Unplugged is a masterpiece.<br />The album shows the true integrity of KISS and that their songs hold up as classic rock n' roll.<br />The main highlights are \\"Comin' Home\\", \\"I Still Love You\\", \\"2,000 Man\\", \\"Beth\\" and \\"Nothin' To Lose\\".<br />Bruce Kulick does a great job taking Ace's electric guitar solos and translating them to work accoutically.<br />The set list was so diverse for this show, it really is a great listen all around.<br />I have also found this to be a great jumping off point for introducing people to KISS who might have an aversion to \\"guys that wear make-up\\" or people who say \\"they're great performers, but the music is weak\\".<br />I gave a copy to my best friend who thinks Springsteen is God and he now he's added the four-who-are-one to his list of rock deities.<br />So if you haven't already, buy this album.  Then buy Kisstory Vol. 3 for a few extras and to see the unplugged action come Alive!.

0143038419|1.0|I wanted to shake the author and tell her to grow up.  I was so annoyed by her and her whining while reading this book that I almost didn't finish it.  Had it not been a selection for a book club, I would never have spent the time on it.  She was so self-centered that I could not handle it.
0316776963|3.0|I read so many great reviews for this book, and I love his sister, Amy Sedaris, so I thought... why not? I'll try it. I am usually one to love autobiographical stories, but I was slightly surprised when I read this book. I will say I enjoyed reading through it, but there were certain situations he was in (a story about public transportation in France where an American couple is making fun of David and his boyfriend... thinking that because they are in France, they are the only ones who speak English... I loved the scenario, but I was rooting for David to make a witty comeback to the couple... and he never did. Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed.) My favorite stories are about him teaching an English class and requiring students to watch soap operas... oh! and also the few that are about David learning French-hilarious!  This book is very quirky. I liked it, I wish I loved it because the writing is very fun to read, but some of the short stories needed a little \\"umph\\" to 'em. If you enjoy reading short vignettes that are sometimes excruciating awkward... this is definitely the book for you. I would not say it was \\"laugh out loud\\" funny (and there are many books that are just that), but it was worth the time reading.

0345479092|5.0|I used this book with my first child, and it was incredibly helpful.  I've found that so many baby advice books are either very strict 'ferber'-type books that advocate the 'cry-it-out' method, or the way too 'on-demand' or 'attachment' oriented and advocate that the baby rules the world.  Neither end of the spectrum was right for me, and The Baby Whisperer is very well balanced.  Her methods are both gentle and structured.  When I had my second child I immediately referred to this book as a refresher, and again found it so helpful.<br /><br />On a personal note, the methods/ideas I found most useful from this book are E.A.S.Y (the daily pattern the author recommends - Eat, Active/Awake, Sleep, You), and learning to read the signals your baby so readily gives off.  All you have to do is slow down long enough to listen to what your baby is telling you.<br /><br />Side note: I see that the recommended tags for this book include a lot of emphasis on sleeping and sleeping through the night.  I agree that this book has some great advice in that area, but it is so much more!  If you just slow down and \\"listen\\" to your baby, the sleeping part will come quite easily.  That is where this author's true strength lies.<br /><br />I have referred to this book time and time again, and always recommend it to my friends with new babies - especially first-time parents.
B000TGCR38|5.0|This movie was entertaining from begining to end. Wonderful suspense and intrigue. I couldn't help but think that there must have been thousands of personal dramas like this one going on during WWII. I loved it. It's definately not a slick Hollywood production, but a great little movie.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|Honestly, before I bought this CD, I knew just the name of Loreena McKennitt, not her music .. Just by first hearing I falled in love to her musical style, her music and charisma ... This Lady sings and she knows, what she had to do, to tell us a magical stories about magical worlds. And the sound is just perfect, like a studio quality (it's a live recording). Magical mystery tour through the world with Lady Loreena ... and you can buy the tickets ... :-)
B0010ZR160|5.0|When I first started hearing the praise for this movie shortly before its release to theaters in 2007, I found myself becoming very interested in seeing it. Critics were praising the excellent performances from the entire cast, the gripping storytelling, and most surprising of all, they were praising Ben Affleck, not for his acting ability but for his directorial debut with this supposedly mesmerizing, intense, and all too true-to-life film titled \\"Gone Baby Gone\\". So, when it arrived to DVD I just had to see for myself if Ben's directing was as good as some of his better acting days in films such as \\"Good Will Hunting\\" and \\"Hollywoodland\\", or if it was just another artsy-type of movie that generally only critics like but most moviegoers could care less about.    \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" begins when a young girl is kidnapped, and two private detectives (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) are brought on board by the victim's family to help solve the crime. As the mystery surrounding the girl's disappearance begins to unfold, the secrets that are unearthed will change the lives of virtually every single person involved with the case. With time working against them, these two detectives must risk everything to do what's right in the midst of a case where they have no idea who to trust and nothing is at all what it seems.    Well, let me say that after viewing \\"Gone Baby Gone\\", Ben Affleck should have no worries about landing any future directing jobs, because he showed that he has a steady-hand when it comes to helming a film, and the subject matter is as serious as it gets both in life and in cinema, yet Ben's focus never seems to waiver one second in the narrative of the picture. Tremendous kudos must go to Ben Affleck for tackling this challenging film, and for showing all the critics that he is truly a talent to be respected in his field.    The story for \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane (author of \\"Mystic River\\"), and was adapted for the screen by Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard. The script is incredibly well-written, and is packed full of so many twists and turns that if you lose focus for one minute you'll be lost as to what is exactly going on in the film. That is how fast the playing field seems to change in this movie. Just when you think you've got the movie figured out, and you know exactly what occurred and who was responsible, think again because the rug gets yanked out from beneath you and once more you are left puzzled, but never to the point of confusion or disbelief. Every twist in this story is completely plausible, never once calling upon the audience to suspend their disbelief for even a second. The story is superbly crafted and is a testament to the writers' abilities to include so many shifts in the story, and yet they never lose focus or contradict themselves. Brilliant work on the part of everyone involved in the writing process for this film, from the novel to the screenplay everyone deserves great credit for this piece.    The actors were all extremely talented individuals and each rose to the task at hand of presenting such heavy subject matter with the proper respect it deserves. Casey Affleck (\\"Ocean's Thirteen\\") shows that he has the acting talent to handle the leading man role, and also finds himself for the first time in his career being able to step out from his older brother Ben's shadow and establish himself on his own merits. Granted Ben directed Casey in this film, but even the best director's can't get such a gripping performance out of an actor if he or she is not up to the challenge, and clearly Casey is. The supporting cast led by Morgan Freeman (\\"Se7en\\"), Ed Harris (\\"A History of Violence\\"), and Michelle Monaghan (\\"Mission: Impossible 3\\") are just as superb as their lead actor, and each gave such earnest performances that all should have been Oscar worthy, but unfortunately most of them weren't. The only member of the cast to be nominated for an Oscar was actress Amy Ryan (\\"Dan in Real Life\\"), who portrayed the young girl's mother in the film. Amy's performance was so incredibly realistic as a woman whose daughter is kidnapped, yet due to her drug-filled life she can't seem to completely fathom just what has exactly happened at first. However, once she does her heartbreaking realization that her life may have led to this unfortunate circumstance is so overwhelming that you feel so much sympathy for her instantly, regardless of what you'd seen of her earlier in the film, and her vows to clean up seem so earnest and heartfelt that you desperately want to believe in her. Yet in the back of your mind you wonder that if the daughter is brought back to her, the likelihood of her mother actually changing her life, and walking the straight and narrow is slim to none. Even if that is the case, and the mother never changes, you still want the daughter to be returned safely in the end, but you do stop to think that maybe the daughter would be better off with someone else raising her rather than her own mother, who never seemed to care that much about her before. It is quandaries such as this that makes \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" such an interesting, and sometimes difficult movie to watch.    With outstanding performances, gripping drama, and solid directing from first time director Ben Affleck, \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is one of the most intense dramas I have watched in awhile. If you are looking for a movie that will keep you interested from start to finish, but will also leave you pondering the various questions it poses long after the credits have finished rolling, then \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is a film you must see.    \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is rated R for violence and language.

B0004Z33EQ|5.0|Sometimes in the world of cinema it actually pays to follow the studio's instincts, or at least those of the creative forces behind a film. In the case of the `Rambo' franchise, the instincts of those involved focused on a decision of whether or not to ignore/omit certain aspects to the film's storyline even though it originated from the source material. This decision to make changes to the story, though questioned by some, was a very wise and extremely lucrative one for the series, as it has gone on to be one of the most successful action franchises in history and made the title character into one of America's beloved action heroes. Had those involved in the first film chosen to go with the original ending in the script, and the novel on which the film was based upon, then in the final moments of the movie the character of John Rambo would have committed suicide rather than having Col. Trautman bring him in safely to custody. If that downer, though probably more realistic, ending to the movie had stayed in the film (it was actually filmed, but was removed after test audiences felt it was too depressing), then Rambo would have never gone on to be featured in three more sequels, Sylvester Stallone would be stuck with having Rocky Balboa as the only signature role of his career (though there are worse fates for an actor), and America would have never been given the chance to make John Rambo into the hero and pop culture icon that he is today. As a side note, actor Kirk Douglas was originally cast to play Col. Trautman in \\"First Blood\\" but dropped out of the role when he learned of the possible changing of the ending, he wanted the film to remain as true to the book as possible right down to the suicide of John Rambo. Fortunately, all of that didn't happen and due to the great success of \\"First Blood\\" the prospect of a sequel was soon made into a reality when director George P. Cosmatos (\\"Tombstone\\"), along with stars Sylvester Stallone (\\"First Blood\\" and the `Rocky' franchise) and Richard Crenna (\\"First Blood\\") brought the highly anticipated, action-packed follow-up \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2\\" to the big screen.    \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2\\" takes place some time after the events of the original film, and John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is serving out his prison sentence in peace. However, when Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives with a top-secret proposal from the U.S. government that would grant Rambo an early parole, just so long as he does what they are asking of him, Rambo's peaceful existence comes to a rather abrupt end. Per the government's orders, the only way Rambo can gain this early parole is for him to agree to return to Vietnam in search of American POW's left over from the war. With freedom in his grasp, and the possibility of freeing some of his brothers-in-arms, Rambo will stop at nothing to find his fellow American's trapped behind enemy lines, and God be with anyone that gets in his way.    The original film, \\"First Blood\\" was an extremely fast-paced, intense survivalist adventure that also served as an interesting study on the treatment of war veteran's by society. For the sequel, \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2\\" the story's focus is shifted somewhat away from the fractured psyche of John Rambo and his mistreatment by U.S. citizen's from his time spent serving in Vietnam, and more onto Rambo's attempts to find and rescue as many of his fellow soldiers as possible. Some critics complained that those responsible for \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2\\" made a mistake in eliminating the heavier story elements and replacing them with even more action than what was contained in the original film. I for one disagree with this sentiment; yes there is a lesser amount of time spent dwelling on the deeper issues of the title character, but audiences would no doubt grow tired of the series if the focus never moved on beyond Rambo's struggle to come to grips with himself and the world around him. The choice to ratchet up the action within the film was a good decision for the filmmakers to make, after all this is an action film (as was the first one), and what would an action film be without plenty of violence, explosions, and weapons galore? Now, you might say well it sounds like the critics complaints may be accurate and that this franchise had become just another action franchise, just with a much more recognizable character as the hero, but other than that it's no different. Well, my response to that is this, yes there's plenty of action all throughout the film, but the heavy elements of the original film are still intact and receive numerous references over the course of the movie. As for the rest of the film's story, there are plenty of interesting plot points and character developing moments to drive the story forward, without needing to rely solely on the action to keep things moving along.    The characters for the film were brought to life by an extremely talented group of actors, comprised primarily of character actors, led by stars Sylvester Stallone and Richard Crenna, both reprising their roles from the original film. I enjoyed seeing Rambo tackle a different kind of villain than the one he had faced in the original movie, the original film featured villains that weren't actually evil people, they were just ordinary, everyday citizens that were too blinded by their prejudices and fear of what they don't understand, that they went too far to protect their way of life. In this film, the villains are much darker and more evil, as we are shown over the course of Rambo's mission in Vietnam to save POW's; however, the villains weren't only those holding our soldiers prisoner, there were also some wolves hiding in sheep's clothing so to speak, that were supposedly working alongside Rambo during his mission. It was this aspect of duplicity within some of the characters that made for numerous interesting sequences throughout the film, serving to create some juicy drama and tension amongthe characters giving the film a sense of unpredictability, and served as a key reason for why this franchise still remains a cut above the rest of its genre.    For those nay-sayers that want to believe that \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2\\" was the initial signs that the franchise was losing its focus and becoming just another run-of-the-mill action series, I say give the film another look. There is plenty of drama, character development, and plot twists to keep the story moving during the times when Rambo isn't killing someone or blowing something up on screen. Is this sequel as deep as the original film? No, but it isn't shallow by any means either and still contains many of the deep issues that were introduced in \\"First Blood\\" without focusing on them completely so as to not seem like a rehash of the first movie. \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2\\" is an extremely exciting, fast-paced, action thrill ride that serves as a fitting sequel to the original film that introduced America to the hero that is John Rambo.    \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B00081U6EG|5.0|I bought this DVD as a Srat player since 1959, and was amazed at the collection of artists and their skill with the Srat.    Sure, ther were some Srat players who were not there, but i was impressed by several players that i was totally unaware of.    How can you not love the great Albert Lee? He absolutely blew me away with Country Boy.    I listened to Hank Marvin on radio Luxumberg while living in Germany and he showed us all how the Strat can produce great sounds for instrumentals that inspired the US Ventures. (The Ventures originally made their reputation as Fender players and junped ship to Mosrite) Having Hank's son Ben on the stage with his obvious pleasure in backing dad was a special treat.    Theresa Anderson has been dissed by many reviewers, but she gives a spirited delivery and shows how younger musicians naturally gravitate to the Strat.    What can we say about Mike Rutherford and Paul Carrick? They did three great songs with true enthusiasim and a lot of heart. Phil Palmer showed his incredible talent at playing note-for-note covers of Hendrix, Clapton and Harrison. He was always smiling and surely enjoyed being on stage.    Gary Moore (along with David Gilmour) was the star of the show. He covered Hendrix better than Hendrix - and i am an original Hendrix fan. What a great demonstration of the sonic range of the Strat! He gave his all and clearly enjoyed every second.    I agree with others that Jamie Cullum, despite his good work, does not belong on a Strat tribute since he has no guitars! I just skip his song.I appreciate his support of the concert in any cased.    Amy Winehouse was great because of the excellent guitar work during her delivery of Stronger Than Me.    I now have a newfound appreciation of Paul Rodgers vocal range. Having his kids on stage was a little strange, but they did an entertaining job and again showed how the younger folk gravitate to the Fender for its incredible versatility.    For me the highlight of the concert was David Gilmour and Gary Moore. David did maybe his best ever renditions of three Pink Floyd classics. Seeing him at 59 and remembering him at 30 gives me chill bumps. I just hope he continues to make more music as he is clearly one of the most expressive Fender players of all time. I listen to his three-song set at least once a day.    Some have critisized Ron Wood, but lets remember that he is known not for his vocals but for his total domination of the Fender Strat. He really is the model for guitar players living the dream.    You may have different favorites on this DVD, but i believe this is a must have for any serious Strat lover or guitar fan. We can find other sources for the Start greats who were not there.
B0004Z33F0|4.0|With two successful entries into the `Rambo' franchise, it was hardly surprising that fan and studio anticipation would be high for any upcoming sequel that would make its way to theaters nationwide. So, six years after the character's first appearance on the big screen that led to him becoming one of America's iconic action heroes, Sylvester Stallone returned once again to throw John Rambo back into action with \\"Rambo 3\\". But, how easy would it be for Stallone and company to at least equal if not surpass the quality of the first two films in the franchise, \\"First Blood\\" and \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2\\"? The answer would be, not too easy at all, but the creative forces behind this franchise were determined to try their best to make the audiences proud.    \\"Rambo 3\\" begins with John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) living out his days free from prison walls, and existing in peace while working at a monastery. When Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives to entice Rambo to assist him in aiding the people of Afghanistan against the invading forces of Russia, Rambo's peaceful existence seems once again destined to be short-lived. However, Rambo rejects Trautman's plea for help, with the claim that his war is over. But it seems that fate has a different destiny in mind for Rambo, when word arrives that Trautman and his team have been captured by the Russians, Rambo finds himself being thrust back into a war that he didn't ask for. Knowing that Trautman would never leave him behind, Rambo does the only things he can think to do, locate the enemy, eliminate the enemy, and rescue his friend no matter the cost.    When \\"Rambo 3\\" came out the anticipation surrounding the film was understandably high; however, upon release many people, both critics and fans alike, felt let down by this entry into the series. The criticisms were relatively uniform in nature, most were related to a seeming lack of content and story to propel the movie onward, and that \\"Rambo 3\\" opted for an over-reliance on big explosions and action sequences to keep the audience distracted from the paper-thin plot. I suppose I can see the critic's point of view on this movie, the story did seem a bit weaker than the previous two installments; however, I don't believe that the story was so lacking that it relied solely on the action to keep things moving along as many modern action flicks seem to do. The story for \\"Rambo 3\\" wasn't as deep as the previous two films, in fact it didn't seem to touch on Rambo's psychological issues whatsoever, but by the third film it was probably time to move completely past those plot points anyhow. Even with the psychological issues being left out of the film, the overall plot to the movie was very interesting and socially relevant, since the film was being made, and was even set during the late 1980's, the content was appropriate due to the United States assisting the people of Afghanistan against the invading forces of Russia (little did we know that our assistance would backfire on us later on in September 2001). So, to all those that criticized \\"Rambo 3\\" for a lack of content, maybe you should give the film another look; I admitted the story wasn't as strong as that of \\"First Blood\\" by any means, or even \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2\\" for that matter, but it still manages to hold its own within the `Rambo' franchise and serves as a better than average entry into the action film genre.    Sylvester Stallone and Richard Crenna, the only two actors to appear in the first three `Rambo' films, both know their characters inside and out by this point, that every movement, spoken word, and emotion seems so natural and effortless. I appreciated that some attempts were made to give Rambo some semblance of humanity by having him crack a few jokes and one-liners here and there over the course of the film, it showed to me that even though this is the third film in the franchise, there is still a desire to further develop John Rambo as a real character, and notjust another stoic action hero with zero emotion or range. The remainder of the cast was equally talented, and comprised of no one of any real standing in Hollywood. Even though the film didn't boast the bigger name talent that the other films had, other than Stallone and Crenna that is, the acting was still very solid all across the board which is surprising that there wasn't any obvious over-acting occurring by an over-zealous actor trying to make his role a breakthrough for his career.    \\"Rambo 3\\" is by no means the best entry into the venerable franchise, but it's also not nearly as bad as the critics would like for you all to believe. I for one, found the film to be another exciting, action-packed entry into this popular franchise, and thought it to be a film that needed a second glance rather than writing it off based on critics' opinions. The story was very relevant for its time, though seems a bit out of place in the overall franchise when you look at it from a post-9/11 perspective. I mean, one of America's heroes fighting alongside some of the very people that will try to kill us several years later, but that's the downside to making socially relevant films that take place during a specific place and time, sometimes later on down the line the choice to make that film doesn't seem as wise. The action sequences were just as big, if not bigger than those of \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2\\" and the body count was obviously higher than either of the first two films, but that seems to be the way things go in Hollywood action films and even horror movies for that matter. If you're going to make a sequel you must always have a bigger body count. By pointing out the increase in violence, I'm not trying to say that the action is the main driving force of the film, not at all; the story still propels the movie forward on its own, and is not the least bit dull when stuff isn't being blown up on screen. So, for those of you that loved the first two entries into the film and maybe didn't watch this third attempt based on the poor critical response, go ahead and give it a try you won't be sorry; and if you happen to be one of those viewers that were somewhat disappointed by the film, give it another look, who knows you might be surprised to find that it's better than you originally thought.    \\"Rambo 3\\" is rated R for violence and language.

B0011FXLCC|5.0|Goldfrapp outdid even Madonna's best electronica with \\"Supernature\\" and now \\"Seventh Tree\\" is PERFECT.  Gorgeous tunes are weaved thru smooth slow graceful flowing electronic sound.  When I think of all the back to back classics albums thru the years Goldfrapp will definately be on my list. \\"Supernature\\" is a great party album.  It always works when entertaining.  \\"Seventh Tree\\" is more of a \\"had a hard day and need to veg out\\", \\" dinner with the 30 somethings\\", or \\"my hippie soul is alive and well and living in these tunes\\" kind of album.  I love, love, love it!  The special edition is a cool novelty.
B000T0XED6|5.0|The sonic transparency of this recording, with its fully-realized dynamic range and splendid sense of three-dimensional sound stage, is the next best thing to actually being present in a very good seat in the Herkulessaal in the Residenz in Munich.   Maurizio Pollini's deep knowledge of Beethoven's music and life are clearly evident in this masterfully satisfying account of the three Op. 2 sonatas. Every dynamic and note just sound convincingly right. I think this is superb recording of a performance that Beethoven - who was of course an exceptional pianist too - could like very much. It is full of charm, wit and fresh surprise. The elegant playing is informed by what I can only describe as confidence born of humility. It is never mannered or dry. Unconditionally recommended for those who come to these sonatas for the first time, as well as those familiar with other recorded accounts.

As an adult, this mini-series is now at the core of my DVD library. Each performance makes this title a must see. Robert Duvall is the perfect cowboy and delivers a priceless performance. Tommy Lee Jones couldn't have played the stoic Woodrow Call any better. I highly recommend this DVD if you're even thinking about it. At $9.95 you can not go wrong. Plus, there's an interview with Larry McMurtry that gives some insight into the flick that you would never know not seeing it. My vote, this is a classic and should be added to your collection.
B000002KGT|5.0|Rumours is eminently listenable.  Recorded in inimitable 70's style: limited bandwidth  and high headroom. The songs are catchy and quickly executed, without any extraneous flourishes or detours.  The result is an album that can be listened to for hours without any diminishing of enjoyment.  In spite of the brevity of the songs, they are long on autobiographical references.  This combination of bouncy pop and earnest commentary prove to be a winning combination.  Throw in excellent musicianship, and you have all the makings of what it ultimately became: a classic.
B00004VW0V|5.0|I am not very familiar with the works of Cat Stevens. In fact apart from his chart hits the only record I know well is Foreigner Suite. I have been adding to my music collection lately and decided on some Cat Stevens. I have been reading the reviews of his albums and was amazed to learn that Foreigner Suite is regarded as a poor record.    I say amazed because Foreigner Suite is a brilliant record and has prompted me to buy 4 more Cat Stevens albums. I especially like the 18 minute long track called Foreigner Suite but I like all the tracks on this album. The 18 minute long track is engaging, emotionally satisfying and developes into a coherent whole. I am a lifelong Bob Dylan fan and I give this track the same respect I give to Dylan's work.    Don't worry about the poor reviews if you are thinking of buying this record. The man has created a masterpiece.
140120306X|1.0|Loved the first two...hated this one. Moore suffers under the weight of his own genius with extremely obscure literary references taking place of compelling storytelling. Very, very, hard to get through the dossier portion of this book. No fun.
0486450066|5.0|This book is a classic. It is very readable for such an important scientific work. Many people think they know what this book says, but they settle for second hand information--usually incomplete and sometimes just wrong. This book should be read by anyone interested in science, education, religion and  planet Earth.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I've never understood why people get off on hating Fred Durst and Limp Bizkit so much.  Sure he's kind of arrogant, but that kind of comes with the title of being a \\"rock star.\\"  The music should speak for itself...and in that case, LB is a great combo of pop/rap-metal.  Almost all the tracks on this album are catchy, well done tunes.  And i know all the Slipknot fans hate LB just because Fred disrespected their entire fan base by calling them \\"Ugly, Fat kids.\\"  But who cares?  I'm a big Slipknot fan and i still love this album.  So if you can manage to get past Fred's sh**ty public image, you'll probably get something out of this.
1863965513|5.0|When I first received this, I didn't think I could ever make a cake or cupcake that looks as good as the pictures in this book.  In fact, I'm still fairly certain I can't - and it doesn't even matter!  If you miss the mark a little, the stuff still looks great.  I just took a batch of bee and caterpillar cupcakes to school, and everyone raved about how cute they were - the kids, the teacher, even the administrators.  And my decorating skills are not exactly award-winning!    The decorations do require some time and energy (for example, I spent more than 2 hours decorating 32 cupcakes), but the results are worth it.  There's a good variety for boys and girls, and there are some adorable Halloween things, too.
B000XCZGV8|4.0|I've always been a huge fan of David Fincher and his work (including \\"Alien 3\\"). The look of his films are always magnificent and perfectly capture the mood the film is trying to convey. To this day, \\"Se7en\\" and \\"Fight Club\\" were my top two favorite films of his. Now, I can bump off \\"Fight Club\\" and put \\"Zodiac\\" in its place.     The story of the film begins in the late 60's in San Francisco, CA. A man, who calls himself the \\"Zodiac\\", has begun to kill people and leaves the police and the San Francisco Chronicle with letters and cryptic messages about who he is and why he's killing people. Throughout the story, different people are drawn into the case, trying to figure out the clues and who the killer could be.     Let me just say that this is a film that will not give you a clear conclusion at the end of the story. The Zodiac killer was never actually found. There was a prime suspect, but to this day, the case is still in the open.     Knowing this information (like I did) before seeing the film, makes one enjoy it even more. The film is not really about the Zodiac himself, but more about the people searching for him and the theme of obsession. Jake Gyllenhall, Robert Downey Jr, Anthony Edwards, and Mark Ruffalo all turn in marvelous performances as people with different roles trying to find answers. Some lose themselves to the case, while others thrive on it disgustingly.     The film moves at a slow, deliberate pace, but every scene is intense, be it through dialogue, atmosphere, or shot composition. As long as the film was, it never truly felt like it and cutting it in any way, would have ruined the whole.     The killings themselves are shown only in the first half, but they will stay with you until the end of the film. They are shown in graphic, realistic detail and that only makes them more shocking. The scene at Lake Berryessa had me (and the rest of the people in the room) freaking out. Disturbing, but not ridiculous.     Director David Fincher is a favorite of mine. From \\"The Game\\" to \\"Panic Room\\" to this, he's always impressed me with his visual style and direction. He seems a bit more suppressed here (no zany camera angles, fast edits, obscure shots) and that really helps the movie along. As I said before, it's not supposed to be a fast paced film and people looking for a slasher film will not like it. Even though it moves slow though, there are many scenes that will give you shivers, mainly the killings, the ending (brrr...), and a scene that takes place in a basement with Jake Gyllenhaal's character. I won't ruin it, but it really got to me.     Overall, \\"Zodiac\\" was a film that I really had no intention of seeing. I heard it was long and not much happens at all. Well, I'm glad I got around to viewing it. It's one of Fincher's best works and one of the best films I've seen this year.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie is fantastic, the special features with the extended songs are great, and the movie has great cinematography and uses symbolism and metaphors well.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I am in total AWE of this movie!!!!!  Gerard Butler--perfect for Eric--also for the other cast members!  Where were the Awards for this?  If I missed them, I'm sorry.

B0001ADAVK|2.0|Since the malnourished plot is already described elsewhere, I'll do everyone the favor of skipping what this film was about, or more accurately what it hoped to be about, and just tell you why I think seeing it represents two wasted hours of life. The boring, leaden-messaged Mona Lisa Smile reminded me that a studio got a lot of flavor-of-the-month twentysomething actresses together under contract and then scrambled to find some film to put them all in with a large anchor star. At least that's what the cobbled-together Mona Lisa Smile felt like to me. In its pre-release publicity for this film, the studio, as it struggled to define what this virtually plotless movie was about, latched comparisons onto superior productions from the past like Dead Poet's Society, and even Mr. Holland's Opus, all in an effort to bolster this turkey via association. I wonder if anyone was fooled? Mona Lisa Smile steals your time in a contrived, pointless, clumsy example of weak storytelling, while relying on big names to add some illusion of gravitas to the whole mess. It's like a massive wad of cotton candy sold in fancy packaging, and I for one found it pretty darned bad.
B000PTYP5C|4.0|This album is great, every song is played with alot of emotion and the instrumental is out of this world....Catchy and Melodic but Progressive and Technical at the same time....This is Dream Theater's best album since Scenes from a Memory IMO.
0736063684|5.0|The drawings in this book are certainly some of the best I've seen in this category.<br /><br />In terms of content, this book is divided into various body parts namely arms, shoulders, chest, back, legs, buttocks and abdomen. There are more than 10 exercises under each section. For each body part, a series of exercises highlighting the muscles involved are presented. All active muscles are highlighted and the passive ones are labelled as well. Note accompany the drawings to provide instructions on how each exercise should be performed.<br /><br />Both male and female bodies are featured. Exercises featured include those using free weights and machines. After reading this book, anyone interested in strength training (not necessarily serious bodybuilding) should be able to choose a few exercises that will suit his/her needs. No need for expensive gym equipment or memberships. The book shows us that some highly effective exercises can be performed at home or the children's playground.<br /><br />Once again, the drawings are simply awesome. A great reference book for anyone who is intrested in strength training.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0785264868 What Your Doctor Doesn't Know About Nutritional Medicine May Be Killing You]]
0767812166|5.0|This is a movie everyone can love, not just science fiction fans.  Jeff Bridges, young and buffed, plays the starman who uses DNA in a lock of hair from the husband of a grieving young widow to clone a body for himself.  Science fiction fans will love watching the clone grow in a very realistic special effects scene; fans of buffed young men will love the result.<br /><br />He learns quickly, but oddly.  The whole movie constitutes a playing out of the old adage of \\"to see ourselves as others see us.\\"  And of course, much of it really is very funny.  Because much of American life is very funny, when you think about it.  Starman will make you think about it.<br /><br />There are not a lot of special effects, but there are several really wonderful concepts, like when the starman revives a doe that had been tied across the trunk of a hunter's car.<br /><br />But a woman cannot run around with a clone of her beloved husband for too long before sex comes to mind.  And it does.  Starman gleefully declares it is better than Dutch Apple Pie!  As Pennsylvania Dutch myself, that's pretty darn high praise.<br /><br />\\"I have left you with a baby,\\" Starman says.  \\"No, that's not possible; I can't have a baby.  I'm sterile.\\" But of course it is there.<br /><br />He has to go back, or he will die.  He tells the young widow, who is now effectively losing her husband a second time, to tell the child about him.  As the Starman explains, it is her husband's baby, but it is also his.<br /><br />It's a better movie than I am able to describe. Buy it and cherish it!
B000RW3YYA|5.0|I LIKE IT!!! I won't begin to go into a write up like other gifted individuals but this is great for a 10 year old locked in a 50 yr old man. Kirk references were funny by McKay but that's about the limit on that character. I don't like his smart [...] ways but there are some episodes where he shows a more human side. Sunday just sucked as a story  but the episode was performed very well. You'll know what I mean when you get there. I won't mention how attractive I think Dr Weir is..but I guess I already did. Actors/actresses did a great job in all episodes thus far and what surprised me is they're all Canadian except for the MASH guy(sorry fella). Good job aye! Found it pretty cool that the studio is in Vancouver considering I was stationed just south of there. I'm really getting stupid in this so I'll stop. Strange that I had to deploy to the Middle East to discover this series but so glad I did...discover it I mean. Had to pace myself because I was making marathon watching the norm.

0452270073|4.0|This book covers some of the same ground as Ben Elton's praiseworthy [[ASIN:0552771309 The First Casualty]], although in an entirely different way. Both try to retrofit as mainstream largely post-60s values towards homosexuality, pacifism, and atheism (in the latter case by omission in writing as if Christianity was as marginalised as it is today, an historical absurdity), but in their defence it could be reasonably argued that of course homosexuals, pacifists and atheists/agnostics were plentiful. While Elton surrounds his message with action and a crime story, Barker instead goes deeply into conversation and rumination, and in both cases there's so much more to the book than mere preaching.<br /><br />Barker ambitiously imagines encounters between real and fictional historical figures. Of course once she's imagining dialogue that's not recorded her characters are all fictional, but her painstaking research (and the availability of so much detailed material) makes for some powerfully authentic writing. Moreover she has an impressive ability for informed empathy: she asks herself, \\"What would Dr. Rivers, or Sassoon have been thinking? How would they have reacted?\\" and comes up with some fascinating and plausible answers. Plausible? Hang on a minute: they seem plausible to me, a guy who'd never even heard of Rivers or Sassoon before reading this book! It would be interesting to hear reactions of others who had studied (or knew) them.<br /><br />There is not a standard plot, and much of the book is composed of recreations of counselling sessions between `shell-shocked' soldiers and their psychologist. Barker's version of Dr. Rivers is a real triumph - one of the most developed characters I've probably come across. Hats off to Barker for having the skill, compassion and intelligence to convince us of Rivers' skill, compassion and intelligence by what she has him say and do. He's not a quaint historical curiosity, but clearly someone Barker has read extensively and admires. The way she's immersed herself in writing from the time making her characters not `just like us', but still wonderfully real reminds me of O'Brian's marvellous RN stories (much as the authors portray quite distinct attitudes towards battle).he's immersed herself in writing from the time making her characters not `just like us', but still wonderfully real reminds me of O'Brian's marvellous RN stories (much as the authors portray quite distinct attitudes towards battle).
B00004WIDQ|4.0|Dinosaur-mania peaked with the movie based on Michael Crichton's novel. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic Era between 65 and 220 million years ago. The Mesozoic Era is divides into Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. Jurassic Park brings dinosaurs into the present by cloning them from DNA. They are kept on an island with plans of making them an attraction. They get loose. The velociraptors are fierce. T Rex goes on a rampage. I felt that not enough species were represented. Where are triceratops and stegosaurus? duckbills and ankylosaurs? The theme that man should not tamper with nature is ridiculous because the whole point of science and technology is that man can better himself by understanding and harnessing natural forces. Movie makers are negative. Both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg use dark, chaotic scenes.
0684865130|5.0|This didn't live up to my hopes re-reading it twenty years on from the first time - but that's not too surprising given how I relished it then. I suppose much of the pleasure was in how much it shocked and stung - something it's not going to do twice. It's hardly a book that needs any more discussion, so this is more just logging my response. Catch 22 was a wonderful foil to the stiff-upper lip jingoism of so much war literature and cinema, and Heller hilariously pilloried the dubious and at times absurd morality of the military. However this isn't just for laughs - we're not talking Hogan's Heroes farce or McHale's Navy peacetime shenanigans - the humour is as black as it comes. Just as you're wetting yourself laughing at something ridiculous part of you realises this is too close to reality, and the guys falling down dead aren't just cartoons.<br /><br />This book just overflows with manic wit while managing to powerfully confront some big establishment issues. Unfortunately the next book I tracked down of Heller's, Something Happened, was just an embittered humourless mess. Somehow the same apparent lack of discipline enhances Catch 22.<br /><br />A tricky thing these days, but may you come to this wonderful book without any prior knowledge or expectations.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|I thought, \\"Why would anyone do Batman in 1989?\\" It turned out to be a strong, dark movie. Kim Basinger is Batman's girl friend. Jack Nicholson is the Joker. Roger Ebert felt that Batman is mostly form with little substance. He felt that it is rich in atmosphere with very little happening. He was right. In retrospect, it is hard to recall the plot. Comic book movies have certainly had their day. I had trouble with the Batman logo. It looks like some kind of weird boomerang. I realized it is the image of a bat flashed against a cloud cover. Beware of sequels.

Advice if you want the item soon, pay extra and buy it at a local store if you can.  Otherwise order well in advance and expect it to take however long it takes.....in this case almost four weeks.

0689865384|5.0|I've only seen one episode of The Twilight Zone. In this episode, a woman undergoes a battery of surgeries to look normal. At the end of the episode, viewers learn that this latest surgery has failed: the woman is still hideous. Except that to the audience she is beautiful. Online research led me to another episode where teenagers are surgically altered to live longer and conform to a unified standard of beauty (based on a limited number of acceptable \\"models\\"). \\"Uglies,\\" Scott Westerfeld's dystopic novel, plays similar games of perception.<br /><br />The novel starts with Tally Youngblood a fifteen-year-old girl desperately waiting for her sixteenth birthday when she will be reunited with her best friend and, more importantly, when she will finally be pretty.<br /><br />\\"Uglies\\" is set in the distant future after a mysterious global catastrophe precipitated changes to the foundations of what readers would call modern society. Fearful of war and violence cities now operate as independent states (think Renaissance Italy as opposed to contemporary Italy). Isolated and self-sufficient, the cities have agreed to certain standards for the greater good.<br /><br />New technology ensures that citizens never want for food or luxury items, weapons of any kind are largely illegal, and at the age of sixteen everyone undergoes a series of extreme surgeries to better conform to societal standards of beauty. The logic being that, since humans are preconditioned to respond to certain visual cues in each other already (big eyes are non-threatening, a clear complexion and good teeth indicate that a person is healthy), applying these beauty standards will reduce conflict and create a more harmonious society.<br /><br />But in a world where everyone is movie-star-gorgeous (oldies like Rudolph Valentino and Greta Garbo are considered \\"natural pretties\\"), normal people are so not pretty. In short, they're ugly.<br /><br />Things change for Tally when she meets Shay, another Ugly girl, who wants to run away before the operation to a place called The Smoke where people can live like \\"Rusties\\" (that would be us basically) in the wilderness without any surgery. As the novel progresses, and Special Circumstances (a government agency) coerces Tally into finding The Smoke for them, Tally is forced to choose what means more: friendship or beauty?<br /><br />As the plot might suggest, this is a science fiction novel. Just to be clear, the real difference between sci-fi and fantasy is that the technology in science fiction novels could conceivably work if someone ever built it (dragons, most likely, are never going to be genetically engineered so they're a good indicator of a fantasy novel). At times this leads to more explanation of, say, hoverboard mechanics in the novel than is strictly necessary to the plot but the rest of the book makes up for this small shortcoming.<br /><br />What makes \\"Uglies\\" great, besides how it looks at cultural values, is Westerfeld's use of language. The novel is not pretentious or brash. Instead, Westerfeld creates a narrative voice that is really unique--especially for a sweeping sci-fi saga like the Uglies trilogy. The novel opens with Tally observing that \\"The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.\\" That is not, it is fair to say, a typical opening for any novel. Yet Westerfeld moves from that observation seamlessly into the story.<br /><br />This book is the first in the Uglies trilogy (followed by \\"Pretties\\" and \\"Specials\\") which focuses on Tally and her city. The scope of each book can largely stand alone, but to get the full story it's best to read the entire trilogy. Additionally, Westerfeld released a companion book to the trilogy last year called \\"Extras\\" which is set a few years after the trilogy with different main characters.<br /><br />\\"Uglies\\" is simultaneously funny and frightening, showing how overvalued beauty can be while illustrating how Tally's world has been conditioned to believe there's no otherway to live. The sections where Westerfeld describes the Rusty Ruins and the end of that era are particularly haunting (and eerily reminiscent of the History Channel's recent documentary \\"Life After People\\").<br /><br />Sci-fi book discussions often bring up a writer's \\"world building\\" in reference to how well a writer creates their alternate universe. Westerfeld's world is built really well. The cities have their own culture, the characters their own slang, but Westerfeld manages to bring in enough references to our own contemporary culture that it's easy for readers to believe Tally's world is built on the ruins of our own.way to live.

0385338724|4.0|Light as a feather, this novel begs to be made into a romantic comedy, with a younger Sandra Bullock as the amnesia-struck Lexi.<br /><br />Its premise, about a woman in her late twenties who wakes up and discovers she is three years older and completely different from who she remembers being, is not exactly new. But Kinsella places you inside Lexi's head, which is an interesting and amusing place to be. Witty writing is enough for a book like this, which isn't supposed to be War and Peace.<br /><br />There are no big surprises, but it is funny and well-crafted and moves with a brisk pace. It's the perfect summer beach read.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|I loved this movie and the music. At first I was skeptical about whether I'd like hearing Beatles music performed by other musicians but they really did a stellar job. The music was very very well done!     Having lived through the sixties, and being very familiar with the Beatles, no doubt added to my understanding and enjoyment of this movie. I can definitely understand why many younger people, or people not that familiar with the Beatles, would have trouble relating to it.    This release has extras that I place GREAT VALUE on!!! In particular, many of the songs that were performed in the movie are delivered complete (not just the partial songs that made it into the final movie). You also get to see additional footage while you view and listen to these great songs in high quality surround sound!!!     For me, there's only so many times I can enjoy watching a movie. My all time favorites have been viewed perhaps 10 to 12 times. But when it comes to my favorite music, I've heard my favorite albums more than 100 times and continue to enjoy it. So, in the future, what is really valuable to me isn't so much the movie itself, but the high quality extras which amount to really great music videos! That's what I'll continue to watch and enjoy in the years to come.    And, that's the kind of thing which will sway my decision to rent or buy. This Blu-Ray is a keeper!
0385341067|5.0|What a fantastic book! Despite the fact that Mister Pip takes place during a civil war, much of the early descriptions of island life sound almost idyllic, since they are told from a young person's (and a relatively sheltered one) viewpoint. The children's immersion in Dickens' narrative is contagious--I can't wait to find my copy for another reading! The rather abrupt shift to violence and brutality just reinforces how quickly situations can change for any of us. I hope the Booker Prize committee chooses Mister Pip--I'd rank it close to a former Booker winner, The Life of Pi.
B00009ATIX|4.0|I really liked George Clooney's remake of Solaris. I saw the original Russian version, which had a lot of 70s Russian cinematic tics (like long, slow, pointless establishing shots and the overdevelopment of extremely minor characters); Clooney's remake is startlingly faithful to the original, which may be why so few people liked it --- the pace was slow, too --- while paring down the truly incomprehensible plot offshoots. If you can free yourself from your Hollywood expectations of how fast stuff should happen on screen, the Solaris remake is very good scifi. Good viewing!
B0011FXLCC|5.0|So another Goldfrapp album is out and like clockwork, when Alison changes direction, she alienates legions of fans. This is nothing new of course. Just look at the reviews for Black Cherry from people who were huge fans of Felt Mountain. It cracks me up because these same people who are lambasting Seventh Tree right now, will be loving it in about 4 months.    People should be thankful Goldfrapp has given us another side to admire and indulge ourselves in. I didn't want another Felt Mountain, or Black Cherry, or Supernature. This album is what I wanted and before it was released I didn't know what I wanted from them. That is what's so great about Goldfrapp. You don't know what kind of musical ride they'll take you on next, but you best believe when it comes that it will be one of the best rides of your life.    So back to the album. This album is effing brilliant - dare I say before its time, like most of Goldfrapp's albums. It evokes memories of the Cocteau Twins (who I am a big fan of) circa Heaven or Las Vegas.     I plead to you people who would give this album a negative review - just wait for the initial shock of change to wear off, soak it all in, and then when the fog has cleared, come back and tell people how lush these soundscapes and alison's vocals are.     Fan's of Goldfrapp owe it to other fans of Goldfrapp. This is another one for the ages.

B0000AQS0F|2.0|I know I'm going to get low scores but here goes. Right off the bat my  biggest complaint is the over the top sexual and violent situations.  35 years ago this show would have been rated R which is what I would give it. I bought this set based on the recomendations of others on Amazon.  You can have a decent show without all the immorality. Stargate Atlantis blows this show away and doesn't have near the sex and violence of firefly.   The idea of a futuristic Western is good but I thought Joss Whedon should of had more \\"Western\\" in the series. I don't consider this a classic like Stargate,the early Star Wars, Dr.Who or Star Trek. The actors were a great choice and they did have the spark of a cast that seemed to bounce off each other well.
B00005JL1C|4.0|SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL is an adult film because it is now 21 years old. It was theatrically released 21 years ago today,as a matter of fact. And is not an adult film because it is not pornographic(this may make you chuckle). Anyway,director John Hughes(PLANES TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES,SHE'S HAVING A BABY,CURLY SUE,HOME ALONE 1 & 2),worked with a talented cast featuring Eric Stoltz(MASK),Lea Thompson(HOWARD THE DUCK),Mary Stuart Masterson(FUNNY ABOUT LOVE,FRIED GREEN TOMATOES) and John Ashton(BEVERLY HILLS COP 1 & 2,MIDNIGHT RUN,LITTLE BIG LEAGUE). Thompson and MSM are respectively,Stoltz's love interests. Interestingly,MSM plays drums in the film. Ashton is Keith's(Stoltz) father Cliff,a service station attendant. This film,like many others,features a great pop music soundtrack. Subsequently,Ashton had cameos in SHAB and CS.
0767817478|4.0|You can probably come up with negatives about this movie, but actually, for $4.99 with super saver shipping, this movie delivers pretty good entertainment.  It's worth it alone for the pier scene.  I consider it a campy remake of the original, which is still the best, but at least the language and violence level are such that I can show it to my grandchildren.

B0001MDPV8|5.0|What can I say that countless other reviewers have not? If you consider yourself a true Hip Hop fan, you must have this album.  Since I was only six when this album came out, I was introduced to rap by Eminem in High School. All I knew was what I heard on the radio until I started buying CDs.  At one point I was in the music store and found two CDs at a good price: Illmatic - the platinum version and Get Rich or Die Tryin. I had to make a choice between the two.  I made the right choice and picked Illmatic based on good reviews I read here on Amazon.  At first I did not get the hype, it all went straight over my head. I listened to it again and again until something inside me clicked.  Now, this is my favourite album.  Here's what I thought of each track:    -1. THE GENESIS 3/5 - Great intro, the beat is grimy and gets me amped up for the rest of the album. Listen closely for Nas's verse from LIVE AT THE BARBEQUE in the background \\"Street's disciple, my raps are trifle / I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle\\"(the only reason it gets 3/5 is because its an intro as apposed to a full song)    -2. N.Y. STATE OF MIND 5/5 - My personal favourite.  Some of DJ Premier's best work is on this album. The beat is dark and gritty.  There is an acute sense of a young man trapped in a dangerous world. It is tense and dark.  A Rakim sample for the hook completes it. \\"Heard a few chicks scream my arm shook, couldn't look / Gave another squeeze heard it click yo, my s*** is stuck\\"    -3. LIFE'S A B**** 5/5 - A killer debut verse from Brooklyn rapper AZ, though both emcees shine immensely. Both feel like they're trapped in the system. Nas has smoother flow, but I consider this song to belong to AZ. \\"Visualizin the realism of life and actuality / F*** who's the baddest a person's status depends on salary\\".  Minimalist production from L.E.S. is overshadowed by the more experienced producers, love Olu Dara's trumpet solo at the end.    -4. THE WORLD IS YOURS 5/5 - Some of the most poetic work from Nas. The idea that one can take they're life into their own hands is a startling contrast to the previous track. Pete Rock's production is jazzy and I like the hook he drops. \\"I keep fallin, but never fallin six feet deep / I'm out for presidents to represent me\\".    -5. HALFTIME 3.5/5 - An appropriate track for the middle of the album. It was Nas's first single, released on the soundtrack for Zebrahead two years earlier.  It is probably the weakest track on the CD, more or less because Nas is all over the place. However, it features some very clever wordplay throughout and interesting production from the Large Professor that sounds like a matching of jazz and jingle bells. \\"I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex / In your stereo sets, Nas will catch wreck\\".    -6. MEMORY LANE 5/5 - You can picture Nas sitting on the stoop writing hits lyrics, he paints pictures with his lyrics. Of course, Primo's supreme production helps.  \\"Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop / I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop, straight off the block\\".    -7. ONE LOVE 5/5 - A conceptual track in which Nas writes his friends that are incarcerated in San Quentin then he schools a youngster headed down the road to prison.  Q-Tip's production is spot on, the echoing sounds evoke images of jail cells. \\"Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul / only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style\\".    -8. ONE TIME 4 YOUR MIND 4/5 - Along with Large Professor's beat, Nas is laid back plus his flow is spot on. This one doesn't pop out as much as the other tracks though. \\"Ya'll n****s was born , I shot my way out my Mom Dukes\\".    -9. REPRESENT 5/5 - After chillin' to the previous track, get back up again for this high energy beat from Premier. I love bumping this on in the car. Nas is on point, representing the QB. \\"This n**** raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue / The school drop-out, never liked the s*** from day one\\".    -10. IT AIN'T HARD TO TELL 4.5/5- Nas lyrically kills this track. I did not give it 5/5 due to the lack of direction in this track that was present in the others. He averages about 4 rhymes every 2 lines. Some nice jazzy production from the Professor. \\"Inhale from the L, school a fool well, you feel it like braille / It ain't hard to tell, I kick the skill like Shaquille holds a bill / Vocabulary spills I'm Ill\\".      The Platinum version has 4 remixes and a couple bonus tracks.  I would recommend buying it if you can get it for the same price as the original or close:    -1. LIFE'S A B**** (REMIX) 4.5/5 - The vocals come through a bit clearer in all the remixes. Rockwilder's beat is rather pop sounding, but seem to work fine. I still prefer the original.    -2. THE WORLD IS YOURS (REMIX) 5/5 - Missing a bit of hook that I'm fond of, but Vibesmen's piano driven production fits nicely, I think this is the only track I consider on par with the original.    -3. ONE LOVE (REMIX) 4/5 - The clean version, for some reason.  Production by Nick \\"Fury\\" also sounds very pop that seems to still work with the song due to the contrast with the dark nature of the lyrics. It just does not match up to the original.    -4. IT AIN'T HARD TO TELL (REMIX) 4/5 - Since this is a show of lyricism, the hyped concert sound of this version suits it. Still, I prefer the jazziness of the original. Also interesting to note that he mixes up his verses and uses alternate verses. I am not sure if they are new or previously written.    -5. ON THE REAL 3.5/5 - Pays homage to Illmatic and advertises Streets Disciple. Includes a ten year old verse, and old school sounding production from Marley Marl.  Basically Nas tried to recreate what he did on Illmatic.  Looking closely, everything seems on par, yet all together it doesn't hold together well. \\"To my seed, may I lead you into no greed or evil / In the categories of stories I breed my sequel\\". I don't like the hook either.    -6. STAR WARS 5/5 - Recent track. Very different production from Large Professor. Kind of a dark technological sound. It doesn't attempt to sound like Illmatic. Nas is more or less disgusted with hip-hop super stardom. \\"It's shockin - you thinkin \\"naw it's just rhymin\\"  But all this time it's like organized crimin\\".    That pretty much covers everything.  Give me feedback if you agree or disagree.
6305127689|4.0|Tom Cruise and director Tony Scott are an incredible working pair making this 1986 blockbuster. Three years earlier,Syracuse,New York native Cruise delighted audiences in RISKY BUSINESS,especially the scene where he dances in a dress shirt and underpants. Anyway,Scott also directed some other talented actors such as Kelly McGillis(MADE IN HEAVEN,THE ACCUSED),Val Kilmer(THE DOORS),Tom Skeritt(STEEL MAGNOLIAS) and Meg Ryan(WHEN HARRY MET SALLY,SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE,PRELUDE TO A KISS,FRENCH KISS,YOU'VE GOT MAIL). Cruise is an air force pilot and Kilmer is his fellow pilot. McGillis plays Cruise's love interest. Of course,the two have their own love scene when TAKE MY BREATH AWAY performed by Berlin plays. You'll also hear other great songs performed by major artists like Loverboy,Miami Sound Machine,Kenny Loggins,Teena Marie and Cheap Trick. In addition to TMBA,other hit songs include HEAVEN IN YOUR EYES performed by Loverboy and of course,DANGER ZONE performed by Loggins. Scott subsequently directed BEVERLY HILLS COP 2 and DAYS OF THUNDER,both Paramount properties as is this film. DOT marked the reunion of Scott and Cruise and Cruise's introduction to his future now-ex-wife Nicole Kidman. Also,listen for YOU'VE LOST THAT LOVIN' FEELING performed by The Righteous Brothers although it didn't appear on the soundtrack album. Like for BEVERLY HILLS COP and its two sequels,Harold Faltermeyer and Keith Forsey wrote some music for this film. The pair's TOP GUN ANTHEM(an instrumental piece performed by Faltermeyer) also is on the soundtrack album. A trivial note:In the final scene of the 1987 Warner Bros. comedy POLICE ACADEMY 4,Bobcat Goldthwait told Tim Kazurinsky that he(Kazurinsky) looked a little like Cruise in TOP GUN,being that PA4 was filmed around summer 1986 when TG was in theatres. Also,TG inspired two Pepsi-Cola commercials involving airplanes and pilots that were filmed around the time TG hit video rental/retail outlets. I'm surprised this blockbuster didn't inspire any sequels. Cruise was at least nominated for one or more Oscars for this film. Cruise's subsequent hit films include THE COLOR OF MONEY,COCKTAIL and the four-Oscar-winner RAIN MAN.
B00003CWLF|5.0|I love this movie! It is beautifully filmed and generally well-acted. The story portrays the cultural and philosophical differences and subsequent personal growth of the characters without being \\"preachy\\". It is easily as good as any Jane Austen remake and has better storylines and incredible scenery. The role of king is brilliantly portrayed by Chow Yun Fat and shows the deep and thoughtful wisdom of this leader. Great movie.
B000TKW3E2|2.0|maybe almost 3 stars...  the score is lame, compared to pride & prejudice  can't see how it won an award  big fan of thibaudet in p&p...did nothing impressive here
B0000CEB62|5.0|If you're just being introduced to Depeche Mode or you're a very devoted fan, this is an item for you.  It's a must!  This DVD set includes tons of amazing color concert clips on Disc Two and the 101 documentary on Disc One.  Originally released on VHS at the end of the 80s in black and white, this updated, expanded re-issue is amazing!<br /><br />This concert and time-period for the band was during their increasing peak of popularity.  At the time this was their biggest event yet.  This band was known then as being an amazing live act and could fill any stadium they chose to.  This DVD set captures the DM experience as well as any would be able to do.<br /><br />For Depeche Mode newbies: Their Violator album was even bigger for them and started the next stage of their career for them.  That next stage was and is amazing, but if you're wondering what they were before then, this is an amazing sampler of what they had to offer with their previous albums.  Though to be fair, some (if not all) performances on the DVD out-perform their album offerings.  They changed a little bit (not much) on some tracks, but their performance is amazing and brings their biggest hits and strongest concert-tracks to a higher level than any studio album could convey.<br /><br />So if you're just curious about their sound and style, get this.  If you're a fan of their music, you must already have this or at least the audio CDs of this.  Either way, if you don't have it, get it!  You won't regret it!
032147404X|4.0|This book is an easy laid back reading material.  The writer puts some humor into the subject matter with enough technical information not to get you lost in the details.  I find this book effective for those who are leaving the pocket camera setup and moving into the introductory SLR such as the Nikon D40 or Canon. The writer offers a wide range of picture taking situations and covers a lot of helpful camera features.  I also like the advice this book offers on camera gear and digital support hardware.  The author even touched upon some available software and editing programs.  I find this book extremely helpful for those who want to get the best out of their first time SLR use.  I may be buying the second \\"step up\\" book on digital photography from the same author soon.
B000Q6GUTI|2.0|If you hate the United States, you will love this movie.  It's the same garbage that Hollywood has been churning out for a long time.  True to typical Hollywood form, the great enemy is the United States government.  Some sinister politicians decide that innocent villagers in a foreign country simply must be slaughtered in order for an oil extraction deal to move ahead.  Of course the US military happily does the job.  A massive cover-up ensues bringing our poor, reluctant hero (Mark Wahlberg) into the fray to make everything right.  After battling the US military and killing the evil politicians, the world is happy again and the great satan (the US) is given a good bloody nose.  I gave this movie two stars simply because it started out good when Mark Wahlberg's character waxes some enemy fighters with his sniper rifle.  It's interesting how people can have such contempt for the free country that gives them the right to say what they want and the soldiers who spill their guts and die face down in the mud to keep them free.  Please don't support socialist/elitist propaganda by buying this movie.
B000W1V5VU|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching the 1st two installments of the Ocean's film series, but not this one so much. I felt like there were some good moments in this film, but felt it paled in comparison to both Ocean's 11 & 12.     The overall plot for Ocean's 13 lacked a lot of the appeal, cohesiveness, tightly written plot twists and turns, and so on that made Ocean's 11 & 12 great, engaging movies to watch from start to finish.
B0013UIUBC|2.0|It has its moments and the major cast members are great, but it's so predictable that even they seem bored with it.  It's cute, yes, and worth a one-time viewing, but it could have been so much more.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|As expected, the black titanium model turned out to be a superior product with excellent design and sleek finish. Th dial is simple and elegant. The mesh design and the metal used ensures that the strap lies very flat on the wrist.    I have owned a Skagen model prior to this and am convinced of the durability and quality of the Skagen line.
B0012K1ILW|4.0|You never know what to expect from Badu.  She has always been a revoultionary and ahead of her time. New Amerykah proves that. There are some awesome tracks like;  ME, Soldier, Telephone and of course Honey, then there are some tracks that leave you pondering and scratching your head. That's Erykah at her best.  I think music is suppose to make you think and invoke a gamet of emotions and New Amerykah does just that.  That's what great artist do, sit back and enjoy the ride with Badu.
0060090383|5.0|Wow, I am now officially hooked on Marian Keyes.  What a delight!  I have LUCY SULLIVAN IS GETTING MARRIED, but never got very far.  I'll have to go back and try again now that I completed this book.  The story of Rachel and her facing her self head-on was so uplifting.  I, like many, have dealt with low-self esteem for most of my life.  I have never had a drug problem, but I definitely could relate to the character with the low self-esteem issues.  This whole book helped unravel a lot for myself and more importantly, helped me even heal from old wounds.  What a wonderful story and how Marian found the way to tell this story, so candidly, so clearly, so true is absolutely amazing.  She will touch you with her words and help you see inside the life of a girl gone wrong turned survivor.  I highly recommend this book.  I love how she unfolds the story, keeps the reader hooked and coming back for more.  I have to applaud Marian Keyes for her great piece of work - bravo!
B00006FR47|5.0|CHICAGO V, the first single album for Chicago, marks a turning point for the band, as the editorial review said. Apparently, the band realized that they couldn't go on making double albums forever, and decided to pare down in order to recharge their batteries. The result was a Top Ten hit with \\"Saturday In The Park\\", a joyous, uplifting call for peace among all, and a Top 30 hit with \\"Dialogue\\", which was another call for tolerance among individuals. This CD is great all around, and shows the band becoming more commercial while still rocking consistently.
B000WO251Q|5.0|There are too many spoilers in the comments by other reviewers, you will enjoy this masterpiece a lot more, if like me, you don't know how it concludes. I picked up the audio book at the library read by Holter Graham (to perfection) and fell into a very realistic tale of Savannah the pretty college student and John a soldier on two-week leave from the Army. The easy \\"down-home\\" storytelling and dialogue was so real it almost feels like it's not made up. Nicholas Sparks is a fantastic writer who I've enjoyed before but Dear John was easily on a higher level of entertainment value for this reader.

B0012K1ILW|4.0|You have to be ready for this ride because it does not resemble any of the so called r&b/neo-soul out there. Erykah goes deep, as usual, but this time around, she is really mixing up the sounds. Funk, jazz, space aged pimped out loops from another planet make this whole album worth listening to. The thing is...you have to listen a few times to \\"get it\\" and if you're really enlightened, you'll \\"get it\\" just fine. Honey is about the only song that's gonna get airplay, it's the most commercial. \\"I'm just tryin to pay my rent\\" is what she talks about on \\"HUMP\\" and we hear about the struggles of being a mother and just trying to make it. She says, \\"Lord knows I'm tryin\\" and you can relate, even if you've not \\"been there\\".   Erykah's voice is always pure but it's also matured too, and you can hear it in her delicate lilt, which is on the sultry side now. There's a sadness in her voice too....but not regret. I just love \\"Telephone\\" her tribute to J-Dilla. It's beautiful.    I had to self-edit because my intial review was only after listening to the album 2x. I made an error. This album is worth 5 stars for so many reasons I don't know where to start. The lyrics to all of the songs are dope, and definitely made with the \\"thinkers\\" in mind. I can't stop listening to to this album
B000XCZGV8|1.0|I was surprised by the poor image quality on this DVD.  There are constant digital artifacts, and the darker the lighting of a scene, the more the artifacts are evident.  If I had seen this film without knowing the source was a DVD, I would have thought it was a mediocre cable transmission.  I am not a digital video expert, but the artifacts seem to result more from digital noise reduction than from compression, at least as I understand the effects.  In any case, the unstable, wavy, and smeary images really sap the energy of the film.  (This refers to the regular DVD version, not to the HD DVD version, which I haven't seen.)

B0012K1ILW|4.0|I have been a fan of Erykah Badu since \\"Baduizm\\" and the progression of her music and artistic expression has always been impressive. This time, she jumped about ten light years ahead of the \\"neo soul\\" field with New Amerykah..Her astounding comprehension of Funk, Soul, Jazz and Hip Hop has never been more apparent, and Badu and her brilliant bunch of producers deftly manipulate the best elements of these genres to create a truly futuristic, yet sentimental album at the same time. Also, we have never seen such stark socio-political statements woven in the music from Badu before. This album is not for the casual consumer of urban music. For a trendy, disposable, and utterly forgettable experience, check out Janet's Discipline. If you are in search for the next ground-breaking hip-hop/soul/r&b album, New Amerykah is your answer
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie is an awesome movie mostly because its about music! It really explains how we feel when we hear great music and when we are playing great music!!! Definitely a favorite and a keeper!!!
B0012GVKVY|5.0|I have this film on standard DVD and in Hi-Def (D-Theatre VHS HD 1080i.) The special effects AND the storyline really bring out today's advancement in possible future predictions in story telling and visual effects tecnology in film making. In my opinion it is one of the best Sci-Fi films made. Although I have this film on D-VHS HD 1080i I still plan on buying it on Blu-ray when available.
B0010V4TZU|1.0|I haven't been this disappointed in a new CD in a long time.  I've read almost nothing but rave reviews about these guys, but I don't get it.  It is extremely shallow pop music with very little recognizable \\"African beat\\" that has been so hyped up in everything I've read.  Every song sounds alike....this is trite, bubblegum pap as far as I'm concerned, and I am generally very flexible in my musical tastes.
B000002VEP|3.0|I know a number of other Alan Parsons Project fans will take offense at this, but I just don't think that \\"Gaudi\\", the last Alan Parsons Project album (1987 release), was a 5-star effort.  That doesn't mean that \\"Gaudi\\" lacks quality or value...far from it!  This album sees the return of APP to a dedicated concept album.<br /><br />This album's concept focuses on the life, challenges, and eventual demise of Antonio Gaudi, a man whose main goal in life was to honor God by building a magnificent cathedral.  But, alas, like the song \\"Money Talks\\" says, he didn't have enough $ to complete the project.  That story provides lots of material for Parsons and Woolfson, and the result is \\"Gaudi\\".<br /><br />As for the individual songs, well, there are only 7 of them on the disc.  Only 7 tracks!!<br />- La Sagrada Familia - This narrative piece w/ background music sets the stage and introduces the story of Antonio Gaudi.  I give it 4/5 stars.<br />- Too Late - is a tune with a repetitive beat, but isn't all that engaging. 2/5 stars.<br />- Closer to Heaven - This is the highlight of the album for me.  It is the best example on this disc of the definitive APP mellow sound. 5/5 stars!<br />- Money Talks - This piece points out the main challenge Gaudi faced as he tried to finance his project.  The song has a clipped progressive rock sound similar to that of \\"Stereotomy\\"...I give it 3/5 stars.<br />- Inside Looking Out - This is one of those etherial APP pieces kind of like \\"Somebody Out There\\".  I tend to like that APP style, so I give this track 4/5<br />- Paseo De Gracia - This instrumental piece was not that inspiring, and I give it 3/5 stars.<br /><br />All in all, I give this album 3/5 stars.  It does have a clear and consistent concept, something that's missing from some of their other albums, but I felt like this album was light...it just didn't offer as much as most of their other albums.  Am I sad that I bought this album?  Absolutely not!  It's just not one of their best.<br /><br />Finally, I was sad when I heard that \\"Gaudi\\" was the last APP album, and that Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson were splitting up to head their own ways to pursue their own projects.  Still, it was a great run!  Thank you for the music!!!<br /><br />A 30+ year APP listener and fan.audi\\" was the last APP album, and that Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson were splitting up to head their own ways to pursue their own projects.

006056251X|5.0|Lisa Kleypas' Wallflower series was one of my favorite post-Regency historical romance sets of the last year or so. And of the 4 books this book and Lillian's story where my two favorite. This author has such a beautiful, lyrical style to her prose.    If you like watching a cynical rake like the hero, Viscount Sebastion St. Vincent, find the beauty of falling in love with a deserving lady - then this is the book for you! This books hero reminded me somewhat of Kleypas' other book with a jaded hero - \\"Dreaming of You.\\" I loved both books very much.    The heroine, Evie, stutters and because of it, she is the quietest - and kindest of all the 4 heroines in the series. She is forced in the dead of night to offer marriage (and the large dowery he craves) to a man she barely knows, who even tried to kidnap her best friend. But he is her last resort since her relatives are plotting a thoroughly unpalatable marriage. I thought it was interesting how the heroine stuttered less around the rake than anyone else when she should have been terrified. It showed that unconciously she knew there was an angel under all the jaded facade.    This is another series where you do not have to read the books in order. I didn't and I didn't think it mattered. I hear that Cam's story is next in this series. I can't wait to read his story too!
B00004VXF2|5.0|People who rate this album 1 star have not heard of La Monte Young, they have not heard The Theater of Eternal Music, they shrug John Cage off as stupid, they are uninformed about electroacoustic music, they are mute toward the 20th century avant garde or even post modernism, they have not experienced noise, their attention span is by far too small to appreciate drone, they have little appreciation or understanding for artistic statements existing outside of a industry existing for the sole purpose of making money from music and not for releasing true art, they want to stay comfortable and safe listening to what an industry wants them to consume, their ears and aural synapses experience atrophy, they don't experiment, they don't like free jazz, they believe that Lou Reed's poetry only exists on one plane and in my opinion, are completely missing the point of this piece, they are completely missing out on other types of music and consequently new modes of thinking.
006135323X|5.0|As a college student with very little time for extra reading, I really enjoyed Predictably Irrational and found it hard to put down.

It was very accessible and thought provoking.

B0012K1ILW|4.0|J Dilla is no longer here to contribute to the Badu sound. This why this cd suffers. The only song that sounds warm and fuzzy on this project is the Dilla inspired Telephone - how ironic. Understand the significance of J Dilla not being on this project. Understand the significance of Common's project not being a gem due to Dilla's absence. J Dilla was the hub and the other artist are the spokes such as Q-Tip, Badu, D'angelo, Talib Kweli, James Poyser, Common, Slum Village, Questlove, and not to mention his influence on Dwele and Madlib. Now about this cd...    The average rating for this project was 4 stars at the time of this review. Keep this in mind - this is a 2 cd release. The first cd will not be like the second cd. The part one release is the hip hop version - she has 2 songs that mentions the greatest hip hop producer of all time - J Dilla (with Madlib as the 2nd best producer of all-time). Telephone and the Madlib produced The Healer mention J Dilla. I'm sure the second cd release will be totally different than the part one release. She does not want 2 cds that sound alike. SA RA, Karriem Riggins, Madlib, and 9th Wonder are hip hop producers for the most part. On the second cd release she will probably have more James Poyser, ?uestlove, Pino Palladino, and Bilal Oliver. So we must really rate this cd based on both releases and not just the first one although the first cd is all we have to go on right now. Just wait for cd #2 and see the picture in it's totality. This cd is fast and shifty and shows the hip hop influence on Erykah. The second cd will probably have gems in the same bane as Green Eyes or Next Lifetime. Don't condemn Erykah or this project until you hear the 2nd cd. Only then will you fully appreciate this first cd release. SHALOM.
B0011MRKHW|5.0|it's good movie and you won't upset to seen. Also it's touching and proud.  The Elizabeth Story was historical and learning from old war. I like the sound of music. You will enjoy the movie until the end.
B0012K1ILW|1.0|i dont know what to write really....i love E. Badu. ive been a fan since '97. i love her originality, i love the love that she has for the seventies era...that's me all the way. im an early 70's baby and im cut from the same exact cloth...i dig, recognize, and acknowledge with all love her flow. she implements her respect for the greatest artists of our time and before our time in her music and videos. Honey is the highlight here. the video is beautiful. i even dig the beginning of the album w/the old school blaxploitation movie trailer voice and the music that was jammin after that. but....that's it man. im tired of the deepness being too deep that you can't even swim back up to shore to take a breather man. i know what she is implementing on this album - and i dig it.....but enough is enough and too much is just too d*** much. it's unneccessary. you can make your point as far as what you believe in without all this stuff.
B0011NVC98|2.0|The movie opens with a feast scene taking place by firelight in a communal hall, and I was immediately reminded of the feast scene in the 1958 movie \\"The Vikings\\" in which Kirk Douglas and Ernest Borgnine were chewing up the scenery, to much better effect.<br /><br />Here we had great actors such as Anthony Hopkins showing about as much expressive subtlety as Cabbage Patch Dolls.<br /><br />I can't think of any reason to have made this whole movie in CGI other than as a conceit. Gumbi meets Sasquatch.<br /><br />This could have been a terrific movie; instead it was simply a computer role-playing game like Neverwinter Nights. The actors were totally wasted.<br /><br />The other movie this reminded me of was the 1981 Michael Crichton sci-fi thriller \\"Looker\\", in which beautiful models were being \\"scanned\\" into computer files so they could be inserted later into commercials and TV shows without having to actually \\"appear\\" in person. What was a very novel sci-fi idea in 1981 has now become a sad and unsuccessful reality.<br /><br />Computer capability of portraying the true subtlety of good acting has a very long way to go yet.
B000002GW5|5.0|Great Album from a great artist. Highlights include The Title Track , \\"Rosie \\" , \\" Nothin' But Time \\" , \\" The Load Out / Stay \\", \\" Love Needs a Heart \\" and \\" Cocaine \\" . I reccommend the DVD Audio version if you have a player . It features 2 Bonus tracks , \\" Cocaine Revisited \\" and an instrumental . Nice CD to pop in when taking a road trip . Not a weak track on it.
0060512806|5.0|A friend of mine gave me a copy of this book for Christmas.  I'd never heard of the writer, but John recommended it strongly.  I sat down expecting a romping science fiction book.  What I got instead was an epic tale of two families from World War II through modern day (late 90's, some of the technology is a tiny bit dated) and all over the globe from England to Scandinavia to the Philippines, to Japan to the high seas in almost every hemisphere to a British protectorate country that Stephenson invented out of whole cloth that sounded so plausible I had to look it up on the Internet to make sure it didn't really exist.    It involves cryptology all the way from England against the Nazi's through very complex security for the Internet and, of all things, card games.  The people are all amazing, diverse, human, complex and fully realized.      As many people have said, it ends rather abruptly, but the journey that leads up to that ending is so well worth traveling, I really don't care.  This is a book that will go on my \\"read again and again\\" shelf, right next to Dalaney's Dahlgren.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Their first and in my opinion their best. Not a weak track on the album. My favorite tracks are \\" Water of Love \\" , \\" Down To The Waterline \\" and \\"Six Blade Knife \\" . As time goes by , I've probably considered all of the tracks the best of the album at one time or another . Get the remastered version . The group got a little \\"poppy\\" throughout the years . Kind of wished they stayed in this mode during their career. You'll see Mark Knopfler return to this style on most of his solo work .   Highly reccommend \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" in addition to this for all Knopfler fans.
B0012K1ILW|2.0|I'm a big Erykah Badud fan and after the amazing music that Erykah put together on Worldwide Underground I was expecting New Amerykah to be a classic album. But this album just isn't that good. It's by far her worst album. I'm all for pushing limits of music but when it's wack it's wack. Erykah is much better live then on recording. And this album shows that a lot.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|Tremendous movie that makes you think . Aaron Eckhart is great as Nick Naylor. Need to listen to the movie. Don't be distracted while watching this or you'll miss many important points. Enjoy the expression on Katie Holmes as Nick \\"outs\\" her.
B00000254Q|4.0|I enjoy this album for it's repetitive nature. It makes a great driving album. Sure, it's not his best stuff. Heck, Carlos is only credited with writing two tracks on the album. But, the tracks are catchy and will have you singing along in no time.
B0011NVC9I|1.0|I went right out to buy this the day it came out. Liking the cast and director I was hoping for a movie similar to 300. What I got was Shrek 3. I was under the impression computer animation was talking about the effects used in the movie not an entire movie made on it. My misunderstanding is my loss. I would have never bought it knowing it was a cartoon. Sure call it computer animated, it is still a cartoon. I turned it off after 5 minutes and put it in my dvd collection right next to the Shrek and baby einstein DVD's. I will probably never watch it again. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY...
B000ZK4466|5.0|The Mars Volta is the best band ever.  If Cedric made an album singing Christmas Carols, I would buy it and I would love it the same.  However..... Amazon f#*&ed up.  I pre-ordered this album anxiously awaiting it's release.  Well I didn't receive the album until a week after the release date.  So much for pre-ordering.  I ended up buying it on iTunes because I was impatient, so I paid for the album twice.  Thanks alot Amazon!  Meg
B000JBWWBK|5.0|Complete renditions of songs that were played either in full or in part in the movie...a lot better than the shorter clips.  Makes for a very enjoyable and uplifting listening experience.
B000VLOKQI|5.0|Anyone familiar with rock 'n roll knows the Who. But in some ways, I think their contributions and creative standing are a little under appreciated. This documentary has all kinds of great insight into the band with firsthand accounts of their exploits and creative process. If you're a fan, get it. If you're a curious fan of the history of rock music, it's just as interesting.
0765357151|4.0|Fantastic book, Richard really pulls off a great story of struggle.  Also includes several other short stories, which are also great.
B00111YM5G|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in quite a while. It's dark, gritty, action-packed, but the action doesn't distract from the great story. I especially loved that it didn't shy away from using actual biblical angel names instead of making up something to avoid offending anyone. This movie can be watched on many levels: just for the surface story or for the deeper view of humanity, good, and evil through the eyes of the main character, Gabriel. Either way, it's a great movie for all angel fans or really anyone up for a dark action movie with a good story.
B000ICM5VW|5.0|I have watched this movie about 10 times now.  Just like when I was a kid and could not get enough of the original King Kong I can't get enough of this one.  Peter Jackson did a superb job on every level in this film.  From the re-creation of the era to the actors and the special effects it can't be beat.<br />  The extended version is even better if you like long movies like I do.  I can only hope that Peter Jackson will continue to make films like this.  They seem to be getting few and far between these days.  The hd-dvd version is really nice.
B000OFGYDS|5.0|Review of:  \\"Good to Great - Why Some Companies Make the Leap ... and Others Don't\\"<br /><br />By:  Jim Collins<br /><br />The book \\"Good to Great\\" is a report on the results of a lengthy business research study.  Jim Collins and a team of researchers asked the question: \\"Why do some companies make the leap from being good companies to being great companies, and why not others?\\"  Over the course of the book this foundational question is asked several different ways.<br /><br />In chapter eight of \\"Good to Great\\" the author says that the fundamental question a CEO should ask is: \\"What can we do better than any other company in the world, that fits our economic denominator and that we have passion for?\\" (Page 180)<br /><br />In chapter nine of \\"Good to Great\\" the author introspectively asked what motivated him to undertake the huge project in the first place.  His motivation was to understand man's search for meaning, in his own words:  \\"... why greatness ... the search for meaning, or more precisely, the search for meaningful work.\\" (Page 208)<br /><br />Jim Collins' previous book, \\"Built to Last\\" (NS) is a description of sustained greatness in American companies.  After publishing \\"Built to Last\\" the author asked how companies got to be great in the first place.  \\"Good to Great\\" answers that question.<br /><br />Book Summary<br /><br />Jim Collins and a team of twenty researchers studied the difference between companies that are good and companies that become great.  The definition of greatness was made in very practical terms.  A great company yields a sustained high return to the owners.  For this research a high yield was seven times the general stock market over a fifteen-year period.  The study took 10 ½ years of researcher effort and resulted in 2,000 pages of interview transcripts.<br /><br />The change from \\"good to great\\" is guided by, what the author calls, a level five leader.  The common characteristics of level five leaders are:  modesty, humility, willfulness, courage and company orientation.  Level five leaders are unselfish.<br /><br />Executive compensation plans don't matter between good and great companies.  The important thing is that they are reasonable and fair.  Executive compensation has to make sense, but will not move a company from \\"good to great\\".<br /><br />Great companies place more emphasis on character than on skills, education, special knowledge or work experience.  Skills can be taught.<br /><br />Great companies are tough places to work.  Great companies are rigorous, but not ruthless.  Managers and employees are held to high standards.  Standards are ferocious and consistent.  Great companies seldom have cost cutting layoffs, but underperformers are fired.<br /><br />Practical disciplines for being rigorous rather than ruthless:<br />1. When in doubt, don't hire - keep looking.  Place tremendous emphasis on finding the right people.<br />2. When you know you need to make a people change, act instead of delay.  If you feel the need to tightly manage someone, you've made a hiring mistake.  Do not hire a lot of people and keep the best.<br />3. Put your best people on the best opportunities and not the biggest problems.<br /><br />Breakthrough results come about by a series of good decisions, diligently executed and accumulated, one on top of another.  Start with an honest and diligent effort to determine the truth of the current situation.  The right decisions often become self-evident.  You absolutely cannot make good decisions without first confronting the brutal truth.<br /><br />Four principles of creating an atmosphere where the truth is heard:<br />1. Lead with questions, not answers.<br />2. Engage in dialog and debate, not coercion.<br />3. Conduct autopsies without blame.  With the right people it's not necessary to assign blame, but only to search for understanding and learning.<br />4. Build red flag mechanisms.<br /><br />Organize the entire world into simple ideas.  All the \\"goodto great\\" companies had simple strategies.  The simple strategy guided all their actions.<br /><br />The simple strategic concepts come from three ideas:<br />1. Discover what the company can be best in the world at.  Focus on this world-class strength.<br />2. Use insight into what drives your economic engine.  Determine what single thing dominates profit and cash flow.<br />3. Decide what you are deeply passionate about.<br /><br />Just because you have done something for a long time doesn't mean you can be best in the world.<br /><br />A culture of discipline<br />1. Build a culture of freedom and responsibility within a framework.<br />2. Fill the culture with self disciplined people willing to go to extreme lengths to fulfill their responsibility.<br />3. Don't confuse discipline with being a tyrannical disciplinarian.<br />4. Exercise focus.<br /><br />Freedom and responsibility together allow management to manage the system and not the people.  People in great companies go to great extremes to fulfill their responsibilities, bordering on fanaticism.  Interview and secondary sources made continual use of words like disciplined, dogged, rigorous, determined, diligent, precise, fastidious, systematic, methodical, workmanlike, demanding, consistent, focused, accountable and responsible.<br /><br />The fact that something is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is irrelevant unless it fits into the corporate focus.<br /><br />On the use of technology, the author quotes Bertrand Russell:  \\"Men would rather die than think, many do.\\"  Technology, when used correctly, is an accelerator of momentum and not a creator of momentum.<br /><br />Personal reaction to \\"Good to Great\\"<br /><br />This entire study is just the sort of thing a statistician is trained and inclined to do.  It was highly dependent on good experimental design, data collection and statistical technique.<br /><br />Most readers want to be level five leaders and will see some of the traits in themselves.  Most readers will realize that they are not yet there.<br /><br />Jim Collins found quite a list of differences between his great companies and typical companies.  In my opinion the most important difference is in leadership.  The one most obvious difference between the two types of companies is the magnanimity of their leaders.  Company executives usually rise within an organization by personal ambition.  A level five leader makes the company great for the enhancement of the company, not for personal gain.<br /><br />This book forces the reader to confront realities.  Some common uncomfortable realities are:<br />- Most hiring policies will not get a company from good to great.  Most hiring is based too much on skill and not enough on character.  The level five leader needs to find people with the passion for the business.<br />- Focus is crucial and every leader knows it.  However, many of us still allow ouryselfs to take on projects for reasons that seem good at the time and bad later.  I call these projects one-off projects.  They always take on far more energy and resources (especially time) than expected at the start.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|First, let me disclose that I'm a 48 yr old female. I picked up this (then obscure) movie -- and put it back down again -- a good 3 or 4 times in the video store before finally renting it. And thank God I finally did so. We watched the rental three times (never do that) then bought the DVD.. then the soundtrack.. then their other CD (The Swell Season).. then 'The Cost' by the Frames (his other band). Then came the awards.. Indy Spirit, Oscar. Seems I'm not the only one who had Fallen Quickly in love with this music! Glen Hansard's voice reminds me of Dave Matthews/Cat Stevens and Richie Haven's all in one. Marketa is just delightful. I can honestly say there isn't a song between all 3 CD's that I don't love or at the very least like a great deal. Today I scored tickets to see them live! Once is hardly enuough for me!
B00005YU1O|5.0|A movie that looks at the more interesting, magical (for lack of a better word) side of life.
B000244FDW|3.0|Both versions are worth watching, mainly for the contrast they provide. This will repeat other reviewers to some degree.    BBC - Faithful to the book in lifestyle and pacing, and in the presentation of careful and restrained manners.  Bennet sisters do look as though they belong together, though the Bingley sisters do not.  But, and it's a big but:  Many of the performances are wooden or shallow.  Elizabeth lacks the wit and sparkle of the book, and says teasing lines seriously.  Darcy tries so hard to be supercilious that he removes all life and intelligence from the character.  Mrs. Bennet appears to walk on a stage and deliver memorized lines rather than inhabit her character, and she is fluffy and shallow rather than extremely silly (an interpretation which a viewer might prefer).  Lydia never does anything embarassing or shocking till we are told she has run off. We don't see seriously egregious behavior from anyone that would offend Darcy. The best performances are the ones which are terribly flawed in the A&E version:  Caroline Bingley here is pretty, elegant, and very catty.  Collins is perfect, exactly the combination of obsequiousness and self-importance Austen described.  And Mary Bennet is also believable as a girl who is trying hard to be spiritual and elevated above her sisters. One other flaw:  they added a lot of extra scenes with Charlotte Lucas/Collins which weren't really necessary and far more intrusive than the very small additions that A&E did.     A&E - Very beautiful movie. Almost all of the secondary characters are over-played, but we felt that actually helped the viewer catch Austen's intentions, because a viewer has to apprehend the character without the advantage of going back to re-read. Collins and Caroline Bingley are really poorly done, injecting cartoon qualities that interrupt the flow of others' good acting. But this version has a big advantage in that all the actors threw themselves into their parts, and seem believable (except for the two above). We really prefer this interpretation of Elizabeth and Darcy, because while not overdone, they are understandable.  She is witty, self-assured, and laughing at everyone.  Darcy, a very difficult character to pull off, comes off much as Austen describes:  haughty but intelligent, and fascinated by Elizabeth.  And we forgive A&E for having him swim on his own property in defiance of the book. So, in spite of the over-acting, we like the A& E version very much.
0967175429|5.0|This book contains a healing technique that is very effective. By using meditation one is able to connect with God and facilitate healing.  Good reading for those interested in healing work,and those new to healing and meditation.  Vianna Stibal did an excellent job in sharing her techniques and knowledge. I could not put the book down, once I started reading.   I highly recommend this book.    Thanks,    Franklyn Holder

B0013D8LOU|4.0|There is only 1 reason and 1 reason alone why this movie works- Johnny Depp. He transformed this film from an ordinary bland musical to a superbly acted bloodbath extravaganza. I don't personally have a problem with musicals; some work, some don't. Sweeney Todd actually isn't that great of a musical. Some numbers were pretty catchy and fun, but others just flew past my head without a second thought. However, because the actors really put their heart and soul into this, and you can tell they did, the movie actually comes off as pretty great. For what it is, it works. All the actors do an extremely fine job with their roles and it all comes off very realistic. Alan Rickman, a perfection of a man, does a great, yet subtle job here as the sort of evil Judge. His scenes with Depp are thrilling and suspenseful. The only minor gripe I have is with Helena Bonham Carter. She is an excellent actress, and this is no exception, but she does an only mediocre job as a vocalist. She is the weakest link in the film. But it is not a big offender to truly turn you away.     The set pieces, the costumes, they are all exquisite and fit the mood of this gloomy movie perfectly. It is actually quite a bloody and violent film, so even though its categorized as a musical, I would not let young children watch this. It's pretty gruesome at times. But that is also the great thing about this film. Its almost nonchalant about the whole murder issue. It almost feels as if you shouldn't take it seriously. Its sort of fun actually. If you love Tim Burton, this is a perfect film for you, musical lover or not. Quite a few people had the audacity to actually leave 5 minutes into this film in the theaters after realising that it is in fact a musical. Don't people actually research movies before going to see them?
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|I personally am extremely interested in this time in History and I think that this movie is a great look into the past. The details in creating their world are fantastic and Blanchet does a wonderful job making Elizabeth come to life. If you liked the first movie, you are going to love this one.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Having never listened to any of the so-called \\"new age\\" punk (I'm stuck in the late 90's Jawbreakers, Hot Water Musics, Avails, etc) I wasn't familiar with Rise Against until I heard one of their songs on an internet radio station.      All I have to say is holy crap.  This album is easily one of the best I've ever heard.  I can't believe it's intensity, each song a sing-a-long.  Every song is great.  Buy this.
0321525655|3.0|I found Presentation Zen disappointing. It seemed to violate in writing style many of the principles it seeks to correct in slide design, reading more like a meandering conversation over drinks than a well-laid-out, step-by-step primer. For example, the book was frustratingly repetitive, with even the simplest points restated through multiple chapters (really, how many times do you have to suggest using post-it notes?). Some central points came and went quietly in sidebars, and others completely lacked explanation or justification (i.e. the rule for using six words maximum per slide). Every time I thought I was about to discover a new and enlightening concrete principle of visual design with valid reasoning, it seemed the point from the previous chapter was repeated instead. Moreover, exceptions or alternate approaches also weren't considered, such as times when using a whopping seven words on a slide might be useful, or when more complex slide builds and transitions could help an audience grasp a concept. In addition, many of the points made in the book, such as the value of \\"taking risks,\\" seemed obvious and trite.     Overall, like many tedious slide shows I've endured, I felt the book could have been half as long and made its points with the same clarity, and would have showed more respect for the reader's time. To its credit, it does offer some useful ideas on slide design, and some excellent graphic examples. It's also visually appealing, with beautiful slide reprints, tons of \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" examples to learn from, and cleanly-designed pages. Still, I'd trade the appealing design for tighter, more solid, more useful content.
B000002BVN|5.0|Michael Jackson's \\"Blood On The Dance Floor\\" album was released back in 1997 and contained 5 new songs and 8 remixes of songs from the \\"History\\" album. The 5 new songs on this album are fantastic. The first single \\"Blood On The Dance Floor\\" is fantastic! With having zero promotion it managed to hit #1 in the UK and #42 in the US. The songs \\"Ghosts\\" and \\"Is It Scary\\" are very similar to each other but are very good. The video for \\"Ghosts\\" is one the best videos I have ever seen before. The other two songs \\"Morphine\\" and \\"Superfly Sister\\" are amazing. I also do like some of the remixes on the album, the History remix is amazing and as well as the Stranger In Moscow remix. The \\"Blood On The Dance Floor\\" album became the best selling remix ever without having any promotion. The album has sold over 6 million copies worldwide and 1.2 million copies in the US. I would recommend this to you, even if your not into remixes, the 5 new songs on this album are well worth the purchase.
0143038419|5.0|Take the time to read this book - especially if you find that work is consuming you and running your life, you have ever been through a divorce or a relationship that was toxic, or you just seem to \\"always be searching.\\" This will help you realize it's all up to you - and although you are painfully jealous that Liz has been PAID to have this year of personal exploration, you will be so glad she shared it with you.
0393307050|5.0|Master and Commander introduces the Jack Aubrey/Stephen Maturin seafaring series, which takes place during the Napoleanic Wars. It tells the story of the developing friendship between Jack and Stephen. It portrays life aboard a war ship, describing the conditions, expectations, hardships and attitudes in the kind of detail a landlubber such as Stephen would need. While there are a couple of battles, particularly toward the end, most of the action comprises setting the stage for what will come.    O'Brian is a master storyteller whose command of the English language ranks among the best I have ever read. He uses an old writing style, which I believe is intentional; it sets the stage for the early 18th Century-late 19th Century. I have never encountered so many words new to me in a single book. But rather than distract from the story, this challenged my mind.    I found the author's dry wit highly entertaining. One of the reasons I'll read the book again is that I'm sure I missed a lot of his subtle humor. For example, in one scene, Jack is writing a letter to his superiors, who he wants to impress. In it, he uses the word, \\"insidious,\\" when he means \\"invidious.\\" In another scene, he refers to the Catalan language as a \\"putain\\" when he means a \\"patois.\\" Putain is Spanish for something several degrees coarser than the word, hooker.    I'll admit that a lot of the naval lingo - although explained - went over, or out of, my head. I just don't care which part of the ship is the stern or bow, how many guns it has, or which way the wind is blowing. Keel is a verb that means to faint and poop is something you scoop off the sidewalk when you walk your dog. But never, ever did I feel like I was being lectured.    Master and Commander is a riveting story. It's funny, informative and entertaining - all at the same time.    Highly recommended, especially for readers who prefer action/adventure and an intellectual challenge.

B0007CNXUK|5.0|I grew up loving Peter Pan. Learning more about the author, James M Barrie, only makes me more of an advocate for the novel, play, stage musical, animated feature, and film. Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors and this venue is his best work to date. A great film for adults who can still remember being young.
1569242739|5.0|When they have to tear down my bedroom wall to rescue me from my house, I'm going to sue the writers of this book.     Really though, everything is fab and totally passable for non-vegan types, so they're great for parties! They're really not difficult either, which is always nice.     Love it!
B000002A3T|2.0|Sorry guys, I got an iPod for Christmas and have been slowly loading hundreds of CD's into it and listened to this one again the other day.  I picture the pre-recording session meetings going like this:    Gilmour:  Ok, what do we need to make an album sound like Pink Floyd?  Anyone?    Mason:  We need cool sounds  Wright:  And lush sonic landscapes  Gilmour:  Great!  Let's go into the studio!    Some of this album is ok but when I stumbled across the lyric that says \\"the rain fell on the roofs of uncertainty\\" I had to stop.  Gilmour is a great guitarist and has shared songwriting credits on some of Pink Floyd's finest songs (Dogs, Wish You Were Here, Comfortably Numb, etc) but he cannot carry the creative weight himself.    Pink Floyd, like other great bands (the Stones come to mind) is more than just the sum of its parts.  To excel, it requires the collaboration of Waters and Gilmour (or Jagger and Richards).  Otherwise it's mostly going through the motions.  Those motions can produce some occasional high points but cannot sustain an entire album.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|tight interesting and great music, reminds me of Queen 10CC and even Deep Purple but with enough of their own style to be well worth having in any record collection
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|It is nice to see a classic series presented in such an attractive and useful format.  The included book, while not necessary, is a nice addition to the disks themselves, which are also very well produced.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|LOVE (CD + Audio DVD)  The sequence of grand classical Beatles music, both words and tunes, have been put together with sublime technical skill. The result is breathtaking for the ears. Did think some video on the DVD would have been available but I guess the video of LOVE The Beatles can be purchased separately. So all in all the CD is brilliant! Purchase and shipping from Amazon was spot-on, in a word excellent. Haydn Deane, Australia.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This is one of the greatest films I've ever had the opportunity to watch. It's classified as \\"fiction\\" but should be reclassified as \\"prophecy\\". The movie had more than great acting, cinematography, and storyline but it also has (and will continue to have)great relevance. The parallels between the film and reality are truly freighting at times. As a fan of the graphic novel I was disappointed V's political ideologies were purged and the government made far less tyrannical in it's actions.    The performances given by Weaving and Portman are tremendous.For a man whose true face is hidden beneath a mask you feel greater emotion coming from V than you would most unmasked men.    The greatest success of the film is warning it sends to its viewers: unlike most thins in life if you ignore your freedom it will go away.
B000025IIN|5.0|This Classic album is awsome simply put. Every song is a delight, of course there is the timeless HERO that cannot be beat, its one of the most amazing songs of all time, and ANYTIME YOU NEED A FRIEND both of which are so inspirational and uplifting. Listening to this album when your down can make everything feel like it will be okay! The lead single DREAMLOVER is another classic that is still played on radio today 15 years later! Two more of my favs are ALL I'VE EVER WANTED & MUSIC BOX. Last but not least my absolute fav song on this album is WITHOUT YOU. Mariah makes this song her own and her vocals are as always amazing but I think especially in this song. Its beautiful! This is Mariah's masterpiece & classic, its also her best selling record and a album everyone should own!
B00028HBKM|2.0|There is one incredible scene in this movie - a scene that perhaps makes the entire movie worth the price.  It is the scene in which Jesus is finishing building a table and bouncing on it while have a friendly conversation with his mother.  In that scene one can see a Jesus of love, humanity, and compassion not evident in the gross misinterpretations of the Bible that have come to commandeer his name.  It is a glimpse of what the real Jesus might have been like - learning the wisdom of the ancients as he emerged from childhood through his lost years until returning to the Bible at thirty.    The rest of the movie is pretty awful.  It had no character development - the king of a religious sect getting beaten senseless does not a good movie make.  Anyone raised Christian will see nothing but the same old tired interpretations, essentially reinforcing the status quo without a thought of its actual validity.
B0012K1ILW|3.0|This album pushes the limit of being experimental. It is very different in many aspects from her past albums but it isn't a terrible release. What is really dope about this album is she is singing about revolution. In Soldier she sings in the hook \\"If you think about turning back, I got the shotgun for your back\\". Big shout out to Harriet Tubman!! Some of the beats are dope and some are strange. It will depend on your musical taste if you think they are strange or not. I guess the biggest gripe I have with the album is on some songs I don't like the delivery nor the way she sings on the songs. All in all this isn't the best release from Ms Badu, but its worth a listen.<br /><br />Standout tracks<br />Honey<br />Soldier<br />That hump
B000P6YNSE|4.0|Finally the 3rd season of lost, a little disappointed with how the story going hope the fourth season gets better.
0525948023|1.0|Simply enough, Tolle's book is so attractive and popular because it removes the distractng reminder of a God who loves us enough to die for us, but who also loves us too much to acquiesce when we deliberately choose to spend Eternity apart from Him. Follow Tolle's philosophy and you'll break the second commandment; namely, you'll make a god in your own image (yours!) God wants for us what Tolle's book supposedly offers, but He is the only one who can get us there.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|I've listened to this album about nine times through since I got it today from a local record shop (PLEASE SUPPORT YOUR OWN!), yet the conception of it is beautiful. The songs are great too. Much of the production is split in between MadLib and Sa-Ra Creative Productions. If you have the ability look at the cover art and the rest of the art used in the cover, the issues she tackles are relevant to the times. I appreciated her work in this album very much.
B0012K1ILW|2.0|This album is just OKAY....what happened to the jazzy, bluesy Erykah that we all fell in love with....this album is a good funk or I should say funkish album, it is 1000000 times better than her last effort, but still not quite to par....or up to the standards of her first two albums.  Check it out, but don't expect much and you may just like it.
B00111YM5G|5.0|This dark, orginally unknown film is building a growing, enthusiastic  following outside of its cult, low budget origins. Shot in the tradition of The Crow, Highlander and Sin City, it has an artsy, comic book appeal. Excellent production qualities, lighting and sets belie its tiny, independent film budget.       This is fantasy-horror stuff, and it takes awhile to get into the twisted apocolyptic world that the characters inhabit. However, the strong acting and near perfect casting soon grips you into this strong and mystical morality tale.      A truly remarkable find in film making, especially noteworthy coming from a group of relative unknowns from Australia. A great add to your collection.
0374280967|4.0|Beyond the Fringe alumnus, playwright (the History Boys) and novelist, Alan Bennett has written a perfect little book about what happens when someone becomes a voracious reader. In this case the queen herself, Elizabeth II, happens upon a mobile library (that would be a bookmobile on this side of the pond) while chasing after her infamous Corgis and so begins her journey into literature. The Uncommon Reader, a novella shows the inside workings of the palace, the protocol, the State Dinners, the daily duties of the Royal Family of which the Queen begins to tire. She becomes so involved in reading one book after another that she waves absent-mindedly from her limousine while reading a book on her lap; she no longer cares if she wears an outfit or accessory twice in row and most distressingly she begins to ask people what they are reading rather than sticking to the approved script of, \\"Did you come far?\\" \\"Did you find parking?\\" and so on.<br /><br />I highly recommend this gem of a book for anyone who knows the joys of bibliomania.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Good lord who could have released this cd without noticing how badly it  sounds ??  The actual cd content wise is terrific but it is horrible to listen to.  I bought it twice thinking I had a bad copy.    Oh how the quality of recordings has declined..  me coming from the 50's listening to my little 45's..  heck they sounded better than this.    But again back to the actual songs..I love em !
B000LSAJ3O|5.0|Unbelievably great. Simply the best playing in the popular genre that anyone will ever hear. Forget the less than maximum stars from some reviewers. They have no clue. Great video. Great audio. Fabulous playing. A must have.<br />As for the one idiot who bought this thinking it was a standards DVD. Jesus: 'nuff said! The other person who wanted all their 'hits'. Forget it. Any true musicians want to continue to evolve and progress. This is fabulous. Don't be put off by cloth-eared cretins!
0316067598|5.0|This book was extremely well written. Luttrell did an amazing job at describing the environment and the people involved in the \\"story.\\" It is a gut-wrenching and pivoting tale of the forging of one Patriot into a SEAL, and an account of the many professional Operators whom lost their lives that one fateful day defending this nation. If you are into war, history, strategy, and combat-related readings, I highly recommend Lone Survivor. It should be recommended reading for students at public/private educational institutions since it presents a modern first-hand perspective on war and the respect that our Armed Forces have earned and deserve. It is certainly more useful than drab history text books that cover entire wars/conflicts in a few paragraphs.<br /><br />Luttrell does not interrupt the rhythm with in-depth details ad nauseam ala Tom Clancy, but he does provide enough information so that the reader isn't completely lost. For example, he describes how he added 3 extra magazines to his standard loadout, his Oakley Assault Boots, the Mk 12 Mod 0 rifle with PEQ-4 and sound suppressor, and the position of the Taliban as his team is regrouping down the mountainside. A Clancy novel would have filled no less than 5 chapters detailing the luster of the moly-dry film coating on the Mk 12 receivers, the durometer of the Oakley Assault boot soles, etc... The book was also published before Lt. Mike Murphy was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.
0440238153|5.0|I am glad that I stuck with the series, the first two books were at times tedious but the wonder and magic of this last book was almost too much to bear. I wish I could have read it when I was a kid because I read so much other dark stuff and this book was just filled with hope and love.

B000O75F7C|5.0|This stereo CD was my first PT purchase. I was not able to really get into the stero mix of this album, not that I didn't like it, but it just never \\"grabbed\\" me. On a whim, I purchased the surround mix from their website for under $20 with shipping. All I can say is this CD takes on an entire different persona in 5.1 surround sound. Talk about grabbing you, it totally pulls you in and holds you for the full 50 or so minutes with no letting go. This CD will take you everywhere.    You simply have not heard this CD as it was meant to be until you have heard the 5.1 surround version. It is as though it was born to be a surround mix and the stereo version is just a \\"watered down\\" wanna be.     This is one of the few CDs that will make full use of your audio equipment. It is VERY dynamic and has a HUGE soundstage. It is one (If not the best) surround CD available, period. I retract that hesitation, it is the best surround CD available without question (That I have heard). These guys really know how to bring out the best of the 5.1 music format. Kudos, props, thanks or whatever you want to call it to PT for the 5.1 version of this CD. A real treat to enjoy. This album engineering rates right up there with Alan Parsons work on Pink Floyd - Dark Side Of The Moon.
1573229725|4.0|well...this book was wonderfully atmospheric (or maybe i'm just partial to mid-1800s london). it is divided into three parts, and i most enjoyed the first, and its narrator, sue. although the plot became a little convoluted and often dragged, the writing more than made up for the deficiencies.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|Robert Zemeckis, like James Cameron, likes to use special effects only to help support the story rather than the effects becoming the showpiece. Well, he used to be anyway since, aside from Cast Away, he seemed more focused on advancing the technology but not really worrying if the story's badly written, sluggish or just not emotionally involving. Case in point: The Polar Express, which was a beautiful looking film which suffered from zombie-looking eyes and stiff movements. Beowulf is at least more story-centered but it's still not as involving, even with all the flash and pop.    A creature named Grendel has been terrorizing a village and small kingdom and they ask for a hero to come and slay the monster. In comes Beowulf, a legendary hero who's not humble and noble but almost overconfident. With the King wanting the creature dead and the Queen showing affection for Beowulf, he must slay any demons that come his way and possibly deal with his own.    The process used to make Beowulf is a more advanced version of \\"motion capture\\" which essentially puts actors in a suit filled with small balls that many cameras read and scan into computer and make a digital model of you so whatever you do, your digital you does as well. That gives CG animators freedom to have whatever kind of character model, whether creature, strong, alien over the performance you give. But after the Polar Express, the aim was more photorealistic but met with criticisms such as rather soulless-looking eyes and stiff movements, particularly in the face.     Beowulf has even more advanced detail and realism but there's still something...\\"off\\" about it, like you can just tell it's not right. Either they just wanted a different look to live action or duplicate it I don't know but it's hard to completely immerse yourself into the film since you're constantly going \\"that looks like Angelina Jolie but....not\\". Then again, the story's not really involving and doesn't really have a narrative drive to it with the climax just happening without much buildup (it's not just a problem with men but apparently movies about heroes as well I guess). Gone are the days of Back to the Future and Roger Rabbit where the visuals helped support the narrative; now it seems like it doesn't matter what narrative it is as long as it gives them a chance to use the visuals.    I'd recommend seeing Beowulf mainly for the visuals alone, especially if you have an HD-equipped television and you can go up to 1080i or even the HD-DVD version. Other than that, don't look for a good film, just a good looking one.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|At this point you can take this new cd and put it along side   Radiohead's four other masterpieces. Being a Radiohead person,  you know for what I speak. There is just no one else on the planet  that is doing music like this with such confidence. Radiohead  challenges the listener. They can demand certain things from you.  It is almost as if your dimension shifts just a little....and you  are taken away by the sound.
B0011ETNXE|4.0|[[VIDEOID:18718771]]This second re-issue Thriller of is a better re-issue than the [[ASIN:B00005QGAZ 2001 Special Edition]]. Even this [[ASIN:B0011ETNXE vinyl record]] has beeter quality than the [[ASIN:B00005QGAZ 2001 Special Edition CD]]. And having the [[ASIN:B0011ETNXE vinyl record]] release really gives the album a more 80's feeling when it's played. I still find the release a tad lacking. It is missing \\"Can't get Outta The Rain\\" Which appeared on side 2/B of the 45 release of [[ASIN:B0013DA95O Billie Jean]] and \\"Got the hots\\" (Which is appearing on the [[ASIN:B00122DUNE Japan Release]]). Those 2 tracks should have been added. I wouldn't be surprised if the album has a 30th anniversary edition 5 years later with those 2 songs adeed. Also, The Kanye West Remix of [[ASIN:B0013G1HVQ Billie Jean]] was a tad disappointing. Kanye gave the song a great new beat but I was hoping to get a rap verse out of him on the track. The Fergie remix to [[ASIN:B0013G2SVY Beat It]] wasn't too bad either. I have nothing against Fergie but I think that P!nk would have been a better choice for the song. Anyways, Like I said, this is a big improvement from the [[ASIN:B00005QGAZ 2001 Special Edition]] for the sound quality. The Interviews on that edition are better bonus features. I think it's well worth getting for the better sound quality. But even though I found the DVD in the [[ASIN:B000WS4QJG CD release]] lacking, it would have been nice to be included with this vinyl record. With it's Gatefold Jacket case, the dvd could have been easilly added in away from the vinyl discs.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|A friend introduced me to Sufjan Stevens, and I'm so glad she did: from the very first track, this CD is quietly addictive.  It's been a long time since I've found a CD I could enjoy from beginning to end, that is mellow enough to be background music yet not at all depressing (a la Nick Drake or Elliot Smith).  Stevens has a pretty voice (yes, he's a guy, but you'll see what I mean) which he accompanies beautifully with harmonies and guitar. I'll look forward to many replays of this CD and to hearing not just the melodies, but the lyrical stories they each tell.
0553801503|5.0|I give it 5 stars because the series is great .... but the wait between books is unfairly miserable. I'm sure with as many people that have invested in the ongoing story ... come on, write already.
1400064287|5.0|Get this book!  This book is fantastic.  The main points are spot on, with numerous additional insights throughout.  It gives great techniques to follow with compelling examples, but is much more powerful than a typical self-help book because it also gives insight into why and how those techniques work.     Furthermore, the book practices what it preaches.  Whenever the book describes a technique to make an idea sticky, the actual description of that technique is a case in point that illustrates that technique.  For example, at one point the book claims that unexpected ideas are sticky because they \\"tease and flirt\\" by \\"putting a big red X on something that needs to be discovered but don't necessarily tell you how to get there\\".  Then, the book concludes the section with the teaser: \\"And, as we'll see, a red X of spectacular size can end up driving the actions of thousands of people for many years\\".  Doesn't that unexpected teaser already make you want to find out what the big red X is?  Brilliant.
B0012QE4QC|2.0|I will tell you annie boleyn gets killed and so does her brother george mary boleyn tries to stop the king from ordering the killing of her sister annie but they go through with it anyway all because king henry wanted a boy and annie had a girl named elizabeth while mary had a boy annie the good sister and mary the evil sister the court found annie guilty of incest with her brother george because mary said that annie fooled around with george while being with king henry as the queen of england so it looked bad for the kingdom thus being treason annie denied that it happened with her brother george but I guess that's how the story goes the evil sister wins over the good sister and that's why I diden't like this movie
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I have a friend who watched this DVD recently one night . He suffers a bit from sleep-disorder. He says he had absolutely NO chance of sleeping after the undiluted deluge of adrenaline which is the Who on this album.

B0012K1ILW|5.0|WOW!! This album has had so many mixed reviews, from what i've seen online. If people understand Erykah, they will know that she is NOT your everyday kinda woman! She is a deep,sacred,virtuous, unique black woman on a WHOOOOOLE other level, and she is on her journey to even higher, spiritual, creative heights, both personally and musically, and boy am i travelling with her!! lol...   I'm loving this album!! i guess being an old soul helps (i'm 25 and LOVE 70s funk, from vicki anderson to james brown, and classic soul) and i also love Madlib's beats from the albums he has out at the moment, and the work he did with Madvillan. The man's a genius! And of course i'm a huge neo-soul fan :).. I just can't wait to listen to it some more, so i can delve into the lyrics and even more of the production! I'm loving the whole album, but especially 'me', 'soldier', 'the cell' (man what a beat!), master teacher, honey and telephone..    This is MOST DEFINITELY different from her previous albums, so i wouldn't advise anyone who hasn't listened to it yet, to listen to it with her previous work in mind! If you're a commercial head, u won't like this album or 'get' it, SIMPLE lol.. You'll only like 'honey' lol, but if you're a deep neo soul/alternative/funk lover, u will luv it!.. If you're an Erykah fan and disappointed with this album, after a few more listens i think u will begin to feel it, especially if u embrace her individuality! :)..     At the end of the day, it all depends on your personal musical tastes and also by viewing Erykah for MORE than just the music, and not to 'pigeon-hole' her music, and by capturing her essence as a person and the essence of her music, and understanding and appreciating that people grow and change...
0425210480|3.0|Polar Shift was the first Clive Cussler book I ever read and it far exceeded my expectations.  As a frequent traveler and consumer of paperbacks, I have read my share of stinkers.  Here, instead, was an author writing action, intrigue, and suspense without cursing like a sailor (though most of his heroes are just that) and without a triple X rating.    Since then, I've read 8 of his novels and have another 4 on the shelf waiting to be taken on a future road-trip.    Polar Shift is part of Cussler's series featuring Kurt Austin and easily has one of the best prologues of any Cussler book I've read to date.  You're immediately hooked and Cussler keeps up the suspense for the duration.      The middle and end are not as strong.  Like most of his novels, there are long survival-against-the elements sections and some truly incredible (read far-fetched) episodes along the way.  The ending was also slightly forgettable.    That said, you could do a lot worse and if you're looking for an easy read to eat up the miles on your next trip, grab Polar Shift.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|My Commentary here is about like the one I wrote for Season 1...BOTH SEASONS ARE UNBEATABLE!!  Though I've purchased a number of popular Series...EVERY chance I can find I watch an Episode from where I am now...halfway through Season 2.  I'm about addicted to this Series (1&2).      You guys (and gals) purchase this Series so Seasons 3 & 4 will be produced.  I can't imagine your being disappointed.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|As a teenager growing up in the sixties and with the music of The Beatles, this movie magically transported me back to that turbulent yet revolutionary decade.The story creatively weaves the lyrics of the \\"classic\\" Beatles songs with the fictional story, as if it had always been meant to be!. This touching motion picture is best enjoyed if you like movie musicals and even better, if you like the music of The Beatles. The colorful sets and cinematography are complemented by the powerful music performed beautifully by the young cast which turned out very believable performances.This is a film to be watched over again like listening to your favorite music album or music video. Whether you are 16 or 60, this music and story transcends all decades. If you can, watch in on a BIG screen and in HIGH definition and 6 channel sound for a sublime experience.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|The more I watch this Series, the more I'm addicted to it.  You've already read commentaries...hopefully you'll all purchase Seasons 1 & 2 of this Series so Season 3 (& Season 4) will be Released soon.  I've almost finished Season 2 and I'm anxious to see MORE of this GREAT Series.    Though I have purchased a number of Series, I always seem to watch these (Supernatural) nightly.
B0012QE4OO|1.0|Starring Hayden Christiansen as teleporter David Rice and Samuel L. Jackson as the NSA Specialist charged with finding and stopping all of David's breed, \\"Jumper\\" makes so many Bad Movie mistakes that it's impossible to know where to begin describing it - or to recommend it.    Across the board, it's definitely one of the most underdeveloped films I've ever sat through: clearly, the cast isn't going to be putting on Shakespeare anytime soon (Christiansen, Jamie Bell and the horrific Avril Lavigne clone that plays the whiney, ungrateful \\"love\\" interest Millie all give dreadfully hammy, two-dimensional performances, and Samuel L Jackson overacts like Faye Dunaway with a wire hanger), and the basic plot is just that: very, very basic (good guy triumphs over school bullies and dissatisfactory home life, goes on to triumph over evil governmental agency, leaves end WIIIIDE OPEN for many sequels). The script could have been written in crayons by a three-year-old (and not a bright three-year old, at that), and it's full of boring dialogue and uninteresting cliché. And the direction, for the most part, reflects the cast and the script: it's not memorable, and it's not entertaining.    So why, when 90% of the movie's elements are either badly put-together (the introduction of the adult Millie is just one scene where this movie looks and feels like a malformed cross between \\"The O.C.\\" and \\"Charmed\\"), did the director not keep the audience focused on the one area where this movie excels: action? The special effect sequences, at least on the big screen, are interesting, and some of the action scenes are very exciting.    But before you know it, those good parts are over - and for a movie whose plot centres on action, there's not very many of them to begin with - and we're once more thrust back into the mess of bad acting, bad scripting and boring story that make up the majority of \\"Jumper\\".    Personally, this would have worked better as a film about knitwear.... ...but whatever. If you have to see this one, see it in theatres: it needs a big screen to be impressive. Do not waste your money on the DVD: \\"Jumper\\" does action well, but since the majority of the movie contains no action, you'll only be wasting the better part of $20 for a futile exercise in uninteresting human interest and some pancake-flat dialogue.    Not recommended.

0452277752|4.0|If anyone but the author had decided to take Rage out of print, I would be pretty disgusted. However, I can see why he would. A lot of books and movies get blamed unjustly for glamourizing violence. This book actually does so.<br /><br />When Charlie murders two people in front of his classmates, they find themselves stunned into a bizarre, group self-exploration session. The extremity of Charlie's behavior gives them license to finally be themselves. Many of the hostages end up viewing Charlie as a dark hero: \\"Go Charlie! F--- 'em all!\\"<br /><br />So, I can understand the desire to distance oneself from this juvenile fantasy of What Would Happen if They Finally Drove Me Over the Edge, especially in a culture where students really do go into school, guns drawn, thinking of teaching the world a lesson.<br /><br />Still, it's a really good story. Charlie is a likeable character until he developes a major personality disorder. The stories about his past are all excellent. All the characters are interesting -- the other students, Charlie's parents, the girl Charlie threw up on at the beach... Some things happen that are not that plausible, but overall, it's a great story.<br /><br />It's worth buying the book just for this story, but The Long Walk is even better (one of my favorite stories), and so is The Running Man. I didn't finish reading Roadwork.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|In a godforsaken small town in Idaho, Napoleon Dynamite, the nerd to end all nerds, tries to survive high school. Harassed by the school bullies, ignored by the girls, living in a dysfunctional family consisting of his thirty years old brother, his hospitalized grandmother and the con man of his uncle, he clings to his only friend in school, the Mexican immigrant Pedro, and Debbie (Tina Majorino, who made some hit films as a child actress during the 1990s and returns to a major film after a decade), who for some mysterious reason might be attracted to him. When Pedro decides to run for school president, Napoleon Dynamite sees this as an opportunity for revenge from the rest of his class. Napoleon Dynamite seems the impossible: an outrageously funny teen comedy with zero references to sexual humor or bodily functions (maybe this has to do with the writer director being a Mormon). At first, I didn't like the movie much, as most of the jokes were at Napoleon's expense, looking as if the director was joining the bullies. But it very soon warms up to his character. It does have a resemblance to some of the movies of Todd Solondz, but without the self-hate and with a much saner sense of humor.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Excellent film!  I was worried when I heard the concept, but my worries were quited almost immediately by the film quality.  Everything was right on target; from the style of dress to interactions.  I loved it!

0810994739|5.0|After reading this site's reviews, I ordered both of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books. I have two boys, ages 11 and 9, who love to read but still are very picky about what they read. It's hit or miss with them sometimes.     Well, I had to basically force them both to BEGIN reading the books. I gave one to each of them on the same day for them to start. They complained a bit, because they didn't know much about them. A few pages in and there were no more complaints! They couldn't put them down! They even took them in the car and I would hear bursts of laughter...quite nice rather than pestering each other.     They both finished their books about the same time and quickly traded to read the next. My boys loved these books! Unfortunately there are only the two at this point because my guys are eager to read any future ones. If you are buying for an elementary age boy <maybe even a bit older>, this book is a sure winner.

B000WTNCQS|5.0|As with just about every special edition from U2, the quality starts with the packaging. Quality materials, tastefully presented, with real feeling of durability and craftsmanship.   The contents were everything I expected them to be. To be honest, the actual Joshua Tree CD didn't sound especially different, but there are some nice changes that fans will appreciate. The bonus \\"Live From Paris\\" DVD is outstanding! Amazing picture quality, and some of their great old tunes in an excellent live performance. There is also the info book, again, solidly bound, good pictures, and plenty of insight for fans. The bonus audio CD is a really good collection of some of their harder to find tracks and some odd stuff. Not much of their mainstream sound, but For me it was good to have some of it in my collection at last.  Finally, there are the amazing prints from the photography for the album it looks like. They come in their own really nice embossed envelope, printed on nice thick card. Great images, and definitely worth having framed and displayed somewhere prominent.  All in all, 100% satisfied. U2 always make sure their merchandise is good quality, and worth the money, and this certainly doesn't disappoint.  Definitely recommended.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|We saw this movie a couple of times in the movies.  My 17 year old daughter fell in love with it.  Lots of new talent & a pleasure to listen to.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|I liked this movie because I am a beatles fan.  It is almost like a musical, because the characters break out in song (beatle's songs of course!)  Really cute.  I don't know if I would let my 13 year old watch it, simply because of the drama, nipple shot, and drug use.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Ask yourself, 'is it possible for Erykah Badu to make a bad cd?'  The answer is no and I can't understand why people wouldn't like this cd.  I have all of her albums's and this could possibly be my favorite.  The beats are nice (you can't really go wrong with 9th Wonder and Madlib) and her vocals are typical erykah badu - amazing.  Soldier, the healer and honey are definitely the best tracks at first listen but after a few listens, I'm sure I'll like them all.  New Amerykah is definitely a must have for people that know what good music really is.  I would also recommend that you pick up that new Little Brother cd - its hot.
B00104QSOM|4.0|Is Daniel Day-Lewis the best actor in the world?  Given his reluctance to make many films this is a difficult question to answer.  Certainly there is no actor today of whom we expect truly extraordinary things on the rare occasions he does make a major movie.  Despite having turned in several unforgettable performances over the years of almost inconceivable range -- just contrast his effeminate fop in ROOM WITH A VIEW with his sexy Tomas in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING with his Hawkeye as ultimate action hero in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS with his wheelchair bound Christy Brown in MY LEFT FOOT (for which he justifiably won his first Oscar) with his unfairly accused political prisoner in IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER (second Oscar nomination) with the brutal Bill the Butcher in THE GANGS OF NEW YORK (third Oscar nomination).  Which is the real Daniel Day-Lewis?  None of them?  All of them?  What is so intensely exciting about Day-Lewis as an actor is how completely he becomes who he is playing.  It is hard to imagine him being different than he is in the film.  He is famous for the degree to which he stays \\"in character\\" during the filming of a movie.  I can only imagine that it takes him several days if not weeks to come down from wherever he has to exist while performing a role.<br /><br />I saw THERE WILL BE BLOOD the night before the Oscars.  The Academy Awards frequently not only get things wrong, but also do so in quite stupid ways.  They have a long history of this.  Remember, neither Alfred Hitchcock nor Barbara Stanwyck ever won Oscars, nor did Ernst Lubitsch nor Cary Grant, not did . . . and the list could go on forever.  But I left the theater completely convinced that for once a performance was so astonishing that not even the often absurd Oscars could get this one wrong.  Nor did they.  In fact, if you could do a winners competition among the Oscar winners, Day-Lewis might beat out all the other winners this decade for a sort of Super Oscar.  I don't remember the last time I saw a performance this amazing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'm not convinced the rest of the movie is as good as Day-Lewis.  I give it five stars, but I wonder if it is the masterpiece many are proclaiming it.  I'll share my doubts later in the review.  There were many things I loved in the film.  I don't remember the last time I loved an incidental sound track like I did this one (though of course, a film like ONCE, where the music was central to the whole film, is a completely different matter -- one of the other things I loved at this year's Oscars was Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova winning an Oscar of their own).  The music was sometimes lyrical, but more often it was atmospheric, generating an almost visceral reaction.  ONCE aside, this may have been the movie from 2007 whose music I most enjoyed.<br /><br />And visually this was a delight.  Shot after shot was a complete delight.  Even today, several days after having seen the movie, a host of brilliant images come to mind.  The bare, sparse, almost ascetic sets were haunting.  I especially love the beginning of the film.  It must have been at least 15 to 20 minutes into the film before the first word was spoken.  Yet during that time we learn so much about Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) and the world he inhabits.  It is brutal, demanding, and dangerous work.<br /><br />Obviously Paul Thomas Anderson means the film in a topical way.  I actually read many, many years ago Upton Sinclair's OIL, the book upon which this film was loosely based.  Sinclair was, of course, an ardent socialist, a position I'm not at all out of sympathy with.  Like Sinclair and, apparently, Anderson, I agree that capitalism is a very dangerous, extraordinarily unproductive economic system.  Well, it is productive for those at the top, but not for most of the people within that economy.  But my complaints are far more specific, with the delusions of the free marketers (if the free marketers ever bothered to actually read Adam Smith they would discover that he is not a free marketer, since he believed that there should be many moral limits placed on economic enterprise -- in other words, Smith felt that government might need to intervene in an economy, something the most ardent free marketers would deny).  Now I go into this in a tiny bit of detail to contrast it with what THERE WILL BE BLOOD says about capitalism, which is:  capitalism is bad.  There is no subtlety in the depiction of Plainview as a capitalist.  We see that in the end it leaves neither the exploiter nor the exploited happy, but is that because there is something messed up on the system?  Or is it simply because Plainview is a sociopath?<br /><br />Anderson strikes out against the second great blight on American life today.  If free market utopians have destroyed the economic well being of most Americans by their promises that if we just stick with the market, all will benefit (embodied in various trickle down theories -- but as one of Plainview's contemporaries, Will Rogers, liked to explain, gold isn't, like many assume, like water.  If you put it at the top of a pile, it doesn't trickle down to everything below.  Nope, Gold is like Gold.  Put it at the top and it just stays there).  But the second blight on American life is clearly a politicized fundamentalist Christianity.  If Anderson aims one barrel of his shotgun at capitalist exploiters, the other is at false religious leaders.  The two forces clash for the length of the film, until literally coming to blows at the end.  But again, apart from just throwing Eli's hypocritical preacher out there as a symbol of the emptiness of religion gone bad, nothing is either said or even hinted at on a deeper level.  We all know that there are charlatan preachers.  We know there are religious demagogues like James Dobson and Pat Robertson.  Just as Plainview says nothing about capitalism in general, so Eli says nothing about religion in general.  They are paraded out as symbols, but their symbolism is never truly investigated.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if this is not a deep film, it is on the surface of things a brilliant one.  There are so many great moments.  The scene in which Plainview converts to Christianity in order to get the rights to take his pipeline across the property of one old crank is as unforgettable as any scene you'll ever encounter.<br /><br />By the way, the line from the film that is quickly becoming one of the most famous from any recent film - \\"I drink your milkshake\\" - comes, according to an interview I heard with Paul Thomas Anderson, from testimony that Senator Albert Fall gave during the Teapot Dome Scandal.  Fall was explaining about \\"drainage,\\" drilling at an angle to take oil that is below the surface of someone else's land.  (Not that I'm trying to justify Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but what precipitated that invasion was precisely Kuwait's stealing Iraq's oil by drilling at a sharp angle at their border into Iraqi oil reserves.  Iraq actually had a legitimate complaint against Kuwait, though I'm sure no one believes that this justified their invading the smaller country.)  Anderson claimed - I have not independently verified this - that Fall used the same image as that in the film.  Namely, \\"If you have a milkshake and I have a milkshake, and my straw reaches all across the room, then I drink your milkshake.\\"  Though Anderson also admits he embellished the line a bit.  No question that Daniel Day-Lewis sold the line.<br /><br />But in the end, there is one main reason for seeing this film:  Daniel Day-Lewis.  Before I saw this I would have put him on the shortest of short lists of the great actors of his age.  Now I truly think he stands alone.scover that he is not a free marketer, since he believed that there should be many moral limits placed on economic enterprise -- in other words, Smith felt that government might need to intervene in an economy, something the most ardent free marketers would deny).

0060555661|5.0|Benjamin is a great philosopher of stock market rather than a normal technician. After so many years passed, you just how his ideas are proving to be accurate, yet.   The only thing that he was wrong about, was commodities. He didn't believe it but time has proved that it's a safe haven for cash through many years.  The commentary given after each chapter is also helpful as sometimes it's a little hard to understand Benjamin's literature.
B000066NW0|5.0|The novelty has worn off since it's been over 5 years since it was unleashed upon the world.  Really, this is one of the best albums I've ever heard. People who will mock me for saying this are silly little people who love to condescend others, and that's okay. Deal with people the way they deal with you, is my take on it.  Avril is very lucky that she had the kind of writers she did at the time, who read her personality and who she was and turned it into 13 INCREDIBLE tracks that brought teens and adults alike together.    What can I say? The tunes AND the lyrics are absolutely incredible. Ever since this damn album I have been dying for others to make something even close to this. I was heavily obsessed, as a 17 year old at the time. I think that if it was released today, I would still be obsessed. Forget about the Avril image in the media today, or any negativity you may have against her. The tracks are fresh, even for today, original and just plain addictive.    'Anything but Ordinary' and 'Complicated' are on my list of top 10 favourite songs ever, 'Dreams to Dream' being my first... And they are just absolutely brilliant songs. I do love it when songs reach for high notes and aren't afraid to expand through the regions of melodies. More often these days it's like people are afraid to move for than two notes up or down from whichever note they started. It's just such a shame.  An example of the broad range of notes hit in this film, let's look at Anything but Ordinary for a moment. The 'nough' in 'Is it e-nough' is almost an entire octave higher than where the 'is it e' part starts off on. It's terrific!  And I love in 'Complicated' the first thing you hear is 'Chill out, what you yellin' for, lay back, it's all been done before. And if you could only let it be, you would see...' Well there's an brilliant and original tune right there. By that time I'm thinking \\"God, who needs the chorus? This is addictive enough\\". And the thing that makes it is the varying notes strung together in such a short space.    And lyrics-wise, I also believe that one of the big attractions to this album in regards to the teenage spectrum would have to be how easy it was for them to relate to what was being sung. In the song 'Things I'll Never Say', for instance, there's the line \\"I'm tugging at me hair, I'm pulling in my clothes, I'm trying to keep my cool, I know it shows. I'm staring at my feet, my cheeks are turning red, I'm searching for the words inside my head. I'm feeling nervous, trying to be so perfect, cause I know you're worth it.\\" Aside from the gorgeous tune accompanying it, how beautiful honest are these lyrics? I know that at the time when I was 17, I lapped this particular song up because I related soooo much. And I know that most other teens did. This was back before the whole \\"Alternative/Emo Superbeings Are Our Superior\\" regiment took over the souls of every teen in creation.    Anyway, like I said, and even my friend, there is not one single track on this album that is not good.    My favourites in order:    1. Anything but Ordinary: 5/5  (All about the rushes in life, I guess. And of course the fear of being ordinary.)    2. Complicated: 5/5 (About a relationship that gets complicated on one side only.)    3. Naked: 5/5  (About letting somebody in to see the real you.)    4. Things I'll Never Say: 5/5  (About wishing you could say things, but they either come out wrong or you're too afraid to say them in the first place.)    5. I'm With You: 4/5  (Wanting to find somebody to love, but not sure where to start.)    6. S8er Boi: 4/5  (About a skater boy who becomes famous and ditches the snobby girl who secretly liked him!! Top fun this.)    7. Tomorrow: 4/5  (About not believing somebody when they say they love you.)    8. My World: 4/5  (This is all about Avril's life)    9. Too Much: 4/5  (Wondering if somebody could just BE there for you; is it really too much to be asking for?)    10. Nobody's Fool: 4/5 (An interesting track, all about not turning into somebody else to suit another)    11. Mobile: 4/5  (About things changing too much)    12. Unwanted: 4/5 (About being shut out of someone's life when around other people)    13. Losing Grip: 4/5 (Deciding to end a relationship after the significant other causes you to snap with frustration)      I hope this helps.
0143113100|5.0|I bought this book out of pure curiosity not as any kind of inspirational self-help type tool. It's quite fascinating and very easy for a non-scientist (I'm an artist) to read. I've almost finished it now and find myself looking forward to reading it whenever I can just like I would a good novel-that alone is somewhat inspiring if you ask me. I highly recommend it and I've learned a lot about how the brain functions and have enjoyed reading it immensely. The side-effect to reading this book is a nagging desire to improve my own brain... maybe it's turned into self-help after all.
B00004VVNB|3.0|I saw Logan's Run in 1976 and about the best I can say about it is that it was \\"so-so\\" even for the science fiction films of that year. As one writer has stated, the same can be said about the DVD transfer. I must reluctantly give this film three stars and think I am being generous.<br /><br />The best feature of this film was beautiful Jenny Agutter who played lovely Jessica while Michael York played Logan by the numbers.  Peter Ustinov was as good as could be expected playing an \\"old man\\".  I don't see how he let them talk him into making this movie.<br /><br />I also think the film may deserve an \\"A\\" for effort for the model work done to produce the many exterior views of Logan's City.  However, in execution it only came off like a very well done train layout of the 50's. It just wasn't something that professional special effects people or cinematographers could be proud of.<br /><br />After seeing the groundbreaking work of Kubrick's 2001, this film just couldn't be considered good sci-fi.  It really was a major disappointment and I was embarrassed to have suggested seeing it.  I purchased the DVD just to remind myself to try to make better film suggestions.<br /><br />This happened after promising my new bride of a couple of month's marriage that our visit to the theater wouldn't be a complete waste of her time.  How could I know it would be this poor? I read about how grand it was in the newspaper.  She looked at me when we left the theater and I didn't say a word.  Needless to say I was in for a couple of \\"slice-of-life\\" movies after this turkey.<br /><br />Students of architecture will appreciate that the great city of Logan's Run was prophetic of the construction materials and style of many of the modern malls popping up across the country.  Perhaps this has more to do with the price of contemporary construction materials of that time than in any visionary thinking on the part of the set designers.<br /><br />In my defense, the newspapers wrote promising hype about upcoming grand science fiction films to be released starting in 1976 and mentioned Logan's Run as one outstanding example. As you would imagine when I went to see the film in an excellent theater with good sound and a large screen I was beyond disappointment.  It was only when we went to see STAR WARS that I was partially redeemed and my wife would again allow me to suggest a movie without too much discussion.ms to be released starting in 1976 and mentioned Logan's Run as one outstanding example.

0141007885|5.0|I could not believe what I was reading, a horrific story of just how bad the human race can be.  I honestly had never heard of Nanking and I've read several books on WWII.  This book is graphic in its detail of just how badly the Chinese people, women in particular, we treated.  I found it difficult to put the book down and would certainly recommend it.
B0012K1ILW|1.0|As someone previously stated, this CD sounds like it came from Mars.  How a talented lady can output such a horrific mess is beyond me.  Her first CD was a masterpiece. This, however,is very scattered, frantic and highly unlistenable.  Erykah, what were you thinking?
B0000AUHOH|4.0|this movie has its charms, especially (and obviously) for fans of the original series like myself. but it really is a pretty crappy movie overall. the perofrmances seem to almost border self parody, especially with scotty. the crew has a sort of 3 stooges routine going on, acting like bumbling fools. there's even two scenes featuring kirk, bones and spock camping in what are suppose to be 'futuristic sleeping bags'. in actuallity the aging sci-fi icons look like potatoes wrapped in foil. while acting like average joes in the woods dressed with flanels tucked into tight wrangler jeans, spock treats himself to a \\"marsh-mellon\\" and they make sad attempts to sing one of the easiest and also dumbest sing alongs ever.......row row your boat. ya no joke.  other highlights, or lowlights, depending on where you stand with sort of thing, include what is supposed to pass as a sexy kinked up dance by uhura wearing some kind of feathered wings. close ups of \\"her legs\\" just seem to wriggle and dig her feet into the sand. back in the day of the original series this would have been pretty sweet but now this kind of exploitation is just awkward and straight up bizarre. as are the sexual overtones between her and scotty. with soft caresses n all that seem to come out of know where. this could really go on and on but rather than spoil all the surprises i simply suggest downloading the mike nelson and kevin murphy (mst3k) from rifftrax.com to properly view this surreal trek.  4 stars with the commentary!
0525948023|5.0|I was having a panic attack one day. I read the 1st chapter of this book and then it went away. As a person who has been looking for all kinds of answers this book answered a lot of my questions.    I'm not so tense about the things I normally would freak out about. I feel like I would be crazier today or insane without opening this book. I recommend this book to every human being on the planet.    Try it. Work with it. The further you read into the book, the better you get and dropping a whole lot of baggage.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|terrifying slasher film. the scariest and most intelligent of the genre. the voice of that maniac over the phone crawls under your skin. careful about reading too much info from reviews and other sources about this movie. the plot can easily be ruined. now available in a new special edition release! time to upgrade.
0374530718|5.0|I forget where I found this book - not, I think, on Amazon.  I took it on vacation, thinking a novel about philosophy should at least help me sleep at night.  Not only did I race through it eagerly, but my better half, who has not been seen reading a book for pleasure in the 8 years we've been together, also picked it up and couldn't put it down.  We've just ordered six more copies to give to friends.  This time from Amazon - a much better deal.
B0002PUHF6|5.0|i didnt know what to expect when i first saw this. i hadnt seen many horror comedys so i kept expecting it to streighten itself out and get freaky. as soon as i heard the openning theme which was a play off of the psycho theme i shold have known better.   re-animator is just nasty fun and highly re-watchable. i can easily see how it may have a following. the millenium edition is loaded! it looks and sounds perfect. easily the best release from elite entertainment with i spit on your grave coming second.   a very fun horror flick with equally great release. thank beezlebub for this format!!    on a side note, what is up with the re-release?? i really hope re-animator doesn't develope the greedy Evil Dead cash-in syndrome. as if a new commentary or interview is supposed to warrant re-purchase. on the other hand, if that commentary featured joe bob briggs or mike nelson, than you can count me in, but that's a long shot. and i do like how the dvd format is turning into happy meals, as i have to admit i almost bought the new release just for the toy. GEEK....
B0012K1ILW|1.0|I was expecting a little more from Ms. Badu on this album- I was so excited that I pre-ordered it.  I can appreciate the actual music, but I was looking for a little more from the lyrical side from her (well, she does actually speak, but barely sings).  The whole album sounds like splices of interludes streamed together. I am going to have to screen her next album before I purchase it, to make sure there is something there worth buying.
B000UJ48V8|5.0|that's right full metal is about the war within. most people think kubrick did not focus on the human condition. are you kidding? we have two prime examples right here, the first being focused on gomer pile, the second half on joker. two very different struggles and all bein from within. this psychological struggle is in the shining, clockwork, 2001 and so on....  anyway, this film is classic and for good reason. it's awsome. there's a million quatable lines which tends to suggest that the script has something going for it. lee ermy shines like a diamond here. we witness moody scenes that often burrow into our psyche. pile's suicide typically burns it's way into there. the scene compsotion (thanks to kubricks still photography roots) is beautiful and often surreal, not too far from the shining.   everyone tends to favor the first half. being that full metal jacket almost feels like 2 seperate films, it's almost impossible to measure up to, or exceed the greatness of the first. what i realised is that you should not try to relate the two parts as they really are totally different. the films pace slows down with the second half as well. the actual battle scenes are far and few between, further alienating full metal jacket from being a typical war movie. it almost seems that the war is actually over. i always felt like the soldiers were just meandering around ruins to make sure no survivors remained. just a grim feeling runs through you during these episodes.  the music shouldnt be overlooked in any of kubricks work. we have a mix of popluar songs with atmospheric pieces filled with jarring ambiant tones, void of melody. highly effective sound track in its manic structure.  this dvd seems to have the fewest extras of all the sets releases, however we are treated to commentary by several of the films participants. if only ermy made more of an appearance on the track.   too many people piss n moan over screening ratios and nit pick every little detail. after seeing thismovie so many times on a vhs tape i am elated i have it here in this presentation as was intended by the man himself who made it for us. and actually, we have even more than he intended in this case. no complaints form me. 5+ stars!     m-i-c--k-e-y. m-o-u-s-e.......
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Words cannot describe these videos, I saw the series on TV and was in awe and many times teary eyed by the wonders of our world.  Everyone should own this set.  I've watched it twice already.  Bravos to all connected in the making of it.  Five stars is not enough, this one deserves 10 stars!
B0013FXWU6|2.0|Being a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson, my expectations were high for this flick, but alas, it did not deliver. Brilliantly directed by Anderson, with a phenomenal central performance by Daniel Day Lewis, I think the problem with the film is at a fundamental and conceptual level. The work is ambitiously themed, but Anderson hasn't taken the time--or perhaps didn't have the desire--to draw us into the story or the characters. Magnolia was an epic, ambitious work also, but it was on a human scale, and Anderson never seemed to be reaching for his effects. There Will Be Blood is another matter: it's all reaching, but it comes back empty-handed. Based on Upton Sinclair's novel, the film tells the tale of oil man Daniel Plainview, a man without substance, and apparently without heart or soul, driven by mysterious forces (forces that are never revealed), whose only passion is for oil. Plainview doesn't appear to be all that interested in profit, even, and although he is a ruthless businessman, the impression the film gives is that this is more a point of principle than actual greed. We are never given a clue as to what might be behind such a principle, however, or behind the character's stubborn, almost inhuman drive.<br /><br />The trouble with There Will Be Blood is that, if you place a hollow man at the center of your movie, you are likely to wind up with a hollow movie. Daniel Day Lewis carries the film on his sinewy shoulders, and he keeps us gripped by the sheer magnetism of his presence; but the script doesn't provide much context for his performance, and the character seems to be almost entirely the actor's creation. Long as the film is (158 minutes), Anderson doesn't use the time to establish his characters, or appear to care about building suspense. He seems to consider such conventions beneath him, and the result is fuzzy, muted, shapeless and meandering. Individual scenes are often strong--the film is gorgeously photographed--and there's certainly a dark poetry and lyricism to the film; but because there's no central thread to tie the scenes together, and without much narrative or character drive, the various episodes just hang in a void. Since we have no clue as to what drives the central character, there is nothing to drive the scenes forward either. Violent confrontations--between Plainview and the preacher, Ely, between Ely and his father, and the final murder--should be intensely disturbing but somehow fail to move us. Anderson doesn't make us feel the tensions that lead up to these scenes, so they appear to come out of nowhere; they seem overwrought, faintly ludicrous. Inside such a dramatic vacuum, Lewis' performance--intense as it is--becomes often blackly amusing: Plainview seems not only psychotic but absurd. Yet we can't tell if he's meant to seem that way or not.<br />For such a bleak and violent work, Blood is almost devoid of tension. And for all the care that has gone into the film's look, and despite the central performance, it's rather slack, even tedious. It's clear Anderson is aiming for something big, but I think the ambitiousness of his concepts has undone him (though this is presumably why the film is being praised so extravagantly). He's trying to paint the portrait of a soulless man, driven by greed or unfathomable obsession, whose complete lack of feeling for anyone or anything besides oil turns him, by steady degrees, into a psychopath. And he's probably aiming at a parable for our times, in which insane corporate greed strips the Earth of its blood and man of his soul. But the film may be too finely conceived: Anderson has forgotten to take the trouble to draw us into the story and make it dramatic, meaningful, and what's on the screen are his lofty intentions, but not much of a movie.<br />There Will Be Blood left me entirely cold. I felt nothing for the characters, and besides Plainview there are no characters, really. There is the preacher Ely, who is faintly despicable but otherwise less than substantial, and Plainview's son, who barely says a dozen words throughout the film. The rest are shadows, and Anderson seems to have intended it this way (he has cast the film almost entirely with unknowns). And although Daniel Day Lewis is mesmerizing throughout, there is only one scene which gives us a glimpse of what is going on inside Plainview and allows us to see him as a human being (the scene when he admits to hating people). Mostly, he seems like some relentless force of nature, a golem, driven by sheer hatred. But there's nothing to account for this hatred: like everything else in the film, it seems to exist in a void.<br />There Will Be Blood is a tale told by a genius, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Critics may beg to differ, but if so, I suspect they are responding to the film's intentions more than what it actually achieves. Since Anderson's film appears to be about something, even though it never connects with us emotionally, it's being treated with awe and reverence (with repeat comparisons to Citizen Kane). But I think this is Anderson's weakest film, and except for one or two scenes (such as when Plainview's son is deafened in a rigging accident), it's almost entirely lacking in the compassion, the humanity, which made his previous films so remarkable. There Will Be Blood appears to be a case of a filmmaker getting carried away by the grandiosity of his vision, being too busy mapping the forest to remember to plant the trees. It's the sound of one hand clapping., and Plainview's son, who barely says a dozen words throughout the film.

039472903X|5.0|You gotta love Mr. Ogilvy's books. I totally recommend this book and his previous \\"confessions of an advertising man\\". Except for being a great tool for fast pace learning, and being written in a blunt spirit, it is great to give a larger perspective on advertising as it is. Great for graphic designers, who want to see the larger picture.
B00008WT5C|5.0|I just picked up all the old AC/DC albums and was really impressed.  The sound quality on the re-mastered CDs is so much better than my older versions.  After hearing one, I immediately replaced all the old CDs.  Its a breath of fresh air for this music, it feels live, raw, and right in your room.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie and the game too. This is for anybody that likes a good old fasioned fist to fist street brawl along with weapons of course.
B00005JNX0|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. Our almost three-year-old daughter loves it. She is a big fan of Alex and Marty. And we adults are totally impressed too. There are so many funny details, so many funny minor characters like the trash-scavenging, newspaper-reading, British accented chimpanzees, the penguins, very funny Sascha Baron Cohen lending the voice for the king of lemurs. The music is great. Our daughter watches it at least twice everyday (other parents wrote about its appeal to kids, and I totally understand that) and is still not tired of it.

B000002JOH|5.0|Vulgar Display of Power followed the album Cowboys From Hell.  Cowboys is a great album.  It's kind of an intro to what Pantera is all about which has to be respected.  But to me, when Vulgar came out I was entering me Senior year of high school so I was 16/17 at the time and I remember buying this on cassette tape when it came out.  It was a warm day and I rolled down my windows and popped in VDOP.    The first song with the double bass drums of Mouth for War pushed my rear speakers to the limit.  I actually had to re-wind the beginning because I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  No other metal tape pushed the limits of my speakers like that before.  I wasn't even past the first sone and had to listen to it again.    I was so impressed by the album being a heavy Metallica/Megadeth/Danzing guy at the time, I had to drop this nuclear bomb on my friends.  Well, it spread like a cancer and all my friends who heard it ran out and bought it as well.    The grunge scene cripped the metal scene greatly which sucks, so for me Vulgar Display of Power is the apex, yes the apex, of when HEAVY METAL reached it's greatest point.  Other albums such as Metallica's Black Album (1 year earlier), Megadeth's Symphony of Destruction, and Danzing III:  How the Gods Kills all came out around the time of Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power.    Black Sabbath, Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, Slayer, Danzig, Suicidal Tendencies were all metal greats.  Pantera helped carry metal to the top of the mountain with this album (VDOP).  To me things haven't been the same since.  Yea, we have bands like Korn, Slipknot, Mudvayne, Disturbed, System of a Down, Soulfly, etc...but it will be a long time before we see metal greats again.  I heard talks were just starting over e-mail with Phil and Dimebag about patching things up and maybe playing again as Pantera after their bitter break-up.  It's unfortunate some douche bag with a gun had to murder Dimebag.  The guy obviously had issues and blamed dimebagfor Panter'a break-up.  If the guy had a clue they were in the starts of trying to work things out for a possible re-union.  Now that will never happen.  Seems every nut has a gun these days.  Music like Pantera is about getting together at shows with people going through the same B.S. of life.  We all have stress, issues, anger, etc. and music is suppose to be the release for that.  Your not suppose to act it out in the form of violence.      Anyway, great album.  I would rank Black Sabbath, Black Sabbath best metal album of the 70's, Metallica's Master of Puppets best metal album of the 80's, and Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power as the best metal album of the 90's.  RESPECT - WALK - ARE YOU TALKING TO ME!!?
0446677450|5.0|What a book!    It will change your perpective on education and economy. You will see the world as it is, not the way people want it to be...which leads to 'poorville'.     It is recommended for high school students, as it was part of summer reading list bck when I was in h.s. If you have kids and want them to succeed in life this book is for you and them. Before giving it to your child read it. It will change you, and after that you will be able to help your child be successful instead of impeding it. I know you mean well, but in digital world analog thinking will not survive.    Read it, and make your kids read it, for it will shape your lives for success.
1594489505|2.0|I looke forward to this book after reading the Kite Runner. But honeslty I was disappointed. It is agiven the situation for the women was deplorable. But this book seemed to have been written in a rush and simple retold all the sterotypical issues many associatewith radicial muslim society. How many times do we read the same story over and over with different names for the characters. Sorry I paid full price.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I thought that this movie was a classic and perfect example of a 'popcorn' flick.  It's riveting, gets the senses going and is a true visual feast.<br /><br />When amazon sold it for about 7 bucks on sale it was a no brainer.  Great fun, and easy to watch on repeated viewings.

B0012K1ILW|5.0|I have read the reviews that stated that they hate this CD but if you have been a follower of Ms. Badu, U should have known that she is not the type of artist that will give U something that fits tightly with what is going on commercially in music.  She is an artist blazing her own trail...thank God...This CD is simply brilliant.  From the opening track \\"Amerykahn Promise\\" to the closing track \\"Honey,\\" (which is the most commercial song on the CD) this is a CD you will have to LISTEN to a few spins to digest where she is coming from these days.  Blending hip hop with funk with R&B soul with social commentary can be quite daunting to figure out for the casual listener.  But the ease that she has done it on this CD is a testament to Ms. Badu talent.  Listen to the hip-hop/soul kissed \\"Solider\\" or the three part \\"Master Teacher\\" featuring Bilal will make U say why can't we get music with this much depth on the radio.  For those individuals who didn't get it the first time out, listen to the CD again and OPEN YOUR MIND and let the groove capture your imagination.  Thank U Ms. Badu for creating the first off the hook CD for 2008.  The terms \\"classic\\" and \\"masterpiece\\" are sometimes used to loosely but I can't help but feel that 10 years from now, this CD will be praise as being classic/masterpiece...don't sleep on this experience.

0634060384|1.0|Please read.... I'm glad that Hal Leonard has seen fit to correct many keys and chord changes with this 6th edition. I'm also glad the typeset is consistent and clear. HOWEVER, the reason for such a low score is what HL professes in it's advertising. Here is the quote from Hal Leonard in regard to the consistency of the older editions verses this new \\"legal\\" one...     \\"You won't even notice the difference, other than that all of the notorious errors have been fixed: the covers and typeface look the same, the song list is nearly identical....\\"    How can the song list be \\"nearly identical\\" when in fact 121 songs from the previous edition are GONE? To further make the book confusing to consumers, and presumably in an effort to make the book \\"look\\" as full as the previous edition, 86 new, unrelated tunes have been added as padding to the table of contents list.    What makes this an issue of concern is that of the 121 tunes missing are well-known, critical tunes that WILL be called on at gigs. Apparently a few of the copyright owners didn't see fit to jump on board the HL band wagon. I would have been fine with this book if it hadn't been passed off as being the same as the previous edition, but with corrections and the old list in tact.    If you REALLY want the best of both worlds, you'll have to buy the new HL version, and then add the missing tunes from the old one to the HL one (it's plastic comb bound, so that task can easy be done at Kinko's for close to nothing). I suppose the only issue beyond this would be the conflicting of keys and song form for some tunes if others musicians at your gig still operate out of the old edition.    This has been a real mess trying to decode the Real Book bottom line. As much of a multi-million dollar corporation Hal Leonard is, they could have saved us the hassle by disclosing these VERY CRUCIAL discrepancies up front.
B000XNZ7LG|5.0|Knowing that this was based off of memoirs I expected the film to overemphasize or exaggerate the events - like most memoirs-turn-movies do.  As if memoirs don't tend to exaggerate memories enough.    During the first viewing of the movie, I thought that some of the more graphic/violent scenes were a bit gratuitous.  Though as I kept watching in my second viewing, watching the graphic scenes seemed justified, and all the while likely horrifically accurate in depicting the time and place.  In the end, I didn't feel like the story even memoirs was overexaggerated.  They went with simple, and it worked.
0385720920|5.0|Out of Palahniuk's first four novels, this one is the one that I have enjoyed the most. All of them deal with themes relevant to contemporary culture, but he chooses different aspects of that culture and provides a satirical narrative intended to shock the reader into thinking about the questions his stories raise. Fight Club dealt with consumerism, Survivor with commercialized religiosity, Invisible Monsters with vanity, and finally Choke deals with addiction and the search for happiness in our reality. Although the protagonist, Victor, is a sex addict, he is an archetypal denizen of the modern world, since most of us are addicted to one thing or another.

The first book is good, but there is tons left unfinished, which is fine because there are two more books coming. Still, I think I will wait for all three books to be completed before reading the second book. I'd like to read it all at once, but that's just a personal preference.
B0011FXLCC|5.0|I've been on board with Goldfrapp from the start, and what a weird and wonderful ride it's been... from the soundtracky surrealism of Felt Mountain, through the smutty electro of Black Cherry, to the disco/glam/Kate Bush-ism of Supernature, to... this.<br /><br />Many bands mix up their sound over time, seeming to follow trends or to embrace change for its own sake in hopes of not stagnating.  So when I tell you that Will and Alison have gone and made a quietly psychedelic, string-soaked, and--dare I say it?--almost \\"folk-y\\" album, please forgive me when I immediately follow up that statement by saying it comes off as the most natural thing in the world.<br /><br />Whereas I pointed out in my review of [[ASIN:B000EGDC14 Supernature]] that it was the best party album in years, for its fabulous production and its combination of truly danceable beats with genuine listenability and accessibility, Seventh Tree is the album to listen to the following morning over a slightly hangover-tinged breakfast. Or any other time that slow (though by no means bloodless) and pretty (and pretty doesn't even cover the half of it) is the order of the day. Where previous Goldfrapp albums simply begged to be listened to at night, and were energetic affairs, this one is the most sun-soaked, joyously soporific album since at least [[ASIN:B000QUU2YI Deluxe]] or [[ASIN:B00042YJJ2 Hosianna Mantra]], though it sounds little like either. Listening to it, one half expects to see gentle rays of hazy sunlight coming from the speakers as it plays.<br /><br />So what or who does it sound like? I'll resist the lazy comparisons to Nick Drake a lot of reviewers have been making (I guess if you're twee, English, and surrealistic you sound like Nick Drake, even when you sound not a damn thing like Nick Drake), and try to describe it in terms of things I have heard before. Picture the most ornate, prettiest sounds of late-period Beatles by way of the quieter, more joyous moments of early Kate Bush, occasionally--particularly on \\"A&E\\"--hit with a shot of Yaz. \\"Cologne Cerrone Houdini\\" will make fans of Goldfrapp's own Felt Mountain very, very happy. \\"Caravan Girl\\" is the most energetic on the album, but with a Krautrock-y, motorik sound rather than a dance beat: perfect for a nice, leisurely afternoon drive. In the end though, I must protest that it simply doesn't sound like anything else at all. Therein lies genius, my friends...<br /><br />Why buy the deluxe edition?  In addition to an interesting if not fascinating documentary about the album, there's the gorgeous video to (the gorgeous) \\"A&E,\\" packaged in a beaultiful textured box. For fans of \\"the Alison in the Goldfrapp,\\" so to speak, however, the deluxe is the only way to go, with beautifully photographed postcards and a poster of the incomparable Ms. Goldfrapp herself, lest you doubted for a second that such gorgeous music could ever come out of anything less than one of the most beautiful women anywhere (not to take anything from Will Gregory). Plus a curious little booklet with all of the lyrics in (what I take to be) AG's handwriting, decorated with silly coloured pencil drawings.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you want another Supernature, someone else will have to do that for you. Or you can just listen to it again; I've probably done so hundreds of times with no worry of diminishing returns. On the other hand, if you want a fantastic album that, like its predecessor, is gorgeously produced, accessible, listenable, and utterly unlike anything that's come before it, buy this. And if you're that nasty reviewer over at Pitchfork, all I can say is (Amazon won't actually let me say what I want to say to say, so I'll just say) ...find a new job.A&E\\"--hit with a shot of Yaz. \\"Cologne Cerrone Houdini\\" will make fans of Goldfrapp's own Felt Mountain very, very happy. \\"Caravan Girl\\" is the most energetic on the album, but with a Krautrock-y, motorik sound rather than a dance beat: perfect for a nice, leisurely afternoon drive.

B00005JKNF|5.0|Robert Altman's 2001 Academy Award-winning \\"Gosford Park\\" defies easy characterization.  Nominally a closed house English murder mystery taking place during a 1930's weekend shooting party at a country estate, it features a huge cast of developed characters, a variety of colliding subplots, and highly detailed period sets.  Shot in typical Altman style, the camera ranges upstairs among the aristocrats and downstairs among the servants.  There is so much going on that the actual murder almost gets lost in the near chaos.<br /><br />Each of the guests gathering at Sir William McCorkle's (Michael Gambon) estate for the weekend shooting party has an agenda.  Many are financially dependent to one degree or another on the coarse and selfish McCorkle. Rivalries are fought out in politely understated but often vicious conversations.  Much of the story is told through the eyes of the servants below stairs, headed by Alan Bates as the head butler and Helen Mirren in a magnificent turn as the housekeeper.  Each of the servants has his or her stoutly defended place in the hierarchy of the house, and his or her own secrets, which are suspensefully doled out over the course of the film.  Clive Owen, a valet with an attitude, will turn out to have both a leading role and surprising connections with several members of the household.  Kelly McDonald, as a young lady's maid learning her trade serving a waspish but financially needy Countess played by Maggie Smith, provides an innocent viewpoint on much of the goings-on.<br /><br />The murder itself is something of an afterthought, ineptly investigated by a pompous police inspector (in a typically humorous performance by Stephen Fry).  Its solution will play out among members of the household in unexpected ways that have little to do with law enforcement.<br /><br />This is a challenging film to watch.  Viewers will want to take advantage of the extra features on this DVD for more insight into what is going and how \\"Gosford Park\\" was put together.  It is in the end a highly entertaining movie, most apt to appeal to fans of Robert Altman's unique movie-making style and to fans of ensemble British movies.the end a highly entertaining movie, most apt to appeal to fans of Robert Altman's unique movie-making style and to fans of ensemble British movies.
B0012QE4OY|3.0|...and dance they do! And they do it very, very well.<br /><br />4.5 stars for the jaw dropping moves these kids are able to do but a mere 2 stars for everything else, so let's round that to 3 stars shall we.<br /><br />Though it's been said over and over again about other movies of this ilk, there has to be more to a movie than the dancing and as far as Step Up 2 the Streets goes, the other stuff just doesn't really cut it.<br /><br />The film chronicles - did I say chronicles? - sorry, no, this movie doesn't chronicle anything, it's about a young street dancer named Andie (Briana Evigan). She's beautiful, out of this world talented and certainly doesn't want to be shipped off to Texas which is where she's headed if she doesn't stop getting into trouble.<br /><br />Andie gets accepted into the elite Maryland School of the Arts (MSA) where she attempts to widen her dancing scope to more classical styles. Her street dancing crew the 4-1-0 - all but one of whom does not know Andie is now enrolled in the school - become sick and tired of the excuses she gives as to why she isn't able to attend practice with them and they eventually kick her out of the crew.<br /><br />This is where I find the character flaws in the movie to be really apparent...these kids are obviously in their late teens and 20s, however they spend all day dancing in the streets, Have they no jobs?? No responsibilities?? How do they pay for the cost of living? Don't they even take a break to make some deals or turn some tricks?? It's not just that they are sooo devoted to dancing and preparing for a dance battle called \\"The Streets\\", the writers make it seem like they genuinely solely exist to practice their dancing 24-7. No one has to go home because their baby-mama is always nagging, no one has goals or dreams, their only purpose in the film is to dance...and still with all that practice they still don't have what it takes.<br /><br />Fortunately, all these annoyances are seasoned with superbly choreographed and exceptionally performed dance numbers that make the knot in my forehead relax until the plot gets back underway.<br /><br />Andie decides to put together her own crew made up of static, clich&eacute; outcast kids that go to MSA. There's the Asian girl who thinks she's \\"down\\" but you can't understand a word she says, the tall-loner girl no one hangs out with, a guy who's supposed to be the nerdy guy, but this isn't really developed, a few others not worth mentioning and the other main character, Chase Collins (Robert Hoffman).<br /><br />When we first hear of Chase, we are immediately led to believe that he is MSA royalty but living in the shadow of his older, more talented MSA faculty brother and also that his dancing skills have given him a sense of entitlement making him something of a playa with the ladies. This would be all well and good, for Chase would be a well-developed character and even have opportunities for growth as he tries to redeem himself from his philandering ways and woo our heroine Andie. However, as soon as we get to know Chase, he's not like this at all, in fact none of the earlier descriptions of him are mentioned again or developed at all - he's just a regular boring guy with nothing extraordinarily good or bad about him. But, like everyone else in the film, he's great looking...and man, can he dance!<br /><br />Alright, so the \\"plot\\" eventually brings us to the ultimate street battle called, no less, \\"The Streets\\" between the new crew and the old crew in a rain-soaked climax I won't ruin it for you (really, if you have to ask who wins you just don't get how formulaic this film is). This dance-off is well worth the wait as the choreography is spot-on. The scene could not have been shot with more skill, you can see how fluid the dancing is, nothing is chopped up which leaves the viewer in awe at how many laws of physics are shattered by the moves these kids are able to do!<br /><br />Another thing worth mentioning is the supposed-nerdy kid named Moose (newcomer Adam G. Sevani) who befriends Andie at MSA, he's a kid who we see is stuck in the wrong major once we see his entertaining freestyle moves. He makes the most of the character given him and probably saves the story that falls flat in between dance numbers. Maybe, just maybe, one day he'll be the Jason Biggs of a new generation.<br /><br />In summary, don't get me wrong, when I left the theater I was smiling and wishing I had those mad skills. You just have to know what to expect before you see the movie or you may wind up being too disappointed to really appreciate how superb the dancing is. Thus, if dancing is your thing, do lower your expectations as regards plot and characterization and run to your local Cineplex and you too will be wowed and blown away by the dancing as these kids Step up 2 The Streets.d who we see is stuck in the wrong major once we see his entertaining freestyle moves.

0765350386|5.0|I had heard of Brandon Sanderson before, but I dismissed him as just another new fantasy author. However, when I first heard he was selected to write Robert Jordan's last book in the Wheel of Time series, I wondered if this new author could handle such a monumental task.<br /><br />So, after reading the synopsis for the first book in his trilogy, Mistborn, it piqued my interest and I decided to give it a shot and see. I was very pleasantly surprised. The world is very realistic and believable, populated with characters you get to know and empathize with their struggles, and with a magic system (ingesting metals and \\"burning\\" them, with the people able to perform this feat called Allomancers) that was very unique and different so that it was refreshing. The author also decided to go a different route than your usual standard in fantasy, where the hero of prophecy didn't save the world, and instead we are introduced to a gloomy and bleak world, the Final Empire, that has been under the oppressive yoke of the Lord Ruler for a thousand years.<br /><br />The ordinary people and workers, called skaa, are looked upon as slaves. As objects and tools to be cast aside once they are no longer needed by the nobility, that \\"rent\\" skaa from the Lord Ruler, who owns everything in the Final Empire. In this depressing world, there is no hope and no one ever thinks of defying the Lord Ruler as all the skaa rebellions in the past has always been crushed.<br /><br />Into this picture we are introduced to a thief crewleader named Kelsier who burns with anger, frustration, and revenge against the Lord Ruler for past grievances. Years before, he was caught breaking into the Lord Ruler's palace and sent to the Pits where no one survives, but Kelsier managed to escape and since that time he has been planning to cause chaos and overthrow the Lord Ruler. Kelsier is not your ordinary skaa thief, he has Allomantic powers, and not your regular Allomancer but a Mistborn, one who can burn all the Allomantic metals. Kelsier rounds up his fellow thieves and rebels to undertake this ambitious and life-threatening plan, which includes a young girl with Mistborn powers named Vin.<br /><br />While Sanderson does not have as richly textured and detailed world as other well-known fantasy authors (the late Robert Jordan or George R.R. Martin for example), he does have a certain *something* that hooks and then reels you into the fictional world he has created. Not many authors can keep me riveted to the pages and wanting more, but Sanderson did it. I can now see why this relatively unknown author was selected to complete Jordan's last book! Sanderson is good. Really good.<br /><br />The characters of Vin and Kelsier were well-developed, especially the progression of Vin from a timid and wary skaa street urchin to a more confident and trusting young woman. I thought these two characters had incredible depth and emotion, and they pulled me in deeper into the story. I also felt the plot was engaging, with enough action scenes throughout the book to keep me turning the pages to read what happens next.<br /><br />Although this is the first book in a trilogy, it didn't end on a cliffhanger and could be read as a standalone. There were a few plot lines left dangling that will most likely be tied up in the later books, but I felt the conclusion was just right. I highly recommend reading this book.sier rounds up his fellow thieves and rebels to undertake this ambitious and life-threatening plan, which includes a young girl with Mistborn powers named Vin.

0345423496|3.0|The final (?) addition to Arthur C. Clarke's Odyssey series, it begins well and ends a bit flat. Still, if you have read the first three books of this series, you should read this one.<br /><br />The author begins the book well by resurrecting astronaut Frank Poole (2001: A Space Odyssey) and exploring human civilization in 3001 through his eyes. This is the strength of the book and makes it worth reading. However, when the author wrapped up the story concerning the monoliths in our solar system, it fell flat. Finally, the Epilogue attempts to keep the mystery alive in two sentences.<br /><br />Clarke's vision of the future is fascinating. He touches on both technology and social evolution. I find his vision of technology interesting, but his vision of social evolution mundane. He seems to be on the intellectual path that argues if something can't be measured, it does not exist. Since humans have limited capacity to understand and measure the universe, his story requires beings that that have greater intellectual capacity than humans, while still being part of the natural order. So, the monoliths and their mysterious origin are a critical part of the story. Then, when their part is completed in the final book, the Epilogue is required to maintain the mystery. But the viewpoint of the makers of the monoliths is not sufficiently discussed. If they are not omnipotent, then greater beings are needed in the story to account for their limitations. In other words, just add another universe - another layer of beings, and so on.<br /><br />I conclude, a la Shakespeare, that there are greater things in heaven and earth than are contained in Clarke's philosophy. Still, Clarke is to be commended for taking risks in writing about the future concerning technology, which I think is his great contribution as an author.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This movie was done in such an honest way.  It may not have the bells and whistles to keep you at the edge of your seat, nor did it alter the truth of the real story to make it comical in order to attract the masses, but it is a classically laid out, well done movie that will inspire you to keep running the good race to the end.  And if you are not running the race, it will challenge you to get off you seat and do something of real value.    Highly recommended.
0977326403|1.0|The high praise by many of the reviewers of this book makes me feel that Jim Collins had his whole staff send in reviews. He defines no terms including non-business entities, business thinking, and social sector; states there are valid ways to assess greatness without metrics but gives no examples or gives examples that ARE metrics; claims the use of business language is naive and then analyzes \\"non-businesses\\" (whatever they are, he never says) using the language of business (budgets, financial statements, annual reports, executive compensation, etc); talks about motivation as though he just discovered that money isn't all there is (think Maslow's hierarchy of needs); and talks about building momentum as though he never heard of successful companies whose success destroyed them because they FAILED to follow the rules of business (growing too fast, or expanding into activities too far removed from the core activity, for example). I have not read any of Mr. Collins' other works but this one is just befuddled. The only concrete statement he makes towards greatness is \\"hire the best people.\\" Duh. Other than that, I did not find anything that made sense in this work. It is filled with the illusion of ideas, that when looked at closely evaporate.

B000ZBPQEO|5.0|Simply put, there is a ton of music here -- 88 CDs comprising the complete EMI orchestral recordings of Herbert von Karajan -- all in a box smaller than a pair of shoes!  It will take me the better part of the rest of this year to listen to it all, but as I have already heard 3/4 of this music, I'll start with the things that have never appeared previously on CD, or have just been impossible for me to ever find.  By my count, those performances add up to more than a dozen discs worth of material, including some fascinating items like Kurt Leimer's Piano Concertos and Leopold Mozart's Toy Symphony, plus a Schubert 5th, Dvorak 9th, Tchaikovsky 4-6th and Wagner Excerpts from the 50s/60s to compare to his better known 70s accounts, and entire discs of late mono and early stereo orchestral bonbons from the 1950s with the Philharmonia.  Of course, it also features some of the greatest renditions of the repertoire ever made -- the Mozart Horn Concertos with Dennis Brain, his first of four Beethoven Cycles, the early stereo Brahms 2nd and \\"Unfinished,\\" phenomenal Piano Concertos with Lipatti, Gieseking and Weissenberg, the Don Quixote with Rostropovich, and the famous Beethoven Triple with Richter, Oistrakh and Rostropovich.  This set is obviously aimed at the most serious of classical music collectors, and if you fit that bill, do yourself a favor -- trade in those old single discs at a used CD store (or better yet, donate them to your local library), save yourself some shelf space, and get this once in a lifetime set.
B000BVQ9JO|2.0|I am new to the Strokes, but really wanted to like them after playing Reptillia on Rock Band. The music has a nice sound to it. It is sufficiently different enough, that I did not tire of it. The thing that kills this album is the limited vocal range of Casablanca. His voice is utterly average and it breaks all of the time. You get the feeling that someone in the shower could sing as well as he does. Lack of range and inability to hold a note are not good traits for a vocalist. He sounds best when he is just \\"talking loudly\\" during certain songs versus actually trying to sing. Sometimes his voice degenerates into words that cant be decifered. The vocals are somewhat akin to Thom Yorke's, except that Yorke has much more talent and he sounds better. Its a shame because Casablanca limits the otherwise decent music.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Viggo Mortensen's understated electrifying performance in this Russian mafia thriller will linger long after the movie ends.  A far more complex and minimalist character than that of Daniel Day-Lewis and his silly, over wrought Plainview psycho in the bloody pointless \\"There Will Be Blood.\\"<br /><br />The story may be somewhat familiar, but it's in the details of this London based tale that make it fresh.<br /><br />Mortensen's Nikolai is a man who says he has been dead since he was 15.  He is a moral force with nothing to lose.  A man beyond redemption perhaps who suddenly sees clearly what must be tended to in the battle of light and darkness.<br /><br />Croneberg's fascination with cut flesh is a little off-putting in the few violent moments and took me out of the movie.<br /><br />The fight scene in the bathhouse is the most intense I can recall.  Reminded me of the extended struggle in the train in \\"From Russia With Love.\\"<br /><br />Brutal and raw.  A great double feature with the London blackmarket body parts thriller \\"Dirty Pretty things.\\"<br /><br />Recommended.
B000IJ7Q32|3.0|In Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, Jared Diamond utilizes the comparative method to examine key factors that have contributed to the collapse of previous societies in comparison with current threats and opportunities facing modern day societies. In his book, Diamond defines a societal collapse as, \\"a drastic decrease in human population size and/or political, economic, or social complexity; over a considerable area, for an extended time.\\"    In his examination of past societies, Diamond acknowledges a set of environmental factors and human reactions to these factors as the driving forces of their collapse. One example he elaborates on is the complete deforestation of Easter Island and its effects on the cultural practices of its people. In his review of modern day societies such as the United States and China, Diamond recognizes technological advancements, globalization, modern medicine and having a greater understanding of past societies as factors that may place these societies at lower risk for collapse.          Conversely however, Diamond also points out that for the first time in history we are facing the risk of a global decline. Issues such as global warming and overpopulation are not isolated to specific societies. Furthermore, as technology allows us to continue to become connected with one another across international boundaries, there will soon be little chance for a society to collapse in seclusion.   Diamond offers two generic solutions to preventing a collapse of a modern society: 1) to employ long term planning for the future that incorporates making bold, anticipatory decisions on problems at a time when they are perceived but have not yet reached crisis proportions, and 2) to restructure our individual value systems as a society to accommodate to the changes anticipated for the future.   Throughout this book, Diamond utilizes traditional methods of examining the past in order to better prepare for the future. Insights and information on past societies are discussed, and readers are offered a point of view to invoke for thinking about the future. However, specific suggestions for thinking about the future are lacking, and no new knowledge or ideologies are presented in this book. Examples of how modern societies of all levels of development are changing as a result of rapid technological, environmental, or cultural change are also very thin, which may be disappointing to the reader. However, those with strong interests in history or anthropology would probably still enjoy reading this book.
0465011047|5.0|Not since [[ASIN:0374500010 Night (Oprah's Book Club)]] by Elie Wiesel have I read such a grippng story of a child's survival in the face of unspeakable cruelty & human suffering. Kang Chol-Hwan spent ten years in North Korea's infamous Yodok prison camp. After an alledged infidelity to communist party ideals by his grandfather, Chol-Hwan and his family were sent to the camp in the late 1970s when the boy was only nine years old. There he witnessed torture, suffering & death on a daily basis; seeing neighbors starve to death was a commonplace occurence. The courage & will to survive displayed by Kang Chol-Hwan in the face of such unimaginable horror is remarkable, although the experience did leave lasting emotional scars:<br /><br />\\"I think the camp also changed me psychologically. As a child, I was outgoing and restless. When people meet me today, they find me reserved & somewhat distant. Growing up in the camp made me shut myself off from the world. I learned about suffering and hunger, violence and murder. For a long time I was angry at my grandfather. Only around 1983 did I begin to realize that not he but rather Kim Il-Sung and his regime were the real causes of my suffering. They were the ones responsible for the camp and for filling it with innocent people. All during my childhood, Kim Il-Sung had been like a god to me. A few years in the camp cured me of my faith. My fellow prisoners and I were the wayward sheep of the revolution, and the Party's way of bringing us back into the fold was to exploit us unto death. The propoganda, which exalted North Korea as the people's corner of paradise, now struck me as revolting.\\"<br /><br />This book should be read by everyone who needs to be reminded how fragile human rights & personal freedom can be in the face unchecked evil. \\"The Aquariums of Pyongyang\\" is destined to become a classic story of the struggle for justice and human dignity.

B0011NVC9I|4.0|\\"Beowulf\\" is a graphic, animated interpretation of the oldest extant Anglo-Saxon poem about a heroic savior who saves a kingdom from evil monsters. In Denmark, 507 AD, the realm of King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is harassed by the giant demon Grendel (Crispin Glover), who slaughters and consumes even the stoutest soldiers at will. The King offers half the gold in his kingdom to any man who can rid them of Grendel's menace. Beowulf (Ray Winstone) comes from across the seas to take up the challenge. But even a man who slays Grendel may be no match for the demon's mother.<br /><br />This isn't the Beowulf of lore. The film follows the poem only loosely, just as the characters' appearances are vaguely inspired by the actors who portray them. This new \\"Beowulf\\" alters its themes to suit very different sensibilities than an medieval audience would have. That's what legends are for, so I can't object. Screenwriters Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary approached the story with the idea of incorporating some elements that the monks who preserved the legend for generations might have edited out. As director Robert Zemeckis said, \\"It's all about eating, drinking, killing, fornicating.\\"<br /><br />The story is compelling, but the animation sometimes gets in the way. This is motion-capture animation, which records the movements of the actors but leaves their features to artists' imaginations. Ray Winstone is looking delightfully buff. But the characters' jerky movements look more like stop-motion, causing some action scenes to resemble a Gumby brawl. \\"Beowulf\\" can't decide if it wants to look real or fake and so juxtaposes the two for an unpleasant effect. But the actor's voice performances are strong and very capable of carrying the film. I do wish the animation were more consistent, or at least interesting, however.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2008 Director's Cut): There are 6 featurettes, 6 deleted scenes, and a theatrical trailer. \\"A Hero's Journey: The Making of Beowulf\\" (24 min) explains and demonstrates the motion capture technique. Actor Ray Winstone allows us to watch while his face is fitted with electrodes and he dons his mocap suit.

0553381687|2.0|I read that when George Martin started writing the first of his originally plan four book series, he wrote only 1/3 of the first book and it was so long, he stopped, named it A Game of Thrones, and extended the series to seven books.  This decision shows in the book, as A Game of Thrones is not a complete story and cannot stand as an individual book.  Of course there is the larger arching story that will go through all of the series, but A Game of Thrones does not have a smaller story within the book that is completed at book's end while advancing the entire series' story.  The books just ends, with nothing.  I felt cheated and frustrated that I had read 820 pages to get...nothing.<br /><br />Nothing in that A Game of Thrones is only 1/3 of the intended story, and thus the normal progression of a good book is lost.  Characters do not grow, progress or develop beyond their initial personalities at the onset.  I hear that the characters grow in later books, but I find that unacceptable.  One should judge a book not on how it stands in a series, but on its own.  Each book within a series should be individually excellent, with a smaller story contained in the book, but also details that lend itself to the next book.  This book is incomplete and not a whole book and cannot stand without the rest of the series.  I wonder if this book didn't have the backing of the fantasy reader, if it would have gotten torn apart by the literary world as it is not enough as a singular book.

B0010ZR160|5.0|Ben Affleck, who proved he could write, with the Oscar-winning \\"Good Will Hunting\\", and act, with \\"Hollywoodland\\", now demonstrates a remarkable flair for directing, as well, in the superb \\"Gone Baby Gone\\". This gripping 'lost child' drama, cutting through the layers of lower-income South Boston, displays amazing sensitivity, and Oscar-caliber performances by a top-notch cast.<br /><br />Adapted from Boston novelist Dennis Lehane's best-selling novel, the film unapologetically views a neighborhood crushed by poverty, alcoholism, and drug addition, yet clinging to a stubborn pride. When a little girl disappears, the child's aunt (Amy Madigan), frustrated by the slow progress of dedicated cop Morgan Freeman, hires local detective team Casey Affleck (Ben's brother) and Michelle Monaghan to join in the search. Despite only cursory assistance from the detectives handling the case (Ed Harris and John Ashton), Affleck discovers a web of lies and deceit, starting with the child's drug addict mother (Oscar-nominated Amy Ryan). As the layers of deception unravel, questions of integrity and 'best interest' are raised, lifting the film far above a simple detective story!<br /><br />In many ways, Affleck's 'Patrick Kenzie' is a descendant of film detectives of the past, from Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe, to Lew Harper; a man with a code of honor and unshakable integrity, hidden beneath a flippant exterior, facing a world where morality and truth are colored in shades of gray. It is a nearly impossible situation, and Casey Affleck is extraordinary in the role, capturing the anguish of a man whose virtues might destroy any hope of happiness. Equally good are Monaghan, combining beauty, stability, and humanity, and Harris, whose true character unfolds gradually, in a remarkable acting tour-de-force.<br /><br />Ben Affleck's compassion and deep devotion to the people of the grittier side of Boston makes him an ideal storyteller, and provides an authenticity to each scene that only a 'native' could provide. This certainly doesn't 'feel' like the first production of a novice filmmaker...<br /><br />Bravo, Ben!. This certainly doesn't 'feel' like the first production of a novice filmmaker...

B000Y7U98C|3.0|I picked this up on a recommendation of a friend of mine because he had said it was one of the best science fiction movies he had ever seen.  Obviously by my rating, I wasn't as impressed, but I did find some merit within the smorgasbord of things that didn't make sense or were just plain incorrect.<br /><br />Okay, this movie is probably one of the most scientifically incorrect films I've come across and it's not an old movie (based solely what's presented in the film).  However, I realize that this a science fiction movie, so I'm going to check my scientific knowledge at the door and review the movie based on the story.  For those of you wondering what in the world I'm talking about scientifically I'm going to wait till the end of the review and I'll lay it all out for you, who knows, maybe people will learn something.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is that the Sun is dying and in order to save humanity they need to reignite it.  (This is primarily what's wrong scientifically, this will never happen in Earth's history as an inhabitable planet, but I will detail this out at the end.)  So I took off my scientific knowledge cap and put on my outlandish incorrect story cap to pretend this was actually feasible, because it's quite obvious Boyle didn't really consult any scientific publications or even talk to a High School science teacher about this.  (And before I get furious comments, I know about the Q-ball, just wait till the end.)  Regardless, the story is as it is, so let's move on for the time being.  So humanity developed this mega bomb to be put into the sun and hope that it would reignite the star, giving the Earth the life giving light.  It's actually an interesting concept philosophically, making everyone beg the question what we would do without the sun.  Earth obviously has been thrust into a major ice age freezing the planet solid. In this case I felt the cause and effect reactions were scientifically plausible.<br /><br />So now that we have this huge bomb we need to fly it out to the Sun and essentially deliver the payload via special delivery system because it needs to go beyond the suns mantel when it explodes.  (Not sure how realistic this actually is either.)  A team of scientists developed this huge spaceship with special shields to fly out towards the Sun.  However, we learn that this is the second of the space ships, Icarus II, and it was sent seven years later.  The first mission was a failure.  As they are approaching the Sun, Icarus II receives a distress signal from Icarus I.  They end up deciding to investigate and maybe get two chances at this highly theoretical proposal of reigniting the sun.  It turns out there is a survivor, obviously he's insane at this point, and also he is horribly burnt by the sun... I think.  Anyway, this is where I start calling the movie \\"Event Horizon\\", which seems to be one of the main influences of this film.  Sure there's some \\"2001 Space Odyssey\\" in there for good measure, and even a holodeck type of thing like we see in Star Trek: The Next Generation.  But when the movie turns to a bit of a horror film thanks to this new revelation, I must say it is predominantly \\"Event Horizon\\" in nature.  For the record I thought \\"Event Horizon\\" was brilliant, and also had its physics a bit better in concept and at least discussed them IN the film.  I will say this about the incensed murderer, everything he says is awesome.  It's like \\"Hellraiser\\" where whenever Pinhead opens his mouth it's always at the perfect time and he always delivers the perfect line.  One part in particular is when the murderer says \\"For seven years I spoke with God, and he told me to deliver all of you to heaven.\\"  Okay, so he's not as good as Pinhead, but he kept me watching and waiting for his next comment!<br /><br />The CG for this movie is excellent. I can't emphasize that enough.  You really did feel like you were out there with the astronauts.  I thought the acting was decent, not overly well done, but I enjoyed Cillian Murphy's character, though I thought he was a bit nonchalant about everything and that seemed a bit off... that's how he usually is in roles though.  The philosophical aspects of the film were spectacular as well.  Like what happens to humanity without the sun, and the killer clearly turning to thoughts of god zealously.<br /><br />The main misgiving I have about this movie that is not scientific is that they never once explain the killer's background.  Who is he?  Why is he doing this?  Why is he still alive!?  Why is he all blurry when the camera is on him?  It was pretty obvious that the Icarus I didn't look like it had been lived in, and the food wasn't eaten.  The crew appeared to have committed suicide?  Maybe.  None of this is explained.  You are left with SO many questions about this character that you start to wonder if Boyle is trying to be \\"in vogue\\", like Star Wars, releasing the second film first and later he will release the first.  Maybe that's why he did this and didn't explain the character, I kind of hope he does make another film about this guy he seemed pretty cool from what I could tell.  He's no Sam Niell from \\"Event Horizon\\" though, who played a very impressive bad guy in the end, but this guy ultimately got the job done.<br /><br />So why did I find the science wrong?  Well, first things first, in the commentary it mentions this theoretical object called a Q-Ball affecting our sun.  Well, here's the big problem, it's in the commentary.  Why do I need to watch the commentary to find out something as basic as this?  This theoretical object SHOULD have been in the god forsaken movie.  What kind of a writer seriously doesn't include this?  And if it was deleted why would you delete it?  It's kind of a fulcrum part of the plot.  Maybe this will be explained in the Icarus I mission... if that ever turns into a film?  See more questions, there were way too many questions from this film, and people aren't so stupid to just accept these things.  After watching a film that didn't make much sense, I wasn't exactly compelled to watch the commentary or any other feature on the DVD, but I had to learn the existence of the Q-Ball from some conversations on Amazon.  How pathetic can you get in terms of a story line, where the story makes sense only after you read Amazon?  Either way, this concept is not well outlined.<br /><br />As your watching this film with no knowledge of the Q-Ball in the Sun, you are left with your own pleasant thoughts about how impossible this is scientifically.  The Sun isn't even supposed to die in this fashion.  Oh and in an issue of Sky & Telescope they outline that the Earth really has about 100 million years left of inhabitable life on this planet.  The Sun is continually growing hotter and hotter, but this takes billions of years to really happen, so we humans don't notice it in our day to day lives.  What will eventually happen is the sun will grow so hot it will penetrate our atmosphere and eventually diminish the CO2 and make plant life impossible (no more photosynthesis), this does not bode well for animals that eat these things.  After this things just go down hill.  Furthermore Earth is in a veritable green zone of life right now, if this field gets pushed out we get too hot, or if it contracts we get too cold, either way it spells death for the planet.  In \\"Sunshine\\" we're in the cold realm, just to point out the obvious.  Anyway, as the Sun dies it will begin to grow and become a Red Giant, during this time it will literally consume Mercury, then Venus, and eventually earth.  This process is in about a billion years from now, if I remember correctly.  After a time in this state it will begin to shrink down again to a super hot White Dwarf star that doesn't emit as much luminance, then after another long stretch of time that power will eventually fizzle out and it will become a Black Dwarf and shine no more.<br /><br />Now, when you include the Q-Ballexplanation Sunshine becomes quite possible.  My problem here is it's not really outlined in the movie in the first place.  Who thought that was a good idea?  Anyway, a Q-Ball is a highly theoretical concept at this time.  From what I can find on it, we basically don't know a lot about them other than there is a math equation that proves they're possible in existence.  Anyway, it's this highly dense piece of dark matter that is affecting the Sun's ability to process normally, at least that's what I've been able to gather, I haven't looked it up fully in depth, but I'll be looking for books on this now that I know what it is.  It sounds vastly interesting.  For the record I never watched the commentary, I purely looked this up on my own.  I also had no idea this is even what the movie was supposed to really be about, thanks to the movies horrible ability at telling a story.<br /><br />There you have it, that's my piece on this movie that is diametrically reviewed it appears.  It does have its positives, namely the graphics, and some parts of the story line.  But it's highly fragmented story line makes the movie hard to follow and thus hard to enjoy in total.  I think it had an excellent premise at first, but throughout the film it really fizzles out and I even said to my friends when they introduced the main bad guy; \\"they better tell this guys story or I'm going to hate this movie.\\"  I didn't end up hating it, but the lack of his story really had an adverse affect on me.  A lot of people rave about this movie for different reasons, but I can't help but look at it in total.hat didn't make much sense, I wasn't exactly compelled to watch the commentary or any other feature on the DVD, but I had to learn the existence of the Q-Ball from some conversations on Amazon.

B0011KQSZ4|4.0|I missed this in the theatre and have been anxious for it to go to DVD.  There are scenes where I laughed so hard I cried!  There are scenes that I find myself remembering through out the day that send me into fits of laughter.  Who would ever think a funeral could be so humorous?!  The cast was top notch and the actor who plays \\"Simon,\\" should be given an award.  I highly recommend this film.  Its only 90 minutes but certainly worth the viewing!  ( I'm almost embarrassed to admit it but I've watched twice in two days. It was that entertaining.)  I won't bother to go into the story as it is all ready available -- but attest that this comedy is well worth the investment.  I'm just sorry that I missed it on the big screne and had to wait so long to see it.

All of the songs are just really great and it keeps the Pink Floyd style, combining a tad bit of 80's pop sound, I personally like it. No, it's not quite like DSOTM, or The Wall, but it is really good and David Gilmour sounds terrific on this album.

So many great songs on this album, a real thrill from beginning to finish. It's just great and any fan of rock/Pink Floyd should have it. It's a timeless classic.

I already have a lot of processes in place now that I credit for my business' success thus far, but this book helped highlight gaps and shortages in my systems planning.  I was reinvigorated to gain a better understanding of how my business can service its clients better.

The best part is that now he is writing in his own diary which I think is AWESOME and he discovered that he can draw cartoons!!
B0007YJ3UW|5.0|The Kalahari Typing School for Men by Alexander McCall Smith is a delightfully charming book and is just as good as the other books in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series.<br /><br />Taking place in Botswana, Precious Ramotswe runs the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency with the help of her assistant, Mma. Makutsi.  They now share an office with the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors company, owned by Mma. Ramotswe's finace', Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni.  The clients of Mma. Ramotswe have the typical problems including cheating spouses and missing persons.  Her biggest case in Typing for Men involves her client, Mr. Moletelo.  He wronged two individuals twenty years ago and he now wishes to make amends.  It is up to Ramotswe to find these two people.<br /><br />The character of Grace Makutsi plays a more central role in Typing for Men.  She now works part-time for the detective agency and part-time for the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors company.  She is struggling financially and fears that there is not enough business between the two companies to keep her employed.  She has the idea to establish a typing school for men.  She observed that men who use computers don't know proper keyboarding, but would be reluctant to attend a regular secretarial school.  The school also provides a love interest for Makutsi, which gets a bit complicated.<br /><br />For the first time, the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency faces some competition when Mr. Buthelezi, a former CID, opens the Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency.  Mr. Buthelezi purchases advertisements and gives interviews critical of amateur women detectives (a thinly veiled reference to Mma. Ramotswe).  But Ramotswe can tell him why women make excellent detectives.  \\"The trouble with men, of course, was they went about with their eyes half closed for much of the time.  Sometimes Mma. Ramotswe wondered whether men actually wanted to see anything, or whether they decided that they would notice only the things that interested them.\\"<br /><br />Typing for Men is a book that is beautiful in its simplicity--in the scenery of Botswana, in the characters, in the dialog and especially, in the simple lessons and common sense throughout.  I heard a rumor that Smith's books are going to be made into a television series.  If so, it will be something worth watching.that is beautiful in its simplicity--in the scenery of Botswana, in the characters, in the dialog and especially, in the simple lessons and common sense throughout.

B000YABYLA|5.0|Ellen Page is a really talented actor. If you want to get an idea of her range, compare \\"Juno\\" to \\"Hard Candy.\\" Ellen has great dialogue to work with, written by the quirky and smart Diablo Cody. Together they have brought a female character to the screen who is intelligent, funny, has heart, and is truly an individual.  Highly recommended for adults and older teens.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|The album is great especially if you enjoy their last album but I must warn you that this album is their softest album yet. A7X turned from metal with a little punk to punk with a little metal but with that said its still a great album just dont expect it to be like their early stuff.
B000TX7B5U|2.0|Unlike most of the reviews, I am not disappointed that this album isn't as hard as SOAD or that the talent is not there.  On the contrary, I think Serj definitely has talent, which wasn't used enough on the last SOAD record.  This album has an artistic side to it that makes it so different that you really can't compare this solo effort the former records.    My issue with this album is I feel like every song is the same thing, just with a different melody.  I realize that most songwriters write down what's on their mind, but I feel like enough is enough.  After listening to half of the record, I basically learned that if you believe in God of the war in Iraq, you're a bad person.  After listening to the second half, I got more of the same.    I guess what I'm trying to say that the album is fun to listen to.  The melodies are catchy and enjoyable.  Just don't try to read into the lyrics too much.  You'll just be disappointed.  Two and a half stars.

This is a truly inspirational book that reminds you that not everything is lost, that you can find light in the most terrible conditions. It's not new age, it's a story of survival and hope.  The second part of the book is about logotherapy. Victor Frankl was the creator of this discipline and it basically addresses the question of meaning in people's lives.
B00140PK6O|5.0|With Judi Dench and Eileen Atkins leading a superlative cast and a wonderfully witty script this show cannot miss.  I nearly cried when the  five hours were over.  But it is not just Dench and Atkins that make this  so wonderful.  They are ably abetted by Francesca Annis, Julia MacKenzie  and Imelda Staunton.  In fact every actor in the piece contributes to make  this the most watchable show in years.  I hope at next year's Emmy Awards  this wins several.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|This film contains a lot of information.  I used this in my high school anatomy and physiology course when I was going to be out for a few days.  In an educational setting it is important to note to the students that even though this is a documentary, not all of the information regarding the health care crisis is represented.  This film kept the attention of 17 & 18 year olds which is quite a statement for a documentary.

I just couldn't see it. Fortunately, I found it before I discovered Eckhart Tolle but it took a long time.    His series of Cd's has been very validating. He expands on the discoveries in my life and takes me further along the path than any other work of it's kind.     Best of all, it reduces the internal \\"noise\\" and makes possible a level of inner calm. The result for me is a greater awareness of what is happening, in and around me and to others as well.

0452286751|5.0|In my book, Ayn Rand still stands as one of the most powerful fictional writers capable of imbuing her work with philosophical ideals, and The Fountainhead is no let down. Yes, her characters can be a little one-sided, with unbending ideals they seem capable of upholding in the midst of the greatest strife. However, just being able to imagine and describe these kinds of intellectual pariahs and support their personas with such thorough background is a significant accomplishment.<br /><br />The only point at which this became unwieldy to me was during one of the final scenes, when court dialog is used as a thin disguise for Rand to rail on about her ideals through her protagonist and to tie some of the final plot knots. Normally, this would have been fine to me, except this diatribe goes on for quite a few pages. I considered lowering my rating to 4 stars in light of this grueling scene, but in the end, even this faux pas is excellently written and well-supported.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a must-read for anyone interested in the philosophy of self, individualism, and motivation. The only book in Rand's arsenal that tops this is Atlas Shrugged.

0975991477|4.0|As a retired hospice chaplain, I was particularly struck by Dr. Lipton's comments at pp. 145-147 where he discusses how it is that cells are either in a growth or a protection mode, and that a person's stomach lining is normally replaced every 72 hours. From my experience of having worked with approximately 1000 terminally ill patients, Lipton's account helps to explain much of the behavior of those who are dying as they reject nourishment of any kind.    If the body is in a mode of shutting down, then the process of stomach lining regeneration is in a mode of flight-flight from food which is now deemed as a threat. Lipton's analysis is the best way I know to help explain the process to those who insist on forcing the dying to eat.    The \\"Biology of Belief\\" is a very good read.
0061232084|3.0|Many people I know have read this book and rave about how good it is.  However it is really just a factual account of the events with no real insight.  The writing is ok but you are not transformed into the action.  You get no since of the pressure or the egos.  The characters are the real deal and the writes don't all you to understand them or even get you to like or hate them.  The book left me a bit flat but if you have no idea how companies are bought and offers are made it is still worth the read. If you know how companies are bought it is worth the read just to be scared to death.
B00004UFTU|4.0|The first full length album from UK prog-rock masters Marillion. Led by theatrical, Scottish vocalist/poet 'Fish' aka Derek Dick, and featuring original drummer Mick Pointer (Arena), keyboardist Mark Kelly, bassist  Pete Trewavas, and guitarist extraordinaire Steve Rothery. Almost every track is a classic: Script For A Jester's Tear, He Knows You Know, Garden Party, Chelsea Mondays. The playing is complex but never self indulgent, the songwriting far above the average for a debut rock album. Now and then the band sound a bit tentative, which is understandable given their youth & the fact that this is their debut. But this is one album no prog-rock fan should be without. Also, anyone who enjoys the music of Pink Floyd, Roger Waters, Kate Bush or Peter Gabriel. Outstanding.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I actually liked this movie quite a bit. I always thought that Kenneth Branagh was a good actor, but I also thought that four hours was a bit much, but the movie keeps the plot moving throughout the entire movie. Obviously, it may take about half an hour to catch up to speed with the Shakespearean dialogue, but after watching a bit of it, you'll be surprised at how fast you start to understand more and more of what they're saying.

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Michael and I saw this blockbuster. The Titanic hit an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. It was sailing from Southampton, England to New York. 1523 people drowned. 705 survived. It was believed unsinkable. The passenger list is a microcosm of society, and the tragedy has fascinated succeeding generations. Robert Ballard located it on the ocean floor and recovered its contents. James Cameron was inspired to make this film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are Jack and Rose. Movies do not get more romantic. Who can forget the image of the couple at the front of the ship? \\"I'm the king of the world!\\" Titanic won 11 Academy Awards. It is the biggest box office success of all-time, netting $600 million.
B000QEIORG|5.0|Musical taste is impossible to figure, so you might hate this album and still be a decent person. Maybe. But if you like FF, this is a high point you'd be wise to get. I say it's their best album alongside 'Echoes, Silence, Patience, Grace.' Since they worked with the same producer for both, they sound the most similar on those two albums. It's a good thing.  Honestly, I don't think there's anything truly wrong with this one. The music, the lyrics, the sound, it's all good. No, it isn't earth shattering, but it is really good, solid rock. And when they slow down, 'February Stars' is as good as slow ever gets.  The bonus tracks are a bonus, but nothing stellar. I already knew 'Down in the Park,' which I'd call the best of the lot. I might be biased toward it. They re all fun anyway, and 'The Colour and the Shape' (last track) is a blast, for those who think that Grohl screaming like a maniac is a blast.  I admit that FF is a bit formulaic, but it's a great formula, and this is the original. It's also a whole lot of fun... if you like the Foo Fighters. What's not to like anyway?

B00005JPUN|4.0|I had no idea that this movie was a remake of the 1978 version of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\".  That being said, I didn't see the original so I have nothing to compare this movie to.<br />The film opens with a very frantic Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) rummaging through the shelves of a pharmacy searching for sleep suppressants.  We are then taken back in a recent past where a space shuttle crash lands into the countryside.  From the moment that Bennell's ex-husband (Jeremy Northam) pricks his fingers on a foreign organism, life becomes a serious drag for the human species.  Bennell, who is a psychiatrist, doesn't get it at first when one of her patients irately claims her husband isn't her husband.  But it doesn't take long before Bennell figured out that all is not right.<br />This could have been an excellent film, but as is all too often the case these days, character development was not a priority. Beyond Kidman, character development was non-existent. How people are being snatched, also, is never adequately, not even remotely explained.<br />This was NOT a forgettable movie, rather quite memorable. Sure there was a bad ending, but my eyes were attached to the screen throughout the whole film. I didn't look at my watch once, and for me that gives this movie a big bonus.
B0007TKNIS|4.0|The film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is a sumptuous, costume-fest. A deformed musical genius obsesses over a singer at the Paris Opera House. \\"Looks are not everything, but if the looks are not there, I am not interested,\\" cousin Larry said. Even the phantom must accept that birds of a feather flock together and concede Christine. But the phantom outlives Christine and menaces Raoul by placing a rose on her grave. The title song is emotion charged. \\"Beneath the opera house, I know he's there...\\" I would have cast Minnie Driver in the role of Christine rather than as the comedic Carlotta. Driver is sexy.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|I think Erotica is the best album of this great artist. I love every song on it, I love it totally.
B00005JGAB|5.0|No matter how much time passes by, this album will stand as a testament to true punk music, and quite possibly the epitome of it. It's quite shocking, honestly, to see how so many guys and gals of my generation (this current one) have no idea what the real \\"punk rock sound\\" is. Well, don't worry, I'm not doomed to the same fate.  With a great production and lots of extra tracks, \\"Ramones\\" runs it at 22 song at over 44 minutes. This means that each song average out to about two minutes. While many bands can make great songs that last far longer, I still think The Ramones are awesome just the way they are. The songs are loud, hard, fast, and quite often funny. Between the energetic anthem \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\", to the horror-themed \\"Chainsaw\\" and \\"I Don't Wanna Go Down To The Basement\\", and even the punk-ballad \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\", this album really delivers.  Basically, \\"Ramones\\" is a fast-driving, ageless rock classic and shows you why so many bands inspired to be like them. If you wanna experience great music that doesn't give up, \\"Ramones\\" is gonna rock you! Thanks for the time, and peace.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|This is a lovely DVD. Bocelli and friends filmed on a balmy evening in Bocelli's home village in Tuscany at his Teatro del Silenzio. Be prepared to be engulfed by the music and the beauty of the scenery.
B00028HBKM|5.0|It was a year for politics and religion. Mel Gibson answered Islam in the wake of 9/11 with his faith in Christ as the only means of eternal salvation. He sought realism in using Latin and ancient Hebrew. He confronted accusations of excessive violence and anti-Semitism. In my astronomy paper, I prove that God does not exist. But the Holy Spirit reveals that God does exist. I had a religious experience at age 26. One night, I knelt beside my bed reading the Bible. I thumbed through the New Testament. Understanding poured into me. It was as if God pulled back a veil and allowed me to see the nature of things. The Holy Spirit showed me that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died on a cross for our sins and rose from the dead. The room lit up in an unearthly white light. It was an experience similar to the one Paul had on the road to Damascus. Jesus did not speak to me but revealed the essence of the New Testament as ultimate truth. I will never forget it. \\"Jesus\\" will be the last word on my lips. The word \\"Passion\\" comes from the Latin word for \\"suffering.\\" The \\"Passion\\" deals with the arrest, trial and crucifixion of Jesus.
B000JBXXZ4|2.0|As a longtime fan of Incubus, I thought Crow Left of the Murder was a great move for them. That was the direction I thought they needed to move and really showed them growing up. Light Grenades is HEAVY on LIGHT and LIGHT on GRENADES. It really has no soul and nothing to grab onto. It's just an empty disc with a track or two that are worth listening to. I haven't listened to the disc since it first came out. I was hoping Brandon and the boys would channel a little more angst about the state of the world and put aside the teenage emotions. Perhaps that's as far as they are capable of going. Let's get back to more Megolmaniac style writing and passion. Light Grenades is a major DUD.
B000WMFZMY|4.0|This newly released dvd of the wonderful El Cid is long overdue. The quality is fantastic. The musical score by the great Miklos Rozsa is inspiring, particularly the piece known as Palace Music. The extras are superb, especially the half-hour documentary on Rozsa.
B000002H70|5.0|Disintegration is the quintessential masterpiece album by the Cure. An epic novel in sonic form. Each song is layered with textures and containing a limitless quality, with effortless emotional expression, some of the absolute best lyrics Robert Smith has ever written and surely better then most song writers in any case. Dreamlike, Celtic and timeless. Disintegration cannot be dated like other music of the era. Like a good book it can be recaptured in any time or any place. Those of us that listened to it back then will be immediately catapulted back to the people we were then and the places we listened to it, feel what we felt again, the tastes, the smells, the dreams of all things. Love it!
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Michael and I watched this on TV from our room in New York City. I tried to explain it to him and to myself. It is from the Iliad written by the Greek poet Homer. Ilium is a word for Troy. Trojan Paris seduced Helen, the wife of King Menelaus of Greece. The Greeks sacked Troy, using a wooden horse to enter the city. Brad Pitt is Achilles, the Greek hero who kills Hector. Achilles dies when Paris shoots an arrow into his heel. Michael asked if the part about the horse was true. I said the story is half true and half made up. The Trojan War was fought around 1200 B.C. Homer lived around 800 B.C.
B000VBP38C|5.0|Excellent casting, story, acting, and photography. The HD format made the English country side and castle interiors magical.
0061122416|1.0|A friend loaned this book to me and I read it in two days, hoping to see what she saw in it.  I is drivel.  The characters are easy enough to like but if you're looking for a story that will change your life or help you follow your dreams..... I don't think this will do it.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Just when you think they've hit the top, they do it again.  This double CD is just incredible.  EVERY song is catchy.  Even the couple that I didn't care for, on the second CD, have grown on me.  They are so versatile that they go from ballads to blues to pure rock and roll all in one album and not one song sounds the same.  Vocals are great in that they harmonize most chorus parts and although some of the guitar rythyms and leads are simple, they are catchy and the music is FUN.  I haven't stopped listening to these two CD's for a month now since my purchase. These are two of the best CD's that I own.  Can't wait to have the top down in my convertible blasting this music on a warm summer day or night.  It's FUN and that's what music is SUPPOSE to BE!  Awesome!
B00003CXTG|3.0|A triangle of lovers set against the Japanese attack which pulled America into World War II. Kate Beckinsale is a nurse torn between Ben Affleck and his friend, Josh Hartnett. Both are pilots. When Affleck is presumed killed in Europe, Josh gets Kate pregnant. Affeck returns, and the two men clash in Hawaii. The attack on Pearl Harbor is emotional and drawn out. After Josh is killed in a raid on Japan, Affleck marries Kate and raises her son. There is no mention of the atomic bomb, which I considered an omission. The events of 9/11 occurred just months after the release of Pearl Harbor, making George Bush responsible for the global conflict of the 21st century. I made my way to Oahu and the USS Arizona Memorial. Beckinsale's beauty became apparent later on.
B0000029GA|5.0|What can I say that countless other reviewers have not? If you consider yourself a true Hip Hop fan, you must have this album.  Since I was only six when this album came out, I was introduced to rap by Eminem in High School. All I knew was what I heard on the radio until I started buying CDs.  At one point I was in the music store and found two CDs at a good price: Illmatic - the platinum version and Get Rich or Die Tryin. I had to make a choice between the two.  I made the right choice and picked Illmatic based on good reviews I read here on Amazon.  At first I did not get the hype, it all went straight over my head. I listened to it again and again until something inside me clicked.  Now, this is my favourite album.  Here's what I thought of each track:    -1. THE GENESIS 3/5 - Great intro, the beat is grimy and gets me amped up for the rest of the album. Listen closely for Nas's verse from LIVE AT THE BARBEQUE in the background \\"Street's disciple, my raps are trifle / I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle\\"(the only reason it gets 3/5 is because its an intro as apposed to a full song)    -2. N.Y. STATE OF MIND 5/5 - My personal favourite.  Some of DJ Premier's best work is on this album. The beat is dark and gritty.  There is an acute sense of a young man trapped in a dangerous world. It is tense and dark.  A Rakim sample for the hook completes it. \\"Heard a few chicks scream my arm shook, couldn't look / Gave another squeeze heard it click yo, my s*** is stuck\\"    -3. LIFE'S A B**** 5/5 - A killer debut verse from Brooklyn rapper AZ, though both emcees shine immensely. Both feel like they're trapped in the system. Nas has smoother flow, but I consider this song to belong to AZ. \\"Visualizin the realism of life and actuality / F*** who's the baddest a person's status depends on salary\\".  Minimalist production from L.E.S. is overshadowed by the more experienced producers, love Olu Dara's trumpet solo at the end.    -4. THE WORLD IS YOURS 5/5 - Some of the most poetic work from Nas. The idea that one can take they're life into their own hands is a startling contrast to the previous track. Pete Rock's production is jazzy and I like the hook he drops. \\"I keep fallin, but never fallin six feet deep / I'm out for presidents to represent me\\".    -5. HALFTIME 3.5/5 - An appropriate track for the middle of the album. It was Nas's first single, released on the soundtrack for Zebrahead two years earlier.  It is probably the weakest track on the CD, more or less because Nas is all over the place. However, it features some very clever wordplay throughout and interesting production from the Large Professor that sounds like a matching of jazz and jingle bells. \\"I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex / In your stereo sets, Nas will catch wreck\\".    -6. MEMORY LANE 5/5 - You can picture Nas sitting on the stoop writing hits lyrics, he paints pictures with his lyrics. Of course, Primo's supreme production helps.  \\"Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop / I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop, straight off the block\\".    -7. ONE LOVE 5/5 - A conceptual track in which Nas writes his friends that are incarcerated in San Quentin then he schools a youngster headed down the road to prison.  Q-Tip's production is spot on, the echoing sounds evoke images of jail cells. \\"Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul / only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style\\".    -8. ONE TIME 4 YOUR MIND 4/5 - Along with Large Professor's beat, Nas is laid back plus his flow is spot on. This one doesn't pop out as much as the other tracks though. \\"Ya'll n****s was born , I shot my way out my Mom Dukes\\".    -9. REPRESENT 5/5 - After chillin' to the previous track, get back up again for this high energy beat from Premier. I love bumping this on in the car. Nas is on point, representing the QB. \\"This n**** raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue / The school drop-out, never liked the s*** from day one\\".    -10. IT AIN'T HARD TO TELL 4.5/5- Nas lyrically kills this track. I did not give it 5/5 due to the lack of direction in this track that was present in the others. He averages about 4 rhymes every 2 lines. Some nice jazzy production from the Professor. \\"Inhale from the L, school a fool well, you feel it like braille / It ain't hard to tell, I kick the skill like Shaquille holds a bill / Vocabulary spills I'm Ill\\".    That pretty much covers everything.  Give me feedback if you agree or disagree.  If you're hungry for more Illmatic type material, check the internet for a mixtape called Pre-Illmatic.
B0012BTBQU|4.0|Brandon Sanderson seems to enjoy tweaking cliches; if not overturning them, then at least turning them on their side.  The Final Empire starts with a Dark Lord - the \\"Lord Ruler\\" - already ruling a 1000-year empire, a brutal feudal society covered in ash and afraid of the night.  Sanderson paints the society effectively and believably - the peasants, called \\"skaa,\\" are beaten down and powerless, but the Lord Ruler's personal strength alone isn't enough to rule; economic control and a powerful nobility allow him to keep control.    And so this is how a former band of theives - led by Kelsier, who discovered his magical ability in the Lord Ruler's prison mines - are going to attempt to take it down, with the assistance of the existing resistance.  Most of this is seen from the perspective of Vin, a thief recruited into the group after her own powers are spotted.  The secondary cast is reasonably well drawn, if underused, and fills roles actually important to the plot.  Hints of the story of the Hero of Ages who sought to save the world 1000 years ago previously work wonderfully.    The most time and effort, however, is spent developing Kelsier, Vin, and the steward Sazed.  On the plus side, this gives plenty of time with Sanderson's wonderful magic system, called \\"Allomancy\\".  It's a magic of metals, with defined rules and sensible consequences.  The fight scenes thrive with a solid basis - rather than lacking imagination or variety, it seems to have given him plenty of ideas for at least this book.  The plotting benefits also - the magic, and magicians, have consequences for the society at large.    While the core plot doesn't exactly innovate it's well-paced, not entirely predictable, and believable enough; and it actually reaches a resolution.  A well-written and very enjoyable fantasy.
B0000C1733|5.0|All of their greatest hits plus some other tracks.  This band is so talented at whipping up hits with simple chords, melodies and incredible singing it's unbelievable.  GET it.  It's GREAT! Two thumbs up for them.
B000JLTRKE|4.0|Oliver Stone abandoned conspiracy theories for a story of courage. Nicolas Cage is a police officer trapped in the rubble of 9/11. He and his buddy are rescued after baring their souls. Emphasis is on the families. Action is at street level. Only the shadow of the first plane against a building is seen as it flies toward the WTC. Subtlety works. There was not a dry eye in the house. I recall the morning of September 11, 2001. I awoke at 6 A.M., went into the bathroom, looked in the mirror and decided to shave my head. I had never done that before. I cut my hair, shaved my head, went back to bed and went to sleep. The phone rang. It was my mother. She was crying. She said, \\"They've hit New York. They've hit Washington, D.C.\\" I thought, \\"My God! We're in a nuclear war with China.\\" I was actually relieved when I found out what happened.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|They don't make 'em like this anymore. We are not so innocent now. We do not accept much on face value. Heston and Loren put the story of rocky yet romantic love in a clear and bright light. Triumphant. The Cid was unwilling to live with Moors and think of nothing else but killing them. Such a timely issue. Perhaps we too will live to see the day when unconditional love will outduel ignorance, fear and hatred.
0452289963|5.0|[[VIDEOID:18768211]]What makes this book worth Oprah creating a ten week class around it?  In a nutshell, it really does offer a genuine process for awakening from illusion of self and the pain that goes with that illusion.
B000001ESF|3.0|I bought this along with the Hemispheres CD. My complaint with this one is the same. They lumped the whole story side of the album on ONE TRACK on the cd!. It really sucks to not be able to jump to your favorite parts of the 2112 story. At least with the record album you could skip around! It's pure laziness not to separate the tracks to make it possible on the CD.
B000HT386M|4.0|Click is a comedy with a serious side. I saw it with Michael, and it made us think. We talked about life and death, love and family. The comedy is over the top. There is too much of the dog and chicken, and there could have been less profanity, but I feel that about a lot of movies. Christopher Walken is an angel of death, and although I do not like angels in movies, he fits. As Adam Sandler moves back and forth through his life by clicking a remote, it becomes apparent how much he has wasted. Life is short. Sandler can be boring, and I wondered how he has mades so many movies. I was intrigued with Kate Beckinsale. She is British.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|Always was a fan of mysterious, phantom sniper stories. Then discovered Steven Hunter's books on the Swagger men and was hooked. This movie puts many of Hunter's images on screen for us fans to luxuriate in. Thanks to the producers. And Walberg will do very nicely as Bob Lee.
B0000AK7A8|5.0|This show should be considered classic. Really love this show as it bring back fond memories
B000Y1ZXU2|1.0|I had a problem with the TWO copies I recieved. Both of them didn't play and I had to return them.
B00003CX5P|3.0|The Phantom Menace was ripped to shreds by the generation which waited 16 years for the Star Wars prequel. Fortunately, I am not in that generation. Devoted fans may have learned a lesson, not to expect too much from a middle-age writer who has made his fortune. The kid who plays Anakin has no personality. He exhibits no sign of being fated to become Darth Vader. Jar Jar Binks is controversial. Some saw a racial stereotype. I saw a duckbill dinosaur crashing into Star Wars from Jurassic Park.
B000QFAJ7S|1.0|I wanted to like this CD, really I did.  After BREAKAWAY, where Kelly gave in to RCA & produced a carbon-copy Avril/Ashlee/Christina type girl-pop standard teen-radio CD, I was really looking forward to seeing her get the chance to put her own artistic stamp on something.  She made her label a lot of money (as have several of the Idol alum) & deserved the chance to do her own thing.  But I grudgingly must admit that in this instance, that moldy old coot Clive Davis was right.  BREAKAWAY was a masterpiece compared to this unmitigated mess.  I've listened & listened for a catchy hook, deep original thought, or just the Kelly voice I loved on Idol, & all I hear is track after track with no discernable melody, cliche-riddled lyrics, & lots of screeching.  Most of the songs are like the ramblings you'd find in a teenage diary.  Her life is over because of one month-long bad relationship???  I'd hate to hear what she comes up with when someone really hurts her down the line.  But at least she's trying & expanding her horizons, right?  The softer tracks SOBER & IRVINE show a glimpse of what Kelly could become.  But now we hear that she's back to toeing the line, kissing Clive's [...] & recording BREAKAWAY Part 2.  How sad.  It will probably be lucrative for all if the kids haven't turned away from her, but it's disheartening to face the fact that money conquers all & that RCA probably won't let her grow into her full potential for a long time to come after this financial & artistic disappointment.
B000008CX0|4.0|This is a very good CD but it's not quite great. The main problem is the vocal melodies. They're just not as good as everything else. If you can't get enough of old-school thrash, then definitely pick it up-but don't expect any big hooks to sing along with.
B000BC8TBE|5.0|Although I was not following Mariah's career as close as I used to at the time of this release, I was very excited when I learned that the X-mas videos were going to be available for the first time on DVD (or in any format really). I give 5 stars to the Original Album and performances of the original songs. But I really did not like much the hip-hop versions of some of the songs and the animated videos. Otherwise this would have been a perfect package. But I guess they wanted to portrait Mariah as she is now and not the adult contemporary artist she used to be. My only major complaint is the quality of the new booklet. It seems that they lost the original artwork masters because the new booklet was obviously a copy of one from the old CD and the new track information was just added on the blank spaces because it is much darker in color than the rest. Hopefully next time they will have more consideration in doing a quality booklet, Mariah deserves no less.
0790733226|4.0|Carl Sagan's novel about contact with extraterrestrial intelligence was made into a movie with Jodie Foster as Ellie. Ellie is into astronomy as a girl and pursues her passion as an adult, working for SETI. Contact is made, and a machine is built according to instructions sent by aliens. Ellie is transported through a wormhole to Vega. She encounters an alien whom she perceives as her deceased father. The ending is inconclusive, which again shows we cannot seek reality in science fiction. Foster achieved notoriety when John Hinckley, the man who shot Ronald Reagan, said he did it to get her attention. Sagan got famous appearing with Johnny Carson. His Cosmos series led to dinosaurs and politics.
1582701709|5.0|As a therapist and life coach I am always on the search for meaningful material to share with others and to apply to my own life.  I have a huge library and this book & DVD is, in my opinion, the very best.  I tried the principles in it and within 3 days wonderful new things started happening.  We created a vision board with three pictures: a child to add to our family, land we wanted, and our dream home.  All three have come to pass!  !!  I could fill pages with similar stories I have witness and been a part of.  The principles are nothing new to me but the application was enlightening.  Many criticize the materialistic aspect because of their attitude about money. This DVD is not about money but about creating greater potential in life in relationships, health, finances, self worth, spirituality, and more.  It teaches of gratitude, forgiving, believing, working towards goals or vision, and accepting the blessing you receive knowing your thoughts, feelings, and efforts played a part in it.  I have witnessed miracles in the lives of those I share it with.  I have seen people overcome great trials and embrace happiness.  Having money is not happiness - neither is being poor and in debt.  A balance in all areas of our lives creates peace and harmony.      My advice is watch it, realize that \\"the universe\\" is God, and look for anything that pops out at you and then try it. If something doesn't feel right let that part go.  If your car had a scratch in it would you turn it in to the dump for scrap?  Remember: \\"When you wish upon a star - your dreams come true\\" - Walt Disney (who lived his dream)      My advice to those who don't believe - you are also living the principle of attraction even in your disbelief - \\"whether you believe you can or you can't - you are right\\" -Henry Ford
B0012K1ILW|4.0|Okay people, now you know Erykah doesn't obide by the rules, she creates them on her spiritual/soulful/creative journey. I've been waiting for this CD since Worldwide Underground and I must admit, Erykah had me scratching my head so hard, that I needed dandruff shampoo ;-) Her new style kinda reminds me of \\"Jamiroquai\\", the European artist that I adore.     I knew Erykah was gonna come out with something totally different and I knew I wouldn't catch it with the first listen. As I was driving my kids to school, I was like is this what I've been waiting for because the only songs that stood out were \\"Telephone\\" and \\"Me\\" so I played them over and over until I arrived at the J-O-B!!     But \\"LAWD\\" on the way home, the light started to shine and I'm lovin' Me, Soldier, That Hump, Telephone, Twinkle and Honey. I must say, I wished she show cased her vocals a lil more, but everyone knows that E Badu can get down like James Brown with the vocal range. Like the other guy said, you can't be into mainstream music and love this CD because it will go straight over your head. E Badu is my favorite artist and you really can't compare her to anyone but herself. This is what she was born to do and how many artist can take years off and still have people biting their nails for the next CD.     Erykah, keep doin' you and whether it's good or bad you must be doing somthing right, because they can't stop talkin' about you. As long as you and Jill Scott are in the industry, I'll always have something to look forward to.    We love ya chick!
B000683VI4|4.0|Romance in South Carolina. Noah and Allie meet in 1940 and fall in love. Their love survives the disdain of Allie's mother and a third party who temporarily wins her affection. The story is told in flashbacks by James Garner as Noah. He reads from a notebook prepared by an aging Allie as she sinks into dementia. Hearing their love story brings her back for fleeting moments. The couple die in bed together in the institution where she resides. I saw my parents and the passing of the World War II generation. This is a tearjerker.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Joe Wright does an amazing job presenting the victorian age on screen, giving  us that Jane Austin satire of the civility in the age. His direction in terms of segway to scenes as well as the scenes themselves are very moving and seem to put you in the world of Austin. It is a thoroughly enjoyable period piece, with truly colorful imagery, and a good tension between Elizabeth & Mr. Darcy...
B0000E6XH3|5.0|The animation is cool but I think you REALLY REALLY have to like Daft Punk to be able to watch this. I really really like Daft Punk so this was a no brainer for me. The music goes surprisingly well with every scene. The movie plays the Discovery album in the same order. The animators and story creator did a great job of basing it around the music.    If you like anime though you just might end up liking Daft Punk after watching this.    I tried getting my friends together to watch this and half of them were pretty bored since they didn't really like Daft Punk.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|great movie, you'll want to see again again to see what you missed or didn't understand the first time watched
B0010VD7EO|4.0|Usually when I hear a lot of hype about a new band, I tend to be less than impressed with the results. But every once in awhile a good band squeaks by. Mgmt deliver a quirky lil album that I can't stop listening to. The first single Time to pretend is good, but The Youth, Electric Feel, Kids and The Handshake are just way awesome. Check it kids.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I love this series... watched it on ShoTime and can't wait to own it! I'm such a history buff and I particularly love this time period and Henry VIII has always interested me. There are definitely moments where history gets condensed or ignored, but as for major events the basic story line follows them fairly well. And I love seeing this interpretation for how things could have happened, that maybe THIS is what the characters are like!    Plus, they're all so extremely attractive, and the acting superb... and does anyone else have an intense longing to get into Sir Brandon's tights?!
B000P2A256|1.0|...these are just some of the ways you can put your Maroon 5 CD to better use.  Seriously, did anyone actually listen to this album?  It's all the crappy music of the 70s and 80s revisited.  It's disco rehashed and reconfigured with a corny, electronically watered-down sound to accompany it.  This music is AWFUL!  This album would be better suited as a breakfest table.  It lacks the soul and the drive and the modicum of originality of their first release.  This is merely an offering of boring lyrics, hackneyed sing-songiness, and all the same chords and melodies of by-gone eras...and not even GOOD ERAS!  Why the hell would a band with so much talent and potential choose to follow up a soulful debut with disco/sounds of 80's pop trash?  What is wrong with this world?
B00013RC8O|4.0|I first heard of this movie as a slam-bam, chase flick.  Little of substance, much mayhem.    After avoiding it for many years, I finally took a look.    As the climax ended, I found I was crying.  It was so inevitable, yet by the time the car hits the barriers, you want him to stop, escape, live again.  Kinda reminded me of Dead Man, as this guy is taking a journey before he dies.  It is simple, revealing, heart-breaking.
B000GLKLCK|5.0|Exceptional! The first disc contains four concertoes written when Mozart was 11 years old; they are great but only a prelude to the fabulous music yet to come. I researched every credible reference I could find and they all declared that the Perahia/ECO version was the best. Though I have tried none of the others, the quality of this collection leads me to trust the veracity of those references. When you consider the quality of this music, six hundred minutes of divine music for a mere pittance is an incredible value. If you like piano music and if you like Mozart, this collection is a must.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first, but the cd is pure genius.  I love the weirdness, revolutionary, and new world order concept of the cd.  The production and lyrics are great.  Favorite tracks are Hump, Me, Telephone, Twinkle, and Honey.  Can't wait for Part 2.  SO sad real eclectic music is passed over too much nowadays for mainstream.  A definete treat for neo soul/alternative lovers.
B00005AG7K|1.0|This is a very bad rip from a TV show. You will find a much better copy on the internet rather than paying for what looks like a bad bootleg
1577312082|4.0|At the time I listened to the audiobook I really needed to hear it.  The ideas were not new, but timely for where I was in my life at that time.  Tolle reminded me of what was important. A friend who was having similar family and home issues recommended it and I could see the changes it had wrought in her, so I thought it might help and it did.  The \\"pain body\\" parts truly resonated for me and made a lot of sense - I knew exactly what he was saying.  Unfortunately, Tolle actually did say it: he did the narration himself and his voice is tough to listen to for four CDs, in fact, my daughter could not listen to it even though she was interested in the message.    Basically, this is a summing up of many Eastern philosophies, including yogic teachings, meditation, and Tao Te Ching. Mix in a little Christian theology, along with other major religious thought presented in a way the average person would appreciate, especially if that someone hasn't done a lot of reading and synthesizing of such ideas.    Definitely worth a read, or a listen if you can bear it.
B000U1ZV8K|4.0|This is great, you get all the LETHAL WEAPONS for the price of one. I got this today & am glad I got it. Im a fan of the LETHAL WEAPONS & glad they made this pack. I dont like the cheap case it came with its to thin (not like other DVD cases) but whatever, & why does it not have a insert for the chapters? All in all its great.
0321544080|3.0|This book is getting rave reviews.  If you are into artificial lighting and lighting accessories, this is a must have book.  However, for a person like me, who much prefers natural light, it is a very interesting read but not one that I would refer back to.  No doubt about it, McNally is terrific at what he does.  And because he is so outstanding, every photographer probably should read his book at least once.
B00005K9LM|4.0|Of all the Judas Priest albums, 1982's [[ASIN:B00005K9LK Screaming for Vengeance]] and 1984's Defenders Of The Faith are considered the most similar, both utilizing the dual lead guitars of Tipton and Downing to tremendous effect, both with pounding, precision drumwork and both with fiery vocal acrobatics from Halford.  And although Defenders as a whole, as great as it is, checks in a notch below Screaming, its top tracks - songs like 'The Sentinel', 'Some Heads Are Gonna Roll' and 'Love Bites' - are every bit as awesome as anything on Screaming For Vengeance.       'The Sentinel' is the epic side of Priest at its best, with lyrics (in familiar apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic territory) being some of the best crafted in the JP arsenal.  The forlorn lyrics to essential dark ballad 'Night Comes Down' are also a high point in Priest's songwriting.  'Night Comes Down' is one of the few slower tracks on the disc, providing an excellent counterpoint to the all-out assault on gems like 'Freewheel Burning'.  Also moving along at a lower tempo, the two-part 'Heavy Duty/Defenders Of The Faith' is a one-of-a-kind experience that I've never heard Judas Priest or anyone else do elsewhere.  'Eat Me Alive', which is another pounding, driving assault, is one of the more controversial songs in the Priest catalogue.  Really, what it's trying to do (I think) is be over the top and kinky, and I don't think it's supposed to be taken literally or - in the terms of certain phrases - seriously.  It's easy to see how some could be uncomfortable with it, but if you take it in the right light - like its phrases are deliberately tongue-in-cheek things that might be bantered about in loveplay or whatever, and are just non-serious plays on words, (much the same vein as 'Love me To Death' off the criminally under-rated [[ASIN:B0000630BW Ram It Down]]) it's actually a good cut; it's really just one line that kind of throws it off. and  The only song on the original recording that didn't really shine was 'Rock Hard Ride Free', which is a solid and listenable track to be sure, but just doesn't measure up to the rest of the album, despite having its moments.  Often times later in their career a band will go and re-record some earlier tracks with a new spin on them.  If Priest ever started doing that I'd nominate 'Rock Hard..' over any of their better-known tracks.  It's a good song that's got the potential in there to be a lot better.      The bonus tracks...uh, aren't the most outstanding bonus tracks from the re-issues series.  'Turn On Your Light', the studio bonus track, is good, a song that Priest diehards (like myself) will certainly want to have, but it's not exactly 'Prisoner Of Your Eyes' (the studio bonus track off Screaming For Vengeance) either.  It's good; I'd place it about alongside Rock Hard Ride Free, while Prisoner would be up there with any of the best original songs off Screaming.  The live version of 'Heavy Duty/Defenders Of The Faith' - well everybody misfires once in a while.  Again, it's a decent listen but it's so much less than how I'd hoped this would turn out live.  Part of the problem is that, while it's designed as a sing-along audience participation song, the crowd at wherever this was recorded doesn't seem at all into it, despite Halford's best efforts to get that energy going.  I'm wondering if this may have been recorded at one of the big 80s festivals, and if maybe the crowd just wasn't a metal audience and didn't know the song.  Even with a Priest Live/Unleashed In The East crowd though, this just wasn't the band's best moment live.  I'd really like to hear a live recording of this one captured on some other occasion, where perhaps it turned out better.        So there's a couple chinks in the armor on this one, but overall it's still a very high caliber, very essential heavy metal release, with a number of tracks that each would be worth getting the album for even if they were the only thing it had going for it.  And even theweaker tracks are still a lot better than much of what plays on the radio, in my opinion.  So it's still thumbs up, all the way.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie takes classic Beatles songs, creates multiple character stories all revolving around Jude and Lucy's love.  All names of characters are named after names of or in Beatles songs.  Most of the songs are sung live by the actors so that it would give a real and not lip synched feel which no one does in the movie business.  There are many Beatles references mixed into the movie that you pick up on if you look. Each time you watch you pick on more.  Also, they have put many of the feeling of the time into the movie along with many parallels to important people of the era that keeps you thinking.  Instead of creating a carbon copy of the Beatles songs (and no one can do it better than the Beatles), they have managed to deconstruct them to simpler versions that are extremely well done and creative.  The songs are almost like in old movies where you envision what happened because they lacked the visual aids to show you.  I like that you add the missing pieces in you mind instead of them given to you on a silver platter.  The way they used the songs to create the story is incredible because you will never think of the songs the same afterwards.  I laughed, cried multiple times, learned and loved along with all of the characters in the movie.  And to all of you that think it is lacking a plot, watch it again and guaranteed you will pick up more of the plot through the lyrics and you will see how well they really did develop the characters.  The problem is that you are so overwhelmed with everything and the characters that you don't get it the first time.  So, please do not complain about the plot until the second time through.  Plus there is only some 20 minutes of dialog in the whole movie, so you really have to listen to the music and the sounds and watch to really grasp it.  The best movie I've seen in years and the best musical movie yet.
B000063COX|4.0|The debut album of Iron Maiden came out in 1980, right in the midst of a crest where heavy metal was transitioning from a form that had thrived on maybe a dozen (at most) really good bands, into a vastly expanded field of music.  Around 1979 and the early 80s an army of new bands and albums poured forth, first almost entirely from the UK and by the mid-80s coming in force from America, Germany, Scandinavia, Canada, really all over the place.  One of the reasons I mention all this is that the opening track on Iron Maiden, 'Prowler', and the opening track off Judas Priest's 1980 [[ASIN:B00005K9LN British Steel]] ('Breaking The Law') have often occurred to me as the best possible harbingers of the entire future of metal, from the opening notes forth.       Apart from ushering in an even more vibrant era for metal than the 70s had been, 'Prowler' certainly does a tremendous job of announcing Iron Maiden to the world.  Instantly recognizable, heavy, and with stunningly paced guitar wizardry, the song was an excellent omen of things to come.  Although the music on this disc is somewhat different than the trademark Maiden sound (its immediate follow-up, [[ASIN:B000063COZ Killers]], was much more in sync with the bulk of Maiden's repertory) it immediately establishes one of Iron Maiden's most important aspects: the ability to fuse slow-, mid-, fas-, and ultrafast-tempo parts seamlessly into the same song, as witnessed repeatedly on here.  Some songs take it more one way or the other - 'Strange World', a quintessential 'soft metal' track (and aguably the greatest vocal performance by Paul Di'Anno, who sang on this and Killers before leaving and being replaced by Bruce Dickinson) is quite slow paced all through, and hauntingly beautiful, with mystical lyrics.       Title track 'Iron Maiden' finishes off the album, and this one probably needs no introduction to heavy metal fans: among the most classic of the band's material.  The weakest track on the album is 'Charlotte TheHarlot', which is kind of lacklustre but gave rise to an excellent track in '22 Acacia Avenue', its 'sequel' from [[ASIN:B000063CP6 The Number of the Beast]].  Another hitch is 'Running Free', which is great musically but hobbled by weak and ineffective lyrics.  The song, although lyrically unchanged, did come off much better on [[ASIN:B000063DHK Live After Death]].       Aside from those two relatively 'lesser' songs, the album is pretty much impeccable.  And without question, among the most noteworthy debut albums ever.
B0012K1ILW|1.0|I loved the last album, but could barely tolerate listening to this the first time through. I was ready for the soulful sound of her previous work, but really disliked the techno/funk beats. Her voice is to me what makes her music beautiful. This album had way too much music and not nearly enough of her singing.
B000WEMH3C|5.0|This cover is pretty self-explainitory.  It fits my grill perfectly and keeps the weather off it.  It is made of a gray durable plastic.  Where I live in South Carolina, this cover is perfect for me because it snows maybe once a year here and just rains a bit besides.  If you live in a climate with harsher winters, like Colorado, Michigan, or upstate New York, i would recommend getting the Weber Premium Grill Cover Instead.  It will probably hold up to the harsher climate a little better.
0316113077|3.0|Well I read the reviews and I favored those that gave great reviews, but not without some serious thought to those that had issues with some of the recipes as it is just as important to me that recipes work.      The ideas and finished product are fabulous as is the lists and decorating techniques that are covered early on. But the recipes.....I don't know.    I've made both of the cookies recipes and while I finally figured out the vanilla one (I've got better in my arsenal), I never could quite grasp what needed to change in the chocolate one. It had an odd texture and even stranger flavor once I got past the fact that that recipe wasn't going to produce a nice firm cookie that would hold it's shape during baking.    I'm wondering if, like many artists I know, including myself, if these recipes came about after the fact and after prompting for something materialistic. If that is true, the science that that is so important to successful baking was complete disrespected.     I will keep this book because I am quit impressed and appreciate the artistry and executed decorating techiques. However I will use recipes from bakers I've come to trust and respect because of their consistent workable successful formulas.
B000W1TJ7W|5.0|Every once in a great while, a band puts together a group of great songs: well-written rockers with exceptional production. Even more rare is to find all those songs on the same studio album. Rush's \\"Moving Pictures\\" is just one of only a few \\"perfect\\" albums out there. Every song on this album is a must-have for any serious music listener.    Every song rocks in its own distinctive way, while still retaining the complexities of the signature Rush sound. From the opening power chord of \\"Tom Sawyer\\" to the mellow fade-out of \\"Vital Signs\\", the listener is engaged in a mystical, musical world of fantasy, superstardom and social commentary.    On stage, Rush acknowledges the popularity of the entire collection of work on this album, as, except for the epic, synth-heavy \\"Camera Eye,\\" they have recorded each of the songs on various live albums (I wish they had also included \\"Camera Eye\\" somewhere along the way). Few Rush fans would object to an hour long set of this entire album performed live, in living color!    If you hav never listened to this album, you are missing out--grab some headphones, sit back and get ready for one of the best musical experiences you will ever have. You must get this album!

B000WZAE1I|5.0|This is a very enjoyable movie that is fast paced and full of adventure. Several different storylines are linked to the event of the \\"falling star\\". These stories come together and create a roller coaster ride between comedy (sometimes quite dark at times), thrills, fantasy, and romance. There are some great acting scenes by well known stars that add to the fun, especially the \\"Lightning Gathering Pirates\\" and their flying ship.    While some of the scenes might be too intense for the \\"wee ones\\" it is still a movie that can be enjoyed by the family if the \\"Harry Potter\\" films are their cup of tea.
B001041JLE|4.0|Suffice it to say that the original 1982 release of [[ASIN:B0000025RI Thriller]] was probably the most serendipitous moment in modern pop music history - the ideal melding of a young and uniquely talented entertainer seamlessly crossing established genres and a powerful veteran producer used to breaking the rules. A quarter century later, the result of their collaboration still kicks into high gear with unbeatable hooks and sharp production values. Sure, there is a discernible sheen of eighties gloss to the music, but each song is still a pop gem. Only two of the nine original tracks, \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"The Lady in My Life\\", were not released as singles, and they are consequently the least recognizable to my ears. The rest have passed on to our collective consciousness with a few sounding even better with age - for example, \\"Human Nature\\" sounds even more sophisticated today thanks to the fluttery Toto-esque arrangement , while the insistent beat and bass line of \\"Billie Jean\\" remain timeless.<br /><br />The audio tracks beyond the original album are bound to disappoint, and for the most part, they do. Vincent Price's 24-second voiceover introduction to \\"Thriller\\" is inexplicably added here, even though it would have made more sense to insert it before the \\"Thriller\\" track if at all. The last song on the disc is an unreleased track from the original sessions, \\"For All Time\\". Sounding like an overproduced variation on \\"Human Nature\\", the song likely contains some later overdubbing since Jackson's vocals sound discernibly older than the rest of the album. The five remixes are a variable lot. The least inspired track is \\"Beat It 2008\\", a knock-off the original where Fergie duets with the young Jackson voice with barely any distinction. The Kanye West remix of \\"Billie Jean 2008\\" also disappoints, as West slows the song down to a frustrating marching-band tempo in order to add a heavier bass line and louder strings. Better is will.i.am's approach to \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing) 2008\\", which brings a real snap to the lithe original. Reworking arguably the weakest song on the original recording, he remixes \\"This Girl Is Mine 2008\\" by substituting Paul McCartney's vocal for droning rhymes and a rap interlude.<br /><br />The best of the bunch is easily \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something 2008\\", which Senegalese-American hip hop/ R&B singer Akon slows at the outset and brings more seamlessly to percolating life with honest-sounding world beats. The accompanying DVD contains the predictable elements - the groundbreaking MTV-saturated videos for \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", and his fourteen-minute, special-effects-laden opus, \\"Thriller\\" directed by John Landis, as well as his career-defining performance of \\"Billie Jean\\" on the \\"Motown 25\\" special (1983). All are worthwhile to have presented on one disc, and the youthful Jackson peaking in his early twenties showcases a vibrancy of talent that remains timeless. At the same time, the images, reinforced by the photos in the lyrics booklet, leave me with a sense of melancholy over what has become of Jackson in the intervening years. If it's possible to cast aside the media glare from his personal idiosyncrasies, it can be agreed that he produced at least one album for the ages. The extras presented with the 25th Anniversary Edition seem all the more superfluous by comparison.2008\\", which brings a real snap to the lithe original.

B000ZLFALI|1.0|\\"Across the Universe\\" enters the pantheon as the all-time worst movie ever. Worse than \\"Sound of Music\\"; worse than Spielberg's unbroken scat-trail of bombastic droppings. Anyone who loves the timeless tunes of Lennon/McCarthy will be repelled by the clumsy, deadening covers, which turn them into vapid sonic sludge. The butchered songs have been crudely grafted onto vulgar, trivial, kitschy scenes and characters, which completely fail to engage one's interest or emotions.<br /><br />Disbelief turned to anger as I watched the relentless vandalizing of the Beatles' artistic legacy by Julie Taymor, the talentless hack of a 'director.' Bono, appearing as the sleazy huckster that he is in real life, is the unquestionable nadir among the dismal cast. Costly, distracting, blinking, swirling special effects will induce nausea in most, while provoking seizures in epileptics. These amateurishly awful effects set a new record for artistic value subtraction. The 'Sixties-style' sets and wardrobes are a vile, dogged parade of cringe-inducing aesthetic horrors.<br /><br />I'm just glad John Lennon isn't here to see his work mocked and slimed and trashed by this execrable exercise. Yoko Ono should sue for slander, and demand the destruction of every extant copy. The true, unforgivable crime of \\"Across the Universe\\" will be queering many impressionable young viewers on the Beatles' music forever -- as well as making the airtight case that elderly, increasingly senile Baby Boomers are birdbrained, narcissistic twits who deserve to be shunned, if not euthanized.<br /><br />Horrible, horrible, horrible; the veritable quintessence of horror! Why does Amazon not permit zero-star ratings?

Fave Tracks:  Master Teacher - I like how the track changes, and the chanting of \\"I stay woke\\"  That Hump  Me  The Healer  Telephone    If it rubs you the wrong way the first time, I encourage you to continue to listen to it. It's not bad.    PS - It's interesting to me the number of people who didn't like Worldwide Underground.  I liked it.  Mama's Gun is my favorite of all of her albums, but I'm digging her challenging the norm on this one.    Happy listening!
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|I liked seeing the magnificent Kate Blanchett as a woman warrior in full armor like the heroine of a Renaissance epic. It was nice also to glimpse the Renaissance magus, Sir John Dee and the masque was suggestive. But not enough was made of these moments.    Mostly, I missed Sir Francis Drake. It was weird having the Spanish Armada without him being called away from playing bowls. And there was hardly any discussion of the fire ships and singeing the King of Spain's beard at Cadiz. It is even  more odd when you think that there are so many plays and histories and even science fiction (Dr. Who) that could have provided inspiration (not to say incident). Then, too, this was the age of the most glorious English poetry and prose -- instead we had uninspired dialogs indoors, telling not showing, and long long intervals of  silence.     The first Elizabeth had the massacre of Saint Bartholomew in Paris and a wonderful moment when Elgar's Enigma variations are played as a background to a hidden Catholic altar.     This one was seemed flat and impoverished.    Still, I would give it three stars because I'm a sucker for costume dramas.

B00004RD54|5.0|To echo what many Amazon reviewers have expressed, this record turned my (musical) life around - I was a college student, focused on Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Grateful Dead, Who, Rolling Stones, etc. - the only thing I knew of Lou Reed was \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\", which I had dismissed with \\"This guy can't sing!\\".  THEN in 1974 a roommate brought this home and I was transfixed.  Yes, the entry was made easier by the dual guitar attack, which was pretty popular in those days - but the subject matter and Lou's vocal stylings were like nothing I'd ever heard before.  This record led me to the VU's \\"1969 Live\\" (also released in 1974, I believe) - then with Patti Smith's \\"Horses\\" and Lou's own \\"Coney Island Baby\\" from 1975-76, and \\"Ramones\\" in 1976, my world totally changed and I've rarely looked back.

I played the vinyl the death, and still have it, I love the new remastered CD. If you like progressive music and don't have this album, what's wrong with you!
B0011FXLCC|5.0|For the faithful, the Goldfrapp journey began long before Goldfrapp the band even began. Single after single, album after album, the eyes, ears and mind of the fan were treated to an intoxicating blend of styles, genres, rhythms, flavors and hues. If you are looking for more of the upbeat, techno numbers found on Supernature, look backward in their catalog to Black Cherry and the remix album We Are Glitter. If you're eager to move forward, this is the album for you. Slow. Lush. Haunting. Achingly beautiful. A sublime journey reminiscent of the Felt Mountain atmospherics. The big question is - REGULAR edition or DELUXE? I bought the deluxe and have little to regret. The box, lyric book, postcards and poster are all gorgeous. The DVD, however, is a huge letdown. When they say \\"A Short Film\\" - they're not kidding. It's just a few minutes of grainy nature footage peppered with Allison frolicking about - set to some generic Electronic Press Kit quotes about the band's process and inspiration. Yawn. As for the A&E video - cute, but Kate Bush did the same thing 20 years ago and you can see this video anywhere. So. ALBUM = A; Packaging = A; DVD = C-

As a history major, I admit my skepticism when my folks recommended I watch it, but I have been most pleasantly surprised!    While the history is sometimes accelerated or slight minor details are altered, the show does a fantastic job of weaving all aspects of the \\"King's Great Matter,\\" and all of the variables of the English Reformation into the story line with general accuracy while still managing to be greatly entertaining. Filmmakers have taken such measures to stress the deep seated emotion and worry held by Henry VIII in regards to his inability to produce a male heir, and secure the Tudor dynasty in England.    The acting is superb, the costuming is a parade for the eyes, and the filming intense. This show captures your imagination and intrigue from the very start. It's got all of my college friends saying \\"Henry VIII was a rock star!\\" My girlfriends all saying \\"What would Anne do?\\"    Start watching The Tudors and before you know it you too will be shouting \\"I am the king of England!\\"

B000VECAC6|5.0|This review is for the Blu-ray release of the movie only. For a critical review of the movie itself, there are many others available (although, for the record, I think this is a funny and a recommended film).  Like the other Monty Python movies, I first saw this film when it was released to theaters in the USA many years ago. My memory of it was that the colors were not particularly lush and that the film had that 1970's more-grain-than-it-needs-to-have look. I have not seen the film since, so either my memory is wrong or someone has done something very right with this high definition transfer -- Visually, this is an excellent transfer and release to Blu-ray disc. Do not expect it to be as sharp and detailed as the high def restoration of the large negative Vista-Vision originated film \\"The Searchers\\", nor is it as fine grain and colorful as a recent film like the Blu-ray disc release of \\"Hairspray\\", but, for this type of film, this is something close to perfection. The source material must have been in good shape (and the transfer contains no dirt or print marks!). More color than any Python film in my memory. The film is sharp and yet there is no \\"objectionable film grain\\" (and this is rare, as often when they transfer an old film-to-HD or Video, they use so much \\"grain reduction\\" and \\"dirt fixing\\" technology that they turn the image into a soft mush -- That is not the case here.) I could not have predicted a better job.  My only complaint is with the sound mix. While as clear and clean as one might expect, this slight re-mix for 5.1 digital surround has done what so many new movies do today: If you set the level right for the music, the dialogue will be so low as to need subtitles. If you set it right for the dialogue, you will have to cover your ears because the music will blast you out of the room. This seems to be a common arrogance on the part of sound mixers today -- Because we have such dynamic range in audio recording & reproduction today, the sound mixersuse it to an extreme that no one concerned with the aesthetics of good sound mixing could or should accept. Fortunately, there are only about 3 or 4 places in the movie that this is a problem (Warning: One is at the start of the movie), and the excessively loud music is over points in the movie that are not inter-mixed with dialogue (so, while it is wrong and one should not have to do such, just keep the sound remote control handy).

B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD takes the listener on a journey through the essential three periods of The Beatles' music. Since those tunes are radically different on each end, any newcomer to The Beatles (living on Venus? *.* ) might experience a little confusion as to how this may have happened. The answer to that is probably to listen to the \\"Anthology\\" on 6 discs.<br /><br />In any case, these are the biggies that we heard on the radio, AM when The Beatles first got rolling. I savoured most of these early tunes on crystal clear powerhouse WOWO Radio AM, Fort Wayne, Indiana, which was hundreds of miles west of my home in southeastern Ohio, on warm summer nights. During the daytime, when WOWO powered down, we listened on WKEE AM (\\"KEE Radio,\\" Huntington, West Virginia), which was one of the first rock stations to ultimately make the jump to FM in our region.<br /><br />Nostalgia aside, I bought this CD practically on the day that it was released. If a person owned only one [The] Beatles album, I guess that this should be it. If one only cared for the middle, \\"psychedelic period,\\" then they should probably go for either \\"Sargeant Pepper's\\" or \\"The White Album\\" (see my full reviews of those fine works).<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is \\"Top 40\\" stuff so the listener definitely misses out on the brilliant nuances of The Beatles' more obscure works which is, in my opinion, what launched them as a mega-music-machine, given the additional boost by both Brian Epstein and George Martin. In the old \\"33 RPM\\" days, (and in the 8-Track ones... YIKES!!!), we listened to The Beatles albums in their entirety, not really honing in on a single hit song so much, (although the 45 RPMs were certainly available and popular with some).<br /><br />Still, this is a super compilation and, albeit it comes off as a bit of a mix-match of tunes, I'm glad it's available as long as people know what to expect when they buy it.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I will always be thankful to one of my greatest friends for introducing me to Dexter. Before that, I was familiar with the gay undertaker of Six feet Under played by the incredible Michael C. Hall who gives here in his character as a blood spatter analyst moonlighting as a Terminator a spectacular performance. Once it lands, it hooks you in.   Dexter is a series it is impossible to dismiss and you should watch it even if you cannot stomach gore and the most gruesome scenes.   Although the Six feet under character and the one in Dexter can never be intertwined, they both have death in common, though David/Dexter deal with it in a somehow totally different way, but still intriguing.      I was TOTALLY happy with my purchase and I can't wait now to have the second season. And I am looking forward to watching the Italian release, just to check out how the dubbed version would sound.
0142407542|5.0|This has been the \\"must read\\" book at our house for six months straight. The three year old has not tired of it!  Amazing. He knows every phrase and allows NO substitues. Perfect!
B000002MK8|5.0|Some time ago, oh, I would say 13 or 14 years ago, my beautiful guide Marshy came to visit me. She brought with her some newspaper clipping she wanted me to see. \\"Look Metamorpho, it's a contest for a Charlemagne look alike\\"!, she cooed. \\"I think you could win it! You have that stern and wise ruler over a domain look you know\\"? \\"You think so\\"?, I asked. And then I quickly lunged for the mirror. \\"Yes, I believe you're right\\", I said as I examined my noble profile and saw a few pimples that needed immediate care. \\"Sign here. I will submit it\\", she said, as the words came out her ruby red lips and glistened in the sunlight. I did as she asked. I realized she was hypnotizing me into this, and, I didn't care!<br /><br />So, as you would know, I won the contest. In truth, it was quite easy when all the other contestants looked like Wallace Beery. The prizes were an unsold Yugo, boxes of bird seed, books by Hemingway with pages #49-#63 ripped out of each one, and a copy of Rod Stewart \\"Unplugged...and seated\\". I wonder if the real Charlemagne would have stood for this?<br /><br />Disgusted, I threw everything away, except for the c.d. which I threw, unopened ...and seated into my archives. It remained that way until after my current lecture series, titled simply \\"Closure: Metamorpho's Easy 12 Step Program to Whisk Away Annoying and Irritating Events in the Past that Have Absolutely No Bearing or Relevance Now Except that You Think It Does\\". I've been told the title is too long. At least fans of Kubrick like it.<br /><br />Anyway, good news to report! Rod Stewart \\"Unplugged...and seated\\" is a virtual GEM! Rod, as we know, have had his ups and downs in his career, but this c.d. is a vast treasure of all the elements that have made him exceptional over the years. All the aspects of his artistry are on display here, and he covers alot of terrain; from hard rockers, melancholy ballads, love odes, known hits and hidden treasures. There is something here for everyone to like. It is such an enjoyable proffering that I (almost) have nothing more to say. But, I will anyway.<br /><br />When thinking of the songs included, I can only marvel at the supreme wise choices they made. Admittedly, Rod's archives overbrim with tunes. And, within this format, there is only time for so much. So, selection becomes an imperative concern. He wisely chooses songs that he did with The Faces, great selections from \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\" and other winners from his solo career.<br /><br />The backing band is professional and expert in bringing out every sound and shades of colour that we've heard in his studio cuts over the years. They are right on in their affect on every song. There is not a bad cut here, void of missteps, remarkable for live sound. Well, for a singer of Rod Stewart's stature, I would expect nothing less.<br /><br />He starts off with \\"Hot Legs\\", the correct choice to start off the evening. Tones it down to bring you the lovely \\"Tonight's the Night\\" and moves into an underappreciated gem from his first solo album, \\"Handbags and Gladrags\\". Then, for me, the best moment and best song here. Rod exclaims \\"Here's Ron Wood\\"! (his bandmate in the Faces and now a Rolling Stone) and then they kick into \\"Cut Across Shorty\\", a rockin' cut from Gasoline Alley. A tortoise and the hare tale about Shorty winning Miss Lucy's hand. This is a great tune.<br /><br />Aside from all the considerable compositions from \\"Every Picture etc.\\", all done expertly, Rod also includes other notable songs worth your consideration. The spiritual beauty of \\"People Get Ready\\" is given a revered treatment. The lovely \\"Have I told You Lately\\" is also on hand. And the sadness and melancholy of \\"Tom Traubert's Blues\\" and \\"The First Cut is the Deepest\\" has some of Rod's best heartfelt vocals. The shades and moods here are the finest.<br /><br />But, through the peaks and valleys, Rod brings your spirits up again with the closing numbers \\"Stay With Me\\" and \\"Having a Party\\". No,Mr. Stewart is not going to send you away with the weight of the world on your shoulders. There are 15 songs here. Rod's 15 step program. I fear this may be better than my 12 step program in many, many ways. ;)<br /><br />So, in closing, this c.d. is a real treat. As you know, I had to endure personal trials to bring it to you. But what I have learned, and maybe you folks have learned it too, is that there may be some hidden good in the situations that we feel are complete disasters. In this case, there certainly was. Music fit for a Emperor, methinks.<br /><br />Excathedra! ----- Metamorphohe world on your shoulders. There are 15 songs here. Rod's 15 step program.

0142501123|5.0|My 3 1/2 yr old grandson LOVES this book. Great pictures Just enough drama! Discovery possibilities on the pages for a second look. Wonderful pictures and some anticipation on the right hand pages of what will come when the page is turned.
B000SXMQ24|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out.  I only listen to it when I have time to listen to the whole thing.  It's like watching a favorite movie.      The sound quality of the instruments and sound effects are amazing.  The story is creepy, psychotic, a bit disturbing at times, and just an amazing imaginary masterpiece.      Highly recommend this if you are going to occasionally listen to the whole thing.    Enjoy,  Jmck
B000OLGCI4|5.0|i'm forty eight and still love this story , I got this to watch with my grandson. I have it on vidio but this dvd is so clear and sharp  and with extra seans it is still a great movie forty years later!
B0010V4TZU|3.0|This album starts off strong with several bright, breezy tunes, but eventually the conceit wears a little thin.  Musically its been done before and better, both by the original African and other American/British musicians.  And for an album barely over 30 minutes, the second half is very bland, with at least one awful song (Blake's Got A New Face).  Perhaps a rush to get something out while there was some buzz about the band?  I think it would have been better to put out a strong EP and leave us wanting more.  A decent start but not great, and I'd like to see where they go from here.
0684830515|3.0|Written in first person, a journalist for an American newspaper meets up with friends and acquaintances in Paris France.  The characters are unlikable: spoiled and self-centered.  They begin their escapades frequenting restaurants and cafes overindulging in alcohol.  Three of the men are infatuated with one of the women (a tramp) in the circle.  The party (both definitions) then moves on to Spain, continuing to live-it-up: they go on a fishing trip, take part in the Fiesta and go to the bullfights.  They end up meeting back in France to say their good-byes.      The novel is typical Hemmingway: the themes are familiar, it is full of dialogue, and reads like a report----banal.  I think it lacks depth and is overrated.  In wonderment, I still find myself reading his work.  What I enjoy is his ability to go against the rules of writing.  And how much of his stories are his experiences?    Wish you well  Scott
B000PFU7OO|1.0|i am not inspired to expound beyond the title of my review... this middle of the road moaning is completely unimaginative and really doesn't deserve analysis. i can not believe how anyone could possibly enjoy this. i actually  wish i didn't feel this way - i don't like panning someone's artistic work, but in this case i would feel remiss if i didn't only because of the large amount of undeserved praise it's been receiving.

B000VE439Y|4.0|This is a good upgrade of the crappy old single-disc version of [[ASIN:6305388458 Life of Brian]].  The new transfer is excellent, and the special features are great.<br /><br />My only complaint is the lack of a DVD insert.  The Special Edition of Holy Grail (not sure about Meaning of Life, since I got it used so it may have been missing something) had a nice insert, but here we get nothing.  I wish more DVD releases paid attention to this area, since it means a lot to some of us.
B000UBMWG4|4.0|I will not write the synopsis of the movie \\"Blade Runner\\" as this 5 disk Blu Ray pack contains all 4 official versions of this cult Future Noir (film noir in SF setting). I will also not describe how impressive it is to see the 2007 version in 1080p High Definition and hear Vangelis in HD sound, all stored on Disk 1. It is interesting to know however that the other 3 versions are all on a single disk. Thus offering an additional 9 hours of extra's on the other 3 disks!  A must have set, certainly given the price!

B00008RWB3|5.0|A challenging and exhaustive book, but no less fun because of this. Foster Wallace is by the far the funniest and most imaginative writer in America today. Read Infinite Jest (push through the difficult times) if only to spend time inside his beautiful poetry of a brain.<br /><br />Ignore the literary critics and meta-reviews -- just indulge in this dystopian world of tennis, drugs, and television that shines the harsh light on how ridiculous we all are. Your brain will expand and your heart will open to the world -- it's that kind of a book.
B000VECAC6|5.0|I love that they included the read thru of the script with some story boards to boot. What a transfer!
B0001YRVN4|5.0|My old videotape copies of the first three star wars movies were becoming more than a bit worn, so I was very happy to finally learn that the movies had been released on DVD.  I am very happy with the results too.  The additional 'making of' DVD also has a lot of fascinating information about the creation of the Star Wars trilogy.
B000Q6ZG5C|3.0|... Nothing in this is different from the regular DVD. It looks much better though.

B000MQ54OY|2.0|But the goofy \\"Everyone hug a tree for Mother Gaia\\" ending spoils this silly trip.
0785814531|5.0|Despite all who have attempted the genre since, Poe remains the supreme master of the horrific short story. From this collection I select \\"Berenice\\" to comment on, not only because it is a classic example of Poe, but also because it deals with a subject so typically his, that of obsession.<br />There is little point in trying not to \\"spoil\\" a Poe story by avoiding telling the final outcome, for in this story, as in much of his work, the fascination lies not in a teasing or elaborate plot leading to a surprise revelation, but in morbid, gristly dwelling on the awful texture of misery, melancholia and near madness. One can read them repeatedly, and they still taste satisfyingly rank and vile.<br />In this short story of brooding obsession, Egaeus looses his wife, Berenice, to illness, and in a fit of abstraction and obsession opens her grave and rips out the part of her that his mind has fixated upon: her teeth. Nasty and simple, but unforgettable.<br />There is little joy in Poe's world. Love, hope and happiness are only shown as a prelude to loss, to provide a fading dusk against which the blackness of the tragic end stands out more clearly.<br />It's interesting that some of Poe's readers complained to the editor when Berenice was published in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1935. This was early in Poe's career, and he reports the subscription list of this periodical as 700. In December of that year he was made editor, and by the time he left the subscription list numbered 5,500. Obviously then, as now, there was quite an appetite for horror amongst readers.
B000ZK4466|5.0|As all their previous albums, at a glance, this one is not an easy listening. But if you just forget about following the lyrics and trying to find out where each song starts and finishes and instead close your eyes and let yourself been carried away... it is a great experience. This is Mars Volta's most coherent and richest albums musically, and at the same time, the more complex. Each time you listen to this album you'll find out an instrument or solo which you've never heard previously. Cedric's voice is hitting higher notes then ever! The more you listen to this album, the more you'll like it. The duo Omar Rodriguez Lopez/Cedric Bixler Zavala is among the most talented and prolific in progressive music history. The Mars Volta has been compared to lots of great bands from the seventies. They sound like all of them and at the same time, like none of them. Their sound is unique and fits their name.  About the album. Just Goliath itself is worth buying the album. And so are the rest of the 75 minutes of total aural assault!
B000088E6D|5.0|I love the songs on this CD.  Michael does an excellent job.  Would definitely recommend this CD as one of his best.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Melody has one of those voices that only shows up once in a generation. she has an amazing talent and she knows how to use her voice to compliment the music. it is the perfect combination of music and voice. what else can I say?...I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this CD.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Just incredible!    From the first track to the last one you can't miss one!  What a riot that Paramore caused in me! This is fabulous! This is CD is really addictive and i recomment it to all good rock fans!    Hayley's voice, Joshua's and Jeremy's guitars and Zac's drums perform together to make a unique sound! That's what i call music: Paramore!
B0000013GT|5.0|Outkast's second album is one of the greatest sophomore releases of all time.  Big Boi and Dre continue with what they left off in Southernplayalistic...  They have some of the best beats the South has ever produced and two of the best flows out there.  It truly is a combination that can't go wrong.  Idlewild and Speakerboxx/Love Below are decent albums, but do not judge Outkast until you listen to ATLiens and Aquemini.  Both are easily 10 out of 10 classics.
B000641ZA4|1.0|The DVD is absolutely great, but my DVD player would not play it because it is the wrong region - NOT REGION 1. I have to watch it in my computer without enjoying the surround sound!
B00104W8T6|5.0|this CD sounds great and all the songs are awesome and it even has the \\"anyone else but you\\" song that both actor and atress sing at the end of the movie. all songs are different from the normal rock or punk, its a calm and sing along kind. i like it and if you like the sound in the movie you will like it as well.
B00109T5WY|4.0|Well, I can't say that it was bad, but it didn't fill my expectations. I was expecting something better than Young Mountain, which I like a lot. I expected a more mature sound, but somehow it didn't fit in.
1845767055|5.0|This book is a terrific collection of Mr. Bonner's work.  I have seen a lot of these images on his website, but having them in this format really brings a new depth to my appreciation of his skill.  One thing that is wonderful about his work is all the details he packs into each illustration.  On the web, these details are harder to spot, but with this book I have really come to enjoy searching the backgrounds for all the small details and have been delighted with the discoveries.    The selection of illustrations was very thorough as well.  There are selections starting from his early work in art school and onwards up through his development as a professional illustrator.  The reading experience is also enhanced by the anecdotes the artist throws in about his memories, inspiration and experiences surrounding a particular piece.  It really personalizes the work in a way that doesn't come through in any other format.  I also really enjoyed seeing the sketchbook studies being  used as backgrounds for some of the text pages, it just rounds out an overall great book and I've read it through several times, finding something new and interesting with each reading.
B000002H97|5.0|Without a doubt the greatest album of all time, no matter what music type or time frame we're talkin about here.  It took some thought to come to this conclusion though.  The only album in my opinion to give The Black Album competition in this discussion is GNR's Appetite For Destruction, which still wasn't as influential or timeless as this flat-out masterpiece.  With the release of The Black Album, Metallica recreated music as we know it.  Their dominance is unmatched to this day...very few bands have ever even touched the level of mastery that the kings of rock/metal have CONSISTENTLY maintained for 25 years counting.  I'll repeat that...25 years at the top.  Unbelievable.  GNR had it for 5 years max.  Its difficult to grasp this feat considering the different eras of music Metallica has steam-rolled through.  Grunge?  Glam Rock?  Those are forgotten.  You get my point.  Bow down to the kings- there's no need for me to go through all the songs and explain their greatness.  You know them already.
B000ETQPYM|4.0|This book was written with such emotion it was hard to believe someone so young wrote it.  It's a simple story but full of feeling.  The characters are likable and despite the sadness, it's a book you won't want to put down.

B000UXKYWQ|1.0|The 2nd disk with the restored version in English has French subtitles that cannot be turned off.  The subtitles are in the picture and are extremely annoying.
B00009V7P8|3.0|This is a fairly uneven CD--some songs are very nice, but others make you want to reach for the \\"skip\\" button.
0321544080|5.0|Joe knows how to share his photographic experiences with both the amateur photographer and the seasoned pro.   His stories help explain the gear that made the shot but more importantly the humanity behind the lens that helps create great images with sometimes difficult subjects. There are photojournalism assignments and complex commercial projects. He is not afraid to admit failures with the successes. I found it entertaining and inspiring.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|It was a beautiful story and scenery.  If you love westerns, this is the one to purchase.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|It is beautiful.....something to watch a lot.  I like owning it.  Some scenes no-one has ever seen before.
B00130EVSS|5.0|Excellent movie.  I rented because of Viggio.  He is a great actor and the Russian Mafia-theme was very interesting to me.  I can see why he was nominated for an Oscar for his role - he was very believable and I especially loved the cigarette in the tongue scene - ouch!  It was everything I expected!  Two thumbs up!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I love all the songs on this cd. Def. a girl power type of cd. I love dancing to this! Highly recommended!
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Its a very cute movie, my children ages 4,7,9 loved this movie. We can't wait for it to come out on dvd, to purchase.
B000JLSLZG|5.0|On a degree of difficulty scale this is one of the toughest movies to attempt to make. Robin Hood is another. Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn pulled it off nicely in their adaptation back in the 70's. Excalibur is about a 9 and Robin Hood about an 8, with a 10 being the toughest. Green tights and shiny armor isn't always easy. The late Heath Ledger did a remarkable job in A Knight's Tale of capturing this ideal.    Anyway, enough background and context. Excalibur is a spectacle, yet personal and intimate. If you like a good sword fight there are many staggered neatly throughout for your enjoyment. From the Lady in the Lake to King Arthur it's all good. Lancelot is perfect. Merlin - perhaps one of the toughest roles within one of the toughest films - is integral to the movie's success. Merlin in many ways is the glue of this film. As a sidenote: Nicol Williamson who plays Merlin also played Little John in \\"Robin and Marion\\" the Robin Hood movie I spoke of earlier. Nigel Terry as Arthur is sublime. When he pulls the sword from the rock and the music bridge hits if the hair on your neck doesn't stand up ... hit eject. This movie isn't for you. Helen Mirren is downright HOT and CREEPY as Morgana. It's one of those roles where in one part of the movie you're rooting for her and by the end your cheering her demise. My favorite performance is actually one that doesn't last very long. There are many fine performances and considering Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson are minor supporting actors emphasizes that this movie provides a rare and powerful cast not seen in today's movies. My personal favorite performance is that of Uther, Arthur's father. Played by a young and rough Gabe Byrne this is a raw and syrupy interpretation. I give Boorman credit for keeping this in the film. This sets the table for how lust, sex, and power will be woven throughout the story. Byrne singlehandedly gets the audience primed for an incredible ride.    And hey - a happy ending? Who knew. The endalmost has a Godfather Part III feel to it. This is one of the most underrated movies of all time. I highly recommend it.
B000BCE918|4.0|I have an extensive DVD collection. The Jurassic Park Trilogy is not my absolute most favorite of this genre... but... it needed to be in the collection. So for those of you that want all three in a nice tight bundle, this is a good buy. If you are looking for the trilogy because you just LOVE Jurassic Park... you should probably spend a little more for a better package deal. The front of the box opens like two swinging doors... only these doors don't close and fasten in any way, which is the only thing I would change.
1416502653|3.0|This book is well written and very easy to get through. The central thesis of bringing focus to individual strengths, and thereby not focusing on weaknesses, is supported with information from Gallup surveys.    The web exercise that is required to identify your strengths is easy to use, but a little confusing as it appears that there is a later version of this book available and it is accompanied by some pricey consulting/coaching services.    I'd recommend this as an addition to the reading lists of any 20somethings who are entering the working world, or even if you are not.
B000TGCR3S|4.0|Though this was not the movie that i thought that it was going to be, i still loved watching it.  I was lost with some of the progress of the movie, and ending up thinking things were different than they turned out to be.  After watching it for a second time, i was able to understand where everyone was coming from and what was ment by comments made throughout the movie.  I would also compare this movie to something along the mindset of Ghost in the Shell, just add in some colouring book ha ha.
0143038419|5.0|Gilbert's adventures combine a challenging spiritual quest with dreamlike travel experiences. Her struggles with inner pain are real and gripping, while the exotic locales stoke the reader's appetite for more. She seems to mix it all very well -- inner growth, vocational renewal, and the best kinds of friendship. I just loved her Balinese friend Wayan.<br /><br />Some people would consider this book spiritual tourism at its most escapist. But let me give one paragraph as an example of what Gilbert puts herself through:<br /><br />\\"It took me a while to drop into real silence. Even after I'd stopped talking, I found I was still humming with language. My organs and muscles of speech -- brain, throat, chest, back of neck -- vibrated with the residual effects of talking long after I'd stopped making sounds. My head shimmered in a reverb of sound, the way an indoor swimming pool seems to echo interminably with sounds and shouts, even after the kindergarteners have gone home for the day. It took a surprisingly long time for all this pulsation of speech to fall away, for the whirling noises to settle. Maybe it took about three days.\\"<br /><br />I'm really glad to see this book topping the bestseller lists in North America, and I hope Gilbert's kind of adventure becomes the popular aspiration of the future.<br /><br />--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization
B0000TB01Y|2.0|I know, I know - the vast majorities of reviews gave this top marks, and I'm unlikely to change any minds.<br /><br />But I bought this soundtrack BEFORE seeing the show - my judgement wasn't affected by the spectacle of the show itself. [[ASIN:B0000TB01Y Wicked (2003 Original Broadway Cast)]]I had loved the book, and got tickets to see the show here in Tokyo. Knowing that most of the songs would be translated into Japanese, I thought I'd better listen to the soundtrack a few times before seeing it.<br /><br />As my title says, I felt like most of the big songs (Defying Gravity, for example) were just Christian rock ballads with Oz twists here and there. In \\"Wonderful,\\" they've managed to create a brand-new potboiler - completely stale, even on the first listening. \\"Noone Mourns the Wicked\\" is one of those Lloyd Webber things where everyone is screaming at the top of their lungs. The absolute worst, however, is \\"Emerald City.\\" The rhythms, forgettable lyrics, and especially the cheesy synthesizer - it sounds like an ad for a local amusement park.<br /><br />Having said that, I thought there were some nice moments - particularly \\"Popular.\\" And \\"Loathing\\" is even better - why does nobody see that it's a perfect lampoon of the rest of the show's music?
B0011FXLCC|4.0|I had gotten in to Goldfrapp with the Black Cherry CD.  Once I had heard that I went back and got Felt Mountain.  Black Cherry for me at the time was perfect as I was constantly looking for new electronic music and it was one of the first electronic albums I had gotten and had fallen in love with every song.  So when I went backwards and got Felt Mountain, I liked it but it was a much slower listen but it still had it's own strengths.  I also loved Supernature and thought it was great from beginning to end but it was very commercial and seeing it used to Revlon, Target and Nip/Tuck commercials made Goldfrapp feel a little less special.  Not that i have a problem with them making money with their music, but it felt well, less special.    I couldn't wait for Seventh Tree to come out and I was also excited that it was going to be more \\"organic\\".  I like the fact that they did a 180 and came out with something so different than Supernature.  This will definitely alienate those who got into them with Supernature, but it makes it special again.  The best songs are Clowns, Road to Somewhere and A&E.  The whole album is great though and I think once the initial shock is over in how different it is, it will latch on to you in the same way Black Cherry and Supernature did.  I had to drive to Pennsylvania for my job and I listened to it over and over on the way there and back and I was addicted. It has that quality about it.  That's what makes Goldfrapp so great.
0141024038|5.0|A friend of mine knew that I was working my way through the classics that I didn't read in school, and got me a copy of P&P for Christmas.  Personnally I think this is one of the best works Jane Austen came out with!  It took a couple of pages for me to adjust to the antique english, but once I did, I loved immersing myself in a culture long gone.  Once or twice I even caused my husband's brows to raise when I accidentally answered him in Olde English!<br /><br />  Austen gives just enough detail (thankfully not enough to bore you), allows her main characters to be fallible, and whisks you off into a tale that is wonderfully wrapped up at the very end.  None of that here's-the-last-page-sorry-you-still-have-questions nonsense (fine for a series, but definately not a stand-alone)!<br /><br />  If you too are looking for an extremely well-written, entertaining classic with a happy ending, don't let all the collegiate level stuff scare you!  Give yourself a chance to get used to the old phrases, and give P&P a chance!<br /><br />A.L. Travis<br />Author of The Pillar of Light: The Legends of Milana Series<br />[..]
0670034711|1.0|It took me nearly a year to finish this book.  I was so disgusted by the writer's apparent lack of awareness of her own privilege, her trite observations, and the unbelievably shallow way in which she represents a journey initiated by grief, that I couldn't bear to read beyond Italy.  Like others who have written here, I made myself pick the book up again because so many people have raved about it, and I made myself finish it, hoping all the while there would be some redemptive insight or at least some small kernel of originality or wisdom.  I was sorely disappointed.  Liz is so obsessed with male attention throughout the book (in every section, she expounds in great detail on her flirtations with men, many of whom seem to \\"take care of her\\" or compliment her on her wit, beauty, or charm), that it makes her self-described quest to learn to be alone seem absurd and farcical. She does not have a feminist bone in her body; shocking for a woman who is purportedly on a quest for self-discovery after what she describes as a \\"devastaing divorce.\\" She seems to have absolutely no capacity for self-awareness or reflection in this regard, and her superficial treatment of this and other aspects of her psyche bored me to tears.      Additionally, her brand of spirituality certainly does not come close to transcending the fashionable Western obsession with all things Eastern, particularly Buddhism and the ashram culture.  That a Westerner could go to India on her spiritual quest and have absolutely no awareness of 1) her gross appropriation of another culture's religion, and 2) the abject poverty that surrounds her, is inexusable.  She oozes privilege at every turn, and that privilege remains unacknowledged and unexamined.      This woman had nothing to teach me; I am sorry I spent the time and energy trying to finish the book.  I am sickened that Paramount has bought the rights to the book for a motion picture, and that she stands to make even more money than she already has onthis insipid and ignorant story.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I was so happy to hear this was released on DVD. It's really sad that such a great series was cancelled after only 19 episodes. Watching the show just makes me shake my head at whoever made the decision to kill it off. I don't think there will ever be a show quite like it. For those who are new to it, here's a quick summary. Angela Chase, played by Claire Danes is the lead character. She is a sophomore in high school and is still trying to find herself. She is a multi-faceted character whose quest for happiness and love often alienates herself and those around her, mostly her parents, neighbor/schoolmate Brian and her former best friend Sharon. Her new best friend, Rayanne seems to be the opposite of Sharon at first, but the two are not as different as they seem as the short series goes on. Rayanne is the crazy, \\"wild\\" girl we all knew in high school and her behavior is as humorous as it is watching a train wreck. Still, Rayanne is engaging and a lovable girl under her tough girl demeanor. Much of the show revolves around her drinking problem and her friendships with Angela and their gay friend Ricky who frequents the girl's restroom along with his gal pals. You'll see a lot of the girl's restroom on the show. Ricky is another amazing character whose sexuality and abusive home life comes more into focus in the last few episodes. Brain is another character who comes more into focus later on; he's even given a whole episode where he does the voice over instead of Angela in \\"Life of Brian\\". Then there is Jordan Catalano. He is the dreamy rebel-under acheiver we knew in school. Angela falls hard for him and it is often frustrating how the two go back and forth without going anywhere. Jordan, at first acts distant, unavailable and constantly hurts Angela's feelings. Just when you think they are going to get together, bam another hurdle. Toward the end, Angela begins to think she is finally over Jordan, but unexpected events may change that. The focus isn't always on theteens. The parents, Patty and Graham and the adults in their lives also have stories of their own and in the short time we know them we learn a lot about them. Angela has friction with both of them, Patty spars with Rayanne's mother and Patty and Graham have conflict about work-related issues and a couple of women in Graham's life that could threaten the Chase's marriage. Patty also struggles with Angela's choice of friends but that takes a different turn in my favorite episode \\"So Called Angels\\". In this episode, Ricky finds himself homeless and Patty has a problem with taking in the gay teen until she learns a valuable lesson at Christmas. Angela's sister Danielle is not as ignored as you might think. A memorable scene is where Danielle dresses as Angela for Halloween and even mocks her teen angst. The series came out during the generation x period while it's grungy mid '90s look might keep new teen viewers at bay, it's stories and characters are compelling enough to draw them in. I think it's absolutely perfect and watching the DVD set brings back great memories. I love the music and the whole pop culture scene of the time and it's an excellent piece of TV history. The price seems pretty steep for 19 episodes but the packaging is excellent. There are 5 discs with episodes and the 6th disc has great bonus features that a show like this deserves to have. It's well worth it. It doesn't even feel scripted! It's a truly life changing experience watching this series. I envy anyone who has yet to see it. You're in for a treat. If only we knew then there would be nothing but \\"reality\\" and game shows on TV now. To me, this is true reality television. Thanks for giving us this wonderful gift!
B00005JPUN|3.0|I remember being excited about this movie when I first saw the trailer, but after watching I think the trailer was better, at least it was short and showed all the interesting parts. This was not a terrible movie, it was watchable but it felt bland and there were really no surprises, half of it was chase scenes, I felt as if I was watching a remake of \\"The Fugitive\\" or something, and not to mention Nicole Kidman's frozen face - I think some emotion and wrinkles on her would make her look human, instead she looked more alien than half the invaded bodies. I never saw the original but half way thought the film I asked myself - what is this movie about? It didn't feel that it was about anything; sadly it was people going though actions with no juice and energy behind any of it.    This is something that I can see myself watching once but never again, the character development was completely non existent, even Daniel Craig was lacking, he looked washed out and bored to be there, there was no passion about anything whatsoever.  I also felt disappointed by the ending, it disintegrated any hopes of this movie packing a punch, at least if it was horrible and gruesome and wild I would have felt that I watched something, instead it felt like a lukewarm leftover lunch that I ate only because I didn't want to throw it away.      - Kasia S.

0452289963|1.0|When it comes to reading, the American public appears to be as helpless/hopeless/naive as vis-a-vis the goings on in politics. This is born out both by the millions of copies gobbled up following our female Messiah's (Oprah) endorsement, as well as the flocking to the new male Messiah (Obama). It's time to change the Gershwin lyrics to: \\"Oprah, Obama - let's call the whole thing off\\".
B000N6TYLW|5.0|[[ASIN:B000N6TYLW Gilmore Girls - The Complete Seventh Season]]  I Love the Gilmore Girls and was very upset with Lorelai sleeping with Chris at the end of season 6. But loved the outcome of Season Seven and what a way to end a great series. The last scene in Lukes diner was very appropriate. But I felt a little cheated that we never saw Lorelai actually marry someone and I thought her character deserved a wedding as well as her fans. We had been waiting years for the Luke/Lorelai thing to happen and then the writers cheated the fans. But I was glad that at the end Lorelai was happy. Maybe they could make a movie in a couple of years. It seems to be a trend. But if love the Gilmore Girls as I do you wont be disappointed with season seven. I have watched the entire series twice since receiving season seven and on quite a few occasions have picked a couple of episodes to watch over and over. Lorelai singing was a real treat, the Gilmore Grandparents got into singing mode as well and did a great job. I think I might watch the last 2 episodes of the Girls again right now. I'm sorry the season is over as well as sorry the Gilmore Girls have gone but I'm SO glad I have all the seasons to watch. Thanks to Amazon I was able to watch the seventh season before it was available in Australia. I don't think they have aired it on TV here yet. PITY!!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Some have said North and South is like Pride and Prejudice, only darker.  Truer words could not BE said, but also...  Don't be afraid of the dark. ;-)  It's a beautiful film, and the romance is so meaningful.  I highly recommend North and South.
B00005R5G9|5.0|I watched this just about every time it came on TV and finally decided to buy it.  It is one of those movies you keep coming back to.  Light and funny comedy and he ended up with the RIGHT person (not Roxy as someone thought).  This is Kim Cattrell's first image as a \\"future\\" Sex in the City lady!!!
B000002BPS|5.0|The only thing to say about this album is that you have to listen to it to judge it. It is honest rock and straightforward in what it wants to be, just fun music to listen to. No pretense to be political correct and nowhere complicated musical compositions, but somehow you can hear the boys enjoying themselves. So should we, life is not so complicated after all.
B0012QE4QC|3.0|This piece of pulp fiction is a mixed bag. It seems to be made for those who like history and love a racy tale, but don't want to see any nudity and don't mind a screenplay that doesn't know where it's going and is in no hurry to get there. Cursed with a story that too often sinks into being just another generic melodrama, the movie has Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson all dressed up with no place, at least on screen, to get naked. Worse, it's not even good eye candy. Though the costumes are lavish (especially on Portman), the film displays them, as well as everything else, in a color palette that's as drab as its story.<br /><br />When I read [[ASIN:1416560602 the book]] I was a little bothered by its repetitive story and inaccurate history. The movie is worse on both counts, and in the process also cuts the novel's intriguing glimpse into what life was like back in the 1500s. Its many slow-moving scenes give the gals plenty of chances to comb the lice from their hair, but, unlike in the novel, never once do they do it. The book also certainly didn't pretend that women were anything more than what they were back then -- unimportant and often humiliated, used as pawns by the men of the family. In the movie, however, Anne and Mary's mother makes more than one speech with a modern, feminist take.<br /><br />Despite all that, I must say that Portman impressed me. She knows how to play someone with a nervous, desperate obsession. Good ol' Queen Amidala is really the only reason I gave this even three stars.
075640407X|5.0|I enjoyed this very much. Rothfuss isn't as heavy-handed with his fantasy world, telling me more about his main character, Kvothe. He's a clever young man, orphaned and alone, who makes his way through life. Some of his adventures are because he's still young and naive, and some are because of his world. This was wonderfully written and I'd recommend it to everyone. It's a great read for any age.
B000X1R4S2|5.0|Besides the Shining which still makes me jumpy no matter how many times I read it or watch the movie, IT is his ultimate best novel.  It scares me out of my wits everytime I read it.

0385338724|5.0|I am a huge Sophie Kinsella fan. One of my favorite all time chick lit books is \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" and I've read it more than once - it is laugh-out-loud funny and lovable. I also love the Shopaholic books, some more than others.    That all being said, I would have to say that Remember Me? is now in my top 3 of Kinsella's books. I read it in one night and couldn't put it down. Yes, it is a light read as others said, but that isn't a bad thing at all! All of Kinsella's books are \\"light\\" reads! I like to be entertained by my books, that's why I read chick lit, and this book was extremely entertaining - funny, witty, but also extremely endearing - it wasn't all \\"fluff\\", there are some serious parts too. I truly liked Lexi, the main character. I wish this book, along with \\"Secret\\", could be made into a movie. It has all the makings of a great romantic comedy in written form.    I laughed out loud at many parts, and also re-read certain scenes over because I just like the way Kinsella writes - her words make me \\"feel\\" the characters' emotions.    It is one of those books that I wish I could read for the first time again. If you are a Kinsella fan, or a chick lit fan in general, read it...you won't be disappointed.
B000TFINY6|5.0|This review is not for the Season itselft (which is awesome) but for the Blu-ray watching experience.  At the beginning of the discs there is an introduction by the creators and they explain this is how Lost is meant to be watched,  and they are TOTALLY CORRECT!!!!  The picture and sound is amazing and soo clear.  Probably because they actually film the show in HD, but it actually looks better than the original HD broadcasts because it is in 1080p!  Something that you can never say about the DVD versions of TV shows.  More shows should be on Blu-ray!!!!!!
630469654X|2.0|This movie has excellent acting and a great plot. It also has the absolute worst score I've ever heard, by far. I tried to ignore it, but it would not be ignored. The Alan Parsons soundtrack completely ruined the movie.

B000MP0XIW|1.0|I will wait until they release it for viewing on AMERICAN machines, before I go digging around for any \\"special unlock codes\\" to watch this show. How incredibly lame that the release to other countries would take priority over the country this show was made in.  Rediculous.    I was initially excited to see this show available, I absolutely LOVED this as a kid...but then...depression. :(   If this is never released in USA format, I will never buy.  What would have been an easy 5-star rating, gets one measly star soley based on this reason.

B000WMFZMY|5.0|This is an excellent DVD Collection of a very overlooked action movie from the 60's road-show era. The extras are detailed and well-done especially the documentary regarding the producer Samuel Bronston who was a great showman in his time. Sophia Loren never looked better and the sets and cinematography are first-rate and the musical score is pure-Nirvana from Mr. Rozsa. Thank god for letter-boxing!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am more than pleased with North & South! The acting is superb, especially that of Richard Armitage. His accent is difficult to understand at first, but as the movie progresses you become used to it. The costumes and setting are perfect for this wonderful story by Elizabeth Gaskell. I can't wait to watch it again!
0805079831|5.0|For decades, we've been baraged with the idea that the free market is a force of nature, as incontestable as the law of gravity, and that it somehow represents the natural extension of free democratic societies.  We've heard this so often, we've all but ceased to question it, yet the history of unfettered free market policies fails to support empirically their proponents' idealized predictions.  This is the blindfold that Naomi Klein's work seeks to lift from our eyes.<br /><br />Ms. Klein chronicles the repeated efforts of free market advocates to impose radical free market policies around the world and observes that, in stark contrast to the joyous choruses of freedom on the march offered by the architects of such policies, the reality has been far less promising.  In every instance, \\"free\\" market policies have been forced upon populations which did not desire them, and with the uniform and predictable consequence of making a tiny minority richer than kings, at the expense of impoverishing the majority of the population.<br /><br />Critics fault the quality of Ms. Klein's economic analysis, which I find telling.  Ms. Klein is not an economist, nor does she pretend to be.  Rather, she is a journalist who is chronicling events, none of which, interesting enough, do her critics wish to discuss.<br /><br />I also am not an economist and I do not presume to speculate whether Milton Friedman and his disciples are as sinister as Ms. Klein perhaps overreachingly suggests, but it matters not at all to me what their intentions may or may not have been: what does matter is that their experiments in radical free markets have consistently produced catastrophic human costs.  It is therefore far from having reached the level of an established truism that the \\"free market\\" represents some benevolent force of nature and thus the only sensible goal of every policy maker.  Quite the opposite: the costly and bloody track record of such policies demands a serious evaluation of the theory's basic assumptions.<br /><br />Yet, as Ms. Klein points out, proponents of radical free market economics share with other fundamentalists a faith in their ideology which denies any admission of error.  Like religious fundamentalists, they have created a logical closed loop, whereby any evidence conflicting with their world view, no matter how overwhelming, is invariably dismissed as the fault of external influences and tamperings with the idealized workings of the free market as they understand it.  I find it ironic that these economists like to think of themselves as scientists describing a natural phenomenon, yet the first rule of the scientist is to find hypotheses to explain what they empirically observe; the first rule of the free market economists seems to be to assert a weak hypothesis, and then attempt to force reality to conform to it, no matter how poor a fit it may be.<br /><br />That Dr. Friedman and his followers are unable or unwilling to acknowledge the reality of their misguided hypotheses is regretable.  If we are to have any hope of avoiding repetitions of the same tragic mistakes and failures to which their flawed ideas have led us, it is crucial that the rest of us at least begin to look rather more critically at the fruit those policies have in fact born.  Ms. Klein's work is an important step in that direction.Yet, as Ms. Klein points out, proponents of radical free market economics share with other fundamentalists a faith in their ideology which denies any admission of error.

It seems as if Erykah is not satisfied with the movement she started with Baduizm and is somehow trying to reinvent herself to a specific genre which try as I might I cant name.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This is one of Miyazaki's best movies.  It has a strong environmental theme but that is one of the aspects that makes his movies great, the built in morality lesson that accompanies a great, entertaining story line.  The movie is voiced by several well known actors such as Mark Hamill, Edward James Olmos, and Patrick Stewart.  The bonus features in which these stars are interviewed is also interesting, and this is coming from someone who usually doesn't care for the extras.  All in all a great movie and a great buy.

0316001821|2.0|Sometimes, it's very easy to understand why a book gains notariety and stays on the bestseller lists ad nauseum, such as the case with The Kite Runner. However, after reading The Lovely Bones, I wrinkled my nose and shook my head - I honestly couldn't see what the fuss was about.     The story is told by the ghost of Susie Salmon, who has been recently murdered by Ye Olde Neighborhood Pedophile. The reader is then taken on Susie's sappy, sloppy journey of peeking in on her family and friends, watch how they cope (or don't) with her death, and ultimately, witnessing the downfall of her killer, from Heaven, which is so ill-defined as to be irritating in its vagueness.     Granted, though the very premise of the story should have tipped me off that this was going to necessarily be a saccharine tear-jerker, I was plodding through this forgettable bit of \\"chick lit\\" (what a shame that young women writers and readers think so little of themselves to label lukewarm fare such as this appealing writing to their demographic)and probably would have finished it and immediately cleared it from my mind, but for the unforgiveably ridiculous ending.     I won't give it completely away, but think of a hybrid between a \\"Sweet Valley Twins\\" novel and the ending of the movie \\"Ghost\\" and you're pretty much on point.
B000002KXO|5.0|It's been a long time since I listened to music from an audio CD. It's always mp3-this, mp3-that. This audio CD is like a breeze of fresh cool air. If I can give more than 5 stars I would.    Here's how I came to know about this album, Mirage. Back in 1986 (how long ago was that?) I recorded on tape a music I heard on the radio. I loved it. But I didnt know the title nor the artist. All I remembered were the words, wish you were here and the fine melody. Soon after I lost that tape and never seem to hear the song played on the radio again. But I never forgot how beautiful and relaxing it was even with my crappy recording.    Fast forward to 2008, I decided to seriously look for it using the magic of Google. I searched for \\"wish you were here.\\"  Google returned mostly with a rock band Pink Floyd. I knew it wasnt the one. Finally I got a link to a band called Fleetwood Mac and with the aid of Amazon preview I confirmed that my song was in their album, Mirage! Wish You Were Here is still so beautiful! It is as captivating today as it was before. The other songs are all very good too!    I don't know much about Fleetwood Mac, but if this album is any indication, I think they are a talented gifted band. Their music is clean and neat sounding. Disciplined even. I highly recommend Mirage!

0596101996|5.0|This book is a fantastic reference. So many technical books typically live short lives, we use them once on a single project and never touch them again, however David Flanagan's JavaScript: The Definitive Guide has clear value and longevity.<br /><br />This book provides 350+ pages of reference material for the Core JavaScript Language and Client-side JavaScript (the online Mozilla Developer Center is one of the few references that comes close to this level of comprehensive reference).

B00008976Y|5.0|\\"Blue\\" is not an easy film to watch but for that reason it makes it that more indispensible.  The film deals with a young widow coping with not only the loss of her husband but her child as well.  The film essentially examines how we comport ourselves in the face of great personal tragedy.  We don't necessarily agree with the choices that Julie(Juliette Binoche) makes but they're certainly understandable.  There is no handbook for grief and some of us try to insulate ourselves from the past just to survive day to day.  Personally, I can relate to Julie because I have a sister who lost a husband at a young age and at the time I found some of her behavior inexplicable.  Binoche gives a carefully modulated performance that doesn't overplay the film's more dramatic elements.  A challenging film for adventurous filmgoers.
B00104W8T6|4.0|I hear that `Juno' is a pretty good movie. Actually, word on the street is that it's a great movie, but I couldn't tell you, because I haven't seen it yet. One of the saddest parts of trying to maintain a life while covering so many aspects of musical culture is that you don't get to see a lot of movies. My view of culture is totally lopsided, because I hear about 50 different CD's in a month, but I'm lucky if I can see even one movie in the same timeframe. Lucky for me, you don't have to see `Juno' to appreciate the soundtrack (although I'm sure that everyone who has will say that it most certainly helps). Most soundtracks are a mishmash of unrelated tracks thrown together into one collection because each suits a particular scene in the movie, but they have no common thread. `Juno' is different. Each song on this soundtrack blends with the others in a nearly seamless manner that reflects on and compliments those around it. The artists are diverse, including Belle and Sebastian, Sonic Youth, the Velvet Underground, Buddy Holly and Cat Power. These artists have little in common, but as heard here, there is a commonality that defines a mood and a theme (that obviously must represent that of the movie, which as I said, I did not yet see...)<br /> Kimya Dawson (the female half of Moldy Peaches) provides the glue that stitches all these disparate artists together. Her songs convey an appealing naivet&eacute; and a fey charm that somehow spreads into the entire soundtrack. She contributes a half-dozen songs here, and the result is a bit disarming.  Few bands could be more different than Sonic Youth and Belle and Sebastian, but as heard here, a casual listener could be forgiven for thinking that one artist performs the entire soundtrack. As Listen, I almost feel as if I'm watching the movie (that I never saw...). Maybe one day I'll rectify my lapse in judgment and see the film when it gets released on DVD. Meanwhile, I can imagine how good it is by playing the remarkably homogenous soundtrack.  B+ Tom Ryansoundtrack.  B+ Tom Ryan
0375424474|4.0|I mostly enjoyed reading this book.  It gives you a flavor for what it takes to be a paleontologist from a person with a lot of experience.  it also approaches adult bodies from developmental perspective - showing you the relationships that exist among different species.  It tells you how evolution tinkered with what is fundamentally the same way of doing things.    I do find that the author sometimes misleads the audiences by calling animals primitive - simply because they have a particular feature that retained its more primitive way of being.  All animals alive today are modern animals.  We didn't evolve from them or their relatives.  We share a common ancestor - which is very very different.    Sometimes the author juxtaposes pictures that lead you to mistakenly believe that all these animals are in the same liniage (Look at page 26 for an example of what I mean).  It is highly unlikely that they are.  I am sure that the author knows that.  I wish he made that more clear somehow.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|I am a huge SciFi fan, but there has always been a soft spot in me for the harder (ie. realistic) titles over the years. Gattaca is one of the finest films to come out of the 90's and one of the best SciFi films of all time. I still remember going to see it in the theater, where the film broke and they gave us free passes to 'Air Force One' (shudder). Over the years I have owned it on laser disc and Superbit DVD - this film is going to be amazing on blu-ray.    The film centers around Ethan Hawke, who plays a young man with a genetic defect who uses the identity of a recently paralyzed, genetically pure athlete (Jude Law) to pursue his dreams of going into space. The problem is society has basically bio-engineered the populace at conception (Hawke's character was made 'the old-fashioned way' in the back of his parents car) removing unwanted genetic problems to the point of discrimination against individuals who have not had their genetic structure perfected. When an important executive of the NASA-esque company where Hawke works is murdered, he becomes the prime suspect when an eyelash of his is identifed during the police investigation.    I don't want to explain the entire plot, with its twists and turns, only to say it is exciting up to the very end. Uma Thurman and Alan Arkin also give excellent performances as Hawke's love interest and a police detective respectively. An effective soundtrack and gorgeous cinematography will make this a must have for blu-ray fans. There are just some movies which I will re-buy, and this is one of them.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|The remastered version sounds much better than the previous issue of this, I heard new chords & sounds in the mix I'd never noticed before. The second CD is OK, the DVD of the Paris concert is not by today's standards but is OK as a historical piece.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|. . .Where is the Blu-Ray release?  Stuff like this should at least be released on both.  I can understand old episides, stuff that has already been released, but something completely new to video and no blue-ray rekease.  It's just not right.

B0012QE4QC|2.0|Despicable people doing contemptible things have never equaled solid entertainment. The Other Boleyn Girl is not without its highlights - those being negligible and spread out amongst poorly-paced, drawn-out bits of heavily censored romance. Natalie Portman delivers a worthwhile performance as the ill-fated Anne Boleyn, but the rest of the too-beautiful cast doesn't ever seem to authentically fit in to their lavish period piece costumes. Undoubtedly after viewing The Other Boleyn Girl, the audience will probably only want to research what truly happened.<br /><br />When the Queen of England, Katherine of Eragon (Ana Torrent) is unable to produce a male heir for impatient King Henry Tudor (Eric Bana), he becomes besotted by Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman), who is intentionally placed before him to allow her weak father Thomas and her conniving uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, to remain in good favor with royalty.<br /><br />During the King's visit, Anne's competitive personality finds Henry becoming injured, and being taken care of by her sister, Mary Boleyn (Scarlett Johansson). The greedy King soon falls for the dewy-eyed sister, and she is whisked back to the court for his pleasure. Not long after, Mary is pregnant, and Anne Boleyn secretly gets married to nobleman Henry Percy. Anne is banished when the Duke of Norfolk discovers her spontaneous and unplanned marriage, but within a mere two months is brought back to keep the King occupied while Mary is bedridden.<br /><br />Anne soon finds herself infatuated with potential power and control over the King, and manages to have Mary sent back to the countryside and Katherine of Aragon banished for false infidelities. Henry eventually breaks away from the Catholic Church when he arranges an annulment with his wife and marries Anne. Despite her promises, she is unable to produce a male heir for Henry, and he begins to regret his decisions over Katherine and his country, which leads to...well, the rest as they say, is history.<br /><br />The Other Boleyn Girl is not entirely a history lesson, but it certainly is about as much fun. Which is to say that the beginning plods along with ruthless details on trivial things, and the love triangle that forms is predictable and blas&eacute;. Perhaps the most unappealing factor with this film is its dislikeable characters. Mary is initially at fault for dispensing misery to her sister, causing her to be banished; after this, she never really feels like a leading force of good, but is sadly the only character the film steers the audience into rooting for. After Anne becomes jealous of her sister's success with the King, she is immediately an antagonist, wheeling and dealing to increase her power and remove her competition. The King himself is portrayed as an uncontrollably lustful and self-absorbed despot who thinks of himself before his kingdom, and presiding over all of these miserly characters is the Duke of Norfolk, who pulls the strings of his brother Thomas and plays with the lives and romances of Anne and Mary.<br /><br />With the leads dressed in luxuriant costumes (Portman looks like Queen Amidala from Star Wars) and being traded like cattle, The Other Boleyn Girl goes to great lengths to show off beautiful people frolicking about in medieval fetes. Outside of Portman, who does a sensational job in a poorly penned role, the remaining cast feels horribly misplaced, like wolves in sheep's clothing. By the conclusion, which perhaps unintentionally perfectly sets up for the film Elizabeth, all we really want to do is read about actual facts, and clear our minds of this heavily flourished film.<br /><br />- Mike Massieirl is not entirely a history lesson, but it certainly is about as much fun.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|\\"Amazing Grace\\" cannot be fully appreciated with only one viewing!  As other reviewers have noted there is some difficulty in following the flashback format of the movie so it takes some of us at least two viewings (subtitles help) to get all the details of the plot. The beauty of the production is that it's worth the time and effort.  The focus of the film is William Wilberforce, a hero who deserves far more recognition than he receives.  It takes a tremendous amount of courage to fight a well-established, profitable evil like the slave trade year after year,facing pressure from every political faction.  Wilberforce's views were too radical for the mainstream politicians of his day but not radical enough for the extremists (does this sound familiar to anyone else?).  The script presents an honest discussion of what the pros and cons of the whole issue were in eighteenth-century England. But all of the discussion would only interest academics--what makes the movie memorable is Ioan Gruffudd's performance.  Certainly, the supporting cast gave outstanding performances as well, but Gruffudd's is the brightest of them all. After you're familiar with the story, sit back and watch his portrayal. Gruffudd's personal charm, handsomeness, and general \\"likeableness\\" are key to the scenes of Wilberforce's beginning career. But he takes his character in to far deeper significance as he battles his demons in mid-career. His struggle affects his family and friends, and their support gives him the impetus to \\"try again.\\"     The director is to be commended for presenting Wilberforce's eccentricities with low-key humor, and his dependence on laudanum with sympathy. (The medical profession of his day administered the opiate-derivative as casually as aspirin is administered in our culture--no wonder he was addicted!) Where he failed Wilberforce somewhat is in not showing us the depths of his faith.  His beliefs are acknowledged as his motivation, but our self-labeled agnostic director did not understand that Wilberforce's faith was also his greatest strength.  With that caveat entered, I thoroughly appreciated the fine efforts that brought us \\"Amazing Grace.\\" The attention to historical detail and the on-location shoots round out the believability of the whole project. Hurrah to all involved! \\"Amazing Grace\\" has become one of my all-time favorites!
B00005JPOO|2.0|A rather childish blend of comedy, romance and the unearthing of morals and prejudices, Penelope tells the story of a horribly disfigured woman searching for a mythical cure to a monstrous curse. Essentially a reversed Beauty and the Beast, the film manages to be delightful occasionally, but as revolting as a pig-faced child during much of the character development and progression of romance.<br /><br />When a misguided Wilhern blueblood falls in love with a common woman and then backs out of a marriage to save his noble name, the distraught girl commits suicide. Her furious mother (who is conveniently a witch) places a curse on the first baby girl to be born into the bloodline. After generations of nothing but male heirs to the sizeable estate, Penelope (Christina Ricci) is finally born, a girl with the cursed ears and nose of a pig. Penelope is locked away and raised alone - her parents constantly worried about how the cruel outside world might react to her abnormalities. While some believe in the legend and others do not, Penelope's only hope of undoing her hideous bovine appendages is to find a fellow blueblood that will love and accept her as she is.<br /><br />As she learns to live with constant rejection, her parents struggle to keep her away from the media and from other people, first by faking her death, and then by holing her away in their luxurious mansion. To preserve the wealth in the family, her parents attempt to marry her off with a huge dowry, but suitor after suitor runs away in terror. One-eyed photographer Lemon (Peter Dinklage) uses sniveling blueblood Edward Vanderman (Simon Woods) and down-on-his-luck gambler Max Campion (James McAvoy) to get a picture of the pig-girl for use in his newspaper. When Penelope runs away, Max finds himself falling for her when no one else can bear to look in her direction.<br /><br />Is this film really about looking beyond the physical features of a person to discover their inner beauty? Or is it that rich people suck? Whatever the case may be, it's difficult to believe the message about inner beauty when Christina Ricci is gorgeous even with the pig makeup. The themes of the film are often lost amongst the bits of comedy that rarely evoke laughter and the shallow character development that causes these paper-thin personas to lose steam almost immediately. The blossoming romance between Max and Penelope is amateurishly insincere and the dialogue that accompanies their flirtations is largely farfetched. Regardless of the message, the execution in storytelling is notably disorderly. Right from the get-go Penelope feels like a live-action recreation of a motif from Shrek, in which the comical green man decides Fiona is perfect as an ogre.<br /><br />The large amount of cameos in Penelope almost make this film worth watching, although some of them are just obscure enough that they might not fall into the category of a cameo. Nick Frost from \\"Hot Fuzz\\" and \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" shows up, as does Lenny Henry, from the 1990's BBC show \\"Chef!\\". Supporting roles consist of Richard E. Grant from \\"Withnail and I\\" fame as Penelope's father, and Catherine O'Hara (For Your Consideration) as her mother. Simon Woods does an excellent job as the whiny aristocrat who will do anything to preserve his high-class name, and Ricci is unquestionably pleasant to watch.<br /><br />Sadly, Penelope works better as a thought-provoking concept than a feature length movie, and the interesting idea is quickly buried amongst the painfully mediocre dialogue and commonplace plot points.<br /><br />- Mike Massiease may be, it's difficult to believe the message about inner beauty when Christina Ricci is gorgeous even with the pig makeup.

0312263511|5.0|Some people may be disappointed by this book. There's very little about Commander Cernan's time on the surface of the moon. If that's all you want to know about, I'd still recommend the book but you'll only want to read a couple of chapters. But to buy the book for that reason would be to miss the point. This is the story of the man that was last to stand on the moon. The moon was his home for 3 days. For a guy over 70 years old, that's not a large period of his life, even if it is what history will remember him for. This is what it was like to be an astronaut for NASA at that time and that's all you need to know, and it's personal, heart warming, fun, exciting, distressing, stressful and sad, just like real life.   In 2007 I got the opportunity to meet Gene Cernan and had the pleasure of sharing dinner with him. He told me this book was the best way to know what it was like to be on the moon.  And he's right, in every way. It describes many years of hard work, dedication, hardship and sacrifice, for a short period of time in which he was kept so busy he had to treasure the moments where he could take it all in.  It is a testament to the quality of writing that my opinions of Commander Cernan are the same now, after reading the book as they were when I bade him farewell. He's a genuine, pull no punches guy. I don't think his heart is on his sleeve but he'll say what he thinks.  I was honoured to spend a time in company with Commander Gene Cernan and get to know him. Reading this book, you will get to know him too.   Read this book. It describes the pinnacle of human achievement and how it was done. The men, the women, the engineers, the scientists, the emotion, the humanity. It's all here and it makes you proud to be part of humanity because we may not be perfect, but neither were they.    It's magnificent!
0743298039|5.0|This book was just lovely.  The story was intriguing and written with beautiful, descriptive language.
1416905014|5.0|There are no words to describe how beautiful and awesome this book is.  I was bitten by the pop-up bug when I purchased Robert Sabuda's Alice in Wonderland (Matthew's mentor).  This book is equally as beautiful and I love that it is not a \\"Disney\\" princess book.  The center page has Cinderella after her transformation in full ballroom attire with real ribbon and she stands about 5 or so inches tall out of the middle of the page.  In the final pages you can actually watch the prince's hand place the glass slipper on her foot and pull a tab to watch them ride off in to the sunset.  This is an amazing book and anyone the least bit interested in this book should not hesitate to puchase it. I guarantee you'll want to collect all of their books after seeing this work of art!
6305907145|4.0|I saw the movie first, and recommended it to a friend who was soon shreiking with laughter at the deviations from the book -- Fanny capering across the yard, chasing Edward with a riding crop, her aunt, whacked out on morphine, etc...<br /><br />I read the book, enjoyed it, and then came back to the movie.<br /><br />There are a lot of adaptations whose main purpose is to put as much of the book on screen as possible, keeping everything in the same order, and being fiercely loyal to the author's vision. This is just one person's opinion, but I think that's the wrong way to go. When I want pure Jane Austen, I read.<br /><br />I think that if a filmmaker goes to the time and effort to make a movie from a favorite book, they have the right to interpret and get creative. (If you disagree, you should probably just stay away from this movie.)<br /><br />I thought that infusing Fanny with a little of Jane Austen's personality (through her letters and early writing) was a charming reinvention that didn't change Fanny in her essentials. She is still uncompromisingly moral and still trusts herself unflinchingly.<br /><br />I appreciated the film's focus on the slave trade. It added a lot to the characters of Sir Thomas and Tom to contrast the world of manners with the barbaric \\"interests in Antigua\\" that make it all possible. The issues and the manner in which they were addressed were historical and they added to the plot. The rich had worse vices than bored housewives, after all.<br /><br />Edward was not a very compelling romantic lead in this movie. I thought that was its weakest point. My only other criticism is that there were no front-hook corsets in this period -- but movies always ignore that. It's a tradition :) The costuming and the setting were beautiful. The music fit the mood of the film perfectly
B0012QTA8O|5.0|This particular version of the Crowley Deck seems to be a more workable size for spreads.  I tend to like to do the 21 card spread and the relationship spread, and both of these would take a significant amount of room with the larger decks.  From an artistic point of view, this deck includes the other versions of the Magus card that were done by the artist.  They are interesting in that you might prefer one of the others.  I use all of them and let the readings choose.  The Crowley deck is vibrant, sensual, and bold compared to the usual Waite deck.  Unlike the Waite deck, too, it has more feminine elements (Princess rather than Page).  Since the Tarot Deck is connected with the Qabalah and the Qabalah emphasizes male and female balance, I feel this is more correct.
