B00371QQ8Y|5.0|I loved this movie when it came out and I was a teenager. It struck a chord with me as a very relevant incredibly well written, well acted movie. I felt it did the best job of anything conveying the depth and complexity of America's drug situation. I could associate with the teenagers in the movie because I knew those characters in real life.  I won't waste your time debating the ins and outs of the War on Drugs. No. I will say though that I just picked up Traffic on Blu-Ray, and watching it again through adult eyes, it has lost absolutely none of its punch. It is taut, it is incredibly well shot, well acted, and well written. All of the locations feel completely authentic. The dialogue is natural. This film deserved every award it won, and then some.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love this cover for my kindle! It is very functional. It keeps it clean and protected and it also works as a stand if I don't want to hold it. It is a bit flimsy in the stand mode though. Have to be careful to get it set up just right. But overall, this cover is great!
B004045I86|5.0|I avoided the movie in deference to the book, and certainly glad that I did.  Don't let the length of the book intimidate, because Larsson's writing style will engage readers, and pull them through the crowd of characters to an unexpected finish.
B005EM8O8O|2.0|I have read most of Robert Harrris's books and was awaiting this one with anticipation!  However - I was very disappointed. The first 70 pages of this book are verging on bad and almost not worth reading - however, it did get slightly better. But for a topic that has been covered quite a lot in the past couple of years - I really expected more - both from the book and the author.  The general theme at the end is very similar to another great book - but wont say which for fear of a spolier alert - my guess he was trying to copy the theme - but it doest work here.  If you are new to his author - do NOT start with this book, and if you are buying the book based on its subject matter - there are far better factual books and also thrillers out there on the subject.  Am hoping his next book will be back to his usual standard...

B0024RID60|5.0|Some Girls Is a Stones album from way back and In My opinion their 2nd best only to EXILE ON MAIN ST . I dont think the year it was recorded is important because the music is timeless , good ole rock and roll definitely aimed at the mail gender side . Some Girls is one of those albums that ,  people like me who have been listening to Rock and Roll for 40 years plus , that we have gotten through all formats I E , album , cassette tape , CD , and now finally on our MP3 players , and will get on whatever comes out next , if I have enough energy left to do it . Anybody who loves classic rock will enjoy this CD as it has at least 3 or 4 songs on it that hit the Radio from time to time and were instant classics . Enjoy and \\" never be a beast of burden \\"  geofer

B0067LY4WG|5.0|This is the most honest and therefore best Leonard Cohen album I've ever heard.  I saw him in concert last year and loved it, but wondered if his creative time had ended, since the concert was a direct take from his \\"Essentials\\" album, although being in the South (Atlanta) he didn't perform 'Democracy'.  But this album proves me wrong.  If you like the darker side of Cohen, buy this CD.

B000FC1JCQ|5.0|An an amazing Arthurian saga... truly a must read. Written from the point of view of Morgaine (pagan priestess), Arthur's half-sister and the villian of traditional Arthur tales. Unique in perspective with strong female characters. It is a story of love; and quite different from any Arthur novel you'll ever read. Marion Zimmer Bradley is an incredible storyteller with impressive knowledge of the ancient Goddess based spirituality.<br />One of my favorites, I can read this over and over again.
B0032O6S4I|4.0|I bought the Playmobile Zoo after a lot of research trying to find a large Zoo set that was reasonably priced for my 3 1/2 year old grandson.  He loves animals and the set really fills the bill.  The only drawback we have found at all is that the largest elephant came broken and we have not been able to resolve that problem yet.  I don't think it was broken during shipping either, because the problem looks more like a factory mistake.  Amazon had the best price and the shipping was easy.

0316010669|1.0|I'm taking the time to write this review only to add to the numbers of 1-star reviews, and therefore hopefully give potential buyers pause before purchasing. I don't know when I've been so disappointed by a book. The reason why I was so disappointed is because the introduction to the book, and the cover of the book stating it's about \\"the power of thinking without thinking,\\" leads one to believe you're going to get some solid information about how to harness the power of thinking without thinking. Psych! Instead the book is (as the majority of reviews 2-stars and below point out) just a bunch of random anecdotes which teach the reader nothing about how to harness the power of thinking without thinking. The book cover and introduction are slick marketing which wrongfully lead the buyer to believe he or she will be getting some valuable information about how to begin effectively making snap decisions, and instead spend their time reading myriad stories about people who have made snap decisions. Super helpful. It's like booking a hotel online which promises an \\"ocean view,\\" then getting to the hotel and realizing it's nowhere near the beach.  I will say that I relied on my gut feeling and started skimming through the book about 1/3 of the way through to see if he was ever going to actually provide any useful tools relating to making split decisions. After skimming to about 2/3's of the way through, I decided to move to Amazon reviews, which confirmed my impression that the book was never going to get anywhere. So there's an anecdote he can put in a future, revised edition of the book. My gut feeling saved me from experiencing the even greater annoyance I would have had by spending my time finishing a book that was already getting on my nerves.

But, hey, that's what makes it a great book.  I love writers who aren't afraid to kill or change their characters!  It makes me sad but it makes the book better, well if it is written well.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a very fun and strategic game which requires planning in order to get through the more difficult levels.
1601253788|5.0|Another great addition to the Pathfinder library. This Bestiary delves into a lot of eastern mythology, with creatures from India, China, Japan, and Russia. They also touch on Mesoamerican mythos a bit, and they've given a lot of options for underwater encounters as well. All in all, a lot of unique additions to the monster stable, and some really interesting new options.
B005OK722U|3.0|In Hostel (2005), Eli Roth (writer/director) spun the story of an Eastern European Mom'n'Pop farmhouse business where private members would pay top dollar to torture American tourists.  Like any murder movie of the time, it was told through the eyes of the victems.  Roth (again, writer/director, and now characters/producer) changed things up a little in Hostel II (2007), in which the viewers got a taste of the abductors' and torture club members' perspective.  For extra flavor, Roth peppered in some international membership from America played by Roger Bart and Richard Burgi, two upperclass white family men.  I doubt that it is any coincidence that both of these actors were from Desperate Housewives.  In this third installment Roth has little involvement--only a character writing credit--taking a back seat to a writer and director who have had little major success.  This had me very skeptical, however the director did have a writing credit on Evil Dead 2 (his only claim to next-to-fame) and the production value and acting look good.  If only that were enough.  The loss of Roth should be considered the loss of the franchise.<br /><br /> John Hensley (FX's Nip/Tuck, Teeth) plays the opposite of his typical casting: lame, passive, and conservative; the Ed Helmsley of The Hangover.  Kip Pardue (Drive, The Wizard of Gore remake-2007) plays more like The Hangover's Bradley Cooper.  Then there's the well-to-do but possibly corruptible bachelor and the driven-bitter-by-marriage guy who seeks excitement.  These four are having a bachelor party in Vegas.<br /><br /> After a few drinks and hands of blackjack they are invited to a wild venue way off the strip with a couple of too-hot-to-be-talking-to-you local chicks.  They go.  Then, long story short, they have someone play \\"Operation\\" on them.  This flick truly is like a tutorial for girls and guys to NEVER take a drink from ANYONE.  Not even if they open the bottle in front of you because, evidently, they bought the Ruf&eacute; & Chandon Brut Classic for your champagne toast.<br /><br /> The theme is more high-tech than parts I and II.  There's a sterile \\"hobby\\" room, an audience with cocktails and laptops looking into a glass exhibit room, and everything is managed online.  It all seems a little too sophisticated, kind of like the drugged-up chick auction in Taken--sparkling wine, Armani and high rollers.  There are some attempts at goring us out including a pretty serious scene pulling off the skin from someone's entire face.  But other than that one \\"moment\\" of awesome, I really felt like this flick missed the point of the Hostel franchise.  The story was told from the director's perspective, not through the eyes of the victem or assailant.  The torture scenes were short and limited to a gimmick (for example, shooting someone with a crossbow until they die), we didn't \\"see\\" enough happen, and there was no relationship between the tortured and the torturer, as in terror and fear met by a sick rush of euphoria.  As if it wasn't mediocre enough, the writers tried to slap almost half a dozen twists on us--none of them were well-received.  Really, they didn't make a difference to me at all.<br /><br /> I'm not denying that I was entertained, but I'll never watch this movie again.  In fact, this movie was recommended by a friend of mine.  I'm currently re-evaluating that friendship.  LOL.  Hostel (2005) and Hostel II (2007), by all means, have the gore and intensity you wanted to see when you rented this by accident.  I'd also refer you to franchise flicks from Saw and Cube.  But skip this movie.  I'd rather have my left nut caught in a car door than watch this again.for your champagne toast.   The theme is more high-tech than parts I and II.

B005JSM5YW|1.0|This review is not a reflection of the movie itself; this is one of my favorite chick flicks of all time, the cast is awesome and the story rocks.  That said, the ultraviolet DVD copy is awful for 99% of the population.

B00631VJIC|4.0|A soundtrack album for 'Sons oF Anarchy' was always going to be excellent with such a wide and varied selection of music to choose from. The problem was always going to be 'What to put in and what to leave out'. I can't really quibble with the choices on this disc, the theme song, the Katey Sagal selections, Paul Brady's mad version of 'Gimme Shelter' are all excellent but with so much left out I would have preferred a double disc with some of the stuff left out such as 'The Black Keys' stuff from series one, 'The Dropkick Murphys' version of 'Johnny I Hardly Knew ye' and especially the magnificently poetic  season 4 opening scene where the sons get out of prison soundtracked by 'Joshua James' song 'Coal War'
B006UG90RM|5.0|How phony some of these reviews are! It's incredibly obvious that the vast majority of the negative reviews were written by Sammy Hagar lovers who for some reason think that Dave putting out another great album with Van Halen somehow detracts from Red's legacy with the band. It's just childish; Sammy's moved on. In fact, I understand he's doing quite well for himself. Chickenfoot's music's pretty good (ok, I'm being generous here, but I thought I'd extend an olive branch...Oh, hell, screw it, I'll be straight up. I gave it a try, but CF bores the crap out of me). Other reviews here have been written by people who simply have no love for this type of music. Whatever; I don't understand them or their motives either, but to each his own. I'll admit that it sort of perplexes me as to why they feel the urge to post reviews about types of music they clearly dislike. But to call ADKOT anything less than a triumphant return to form for the ultimate good-time hard rock band is both disingenuous and baffling. This album is a shot across the bow at the current state of commercial music, and hopefully a wake-up call for a stagnant genre as well. ADKOT is an absolute showcase of rock and roll mastery and I can't help thinking that every true rocker since Chuck Berry's time must love it. It's not moaning grunge; it's not overproduced bubblegum. It's straight-up rock, the way it's supposed to be played, by one of the most talented rock bands the world has ever known. This isn't about \\"love walking in.\\" See Sammy for that. If you require deep meaning in your lyrics and lots of soft, introspective lulls, you've come to the wrong album. Roth's version of Van Halen is more about hooks, toe-tapping beats, hit & run witticisms. It's about leaping to your feet to yell and to smile and dance, and it's about tapping your hands on the steering wheel as you push the speed limit down sunny summer highways. Anonymous posters with agendas will continue to have their say, of course; that's the unavoidable, ugly part of the internet. But it's quite simple, really; if you love great, real, good-time hard rock, you'll love this terrific album.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|i am an avid reader.  this is easily one of my top ten best book ever.  it is hauntingly disturbing. on several occasions this book acually took my breath away.  the big question is this........  are sociopaths,sexual deviants etc.. born evil.  are they wired different.  this book will make you ponder it all.  this book will stay with you longer than it will take to read.  enjoy.  youve been warned this book is not for the faint at heart.....

B0073PZIYI|4.0|IN TIME is better than I expected.  Writer/director Andrew Niccol has fashioned an intriguing tale of a futuristic world where time is literally money.  Of course the richer you are, the more time you have.  In this world, everyone looks 25 no matter how old you really are, so don't look for any cameos from Harrison or Clint.<br />My main problem with IN TIME is the miscasting of Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried.  While Justin is to be commended for his acting diversity e.g. THE SOCIAL NETWORK, BAD TEACHER etc., I found it hard to accept him as an action hero.  Seyfried has a commanding screen presence more effective in lighter fare e.g. MAMMA MIA, LETTERS FROM JULIET, etc.  She looks great with the 80s brunette pageboy but comes off a little vapid.  The supporting cast fares much better.  Cillian Murphy brings a strong dedication to his role as the Timekeeper.  Vincent Kartheiser is appropriately cold and prudish as millionaire father of Seyfried.  WHITE COLLAR's Matt Bomer evinces pathos as Justin's generous but doomed donator.  HOUSE's beautiful Olivia Wilde in a brief role as Justin's mother (?) is effective.  Alex Pettyfrew as the smarmy time-thug and Johnny Galecki as the loyal friend round out the cast.<br />All in all, a decent visage of a future where time is of the essence.

Well, I had no other book on the train and nothing else to do so pretty much read the whole thing. I say pretty much because I stopped with about 30 pages to go. I got to the end and I just felt disgusted with the writer and with myself for reading this book.

As my wrist tattoo says: d.f.t.b.a.!
0307957934|2.0|Disappointing for me.  Like many other reviewers, I'm a big Robert Harris fan--his historical fiction is terrific.  \\"The Fear Index\\" went a little too far toward sci-fi without fully preparing a layman reader like me for what was technically possible or what was actually happening.  My own lack of technical knowledge of the mechanical workings of the contemporary stock markets was no doubt a factor in limiting my understanding and enjoyment of the novel's plot.<br /><br />While trying to avoid open spoilers, I still have to wonder out loud what the motivations of the story's \\"villain\\" were.  Why send a book?  Why order a murder ala Hannibal Lechter?  Why buy an art collection?  There weren't any direct answers to these and other questions on offer other than a kind of suggestion that they amounted to events in a struggle of man vs.mechanical beast.<br /><br />This is a short book meant to entertain for a few hours. It will do that for many people.  For me there wasn't enough there there.

1451648537|5.0|This biography of Steven Jobs, co-founder of Apple, was written by Walter Isaacson, whose previous works include biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein.  Isaacson mentions (only partially in jest) that in persuading him to write his biography, Jobs felt himself a logical successor to the other two subjects.<br /><br />After reading Isaacson's work, I can say that Steve Jobs is one of the most original, fascinating figures of the last 200 years.  It goes without saying that he is one of the most influential; a visionary, a revolutionary and a trailblazer almost without peer.  Jobs has quite simply changed the landscape in personal computing, animated movies, music, tablet computing and communications.  He deserves a spot alongside Thomas Edison, Benjamin Franklin and Leonardo DaVinci among the brilliant minds of western civilization.<br /><br />That is not to say that Jobs is without his warts, and Isaacson catalogs many of them in this biography.  As you might imagine, he was a free spirit as a teenager, dabbling in psychedelic drugs, marijuana, Zen Buddhism along with other counter culture pursuits of his contemporaries.  He spent time in India, seeking the meaning of life, and fathered and abandoned a child in his early twenties.  He was at times cruel, rude, inconsiderate and impatient with those not as brilliant as himself (which means virtually everyone).  He could be generous at times, while at others, amazingly petty and vindictive.  It has been advanced that Jobs suffered from Narcissistic Personality Disorder, the inability to display empathy for others.  He also exhibited Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in his seemingly endless quest for absolute perfection in design of both his products and manufacturing processes.  He was likely bi-polar, but his genius cannot be denied.<br /><br />For years, we've taught our businessmen to \\"give the customer what he wants.\\"  Jobs has turned that theory on its head, creating new and original products, then convincing the consuming public why they NEEDED it, because it is not enough to say that he was a visionary; he is perhaps an even better marketer and salesman than a developer of products.<br /><br />This is one of the best biographies I've read, partially due to the fascination that Jobs evokes, but even more due to the fact that Isaacson paints a complete picture of this complex individual, warts and all.  It has the added benefit of chronicling the advent of the technology movement, its key figures and companies from the 70s through the present, a spellbinding treat in itself.why they NEEDED it, because it is not enough to say that he was a visionary; he is perhaps an even better marketer and salesman than a developer of products.

0060873027|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed this book, the story flowed nicely and it kept me turning the pages to see what happens next. A lot of people are criticizing this book because they find the story far fetched or not realistic, but there are plenty of other books that are like that as well. This story is no less believable than Jurassic Park was with a world full of extinct dinosaurs that are brought to life. It's a work of fiction. I think it all depends on how open minded you are to the idea of being shrunk to the size of insects and interacting with that world, if you can't accept that idea than this book is not for you, otherwise I think it's a great story.
1440503257|5.0|This book is amazing.  I have cooked tons of the recipes so far and I have loved all of them.  My family begs me to cook for them and bake for all events.  All of the tips are very helpful and its fun to read all of the historical facts.  Also the best part is the enchanting Harry Potter theme.  I feel like I am at Hogwarts or the Burrow when I present the meals I cook.  It is fun that the book reminds you where in the book the food or beverage was mentioned and why.  This is one of my favorite all time purchases!!!
B005CA4SJW|1.0|First off let me say I love the series. I like the writing, directing, and the in your face style of filming.  I purchased the \\"The Complete First Season 3-Disc Special Edition, based on the reviews here.  While watching my new purchase I was EXTREMELY DISAPOINTED while watching Ep.# 2 \\"Guts\\" in the scene where they run into the alley to grab the walker to dismember and use his guts and body parts for camouflage, that entire sequence is edited out of this supposedly complete special edition.  It shows them grabbing the walker and bringing him into the building and closing the door and the next thing you see is them walking out the door covered in the guts and parts.  The whole 3-min+ scene is gone where they talk about who he(the walker) was before and starting to chop him into pieces.  One of the most graphic scenes in the series so far and its not on the complete special edition discs!!!  I am equally dumbfounded that previeous reviewers failed to mention this.  Had I known this was an edited edition I would have purchased a non-edited version.  I feel totally ripped off and let down by Amazon and previous reviewers not to have disclosed this until now.  BUYER BEWARE THIS 3-DISC SPECIAL EDITION SERIES IS EDITED !!!!!!!!!!

0312370849|5.0|I loved Sarah's Key by Tatiane de Rosnay. The chapters are broken up into the present and the past and they alternate. The story opens with the French Roundup of Jews in 1942...police are knocking at doors in the middle of the night...a little French girl named Sarah and her parents are taken by the French police, but the little girl had a brother. She thought they would be returning shortly so she locks her brother in a panel (where they play hide and seek) in order to keep him safe. She holds onto that key throughout her journey. She is sent to a concentration camp. The second story-line of the book is about a woman American journalist who has lived in France for many years. She is married to a French man and she has a daughter. She is given the assignment of writing about this French Roundup because it is the anniversary of the event. This journalist and her family are about to move into her husband's grandmother's apartment that they are renovating. There is a connection between this apartment and the apartment of the little girl Sarah.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I give this book 5 stars because of the truth and honesty that Jaycee shared with all of us. I dont care how its written-none of that mattered to me..its her story that is moving!<br /><br /> I found the first few chapters VERY difficult to read, and even put it down for a few weeks thinking I cant read this anymore! It is graphic in detail but I thought Jaycee wanted the world to know what this pervert did to her to show the monster he, and his wife really are! I feel there is alot more to her story that is probably much worse then what is in this book.<br /> Its amazing to me that she held it together all those years, and even tried to continue to learn on her own and be a mother. This book made me cry, made me happy, and made me angry and disgusted! Once I read thru those first graphic chapters the rest was much easier to read, and I found myself not able to put it down.<br /> I hope much can be learned about Jaycee's story and changes can be made to how we handle people like the Garrido's! There was history with this man prior to him getting his hands on Jaycee...unfortunatly he was able to fool, and manipulate everyone around him including law enforcement!

1439102813|5.0|Still Alice by Lisa Genova is an excellent story. However, it tackles an extremely emotional subject matter, Alzheimer's Disease. The book is so well done,  well written and meaningful, if you can handle the sad story-line, you should read it. The story will stay with you. Many of my family members suffered with Alzheimer's Disease and I was reluctant to read this book, but I am glad that I did. It is a quick read, but by no means an easy one. It gives you Alzheimer's Disease from the patient's perspective, in this case, a Harvard graduate and Professor. If you didn't know that it was a novel, you would think that it was a work of non-fiction. The writing is simply that good.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|Seeing that it was more than a two hour movie, I figured half way through I would get some food and drink to carry me on to the end.......but! this touching film captured my spirit so that I didn't want to waste a moment on mundane things.  After suffering severe trauma recently, this remarkable film has released emotions in me that needed to be untrapped.  Much feeling in this message, a realness, an invitation to looking beyond \\"what feels good\\" to grasping hold of what really is good and right.  Integrity, where have you been?  We have missed you in the gaudy, the impure, the \\"me-first\\", the mocking of the upright and saluting the depraved.  For the first time in a while, I feel clean after watching a real and exciting as well as very well-done movie.

0307959856|2.0|I could hardly believe that P.D. James had written this!  I am a big P.D. James fan, a multiple reader of her books -- there's something about how she makes modern England come alive in her prose that is way beyond most writers.  But \\"Death at Pemberley\\" was pure drivel.  The characters of Darcy and Elizabeth are not at all developed as older people in a marriage.  There is no Austen wit and some characters who might have contributed some kind of flavor (Lydia and Wickham) are 2-dimensional. The murder is completely off the wall and the denouement made absolutely no sense! And worse than everything, Mr. Collins never gets to appear!  I really can't believe she wrote this and then agreed to publish it.  Don't waste your money.  Get one of her old ones instead.
0062060562|4.0|I really enjoyed Before I Go to Sleep by S.J. Watson. It is much different from what I usually read. It is about a woman who has a memory disorder from when she was in an accident. She only has memories from a very long time ago. She is married and each morning her husband has to remind her of her condition, who he is, her life, etc. She secretly starts seeing a therapist who asks her to keep a journal. Each morning the therapist calls to tell her where to find the journal. Each morning she reads the journal and knows what is happening to her. One day when she starts her day, she rereads a passage from her diary that says she no longer trusts her husband. This book held my interest throughout. It was thought-provoking and engaging. The ending was slightly off for me, but it is still a book I highly recommend reading.

1594203334|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and am grateful to the author for sharing her experience!  I love the fact that there is a general philosophy that many of the French seem to follow.  In the US, there are so many philosophies that sometimes I feel confused as well as my children.  Obviously no society is perfect, but the French do quite a few things well and parenting should be added to the list.  I was an au pair in France twenty years ago and really fell in love with the way that the family unit works.  I read the book rather quickly and just watched the interview.  Although I have to admit that Pamela is not great in this interview and the beret does add a cheesey \\"pas tres chic\\" touch, the book is actually well written as well as funny.  I  agree with many of her thoughts and appreciate that she took the time to interview everyday people as well as experts to make sure that there was consistency in her findings.  Bravo Pamela and Thank you!

0062082353|1.0|I wanted to like this book. I wanted to like his story and the reasons for what the author does. But after reading this book, I left feeling that Chris is an egotistical, self absorbed, cold, distant, man who cares very little for his wife and children and who prefers life as a warrior instead of that of a husband and father. I agree with his wife that Chris clearly wanted to re- up than stay with her and the children.  And I completely resented the comment in the book when he said his wife \\" found herself pregnant again with their second child.\\" Chris, she got pregnant because you got her that way. If you didn 't want a second child to interfere with your war games,  you should have left her alone.  Chris cared more about his comrades than his family and his boasting of killing did not make me feel proud of him. It made me ashamed that there are men such as Chris that have so little respect for human life- people are just potential targets to Chris.  There is a part in the book in which Chris comes across a dying soldier who is a young man who asks Chris to tell his family that e didn't die in pain. This dying young man was trying so hard to be brave even though  he was mortally wounded. Chris just brushed this young man off and showed no compassion for him.  I would be interested in reading a book written by Chris's wife. Her feelings and statements were the highlight of the book. And I would like to know why she didn't divorce him. She deserves better.  I am glad I didn't purchase this book. I Returned it to the library as soon as I close the back cover. Chris Kyle is not my idea of a hero. He's just a brute with a gun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had heard this one was slower than the first, but I actually read this book in an entire day! It is so well written that you cannot just put the book down. You are anxiously awaiting all of the twist and turns. I finished this one, got some sleep and started the third!
B004LROMQG|5.0|I've always loved reading and watching things about Camelot, King Arthur and his Knights, and Merlin.  It's a time period I've always been curious about.  The idea of a T.V. series based on Arthur and Merlin as \\"Young Adults\\", and how their friendship began, is fun and interesting.  Over the past three seasons, I think the acting has just gotten better.  I'd recommend this series for anyone who likes the stories and ideas of Camelot.  I've recently gotten my sister addicted to this series and she watched the first 2 seasons in about 3 days.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Listen there are plenty of other versions you can go buy if you cant appreciate this blu ray version.  I thought it was amazing. The picture on my 55 inch plasma looked unreal and it was a lot of fun. Yes there have been some major touch ups on each dvd but i think that is the fun of blu ray. Im just as much as a film geek as the next person and i love all these cool versions of different movies coming out. Anyways, if you are looking for a visual joyride then i recommend this as a part of your collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If I would have read the description about what this book was about, I would not have taken a chance on it. However, it had such rave reviews, I had to check it out. It was not my genre, but there are so many intertwined stories in this story. It was beautiful, heart wrenching, heartfelt, and so well written. I could not help but fall in love with the characters. I read the first book in two days and immediately bought the other two!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was feeling as if I was addicted to this trilogy, and MockingJay solidified that for me! So many twist, you hate a character, then by the next sentence you realize you love them. So many twist and turns. My jaw dropped more time than I can count! I cried in parts, but it is very action filled. Although the ending is unexpected in many ways (no worries- that isn't a spoiler, you wonder things the entire time), some parts were devastatingly tragic, but the outcome of the three books answered all of the questions the previous ones left you with.  Even if the description of the time period, or gruesomeness of fighting to the death to feed your \\"District\\" does not seem appealing (to me I thought I'd hate the books); do NOT let that discourage you from reading these well written, heartfelt, griping books. You'll be glad you did!
B006UG90RM|5.0|\\"Heard ya missed us - we're baaaack!\\"  It's been 28 long years since the day I went out and bought the \\"1984\\" album - a day I still remember vividly. I recall, as a 14-year old Van Halen fanatic, the excitement I felt the second I held the album in my hands on that cold January morning, staring intently at every inch of the cover and inner sleeve, as if looking for some untold Secret of the Universe. Little did I, or any Van Halen fan, know that it would take all the way until 2012 for David Lee Roth and Van Halen to make a \\"follow-up\\" to it. But the day that no fan ever thought would happen has finally arrived. Hell must have, indeed, frozen over. If so, then let's hope the thaw never arrives because Van Halen has just pulled off a miracle for the ages - against all the odds.  As we all know, a lot of blood and words have been spilled over the past couple of decades, coming from all parties involved. Theirs is a sordid history - Dave leaving, Sammy Hagar taking over, Hagar leaving, Dave almost coming back, Gary Cherone, hip replacements, substance abuse problems, failed comebacks, Michael Anthony being unceremoniously dumped, and then, finally, just silence - a long, deafening silence. Was this band, which had started to look like a running joke with all the constant turmoil and bickering and personnel changes, finally finished for good? Eddie, who was always mentioning how he had tons of material in his vaults, just seemed to be fading away into a permanent, burned-out retirement, while Dave's star had long faded. The only members who seemed to be thriving were Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony, who, along with Joe Satriani, formed the supergroup Chickenfoot and were beating Van Halen at their own game - not to mention tending to their successful tequila and hot sauce business ventures.  As far as Dave and Eddie were concerned, though, most of us were skeptical whether they could actually bury the hatchet and work together again in any kind of meaningful way. They went out on a successful tour and seemed to enjoy playing together, but could they cut it in the studio or had they grown too far apart, musically and personally, over the years, to ever find common ground again? We all feared that they would just sound like over-the-hill has-beens trying to compete in a musical world that had long passed them by. After all these years, could they really capture lightning in a bottle a second time around? Well, I'm as happy as any fan to report that the verdict is in and the results are amazing and well worth the wait. For the first time in many years, they have a future instead of just a past. What could have turned out to be an embarrassing failure is, instead, a total triumph from start to finish. \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" is the sound of a band resurrected from the grave and ready to take over the world once more. They may never again be the young, longhaired rock gods that ruled the earth once upon a time, and, yes, they are now in their late-50s, but you certainly wouldn't know it from their latest comeback. And they are, indeed, BACK!  This album is PRIMAL, with a \\"take no prisoners\\" attitude. It's the aural equivalent of a gang fight. It could be, in fact, the heaviest they have ever put out - at least since their classic first album - and it begs you to blast it at top volume while speeding down the highway. The band has mostly eschewed pop catchiness in favor of speed and unbridled energy. Eddie tears up his guitar like a mofo, playing with a flash, command and speed that he hasn't shown in decades, proving once again why he was, and still is, considered THE guitarist of his generation. The man is just BEYOND. It's like he's been locked away for the past several years and someone just let him loose. He shows off every trick that he has in his musical arsenal and sprinkles his brilliance all over \\"Truth.\\"  Alex also sounds unleashed, playing at much faster tempos and with more brutal intensity than he has since the early days, regularly working the double-kick drum and sounding at times like he is auditioning for a speed metal band. He's the god of thunder driving these songs into the stratosphere. Eddie and Alex play like men half their age. I'm not sure if it's Dave's being back in the band or if it's the influence of young Wolfgang on bass, but the energy and intensity never lets up. And Dave sounds hungry and ferocious - perhaps not as flamboyant as in the past, but with all his charisma intact - and with little of the Vegas-style shtick that he has sometimes shown over the years. He sounds like a man who has been waiting many years to make his grand return to the mountaintop, and he damn well makes the most of this second chance.  This album also shows Wolfgang coming into his own and silencing all the detractors that said he was only there because he's Eddie's son, as well as the fans who were angry because of Michael Anthony not being invited to participate in the reunion. From the recorded results of this album, though, you get the impression that Eddie must have told his son, \\"I want you to contribute ideas to this band as much as any of us and prove to me that you truly belong here.\\" And the kid does - in spades. He totally nails the opening bass riff to \\"She's the Woman\\" (originally performed, of course, by Mike), and for that alone, he belongs in this band. He doesn't stop there though. At every turn he impresses and proves just who's son he truly is. As much as Mike will always be loved and missed by the fans, Wolfgang has earned his stripes.  This is a band with something to prove. You can hear them wanting to silence every critic, every skeptical fan, past band members and maybe even themselves, as well as each other - as if they are taking all the aggression and insults they traded over the years and channeling it into the music - with absolutely mind-blowing results.  Most of these songs don't catch you instantly the way \\"Jump,\\" \\"Dance the Night Away\\" or \\"Panama\\" didback in their day, but that doesn't mean that they don't eventually work their way into your brain. Case in point: first single \\"Tattoo,\\" which despite the constant criticism fans and critics have been surprisingly heaping on it, is actually a very strong single. It is one of those songs that grows with each new listen, and has great lyrics and memorable singing and playing from Dave and Eddie. Perhaps everyone was just approaching it with unreasonable demands considering how long we have all waited for this reunion to take place. I admit that I wasn't knocked out the first time I heard it, but I now think it's a great single and the perfect way to begin the album.  \\"She's the Woman,\\" \\"Big River\\" (originally entitled \\"Big Trouble\\") and \\"Outta Space\\" (originally \\"Let's Get Rockin'\\") are from the 1976 \\"Zero\\" demos that Gene Simmons produced in order to get VH their recording contract with Warner Bros. The demo also contained future classics like \\"Runnin' with the Devil,\\" \\"House of Pain\\" and \\"Atomic Punk.\\" How these three songs never made it onto an album until now is amazing. These are songs that would have fit in well on the first three albums. Detractors might say that VH is resurrecting these old songs (as well as \\"Tattoo,\\" which is based on another early song called \\"Down in Flames\\") simply because they can't come up with enough new material. I believe, though, that they are using them as simply a way to reconnect with their early roots and bring this whole reunion full circle. It's almost like they had to retrace their steps in order to move ahead into the future. Most of all, though, they are just damn good songs. They are probably the catchiest ones on the album and certainly fit in seamlessly with the newer material. Van Halen certainly do the songs justice, capturing the spirit and sound of the original demos - even going beyond all expectations, with the only notable difference being Dave's deeper voice. Anyhow, VH has many times resurrected old material orrecycled parts of songs (for example, the bridge in the original demo of \\"She's the Woman\\" was later used for \\"Mean Streets\\"), so who cares if they are still raiding their early material? With songs this strong, they'd be crazy not to use them. \\"She's the Woman\\" is probably the best song on the album and might have made an even stronger first single than \\"Tattoo.\\" It's definitely everything that you ever loved about this band. It's Van Halen hot-wired and bad-ass, and sounding as tight as ever. The same can also be said for \\"Big River.\\" This is simply classic old school hard rock. In fact, the most exciting moment on the album might just be the beginning of \\"She's the Woman.\\" Eddie and Wolfgang open with a monstrous bass and guitar riff before Alex's drums detonate and the band is off and running. By the time Dave starts singing the verses you know you're in the middle of VH-style nirvana.  Another highlight of the album is \\"You and Your Blues,\\" which actually sounds like a bridge between the Roth and Hagar versions of VH. There are moments of the song that you could picture Sammy singing, but then other sections that only Dave could sing.  It also shows just how much Van Halen was the \\"same yet different\\" with Sammy at the helm. They both make great lead singers of this band, but Dave just has that little bit of extra charisma that makes him the ultimate frontman for Van Halen. This album reaffirms that, and makes you realize what had been missing all these years. That's no knock on Sammy either (I thought the \\"Van Hagar\\" years had their own uniquely great moments), but this is simply the band we first fell in love with - old school Van Halen. Another thing I noticed is how the tempos have mostly speeded up again. They rarely played with this much intensity and at such rapid-fire tempos when Sammy was in the band.  The melodic and memorable \\"Blood and Fire\\" is a self-referential number that has Dave stating matter-of-factly, \\"I told ya I was coming back.\\" It is based on an instrumental idea of Eddie's called \\"Ripley.\\" \\"Bullethead,\\" another old number, is a surprise, which shows a Black Flag influence on the chorus, amazingly enough, and \\"As Is\\" also shows off a bit of a punkish attack with Dave barking out the chorus like an army sergeant. The song moves through some complex chord changes and then breaks down into an acoustic section, before returning to the main riff. Eddie outdoes himself here.  \\"China Town\\" begins with Eddie showing off some of his amazing tapping technique before the song takes flight. It also features great, passionate singing by Dave and a blistering solo from Ed, and is another highlight of the album. \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll\\" begins with a more modern, experimental vibe before Eddie takes off once again, burning up the fretboard, as he also does on \\"The Trouble with Never.\\" Then Dave shows off his playful side on the beginning of \\"Stay Frosty\\" (is that him on acoustic guitar?) before the whole band kicks in for another high energy number.  The album finishes on a high note with \\"Big River\\" and \\"Beats Workin'\\" (yet another early demo, originally called \\"Put Out the Lights\\") and the last thing we hear, appropriately enough, is the sound of Eddie's guitar trailing off into a cloud of feedback.  And there you have it. An album as amazing as any VH fan could have prayed for, with great performances and production - this definitely holds its own with the original six classic albums. Yes, it would have been nice if Michael Anthony could have been part of this reunion (his backing vocals are missed in places, though Wolfgang fills in admirably). It's too bad that both he and Wolfgang couldn't be involved somehow, but he seems happier playing with Sammy in Chickenfoot, so this story seems to have found an unlikely happy ending all the way around.  Nobody thought this reunion could possibly last due to all the failed attempts in the past and the years of acrimony between Dave and Eddie, plus the fact that Dave isnow outnumbered 3-1 by Van Halen family members. They seem to be thriving though, and on \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" they exceed all fans' expectations - and then some. It just proves that sometimes you really CAN go back home.  Let's hope that there will be more albums in the future from Dave, Eddie, Alex and Wolfie, but even if this was the last thing they ever recorded together, it would be the perfect bang to go out with.  In the meantime, though, welcome back guys - you've been missed.

1591396190|4.0|Although I enjoyed reading some of the case studies in Blue Ocean Strategy--e.g., about how Southwest Airlines and Calloway Golf were able to create niche markets in their sectors--I came away from my reading with the impression that the concept of a \\"blue ocean strategy,\\" although a catchy phrase, is not much different that concepts expressed, arguably with more rigor, by Michael Porter, beginning in his article, \\"What is Strategy?\\" in Harvard Business Review, November-December 1996. As an example, Porter states, \\"Competitive strategy is about being different. It means deliberately choosing a different set of activities to deliver a unique mix of value.\\" This sounds very much like the \\"blue ocean strategy\\" to me--despite Peter Leerskov's assertion that Michael Porter is the \\"guru behind the classic red ocean strategies.\\" In Porter's classic 1996 article, he even cites Southwest Airlines as an example of delivering \\"a unique mix of value.\\"  Nonetheless, as a \\"me too\\" book, I believe Blue Ocean Strategy is an interesting read.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing!  I absolutely did not want to read it, but told a friend that I would read it to make her happy.  It took me about 30 - 40 pages to get into it, but once I did, I could not stop reading.  I am a 6th grade teacher and many students are reading the series too.  I thought that it would be too childish for me, but it wasn't.  I was engulfed in the book and couldn't put it down.  Unfortunately, Catching Fire did not live up to The Hunger Games.  I would absolutely recommend this book!!

B004RJZA1E|5.0|In the spirit of Delain, Lacuna Coil, and Evanescence - Amaranthe bursts onto the scene with a powerful debut.  The production and maturity of the songs are noteworthy for their first effort.  This band has incredible potential for mass appeal due to their blending of progressive metal, pop, and yes, a growler!  Could be the next big thing!

B004O3YGMC|3.0|I thought this would be great...I'd be able to add things to reports at work when I was out of the office or at home.  It really wow'ed me when I tested it.  Unfortunately, the execution wasn't quite there through work computers on a large network.<br /><br />I was always able to get it to work when I was at my desk and could get both the computer and the Android sync'ed, but, whenever I was away from the office, one or the other devices couldn't access each other.  I checked their support forums and found that other users (lots) were having the same problems as I was.  Computer or Android could sit on the log in screen for over half an hour, trying to sign in.  This is posted by numerous people on their support site.  I implore you to go check it out.  Sometimes, I simply could not access the remote computer at all until I went back in to work and reset the software on the PC.  I needed reliability for this to be a worthwhile tool...what I wound up with was a novelty to show off with.<br /><br />When it did work, it was impressive.  I have full, almost real-time control of my remote computer.  It was complete control, of everything.  It was slightly annoying that my desktop icons got all screwed up because it actually resizes your desktop resolution to the resolution you selected for display on your Android (there is an option to leave your desktop resolution as it is, but then you have to scroll around your Android to see your whole desktop screen, making it pretty impractical).<br /><br />Even though I got this for document access/editing, I tested the much-touted video streaming.  Guess what...it worked, but the colors were pretty off.  Not psychedelic  or anything, but kind of like you got a cheap bootleg copy of the media you streamed...most likely due to heavy color compression for speed.<br /><br />I didn't bother trying it on my home computers, because, frankly, what do I need access to that I can't get on Evernote or Dropbox or Google Music or Amazon Cloud Storage?  Those services all ran much more reliably if all I wanted was to access media and such.  An older Android device might appreciate the ability to run Flash and Java apps remotely, but most stuff I want runs natively on Android these days anyway.  Plus, with Dropbox, etc, there's no color compression!<br /><br />I applaud these developers, but need better reliability before I could purchase something like this again.ore reliably if all I wanted was to access media and such.

0345455681|5.0|Rutherford has chosen the less lucrative path of literary vice commercial writer. I've read and enjoyed all of Rutherford's books which fit no genre but cross historical, mystery, romance, etc genres. He is one of the few modern authors that actually write literature in the tradition of dense plots, setting, characters and narrative.<br /><br />In looking through the reviews, I wondered why the reviews done by `A customer'; reviews done by popular authors who get to remain anonymous and an advanced copy to read seemed to relish their one or two star ratings. These are supposed pros! Other low rating Amazon reviewers hitting Rutherford's `London' up with low opinions include their list of complaints as sexist (the world was until a generation or so ago and mostly remains that way now!), boring, a Michener redux, doesn't make sense, unanswered questions (specifically the white streak in the hair, and webbed toes which = didn't finish it) are interesting indeed. Some admit to not finishing the book and that's fair ... I've thrown my share of fiction in the trash with an attitude and may well have ditched some the books written by Amazon's `A customer'.<br /><br />This is a 5-star read, period. It's absorbing in its massive scale and intimate in its stops along the timeline of London. The book is not about London, though the reader will certainly enjoy this aspect if you visit London. The book is about the people, the lineages that made the city from its first days to its modern. The DNA of the city is defined by those born within the sound of Saint Mary's. The long lost familial links play like a comedy and tragedy. `Bad' transfers from one generation to another and likewise `Good' transfers from one generation to another. Then after enough generations, `Good' and `Bad' change lineage. Good deeds are punished, bad deeds are rewarded but time is seen deliver grand and complex justice that causes pause to consider.<br /><br />The depth and breadth of all of Rutherford's works is staggering. He's at the top of my list for recommendation to the discerning reader. If fast reading pulp fiction is your preference, this is not your author or your book. I enjoy pulp fiction too, but the steady diet gives me gas after so much is written and consumed. Rutherford and his `London' deliver an experience that is unforgettable. The gopher-like travel that is London's tube travel is enhanced on every visit thanks to image Rutherford plants in readers psyche.<br /><br />If you haven't read it, and are a serious reader seeking a Michelin 3 star rated reading meal ... press buy now!works is staggering.

B006UG90RM|3.0|This is an agressive effort no doubt. Eddie Van Halen is shredding his ass off on this. There's no pop on this album. Eddie has clearly been bottled up too long, and he's wanting to rip. Normally that's a great thing. Here's the truth. This is not Van Halen. It's clear to me without Michael Anthony, there is no Van Halen. Wolfgang wants to shred as much as Eddie, and due to this, it's sounds more like Mr. Big with parallel shredding between Paul Gilbert and Billy Sheehan. The honest truth is most people don't want to hear prog rock shredding. They want to hear a groove, and Michael Anthony is an absolute groove master. If I had to bet, I'd say Eddie Van Halen recorded the bass tracks himself. David Lee Roth's voice is as good as ever, and the reason people think it's sub-par is because Michael Anthony is not there to harmonize with him. Don't get me wrong, this is worth listening to, but it's not Van Halen. Come on Eddie. bring Michael back, because I won't go see Van Halen until he's back.
B004TI5N38|5.0|John Puller is an investigator with the CID, the Criminal Investigative Unit based in Virginia. An experienced and accomplished soldier, Puller is sent to West Virginia to investigate the suspicious death of a DIA agent. Upon arriving in West Virginia, the mystery deepens further as Puller investigates DIA agent's death as that of his entire family. As the body count piles up, Puller teams up with local cop Samantha Cole in a race to find answers and uncovers an unexpected deception bigger than one man can possibly handle alone.<br /><br />One of the most impressive elements of this book is Baldacci's character dialogue. Staccato, fast paced, and completely authentic, the dialogue adds dimensions to the characters, situations, and places with flawless execution. Puller is a rough, ready and patriotic Army man who served six tours in Afghanistan and carries his fair share of scars and medals to prove it. You would expect a macho unstoppable machine without emotion but Baldacci does an excellent job of walking the line and creates a character with just the right mixture of humor, justified bravado based on experience and skilled training honed to a razor edge, with a nice touch of humanity. Puller has a soft spot and it shows through like a brief ray of sunshine, making him an extraordinarily likable character.<br /><br />Sergeant Samantha Cole is the perfect counterbalance to Puller. A feisty, seasoned cop who gives as good as she gets from Puller, she can stand her own and then some. The verbal banter between them is a joy to experience as the story evolves. A host of other characters complement the dynamic duo and provide layers of intrigue and mystery throughout. The language is crisp, clear, and exacting in its execution.<br /><br />There are times when you read a book and understand immediately why a writer is a bestseller. Baldacci is one of those writers. He is at the top of his game with Zero Day. Riveting, fast paced, with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing to the very end. This is one hot thriller and hopefully we'll see more of John Puller in the future. I could not put Zero Day down from the moment I read the free sample and finished the 434 pages within 24 hours - about eight hours reading time. This is one great winter read!s is one hot thriller and hopefully we'll see more of John Puller in the future.

B005OCFHHK|5.0|Just going to review the whole series, books and movies!  The writing is superb.  The movies are wonderfully done.  As an actual Witch, I would like to say that the type of Magick performed in these incredible books is not possible in actual life!  I would say that the closest thing to this type of Magick is Ceremonial Magick, which is not normally considered Pagan.  To quote Scotty from Star Trek, \\"You cannot change the laws of physics!\\"  You can do a lot with Magick, but the Laws Of The Universe cannot be changed!  Only The Divine Being can do that.  These books are mythology.  The classic G vs. E tale INCREDIBLY WELL DONE!  Teaches great values and is a wonderful morality tale.  J.K. Rowling created a Magickal, Mystical, and profoundly real Inner World!  And you can't learn actual Magick from these Magickal books and movies.  The very real Magick is the brilliance of them and how very easily you will enter the world of Harry Potter, and how very hard you will weep when Sirius is murdered, when one of the Weasly twins is murdered.  You will cheer when Molly kills Bellatrix, when Neville kills Nagini, and when Professor McGonnagall gets Hogwarts to join in the fight!  And of course, the final showdown between Harry and Voldemort ends in the only way possible!  Voldemort's Total Destruction!

B00000I8BX|5.0|This was my first Fear Factory album that I ever bought, I just got it a week ago. I was intrigued by the band when \\"obsolete\\" was first released but never bothered to pick it up. I got around to it about 12 years later and I must say that this is a really talented band. I would say they're a cross between Ministry and Stabbing Westward. They have their own style that is very heavy though.<br /><br />Anyway, the album \\"Obsolete\\" combines the extreme pounding metal elements with the melodic industrial singing and electronics. It is definitely an album worth picking up but it's not for people that don't like their heavy metal with intense and harsh vocals in the mix.<br /><br />The bonus songs on here for me are a mixed bag: the Car's cover is brilliant, the other cover about the murderer is mediocre and stale (frankly, kind of stupid too), the track after that isn't bad but isn't anything great either, Messiah is a pretty solid track for only having a few verses, and Concreto has great musicality but the vocal style is grating for me to tolerate.<br /><br />For those of you who've heard rumors about this band being anti-God or Satanist, that's completely wrong. While they are atheist, they still think that spirituality is a good thing. When they write lyrics involving religion, (\\"Pisschrist was a bit over the top) they are striking at organized religion for inciting fear and changing the entire nature of the teachings of God. If you understand this, this album and other Fear Factory albums might make a little more sense.<br /><br />This a great buy for anyone who likes heavy metal or industrial music. The bonus tracks except for the Cars song i could give or take but the album itself is solid.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love, love, loved it! Action packed. A good kick butt girl book. Very well written. Couldn't put it down. Kept me wanting to know what happened next.

B002ZHKZD8|5.0|Jan 2012 received 2 sided \\"flipper\\" disc from Amazon. Blu ray one side, DVD the other. The blu ray side is one of the fastest starting I own. No playing flaws on two different Sony Blu ray players (2010 models). Special features worked great. Played it through a couple of times just to be sure. None of the problems others have expressed here.
B0053B347M|4.0|These bias lighting kits are working well for me.  Make sure your monitor(s) are sitting right in front of a reflective surface, I guess, and that you have a USB plug available relatively nearby to plug it into.  One way they could make them better is if they had an on/off switch, but plugging/unplugging them as needed hasn't been too bad for me (depends on how accessible where you plug it in is).  I used to find my eyes were fatigued easily from staring at the monitor for any more than a couple of hours, and I would use eye drops to relieve some of the bleariness - but with this lightning I have noticed that suddenly I don't seem to need the eye drops, at least very rarely now!
B005XY67WI|3.0|The blu-ray arrived this week.  The concert is spectacular! Shakira's performance is breathtaking!  There are some extras, nothing too long.  The audio sounds good! It comes with DTS-HD Master, LPCM Stereo and Dolby.  The only thing not that good was the video quality: not that realistic, the moving images have a kind of blur. The concert doesn't play on 24p playback, and that makes some difference.  The Oral Fixation Tour blu-ray seems to be superior when it comes to image.  But don't be discouraged to buy it, the show is great! It only didn't get a 5 stars rating because of the missing 24p playback and the not all that good image.

1605981834|5.0|A young college man is dating Dorothy, the daughter of a wealthy copper tycoon, hoping to marry her and eventually inherit her father's money. His plan hits a roadblock when Dorothy tells him that she's pregnant and they must marry right away. Not only that but her father will disown her for getting pregnant out of wedlock - that means no money for the young man. The only way the man can get out of this predicament is to kill Dorothy. If only that was the end of his problems...<br /><br />A Kiss Before Dying, first published in 1953, is Ira Levin's debut novel. It won the 1954 Edgar Award for Best First Novel. Levin is a master of suspense and this novel does not disappoint. He does not reveal the identity of Dorothy's boyfriend in the first part of the book, referring to him only with pronouns. When Dorothy's sister Ellen goes hunting for her murderer, the reader is right alongside her discovering clues and trying to figure out who the killer is. I was on the edge of my seat and as confused as Ellen about who was the murderer. Even after the identity of the killer is discovered the suspense continues right up until the very end.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version of this book. I thought the narrator, Mauro Hantman, did an excellent job. He was able to convincingly voice all of the characters - from tough as nails Leo Kingship to soft spoken naive Dorothy. I especially loved the voice he gave Gordon Gant.<br /><br />I highly recommend A Kiss Before Dying.

B004C5M282|5.0|Quickly has become one of my favorite bands around.  They hit such a variety of rock themes and styles in one cd that you wouldn't think it possible to blend it in one easy package that satisfies all your rock needs, but that is exactly what it does.  If you haven't heard them before, this is an amazing album to check out.  Listen to it with an open mind, don't assume anything, and enjoy the results, you'll love it!

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is everything I wanted in John Green's new book and more. Whether you're a die hard nerdfighter (the name given to Green's fans), or just looking for a great new book to read, this is a fantastic choice. I was alternately laughing and crying throughout the novel; it made me feel at times warm, at times uncomfortable, and always drawn into the truth of the situation. Green's uncomplicated prose moves the reader swiftly through the work, only then to be stopped dead by the simple beauty of a truth nestled seamlessly into the story. (A few times I was staggered enough to put the book down and consider the logistics of inscribing some particularly beautiful statement onto a plaque, poster, or perhaps even tattooing it upon myself.) In short, The Fault in Our Stars is heartbreaking, beautiful, funny, and John Green at his best.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really fun, but realllly addictive! i probably wasted more than 2 hours at once playing it....so yeah...it's super fun, but not when u have stuff to do

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My Kindle Fire owes the Lightweight Microshell Folio Cover its life 3 times over. I'm a middle school student (YES, I KNOW IM YOUNG TO HAVE AN AMAZON ACCOUNT THANK YOU) and I tend to read on my Kindle Fire a lot (and play :D) and so I walk around with it a lot. On three different occasions I have dropped my kindle while standing onto the hard asphalt. Every time I'd hear that heartbreaking smack as it hits the ground. It always sounds like my kindle did not make it. But whenever I pick it up and take of the cover, everything is fine and in working order. THERE WASN'T EVEN A SINGLE SCRATCH :O Of course though the downside is that the rubber around the case did get scraped a little but it was all good, still usable. So in all this is a great product and can protect your kindle against any minor bumps or drops (I wouldnt go all the way up the Eiffel Tower just to test it out) but one warning: It is not a great idea to get the white one because even though it looks pretty you can easily stain it (mine is full of pencil and ink smudges left by my school stuff) and it gets hard to clean.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The most agreeable thing Stephanie Meyer has ever written is on the back cover: \\"The Hunger Games is amazing.\\" Meyer's endorsement blows my mind, because, let's face it, the Twilight series boils down to an infatuated romance between a lonely, naive teenager and an impossibly good guy centenarian. Now I'm sure Meyer would say Twilight is a romantic fantasy about eternal love and sacrifice. Just like Romeo and Juliet. If Romeo was 35.  The Hunger Games is the exact opposite of that nonsense. The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that Suzanne Collins is a genius who read Twilight, was appalled, and decided to write the exact opposite book. The Hunger Games has strong, self reliant and responsible characters who make...reasoned decisions. These characters are defined primary through their talents and actions, not by their attractiveness. Yeah, they are universally good looking, but it seems like more of a coincidence than a requirement. The romance is realistic. The plot is constantly engaging. The Hunger games is readable, thought provoking, and ultimately provides positive role models for its target audience. It is a great book.  One last thing that makes me even more impressed with Collins. She makes several criticisms of American society for a book with such broad appeal. The \\"Capitol\\" is trifling and resource hogging, contrasting the underpaid and overworked residents in the Districts. Suzanne doesn't say exactly what each District produces, but I'm pretty sure one of them makes iPads.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Sandra Bullock nails her role in this movie.  She becomes the feisty character of Leigh Ann with an overwhelming mother's heart and a pragmatic kick your butt mentality.<br />Based on the true life story of Michael Oher and his neglected life of a drug addicted mother and his homeless state as a teenager.  She bullies him into the car, refusing to let him sleep on the streets and soon the family has pulled Michael in.  Once he indicates an interest in Football, Leigh Ann stands by and pushes him in the direction of incredible success.<br />Very few movies have touched me the way that this one has.  I especially like the pictures at the end of the movie of the real Michael Ohr and his incredibly lovely family.  It brings it all home!
B001R4METS|2.0|This is not Foxtrot. Selling England by the Pound or the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, I am a Gabriel fan not Genesis. Gabriel with Genesis created some of his most remarkable material vocal range wise. There are inklings of that on Nursery Cryme especially with Musical Box but not much. The album is interesting in showcasing the inadeqaucies of Genesis even with Peter Gabriel. The Genesis Live cd with Gabriel is much better but this one has interest to those music historians interested in progression of artists. It is amazing that the phenomenal Foxtrot followed this sophormoric work and then the masterpiece Selling England BY the Pound followed by an underwritten classic The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. A dj friend of mine used to assert that Lamb was probably the first issuing in of the punk rock era as we knew it. I would always counterattack with the Stooges and Iggy Pop, the counter-comment was 'I mean intelligent punk rock, new wave.'
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is awesome I would recommend purchasing it has many fun games in it that you may buy with points
B005ELZKWS|5.0|What a concept: writing good songs. Too bad VH never got that memo before they churned our a Different Kind of Turd<br />Chickenfoot got the memo. There is killer music here, which is not even debatable and Satriani sounds just plain cool in most of the parts especially all these chunky Keith Richards riffs he seems to roll out. Then he whips into a lead like only Satch can do. Very cool stuff.<br />Michael Anthony is more out front on this disc and he should be. Again, the VH record suffers without him, this one benefits tremendously by having him on it.<br />Hagar's voice is still excellent and he still writes a decent melody unlike 'mumble with rocks in his mouth-Roth'.<br /><br />Anyway, Bigfoot is awesome, Alright alright, Dubai Blues is cool, Lighten Up, Up next, there is just some well written catchy music being played here by guys that are having fun together and it sounds like it. One of the best things you can pick up this year if you want some good rock!
B006W0QOF2|3.0|Ugh, this movie...  It's weird to try and write a critical review of Drive because soooo many people respond soooo strongly to it.  And, despite what little enjoyment I got out of it, I'm going to have to recommend it.  Because my opinion is so deep in the minority.  Christ, this thing's got a Rotten Tomatoes rating nearly as high as the Godfather...  So, yeah, see Drive, I'm sure you'll love it.  At it's heart, Drive is a contradiction.  The script is pulled right from late 70's, early 80's action flicks - it's got a very simplistic plot, very simplistic characters (flawless hero?  check.  trophy girl?  check.  muscle villain and brain villain?  check.  wormy sidekick?  check-twice actually!) and was the type of thing that used to get made to showcase awesome spectacle while being stupid fun.  But Drive is also a very modern, slowly paced, art-house film with unique (and weird) visuals, brutal violence, and a downright oppresive soundtrack (I get it, he's a 'real hero, a real human being', turn the music off already).  So what we're left with is an action flick that is just no fun at all.  The tone is so heavy and the violence so brutal and punctuated that the simplistic elements of the script feel hard to swallow.  We don't question Clint Eastwoods man with no name character being good at violence, because everyone in those movies is good at violence and he's just slightly better because he's the good guy and he rules.  But why the hell is this nameless 'Driver', who pointedly doesn't carry a gun and does nothing but drive cars well, so good and efficient at killing?  How come the first (and best) driving scene involves him carefully avoiding the police with skill and subterfuge and the second (and silliest) has him swerving around in broad daylight at high speeds in a world where highway patrol doesn't even seem to exist?  These internal contradictions, not of logic but of STYLE, kept taking me out and would not let me enjoy this movie that seemed to be written for enjoyement but filmed for artistic fulfillment and to make some kind of point about violence.  ...that it's bad?  I'm not sure.  Sometimes it's bad, but sometimes it's awesome?  By the way: tangent - the scene in the strip club is amazing and among the best pieces of a movie I've seen in years (and not because fo the nudity, though that never hurts).  It's fluidly paced, the violence is simple and honest and not ridiculous like in the rest of the film, and we see more character there than almost anywhere else.  It's a brilliant, brilliant scene.  Moving on, I'd like to come to the crux of the movie and why, I think, many people love it and I do not.  Ladies and gentlemen... Mr. Ryan Goseling.  Goseling's talent in the past has been creating specific, unique, emotionally available characters... which is not at all why he's in this movie.  He's in this movie because he's popular right now and because he's gorgeous.  Ten years ago, this movie would have starred Brad Pitt.  Ten years before that, Patrick Swayze.  Before that, Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, et al.  He's the chin du jour, the GQ man of the hour.  It doesn't hurt that he's a good actor, but here he's being used as a blatant 'blank slate' for the audience to project themselves upon.  In the very first scene he's painted as super awesome, super efficient, flawless and nearly invincible - yet he has nearly no facial expression and no real opinions on anything (so you can inject your own).  Guys instantly want to be him. In the second scene, in the grocery store, we see him be meak and awkward around people - especially women (still no real expressions or opinions, again, to not get in the way of the audience injecting their own).  The ladies in the audience instantly imagine themselves as the only person to truly appreciate him, and they want to wrap him up and take him home because no one will ever understand him like they do and blah, blah, blah, sweaty sex fantasy.  (I'm making gender generalizations here,and I apologize.  It's just faster.)  I could go on for hours about how these two character types don't exist in the same person outside of BS action movies, but it really doesn't matter.  Drive has just delivered the protagonist one-two punch: turned an attactive and popular masturbation fantasy actor into a (potentialy) univerally acceptable blank slate character.  If the movie has you emulating with a character you've created in your own head, you're going the have a good time.  The next 90 minutes just need to be interesting to look at and marginally cohesive.  Which, in all fairness, they are.  And this is where Drive failed to grasp me.  I had no interest in projecting anything on the Driver character.  I wanted to see an interesting character study, because the opening scene let me know I wasn't getting a mindless action flick (which, again, is fine - that opening heist scene is amazing).  But I don't get that either... so what do I get?  A mediocre flick with good visuals and modest performances that's neither fun nor thought provoking, but one that everyone around me will say is brilliant and unique and timeless and blah blah blah sweaty sex fantasy.  It's not a bad movie, not by any stretch.  But I have a hard time swallowing it as something special.  But, yeah, see Drive.  Everyone else likes it and you probably will too.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|Roman Polanski has made some stinkers in his day, but this 2010 release is not one of them. It's a good suspense film that never goes over the top, and that's a good thing. There's no gory violence to speak of, and mercifully, no car chase to attempt to liven things us. Instead, we get a sort of intellectual thriller in which a writer finds clues to lead hm to think something is rotten in Denmark with the former British prime minister whose boring memoir he has been hired to spice up. There are no real jolts in the twists, and the ending is poetic, not false, as some have charged. I also liked the spare soundtrack.

0143117009|2.0|The first half of the book has some interesting historical and archaeological information about Easter Island, Greenland, the Maya, and the pre-columbian American Southwest. If the author had stopped there I would have given it 4 stars. The second half is the author's diatribe about all the terrible things modern societies are doing to the planet yadda yadda yadda. You've heard it all before. His buggabear is deforestation. Legitimate, perhaps, but if I want to read opinion pieces I disagree with, I'll read the NY Times. Still, the first half - except the first chapter on Montana - is a good read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It has a lot of good options to choose how you like to play most. They have a lot of cool designs for backgrounds and card decks that can totally let you customize how you like it.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I was concerned by a few of the early bad reviews, but this product provides a very sturdy case to protect the Fire when putting it in a purse, briefcase, or other bag.  Some mentioned that the stand feature did not work, but may have gotten better after repeated use.  Mine worked as intended straight out of the packaging.  Best yet, the product adds very little bulk to the Fire, which is exactly what I wanted.

B006UG90RM|4.0|As compared to other VH albums, this is better than \\"Women and Children First\\", \\"Balance\\", and \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\", but not as good as the others. As a rock album in generel, 4 stars. Great musicianship, DLR sounds aged but very good, and the energy and effort of everyone is high throughout. Eddie sounds surprisingly agile. Some standout tracks for me are \\"Blood and Fire\\" (classic), \\"Stay Frosty\\", \\"Big River\\", and \\"Beats Workin'\\", The rest are good to very good, with the exception of \\"Outta Space\\" which still hasn't grown on me. If you have no expectations but have missed VH, you'll love it. If your expecting \\"1984\\" or \\"5150\\", you'll be disappointed.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I was very much looking forward to reading this novel.  Not only am I a fan of near-future dystopian settings, but I also enjoy a bit of teen angst; it does not turn me off in the slightest.  That being said, it simply is not that good.  It is serviceable: the characters are generally well-thought out, setting descriptors are nicely outlined, and it appears that MOST of the constructed world was developed ahead of time.  However, every component of the novel is not only predictable, it is formulaic and uninteresting.  From the standard \\"wining and dining\\" of the tributes, to the parades, to the sponsor evaluations, everything was given its 10 pages of filler.  The other tributes were stereotypical and their generation seemed forced, with only Rue being more than a placeholder (in my opinion).  But even that was better than the actual 74th Games:  the entire battleground was difficult to envision, the novel elements (like the sponsor gifts and fireballs) were unbelievable and reeked of a desperate author attempting to make her novel interesting (aka very poorly done), and the fights were hackneyed and pedestrian in every sense.  I was thoroughly disappointed, enough that I am unlikely to bother with the sequel.  Even Divergent by Veronica Roth was better than this.  Due to its target audience, I am not reducing this to a 2 star review: it is an average tween novel that is professionally written.  Ms. Collins tried and has been more than well rewarded for her efforts.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Eddie is back in full force - NO DOUBT !!! about it !!! Roth is back very respectfully !!! How about a shout out to Alex the most underrated drummer there is . He is beating the drums hard as hell with incredible precision the whole time . I can't help to focus on Alex especiallly in the start of Beats Workin - Making John Bonham PROUD !!! Van Halen ?!!! FOREVER !!! I have been sooooo sick of RAP (no talent Rap), R&B & there hijacking of Music Award Shows over a decade !!! I will start watchin them again if Van Halen is there !!! Roth is the reason Van Halen is Van Halen !!! They were called Mammoth when Gene Simmons dicovered them in 1976 . They found out when they got a recording contract in 1977 another band was already called Mammoth . Roth told EVH when they were thinking of a new name that they should use Van Halen as the name.EVH said NO & was totally against it . He later warmed up to it & changed his mind - THANKFULLY !!! The REST is history !!!!!
0316056863|4.0|A great psuedo-biography, but it's true that it's a bit reluctant and not very personal. But as always, hysterical. If you're looking for more personal/serious, I'd go with something else. Also, this book is really short. Still, definitely worth it.

You learn about types of cancers, early chemotherapy and how it developed, the amazing day that it worked for some people, a lot about the personalities of the researchers and the dynamics of politics, science, and personality.<br /><br />Long, takes a lot of time, especially as an audio book. You need to like to learn. You also need to not fear reading about this terrifying subject.

1609611543|2.0|Although I found the information in this book intriguing (especially how wheat has been altered in the last 50 years to make it higher yielding and impervious to disease/pests,) and it was a fairly quick read, Davis really over and/or misstates some of his findings.  If one believed his statements, then everything from cancer to Alzheimer's to autism to strokes are entirely and solely due to the consumption of wheat - if such were true, given the amount of wheat eaten in this country, EVERYONE would be on death's doorstep strictly from ingesting this one ingredient.  But he begins from two rather erroneous assumptions/findings, to wit: 1. he himself states that less than 1% of the populace have reactions to wheat, and of those only a minority will go on to have serious complications like celiac disease.  For the other 99% of us, although over-reliance on wheat may not be great for the waistline, having wheat and gluten in the diet is far less of a problem than overly processed food, sugar, HFCS, etc.  I suggest it is not the wheat alone that might be causing weight gain, but the sugar, fat and other 'bad' stuff that goes into those foods that ALSO contain wheat: cookies, cakes, bagels, etc.  2. His hysteria over the glycemic index of wheat does not take into account that one rarely eats wheat alone - and if you put butter, peanut butter, meats, or ANY other food WITH the bread, that will alter and generally LOWER the glycemic property of the bread alone - so ALL of his arguments about such are specious.  Early in the book, Davis compares eating 'franken-wheat', which caused him to have some bad reactions, to the ancient and unaltered Einkorn wheat that was the standard 50 years ago - to which he had NO reaction.  Doesn't this suggest that other than doing away with wheat entirely, one should just seek out pure unadulterated wheat and make one's own bread? (Einkorn is easy to find, although somewhat pricey). That's what I did.  Aside from these faults, the book really has very few recipes (some of which I tried and were... ummm... pretty disgusting), or as others have noted, suggestions on how to make due without wheat - it is really just the Paleo/Atkins diets rehashed.  I recently went without wheat/gluten for 2 months as I was a test subject for another diet plan (http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Sugar-Solution-UltraHealthy-Preventing/dp/031612737X/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1328905784&sr=8-1-spell) and did drop 20 lbs and improved my blood sugar numbers, etc.  Going without wheat was initially a bit daunting, but I had none of the 'withdrawal' symptoms or the intense cravings that Davis insists will occur.  HOWEVER, when I re-introduced wheat back into my diet, not only did I have absolutely no adverse symptoms, but because I was NOT using any processed foods, I also experienced NO WEIGHT GAIN.  Recently I also read a study (from Dr. Oz's blog, I believe) that put a group of people on two diet plans, the ONLY difference being that one group was allowed bread, the other wasn't.  There was NO significant difference in the amount of weight lost; however, those allowed bread were able to stick to the diet far more successfully than those who were denied, many of whom dropped out.  I think all of this goes to say that SOME (few) people may indeed do better without wheat, but not everyone needs or should avoid it entirely - it is not the 'boogie-man' that Davis proposes. And rather than eliminate wheat for weight loss, perhaps it would be more effective to eat unprocessed, whole fresh food and eliminate those foods that we all know will cause ballooning waistlines.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I don't know what the gripe is...this game works great ony tablet and has great graphics that are clear and not pixelated. Tho this is not HD so the graphics are not super crisp looking but it plays like your watching a cartoon on tv. It runs smooth with no lag or glitches. I love this game! It's my favorite and I am glad that I ignored some of the negative reviews because it looks and runs awsome on my A1!

B0061TQBRK|5.0|This is my favorite band ever, so I am biased, but if you liked the bands' earlier sound then you will like this album. I liked 'shallow life' but i wouldn't have loved the band if it was their only sound.  If you are unfamiliar with Lacuna Coil, the best way I can describe them is Evanescence but harder.  Cristinas' wonderful voice offset with Andreas' hard male vocals, coupled with the outstanding lyrics on so many of their songs, is nothing short of awesome.  This band is one of the best live also, so if you get the chance, see them. They all are very friendly and good people with a genuine desire to be great at what they do, and have appreciation for their fans.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|Imagine Van Halen's first album was supposed to be a double album, but the second half was shelved.  This is that second half as interpreted by a wizened Van Halen and produced with today's amazing recording equipment.  Van Halen fans will be satisfied. . . I guess we won't talk about the massive knife still sticking out of Michael Anthony's back.
0553582038|2.0|(spoilers in this review)  Like many of the reviewers here, I don't review George RR Martin's website and I had no idea going in to FFC that my three favorite characters would be completely missing.  I didn't even flip ahead to see the chapter names.  I just kept hoping Tyrion would finally appear, or that we would finally get back into the Dany storyline.  That we would be transported back to the wall as the Others creep closer to Westeros.  Instead, I was constantly infuriated as the chapter name \\"Cersei\\" kept popping up, over and over again.  Before I finished the book (and read GRRM's \\"meanwhile...\\" statement), I felt as if GRRM was typing this story one-handed, so as to flip us all the bird with the other.  And not just on account of the missing characters.  One thing nobody seems to mention is that we have not only invested ourselves in many of these characters, but we are also rooting for their success.  Certainly a shocking death of a beloved character is thrilling now and again, but he seems to have made it the rule, rather than the exception.  I read GOT right after seeing the amazing HBO series, and I devoured the next three one after the other.  I was hoping that in Book 2, we would see some of our characters reuniting.  After all, GOT so devastatingly tore the family at the center of the story apart, I looked forward to the day at least some of these siblings would see each other again.  But no.  Not in book two.  Or three.  Or four.  GRRM keeps them apart (and despairing that the others are dead), and cheats them at every turn by almost reuniting them and then pummeling them even further.  Bran almost reunites with Jon, but is yanked onto a horse by someone named Cold Hands.  Arya, after dozens of difficult trials, comes within meters of reuniting with her mother and brother, only to have them murdered and be yanked away by the Hound.  She doesn't even get to reunite with her dang direwolf before shipping off to Braavos (where she has apparently becomeblind, so even if she reunites with her siblings, she'll never truly \\"see\\" them again - aargh).  In this novel, we have Brienne slowly tromping all over the Riverlands - always in the wrong direction, and we can't even get a successful quest there - but we do get to see good Podrick hanged for all his help and goodness to both Brienne and Tyrion were worth.  It would have been nice to read about the emotions Sansa would have experienced upon learning that her sister is alive (as opposed to developing a creepy relationship with the annoying Robert Arryn and then another creepy pedophilic relationship with Littlefinger). And Catelyn, the mother despairing over the loss of her entire family - instead of learning any of them are alive, she becomes an undead witch(???) and hangs the good guys.  I do like that this fantasy series is more grounded in the reality that bad things happen to good people.  But in reality, good things happen to them, too.  And as a reader, I like to feel GOOD every now and again.  Am I wrong here?  Are we not tearing through these novels hoping we'll reach a chapter where something good happens to Arya, Sansa, Jon, Tyrion, etc.?  I am already despairing that Dance with Dragons will be a let-down (I am hearing snippets of hate on that one through these reviews).  I am holding out hope that if the HBO series makes it this far, they will somehow combine the two books together and make an actual story.  This book really had no story, and the only major thing set in motion seems to be the addition of religious warriors (who seemed to have magically populated Westeros almost immediately after Cersei made her decision, yet it took Brienne how long to make it through the Riverlands?  I am all over the place here, but in a nutshell, I am disappointed and I want GRRM to throw a few happy endings our way already.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I Really enjoy playing this game.  Great experience. I have played other solitaire games and this one is the easiest to play and understand.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|After finishing the Hunger Games, I immediately went out the next day and bought Catching Fire and Mockingjay. I was disappointed by both, but most of all with Mockingjay. Another review stated that it's depressing to see the world through hollow and lifeless eyes - and I completely agree. I felt like the book was written hurriedly, although it dragged until the very end. The topics felt exhausted and forced, and overall I thought it was a 180 from The Hunger Games.  Katniss doesn't have any fight in her at the beginning, which I can understand. She is depressed and feels isolated emotionally from her experiences. But you just drag through her stubborn, mundane motions while everyone else tries to rally. Gale is mentioned here and there, but you can never figure out her emotions towards anything besides her anger at the Capitol- and even those motions aren't strong enough to get her to do anything besides mope all day. You're never able to figure out who she loves and most of the time it seems like no one, except for when Collins remembers to throw Prim in the story here and there. When it comes to the love side of the story, at the end when she chooses Peeta, you find yourself asking WHY? Katniss never displays any love for him. Concern sometimes, loneliness without him, but nothing that warrants marriage and children. I felt like Peeta's sweet, unwavering loyalty and love for Katniss is undeserved by her. She's mopey, depressing, and too damn hard to understand- and I don't think Collins made her that way on purpose. It just feels like a horrible lack of character development. The \\"love triangle\\" feels more like a twisted circle with two sweet, nice guys who are just constantly walked over by Katniss in her indecision.  Overall, I ended up rushing through Mockingjay to be horribly disappointed. I almost didn't even finish it except I wanted to find out which poor guy was the \\"lucky\\" one. I reread the Hunger Games to reassure myself that Collins does have excellentwriting in her and that at least one of her three books was a success.

B00006JL1Z|1.0|I purchased the 2 CD package, and discovered that the songs on disc 1 are bundled up inside a proprietary exe file.  You can't play the 1st disc in your car stereo or CD player.  You need to use a computer.  When you run the exe file, a screen appears and plays the songs in a predetermined order.  There is no volume control on the screen, so you have to use the one built inside Windows.  Worse, you cannot select an individual song or a group of songs, and you have no control over the way the songs are played.  It's like listening to them over the radio.  (The songs on disc 2 are ok.  They are stored separately.  Note, that the songs on the disc 2 are the same ones you hear when purchasing the single CD.)  If you open disc 1 using Windows Media Player, you can choose which songs to play on disc 2, but you cannot change the play order, and you cannot create a play list.  They labeled this 2 CD pack \\"Enhanced\\", but \\"Crippled\\" better describes it.

B000055Y0X|5.0|...that this madness is over and that no paranoid politicians and insane military leaders can lead us into oblivion?<br />Kubrick's black comedy of 1964 about the cold war and the arms race is only 'outdated' at first glance. Ok, the cold war is over, most of it. Arms races are temporarily on hold, until further notice (after all, the opponents of deficit spending will never oppose a proper military budget, will they). But: just listen to insane General Jack D. Ripper's conspiracy theory about fluoride additives, or to General Turgidson's ravings about armament gaps in comparison to the Commies, and you will rather easily recognize their various contemporary brothers in arms. Either of them would stand a chance to win the reptiliannomination.<br /><br />By the way, there is a frequent misconception that Peter Sellers plays the madman in this film. Not so. Sellers plays some of the rational people here (the RAF officer who tries to stop the Ripper, and the President). He also plays the clown, Strangelove, Merkwuerdigliebe, an amalgam of all hijacked Nazi scientists. He is just crazy. Harmless.<br />Brilliant acting by Sellers in his 3 parts, and by George C.Scott as Turgidson (who is said to have been unhappy with his character.)<br />Worth a repeat visit.
0062082353|1.0|This is probably one of the worst books I ever read. Poorly written and writer is very selfish, without deep knowledge about war or wat really happened there. It is like he wrote the book from seeing a movie. It is that bad that I dont know where to start. Dont waist your time to read it.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Lots of happy Fire owners have endorsed this app, so I was eager to try it.  Very disappointed.  No manual available for Fire users yet, or so I'm told.  But then, Mobile Systems CS has given me incorrect or incomplete advice several times this week.  Yes, their turn-aound is prompt and their apology and revised/corrected answers are sincere, but the problems keeps recurring.<br /><br />Seems like the app was created for drag-and-drop mousie input and the touch screen work-arounds are overly devious.  Have returned this app for refund; still awaiting a good Fire word processor.

1594203059|4.0|This book is not the Bible or the Gospels of the 21st century. To say so would be a lie, but it sure is the aprocryphal Thorah as it could emerge from The Book of Revelation. It proposes both debatable historical patterns that the author turns into laws, and an apocalyptic prediction of the end of civilization in the global confrontation between and among all civilizations. He may hopes that would not happen.<br /><br />From beginning to end he will irritate you with a propensity to generalize his west-oriented observations into predictions of the future that are nothing but negative projections of his own mental patterns. But I will not harp too long on his biased color but let me shift to the more positive.<br /><br />First and foremost it is absurd to defend a reified if not deified, definitely fetishized civilization founded on so-called universal principles that are nothing but the principles the winning powers in 1945 considered as universal and sanctified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. These were the rights the West and only the West imposed - after their victory over Germany, Italy and Japan - to the whole world as expressed mostly in the constitutions of the western countries that had a constitution, or eventually a Bill of Rights. We must keep in mind that this brilliant generalization of western principles was the result of two world wars, fifty million casualties in the second in five years, the development of industrial genocide, the barbaric terrorizing and killing of civilian populations in Dresden, Hamburg, Hiroshima, Nagasaki and a few other places like that. I do not forget nor underestimate Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Dachau, Ravensbr&uuml;ck and all other concentration camps, plus Stalingrad, the Warsaw Ghetto and the gulag, plus a few other systematic repressive and cleansing killing of broad categories of people discriminated in their ethnic origins, religions, languages, political ideas, or whatever may have pleased the leaders of the time and their apparatchiks.<br /><br />Then  Niall Ferguson is trying, and only trying, to be an historian and he sees six \\"killing apps\\", i.e. six forces that produced the West.<br />1- Competition (political, national, commercial...);<br />2- The scientific revolution (and he forgets the necessary loosening of the fundamentalist Christian vice that controlled minds and bodies up to Gutenberg's invention, and even beyond);<br />3- The rule of law and representative government (and he forgets to insist it took five centuries to finally get to universal ballot and thus real representation);<br />4- Modern Medicine (and it only really started four centuries after the beginning of that West);<br />5- Consumer society (and that took five centuries to emerge);<br />6- The work ethic (that he basically casts in the sole protestant ethics of the Lutheran and Calvinist Reformation, and very little else).<br /><br />His demonstration is a circular one. And he does not take the six killing apps in a global and common historical frame, but rather take each one separately, which enables him to forget they appeared one at a time over a period of five to six centuries; That also enables him to forget what had occurred before, the very history of the emergence of each one of these applications.<br /><br />Each of the possible challenging civilizations, the Moslem empire, the Ottaman empire and the Chinese empire, are shown as failing because they don't demonstrate generally one or two of these killing apps the West used to succeed. He forgets that since for instance the ballot was really invented at the end of the 18th century in the US Constitution and on a very limited  basis, the West should have failed. Since The West did not have any industrial revolution before the mid-18th century, the west should have failed. Since religion has slowly disappeared from the west, starting with the religious wars and the Enlightenment in the 18th century, and since it only survivesin the US as some kind of Sunday entertainment and TV variety shows, not to speak of funeral social events, the West should be failing right now. He does not of course foresee that possibility of such a future, though he apocalyptically evokes the end of the West and its falling over the brink in the space of one generation. But this is only the spectre he brandishes to reinforce his own prediction.<br /><br />What he does not see is that up to the mid-20th century, or even the end of it, if empires have systematically followed the pattern of being born, prospering, decaying and dying, and we could discuss every single element in this pattern, there is no historical reason to believe it will be the same with the US and China, since the present conditions are in no way comparable to what they might have been before. If he had spoken of market economy instead of capitalism and consumer society, he may have understood that for the first time ever in human history the vast majority of if not the whole world are unified at that level. And that's only a question of size here since market economy has existed as soon as Homo Sapiens had something to trade, strating with procreators both male and female. Today this market economy is not making two empires built on different principles live together in some peaceful coexistence, but it is bringing the whole global market economy of the whole world up to possible general principles that would have to be seen as flexible, adaptable and progressively evolutionary. There will never be a final point in that construction of these general principles that cannot be seen as universal.<br /><br />If we accept that debatable pattern or law of birth-growth-decay-death, then we only reify, deify and fetishize an observation. There is no reason for that cycle to be anything else but an ideology, then there are myriads of reasons for the future to be different, for human global behaviour not to be the same as that of a time when there was no globality in any empire. Today we have a global situation, the principles are different, dictators or autocrats are ousted and brought to trial, genocides are followed by international trials against the genocidal leaders, etc. The last imperialistic war was in Iraq. Even Libya was not an imperialistic intervention. Coercion seems to be a political governing principle that is waning out.<br /><br />So he could have maybe developed some alternative ideas. Let me suggest a few.<br /><br />1- The Christian religion was more a brake than an accelerator, though it was both. The work ethic does not come so much from religion than from the survival instinct boosted by the recognition of the individual. This recognition was worked within the Christian context but it is in fact already contained in feudalism that recognizes the value of the chattel of a territory, and that chattel includes the serfs who are human beings, with a soul, recognized and protected by the church and the law: The Peace of God or Peace of the King movement starting in the 10th century with important demonstrations, called pilgrimages or gatherings, summoned by the archbishops and bishops of Aurillac, Le Puy, Clermont (today Clermont-Ferrand) and Poitiers, imposed some limits for warlike activities among Christian barons or kings. The same movement imposed the respect of Sundays and holidays as non-working days. If you do not work on some days, then the work you perform on the other days is magnified: it is the daily work from angelus to angelus that is dedicated to God in order to be able to serve God properly and the people He has appointed on earth. If anything, the Reformation is a movement back to these already old ideas that suffered a lot due to the Black Death and the 100 Years War, among others.<br /><br />2- He should have studied Buddhism, which is extremely strong in China or Japan, and the whole of South East Asia. Buddhism is the recognition that the future of each individual is his or hers, that all men and women are equal in front of the choice to get on the path of enlightenment that can only come from him or her. What's more each individual, including the monks, is supposed to be beneficial to their society and if successful over the average to share the fruits of that success with the others who they also have to help get on the path of enlightenment with education, religious practice, health care and inspiration. After 1945, within the small vehicle of Buddhism a deep reflection has been carried out on work, the market economy, the need to support and moralize this market economy with social and ethical principles that at times even lead some Buddhist thinkers to referring to Buddha as a socialist thinker, or even a revolutionary. Buddhism is not contemplative. It is a vision of personal improvement and action with and for others. Ferguson ignored all that.<br /><br />3- Ferguson is a very conservative thinker perfectly comparable in his mental functioning to Ron Hubbard or some others along such lines. He is founding his whole vision on the principle of birth-life-death, hence on the only principle of survival with inescapable death. Hubbard imagined in his great metaphysical delirium the possibility of immortality. Ferguson avoids that ridiculous hypothesis, though Ray Kurzweil comes close to it, but locks himself in a cyclical mental pattern. If the sole instinct of survival had been the Homo Sapiens principle Homo Sapiens would never have conquered the world in the first place. He would be a small animal species in Eastern Africa and we would not be here to see it. The basic principle should be development.<br />a- Personal development (psychological, moral, cultural);<br />b- Empathetic development: the slow emergence of love and emotions in the place of the dyad libido-death-instinct that only leads to using the other. We have just reached the moment when that empathy can be successful.<br />c- Relational development that is the consequence of the previous one based on the recognition of the other(s) as being our equal(s) and as worthy of our establishing with them relations that lead to a political, social, cultural system of individuals contracted together.<br />d- Social development is the consequence of this  and it started with Homo Sapiens who invented some at least 250,000 years ago the division of labor, the mapping of various activities on the living space of the group, the systematic understanding that survival and development could only come from and through the organized group. And that required/requires language.<br />e- Finally human development states that man is an organism that has to develop to reach their objectives: intellectual, mental, psychological, etc. development.<br /><br />That should have brought Ferguson to the idea - along with Winston Churchill he quotes - that the future cannot be bipolar, nor multi-polar either, cannot be the victory of one over the other(s) into mono-polarity, but that it can only be a two-or-multi-headed global organization or equal members. The end of the Cold War was the first step towards that objective and there is a long way still to go.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUors or autocrats are ousted and brought to trial, genocides are followed by international trials against the genocidal leaders, etc. The last imperialistic war was in Iraq.

B003X5UFWW|3.0|A beautiful, if redundant, Chinese martial arts epic set at the onset of the second Sino-Japanese war. The eponymous focal figure Ip Man, drawn straight out of the history books, is the peaceful model of restraint and self-control. His easy smile, passive existence and unmatched skills make him very easy to pull for, especially when a trying second act pushes him past the breaking point, but the flick's deep reverence for his legacy strips away any chances at suspense or tension. Though gorgeously choreographed and filmed, the major fight scenes are universally one-sided, with Ip himself rarely absorbing more than a few glancing blows on his way to flashily disarming and dispensing each opponent. Even his last foe, a towering Japanese army general who effortlessly conquers three of Ip's peers at once, leaves behind little more than a cloud of dust and a disappointed, unspoken \\"is that it?\\" when he quietly takes a knee. Undoubtedly a feast for the eyes, the road it walks is too straight and narrow to be considered anything more substantial.

B001BWQVSG|2.0|What a tragedy that someone with such incredible technical ability has almost no interpretive soul. After the 2nd CD I'd had enough of listening to a pianist who exhibits only a two-dimensional style of training: super \\"forte\\" and extreme \\"presto\\". If you like listening to an agressive human machine pound thru piece after piece hard and fast, rushing to the finish line, then this set is for you. If not, then I suggest you pass, or else at the most buy used as cheap as you can. The 2 stars are for her technical ability.
B00003CXCW|5.0|This is a classic Billy Wilder film; this along with Stalag 17 are a couple of my favorite movies.  William Holder was brilliant in both films.  I've always like this film, but never owned a copy, well I do now and I can watch anytime I want. My 22 year old daughter saw it and loved it, which tells you this movie will hold up for a long time.  I highly recommend you watch this movie.

B000NA28I4|1.0|I need to say up front that I was not impressed by the book.  It's an obvious, contrived heap of cliché, with an intolerable, whiny protagonist, exactly no better or worse than could be expected of a fifteen-year-old would-be author.  I also need to say that I understand that any movie based on a book needs to be cut for length and then amended accordingly so that it makes sense with the cuts.  After that, I have to say that I'm flabbergasted.  Many choices were made during the process of adaptation that I can only describe as bizarre.  We could have been given a growing-up montage for Saphira, but instead she flies up into a cloud and... magic happens, I guess.  Urgals are apparently sweaty humans who wear eyeliner and wield Klingon battle-axes.  Most of the dialogue is just *weird* and even Jeremy Irons manages to be boring.  For the first half-hour or so I found myself enjoying it as a hilariously awful movie, but after that it just became tedious.  Skip it and watch \\"Reign of Fire\\" instead.
0439023521|5.0|This is a wonderful, exciting book. It keeps you hungry for more!! It will keep you on the edge of your seat. The best thing to do is order all three at one time, so you can finish what you start! I want to see the movie now!
B004KD5TQI|5.0|So good your eyes will roll back in your head.  I haven't been this excited about a movie soundtrack in years.  I suspect this is because most of these songs are already favorites of mine in their original versions.  The cover are actually *good* though, which is usually not the case.
B004SIP7AS|4.0|This is an EMMA to own.  Very solid cast working from a great script. Paltrow is outstanding! Alan Cumming, Jeremy Northam, Toni Collette, Sophie Thompson (oh, BRAVO! Sophie )give this version a thoroughly solid, professional cast.  Some prefer the Kate Beckinsale EMMA, and She is good, but it's a crummy script, with the Frank Churchill part vastly expanded, a churlish, cranky Knightly, and the comic relief - The Elton's - aren't very funny, just one dimensional cartoons. PLUS the tacked on ending, A THREE COUPLES SET DANCE AT A HARVEST FESTIVAL, IS NOTHING AUSTEN EVER WROTE!!! Romantic twaddle, better suited to bodice rippers on sale at your local grocery store.  Paltrow had the good sense - or the luck - to work with a much better supporting cast, with a MUCH better script. The Art Direction - costumes, sets, lighting, especially the lighting - is also superb.

B0038LB3YK|2.0|Gripping. Might be. Teenager coincidences (is any american trauma left out?). Naive. But one of the worst characters is a member of opus dei? I read that it took several years to the author to prepare this book, which makes me hesitate even more about the author or the editor. I know people who join the opus dei, and they can be nice or stupid, but there's no place for mafia and CIA members, cold-blooded killers. Maybe in 80 years there is, but not now. So I couldn't buy it any more. By the way, not a single word in Spanish is spelled correctly.

B005QJZ5FA|2.0|Not many would dispute that Lana Del Rey is both beautiful and has a distinct voice.  \\"Video Games,\\" the lead single off of Del Rey's anticipated debut effort  Born to Die is nothing short of a `home run.' The problem with [[ASIN:B005QJZ5FA Born To Die]] is as a whole, it ends up being rather dull and uninspiring.  There are sparks of life throughout the effort, but there is so much sameness within the production scheme and with the songwriting that the dull easily eclipses the alluring.  The first five cuts of the album are solid for the most part with \\"Video Game\\" being the standout, but after that, Del Rey's voice not only annoys ever so slightly, but the material is just so dreary to listen to.  The question becomes, was Born to Die rushed to build on the momentum of \\"Video Games\\" or is the songwriting and production just so-so just because? Regardless, Born to Die ends up being a mixed affair.<br /><br />\\"Born to Die\\" opens the effort strongly with strings (a mainstay that stays too long throughout the effort) and tasteful hip-hop oriented drum programming.  Del Rey's vocals are full bodied in her sultry lower register, but there is also a sense that her performance lacks a certain urgency.  Sure, the lower register vocals may be trademark for the singer, but at times they irk the listener ever so slightly as well. The songwriting on the title track is strong.  \\"Off to the Races\\" is off-putting, at least at first.  Del Rey's vocals are mumbled and sang the slightest bit too casually on the verse.  Thankfully, Del Rey ascends into her upper register on the well penned refrain: \\"and I'm off to the races, causes of Bacardi chasers/Chasin' me all over town `cause he knows I'm wasted...\\" The production is well conceived for the most part, namely the vocal production when Del Rey's vocals are harmonized during the second verse.  The biggest adversity of \\"Off to the Races\\" is length, clocking in just shy of five minutes.<br /><br />\\"Blue Jeans\\" finally provides a sensible length, clocking in just shy of three and a half minutes. Unfortunately, the cut is less stellar than either \\"Born to Die\\" or \\"Off to the Races.\\" It is enjoyable enough, but nothing enthralling or particularly exciting. \\"Video Games\\" saves the day with its brilliant though simple harmonic progression.  Del Rey's lower register seems intact and desirable here, more so than on the initial verse of say \\"Off to the Races.\\" The refrain is a songwriting master class, not to mention how electrically Del Rey sings it: \\"It's you, it's you, it's all for you/everything I do/I tell you all the time/Heaven is a place on earth with you/tell me all the things you wanna do...\\" \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\"  doesn't quite eclipse \\"Video Games\\" (not much would), but it is a nice continuation of the momentum set by that cut.  The enthusiastic hip-hop drum programming is smart as are Del Rey's jazzy-indie styled vocals.  The biggest quibble at times might be the steadiness and solidarity of the pitch itself.<br /><br />After \\"Diet Mountain Dew,\\" things generally go south for Del Rey's debut. \\"National Anthem\\" features a solid refrain, but the verse is rather awkward.  The predictability and gargantuan production of the refrain doesn't quite save the rather undercooked songwriting and sound of \\"National Anthem.\\" \\"Dark Paradise\\" is better, though by no means `the second coming.' The mysterious opening to the cut is a nice touch as is the slackening of the tempo from \\"National Anthem.\\" The biggest issue then is Del Rey sleepwalks through the vocal performance, which makes it that much harder for the listener to possibly get into the song.  \\"Radio\\" is a backpedal as well, lacking distinct production and little differentiation.  Not even the `f-bomb' she drops could spark much excitability and that's sad.<br /><br />\\"Carmen\\" is ridiculously boring and \\"Million Dollar Man\\" is better, though nowhere near the league of \\"Video Games\\" or the title cut. \\"Summertime Sadness\\" is really sad, perhaps showing Del Rey's promising debut looking from the depths of the bottom.  \\"This Is What Makes Us Girls\\" has no connection to the audience whatsoever, making it a non-factor.<br /><br />What is there to say? Unfortunately there are more negatives than positives.  Some may dig Del Rey's understated, lazy vocal style, but regardless how you judge Del Rey vocally, the material on [[ASIN:B005QJZ5FA Born To Die]] does the upstart few favors.  For album number two, Del Rey and her producers, which could stand to be mixed up in round two, need to focus on more memorable songwriting and production.  Material really does make a difference.om the depths of the bottom.  \\"This Is What Makes Us Girls\\" has no connection to the audience whatsoever, making it a non-factor.  What is there to say?

I was very upset because the presentation box is what holds these books for their lifetime.  I asked for a new set and a return label and was told that I could have 20% refund and that's it.  I was embarrassed to give this to my sister for her first sons birth.  It made a very special gift a little less special.

1451627289|5.0|Having been a King fan from the very beginning, needless to say I love most of his works. Some fall a little short, and there are a few that I have began, and sad to say, put down, never to attempt to read again. I stopped purchasing his books on the very day of release quite a few years ago. I now wait for the reviews. I had read reviews of this one, and was in my favorite book store on release day. After reading the front flap, I knew I had to buy it. WOW! never would have thought I'd say that any epic was better than The Stand, but THIS IS IT!!! I started reading that evening, and couldn't put it down until I'd finished almost 36 hours later!! In this writing he returned to the Stephen King that I love. He takes the theory of time travel to an entirely different level. It's a love story,it's time travel, as well as a little historical (it's obvious that a tremendous amount of research was done for both the details of the past and the Kennedy assasination).His accuracy of the late fifties and early sixties was wonderful. Being 59, it brought to mind wonderful, childhood memories, and as only King can do, he also revisited a few characters and incidents from previous novels. My advice...only start reading on a weekend when you have no plans, because, you will not want to stop for anything. Thanks Mr. King!!! Please continue to sweep us off our feet as you've done numerous time in the past!!!!
B003L16FAE|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, and whenever a new viewing format comes out, this is one of those titles that I will usually upgrade sometime after they put it out on the new format.  I have been watching this movie since I was in high school, and it's absolutely one of my all time favorites. I was actually fairly impressed with [[ASIN:B0040YFR1Y Predators ( + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]] as well, which I would have to say would be my 2nd favorite Predator movie next to this one.  I wasn't as big a fan of [[ASIN:B001VFM0YW Predator 2 [Blu-ray]]] or necessarily the Alien vs Predator movies, but they were decent I suppose.  Anyway, this will always be one of my absolute favorites, along with the likes of such movies as [[ASIN:B004RE29T0 Alien [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B004RE29PO Aliens [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B001RIY4WE Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition) [Blu-ray]]], and various others.  This is not any kind of spectacular collectors edition Blu-Ray or anything, but it's still cool.
B005K17RU0|4.0|lovesssss it so much.very useful and also free which is pretty sweet too.  :) now I just need two more words
B004RE29PO|5.0|\\"Get away from her you b****!\\"  Haha, classic.  Aliens' predecessor, [[ASIN:B004RE29T0 Alien [Blu-ray]]], was an awesome, groundbreaking movie...which also deserves no less than a 5 star rating, but after it came this movie and even blew the 1st movie out of the water!  This is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best sci-fi action movies ever...in history...period!  Like the 1st movie as well, I this is one of those classic hits that I always upgrade to a new viewing format after it's been release...at least once I have the means of playing said new format, and I was stoked to finally get this and the first Alien movie on Blu-Ray.  The 2 combined, also, make for a great mini marathon.  The 3rd and 4th movies are decently good too, but could in no way compare to the first 2.  There are awesome movies folks, and if you enjoy good sci-fi and have never seen them, you're missing out!  Check them out!
B0064NTZJO|3.0|I enjoy \\"movies\\" and I enjoy \\"film\\" and this manages to harness some of the best qualities of a good movie while having the best AND worst parts of an art film.  Without dragging you through the plot let me just tell you that that despite the car on the front, there is no car chase (minus a short sequence) in the entire film.  What there is, is several scenes of shockingly brutal violence.  But these scenes of violence only set a pace that does not occur for the remainder of the film which tends to be a little more somber and slow.  So it begins with a bang and becomes sad and cerebral afterward.  I did not hate the film but if the jumps in action and violence were paced more thoughtfully with the \\"internal\\" moments, I would say that this would have been a classic rather than a curiosity.
1423101502|5.0|Each book in the Percy Jackson series has been enjoyable, but I'd hafta say that the final book in my opinion is probably the best and most epic of all 5 books! It even surpassed my initial expectations! You couldn't end a series like this in a better fashion. 3 cheers for Rick Riordin! If you like young adult fantasy and haven't read the Percy Jackson series, I highly recommend that you do!
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Adults and kids alike will like this one. Kids and Adults can enjoy this movie together. I was really skeptical about watching it at my age thinking that it would be too young. But it wasn't. Great movie.
B006T5FDLG|4.0|Along with Load through Death Magnetic...the songs on this EP can never compare to Metallica's workings from between Kill Em All and black album, but that does not mean that it isn't good.  Load, Reload, Death Magnetic, etc were all still really good albums, and I enjoyed them, and the songs on this EP are no exception.  Death Magnetic was a great album, probably my favorite since the black album actually, and the extra songs on this EP are just as good in my opinion.  If you're a Metallica fan, this EP is for you!  Buy it!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This was a great movie. I have watched it numerous times over the years.  However, it has the worst screen kiss. This kiss takes place in the final scene, just as the picture ends.  It is between Maureen O'Hara and John Payne.  The first time I saw the movie, when I saw this kiss, I was startled at the way the kiss was acted out. It was to harsh and without finesse, and lacked any romantic appeal for this type of movie. He pressed her mouth so hard, it made lines on the side of her face. It certainly was not the type of kiss that matched this type of movie.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|Great album! Have listened to it non-stop for the past couple of days! I have purchased all of their albums and I can say I wasn't disappointed in this one either. I don't think there's one song on the entire cd I don't like! That's unusual....for any cd!
B006UG90RM|5.0|I love the Hagar years but this new album has me almost forgetting that the Hagar era ever happened...it's that good. I could care less that some of the songs are re-worked songs from the 70's they still sound relevant. Eddie's playing is over the top and his guitar sound is monstrous. It is great to hear and see David Lee Roth back in the band the guy is all about having a good time...he's a living cartoon character. As for Alex well, he sounds bombastic...a fantastic drummer. The only (minor) gripe I have is that although Wolfie is doing a fine job, we waited over 25 years for a classic Van Halen record and it's missing Michael Anthony???...I don't get it. Anyway, this album absolutely exceeded my expectations...after hearing \\"Tattoo\\" I was a bit skeptical. Great to see them back sounding great.
B000003AEB|5.0|This is a classic rap album. I love all of these songs. This is Snoop dogg at his very best.
B004478GNI|4.0|I got this for Christmas when I was separated from my huge LEGO collection back home. Surprisingly, this little set was a lot of fun on its own. The pilot and astromech are both exclusive to this set, which makes it valuable. The wings rotate the proper direction, unlike the previous V-wing starfighter. And it just looks cool in Imperial grey and black.  The wings are held at angles by smooth hinges (not click hings) so if you bump the fighter they can move. This can get irritating if you are picky about the angle of the wings, but for an adult it's no problem.  I probably would not have mustered up the money to buy it myself, but that comes down to personal opinion. This V-wing is just a fun little set.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Marget Thacher is a woman of thinking and action.  Yet this movie is all idle talk and superficial feeling.  This movie is the opposite of who she is.  She was the first woman head of state of an industrialized country.  Yet, most of this movie takes place in the present, long after she has left office, when she is suffering from dementia.  It is so far off the true story that I can not help but see it as a blatant attempt to discredit her.
B005VPRG10|5.0|This set is a piece of art. I was stunned that the wing borders fit on so perfectly, and there is a little piece on the front and back corners of the wing to keep the grey border from sliding off. The struts on the side look amazing and are likewise expertly crafted. The cockpit is not perfectly round but the designers did an admirable job with their choice of LEGO bricks.  I may be the minority, but I also love that it comes with flick-fire missiles. They never get old.  The minifigures are great. The TIE fighter pilot has a face under the helmet, but it's kind of pale since it is printed on a black head. Still fun, though. This is also my first Imperial Officer, which is exciting.  The wings connect to the body a lot better than previous iterations. They don't wobble as much when you're swooshing it around your house, and they don't fall off as easily. The wings are made up of lots of plates, so you have to keep an eye out for pieces coming loose during play, but usually it all holds together well.  The TIE fighter is bigger than I thought. It looks slightly out of scale to both the 6206 TIE Interceptor and 8017 Darth Vader's TIE. But the size of the model makes the price a little easier to swallow.
0316056863|2.0|I am a fan of Tina Fey as a television writer and a comic personna on that medium.  So what a disappointment it was to read this self-indulgent memoir that was not in the least bit funny.  Not even a belly laugh.  Like another gifted comic, Albert Brooks, whose novel was a complete embarrassment, Fey does not come across as funny or even very clever in book form.  I confess, I did not ready the entire book.  I threw it away at the halfway point, regretting my waste of money.  I know this is not the popular opinion, but perhaps this is a book for people who don't read books as a rule.  Tina is funny on TV.  Not here.  The only one who's laughing is Tina, all the way to the bank.
1451648537|2.0|After Steve Job's passed away, I wanted to read about what kind of a person he was as he contributed so many amazing technological advances to our society in his lifetime. Ironically, he chose the author of this book, but the author definitely carries a negative undertone about Steve throughout his book. It was disappointing to learn that Steve Job's was really not a good person and even though he created many amazing devices for us to use, he did so at the emotional expense of others (including his family).  The book itself is very repetitive and does not flow well. It skips around has an abrupt ending. Overall, I was very disappointed. This book could have dissemeninated the same information much more clearly and be about half the size it is.
0062103377|5.0|I DON'T READ. BUT ANYONE THAT WATCHES SUPERNATUAL WILL LOVE THIS BOOK. ITS LIKE LISTENING TO BOBBY TALK ALL THE WAY. ALL MY GOD I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN IT WAS GREAT. MY HUSBAND GOT IT FOR ME FOR CHRISTMAS AND IT WAS SO GOOD. A MUST GET BOOK.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This cover is perfect for my Fire. It fits inside like a glove. I also like the elastic strap that holds it together. The only draw back is the fold-over part doesn't quite fit the slot on the back, so it has a hard time staying propped.
1607053551|5.0|This is bound to be a very popular book as fabric designing is so desirable and so now. Kimberly starts by taking a look at contemporary fabric design, she then goes deeper into the fundamentals of design and colour. Patten layout and repeats is a good section. She lloks at different ways of designing - by hand drawing, Illustrator and so on. There is an in-depth look at printing methods and producing fabric. Designers give their insight too. I liked the layout and design of this book and it has very good content, written in an easy to understand style with excellent supporting photographs. Basically this book will take you through exactly what you need to know to be a fabric designer. This review first appeared on yarnsandfabrics website.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This solitaire app is entertaining. However. I find it annoying that it asks you what type of deal you want. It would be far better to always give luck of the draw, like the real game.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|Well, first off let me give you a hint.  At 85% done, I stopped reading to look up reviews to see if I was the only one still lost on several answers.  I was not.  Several people mentioned frustration at the lack of closure.<br />Secondly, this is a very fast paced read,  you will not be able to put the book down.  I caught myself skipping to the end of pages/chapters to get a hint of the outcome.  That may have lead to missing some details.  But then so did many other reviewers.  I didn't like this third book enough to restart it to get the details, as in the [[ASIN:B004XJRQUQ The Hunger Games Trilogy]], I immediately turned to page one of the trilogy and restarted it.<br />C.  Anyone remember the movie [[ASIN:B000IHL52W Total Recall]]?  By the end there had been so many twists you had no idea what was right.  I heard Conception was the same, so I haven't watched it.  Anyhoo, I loved the first two books, a third of the way into this book, I pre-ordered the prequel.  Now as I sit with the book finished, I feel a sense of loss, I feel cheated of answers.  Totally lost, any scene with Teresa in it I would groan, she changed stories more times than copies of the book sold.<br />IV. just exactly how many times did Thomas decide someone was his best friend, or whatever, only to be betrayed?  Seriously, just a bit too much drama for my taste.  Which is I guess the same as the plot twists, so many the book could win first place at a Boy Scout knot tie tournament.  I could have taken notes I guess, to keep up, but this was supposed to be fun.<br />Maybe the prequel will have the answers...

0547424779|5.0|This book effected me profoundly as a 12 year old! I found it randomly in my school library one day and it has stayed with me ever since. I had no idea about the constructs that society places on us, conformity etc. at the time but it helped me to think for myself and look outside the norm. I will certainly give this to my children to read.

145162445X|3.0|I kept falling asleep reading this.  I was expecting a revelation from this book, but all I got were quantum fluctuations.  That's it folks.  He attempts to answer the How, but it is the Why that will probably never be answered, he dismisses it outright.  Why are there quantum fluctuations?  I saw him on YouTube and enjoyed his talk, but the book was a bit of a let down.  I guess as much as we have advanced scientifically, there are some questions we my never be able to answer, or even understand the answer if we had.  It's also kind of odd he has not a single footnote.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|i normally dont write long reviews.  usually here i just cut to the chase and get out my thoughts because im sure someone doesnt want to read a book of my thoughts.  by all accounts this may look like a short review but its still long for me.  ill go into a little bit more with these books because they deserve it.  i have just started reading again for fun within the past couple of years.  after college i think i was so bogged down with books meaning work that i didnt want to read anything else for a while.  these books are some of the most enjoyable reading ive had since i started reading again.  they are not deep, not full of themselves, not philosophical... they are pure fun, well thought out and enjoyable reading.  hugh really is a great new author.  he focuses on character development like a pro, and to me a book that doesnt focus on character development isnt one worth my time.  each book individually brings new characters to the overall storyline, and to me this is a refreshing approach from what ive read.  for instance, book one is pretty short.  you can read through it within two hours easily.  but, i think i knew more about the main character and cared more about him in that short bit of reading than i did in some other full lenght novels i read in the past couple of years.  the books also go into great detail in the settings and surroundings.  hugh gives you all you need to really visualize the enviornment and put you in the setting.  if i wrote any more i would start going into spoilers, so im not.  suffice it to say these books are great reading for anyone who enjoys good sci fi, and particularly post apocolyptic kinda stuff (which i do).  $5 for all 5 books for the kindle is an absolute steal.  i would easily spend $25 to $30 on all 5 books and feel good about it.  ive suggested these books to a few friends and they have all dove in and read them faster than i did (i read slow on purpose, i didnt want them to end!) and enjoyed them thoroughly.  spend the few dollars and buy these books.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Okay. This glitch is awesome. What you do is, touch the screen how you want the stars to move. Keep it held down, and then with your free hand, press the power button. Only put the device to sleep. Remove star moving finger, then wake the device. Then just watch. Only testdd for kindle fire.

B005I64U66|2.0|The movie is built around three guys having ridiculously horrible bosses - actually horrible to the point of being beyond reality. It's lowbrow comedy at best, one of the worst films of 2011 at worst. Save your time and money - watch or do something else.
0439023491|4.0|I read the trilogy a couple of years ago but decided to write the review when I had digested it all. And now I have.<br /><br />Just when I thought Suzanne Collins had pulled out all the rabbits from her hat, she pulled out another one as the twist at the end of this corker tale.  The plot was just as disturbing and gripping as \\"Hunger Games\\" and like the good author she is, Suzanne Collins answered some of the questions she set up in book 1.  It is interesting that the love triangle is not hammered at. Rather, Katniss comes across as insightful and intelligent, made wiser by her harrowing experiences and from witnessing the deaths of those she held dear. Recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire continues the story without missing a beat.<br /><br />The addition of the other victors was an excellent part to the story.  I laughed out loud imagining the victor's messing with Katniss prior to the games.  Once the games started, I could not put it down!  The ending was such a surprise.  I did not see that coming at all.
0439023521|4.0|I read the trilogy a couple of years ago but waited until now to write the review after I had digested it all.  Teenagers/children are put up for sacrifice.  Many books follow this premise.  This, however, is the future with all the killing to come being televised live and some of the protagonists are not even in their teens.  The setting is created by the leaders of the empire following a scourge after a nuclear war.  It is a little like \\"The Truman Show\\" except the recording of their experience is exposed to the participants - well most of it is except the staged effects to come.  They know they are in it to kill one another in order to come out alive.  I read this book with my heart in my mouth, not really keen on a book that was like a computer game where killing could be shown carelessly.  It wasn't, but it still felt voyeuristic and fear-inducing.  That 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen is shown to have heart and compassion in all this, and is rarely showed to be a murderer is extraordinary, and believable.  Throughout I wondered how the author would pull off a convincing heroine who at the same time has to murder her peers.  That she has done so is a piece of excellent plotting.  You like Katniss for her courage, her humanness and her humanity.  She is attractive but unaware of it - she knows it doesn't matter what she looks like when she is like putty in the hands of the empire; they are out to get her and her competitors killed as a show of their dominance in the face of potential rebellions like the last one.  Best of all, I liked Katniss for her rebelliousness.  The twist at the end made the whole thing worthwhile.  It wasn't an easy read by any means. But I recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great ending to a great series of books!  Sadly though, it had me wanting more.  There were some surprises in this book that I certainly didn't see coming.  I like how Suzanne Collins didn't make district 13 pure as snow.  Everybody was using everybody in this trilogy.  I think Katniss wound up being with the right person in the end.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works fine on my fire.  I get Radar and forecasts for locations I have put in.  Several are small communities.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow!  What a book!  This book came recommended to me by a fellow co-worker.  He did not steer me wrong.  Once I started reading this, I could not put it down.  This story is so dark, with a splash of hope.  This book starts out like the \\"Lottery\\" I had to read in college, but goes much further.  In my opinion, there is a bit of our society in this story.  How our society loves the silly fashion trends in the book(Lady GaGa) and violence is the big issues in this book.  Add this to your reading list.  You won't be disappointed.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I bought this because I wanted a rubber/plastic composition with the flexible top cover.  Seems like a sturdy product.  And the strap is a great idea, can slide your fingers under it when holding Kindle for extra security.  The big drawback:  The felt cover is like a lint/crumb/debris collector.  It is a fuzzy black polyester or something.  When you wrap it around behind the Kindle Fire (and slide it under the band) it collects lint, crumbs, and fuzz almost immediately.  And it's black...so it's going to show the lint and crumbs.  And when you close it that stuff will be resting right on the display. Doubt I'll want to brush it clean each day...  Otherwise, well-made product.  Am going to stick with it to see how it goes.

I want more.  I hope there is more.  To all you wanting the van halen of old...it aint gonna happen...Van halen IS old.  stop looking for their youth...it is in the past.  Awesome Bass from Wolf too.
B002XTXG1G|5.0|... would probably be interested in the \\"mind\\" of Michael Peterson, also known as \\"Charlie Bronson\\". Perhaps he's already under study. There's a loose hypothesis afloat among evolutionary psychologists that extreme sociopathic behavior is \\"within the norms\\" of human psychology and might have been highly adaptive among early humans -- stone age and earlier pre-H. sapiens. That such hyper-violent people exist, and that they are often endowed with exceptional abilities, is not in doubt. Charlie Bronson, labeled by the tabloid press as the most violent prison inmate in Great Britain, might well have thrived in another cultural framework, in the continual inter-tribal violence of Papua New Guinea, or as a berserker in pre-Christian Scandinavia. He might have been a chief. One wonders, given a different environment, whether Charlie Bronson could have been another Shaka Zulu or Crazy Horse. The real life Michael Peterson is possibly more \\"impressive\\" that the fictive Bronson of this film. He was married twice, for instance. He converted to Islam, then apostatized. He writes poetry and books about fitness regimens; he's had eleven books published, winning several awards. Don't for a second believe, however, that he has somehow become someone safe to share a space with! He's been involved in over a dozen violent hostage-takings, including one as recently as 2007.<br /><br />Charlie is a very violent dude, no doubt of it. If he'd been a Californian, he'd have been sent to the prison called Pelican Bay, and I can assure you he'd be long dead by now because there are others of his ilk. The competition is fierce for being the baddest. The fact that he has spent thirty years in \\"solitary confinement\\" is the sole reason for his survival. This film is therefore, in a secondary way, an expose of the dysfunctional side of the British prisons. Only the truth that there is no normal means to handle someone like Charlie prevents the viewer from interpreting this film as an indictment of the justice and penal systems. But one is distracted by the bizarre horror of Charlie's personality.<br /><br />The film, however, isn't a thorough documentary of the career of Michael Peterson. Much is ignored and some is imagined. There's a framework around the story: Bronson is seen addressing an applauding audience, diagnosing himself for their \\"appreciation\\", miming and masqueing his own identity, sometimes in clown make-up, often smiling like a kung fu Cheshire Cat, exulting in the \\"public's fascination\\" with his rage. One could more easily imagine King Kong being given the stage; this is somebody's fantasy, but you'll need to parse for yourself whether it represents Charlie's or director Nicolas Winding Refn's narcissism. You'll also need to wonder about the blatantly psychotic homophobia in the film, whether it represents a causative factor in Charlie's sociopathy or whether its \\"meaning\\" is something the director needs to express. Or both. Most of the wardens and other figures of \\"control\\" are assertively effeminate. Who knows? There's not much that's explicit and unambiguous about this portrayal of Charlie Bronson. But there's an enormous challenge in the film, a gauntlet thrown down to the public which seems to be insatiable in its craving for films of extreme violence. Here's the real thing, the film seems to say, bloodlust irrational violence of a sort that YOU couldn't handle for a second, and how would you like that, you soft-bellied masturbatory fantacist?ce and penal systems.

1905236042|5.0|I bought this for son when he was two hoping that Yoga would help him calm down.  That didn't exactly work out according to plan, but both my kids have loved these cards as a fun activity to do.  You should them doing \\"Double Dog\\" and \\"Lizard on a Rock\\" together!  The cards are all color coded so that if you were really serious about it you could organize a Yoga session into the proper order of  strength, balance postures, stretches, relaxation exercises etc.  That has never worked out in our household at all however.  Generally what happens for us right now is that my two year old daughter sees the cards on the shelf and thinks: Gee, I want to do Yoga!  Then she dumps all of the cards out onto the floor.  She then picks the first three cards she spots and does the poses.  Five minutes later, the cards are still lying on the living room floor and my daughter is off to the next activity.  Of course, if my husband or I are there with her she will do card after card for almost twenty minutes.  Sometimes she will even help put the cards away!  This in itself takes about five minutes, with her \\"helping\\".  I'd say this deck would work for kids ages 2-8.  So if you are starting to think about future Christmas or Hanukah presents for your kids, this would be a good pick.  There is also a book that goes with it called \\"My Daddy is a Pretzel.\\"

B00005J9U1|4.0|Admit it, back in the late seventies and early eighties we all had our reggae minute, at least a minute anyway. And the center of that minute, almost of necessity, had to be a run-in with the world of Bob Marley and the Wailers, probably I Shot The Sheriff. Some of us stuck with that music and moved on to its step-child be-bop, hip-hop when that moved on the scene. Others like me just took it as a world music cultural moment and put the records (you know records, those black vinyl things, right?) away after a while. And that was that.  Well not quite. Of late the Occupy movement, the people risen, has done a very funny musical thing, at least funny to my ears when I heard it. They, along with the old labor song, Solidarity Forever, and, of course  Brother Woody Guthrie's This Land Is Your  Land , have resurrected Bob Marley's up-from-under fight song, Get Up, Stand Up to fortify the sisters and brothers against the American imperial monster beating down on all of us and most directly under the police baton and tear gas canister. And that seems, somehow, eminently right. More germane here it has gotten me to dust off those old records and give Brother Marley another hear. And you should too if you have been remiss of late with such great songs as (aside from those mentioned already) No Woman, No Cry, Jamming, One Love/People Get Ready (ya, the old Chambers Brother tune), and Buffalo Soldier.  And stand up and fight too.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|Perhaps the most polarizing major label release since M.I.A's [[ASIN:B003ODKZIW /\/\ /\ Y /\ ]], Ms. Del Rey has both her critics and her champions and with this album provides fuel for both camps. Admittedly I fall into the latter category, however I will be the first to admit that her now infamous and almost meme-worthy SNL performance was sub-standard considering what she is capable of. It seems that much of the criticism towards the songs of \\"Born To Die\\" are founded in part on their opinions from that performance. The performance and the album are two separate entities so onward we progress.  My immediate impressions of the album centered around it's atmospheric production. Many have criticized it for being too melodramatic and repetitive. This is often the case as some songs disappear behind it's [[ASIN:B002MCJZHS xx]]inspired production aesthetic. However, it ultimately works for Del Rey. The production is appropriate given the visual aesthetic she brings (a modern day hipster Nancy Sinatra) and the lyrics. While conjuring past artists such as Portishead's [[ASIN:B00000DLV1 Roseland NYC Live]], Poe's [[ASIN:B000002JUW Hello]] and The XX, it manages to differentiate Del Rey from much of the female 'indie' crossover artists of the moment. Without it, songs such as [[ASIN:B006ZDS8I2 Video Games]] would fall into the now ubiquitous territory of Florence and the Machine et al.  Del Rey's vocals on the album are also worthy of mention. While she may not have the range of contemporaries such as Adele, she certainly knows how to use her voice to embellish a song. In interviews Del Rey has stated that she deliberately sings in her laconic alto  because it differentiates her from others. This is true. She will go from a precocious Lolita coo to a more lustful and husky drawl often within the same song ([[ASIN:B006ZDSAY4 Summertime Sadness]]). As a result she brings a sense of character and emotional connection to her songs.  [[ASIN:B006ZDS7CE Born To Die]] is not a perfect album; it wanes in the middle,  it doesn't contain much range lyrically and is often weighted under such lyrical cliches as \\"...Let me kiss you hard it the pouring rain...\\". However it more than justifies the hype that Del Rey garnered with the viral hit [[ASIN:B006ZDS8I2 Video Games]]. She manages to create her own niche of indie pop that while may not be to everyone's taste, is certainly unique and refreshing. Songs such as the title track and [[ASIN:B006ZDS9AE National Anthem]] are key examples of the way this album manages to create the perfect combination of it's atmospheric production aesthetic and instrumentation. The potential for the future is boundless.  8/10.

Even if u have a AM3+ MB, I suggest you get a Phenom II cpu, much better processor than the BD, IMO. So if have an am3 or am3+ MB and want to upgrade, get the PII or if u have some cash on you, I5 or I7 rig is so very nice. Don't get me wrong, I am cheering on for AMD, but AMD just had a major mishap with this cpu, but so did the Phenom when it came out and hopefully a BD II will fix all the cons this cpu has.
0596527055|2.0|I didn't like it. It's the second book of Scott Berkun that I read, the first one was Confessions of a public speaker. It was nothing really special but it was fun and genuine. The Myths of Innovation is not entertaining, it is not original, it is not interesting.  I gave it a try but it was not worth the time. It is more a historical book about what innovation is than a real book about innovation. I would not recommend it.  Disclaimer: this review is part of a blogger program by O'Reilly Media.

0792846443|5.0|As always, Stephen King stories hit the mark.  I have always loved this movie for its real-life action.  The director, Rob Reiner, and screenwriter, William Goldman with King riding shotgun, have kept King's story close to the truth of his actual writing.  The movie is worth the money and the time it takes to sit down with a bowl of popcorn and some friends.  You will need to fill your bowl before the movie starts since you will be on the edge of your recliner and will not want to break eye contact or miss any part of the scary plot.  There are times that one needs to cover the eyes unless you love punishment and off the wall (Bates) \\"Annie Wilkes\\" behavior as Paul Sheldon's \\"#1 Fan!\\"
0062082353|5.0|A story of courage, dedication and determination! A must read for every lover of adventure and country. This book has renewed my admiration for our youth!
076790592X|3.0|I didn't come to reading this with any great expectations, and, strangely enough, considering the fact that the subject was dying, I found it to be a pleasant diversion. Larger issues involving one's life weren't addressed within its pages, as they shouldn't have been. Those issues are for the reader to debate.<br /><br />The book itself was a pretty quick read. That doesn't mean it was a bad read, but it didn't throw me for a loop either. Simply put, this is the cliffs-notes version of a dying man's last days, as related by a one-time student. Morrie must have touched Mitch on a deeper level for him to return and record Morrie's thoughts for posterity. For me, the 16-year or so gap in communication means nothing. After all, how many people can say that they've been able to keep in touch with someone long after they were in their company, despite promises to do so? Life happens.<br /><br />To me, it appears that Morrie was more interested in the intangibles that life contains. Yes, he was a Professor, but it appeared to me that he was about assisting his students as they try to navigate their way through life, rather than instructing them in a specific area that would lead them into a specific profession that may result in only one corridor of one's life being explored.<br /><br />As others have, I'm not going to question the effect that Morrie had on Mitch. Most Mentor relationships are not easily quantifiable. The book ultimately suffers from one fact: it's often hard to put into words the profound effect that one person can have on another. Sure, specifics can be given, an example being a journalist given instruction on how to conduct an interview. But, mostly, the effect could go much deeper. Thought processes can be altered and sensibilities can be changed. Attitudes are forever dispensed with. I'm not so sure that Mitch was able to fully convey what Morrie meant to him and just how much his life benefitted from Morrie's presence. Thus the book comes off as being somewhat trite, seemingly chock full of quotes you'd find in a fortune cookie.<br /><br />A quick scan of Mitch Albom's Amazon Bio reveals how prolific he has been with regard to his chosen endeavor. Only he can tell you if his various projects were the direct result of Morrie's influence. But either way, it appears that he's looking to leave his mark on the Creative Writing landscape.<br /><br />As for the hate, it seems that many people are so consumed with their hatred of this book that they will go into great detail describing just how much they hate, hate, hate it. Have I told you just how much some people hate this book? I don't get it. Sure, there are any number of grammatical issues contained within, and Mitch's \\"epiphanies\\" can be seen as too simple and pat. I also believe that we as a society have developed an inability to handle complex issues and, as a result, we are always looking for the answers on a billboard, or we look to people like Oprah Winfrey for spiritual guidance(I shudder at the thought). I just find the book to be too light to justify the venom.<br /><br />In Superman: The Movie, Lex Luthor told Ms. Tessmacher that \\"some could read War and peace, and come away thinking it's a simple adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper, and unlock the secrets of the universe\\". For many readers, the effect of the book was a greatly positive one, and that's okay. For others, they couldn't wait to be done with it, and that's okay too.<br /><br />Different works mean different things to different people.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|Okay, it seems like we all have to qualify up front so I will as well.  I am a VH fan from near the beginning while in high school.  I  have seen them in concert only about three times and always with David Lee Roth. Not that I did not like Sammy or Gary C. but I just never got around to seeing those incarnations though I purchase every cd.  My favorite in carnation is a tie between Roth and early Sammy...so I guess Roth wins. Now that I have that out of the way...<br /><br />  I am not sure what I was expecting with this cd but I wanted every song to sound like a #1 hit and they don't.  I got over that quickly as I recaled that none of their cd's have all hit songs (even their greatest hits collctions).  I also could  not stand \\"Tatoo\\" when I first heard it and saw the video. Yet, I gave this new cd a shot and played it a few times....<br /><br />  Suddenly after hearing it for the third or forth time, when I was just letting the music flow and not trying to analyze or dissect it, it suddenly hit me that this is a very good cd.  \\"Tatoo\\" grew on me, and \\"Stay Frosty\\" has kind of an \\"Ice Cream Man\\" vibe, but different.  Like almost every other studio cd by this band the complete package tends to overshadow the individal tunes.  In fact ,the one VH/Roth album that had the least amount of hits, while still having great tunes for me was \\"Fair Warning,\\" and in many ways this reminds me of that.<br /><br />  Good guitar licks and hard pounding drumming, memoable vocals by Roth and bass lines by Wolfgang.  I do miss the more natural harmonies provided by their pevious bass player, but they do a good job of making up for that by doubling Roth's voice when necessary.  I will let the other reviews here go song by song, and will only leave you with my comment that this is an overall good cd though it may never be considared a classic.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|You might notice the date for this post is two weeks before launch. that is because I am part of the military and was invited to an advance showing of this movie.<br /><br />Non-spoiler summary: Act Of valor is based around SEAL Team 7 sometime around September 2010. This is a fictionalized film, these events really did not happen but they are based on events that have happened to SEALS since the war on terrorism. In 2007 the two directors of this film, Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh, worked on a film project where the navy allowed them to work with real Navy SEALS. The directors came out with an idea to make a realistic movie based on the Navy SEALS. While deciding on casting they decided that the only people they wanted playing the Seals were the Seals they met themselves. Act of Valor uses real Navy SEALS and at times real ammunition in some of the fire fight scenes.<br /><br />If you have not seen this film I definitely recommend to at least rent it. It is not a documentary but it is the most realistic military movie that I have seen. Definitely worth a viewing.<br /><br />Some Spoilers:<br /><br />A CIA operative is captured by a drug smuggler. SEAL Team 7 is sent in to save her. SEAL Team 7 discovers the Drug smuggler is connected to a high level terrorist that seeks vengeance on America. The SEALS are in a race against time to uncover the plot and stop the terrorist before they reach their target in America.

0312641893|5.0|Anyone can write a re-telling of Cinderella, but only Marissa Meyer can write a fantastic, original, and completely enchanting Cinderella re-telling as amazing as this one!<br /><br />To say that I loved this book would be an understatement! Cinder dodged every bullet I worried about when I picked it up. Rather than being a simple Cinderella knock-off, Meyer created a story with lovable characters, a captivating world, and a story line that was a blast to follow from beginning to end.<br /><br />For a cyborg and the best mechanic in New Beijing, Cinder surprised me with her spunk, sarcasm, and fun personality that made me adore her from start to finish! Prince Kai was so adorable, just like the sweet and fairytale-esque romance between them. It was perfectly developed and had the right amount of scenes that made your cheeks hurt from smiling.<br /><br />Another thing that made Cinder so original and captivating was the world. There are robots, cyborgs, an otherworldly plague with no cure -- and there was also a really cool supernatural aspect with the Lunars (moon people), who could basically control minds and make people see things that weren't real.<br /><br />A mixture of both fairytale and dystopian elements with a supernatural twist, Cinder is a mesmerizing debut that you don't want to miss! This is one of those books that I'd recommend to everybody because I honestly believe that it can be enjoyed by anyone who can read! :)<br /><br />BUY or BORROW?: I'm definitely planning on buying myself a copy of this book! If that doesn't say BUY ME like a neon sign, I don't know what would!
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|I don't know about other parents, but I am usually pretty appalled by Disney movies.  Bambi, Nemo, Lion King, all dead parents prominent in the plots.  I hadn't seen Toy Story I or II before watching Toy Story III.  Although, I don't like Lotso's bad grammar, or (SPOILER ALERT) that he never reforms, but I like the double entendres and references to humor on more than one level.  I like the real-life drama that Andy is going to college.  And I love the camaraderie between the toys.  And one more spoiler, there is a happy ending.  Well, I cried, but it IS a happy ending.  There are few kids movie's I can give 5 stars for, and this is one of them.

B005I4JG80|5.0|I picked up this book the same day it came out and started reading it on the train home. I enjoyed it so much that I didn't want to get off at my stop... I usually don't write reviews - in fact, this is my first book review ever. But this book is so fascinating and well-written that I thought it warranted writing one.  Bringing up Bebe opened up a whole new parenting philosophy to me. I was afraid this philosophy would entail too much discipline, strictness, and punishments, but it really doesn't. It's quite a simple philosophy that includes boundaries and rules but also a fresh and new take on teaching your child patience and politeness, \\"tuning in\\" to your baby's rhythms, enjoying simple pleasures, giving your child enough freedom, and how to instill an appreciation of different foods (and much more, of course). The book is warm and surprisingly funny with lots of real-life stories, examples, interviews with pediatricians and parents, studies, and the author's own observations.  Druckerman is far from preachy - she doesn't tell you how to raise your child, instead she humorously and carefully tells how most French parents do it and what she implements with her own children along the way. Just like the author, I don't love everything about French parenting and culture (and I'm sure I would find that with most parenting styles and cultures around the globe, including different American ones), but the good thing is that you can leave behind what doesn't suit you and implement what does. Without being a how-to book, I still came away with lots of practical ideas and new ways of viewing parenthood.  Apart from French parenting, you'll also get a bonus glimpse into French culture, which is totally fascinating. Loved it.

B005X7HA6C|4.0|This is a Japanese gangsta flick from the directorial hand of Takeshi Kitano. It is a full throttle story of the Yakuza and the various families (or crime syndicates) that control the Kanto region. It is full of intrigue and double plotting but the one thing that runs as a vein throughout this film is violence. Good old fashioned, medieval, nasty violence.<br /><br />The Uber crime Lord is called Mr Chairman and actually does dress like some despotic ruler of a `democratic republic' like say North Korea. Even his servants wear the same white tracksuits - even when they are serving dinner, I think you will find that Debretts classes that as a massive faux pas, but hey these are Japanese Mafiosi types and so probably aren't well read.<br /><br />He discovers that two of his under lords have made some sort of pact to be `sworn brothers'  whilst both serving time in one of Japans 1 star detention facilities. This he does not like and so demands that a sort of insult be done to prove that not all brothers do get along. Well one thing leads to another and as face is lost, and a few other bits - like fingers-, the retaliations ramp up. The land and powere grabs all come at a price and the fortunes of each change with the rapidity of a guns magazine being emptied.<br /><br />This is acted, directed and filmed in a stylish and no holds barred way. It just roars along, and keeps the shocks coming. There are some well inventive ways of dealing with your enemies and some brutal violence that made me squirm. The Japanese codes of honour and rampant disrespect to your underlings are heavily in evidence. This is just naked greed meets unfettered ambition in a tsunami of double crosses and violence and I thought it was excellent.<br /><br />This is not one for the squeamish but all lovers of extreme Asian cinema will find a place for this in their collections. In Japanese with a smidgin of English, this is not that short a film but just flew by for me - highly recommended.

0446401307|4.0|This offering in the Harry Bosch series is ideal for that long plane ride where you have seen the movies already. Once again Connelly has hit the nail on the head with a mystery that keeps the reader spell bound and turning the pages. Throw in a terrorism angel and the reader is trapped into turning page after page to reach the conclusion. A conclusion which the reader could never have expected from the way the investigation runs about the murder. The FBI inserts itself into the mix as well and Bosch is working with a new partner who is very skeptical about Bosch's tactics. The additional characters make the mystery interesting which seems pretty straight forward to all but Bosch.  This story is quickly told, and expertly written. As Bosch and the FBI chase leads trying to out do each other Bosch comes up the winner with the final solution. (Which I guarantee will blow away the reader) Oh, it's murder alright, but how it was designed, carried out, and who was supposed to benefit from the killing are real shockers at the end of the book.  When Bosch lays it all out for the reader you will just want to find another Harry Bosch book to keep your high going with this type of writing.

B006I1OB0U|5.0|I have viewed the C. Special a number of times now. I couldn't wait for its North American release, so I ordered it as a single disc from Amazon UK in December since I had already bought Series 2 from the UK back in November and it did not include the C. Special. (We have a region-free/code-free DVD player.) Personally, I think that series 1 & 2 and the C. Special are all fabulous in countless ways. Top quality entertainment all the way.  My only complaint is that I wish Julian Fellows hadn't written the 'downstairs' characters playing with a Ouji board. The script would have been just fine without that in it. The family playing Charades was fine and certainly innocuous and Mary's turn was nice and light.  Having said that, this \\"C. Special\\" is the very best. I am agreeing with the actors themselves in numerous interviews while they were in North America (for Awards season) and later after returning back home in the U.K. The casting director is to be congratulated. Each actor is just perfect in their respective roles. The actors playing Mrs Bates, Sir Richard Carlisle, O'Brien and Thomas respectively, certainly earned their pay cheques. YUCK! However, by the end of Series 2 we can see how O'Brien and Thomas' personalities have begun somewhat of a transformation as life teaches them lessons.(As we too learn lessons in real life that will challenge our own value systems, such as 'we will reap what we sow\\" and allowing others to enter our comfort zone when there is a need. Mary is a case in point. When series 1 began we see her as a snobbish, self centered personality. Watching her helping and caring for Matthew's health and disabilities during the war is so beautiful.  I applaud each and every one of the actors beginning of course with, the indomitable Dame Maggie Smith. (Youtube shows all of the actors behind the scenes getting ready for their parts, and great interviews with most of the actors. The real owners even guides us through many of the 126 room castle in which the series takes place.)  I first saw Hugh Bonnevile in [[ASIN:B000M2E32M Daniel Deronda]] recommended by Amazon.com. I despised his character and felt that he got what he deserved in the end. What arrogance! What haughtiness! And a calloused abuser to boot! He played that part to the hilt opposite Romola Garai. If you have never seen it, do check it out here on Amazon. In The Cazalets, [[ASIN:B0002XVS6A Masterpiece Theatre - The Cazalets]] Hugh was excellent also. But here, in Downton Abbey as the handsome Lord Grantham, he is truly Exceptional!  Michelle Dockery and Dan Stevens are very much 'in sync' with their characters. What a love story! Anyone who has ever found love and lost it due to immature errors in their youth will identify with the painful hurt and longing revealed in their eyes. Michelle and Dan say they have had a great time playing M&M in this series.  They have great on-screen chemistry.  It is definitely true that one must see this \\"C. Special\\" in order to keep up the continuity of the story thus bridging the gap from Series 2 to Series 3, (due out in September in the U.K.)

The packaging for this album is excellent and the quality of the vinyl is top notch. Rolling People has never sounded better! This being the first record I'd ever ordered from Amazon, I was quite impressed that they had a proper LP sized box for shipping. Definitely encourages me order more records in the future.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Kind of felt similiar to The Notebook - not a bad thing.  Very good read.  Immediately passed it on to someone else - sign of a good book, if you say to a friend, you HAVE to read this.
B004ECDNJU|3.0|I have a kindle fire and in theory this game is great fun. I like the speed controls and the various levels. In reality the arrows don't always go in the direction I am indicating them to go or they doesn't move at all sometimes.  Too frustrating for now but I will try again if there's an update.
B005P3NPXG|2.0|If you had told me in the summer of 1991, in the midst of listening to Seal's \\"Crazy\\" and his self-titled debut, that one day he would devolve into schmaltz I would have said fat chance. Yet, 20 years on, here is the nadir of Seal's career. His third dud recording in a row. This, and his previous two albums \\"Commitment\\" and \\"Soul\\" are void of anything interesting. It's as if Seal has been castrated, or an imposter put in his place--some robot on autopilot. His last good album was \\"System\\". Why? Well, Seal should always be surrounded by electronics--that's where he sounds best. Forget schmaltz master producer David Foster--I mean look what he did to Chicago in the 1980's. He killed a once great band dead with his balladry and sterile production values.<br /><br />If Trevor Horn did much on \\"Soul 2\\" it's not evident. It feels like David Foster through and through. The only good thing about \\"Soul 2\\" is Seal's vocals. I particularly thought he handled \\"Ooh Baby Baby\\" and \\"What's Going On\\" extremely well in terms of how controlled his vocals were.<br /><br />The problem here will be beaten to death--these cover versions do nothing. Why even make them? I mean, really? They are worthless. They do not even come close to the originals, and no one tried to do something unique with any of them. Cue Starbucks background music now. That's what Seal's music has become--a coaster to rest your coffee beverage on.<br /><br />I don't like being so negative about an artist, but this irks me to no end. Seal was once a great artist and he has totally taken an about face with his career. I don't care how many copies he sells, the fact remains that his last three albums (this one included) have been utterly forgettable. I hope Seal reads his customers' reviews here, because he needs a kick in the pants. His next album better be good, or it's the end of his career. Perhaps his recent divorce will spark some passion and creativity and hopefully it will translate to his music.<br /><br />I can't recommend any tracks here because they're all not worth listening to. So here it is, this is how \\"Soul 2\\" compares to Seal's previous work:<br /><br />1991 Seal: Five Stars<br />1994 Seal: Five Stars<br />1998 Human Being: Five Stars<br />2001 Togetherland: (I guess we'll never know, will we?)<br />2003 IV: Four Stars<br />2007 System: Four Stars<br />2008 Soul: Two and a Half Stars<br />2010 Commitment: Three Stars<br />2011 Soul 2: Two Starshey're all not worth listening to. So here it is, this is how \\"Soul 2\\" compares to Seal's previous work:  1991 Seal: Five Stars  1994 Seal: Five Stars  1998 Human Being: Five Stars  2001 Togetherland: (I guess we'll never know, will we?)  2003 IV: Four Stars  2007 System: Four Stars  2008 Soul: Two and a Half Stars  2010 Commitment: Three Stars  2011 Soul 2: Two Stars

B001UV4XHY|5.0|This movie is great. The price is right. The delivery was timely. The quality of the movie is top notch. Thank you. Good job.
B0068TL23G|5.0|This game has simple design connecting dots in the shortest sequence-but don't let its simplicity fool you...some of the levels are quite difficult to get 5 stars on! It's extremely addicting! It has a lot of replay value, as some levels require several repeats to get the connections in the shortest distance. I'm on the eighth chapter, for those that mentioned the game ended after only a few levels.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great time waster. Fun game, addicting to play. And the ads are very unobtrusive. Bright clear graphics &amp; intuitive interface.
0440245915|3.0|John Grisham is to be commended for his socially-conscious plots and the way in which he aids other writers. This, his first novel, is probably his best. I say \\"probably\\" because I've read only three of them: the rest, I wait for the movie to come out. The reason I wait for the movie to come out is that it cuts to the chase, capturing the essentials of plot, character, and conflict. They're all there in each of the Grisham novels, but they sure are weighted down with verbiage. The old saying, \\"Two words are not as good as one,\\" is something this author should think about: he writes long, tedious sentences and tells us things we don't have to know . . . maybe just because he wrote them that day at his computer. Each of his novels would benefit from rewriting.<br /><br />That said, I think this is a gripping plot: Carl Lee, a black man in Mississippi, kills the man who raped his daughter. Will Carl Lee be sentenced to death for doing what would be approved behavior in any white Mississippi man? That's the central conflict of the book. I'm not convinced that in real life the story would end the way it does in the novel, but I'm happy with the ending of the novel: it's the only ending that satisfies.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I read the reviews on this cover and was a bit hesitant.  Let me tell you, it's perfect!  It's lightweight so it does not add any additional weight to your Kindle Fire.  It's very protective of the Kindle casing and easy to use.  There are no zippers or snaps to worry about.  It fits better than a glove and looks great!  When I open my bag, there is no fumbling to find by Kindle.  Since my cover is bright pink, I can pick it right out.  When I am lounging back with my Kindle on my leg, the cover provides a non-slip surface.  It does everything I want it to do and on top of that, it looks great!  You cannot go wrong with this purchase!
B000SSPL0I|5.0|This historical 1955 recording was the first to gather an all stars cast covering all the 6 main roles. Never before and never after at this level for sure.All singers are caught here at their absolute best, and their best was something we do not hear these days. Molinari Pradelli, who was one of the leading conductors of the era, today sounds a bit outdated, nevertheless it holds the ship with authority like many of his peers of the period (Gavazzeni, Erede, Capuana,a/o).  The singers are absolutely the best for the role, Del Monaco sings with fierce voice when required, but can be tender lover for his Leonora, and his dynamics are fine. He shows it in his main aria (after the recitativo \\"la vita è inferno all'infelice\\" at the start of the aria \\" O tu che in seno agli angeli\\")and in various other occasions (\\"ne gustare m'è dato un'ora di quiete\\", after the battle and in other moments)where he holds the voice showing that he could do it when required. I would have preferred a less excited entrance though, when he goes, at the start, to pick up Leonor to run away, but it is a minor flaw. Those who talk about loud singing simply go for stereotypes without having listened properly to the recording. It is a pleasure to listen to his duets with the great Bastianini. Renata Tebaldi, is Leonora, no one else can come close. Her \\"La Vergine degli Angeli\\" is said to have caused some conversions to catholicism. Be it as it may, surely we are looking at something never repeated after. Her partnership with del Monaco here is probably at its best. Bastianini had probably the most beautiful baritone voice ever recorded, even if at times this was privileged over technical accuracy. Despite this, his Don Carlo keeps at far distance any other and his duets with Mario are simply electrifying. Siepi was the best bass voice those days and his \\"morbidezza\\" was legendary. No score could cause him any trouble, and Forza does not take him to task, he flies high with class and elegance, greatly missed after his retirement. Corena, basso buffo, is at ease in the clownish Fra' Melitone role even if some top notes present clearly some problems. Simionato was a luxury for Preziosilla role and she delivers it with ease, but it was not her role and the impression is more of a marketing necessity rather than anything else.  All the other minor roles are covered with dignity by those involved. This recording, to me, is one of the few that can be considered \\"perfect\\" in the sense that all gave their absolute best and they were also at their best at that particular time. Rare occurrence.
1592537251|5.0|I just got my copy of The Art of Urban Sketching and I love it! It's a sumptuous feast for the sketcher's heart, laying out the inspiration for us to  \\"see the world one drawing at a time.\\" The book details the simplicity and the diversity of the urban sketcher's mission, walking us through each step of the manifesto with multiple illustrations. Hundreds of sketches from all around the world add to the feast. We can see street scenes from Seattle to Orlando, coffee shops in San Antonio, subway patrons in Dublin, a market in Kowloon, and so many more images of the world as interpreted by sketchers around the globe.  The book has a dynamic layout, non-linear, yet ordered with color-coded sections and patterned displays. There are descriptions of materials and processes, artist profiles, quotes and, of course . . . the sketches.  Fun, informative and above all inspirational, I recommend it without reservation.
0307957934|3.0|\\"Not bad\\" is how I'd sum up THE FEAR INDEX.  Of course, \\"not bad\\" has as its corollary, \\"not great, either.\\"  It was well-written and fast-paced, but a bit predictable as to where it was headed.  There were little twists and turns, but I kept thinking that it logically could only result in one conclusion.  I also had the vague feeling that I'd seen something similar, in regards to the \\"YOU hired me\\" part of the plot somewhere before.  Not exactly the same, but similar.  Possibly some book where somebody's future self got involved with their \\"today\\" body--not that there's any time travelling in this book!  It just struck me as familiar.  Anyways, that lack of surprising options for endings left THE FEAR INDEX a bit lacking in the fear department--UNLESS you consider the real world implications of computer-controlled trading in the financial sectors.  If the scenario in this book is even just a tiny bit akin to the possibilities for algorithmic programs \\"learning\\" too much for our own good, THAT IS SCARY.  The characters were believable, especially Inspector LeClerc.  The dialogue was realistic.  Some of the plot twists were rather surprising.  Only the overall climax of the story lacked suspense--again, because very early on in the book it appeared to be the only logical outcome--barring aliens attacking, \\"it was only a dream!\\" or some other such nonsense.  In short, THE FEAR INDEX is one of those books that's reasonably good the FIRST time you read it, but you would probably never want to read it again.  I'd give THREE STARS to THE FEAR INDEX.  Makes you think about how it might be relevant to the real world, but a bit too easy to figure out where it's going to end up.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has a lot of different level and they are pretty self explanatory the levels are pretty easy to beat
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I bought this cover as it really caught my eye.  Everyone is right about the fit being tight but it's secure.  I have no problems with it closing.  I get alot of compliments on it, I love the texture and it is just cute.  I would love to see more Kindle Fire covers with a splash of color.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I can't put this game down it is even better then regular solitaire since you actually have to think to play this one. You need to plan a move prior to taking a move
B006UG90RM|2.0|Had to check my calendar. What year is it? 1984? Reagan in the White House? Selena Gomez not even born? Six years before Britney, Christina & Justin on the Micky Mouse Club?  Yes, I'll buy the CD. I'm not paying $100 or more (saw tickets for more than $1,000 locally on the floor) for a band that should be playing gaming casinos. Feel the same way about the Eagles. Timothy Schmidt tours for $27, Joe Walsh $100+. Artists need to realize - I was front row for Taylor Swift for less than VH, Walsh or Eagles - and she's just starting her 50 year career, not at the casino end.  Yes, I'd love to see VH, but I'm not making several car payments or home payments to do so.  Van Halen never released the completed album with Gary Cerrone - the second one. Heard some of the tracks from it and Eddie's guitar playing more stellar than on this CD.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Let me say first of all I like DLR and Sammy VH, but theres something a little more special about EVH's guitar playing when DLR is on the record. Vocals are solid enough ,but Sam's voice has more range. Maybe thats why EVH kicks it up a notch to cover DLR's limitations,I'm not sure.Ed is playing the rawest guitar work I've heard since at least 1984 or maybe even the great Fair Warning album! DLR may have lost some high ranges but he still sounds good.For the record it should be obvious I liked VH from the very beginning. When I was in Jr.High and first heard the great opening to runnin with the devil ,I quickly realized I was hearing something new and exciting and maybe I'm feeling it a little bit again, but don't let the fact that a old rock fan feels this way. I believe anyone at any age that is a fan of classic hard rock will likely enjoy this album if givin the chance!See em on the road!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app. Time flies when I play It.<br /><br />It has an option of dealing a winning deal and if you get stuck you can click show me and a video appears that teaches you how to win that hand.....it's awesome!!!!

B005H0IW6W|2.0|I like Michael Buble but this CD does not deliver.  Bought it cuz the ratings were so favorable.  It was a waste of money.
B0045I3EJC|3.0|Anything could have happened in Mr.Nobody's past. The movie explores: what would happen, if he could have done things different, at key points in his life. The movie jumps forward and back from the future to his past life. It also jumps between parallel possible lives. If you are an intellectual looking for some dynamic meaning or a stoner you will love this movie.
B00005LIN0|4.0|I shared this video with about 10 people in my opera club. Everyone loved the performance. The only problem was we could not understand what they were saying, so we had to used the sub.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Fun to play so far.  Some of the games are really easy and others can test your patience.  Great way to pass time and have fun.  Good for all ages.

1594202710|4.0|In 1971, U.S. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger visited China to negotiate a \\"world shaking\\" alliance between the two Cold War adversaries. Since then, he has continued to help manage the Sino-American relationship, most notably in the aftermath of the June 4 crackdown, when Kissinger is said to have negotiated a deal that permitted the dissident Fang Lizhi, who had sought sanctuary in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, to flee to the United States, thereby resolving a potentially explosive political impasse.  In his new book On China, Henry Kissinger offers a framework for future U.S.-China relations by looking back at China's diplomatic history, starting from 1793-4, when the Qing empire rebuffed Britain's Lord George Macartney's attempt to establish a diplomatic relationship. Back then, Britain, like the United States today, was a missionary power, intent on spreading the gospel of Christianity and free trade. But China back then saw itself as it sees itself today: The Middle Kingdom, the glorious sun that tributary states must revolve around in order to receive its light.  Kissinger explains the difference in Western and Chinese diplomacy and geo-political strategy with two board games. Westerners play chess, positioning its power on the board, striking at the enemy with logic and planning. Chinese play Go, a game in which winning requires encircling your opponent.  To understand how differently these two games are played, consider Kissinger's first visit to China to negotiate with Premier Zhou Enlai what would later become the Shanghai Communique. Kissinger came to China with a timetable and talking points, but Zhou preferred that Kissinger visit the Forbidden City, and extend his stay. Whereas Kissinger hoped to achieve his diplomatic mission quickly and directly, Zhou surrounded Kissinger with flattery and personal attention to break down his defenses.  Since that fateful rite of passage, Kissinger has continued to advise Chinese and American Presidents, and by writing On China no doubtKissinger hopes current and future policymakers can benefit from his understanding of Chinese thinking. And as a policy book, On China demonstrates how Kissinger has mastered the games of both chess and Go so that he can communicate effectively to both his Chinese and U.S. foreign policy audiences.  For China's current and future policymakers, Kissinger reminds them of Mao Zedong's disastrous diplomacy, in which the Great Helmsman managed to surround and almost strangle China by alienating the Soviet Union, the United States, and India while debilitating China's industrial capacity and ability to wage war.  To criticize Mao Zedong, Kissinger first surrounds him with obsequious praise before turning Mao's own words against him.  In 1958, Chairman Mao ordered the shelling of Taiwan's offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu, deliberately provoking the United States, which had treaty obligations to defend Taiwan. And why play such a dangerous game? Here's Mao's reported reasoning for his actions:  \\"[T]he bombardment of Jinmen [Quemoy], frankly speaking, was our turn to create international tension for a purpose. We intended to teach the Americans a lesson. America had bullied us for many years, so now that we had a chance, why not give it a hard time?\\"  When Khrushchev sent his Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko to Beijing to calm down his impetuous ally lest he start a nuclear war, Mao explained to Gromyko how China and the Soviet Union could destroy the Americans, albeit at the cost of hundreds of millions of Chinese lives:  \\"I suppose the Americans might go so far as to unleash a war against China. China must reckon with this possibility, and we do. But we have no intention of capitulating! If the USA attacks China with nuclear weapons, the Chinese armies must retreat from the border regions into the depths of the country. They must draw the enemy in deep so as to grip U.S. forces in a pincer inside China...Only when the Americans are right in the central provinces should you give them everything you've got.\\"  Kissinger contrasts Mao Zedong's foreign policy with that of Deng Xiaoping, but careful to not disrupt the cosmic Communist unity that Chinese leaders so cherish, he first explains that Mao's Cultural Revolution had paved the way for Deng's economic reforms: \\"Mao destroyed traditional China and left its rubble building blocks for ultimate modernization.\\"  In contrast to Mao's vengeful pride, Deng practiced a pragmatic humility, traveling to the West to solicit for technology and expertise to help modernize China, an act that Mao would have interpreted as treason. Kissinger avoids quoting \\"brilliant\\" Mao's famous aphorisms, but does quote Deng's 24-character statement on how China ought to manage international affairs: \\"Observe carefully; secure our position; cope with affairs calmly; hide our capacities and bide our time; be good at maintaining a low profile; and never claim leadership.\\"  For Kissinger, China's fragile geo-political and economic situation can be directly linked to Mao's violent idealism, while China's strategic alliances and economic rise can be credited to Deng's modest pragmatism. That's a very strong message to China's current leadership, who are witnessing a revival of Mao Zedong rhetoric in the Chinese military, as exemplified by Col. Liu Mingfu's book China Dream.  For American policymakers, Kissinger directly cautions them to ignore Chinese nationalistic rhetoric (just as Zhou Enlai once cautioned Kissinger to ignore Mao's rhetoric). For Kissinger, Communist Party leaders are first and foremost Chinese strategists who practice Realpolitik: \\"China's strategy generally exhibits three characteristics: meticulous analysis of long-term trends, careful study of tactical options, and detached exploration of operational decisions.\\"  Kissinger believes that by building diplomatic institutions (what he calls the \\"Pacific Community\\") China and the United States could avoid another Cold War; The Qing's rebuff of Lord Macartney is a history that must not repeat itself.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love this case, its thin and is very lightweight. I first bought a leather one at bestbuy when I got my kindlefire and I hated it so much, it was not durable and it felt like my kindlefire will fall out if I don't hold it at a specific angle (I returned it), but this I got and I couldn't be more satisfied!! Plus on top of that I have received a touch pen which is for me especially is amazing, cuz I hate touchscreens and witith it it doesn't bother me anymore. I also received a cloth to clean the screen which is also very nice! Overall I am very satisfied with everything!! Thank you!
0446585025|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this book. A slow reader, I got through it in less than 24 hours. I was motivated to read every word. And I clung to every word, tearing and then laughing. Not only does Ellen convey important messages - about the environment, kindness to one other, etc. - but she does so in a funny, light way that is relatable and real. I can't thank her enough. She is my favorite funny lady, after Lucille Ball. (I love Kristen Wiig from SNL, too!)If you need to get away from your troubles, read this and watch her show. Results will appear soon and within a week, you'll be better and improved. And maybe new in some way, too. A big dolphin hug from the New York City area, home of the big blue (like your eyes) GIANTS!
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|could also be worse... but doesn't seem worth the money.. too easy at times, too ridiculous at others.. if you want a game that's not gonna require brain power this is for you.. not as good as lost city.. nowhere near grisly manor... or crystal portal... has left me wanting... :(
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is great for those boring days at school or for those long vacation trips away from home and stuff
B0002S943O|5.0|This is an excellent show from beginning to end.  If you are a fan you will love this concert.  Incredible audio.  I know this price is a lil high but IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY. Simply amazing.
0439023513|2.0|Very engaging, another page-turner. However, it does not stand alone, you have to have read the other books.<br /><br />I know that from her perspective, Katniss will always be a simple coal-miner's daughter, and not really \\"The Mockingjay\\" that is someone else's symbol. But she has that \\"X-factor\\" that she herself can't see, but Peeta does, and he comments on it often.<br /><br />The author had a lot of 'loose ends' to tie up and only a limited amount of time to do it in, kind of like a certain \\"Boy Wizard\\" we all know...<br /><br />I would have liked to learned more about the other districts of Panem through her eyes... Katniss could have gone and visited them and spent less time huddled in a corner, studying her navel. I suppose the story is about how much of your own freedom / self are you willing to give up for the sake of liberty for all?<br /><br />I still think that the series could have been been concluded in a more hopeful way. And help our young adults to learn that they can take control of their own lives and make their own future from their dreams.<br />On the other hand - if you don't like the ending or want to write more about what happens to the characters after the events of \\"Mockingjay\\" then you can do that! It's still a free country!<br />GBA.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|After seeing a preview of this movie I had to have it.  I waited until it came out.  I have watched this film at least 5 times in 3 weeks.  I love it.  It is a literati's dream. A wistful little smile crosses my face whenever I think about this movie.  Woody really hit it on the nail with this one.  So much insider references, light, casual, and entertaining.  Love the beautiful colors/lighting for this film.  The pace is relaxed and the mood is magical.  What a delight, what a display of reverence not only for Paris, but for literature, art, and the lost generation in the Paris of the 20's. Enjoy
0439023491|5.0|This book gives more background on the Capitol and all of the main characters that were in the first book.<br /><br />What is \\"Catching Fire\\" is the hearts of the citizens of the Districts that groan under the oppressive heel of the evil President and the demands of the Capitol. The heroine's defiance of the Capitol's rules in the Arena serves to inspire all around her to work towards overthrowing the current system of government. Winning the Hunger Games was only the beginning of the fight for the heroine's freedom as she and her loved ones will always be under surveillance by the Capitol.<br /><br />The heroine is forced to re-enter the arena with 23 other winners of previous games in a new fight-to-the-death. Her own instincts seem to work to her advantage (as usual) because this time around , more than ever before, survival depends on well-made alliances.<br /><br />I won't give the plot away, but it is another page-turner! Excellent for fans of the prior book and also a good title for reluctant readers.<br /><br />May The Odds Be Ever In Your Favor!
B002SF9YUM|4.0|Film I heard about, but was not able to see in the theater here since it never showed here, only in select theaters.  What a shame.  I ordered it hoping it would be good, it is. A good movie, a pleasure to watch.  All the actors excellent, no mis steps. Robert Pattinson playing a quirky,young,outsider - Dali(not the deliberate studied eccentric of later eras).  Beautiful, lush camera work and compelling story.  Meet Garcia Lorca, Dali, Bunuel, Gala, et al.
B003M96VU4|5.0|I have to admit, I was skeptical about the Vampire Diaries because I thought it was going to be another teeny-bopper soap opera, but I was pleasantly surprised. I LOVE IT. I'm addicted!
B000NIVJHM|4.0|I didn't use to love this movie. I found it to be overrated. But upon reviewing years later, all grown up, I find that it's not as bad as I originally thought. What gets me is the Johnny/Baby relationship. Whenever they aren't dancing or in bed, it looks like she's just a little kid pining for him and he doesn't want to actually be around her. It's a weird tandem, that actually ends up taking the viewer out of the viewing experience. Penny's character always kind of grated on me as well, especially the way she speaks.  Overall though, it's a very interesting movie that is easy to watch, has some very sexy love scenes and great dance scenes. I'd say though that it's not appropriate for younger kids, although I think alot of young kids have been allowed to see this.  P.S. The ending is just movie magic :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its great.  ;) I love it.several games that never get old. highly recommended .only thing is the graphics are not 100% &quot;hd&quot;

B004ZJZPXO|5.0|The feel of Firefly is not lost in this movie, it ties up some ends and still makes you wish the show was on TV. It explains a major part of the story in the last 20 minutes and makes you dislike the alliance even more.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a wonderful game if your looking for something fun, exciting, and free. The only thing about this game is that there are a bunch of popups and it freezes from time to time. Other than that its a great game.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Other reviewers have gone way more in depth and with much more eloquence than I ever could about this microphone.  I won't even try to match it.  However, I will give you the best info you will need on a Canon DSLR with manual audio control.<br /><br />Turn on the microphone.  Plug it into the camera.  Set the top switch on the microphone to the high pass filer setting.  Set the bottom swtich to +20 dB.  Turn the camera on.  Go into the audio settings and switch them to manual.  Set it to the lowest setting possible, then increase it four notches.<br /><br />You're welcome.<br /><br />Seriously, out of the box, you're going to get a notable hiss (like in all Canon DSLR footage) and you're going to think this only adds slightly to your footage audio.  If you use these settings, they are the best, and recommended from Rode (though not in the manual).<br /><br />I actually made a video reviewing the mic and all the settings therein.  In the video you can hear exactly what kind of output you get from each setting.  You be the judged.  As Amazon video reviews are 100MB or less, and mine is larger, and as they don't allow YouTube links, all I can say is to search YouTube for Alfeetoe and find my Videomic Pro review.<br /><br />Hope this helps and streamlines the setup process a bit.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie was very well written and performed...definitely puts more into perspective on the sad history of our Lord. Very good movie, I suggest using it to keep you on track with your faith and showing your children at the appropriate age to help make sure this is all understood.
1592332803|1.0|I bought this cookbook a while back based on the fabulous reviews. I was REALLY disappointed! Almost all of the recipes look like they were just modified from non-vegan recipes by replacing eggs with egg replacer. Every single thing I made from this cookbook was dry and low on flavor! I don't know if people just expect vegan baked goods to taste like cardboard so they aren't disappointed when they do, but I pride myself on making things that make people go \\"Wait-- this is VEGAN?!\\" This cookbook will have them saying: \\"This is vegan, isn't it?\\" In that not so nice way you never want to hear. Any Vegan cookbook by Moskowitz/Romero has better baked goods than this.

0385535139|4.0|I have mixed feeling about this book. I both understand the 3 star ratings and 5 star ratings. I would give this a 3 star comparing to his earlier novels like 'The Firm', 'The Last Juror'. 'The Litigators' is definitely not a legal thriller, but an entirely different per se. No plot or suspense  but still entertaining and interesting enough to keep reading. I would/did not loose sleep though, which I did on 'The Firm'. I liked the Wally Figg character. I even now chuckle on his, 'oh!,wonder of Krayoxx' dialogue.  When compared to those mediocre authors whose books always starts with a murder, I like the versatility of Grisham and so I wait for his book. This book is better than 'The Confession'.  So, between 3 and 5, I would rate this 4. Means I recommend this book for an entertainment read at leisure.
B005FITIGO|5.0|\\"Margin Call\\" is an impressive feature debut by director J.C. Chandor, who also wrote the film, drawing on the experiences of his friends and of his father, who was a trader at Merrill Lynch as his son was growing up. This film follows the turmoil inside a New York investment bank in 2008, over a period of about a day, as the bank's executives learn that their holdings of mortgage-backed securities are well outside acceptable volatility bands, a situation that could wipe out the bank's entire value if it doesn't unload the securities first. Chandor seems to draw on the recent histories of Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs in constructing this fly-on-the-wall drama of critical events in the biggest crisis in Wall Street history.<br /><br />Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), analyst at a New York investment bank, finishes work on a risk analysis project that his recently laid-off boss, Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), had begun. Alarmed by what he finds, Peter asks his friend Seth (Penn Badgley), a junior analyst, and the Head of Trading Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) to come in after hours to take a look. The company's holdings of mortgage-backed securities have become disturbingly volatile, which, combined with excessive leverage, will soon put the bank's very existence at risk. Sufficiently frightened by Peter's numbers, Will calls the man in charge of the floor, Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey), who in turn calls his boss and on up the chain to CEO John Tuld (Jeremy Irons), who must decide whom and what to save.<br /><br />John Tuld is obviously inspired by Dick Fuld, former CEO of Lehman Brothers. His actions resemble some of the speculation about Goldman Sachs' behavior in 2008. The film is almost voyeuristic in its perspective on how these people act in crisis. There are a variety of personalities at the bank, most of whom are going to lose their jobs one way or another. I imagine that different audiences will take different things away. I found \\"Margin Call\\" generally sympathetic toward the bankers, traders, and analysts. It does not address how they got into this predicament, which is where their real failure lies. It focuses on how they get out of it -but without explaining that they have little choice but to act in the interest of shareholders, even if they weren't averse to destroying themselves.<br /><br />These men have only bad choices. They can either do something that looks an awful lot like fraud, or they can wipe out their shareholders, burden the taxpayer, and freeze the credit markets, creating countless more casualties. J.C. Chandor could have been harder on them, and he could have been more sympathetic. By choosing a middle road, he may leave a large part of the audience unsatisfied. I admire him for being authentic rather than dogmatic, though. Seth acts as a kind of tour guide for the audience. A junior analyst in his first job and first crisis, he keeps asking people how much money they make. I enjoyed the compelling characters and dialogue and the look behind the scenes. And, far from profligate itself, \\"Margin Call\\" was made for an amazing $3.5 million.<br /><br />The DVD (LionsGate 2012): Bonus features include 2 deleted scenes with commentary, several short items, and an audio commentary. \\"Revolving Door: Making Margin Call\\" (6 min) interviews the director and cast about the script and its structure -the film follows one piece of information as it moves up the chain of command. \\"Missed Calls: Moments with Cast & Crew\\" (1 min) is some very brief behind the scenes footage. \\"From the Deck: Photo Gallery\\" (4 min) is a slide show of production stills.

B006UG909U|5.0|Fair Warning! Pun Intended, and if you didn't get it, just stop here...But if you did, and for some reason you haven't purchased this disc. First off get it now, and secondly; I will provide a little insight from a fan's perspective.   This review is overwhelmingly positive. I love `A Different Kind Of Truth'. I gush and go on and on about it. If your favorite Van Halen tunes are `Jump' `Dance the Night Away', or `I'll Wait' then `A Different Kind Of Truth' isn't gonna give you much reason to `Jump' for joy. Pun intended, bad as it was... However the Van Halen clan and Roth obviously know what all us diehards have always known, which is, as much as I'm sure they enjoyed having you along to propel them into the pop stratosphere where only Michael Jackson and Madonna competed with them for the top spot, you aren't the reason they are back almost thirty years later. We are. The diehards, the deep cut lovers. We prefer our Van Halen mean, synister and fun. We prefer Fair Warning or Women and Children First to 1984 where, dispite some killer tracks like `Girl Gone Bad', `House Of Pain' and `Drop Dead Legs', we all agreed they went soft. (Ok, admittedly I Love everything on 1984, but I'm trying to make a point here. As Dave says, let's stay focused here...)   What's truly amazing is that they didn't pander to you, (though a case can be made that, `Tattoo' was released first to appease you guys) and instead chose to reward us diehards, their true core audience, bringing back every single thing we ever loved about Van Halen. What's even more amazing is that they did it so well. It's all in there, every bombastic beat, every ridiculous trademark lick, every identifiable element of the VH we all love so dearly and kept us hoping against hope that the boys would pull their heads out of their collective asses long enough to do it one more time. That they did it so creatively is sort of mind boggling, and while they did roll out all things classic VH, they added plenty new to the equation. `Honeybabysweetiepie' is heavier than anything they've ever recorded save maybe `I'm On Fire', and it certainly doesn't sound like any other tune in the cannon, owing more to Living Colour's Stained than any other identifiable influence. We've heard Motorhead do it for four decades, but Van Halen has never laid waste to horn throwing metal stomp quite the way they do on `As Is'.   That's not to say there's nothing here for more casual fans. `The Trouble With Never' `Blood And Fire', (a song only VH could pull off with any sincerity that calls to mind that old school good vibe summer night vibe of perhaps, `Little Guitars'), and `You And Your Blues' find those poppier leanings (and the required harmonies) for those who require a little less subtlety in their hooks. But be warned, even those tunes are darker, less obvious and harder rocking than you might want, but we like `em just fine. If `She's The Woman' doesn't make you wanna shout along, then I don't suppose anything ever does. And thank the maker there's not a ballad to be found anywhere. If that didn't make you stop reading, than grab a cup of something and let's get to it. Let's talk about Van Halen's return. And what a return it is...   First. Let's get this outtatheway...   For those who seem to be wanting for Michael Anthony's voice in the background, I'd suggest giving another listen to these tunes. If I cared to I might be able to note the difference, but I certainly wouldn't classify it as any sort of drop off. The Wolf does just fine. Then again, in my humble opinion, digging VH for the harmonies is comparable to buying a Lamborghini for the low profile tires. No doubt important, and even very cool, but NOT the deciding factor in driving such a machine, and ultimately too goofy a notion to spend much time pondering. If you disagree, then you probably belong in the Van Hagar camp. I say head on back to camp now, cause there's nothing on this disc that's going to assuage your indignation. Sojust go throw on Chickenfoot III and forget all about this disc... the way we've all forgotten about any disc since 1984 with a Van Halen logo on it's cover. I would also suggest that the real reason Wolfgang is in and Michael Anthony is out is to be found in the playing. If Michael A. ever played anything remotely near the same postal code Wolf resides, I've never heard it. `China Town' and the afformentioned `The Trouble With Never', feature the kind of unison Bass/Guitar attack, dodge and parry that we heard on Roth's first full length Solo disc from Sheehan and Vai, and I simply don't believe Anthony is capable of it. Were it 1986 and he was nixed in favor of Eddies son, I might have been more insensed. Alas it isn't, and I'm not. He shall now be referred to as Wolfgang, or simply Wolf. He's earned it. He's all grow'ds up now, and `Wolfy' ain't gonna cut it. VH finally has a Bass player just as badass as it's guitarist and drummer... Besides that, who would begrudge a father wanting to play with his son in a band bearing their family crest? Espescially when the kid can flat out plaaaay. (Not buying the conspiracy theorist notion that Ed played the Bass tracks. Check out the `She's A Woman' clip from the Cafe' Wha Show, the kids got the family gene)  Not me, but I guess there are those who do. It's their loss, not Van Halen's, and not ours. That said, if a new Bassist wanted to be a great Rock player, I'd hand him this album and tell him, or her, to learn it end to end, and when they could play it cold, they'd be good to go.   Now I won't spend much time on Sammy. Comparing the two incarnations is maybe the most perfect example of `Apples and Oranges' ever observed. That said, those who weild the `Hagar is a far better singer' arguement like some sort of `Check Mate' killing stroke, have always missed, and are still missing the point completely. So was Pavaratti, but I wouldn't have wanted to hear him front Van Halen. Sammy said his piece. Airing the dirty laundry to bolster his profile, and inflate his bank account. Good for him. Hope he enjoyed the low road. In hindsight though, his story feels more like a frat boy kicking a homeless man. And seeing as Eddie has apparently gotten himself together, located his misplaced crown, and made a killer comeback. Ol' good guy Sam looks a little less like a good guy. I'm guessing we won't hear much from Sam for a while. I'm still down with Mike though. Seems like a good guy.    But enough of that. Back to the return of the kings that is, `A Different Kind Of Truth'. There are folks who seem to find some disappointment, and even comfort, that `Truth' may not replace any of the first six disc as a personal favorite. Again, I feel for them. No band has ever overcome the legendary iconic masterpieces of their best work thirty years later. Not the Stones, Not McCartney, Not Robert Plant, Not U2, Not Springsteen, Not... well you get the point. Neither has any artist created a piece that will so proudly stand right along side those Masterpieces, not the way Van Halen has. Not like this. Matter of fact, I'm not sure `Truth' isn't indeed a Masterpiece in it's own right. Hard to say, I'll have to listen to it for the next thirty years to know for sure. Furthermore it may be the most consistent and therefore best disc they've ever done. Crazy right? I know, at first it may seem so, but consider at thirteen tracks it's almost a double album by VH standards, and there's not one `throwaway'. You won't find a `Big Bad Bill', `Happy trails' ` Intruder', `1984' `Sunday Afternoon In The Park', or `Tora, Tora' padding the tracklist here. No covers. Just thirteen fully realised tracks, one just as killer as the next. Come to think of it, that may be the one thing I miss on this record... I always loved that kind of spice.   Oh settle down. I hear ya shouting `What about Tattoo!?'. Here is where I'm solidly in the minority perhaps. Side Bar please...Really? Years of songs like `Don't Tell Me What Love Can Do, The Dream Is Over, Finish What Ya Started, Right Now for god's sake... And Tattoo does nothing for ya? Really? Can you see my Deniro face over here? Well to my ear, `Tattoo' is simply that hooky, timely, poppier,  Van Halen perfectly reintroducing VH to the masses. We could argue the merits of that approach, but frankly it did everything it was supposed to do. Honestly, I dig it...not that you care, and rest assured I'm not concerned that you don't, but it is heaven to my ears. Catchy, and yeah, pretty fitting in this day and age. I find it hard to believe that so many missed the sentiment with, ya know, everybody getting all tatt'd up. I think it's a really smart take on a cultural phenomenon, with a kill groove to boot, and miles above frickin' `Jump'... but yeah, I dug `Jump' too. Which only has nostagligia and our innocense to give it an edge...`Mousewife to momshell in the time it took to get that new tattoo'...Don't look now, but somehow Dave snuck poignancy into the mix, and hits the nail on the damn head. If you don't get it, you will someday. Take my word for it. Side Bar done...   I've never had a problem with acts reaching broader audiences with easier digested cuts. I like seeing shows in arenas. It's an experience like nothing else, and only an option for acts that lots of folks wanna buy tickets for. I like small intimate shows too, and see a lot of them as most acts dear to my heart now play places that hold a thousand  people. But I hope I never see VH there. If it takes a `Tattoo` or `Jump' to assure they'll be on the big stage with the big sound, I'm down. Why do you think Dave Grohl is recording warmed over nonsense like `Learning to Walk'? But did you see that last Tour? Worth a little obviousness huh? One of the best shows I've seen...   So how about the meatier offerings...well, that's everything else on this disc. If you love the barely controlled,  yell it out, boogie if you can keep up romp of `Hot For Teacher' `Truth' is a testamentthat there's plenty more where that came from. `As Is' simply blows off the doors, and you might think twice about playing it anywhere near glass. `China Town' jumps you in, welcoming you to one of those communities Dave was visiting when he wrote `Mean Street'. Meanwhile `Outta Space', while goofy in the way anything is that ties itself to sci-fi imagery,  revs it up like they did on `Atomic Punk', not particularly melodic, or tuneful. But allowing the VH men to let lose like only they can. Answering the question, `What do you get when you add more Van Halen?', the answer of course... `More Van Halen', and when it's THIS Van Halen, that ain't a bad thing. When Dave tells the visiting whatever to `Go home, the earth is full' , don't be surprised if you find yourself mentally hollering `Yeah Mother F*&^%ers!'...`Bullethead' is the defintion of Metal Cool. Remeber when Metal was cool? Best song about road rage ever! `Buh buh buh buh buh buh bullethead'. Come On! I won't dissect everything. Suffice it to say If you can't get down with those tunes. Buddy, you can't get down.   Yeah, they pulled out old demos for half the albums tunes. That anyone would take exception to that is beyond my comprehension, which admittedly may not be what it once was. After hearing the results I wish more gereatric acts would consider the tactic, and you probably will too. Or maybe the semantics just distract you from enjoying the end result. Do you prefer newer Aerosmith to their classic 70's output? Hmm. It ultimately says more about you than the band if you do, and the same could be said about `Truth'. Case in point, the Stones last great record, `Tattoo You' was made up of leftovers cobled together from their 70's output. Just sayin'. In the end, I couldn't care less how these thirteen tunes were born, or when, just as long as I have `em to enjoy. And oh yeah... It totally worked.   Some tunes sound like brothers to classics. `Big River' had to have came to Eddie in the same wave of inspiration as `Runnin' With The Devil'. I got no problem with that, and if you do, again, it says more about you than them. Namely you don't love VH the way we do. Which is ok with me, but why are you still reading this? Your mind was made up already.... `Beats Workin' mines the same vein that yielded, `So This Is Love' and perhaps even their it's so much better than the original I've never listened to the original again version of `Where Have All The Good Times Gone' and is the perfect closer to the disc.   If you love the VH for the drumming, I sure do, then you won't be disappointed either. Alex is present and accounted for, in a way he hasn't been for almost three decades now. I mean, I could go on and on, pointing out time spots to check out in every single tune for examples of his supreme badassadry (Now a word), but this review is too long by far already so I won't. (OK, I'll give you one ... Head for the two minute mark in `China Town' listen to that prechorus that launches Eddies Solo. Awesome....) Rest assured, he sounds as nimble and powerfully bombastic as he ever has. Which, at his age, is simply almost uncomprehendable. Just as head scratching as Jagger careening around the stage for two and a half hours on the last Stones tour. It just doesn't make sense. His limb independance, hang tight while us drummers talk for a moment, is astounding and effortless just like you remember, and how he can play this tastefully while creating so much of a hurricane defies all logic. Listen to his Ride work during that Eddie Solo in `China Town'. Now go try it...See? His playing on `Truth' reminds me why I kept picking up those sticks when I was still light years away from being able to use `em the way he does. I've gotten a light year or two closer in the decades since, but he is still just flat out inspiring. I feel like I'm twelve again, sitting at the foot of the Master. If he's underrated I don't know how. Only Bonham cast a shadow as long as his in the Rock and Roll Universe.   As for Eddie? Eddie is still the king, and he brings all the tools in his considerable belt to this fight. For me, and for a whole bunch of folks, there's Eddie, and then there's everyone else. (  I might argue that about Van Halen as a band if pressed, but then you'd think I had no perspective. Trust me, I love a bunch of other bands) Yep, Vai may be techinically better, Satch may be more fluid. What has always set Eddie apart isn't his soloing, which people will still be dissecting at the end of the world be it in ten months or ten thousand years, or even the cacauphony of random sounds he can conjure up at any and every moment. It's his ability to do it within the context of a song and somehow make it oh so listenable and enjoyable. Lyrical even.There's no logical reason for his playing to be so pleasing to the ear. It could easily sound like nails on a chalkboard, and yet it never does. It's a bit of a universal mystery really. It's all on display here. Some folks say he hasn't moved the ball forward with `Truth' to which I would respond; when you run it back for a touchdown, the only thing left is to do it again. No, he doesn't have the `Never heard this before' angle to attack from anymore, but that's because he already hit us from every angle. If this somehow takes away from your enjoymeant of hearing him weild that arsenal one more time, I simply don't know what to tell ya. Again, `your loss' is the only thing that springs to mind. That said, there are certainly a few new tricks to be found, and a few different tones than have been heard in the catalog so far. When he does pull out signature riffage, he uses it in different places than you'd expect. Revealing how much thought went into this baby. When he gives a nod to what passed for rock guitar in the last twenty years , like on `Honeybabysweetiedoll', you can hear Nu-Metal dorks all over the world saying, `Damnit, that's how you're supposed to do it' ... It's all in the fingers, and his areaparently no worse for wear and tear. Astounding....(But if your looking for someone to reinvent the wheel, may I suggest Radiohead. A band I dig for sure. Have fun with that) Eddie already reinvented the wheel, and built the car to put it on. How many times does any one man do that in a lifetime. If this is your point of contention, I suspect you simply have the bar too high on everything in life. You must be very disappointed in ... well everything I guess.   But let's face it. The reason this disc got the attention it has is because of the return of Roth. Not to say that he's the reason it's as good as it is. Or maybe to say exactly that. Consider this. The Hagar years were full of great playing by the brothers Van Halen... the problem was Sammy. As genericly solid as his singing was, no better than an American Idol contestant if only for being so unmemorable, it was his writing that was the problem, along with his drunk guy singing kareokee delivery. Aww Shucks only goes so far... He simply lacks the cleverness to turn a decent phrase. That is what sets song lyrics apart from any random converstion. Example; `How do you know when it's love? I don't know, but it last forever', and of course `Hey Baby', which he has got to give credit for to the Big Bopper. He simply lacked the lyrical mustard, or delivery to throw a saddle on the wild mustang that is Van Halen's sound without getting thrown off. Roth on the other hand can ride that beast the full eight seconds...and yeah, that's certainly a huge factor in the success of this effort.   Dave and Eddie are the Bullets and the Gun, switching roles as to which depending on where we are in the song. Which one kills you kind of misses the point. Roth sings, wether you call it that or not, with the attitude, energy and spontanuity (the oops missed it last `Tattoo' on that last verse just kills me. And the gri-gri of him asking for more of him in the headphones in the breakdown of `As Is', that's the stuff!) that perfectly matches Eddie's genius, and he still has plenty of all of the above. Like a translator for visiting royalty, he clarifies, and personifies what they are saying musically the way that apparently only he can. Say what you will, something about him and Ed's chemistry sparks the best in everyone. The meaning ain't the point. The sentiment is.    `Stay Frosty' might be the best example of pure Rothism ever, his particular brand of carny act, the way `Ice Cream Man' was until now. And yep, they are different versions of the same song, but nostalgia aside, `Stay Frosty' might be better. ..And yes, it was intentional. `Ice Cream Man'....`Stay Frosty'... Get It? Write it down... try to keep up. `Don't want `em to get your goat? Don't show `em where it's hid.', then soon after, `Here, you can use my hand, I won't look...Uuuh Ooh'..Elsewhere, `There's a trick to christian values, and it's compulsory'  and later, `Far and wide, far as you ramble, trust in allah, but tie up your camel'. Hehehehe.. ahhh. Good stuff. Anyway, if you take no pleasure from hearing that trick one more time, which is precisely the second time they have pulled it out, then just stop. Forget it, you don't like VH...move on. The rest of us, we're gonna go berzerk when the band fires in on that bad boy boogie.. ...If you love VAN HALEN... You're gonna love this. If you don't, you won't... If your disappointed. My lord, what more did you want? What could you possibly have been expecting, and how could you possibly have expected it?!  And why are you so sad?   The lyrical gems are all over `Truth', `Listen to a seashell, you can hear the sea. Listen to a beer mug, that river belongs to me'- `God is love, but get it in writing'- `With a Chevy for my summer home, let's get the party started. Looks like the city towed my other apartment'- `God must love the lazy, shiftless and the crazy, he put so many in line' - `Honeybaby my hearts aflame I'm all...And you're to blame'. Don't know logically what all that means, but my heart knows and beats a little faster like an unborn baby responding to it's father's voice in the womb. `I say love `em all, let cupid sort `em out'. How has nobody said that before?!   Where was I? Oh yeah, Roth...Yep, or rather nope, his range ain't what it used to be, and the train whistle is nowhere to be heard... although how he ever did that is still fun to ponder, but it's hardly a deal breaker, at least not for me, and if you're still reading, probably not for you. `She's the Woman' has all the swaggar and bravado needed to make you throw your hand in the air and shout along, unless your the one I was talking about way up at the top of this near monstrous novel of a review. And the real appeal of Roth, what was missing without him, is found heading into that song's second chorus where he informs us that `the song aint dirty, it's really just the way we sing it', again, clever in case you forgot what that sounds like, then in the background he invokes the Muppet's Animal questioning first `Sing it?', then deciding YES, shouting `SING IT'. He also deserves a bit more credit than he's given. He's not just clever, he's actually smarter than the average bear. I've read where some didn't get the lyrics on the next tune I'm talking about (To you I say go do some research. The roots of all this stuff are a hundred years old, and you've missed a bunch) `You and Your Blues', where he thoughtfully quotes classic Blues songs and lines to illustrate that he's a pretty happy dude, all fed up with his girl's inability to look on the damn bright side before hollering `Woman, you suffer from a color'... Blues...Get it? If the song doesn't strike a chord with you, I envy, and sort of hate you, but for lots of men out there, and I imagine some ladies, the sentiment is gonna hit home. Nice of him to get it off our chest. I'll go back to `As Is' to really drive the point home. As the tune fades out with Eddie sliding around the neck like a rhythmic serpent over Alex's gallop and Wolf's low end machine-gun cannonballs, Roth, seemingly at a loss for words after all that pure rock and roll exhilaration, simply sings, and I quote, `La La La La, La La La Laaaa La', and for whatever reason only the gods know, it makes perfect sense.That kind of sums it all up... `As he states after the first chorus, `That's how it go'. This is what Roth brings to the table. Really the only comparison you can make with his personna is the Joker, specifically. The Dark Knight's Heath Ledger portrayal. Throughout the disc, Roth makes evident his lust for life, even if he's now taken a punch or two, the likes of which he hadn't yet while recording the first six discs. The weariness hasn't dulled him though. If anything it only heightens his sense of `Get it while you can' bravado. On the more menacing tunes it's not hard to imagine him asking us all as a collective, `Why so serious', and then slashing us wide open with a switchblade. Take another listen to that halftime breakdown in `The Trouble With Never'. I mentioned earlier...   Look, that kind of stuff either does it for you or it doesn't. Somewhere along the line, seems the world forgot that rock and roll was meant to be fun. Hip Hop/Rap never forgot, and I'm pretty sure that is what pulled more recent generations to it. Roth has come to reclaim his territory, and despite his aging chords he manages to do just that.   Hopefully, no one is interested in deciding who deserves more credit. The fact is, Van Halen is another example of the whole being greater than the sum of it's parts, despite those considerably talented parts. It's all of them - together, that makes the magic happen. No point in jealousy, or whatever it was that drove them apart, ruining what they are - together. Only Roth gives a frame of reference for what Eddie does, and without the Van Halens providing the context, Roth is just a lunatic spewing nonsense. So here's hoping they get together at least one more time to give us another collection of songs. More old ideas, new ones, whatever, as long as it's the real Van Halen, I'll wait.   Sorry...couldn't resist.    Another real testament to the time and focus they brought to this project are the arrangements. More Van Halen's time than Roth's I'm guessing, but who knows? They're surprising but not overthought. Making it sound and, more importantly, feel like VH is a living beast that you somehow managed to jump on back of for a few minutes as it charged swayed and stopped dead, only to take a step or two before taking off again. The haftime section in `Trouble With Never' is but one example, and a mild one. Other tunes showcase changes in time signature and jazz scales that add to the uniqueness of those tunes and make a case that if anything, they're actually better musicians now. The songs are cinematic. But then the best VH always was. `Tattoo' is indeed the most conventional arrangement to be found. As are most Radio minded tunes, but nothing else follows the standard formula of song construction. Oh, it's not Prog Rock by any means, but they take care to throw in curves and U turns that are sure to reward as time goes on. Guess what I'm trying to say is, these are well crafted songs that reward with repeated listenings, but what fun is that?   To summarize I will quote the beloved portrayal of a musical legend on film. `The Legend of Dewey Cox'.  Taken from the the scene where old Dewey hangs with the Beatles. Not sure which one said it first, Paul or John... but it says it all.   `Ggrrrllleeaat Recooorrd'   That's more than I hoped for...   It's a different kind of truth, but it's the truth nonetheless, and the truth will set you free, the way only Van Halen ever could!

0307346617|5.0|I feel like Max Brooks deserves a lot of credit for re-launching the zombie fiction novel.  His use of vignettes from multiple perspectives is provides the most original and creative take on zombie fiction that I've ever had the pleasure of reading.  He manages to create a global picture of the zombie apocalypse, one that encompasses years of action and leaves the reader with a picture of the world before, during and after Armageddon.  I for one cannot wait for the the film.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|I've known about PJ Harvey for a long time, but never have I taken to time to listen to her music.  I'm a Nick Cave fan though, so her duet and other musical contributions to him are familiar to me.  Seeing this album on a few 10 Best lists and her winning The Mercury Prize for this was enough to get my attention.  This album has become an instant favorite of mine and I would definitely agree it is a cohesive album worth listening to as a whole work.  In this day and age, it's a rarity to find a full album you can say is a work of art.  This is one of them.  My only complaint is tracks 10 and 11, while good songs, somehow break up the incredible pace and I feel the need to usually skip them.  Still, I'm giving 5 stars because even with this one gripe, this is still an AMAZING record.  Now I have a lot more PJ Harvey to explore.  Highly recommended.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  I was a little worried about the new album when I heard Tattoo, but this is one awesome album.  First of all, it's heavy, like Women and Children First heavy, which I love.  However, it almost feels like this is the next step from 1984 without the keyboards.  Eddie is on fire on this album, his solos are wild and flawless while Alex pounds through songs like John Bonham (he's IMO, the best ROCK drummer since Bonham, his sound, his playing, I love it).  The bass is higher in the mix than other VH albums which is a good thing and Wolf sounds like a very competent player and does a fine job replacing Michael Anthony (though I wish his vocals were still there).  DLR can't yelp and reach some of the high notes like he used to, but he was never really a great singer anyway, he just had the \\"it\\"  factor which he once again brings to the table.  Roth brings that swagger we've been missing with the other singers.  The production is excellent on the album too.  It's not over-compressed like most songs today.  The mix is simply perfect as I can hear everything, drums, bass, guitars, vocals just how it should be.  This is a must-have rock album!  Van Halen is back like a bull out of the gates to prove that rock is back!!!
B006OAB3ME|2.0|I like Diana Krall's twist on pop standards - mostly produced by Tommy LiPuma - very much and without knowing about the backround of this album, my first listen to \\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" really gave me this idea. However, I am afraid that the effort has gone wrong. Sir Paul's vocals are in incomparably worse shape than on the album I last heard from him (the excellent \\"Chaos and Creation In the Backyard\\"/2005). This breathy, panting singing pretty much ruins the whole thing. It is really a pity, since the mood and cooperation on the set must have been excellent and the work quite possibly was a labor of love. Still, the eventual effect may be that only die-hard Macca fans will snap this album up. For most others, disappointment will ensue... Given the still rather good voice of Paul Simon's on his last year's album (Simon is even some months older than Paul McCartney), this is a great pity. Besides, Paul McCartney's version of the tunes like \\"Paper Moon\\" would have by no means ended up among the best ever - since their style does not even suit him well.  As a rarity - OK. But as a lasting work of art - I fear not...
B0064J6OMO|5.0|This movie was hilarious! I loved it, Jason and Ryan really good match up. I've watched it over ten times and still laugh really hard. The people who wrote bad and lousy reviews are crazy! I now own it and would be upset if I lost it.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|Good addition to Coolpix P7000 and P7100.  Light alternative to SB-600 in larger cameras when travelling.  1/3 the size of SB-600, fits into pocket.  Be careful with Sunpak flash units.  I have a Sunpak PF30XN Digital SLR Camera Dedicated i-TTL Flash for Nikon (DigiFlash) that works with my D7000 but not with my Coolpix P7000.  Sunpak does not guarantee compatibility with Nikon.
B006P0FIGU|5.0|I loved this movie, mostly for the cinematography and costumes (silver-buckled shoes, capes, etc.), but also because it was very entertaining and lovable -- though i was rather disappointed with the two instances of foul language (the \\"s\\" word is said twice). But other than that, it is quite adorable and exciting.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This album is a scorcher from start to finish. Obviously now we know why there is a train on the front. This muther will run over anything in its path. I have no complaints. The guys sound terrific and the songs are great. We can only hope that they have put all of their past differences aside and that this lineup will be entertaining us for many more years. I hope this album foreshadows greater things to come, not only for VH, but for rock music in general. Congratulations guys, you nailed it!
B0012IWHDW|5.0|* This is a review of the European Sony/Columbia CD 32098  (Bar code 5 099703 209822)<br /><br />Unfortunately a lot of (Country/Cowboy) music lovers may miss out on this one because Bob Dylan's name is on the cover, and they just can't begin to imagine how wonderful Bob Dylan sounds when he's in \\"country mode\\".<br /><br />Some Bob Dylan lovers may pass it by because there are only a few Dylan songs on this soundtrack recording.<br /><br />I held back from purchasing this gem on CD, guessing sooner or later Columbia/Sony would eventually issue a remaster - but no need to worry on that score as this version of the CD sounds as brilliant as I remember the original LP/vinyl issue.<br /><br />Musically it's loaded with Cowboy Movie atmosphere, a little bit of Country rock, a little bit of very tasty acoustic guitar playing, a few appropriate songs from Bob Dylan about Billy The Kid & Pat Garrett, including the astonishing \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\".<br /><br />Sounding as fresh now as it did back in the early 70s, this entire recording is short and sweet, just like Bob's \\"Nashville Skyline\\".<br /><br />Listening pleasure guaranteed!<br /><br />Musicians include Booker T., Roger McGuinn, Bruce Langhorn, Russ Kunkel, Byron Berline, Jim Keltner & Carl Fortina.<br /><br />Always on sale at Amazon, and at a very nice price, there really is no excuse for not getting hold of a copy of this.<br /><br />\\"Pat Garrett got your number.....\\"<br /><br />Classic.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This is a return to form. Ranks right up there with their debut, as well as Women And Children First and Fair Warning. The longest album of Van Halen's career is also one of their best. \\"Tattoo\\" is probably out of place being on this album, which certainly threw me. Once \\"She's The Woman\\" kicked in I was hooked. Yes, they went back into the archive and pulled out old, unused material and reworked it... and it sounds great! You're getting classic VH here.

1594744769|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. I'm 26 and have read over 200 books. It is a disservice to this incredible book to categorize it solely as \\"young adult\\" fiction. I was just telling my wife this is going to be the next big thing, probably get a movie, and will have a sequel book. Guess what I just read on ransomriggs.com? It's getting a movie by \\"Fox\\", directed by Burton, and there is a sequel in the works. I was so glad that my guesses were right.<br /><br />This is the next Harry Potter and Hunger Games. Read it now.<br /><br />Every review I've read, plus the book jacket description, plus the cover art completely under-sells how stellar the writing is. It was no surprise to me when I found out that Ranson Riggs, like me, writes screeplays. This things flows like a movie. What a spectrum of emotions! Of introspection! The story-telling basic of creating and developing satisfying set-ups and payoffs! What big choices the protagonists has to face in the end! Brilliant. A book worthy of the glowing responses often thrown about all too carelessly. Read this now and be one of the people who said \\"yeah, i read it before the wave swept the nation.\\" It's freakin' coming.<br /><br />9.5/10 novel. Congrats, Riggs. Congrats.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|Eddie - You are peerless.  I am as blown away by your virtuoso shredding on this album as ever I've been with any.<br />Alex - You are as dead bang on and bombastic as I remember, and coupled with Eddie make the electric energy of this album, undeniable.<br />David - You may have lost a bit of \\"punch\\" in your high range, but your humor and delivery pull this album together just as I had hoped it would.<br />Wolfie - you really have come into your own; your tightness and harmonies really round things out and hold their own against Michael.<br /><br />For those that would deny this is as good as Van Halen has ever been, you're not listening.  I know how I felt when each Van Halen album came out up to 1984.  It was electric, energizing, fun and each was a discovery unto itself.  This album is just the same.  Once again with Van Halen (as opposed to later Van Hagar), I'm losing myself in the wall of guitar and drums, laughing at Dave's delivery and commentary and most of all, happy inside for the \\"feel\\" of it.  The shredding guitar, bombastic drums distinct vocals and harmonies are all there.  Van Halen's back and I for one, wish them the absolute best on this upcoming tour; I hope it spurs on at least enough energy and creativity for them to follow this album up with at least 1 or 2 more....and not 28 more years from now.  For naysayers that claim Dave \\"sounds old\\" I say get over it.  Dave is older; he's bound to sound a bit different.  Guitar sounds and drums can be replicated, but I think he's aged quite well and in some ways, his delivery, while still classic Diamond Dave, is more honest than it's ever been.  This not to mention that it makes this album just what it should be...a banging follow-up to 1984 with amped up production values.  It's just a Dave with a couple of limitations.  Honestly, I don't think it detracts.  And for those purists that would claim, it's not Van Halen without Michael, well...I love and respect Michael and wish him the best, but Wolfie's holding his own.  He's tight with his uncle's drums, lending his own distinct harmonies to the mix and...after all, he's a Van Halen too.<br /><br />All in all, as the title of this review says: This is the one for which I've been waiting!  I think it's stands as strong or more strongly than a couple of the originals.  Thanks for making my week and reconnecting me with the great feelings of being excited and blown away by the release of a new Van Halen album.<br /><br />Now go have a great tour...and make a couple more!s tight with his uncle's drums, lending his own distinct harmonies to the mix and...after all, he's a Van Halen too.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Great documentary.  Very disturbing to think living in the USA this type of activity happens.  We should all be aware and educate ourselves on the food we eat, the products we use on our skin.  It's not what we eat it is what we absorb. Read labels.  Set priorities on using clean pure safe beneficial products in the marketplace today. Cheap is exactly that .... cheap and harmful to our bodies. I highly recommend watching this movie .... well worth it.

1594203334|5.0|This book is a lovely parenting book disguised as an engaging, imaginative memoir of a young woman raising her children in France. As far as I'm concerned (and I am merely a stay at home mom, not an accomplished critic) this is the end-all be-all of parenting books. Practical parenting advice is hidden amongst stories of meandering down enchanted cobblestone streets and the smell of fresh baguettes from the nearby bakery. I love that she gives her reader every reason to enjoy every moment of pregnancy and parenthood. This book is void of horror stories, anxiety, and legalistic rules but chock full of common sense and grace for mothers-to-be. I certainly wish I had read this book during my first pregnancy when I was a nervous wreck. If nothing else, peace has returned to my home via her no-nonsense parenting methods. Unlike other child-rearing and \\"what to expect\\" type books, after reading this, I am far less nervous about my potential to ruin my child for life.
B0064NTZQ2|2.0|Ok, were the writers on strike, did they lose all the dialog, are did they just want us to use the wonders of our imaginations when it came to filling in all the long pauses and dialog free stares at each other. As for the little bit of action there was; I do have to say it was decent but short lived.
0446614459|4.0|After reading Split Second I felt compelled to write my own review.  Since I've read nearly everything that Baldacci has written, I was so pleased learn how/why/when, the Sean King & Michelle Maxwell's relationship came into being. Baldacci has written an authentic page turner! I rate it at 4 stars as it has everything I've come to expect from Baldacci's ever twisting, curiously redirective yet cogent style of storytelling.  He didn't let me down! The reader is informed of some background, led on the adventure of our two former Secret Service Agents, all the while being given each of their personal motivations, and ultimately charging forward to bring our good guys near death but victorious.  Get into the heads of the characters! The elite trained secret service, the warped mind of the insane, the viewpoint of the witness and onto the eerie ride with all the switchbacks and and turns that are laid out before you. Enjoy this page-turning creation from the mind of a great writer. I most certainly did.

1452101248|3.0|This book is for you if:    -You are a vegetarian, vegan or would like to cook less meat since there are no meat or fish recipes in this book. Maybe 50% of the recipes are vegan.  -You are sick of eating pasta, pizza, and veggie burgers because there's only maybe a handful of these recipes.  -Are an intermediate cook that knows you need to boil something before you simmer it, and how to use your oven pretty well in case you need to explode an eggplant in the broiler.  -If you like the challenge of hunting down rare spices, ie. fresh curry leaves, persian limes, whole coriander seed, za'tar, somac, pink peppercorn. I ordered mine from the very affordable <...>  -If you like mediterranean, middle eastern style food.  -The food you will make will be highly presentable, though honestly not always tasty. Makes a great photo though.    Not for you:  -If you don't want a dozen spices in your kitchen that you will probably never use again.  -Are a starter cook. These recipes have long ingredient lists and often require maybe an hour or so in prep.  -Hate cilantro, I made the mistake of actually adding 2 cups of cilantro, and ending up throwing out the entire pot after 2 bites.    I give this cookbook mixed reviews because half the recipes just didn't taste good, and honestly that's inexcusable to me. While some were really good like the fried eggplant soba nooodle, it just didn't make up for the fact that some nights I had to recook dinner. I also had to make way too many adjustments, too much oil, too much butter, too much cilantro. This cookbook has made me realize I really don't like cilantro all that much (soba with wakame an utter disaster). Exactly where am I suppose to find fresh curry leaves and fresh kaffir. Give us a substitution please. I also found the recipes to be overly complex, I think the rice with cardamon can just stay on the stove, why bother putting it in the oven? Hell, the whole things could have been made in a rice cooker.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I'm in the middle of Lost City and am really enjoying it.  I do have one suggestion for authors though. On the map, let players tap on an already visited screen to go there instantly.  Having to navigate through numerous screens is drudge work.  Otherwise, great game!
0062073567|4.0|I've never been a huge fan of the \\"cozy\\" mystery, but in my rare ventures into that territory, I like to go with Agatha Christie, one of the biggest names in the genre.  What little I knew of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was it somehow controversial, which to me was a virtue.  Having now read the book, I can see where the controversy was at the time, but really, it is more cutting edge in a way I can't really discuss without spoiling things.  It is not, I hope, too much of a spoiler to say that this book has a character named Roger Ackroyd and he is indeed murdered.  Besides the normal police, the private investigator Hercule Poirot is called in to investigate.  Ackroyd was a wealthy but often miserly man, and his murder brings forth a number of suspects, all with their own motives.  The most suspicious in the bunch is his stepson Ralph Paton, who's disappeared shortly after the killing and stands to inherit a lot of money.  Of course, in most mysteries, the obvious suspect is rarely the actual culprit.  Poirot will slowly piece things together.  Narrating the tale, almost as a Watson to the Holmes-like Poirot, is the local doctor, James Sheppard.  Sheppard's nosy sister Caroline would serve as a precusor to Miss Marple, Christie's second most memorable character.  The most memorable is Poirot, who is featured in nearly half of Christie's 80 books (Marple is in only a dozen or so).  Like Sherlock Holmes, he is a brilliant but egotistical man with his share of affectations.  And like many detectives of the era (including more hard-boiled sorts like Philip Marlowe), he is essentially an outsider; he will never get really involved in the other characters' lives and at the end of the novel, he will no doubt leave them with genial ease.  This is a good book and would serve well as an introduction to both Christie and Poirot.  The bits of cleverness you may notice may seem not surprising now, but when this book was released, they were more special.  Even if you're not a big cozy mystery fan, this book still serves well for those who want to know the history of the mystery genre.

0765350386|1.0|This is one of those times where I glanced at the reviews and immediately grabbed the book. I mean, LOOK at all those five star reviews.<br /><br />For starters, despite Mistborn being touted by some as a \\"the bad guy wins\\" book, it is actually as generic as almost any other book using a dark lord. The only difference in this book is he isn't trying to reclaim power, only maintain it. Now, don't get me wrong the premise could be good fun, but the way it is conveyed is way too painful to truly enjoy.<br /><br />Now before I rip into the book, I should say It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish, only that I had to skim it during some of the tedious middle portions. Also, I was actually interested to learn about some of the mysteries- though that just made it more of a slap in the face when no effort is made to give them a resolution.<br /><br />The characters in the series are where I suppose, many of the problems ultimately stem from. We have Vin and Kelsier as the main characters. Despite being the most fleshed out, Vin was never ever slightly likable with her plethora of inner monologues and brother issues. Kelsier fared better, but still felt pretty generic and had too many lines and moments evidently made to force the reader to like him. The rest of the characters are vague, scarcely fleshed out shadows, with single attributes that define them. Unfortunately this is even the case for the lord ruler. Even after seeing the twist coming, I was pretty curious to find out about him, and sloshed through the mediocre filler antagonists to get to the end, only to find him as a very generic dark lord entity.<br /><br />I've heard Brandon speak, and he's an intelligent guy. He gives advice on showing rather than telling, and I expected quality closer to GRRM's work based on that. Yet he has a terrible habit of stating the obvious and never implying things. Sometimes it is needed, because the character reaction is so unbelievable you need to hear it from them, other times it is obvious but stated anyways.<br /><br />The pacing is also utterly terrible. Brandon clearly wanted to make a story about an epic uprising, but wasn't too clear on how to get to the actual uprising. We meet the characters and get some description of the world, before the plethora of training sections. The whole noble parties could have been fun, but dialogue and characterization is just so weak that everyone came across as copy pastes of stereotypes, especially Kliss who we meet for a second, then later on is abruptly an informer(which also doesn't go anywhere).<br /><br />Once the actual uprising occurs the pace goes from slow to wildly erratic, with random bursts of heroism, false flag deaths, sacrifices etc. But it is all cramped in such a close section, and glued together so poorly, the events are jagged and odd. The occurrences themselves are also very unbelievable, such as the event which sets off the uprising- which was very cliche, and spelled out immediately in the next chapter.<br /><br />All in all this book was just not there. Nothing felt truly inspired. Did I think it might have had potential? Sure, before there was any real dialogue. Were some parts cool? Well, not really but the fighting was interesting the first time. Would I recommend this? Absolutely not, unless your a fan of new magic systems in a bland setting.it is obvious but stated anyways.<br /><br />The pacing is also utterly terrible.

1451627289|5.0|This was my first Stephen King book, and it has definitely made me a fan. The book moves along at a quick pace and interesting action is always occurring. The best thing about this book is its cohesiveness. Oftentimes, with a book this long, there can be weird tangents or bits that seem out of place or out of relation to the rest of the story. Not so here - in fact, a major theme of the novel was the unity of time and events and I feel this theme was reflected through Mr. King's clear writing. While it's definitely long, a reader will fly through the book in no time.  I won't give a synopsis here, as I feel it will be repetitive of the many other reviews. But I definitely recommend this book for anyone who is looking for an engrossing page-turner, as well as anyone who is amused and entertained by the coincidences and synchronism of life.

B006NXIO0Q|5.0|Cataleya is a brilliantly realized character played to perfection by both the young Amandla Stenberg and later by Zoe Saldana.<br /><br />I sincerely loved how completely competent she was at getting away from people and at killing them.  And yet at the same time her thirst for revenge was slowly undermining her safety.<br /><br />The only problem I had with the entire movie was the love interest. I dislike the actor tremendously, always have, and the entire plot with him betraying her trust the way he did just infuriated me.<br /><br />The ending of the movie was perfection, however, and especially in the choice of music to go out on.

The app gives you a lot of control over your art and has multiple brushes and opacity settings that allow you to.blend textures and mix color. Not at all a had app, I'd even go as far as saying it's the best when it comes to drawing apps.  The latest update knocks the score down a star, however. I paid $2 for this, I could have kept the free version for doodling but I chose to invest in this app. Cause I believe!

B005IKZ60G|5.0|Guetta on this album far exceeds my wildest expectations for electronica.  Honestly, I'm more of a country-folksy type of listener, but I can't turn this album off from my MacBook. Each song is its own skillful composition, made by the clever layering of vocal tracks and electronic beats.  Some of my favorites from the album are the [[ASIN:B005IKZ73M I Just Wanna F. (Feat. Timbaland & Dev) [Explicit]]], which is a very catchy collaboration with Dev and Timbaland that sounds like one of those very seductive songs with its clean vocals and very thoroughly \\"frayed\\" (i.e. blurred, or less than clear) beats, [[ASIN:B005IX1T0E Where Them Girls At (Feat. Nicki Minaj & Flo Rida)]], which is one of those catchy songs that is played over and over again in the clubs which you should hate, but just can't bring yourself to do so (honestly, I've gotten more than a few stares just from the fact that I've shamelessly memorized the entire Nicki Minaj rap; it's just that catchy!), [[ASIN:B005IKZ6EW Turn Me On (Feat. Nicki Minaj)]], which is one of those songs with those hard, rough-n-ready club beats ready for the consumption.  Overall, this album somehow manages to woo me out of my typically [[ASIN:B0017PIADG Apple Tree]] style of music in lieu of a much more rough and electronic, and frankly, equally catchy, type of music.  Guetta on this album combines this skillful arranging skill, with the beauty of his featured artists, to help create a more whole composition of the album in general.
B006UG909U|4.0|The first new full studio album of any kind since 1998, and the first one with David Lee Roth since 1983.  It's been a bloody long time.  It does surprisingly well, all things considered.  First off, David Lee Roth is back, which brings with it an attitude that Van Halen never had with Gary Cherone or Sammy Hagar.  I liked the albums produced with both of those guys (some of the Hagar material is really epic).  However, the swagger, the attitude, and the \\"fun\\" that made up the original Van Halen was lost when Roth departed in the mid 80's.  That's finally back.<br /><br />However, an equally as large part of the pie is gone - Michael Anthony.  While he was probably never the best bassist out there, a much larger part of his contributions were his harmonizing vocals.  They made all the difference.  They're gone.  For a decent percentage, Dave harmonizes with himself.  Which isn't bad, but man - if Anthony was here, this would have rocked the house.  Oh, and I'm not saying Anthony is a bad bassist - he's quite good.  But he never ranks up there with the greatest ever.<br /><br />As for this album..  The single \\"Tattoo\\" was first out of the gate, and man, it's awful.  That they chose the worst song on the album to be the lead single, and the return of the Roth era VH is QUITE puzzling.  It's not like it's a truly BAD song, but if you took Tattoo and put it in the middle of the 1984 album, it'd be a \\"skip\\" track.  I was quite fearful for the rest of the album.<br /><br />Didn't have to be.  The thing kicks ass.  The backup vocals aside, the music in here is quite good.  Sounds an awful lot like Van Halen.  They went back to the beginning for inspiration - rumors are that half of the songs are based off of material from the pre first album era.  One is clearly a leftover (She's the Woman) from their 1976 demo track.  But it's not just that kind of feel.  There's numerous tracks that are worthy of singling out, so to save thise review from just listing track names and saying \\"That's aweome\\"..  My favorites early on are She's the Woman, China Town, As Is, Outta Space, & Stay Frosty.  But that's not to say the others aren't great.<br /><br />There's a great guitar sound after Roth's chrouses in Outta Space that has an odd sound that reminds me of the drill guitar sound from \\"Poundcake\\".  Stay Frosty reminds me (and everyone else from reviews) of Ice Cream Man.  I've seen people rag on them for that.  I rather like that, as Ice Cream Man is one of my all time favorite VH songs.<br /><br />But yeah - VERY VERY solid album.  I'm giving it four out of five stars - I'd give it five, but Michael Anthony isn't here.  It would have been out of the park with him on here.<br /><br />NOTE: I opted for the standard CD vs the [[ASIN:B006UG90RM Deluxe Edition]], as the Deluxe was just four songs played unplugged on a DVD.  I don't care for unplugged anyway, plus it was $5 more for the Deluxe vs just $10 for the regular.rites early on are She's the Woman, China Town, As Is, Outta Space, & Stay Frosty.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|This somewhat soapy, beautifully- produced and perfectly- cast series is fun, engrossing and frighteningly addictive. Already I suffering withdrawal and wondering how I'll possibly be able to wait months and months for Season 3.
B000002572|2.0|Now that the Superbowl XLVI is history, we won't have to hear old recordings of the band \\"Boston\\" on the radio or TV as much, which is worth thinking about.<br /><br />From a historic perspective, the emergence and subsequent crass commercial push behind \\"Boston,\\" the band's first album, was probably only equaled by \\"Frampton Comes Alive,\\" which eventually turned out to be a career killer for the creative guitarist Peter Frampton.<br /><br />As someone who searches through junk at Salvation Army and Goodwill thrift stores for forgotten treasures, I wouldn't be able to count the times I've run into copies of these two albums. Both of them were tremendously popular during their time, but they obviously ended up on someone's junk pile.<br /><br />\\"Boston\\" and \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" were pretty much the precursors of arena and glam rock, and inadvertently caused a backlash from the rock underground by the emergence of punk bands like the Ramones, Husker Du, the Dead Boys and so on.<br /><br />Although huge, huge megahits, neither \\"Boston,\\" or \\"Frampton Comes Alive,\\" found their way onto Rolling Stone's \\"500 Greatest Albums\\" list.<br /><br />There's a reason for that.<br /><br />On one hand, \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" was just a rehash of about four or five albums worth of studio recordings. It wasn't bad, it was just overdone, like a burnt weenie. On the other hand, \\"Boston\\" was a collection of rock cliches that were obsolete on arrival. It some ways, it was like \\"The 1965 Beach Boys meet the 1969 Led Zepplin\\".<br /><br />Record companies manufacture musical junk to sell to young girls, not old guys in their fifties or sixties who would rather listen to John Coltrane, Bob Dylan or Bob Mould.  Old guys don't have the money to throw around at LP's, CD's or MP3 downloads anyway. Young girls are a much better market than old guys. They spend more money.<br /><br />Since they wanted to be successful, I'm sure that both Tom Scholz and Peter Frampton were well aware of this.  And when you're writing for such a commercial target audience, artistry goes right out the window.  That's why neither \\"Boston,\\" or \\"Frampton Comes Alive,\\" made Rolling Stone's top 500 list.  Although, to be fair, if the editors of Rolling Stone were more conservative in their criteria, either album could have easily been somewhere in there.<br /><br />Popular culture ultimately ends up in the garbage, or in bins at thrift stores. If you're spending any more than a few dollars to see any sort of live entertainment, you're paying too much. Both \\"Boston\\" and \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" were the precursors of the junk culture we now have and were a real heads up for the money-hungry execs in the entertainment industry.<br /><br />Popular culture is common. Popular culture is aimed at those who are most susceptible to bend and least likely to be able to fend against it. Popular culture's only purpose is to make money for those at the top of the pyramid, to keep \\"the elite\\" in intoxicants and pay for megamansions and yachts.<br /><br />To be fair, if it wasn't \\"Boston\\" and \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\", it would have been something else. In place of \\"The Beach Boys meet Led Zepplin\\" there could have been \\"The Dave Clark Five meets Grand Funk Railroad\\", That's why I gave this CD a mediocre rating, and not just one star. It isn't bad, but it sure ain't art.<br /><br />Most people are going to hate what I've just said.  For the record, I didn't like \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and I don't like the music of Jon Bon Jovi either. I don't go to McDonald's or Burger King, and I think the cost of a ticket to an NBA game is obscene.<br /><br />In 1968, tickets to see Jimi Hendrix were less than $5.00 for good seats. In 2012, good seats for any live event are commonly $500.00 and upwards. All this just to see aging rock stars or unproven, overpaid athletes. Apparently, where the money goes to the event-goers is unimportant.<br /><br />My advice? Pay a few bucks to see your musical acts in a live local venue other than in an arena. Go to a minor league game, or a high school football game. Support your local library as much as possible.  Buy stuff from amazon.com and stream video from the internet, but support cable TV as little as possible.  Cable TV is a rip-off that's fueled by major league sports.<br /><br />And above all, be suspect of anything marketed to an unsuspecting public and always, always read the fine print.stuff from amazon.com and stream video from the internet, but support cable TV as little as possible.  Cable TV is a rip-off that's fueled by major league sports.  And above all, be suspect of anything marketed to an unsuspecting public and always, always read the fine print.

B001R4MEYI|4.0|This is a great CD, arguably Mastodon's best. But WHY does the mix have to be so damned loud? I know there's some sounds happening while listening to this disc that I am missing. This isn't as bad as Rush's Vapor Trails, but there are moments where distortion does crop up that is annoying. Maybe someday we'll see this great release get remastered and given the Audio Fidelity 24K Gold CD treatment. Before you tar and feather me, keep in mind that I REALLY like the music on this disc; I just wish I could hear this disc with more dynamics and clarity, and not this smashed together chaotic loudness.
B006UG90RM|5.0|They've done it. Way to go, guys. Love it. Love it. Love it. Eddie is playing like a demon. Totally kill. And roth is much better than samhalen. I kinda miss michael antony but thats the way the cookie crumbles. Stay Frosty!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Fun game!  Nice graphics with many puzzles to solve.  I wish it could have been longer but overall a good game.
1573228737|5.0|I first got to know Sarah Waters writing through \\"Tipping The Velvet.\\" I instantly fell in love with her style and superb command of language and character development, so I was very excited to read this novel. This is far less bawdy and erotic than the previous story, but that didn't bother me; In fact it made me appreciate her as an author even more. She has great range as a storyteller, and doesn't rely upon shocking eroticism to snare her readers. This was a very haunting, sad sort of novel about a very lonely woman who is trying to find something worth living for after the death of her father. She seeks out purpose in the miserable ranks of women in prison, and thinks she may have found it in a strange yet alluring female inmate. I won't go any further than that with the plot because it is far too intricately woven for me to summarize without giving too much away. Overall, a very captivating read that left me thinking about the story for days after. Highly recommend this as well as any other of her work. I, personally, cannot wait to read more of Ms. Waters' fantastic stories.
0545265355|5.0|This trilogy is the most moving series I have ever read.  You will definitely want all 3 books in your possession as you will fly through each of them in no time.  This purchase was superb for many reasons.  The books themselves were excellent, but they came in a nice little box-all hardcover.  They arrived in a timely manner and in new condition.  The price is beyond compare for 3 hardcover books.  You will LOVE this series and you will LOVE this particular purchase.
B004I744AS|5.0|easy to use and accurate.  best dictionary app I've used. Lot's of extras that adds to value and usefulness.  I'd download it again.
B00288KNLS|5.0|Loved this movie when I saw in theaters and wanted to order my own copy for my personal archives.  Received it in good condition and in a timely manner.  It even came with 3D glasses.  My family and I had a good time watching the film together and the quality was great.
B00762ZPOQ|5.0|This is a well-written, well-acted series which has something for everyone.  Not being a history buff, I'm not sure how much of the historical information is accurate, but I'm assuming it's close.  Can't get enough of Downton Abbey!!
B005ZUR724|5.0|fun game. simple wow type game that is mission based but plays great without a ton of complex add one for crafting. I paid. 99 cents for this on sale and well worth that price.
1469984202|5.0|I am by no means an expert on science fiction, but he is my two cents worth.  First off, the glowing reviews were what drew me to the wool storyline.  I can safely say they are right on the money.  Oh sure the character development is great, and this technical aspect is good, etc,etc, but that is not what sold me on it.  The thing that stands out the most, is the way it completely sucked me in.  The words would cease being mere text, and awaken this world in my mind.  Paragraphs, pages, and chapters, each melting into more than the sum of their parts.  I am a big fan of the Fallout series(game), and post apocalyptic fiction in general, but what sets Wool apart from the pack, is the way in which everything revealed, comes naturally.  Things you read by and accept, as part of the storyline, are revealed later as integral parts of the story.  It's almost like the further you read into it, the more you get out of the earlier parts.  The way that this is done is artful to say the least, and does not detract from the progression of the storyline, as most 'back story' does.  For instance the use of the word silo, while taken at the beginning of the story, as just perhaps the name of the facility, is revealed as a central aspect of the world of Wool.  Buy it, you won't regret it.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I was hesitant on buying this product. The price seem to good to be true. Other items with this quality go for much higher prices in stores. I was shocked. Well I read other reviews and saw how amazing of a product it was and decided to give it a chance and get it. It was at an amazing price and was shipped and arrived in very short amount of time.  Well after trying it out playing some high quality dubstep music and this was phenomenal. The headset fits perfectly, a little tight being brand new, but it will work in time. The quality is 100% beyond what was expected.  Overall, if you can find this product brand new at a good price is well recommended. I encourage you fellow gamer, purchase this product. It is amazing.  Pros: comfortable, wide open full covering ears, ease of use, great sound quality, over all amazing.  Based on another review:  Cons:  Need an amp to realize full potential  Design issues with mic  Can be quite warm after long periods  Does not block out all external noise (bad for noisy environments)
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This was just one of those recommendations that Amazon had for me. I added the book to my \\"to read\\" list and told myself I'd get back to it. Then I was browsing the kindle books my library had available and the Night Circus just happened to be one of them.  I'm sooooooo glad I checked it out. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, and did not want to put it down!
0307593525|5.0|had to have this book after seeing the move julia and julie.<br />very through, maybe i'll do i receipe per month though.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Love, love, LOVE this game!  Everything works perfect and its sooo addicting and challenging. Cant wait for more levels to be added....
0439023491|5.0|Although the pace is much slower than the first book, over all it picked up where the Hunger Game left off. Very light read, once started, it was difficult to put down until finish. If you are looking for more coliseum gladiator confrontations, I recommend [[ASIN:0979290503 Tophero: Son of Smilodon - Jungle Lord of the New Millennium]]
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I bought this for my new Kindle Fire. At first I was concerned because the elastic straps didn't look like they would fit around the device. After a brief struggle, I got them to fit. Now my Kindle is secured by it's case and it looks great. The color is a beautiful red, and the interior is a soft black suede. I have great confidence in this product!
0307720748|5.0|Great read--insightful and entertaining. No lectures here to the novice, just plain old honesty...  Kudos to the man who inspired many other humans and characters.

B0066W1AZK|5.0|this is a challenging app. the best chess app ive had and its free. you cant go wrong. if you like to play chess than give this app a shot
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Since moving into an apartment for college, leaving home the sounds of the countryside including crickets, frogs, and the woodstove, I have fell in love with this app. The campfire 1 sound is my favorite, along with rain 2, thunderstorm 2, and row boat turned to half volume. I already sleep pretty good, but falling asleep was my trouble. Now I doze of like I'm in a lecture with a monotone professor...love sleepy time!! &lt;3
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I downloaded this on a whim when I first heard about it and absolutely love it. Now that I can play on my kindle fire with the huge screen, I am even more happy! It is great because it gets you thinking and keeps you entertained. Spend the $.99 and get the ad free version, the ads pop up and down in the corner and I think it messed with you, not terribly but enough to spend a dollar and remove them. Hours of entertainment for the whole family for $.99, a must have.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Regardless of where I am and whether I have connectivity, I've got Evernote at hand. As an old-fashioned pen-and-paper guy, I should have a Moleskine and/or a Field Notes notebook with me, but shame on me, I don't. As long as I haven't forgotten my phone, though, I've got Evernote.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game starts off sweet and gets challenging! It is fun and keeps you sharp. I like that you can skip levels without having to beat them and getting frustrated. They add new \\"boxes\\" (levels) and you have to earn stars to unlock the new box. I just figured out that on the title screen, if you click on the candy, you can change what the little guy eats, which is cute (cupcake or donut are your other options). I love it on my Kindle Fire, the bigger screen makes it easier to cut the rope without getting in your own way like you do on a phone screen but I still love it on either.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is so fun when you need to waste time. can u make a 2nd game that would me the best.
B000HC2LI0|3.0|This is my favorite show, so I was very excited to order the complete series. But the description said the product was brand new in the original factory packaging. When I got the product, there was some damage to the outer case and to the individual sleeves. This would have been good to put in the review.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good lots of games that.are fun to play and have a sences of.hardness to them lord of Finn when nothing to do
1933492953|5.0|this is an amazing book that will show you how to make a \\"drawing\\" visually interesting and then how to sequence the drawings so that you get good pacing and flow. i've read hundreds of books on drawing and non of them are as good or as concise as this. this is a must buy, unless you want to stay at an amateur level of visual composition.
B005NQ5LSC|5.0|I'm a martial arts head, so anything of this sort is good fun for me. Though the acting and story can be corny at points, you must trust me when I tell you that it still doesn't fail to entertain. Good stuff here!
B004G8QTS4|5.0|It is always a joy when you find a new Author to read, Especially one as good as DW, I have read three of his books now and all of them have been exceptional! As a long retired Surfer, I can relate as I was a member of the Gentlemans Hour as well. Don Winslow keeps things moving and I love the way he adds facts and history into his novels. It makes them so much more believable and real. Good job! I look forward to reading all the rest of his books
B005M2A4D4|5.0|I love Doctor Who, and this was one of the best seasons. Kept me in suspense to see if they were going to end it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works great on EVO 4G. Even the adds stop after a few games in a row. Great graphics, fun to play, very accurate.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This game was enjoyable, but entirely too short!  I was expecting another chapter or two with more challenging game play.  The nice graphics and puzzles don't quite seem to make up for the brief duration.  I wouldn't have bought it if I had known just how short it was going to be.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|I paid 29.99 for a piece of worthless plastic. The makers must be laughing all the way to the bank. We tried everything to get the 'thing' to stand up including glue (desperate now). Finally I said its not worth the effort and threw it away. Marware is definitely on my 'do not buy anything from this company' list.
B006JD48NM|5.0|This is the best sports-related documentary I've ever seen. More than defining if he or Prost were the good or bad guy, this documetary shows how the typical human virtues and weaknesses happen at any activity (sports), at any level (high performance) where there is human interaction, regardless of race, color or nationality (a Brazilian and a French)  The last act of the documentary, while sad is remarkable and perhaps even motivational.  PS. Make sure you buy the DVD/BD for the correct region (the Region 1 DVD (for the US) will be released on March 6th, 2012)
0439023513|1.0|Don't read this book - It is a literally a waste of your time.. So depressing and at the end the writer leaves so many loose ends that you cannot even comprehend what is going on.<br /><br />Painful to read as my expectation of this book was a little more that what we got. If you really want to read it don't get to fixed into details because they wont be closed or related at the end.
0439023513|1.0|The first book was so detailed and descriptive, and I felt that that decreased for the following two books. The last book had so many gaps and too many summaries. It was too rushed and the ending completely ruined the whole purpose of the hunger games, to save Prim. I wish the series stopped at the first book, it was amazing and I read in less than 24 hours. The other two were too confusing and hard to focus.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is so fun :) my kids love it too. They can pass the levels without thinking .. great game!

B005SFR7YE|3.0|Having seen the stage production 6 times my expection was high. But, if you have seen the stage production save your money and pass this dog up. Why did they not just film the stage version in Her Majasity theater where it has been playing for 25 years. Surly they could have had a reunion of the original cast to present at the end. But no we get Albert Hall, probably the worse place in the world to have a stage play. Constantly seeing bright LCD lights that distracted from this play, watching gang planks going up and down, noise, and about every part of the mechanics in view. The Phantom was so poorly sung and played I wondered if he every heard of his role. Apparently studying Michael Crawfors role was never considered. This dog was so poorly directed, and was held in such a poor location that not even the rising and crashing of the chandelier was possible, which is one of the most amazing part of the stage production. This done solely for money and nothing else.  The movie version was terriable and this production is just barely better.  Beg, borrow or steal money, fly to NY and see it on Broadway before one day it ends, you will never regret it.  Stay away also from the 25 year special package also, not only does it not even have the show DVD, it's just a book.  Maybe someday Andrew Lloyd Weber will explain why he never filmed the original play in London when it first played and had the original cast.  Maybe he can explain why, if you are going to have a 25 year show you hire the finest singers and players in the world, then find a first class place to show it. If Louisville, KY, Atlanta, GA, DC, NY , La and others can show the play in its original form why could not this bunch.  This is a sad affair, even in the movie house.  But, for all you who can't or will never see the stage production just don't expect much and watch the many YouTube clips of Michael  Crawfor to get a sense of how this play is really like.

B0060YIBLK|5.0|This book was a terrific read, filled with clever, practical tips for establishing a rapport with everyone from co-workers and clients to perfect strangers (including at least one road-rager). As a journalist, I was using some of these techniques with my sources already, but the author offered quite a few that I'd never considered. Can't wait to try them out. Quite frankly, anyone who deals with people on a regular basis can benefit from this book and the real-life examples the author includes. It's a quick read, and the recommendations are solid.

B005HEW7JG|1.0|Amazon streaming video NEVER works for me. The free previews of course work just fine, but if I try to watch any actual content on my prime account I constantly get generic error messages saying cant connect please try again later, or cant update player. So seemingly the player has to be updated to watch free content, yet same player works fine for previewing said content? Huh?  I can stream video from anywhere else on the web, my pc is a new i7-2600k running windows 7 ultimate, and I have highspeed cable internet. I've tried disabling all firewalls and antivirus programs, but I always get the same message. Inquiries to amazon tech support results in the usual generic form letter simply stating the basic requirements of equipment. I've been usually very happy with my prime account as far as shipping, but the other touted features included in my prime account are just for marketing hype it seams.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this game and reccomend it.  It is worth downloading and playing.  It is much better than other Solitaire games available. Advertising is minimal on free version.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I am really enjoying this game! I'm a few levels in and the storyline is at least interesting.  the levels aren't very difficult in untimed mode(I haven't played timed yet) but they're fun. I really enjoy hidden object games and this group makes good ones!!
B005EVVPUE|5.0|I had this DVD when it was originally released.  For the price (which was NOT expensive) I deffinitely got what I paid for.  The additional footage from the Friday night concert made it all the better!
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Having enjoyed Grisley Manor and Lost City, I will continue to purchase from Fire Maple Games. This latest Myst style adventure game is a bit longer than Manor, and a little more complex. However, the game is easily finished in a couple of hours, leaving some questioning the value of their purchase. Considering all the creativity and work that was probably invested in their games, I think two dollars is a bargain. I look forward to future releases in this genre with hopefully more difficult and clever puzzles.

B004A8ZWWE|4.0|Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) was a not-very-successful pugilist until he was forced into retirement when human fighters are replaced by hulking robots. Apparently, men beating each other to a pulp wasn't enough carnage for fight fans, facilitating the transition into full-sized Rock'em Sock'em Robots, although I can imagine that doctors who pointed to boxing as a source of brain damage and early-onset Parkinson's Disease would likely be pleased by such a change.<br /><br />Charlie is forced to change with the sport he loves, training bots to battle in underground battles held at rodeos, factories, and condemned zoos. Charlie longs for a shot in the World Robot Boxing league, but his arrogance has left him with a string of destroyed bots and owing thousands of dollars that he can't pay back.<br /><br />Forced to attend a custody hearing for his estranged 11 year old son Max (newcomer Dakota Goyo), Charlie talks Max's wealthy uncle into paying him to take care of Max for the summer. A huge robot fight fan, Max quickly takes an interest in his father's profession, much to Charlie's chagrin. When Charlie and Max break into a junkyard in search of replacement parts for a broken bot, Max discovers Atom, a discarded sparring bot that was built to endure a lot of punishment but not dish much out. Max insists on using Atom to get into the robot boxing world, and Charlie grudgingly agrees to train Atom to fight like a human boxer. The once-contentious father and son bond as Charlie's boxing savvy and Max's unwavering faith in Atom (as well as Max's amusing dance moves) lead to Atom's rise through the underground ranks, catching the eye of the WRB. And after Atom impressively defeats a WRB contender, Max publicly issues a challenge to Zeus, the reigning undefeated champ, leading to a \\"David vs. Goliath\\" showdown for all the metal marbles (or would that be ball bearings?).<br /><br />Also populating this film are Lost's Evangeline Lilly, essentially filling out the \\"Adrian role\\" as Bailey Tallet, the daughter of Charlie's deceased trainer who has turned her father's old boxing gym into a pseudo-Frankenstein's workshop for Charlie's bots. Anthony Mackie from The Hurt Locker appears as Finn, an underground promoter and one of Charlie's few \\"friends,\\" and Kevin Durand as Ricky, one of Charlie's former in-ring adversaries who Charlie owes money to after skipping out on a bot-fighting bet.<br /><br />Real Steel prescribes to all the cliches started by the Rocky films of a down-on-his luck underdog who defies the odds and gets a shot at the big time, but the film also has a little bit in common with another Sylvester Stallone film, Over The Top. Both films involve a father and his estranged son who grate on each other at first, but end up working out their abandonment issues and bond over a similar interest even as outside forces and their own clashing personalities threaten to rip them apart. Many would also find shades of the Transformers films in the \\"battling robots\\" plot, but unlike those films whose attraction lied mainly in mechanical carnage of CGI-bot-on-CGI-bot violence, Real Steel's strength lies in its human players, namely Charlie and Max, giving the film a soul. And you can't help but cheer when Charlie starts shadow boxing at ringside during the Zeus fight.

B0011FL7FA|5.0|Despite some serious flaws, I gave this movie five stars because the best scenes (and there are many) are the most exciting musical scenes in the 80+ year history of sound movies. A few of the most memorable examples are listed below.<br /><br />The intro: Jim Sturgess singing \\"Girl\\" straight into the camera, inviting us into this strange and haunting movie, and much later singing the beautiful title song in a crowded subway car.<br /><br />Joe Anderson singing \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\" as a bedridden patient in a veterans' hospital, in the most brilliantly choreographed and produced musical scene ever filmed.<br /><br />Sturgess singing a joyous, exhilarating \\"I've Just Seen a Face\\" - in a bowling alley, of all places - in the second most brilliantly choreographed and produced musical scene ever filmed.<br /><br />Sturgess, Anderson, and a handful of playful Princeton frat brothers singing \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\" as they tumble and leap like gazelles over the furniture, through a crowded bar, across a rooftop, down a huge marble staircase and out into the quad, in the THIRD most brilliant... etc.<br /><br />Joe Cocker (thank God he's still around!) singing \\"Come Together\\" as Lennon must have dreamed it could be sung: sleazy and gutsy and oiling its way under your skin, as he growls in time to the languid windshield wipers of a bus, then appears as a panhandler in a bathrobe in the bus terminal, then as a Times Square pimp driving a mile-long white 1959 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz convertible; then the scene slides into 27 seconds of the most astonishing movie choreography ever: hundreds of dancers on a sunlit midtown sidewalk; and it finishes in the Village with Cocker again, this time as an aged hippie with long Stephen Stills blond hair. Wow.<br /><br />As I said, there are many great scenes; those are just the cream of the cream. BUT (and unfortunately this is a BIG but) the so-bad-you-want-to-strangle-somebody scenes abound too; fortunately, they are easy to skip over. ANYTIME you see either Eddie Izzard or Bono anywhere on screen (and you quickly learn which scenes they are in), skip to the next scene on the DVD. I don't know how to say how bad those two are - except that they are as bad as Cocker is good - and their scenes add nothing to the movie.<br /><br />The many great scenes make watching this movie pure delight; just keep your thumb on the remote and your eye peeled for Bono and Izzard.<br /><br />(PS: I never liked The Beatles until I saw this movie.)Bono anywhere on screen (and you quickly learn which scenes they are in), skip to the next scene on the DVD.

B000EWBKLC|5.0|I remember seeing this movie at my local movie rental store and wanting to check it out, but never got around to actually watching it for the longest time. What was I waiting for?! \\"Saw\\" is the first of this amazing franchise in horror and it's a goody. It's fresh, smart and keeps you guessing. With a unique storyline complete with twists, surprises, puzzles and intense horror, \\"Saw\\" is movie that keeps you watching. As the story unfolds, you won't believe how the people are so linked together; having more in common then you can know. And you especially won't believe the ending! It is truly epic. Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell did a great job with this film.  In a downright disgusting bathroom, Adam (Leigh Whannell), a voyeur photographer, wakes up in a bathtub with his foot chained to a pipe. Across from him, foot also chained to a pipe is Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), a doctor. In the middle of the room lies the body of a man, a gun clutched in one hand and a tape player in the other. Adam and Lawrence each find a tape in their pocket and upon playing them, are met with the creepy recorded voice giving them the staggering situation: Lawrence must kill Adam by 6:00 or his wife (Monica Potter) and daughter (Makenzie Vega) will die and Adam will either watch himself die or do something about it. The voice is that of the \\"Jigsaw Killer,\\" a psychopath who kidnaps people he feels are ungrateful and undeserving of their lives and hurls them into the thralls of bloody, mind-numbing, torturous, life-threatening games of traps, where they must find new appreciation for their lives by facing death. Adam and Lawrence are the newest pawns in Jigsaw's twisted charade, and clues to their \\"game\\" are around the bathroom.  We first learn about Jigsaw through Lawrence's recollections of three other grisly \\"games\\" that were conducted. There's Paul, the suicidal man who comes face to face with razor wire. There's Mark, a man notorious for faking illness who finds himselfcovered in a flammable substance and needing a candle to help find a safe combination. Then there's Amanda, the drug addict who wakes up with a reverse bear trap hooked up to her head and jaws. To unlock it, she needs the key from inside the stomach of her dead cellmate. There is also one other Jigsaw trap that happens later on in the movie involving a man named Jeff. Jeff is sitting in a chair, his neck braced in place. A button is stepped on, which activates two drills coming at Jeff; one on each side of his head. According to Jigsaw, he is giving Jeff's life a purpose.  But \\"Saw\\" also focuses around the detectives investigating the Jigsaw murders; detectives Steven Sing (Ken Leung) and detective David Tapp (Danny Glover). We see flashbacks of Tapp and Sing investigating Jigsaw traps, interviewing a possible suspect and talking with a Jigsaw survivor. Both are very committed to the Jigsaw case but Tapp becomes obsessed with it after an unfortunate incident. This obsession will ultimately lead him to someone else who is just as obsessed and desperate, but also dangerous.  As the movie progresses, the intensity heightens as time ticks away for Adam and Lawrence. I've seen some reviews saying that the acting is either bad, or just \\"okay.\\" I for one, actually liked the acting, especially from Cary Elwes as the drama builds. I thought he did a great job displaying the intense pain, desperation, anger and feeling of helplessness. I really got into the emotion he brings to the film. And you can feel the psychological madness within him as he prepares to make and conducts some dramatic decisions. Leigh Whannell brings a little levity to the movie as Adam. His sarcastic wit brings some choice phrases to the film amongst the horror. He has a calmness, yet you feel his helplessness as well. Monica Potter and Makenzie Vega aren't bad for acting either as they are held hostage in their home. And then there's Danny Glover, playing a pivotal role as the obsessed former detective. He does a great job with some thrilling scenes in the film.  \\"Saw\\" is a great horror movie will leave you questioning things every minute. Though not as gory as the other Saw movies, I still wouldn't recommend it for the faint of heart. The special effects are pretty good for a low-budget film. It's intense, disturbing and horrific; the way a good horror movie should be. Horror fans won't be disappointed. If you haven't seen \\"Saw\\" yet, you're missing out. Get involved in this awesomely sick and twisted horror franchise and start with the movie that began the saga.
B006UG90RM|2.0|I've been a fan of Van Halen since 1977 and have EVERY cd and vinyl they've put out, every DVD, and most of their B-sides stuff. The years with Roth were great and the music was fresh and song writing was awesome. The Van Halen Bros got rid of him and then Hagar entered. My biggest fear with Sammy was that  with Van Halen he'd be limited and the music wouldn't be as good as his solo stuff. He's been rocking hard since the 60's and ALL his material is great. Well, the music got better and Hagar can out sing, out write, and out play Roth. When the Van Halen bros decided to Get rid of Hagar, they killed the band. Wolfgang is no Michael Anthony. I love Ed's playing, but Roth sucks !!!! I went to the Roth/Hagar Tour shows and Roth doesn't even come close to Sammy. Time to retire, boys, 35 years is a good run so let's not ruin it with crap like this CD.

B006UG90RM|5.0|It took some time for me to like Tattoo when I first heard it on the radio and then downloaded it from iTunes.  I thought the Eddie's guitar sounded great on it but I felt like the chorus needed some work.  Something (perhaps Michael Anthony's backing harmonies?) was missing on the song.  But now that I have the whole disc, I have to say that I like Tattoo now even though it is the weakest song on this monster of a VH album! I have listened to the whole thing about 15 times and VH are back!!!! Eddie and Alex are both on fire and DLR sounds great to me.  I would say Dave's voice is in pretty good shape and I was surprised to hear a few of his trademark \\"dog whistle\\" screams put wisely to use.  Dave had a lot to prove on this album and he did it.  Eddie's son Wolfgang plays great too but I would be lying if I didn't say that I missed Michael Anthony's backing vocals on these songs.  If Mike were on this record, it would take my view of the album from an A- to an A+.  But I enjoy the album because it is a stellar, high caliber comeback for Van Halen that far exceeded my expectations.  Along with Alice Cooper's Welcome 2 My Nightmare, A Different Kind of Truth is another vital album by a classic artist which I hope starts a trend and challenges their peers (KISS and Aerosmith should both be paying attention to these great new releases) to make some vital new music.  I hope the album debuts at #1 on Billboard because Dave, Eddie, Alex and Wolfie totally deserve it!!!!!!  If anyone out there has their doubts, take it from me and go buy the album now!  The bonus DVD is fun too!

B00004U45G|5.0|I had seen the Black Crowes in 1990 when they opened for Robert Plant,who would have thought this would have taken place. But it makes perfect sense. This is a monumental live show, Chris Robinson handles the vocals with a so much power and flair. Years ago I had seen a live version of Zeppelin do \\"Ten Years Gone\\" in Seattle on t.v. and it sounded terrible. With Jimmy Page leading the way, to have three guitarists on stage, the song is played and sounds as I'm sure it was intended to. It was a smart move not to pick from to many Zep antham's, Mr.Page must have had a hand in that. No worries, he always was a great producer anyways. If you love Zep,the Crowes, or just plain old live rock and roll, this is one CD you want to add to your musical arsenal. CAUTION: If you play this CD while driving your car, you might get pulled over by some cop for speeding.
B0071QIN00|5.0|First off, when will people learn that &quot;Superman 75&quot; is a complete moron?  He purposely gives everything a 1-start rating (you'll also see that, for almost every app he rates, he's the first one to do so), if for no other reason than to start the free app of the day with the lowest rating possible.  Not only that, but his so-called &quot;reviews&quot; are, more often than naught, utter garbage, having little, or nothing, to do with the app in question (today's &quot;review&quot; is a perfect example of that).  Lastly, not only is he a moron, he's a liar as well.  He claims to have taken his kid to see Star Wars Ep. 1 3D, &amp; got bored, so he downloaded, &amp; started playing, the game.  What parent of a young child would take said child to a midnight showing of a movie, even on a Friday night?  THEY WOULDN'T.<br /><br />Now, as for the app, itself, it is more than a decent app, with relatively good graphics...probably deserving a 4-star rating (I purposely gave it 5* to counteract Superman75's rating).  It has better-than-average playability, &amp; the controls are well designed, at least enough to make the game simple enough to play.<br /><br />The only other thing I have to day relates to another person's review.  Unfortunately, the person in question also appears to be an idiot, as he gave the app a 1-start rating because he thought this was a &quot;trial version&quot;, purely because the first word in the name of the app happens to be &quot;Trial&quot;.  If he had bothered to check, he would have discovered/realized that this is second game in a series of games, &amp; the actual the title of BOTH games in this series is &quot;Trial Xtreme&quot; (obviously, I have both games, and will be awaiting the next one in the series).  Morons...
B0071QIN00|5.0|Awesome graphics and game play. It's a damn shame Amazon makes people use wifi to download it. Like most people I'm on an unlimited 4G plan and it's much more convenient than finding wifi.  Too bad some people won't enjoy the coolness of your game because Amazon devs seem to be stuck on an att tiered plan. I'm making an exception to my 1 star wifi required policy because this is truly a great app, you're welcome.
B0068FYZCA|5.0|American Graffiti is my all-time favorite movie, and the Blu-Ray version is pristine! The disk is also loaded with making of documentation, and screen tests of the main stars. I have seen the movie quite a few times, but the Blu-Ray version made it stand out.

B0060ZJ74O|3.0|This movie is a pleasant sports story written by the estimable Aaron Sorkin. But sports movies are always easy because we cheer for the underdog. Brad Pitt's acting was hardly the stuff of an Oscar Award. He mostly plodded through the film. Jonah Hill, on the other hand was a pleasant surprise portraying the knowledgeable but rookie statistics master mind that made the story happen. I liked that he got away from his usual image of a slacker to show some acting chops. In the end, I think I prefer an exciting horse racing epic, where the ending is seldom left in doubt.
B006PAO2FS|5.0|I've been a Beatles fan for a while now and Paul has always been my favorite. After listening to this album in its entirety I can calmly say that my opinion hasn't changed. This album is a change of pace. The album is very jazzy and relaxing; something really nice to wind down to. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this album and I believe that any music appreciator or McCartney fan would as well.  Also, for all of those writing reviews about how McCartney's voice is shot, how about you try singing when you're 69 years old? And I believe his voice hasn't wavered in the slightest.
B004RLPWXS|5.0|This is a fantastic album from a band, that - to me - really came back from the grave. Used to be an utter fan between 1984 and 1989, even liked Notorious better than their first album, yet at one point they had stopped making good tunes and that pretty much killed my interest in them for a long while.  I skipped their 1993 resurrection and even the 2004 reunion, but this time it is different and real.  I even dare to state that this is their best album ever! It may not feature as many classics as Rio for example but the overall quality of the album is very well balanced. My personal favourites are: AYNIN, Being followed, Girl Panic!, Leopard, Runway Runaway, Before the rain but basically all titles are spot on, except maybe for 'Leave a light on' with somewhat cheesy lyrics and a weak chorus (the rest of the song is mostly fine though).  All in all, praise Mark Ronson for getting them back doing what they do best and stop reinventing themselves.

0061537969|3.0|I got this book at a book exchange arranged by some friends.  I wasn't planning on taking it, but a friend insisted I'd love it, since I am a dog lover.  It was an okay read, but I didn't think that it was believable.  Oh, I could buy into Enzo the dog as the narrator,with his desire to be re-born as human.  I just couldn't see the Terrible Twins behaving the way they did, the teenage vamp, the arrest, etc.  Their was no real set up for the grandparents complete hatred and disdain of Dennis, to the point of ruining his life and his relationship with his daughter.  Dennis was a likable enough character and his relationship with his in-laws was one-dimensional and inexplicable.  I would have given up on this book, but it was in the bathroom.

1423140591|5.0|The Son of Neptune<br />By: Rick Riordan<br /><br />  This book will shock you because it's the best mythological book ever. This book is the second in the heroes of Olympus series and so far the best. As soon as I picked up the book I couldn't put it down. If you have read the other book The Lost Hero you need to read this with a capital NEED.<br />Percy Jackson a 16 year old kid is a half-blood. He is half human half god. There is one problem. He has no idea who he is. Traveling towards San Francisco he has to fight gorgons over 10 times killing them each time. Finally he makes it to a camp. Here he trains with other half-bloods. However soon he goes on a quest to free the God of Death Thanatos and save his camp.<br /><br /> This is a fictional book but has so many historical facts in it you learn too. In the Percy Jackson series you focus on Greek mythology and saving camp Half Blood. Here now you find out the missing Roman mythology too. Like how they talk and seek advice from ghosts of dead soldiers during daily camp life. Another thing is in the Greek camp campers learn to fly and ride pegasi. However in the Roman camp there is only one flying horse and they have unicorns used for healing. The Greek campers don't even have unicorns.<br /><br /> I know some people criticize the book however and I am here to make those null and void. Sometimes I find a book like this with similar ideas being repeated over and over. For example there are always books like Matrika's: The Ear The Eye and The Arm; this is a retold story plot with bad guy try to take over good guy beat him. In this book however I find new things that you never would have thought of. Also the characters all have new and distinct personalities so you don't get bored. For example a new main character, Frank, is always feeling kind of down before his quest; after and during however he gains confidence and starts to be more sure of himself. Also their personalities even if you read about them in passing are never flat or 2D. They are always realistic and full of life, like you could actually believe that these were real people. Amazingly with all his new books and other things put into this book Riordan still does not fall off the topic and story line. On my scale it gets a 9.8 out of a scale from 1 to 10. This is a must for anyone with a sense of humor and adventure, a true book of the ages.<br /><br /> Next, however good a book this is it does have an age limit. I would only suggest it if you are over 10 or 11 at least or you have read the Heroes of Olympus and Percy Jackson books. I say this because there is some cursing even if it is not all in English. And there is lots of fighting and teenager type stuff. For example, Percy gives every other teen and sometimes people during their quest his \\"wolf stare.\\" It pretty much says \\"however bad you think you are, I'm worse.\\"<br /><br /> All in all I think that this is one amazing book. Everything from modern day is in it like Percy actually sleeping on a Pillow Pet! Also they go into a store and think it is throwing ding dongs at giants! This book is all about mythology in the new technological world and us humans being dumb and stubborn enough to not believe it.

1441711643|4.0|Reading The day of the Jackal is a genuine pleasure in the tell-me-a-story, invest-me-in-rich-characters, transport-and-titillate-me a little and-spin-a-rich-yarn sense.<br /><br />This story succeeds with a nuance rarely seen in today's rapid fire style action thriller.  And does it ever succeed!  Bear in mind that to enjoy this you're expected to soak in details of life in Europe in the early 1960'---to be transported back to days when it took 30 minutes for a long distance call to connect.  The action unfolds at a normal human pace, unaided by strident and intrusive technology.  People have to pause their action, often for hours or even a day at a time, to wait for fresh information to start flowing again and set the next act in motion.<br /><br />The rotary phone pacing means you have time to ponder past events and look ahead to what's ahead in the next pages.  It also adds tremendously to the experience as you become engaged in the slow, methodical hunt for the Jackal and concurrently in the evasive tactical maneuvers of the Jackal to elude his pursuers.<br /><br />Forsyth provides his readers with brief, teasing looks over the plot horizon and then restrains you as circumstances slowly unwind to deliver surprising twists and turns from his major characters--the slick and instinctive Jackal playing mouse to plodding, rumpled, but quietly cerebral Lebel.  To enjoy this fully you have to be willing to forgo explosive immediate gratification for a slower gratification made so much sweeter by it's consistently textured delivery.<br /><br />The ending satisfies but it's the rich and nuanced journey that will stick with you when you lay the book down (or turn the audiobook off).<br /><br />So if you're willing trade down from warp drive to 1960's style mach drive you'll relish the outcome of this literary experience.

B005LAIGSM|5.0|\\"The Vow\\" 2012 is a romantic drama with some comedic moments thrown in. Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum play a young married couple whose lives take a tragic fate when they suffer a car accident.  McAdams's character, Paige, isn't horribly disfigured or anything like that, but she suffers brain trauma which has blocked all memory of Tatum's character Leo.  Leo tries to get regain her memory by trying to have her fall in love with him again.  That's the movie. These romantic dramas get manufactured every year, and I have seen hundreds of them. However, I really liked the movie.  It's true that these types of movies aren't original, but that doesn't bother me too much as long as the product is good. Like I said, I liked it primarily because Rachel and Channing were very good in the leads.  It's true that perhaps the \\"brain trauma\\" aspect of the plot could have been worked a bit more, I mean Paige remembers a lot of things that you wouldn't expect someone whose had brain trauma to remember, so this part of the movie could come out as implausible to some people.  However, most people who have enjoyed the film don't care about that. This is a love story first and foremost, so it's more about seeing the characters going through the motions and trying to get those magic feelings for each other again  The performances are excellent. Channing and Rachel have great chemistry. The acting is never forced and the characters are believable.  Once we learn about Paige's past, we kind of understand why it's hard for her to remember Leo or at least not embrace it: Part of her life has been burdened by her overbearing father (played by Sam Neil) who doesn't quite respect her decisions, an ex-boyfriend Jeremy (Scott Speedman) who can't quite let her go, and other personal issues.  Rachel McAdams plays her character well. She is pretty, nice personality, but a little unsure of herself.  Tatum is good as the guy next door whose willing to put up with a lot all in the name of love. Infact, small parts of the movie are actually narrated by Leo as he tries to tell the audience what love really is. It's a nice addition to make the movie stand out a bit more from just being another movie. I liked his discussion of \\"moments of impact\\" in the film  All in all it's just a nice romantic movie. Some might find some issues with the science part of the movie or say it's predictable, but it's a movie that you see to make you laugh and feel good at the end.
B0071QIN00|4.0|this game is a lot of fun but the audio is horrible.  All you here over and over is a dull voice saying &quot;AWESOME&quot;.
B0071QIN00|5.0|The option for touch controls rather than tilt makes this so much more enjoyable to play. It's pretty much a 3D Excitebike, and it's tons of fun to play.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app!!! I can take the bible with me anywhere now! I love the different versions and that you can download them so you can read them online or offline! Great app!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I'm thinking of buying an SB-400.  Just a headsup for those in my situation:  don't waste your time reading the numerous reviews of other flashes here.  There are plenty and I wonder why. Maybe I should review my Yong Nuo YN-467 here, I'd fit right in.
B005PK56TA|2.0|But it was TOOOOO FREAKY for me.  Maybe I'm becoming more square now that I'm in my 30s.  I really wanted to be able to like American Horror Story.... My goodness this show makes me feel like a complete prude! :)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app is pretty fun because you get a lot of apps in one app.some of the games are confusing,and others are just hard.I gave this app 3 stars because it gets boring at times,but is still fun.
1250006341|4.0|I was delighted to receive the latest and hopefully not last DVD of the series, \\"Downton Abbey.\\" I was very interested to find out how Bates, His Lordships Valet, who was in prison for Murder, had fared. Had he got off? or was he to be sentenced? I wont tell you as it will spoil it for people who have yet to order this Christmas edition. Only one disc, but it was exceptionally good. It arrived on time and was well packaged. Many thanks to the seller. Maia Russell
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is very fun. it can be challenging  I love to challenge myself and play them but it is awesome
B006UG90RM|5.0|OMFG this album is totally freaking AWESOME AND GREAT!!! I think it's their best ever. Every song is bad ass and it's makes chickenfoot sound like chicken scratch. Excellent work guys. Like Dave says \\" maybe a little slow but still ahead of you\\". I bought my copy of A Different Kind Of Truth yesterday. It's GREAT!!! Old Van Halen, new again. The Sammy Hagar days were the official \\"LOST VH YEARS\\". The real Van Halen is BACK! Dave's smooth vocals. Eddie's huge killer guitar riffs and mastermind solo's, Wolfgang's a madman on that bass. And In case you forgot ... Alex Van Halen is a monster drummer. Proof here. This album will make me smile for a long time...Groove. Feel. It's all good again.
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|Always like a good 3D action movie - who doesn't?  Saw it in the movie threatre and now like it at home.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|When friends have a falling out, it's best for all parties involved - including unwitting bystanders - that they don't have destructive superhuman abilities. Because the collateral damage off that spat is wicked crazy. CHRONICLE is one of them \\"found footage\\" films, the narrative unfolding pseudo-documentary-style mainly thru video cameras employed by the characters. Other recording devices - cell phone & traffic cameras and security feeds and tools brought to bear by breaking news media coverage - come into play later on in the tremendous third act.<br /><br />CHRONICLE centers around the strange thing what befalls three high school seniors: the popular and charismatic Steve (Michael B. Jordan); the smart and just a bit pretentious Matt (Alex Russell); and Andrew (Dane DeHaan), the weirdo loner burdened with the dying mom and abusive dad. It's Andrew who opts to escape his disturbing home life by throwing himself into his handycam hobby. As escapism he films everything in sight. He takes his video recorder everywhere. While attending a rave, Steve, Matt, and Andrew are diverted by a deep hole in the ground in the nearby woods. What they eventually stumble across somehow imbues them with super powers. Soon Steve, Matt, and Andrew are experimenting (read: goofing around) with telekinesis and learning how to fly (which is just another extension of telekinesis). Of course, there are the requisite nose bleeds.<br /><br />Andrew demonstrates a natural affinity for his newfound talents. They develop more quickly than do Matt's or Steve's. So at least he has that to feel good about. But there's a disconnect with the troubled Andrew. The family home melodrama exacerbates his sense of alienation. Still, their mutual powers draw the trio closer together. They begin to hang out a lot more.<br /><br />There's an organic flow to the story, or during the first two thirds anyway. The script allows the actors to sound off with believable dialogue. The three leads are natural in their roles; there's an authentic vibe. I like to think that the stuff they get up to initially, in exploring their powers, are stuff that normal teenagers would think up. Their antics in the supermarket are pretty hilarious, even though that was a mean thing they did, spooking the little girl. Me, I probably won't be able to help abusing my powers a little bit. Steve, Matt, and Andrew apply theirs to have fun and impress other kids (by, say, staging a magic show or showing off while playing the quarters beer game). Matt is the most level-headed of the bunch. He at least seems aware of the necessity of keeping their secret. He tries to lay down some ground rules, like not using their abilities on living things or using them when they're angry. It's worrying that the much bullied Andrew doesn't see the point of these rules.<br /><br />Most of the film's first half is so lighthearted and goofy that it's all the more impactful when things finally get serious. One of the three begins to subscribe to that old \\"survival of the fittest\\" way of thinking. He begins to regard himself as the ultimate predator and mere humans as disposable insects. The other two try to talk sense into him, but, by that stage, we're all just pretty much waiting for the inevitable downspiral into fighty fight.<br /><br />I happened to really like CLOVERFIELD, a recent \\"found footage\\" monster film (I know a lot of folks didn't). I think that CHRONICLE shares CLOVERFIELD'S sense of immediacy. Only, this time, you get a feel for what it may really be like to be caught on ground zero when ridiculously powerful metahumans furiously duke it out. One famous landmark in Seattle gets a shellacking.<br /><br />Did you think the film needed to delve more into the crystalline object in the underground cavern which (it's assumed) bestowed paranormal talents on them kids? I don't think so. I even liked that the story dropped it. The kids make an attempt to revisit the hole in the ground, but things don't pan out,and they shrug it off. And while the introduction of the girl who records with her own camera for her blog may be a convenient plot device, she does ground one of the characters. I like that there's a thru line to the story, that ***SPOILERS NOW FOR THE REST OF THE SENTENCE*** the superhumans are later exposed to the world. This raises the stakes tremendously. It encompasses the frenetic third act. There are some archetypal elements that come into play in this collision between an amoral monster and his friend still trying to talk him down. And it ultimately defines the makings of a hero. The special effects are pretty amazing considering the film's low budget. The flying sequences are breathlessly entertaining. And while I enjoyed the sense of humor and the cool superhero beats, these alone wouldn't have been enough. You required those solid chunks of storytelling and character development to prop them up.and they shrug it off.

0061714372|5.0|A must read for any metal fan. Dave is the man, period. I have a new born respect for Dave Mustain
B0064NTZJO|4.0|Not you typical, predictable, Michael Bay type action film.  Definitely more of a highly stylized art film that makes use of perfectly done visuals to tell the story rather than a lot of dialogue.  This is the kind of movie I would not have liked much when I was 16 years old, but at 27 and a lover of film now I can appreciate why this movie is really good.  I give it four stars because in the end I didn't feel as invested in the characters as I would've liked.  That being said, all around great movie-making here.  NOT RECOMMENDED for those who enjoy like Fast and The Furious, Gone in 60 Seconds, or any movie that stars Vin Diesel or The Rock.  Your attention spans will wear out within five minutes and you'll have to reboot by needlessly checking you iPhone many times throughout the movie.  My movie Grade: B+
B0021L8V0W|5.0|This was a really cool, action flick, full of interesting twists & turns.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Not about the players, but about the back stage team that forms it.  Brad Pitt did a great job of acting, and he should stick more to these kinds of films because his acting ability shines through so much more than action films. I especially liked it because I live in Baltimore and the Orioles have fallen down to nothing because of poor management and the unwillingness of the rich owner to spend any money on better players.  Beyond that, he's not even a baseball fan and doesn't care what happens to the team as long as he doesn't have to spend much money.  The team has declined more and more since he bought it, and is in last place, all good players sold.  Everyone in town would be happy to see Moneyball happen here.  We could use a different approach.  If the manager ever leaves or retires or dies, his sons will take the money with them.  It won't go for the team.  I loved this movie, because it does show that if a team has a clever manager and the right know how, even a team with little money can bring back the fans.  It should only happen to us.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|I don't find the need to own a lot of dvds anymore, so those I buy are things I really enjoy. On a whim, I borrowed this dvd from Netflix. I watched it and ordered my own copy while the credits were still rolling. Given, I am a Foo Fighters fan, so the topic and my familiarity with the songs certainly add to its appeal. But just as a documentary this was really satisfying. The interviews come across as very honest, and in the end I felt like I knew the band more intimately, and understood a bit more about what's behind their sound.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is one of the best screen protectors I have ever bought.  It was really easy to put on and there were NO bubbles.  The clear case is simple, but it fits great and is protecting the phone well.  I have bought a ton of IPhone cases and this is one of the best. Great product.
B00005N6KG|5.0|It's a real pleasure to use this headphone with my laptop. Sound is very good, so good in fact that I would rather use this to listen to music on my laptop than my Sony Professional Studio Monitor or Audio Technica Professional Studio Monitor. It's light and you hardly feel you have it on your head. Of course it doesn't sound as good/accurate as the studio monitors but it's darn good! Only wish the cord is a little longer, as I have to be right next to my laptop to stay connected.
B0071QIN00|5.0|it is the best game . if you like dirt bike games .your going to love this awesome dirt bike game.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie reminds me of the way things were while growing up. It was so true. I loved it, but the book was better.
B005KMX866|5.0|I love the music with Sun beginnings. Who cold want more than Presley, Orbison Cash, etc. I will have to admit that after listenting since the late 50's I love the sound, but always wished I could get a little different version without destroying it. Everyone wants to change the songs beyond recognition. Chis Isaak makes them new, but leaves the original feel intact. This is nothing but fantastic, all the way through. I can not imagine anyone who enjoys this type of music not enjoyig this CD. I can imagine some who say I do not like that era of music, who will find that they will be proven wrong when they listen this version.

0553381695|4.0|This book was just as good, if not better, than the first.  There are some pretty serious battles, gore, magic, sex, dragons, love, hate and a huge amount of killing but overall the combination of all was done so artfully that you never get tired of reading it even though it seems to go on forever.  I love how the authors main characters are not who you would think the main characters should be.  The story never comes from the kings themselves - it's the servants, children, and family of these larger than life folks who see the truth (or so they think).  The women are just as strong and courageous as the kings and knights even though they are treated so differently.  I will definately keep reading this series.
B000VDUWMC|3.0|The book is excellent, but I wish the Kindle version included the PICTURES, GRAPHS, PLATES, etc.  I finally borrowed a book so I could see what the author had been referring to, expecially the Plates.  Much become clear, particularly when he referred to the the pictures of the various indigenous people of Africa. This isn't the first time the Kindle version has left out such things, and it's very irritating.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I was originally going to give this book 4 stars, but then I reevaluated it based off how much I kept thinking about the storyline and characters even after I had finished the book. I CAN'T WAIT to continue the story but since this book was just released in January, I will probably have to wait a while. The book snuck up on me and I'm completely entranced by it!

1439192812|5.0|When I woke this morning, it was to a light fluttering of snow, gently settling on the branches of the trees outside my bedroom window. Now that I am up the rate of snowfall has increased and larger, fluffy-white flakes are starting to come down in greater number. The ground is starting to get a nice coating of white and a quietness has settled over the surrounding countryside. In days of yore this may have been viewed as the action of some all-seeing sky-daddy (or mom). It may even have been ascribed to the fact that we had displeased said deity in some way or another, perhaps I would have linked it as a punishment evoked on my family for my having a heated argument with my daughter yesterday evening, after all it wasn't snowing then!<br />However, as Humanity's questioning, testing and understanding of the world has increased over the centuries, we now know that this is a complex natural phenomenon involving a precipitation pattern associated with seasonal temperature changes, weather fronts and local geographies. We were even able to know in advance and tell people that this was coming.We are even able to predict, with a reasonable amount of accuracy, the duration of this activity.<br /><br />There is no godly intervention or explanation required.<br /><br />And that is the subject of Richard Dawkins' wonderful book, The Magic of Reality, which I was sent for xmas, and have just gotten around to reading.<br /><br />This book is a truly inspirational piece of writing by Richard Dawkins<br /><br />In The Magic of Reality, Dawkins covers a huge tract of human knowledge in a logical fashion from the physical, chemical and biological sciences. Generally each chapter starts out with some mythical background, based on many world religions views from modern xtianity through to ancient Greek, Indian, Chinese, South American and Australasian aboriginal myths, to illustrate the point that is being explained. Then, in a non-confrontational way Dawkins peels away the myths and exposes what we truly know based on our current understanding through scientific analysis.<br />The breadth of subjects covered is inspiring, and I would assume that is the whole point of the book, to open our minds and inspire further investigation. How different from any religious mumbo-jumbo that is force-fed to the youth in their religious proselytizing, where Our Book must not be interpreted, and any logical questions must be dismissed with dogma!<br /><br />The take home message from The Magic of Reality is that the universe is a wonderfully complex entity about which we know a lot, but clearly not everything. Scientific thinking and theories continue to evolve but the scientific rigor for unrelenting questioning, testing and further examination leading to an understanding is key to Humankind's advancement. It is time to leave the unhelpful dogma and myths behind.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1439192812 The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True]] is beautifully illustrated and I shall be passing my copy around the family to see how my children take to this logical book.<br /><br />This should be a core publication in every school library and available for all children to read.d exposes what we truly know based on our current understanding through scientific analysis.<br />The breadth of subjects covered is inspiring, and I would assume that is the whole point of the book, to open our minds and inspire further investigation.

B001E45XT4|4.0|This headset is advertised as a gaming headset, and I have taken that into account during this review. The best parts about the headset are the comfortability and the amazing ability to put the sounds where they appear to be coming from on the screen. The microphone works fine, never get a complaint about the clarity from others. They aren't noise cancelling, they don't do a great job of keeping outside noise out, but thats not a huge deal for me. They are a bit bulky, but they are still rather comfortable, and can be kept on for long periods of time without creating pressure. The sounds they produce are very clear and crisp, however there is not much bass to them. The headset comes with it's own volume adjustment attached along the cord, it works well. The cord itself to the headphones and it's connections to the components appear very sturdy, the are reinforced with extra material near it's connections, which give me peace of mind that they aren't just going to start malfunctioning because of a little wear and tear.  This is my first over ear gaming headphones, so I don't have much to compare these against, but I'm very satisfied with the purchase so far. If a malfunction arrises, I'll update.
030726999X|5.0|I have purchased the books via Kindle and my husband wanted to read the series to I bought the hardback copies for him. It is a wonderful series to read and we both love the books!
B0071QIN00|4.0|Very entertaing! Takes some getting use to but what a great app. This is a clever and deceptively. simple vane that is well worth picking up. The graphics are wonderful even though the speed of play takes getting used to. Highly recommended for the kindle FIRE! Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some of the games were hard to navigate, including the first one. You have to play the first couple of games a few times in order to accumulate enough points to unlock the other games. Overall some of the games were pretty fun. Great app if you are stuck in an airport or just want something fun to pass the time.
0374290024|4.0|The book is rich in historical content and reveals a thorough and careful research effort by the author and collaborators. The narrative seems oftentimes written in a sort of shorthand stile which makes comprehension more difficult than it should be. It is, nevertheless, in my opinion, required reading for anyone interested in  human evolution. Its rational and objective approach generates an extremely important and useful document for scholars and commoners alike.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Let me just say that when I first heard about the Van Halen reunion with David Lee Roth I was skeptical. After Dave left the band he released three excellent albums, Eat'em and Smile, Skyscraper, and A Lil' Ain't Enough. All of these albums are MUST haves and feature the killer guitar work of Steve Vai(first two), and Jason Becker respectively. There had been a long list of squabbles between Alex Van Halen and Eddie Van Halen and Dave. Regardless, I thought they had finally become mature enough to put aside their petty nonsense and give the fans what they had been waiting 25 plus years for. When I first listened to the first five tracks I was blown away. How could it be possiable that the legendary chemistry off their first six efforts could be matched over 25 years later? I waited for a disppointing song on this album, guess what? It never came. To all the haters out there let me just say that you guys are full of S***, and go screw. For anyone to say this is a \\"Bad\\" album is truly full of crap. What exactly is bad? The muscianship blows away anything from the past twenty years. David Lee Roth is as wiley and forceful as ever, his voice fermenting like a fine French wine. This IS the comeback of the decade! Without question! Do yourself a favor and run out to buy this album. Make sure you get the Deluxe edition, which features Live performances that are entertaining, funny, and whimiscal. You will instantly be transported back to Van Halen's eighties glory days. I only hope they are able to keep it together for the younger generation of fans, and the millions of Eddie Van Halen fans, that like myself, were inspired to pick up an axe and shred away! David Lee Roth, Edward Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, and Wolfgang should undoubtedly win a Grammy nomination for this album! Rock on to the Boys from California!
B004QWKIYQ|4.0|I was surprised how much I like Bruno Mars. It's cute. Not exactly my thing when it comes to music, but something more than his incredible voice brings me back to it.  After 2 days of steady streaming his videos online I decided that the kid deserved my money. I was going to get the regular album, but saw this one for only $5 more (at the time) and this version has 6 bonus tracks, which is less than a buck a song. Plus, I love his voice live, which 3 of the bonus tracks are. I'm glad I spent a little more. If you don't care about the live stuff I'd stick to the regular album, unless you're a Bruno die hard...
B005J4TLO8|5.0|This movie pretty much flew completely under the radar somehow, even though it stars Danny McBride, Aziz, and that guy from \\"The Social Network\\". I saw it at Redbox, picked it up, and was delightfully surprised. This flick is laugh-out-loud funny, with great support from Nick Swardson. It is \\"slacker\\" comedy at its finest, with Swardson, McBride, and Aziz each sharing absolutely hilarious dialogue and delivery (the line in my title belongs to Aziz). Be warned, however, this movie is extremely profane, and not suitable for children or the squeamish!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love the app and enjoy all the different reading plan.  Even if you get behind on your readings you can catch up at anytime.

B0071QIN00|4.0|Trial Extreme 2 Winter is my first exposure to the series, but if this is any indication of the qualiy in other TX titles, it won't be my last. The presentation is pleasing to the eye, with clear obstacles and well modeled objects. Included in the game is an online leaderboard, which should offer near limitless replay to high score junkies. The cliche voice reactions can get a bit obnoxious, but not enough to significantly detract from the overall experience. The physics are handeled nicely, which is a crucial element considering at its core this is a physics based game. Once, my tire became stuck in a ramp at a checkpoint, which lead me to have to restart the whole level. This 1 instance along with the repetitive voice and limited variety in environmental themes are the only things holding it back from a 5 star rating from me, but I still fully recommend it to those looking for an addictive challenging experience.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a wonderful app to keep you in the word daily.  hundreds of reading plans to choose from.  the one I chose will even read TO you if you want!  highly recommend this app!

Thank you soooooo much for this free app.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|\\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" has always been one of my absolutely favorite stories.  Its exploration of true beauty, love, sacrifice and isolation is timeless and proves why this story never grows old.  Webber's musical adaptation of Gaston Lerroux's novel is sheer beauty.  This show was my first introduction to musical theatre, so I am, of course, biased.  Nevertheless, this 25th anniversary concert of this timeless show contains some of the best renditions of the music I have ever heard.<br /><br />The Paris Opera House is besieged by mysterious and often dangerous pranks.  A shadowy figure haunts its labyrinthian halls and secret underground passageways.  When this charismatic, dangerous and ultimately tormented \\"Phantom\\" falls in love with little-known chorus girl, Christine Daae, he begins molding her into a wondrous singer.  However, because of a severe facial deformity that has alienated him even from birth, this musical genius remains hidden from his protegee.  Although he instructs Christine, he cannot allow her to see him.  Christine struggles with loneliness and grief herself.  Orphaned at an early age, her mind is filled with the childhood stories of her deceased violinist father.  Her father promises Christine that he will send the \\"Angel of Music\\" to her when he is in Heaven.  Therefore, when an unseen voice begins teaching the young woman, she immediately falls under the Phantom's spell.  What follows is a riveting story in which two different yet ultimately similar individuals embark upon heartbreaking journeys of obsession, shattered innocence, and sacrifice.<br /><br />The cast members of this concert are truly breathtaking.  Ramin Karimloo does superb work as the Phantom.  His voice is mesmerizing in its silken smoothness, yet it can also throb with terrifying anger.  Sierra Boggess was beautiful as Christine; bringing vulnerability and hidden strength to her role as her innocence is lost.  Her rendition of \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" is perhaps the most beautiful and emotionally charged version of this song I have ever heard.  You really get a sense of Christine's longing for her father and for the kind, unseen \\"Angel of music\\" who gave her the gift of song.

0143034901|5.0|Once you start is tooo hard to stop!! You'll love every single chapter!!!<br />Must read it! A friend told me about it and I do not regret my decision!!<br />You will thank me!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I admit that I should have read this book long ago.  I was hesitant because I knew it was a teen read.  My 13 year-old daughter says that this series is her favorite of all time (she is a prolific reader).  My son, 16, who is also always with a book in his hands (and reads a book in a day or two that takes me weeks) loved this series.  But after having friend after friend tell me that I should read it, and knowing that the movie is coming out soon (and since I have three children we will no doubt be watching it), I finally borrowed it (as an Amazon Prime member) for free.  I could not put it down.  What a creative mind to think of these things.  Really amazing is the only way to describe it.  I am not going to bore you with plot details - the thousands of reviews already cover that, but I will tell you that I am very sad I cannot borrow another book until March 1 - my next borrow is Catching Fire - book 2.  Read it - you won't regret it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love it it keeps me Busy. It has a lot of different games and are fun to play. easy also.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|This story is just too hard to swallow.  She's lost her memory and everyday wakes up thinking she's in her 20s then realizes (horror of horrors!) that she's 50ish instead.  My guess is the author is perhaps in his 30s and thinks crap like this is true.  Starting the book by annoying me did not bode well.  Anyway, her husband leaves her visual clues to help her remember and patiently goes over and over things with her yet she can't ever remember yesterday.  Eventually she starts to keep a journal (or this book would be pretty short) and things just don't seem to make sense to her.  What really hurts is that the author repeats herself and parts of the story ad nauseum.  He seems to have a limited set of tools in the writing toolbox so it just becomes boring.  It is a thriller, in the loosest sense of the word, so you want to find out just what happened and get some darn closure but by the time you get there it's almost anticlimactic.  If there'd been a decent editor this book could have been a lot better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This set of games won't add anything meaningful to your life and that's the best part. I simply play these when I get sick of reading.

0061119725|5.0|Bought this for a toddler class I teach - it is wonderful - bright colorful illustrations on oversized pages.  Good for teaching parts of the body and animals.  The only thing that would make this book a better purchase would be if it were a board book, since the little ones are so rough with paper.  I highly recommend this wonderful work.

3836504715|5.0|A great book, one with great history in it. I think that for a photographer interested in the history and art of photography - this is a great one to add to the collection. There may not be a lot of technique to offer here - but this is not the point. One technique Atget may have had, and has, on others is simply stopping and noticing what is around you, and capturing this on film.<br /><br />So - I think for the photo enthusiast this is a great book, but the enthusiast that is interested in the history of . .  . the art of photography. May not be the best for the straight shooter or those with new digital cams looking for a quick lesson. Fine wines for mature taste buds are within.

B0050SYS5A|4.0|This device adjusts the original Kinect's vision by basically adding a pair of glasses to your device. A lot of reviews are saying it doesn't work, I think you need to have it at the bottom of your tv, and you need to go through the calibration to get it to work.  Still, its not as good on tracking as without the device. I do believe if you have a limited space, you should give it a try, make sure you use the calibration and put the Kinect below your television, but be aware you will lose about 5% of your accuracy. Some games are better than others when using this.  The good side is that when it works, it DOES allow you to get closer. Here's the other thing, I really found it to be no big deal to pop it off on the one game that didn't seem to respond well with it on. So its worth a try if you have a limited space.
B0071QIN00|5.0|I haven't yet tried this game but have played Trial X.  That was fun and this is sure to be as well.  The main reason I wanted to write this was to let people know that the games listed as Wi-Fi Only ... aren't.  I have now successfully  downloaded 5 of them using an HTC Evo 3D using 4G.  I spoke with a customer service representative about this and he tells  me files of a certain size will get this classification.  When I mentioned that I had actually downloaded one while not having a Wi-Fi connection but instead the 4G, he seemed genuinely surprised.  You don't need the Wi-Fi to play the game, it's only there because the files are big and can you should have a fast connection.  4G works.

B006VA57CY|5.0|Season one of Downton Abbey set a very high bar. Despite others calling this a 'soap opera', I watched with an open mind and am glad I did. One of my partner's best friends lives in the UK and told us to check this out. I have to say that I was impressed almost instantly. The show is amazingly beautiful. The setting is perfect, the costumes accurate, and the acting superlative.<br /><br />This is not 'The Tudors' or some crap like that (no offense if you enjoy that program, but you probably won't like this program if you enjoy that one). This is stately, slow moving, and interesting social drama from 1910s and 1920s Britain high society. There are some 'plots' among the characters, but nothing too out of the ordinary. The crew did hire a historian to make sure that things were not getting too squirrely.<br /><br />What we see is the inner working of a large estate seen mainly from the servants' points of view. We do get to know the aristocratic family, mainly the eldest daughter and the Lord, but we also get a delightful amount of screen time from an amazing Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess.<br /><br />There are a lot of British subtleties here, and the first series deals with inheritance laws and such, so those not too familiar might be a little lost at first... but after the first episode that becomes the story in the background and the characters' relationships (friendships most often... very rarely romantic entanglements ensue - which was the norm back then) take center stage. There are a couple of servants who wish to 'move up' the ranks and they hatch some devious plots to discredit some of the more respected servants. The daughters all seem to have their own agenda and the eldest and middle daughter do connive against each other quite a lot with some pretty disastrous results.<br /><br />Season two continues the story, but we are focused less on the inheritance and more on the effects of World War One on the people living and working in Downton. The show delves deeper into individual character's backgrounds and we finally see Vera in this season, who does a good job of becoming an important antagonist.<br /><br />However, there is a little more melodrama and a bit of whining that gets old (looking at you Daisy!). The daughters are all well portrayed and they all seem to have matured in their own way. The eldest daughter was getting on my nerves a little bit in the first half of the first season, but in this season, her character is a delight to watch.<br /><br />There are more surprises in this season, more of those catchy TV series moments that big budget American studios like to throw in... but this doesn't really detract from the overall quality and wonderful acting in this season. Compared to season one it is not quite as good, but compared to dozens of other dramas on television, this is head and shoulders above the rest. And also, this is not BBC, this is Masterpiece Classics. Not BBC.<br /><br />Also of note, the clarity, even on the regular DVD version, is much better in this season. Even my DVD copy looks nearly HD. If I had known that, I would have sprung for the Blu-Ray.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I had so much fun playing this game! The selection was great and it was fun for my friends to play to!
1250006341|5.0|I purchased this for a birthday gift for my partner, she and I are both huge fans of the show.  We were slightly apprehensive about this being more of a 'production' companion; that is, showing more of the filming and set design.  Instead we were pleasantly surprised to find this a delightful companion to the world of Downton Abbey from the era.  Included are many, many gorgeous photos of the abbey and the actors in various scenes.<br /><br />The information included discusses a little about the actual production, but more as the production relates to the actual era and how the filmmakers and designers stayed true to historical aspects.  For example, included is an example of what a person of that era would use to wash their hair, or why a particular costume is the way it is.  There are fun little factoids, such as pointing out that an American heiress in England would likely travel to Paris once a year and spend up to $20,000 (and that is in 1910s currency) on clothing and jewelry to wear for the upcoming year.<br /><br />The reader also finds out that much of the set, props, and costumes are either authentic pieces from the period, or made with pieces from the period.  Many of the costumes have accessories or pieces from the 1920s.  Amazing!  But even those items that had to be made are made with painstaking detail to historical accuracy.<br /><br />And the historical accuracy of the series is what makes this companion book such a welcome addition for any fan.  This book will not tell you of the plot, or spoil any surprises from the show.  It does discuss the characters as if they were real people living in the era (i.e. Cora would have done this...).  But for those interested in the period from the late 1800s through the 1920s of England's high society, this is a wonderful book.  And it really is a welcome gift for fans.<br /><br />*** Of note: the first copy we received had some light damage to a few of the pages (creasing, some folding, and a few tears), amazon shipped a replacement immediately and we are happy now.e are happy now.

B004ZH66XO|4.0|Great App.  I enjoyed playing this a lot.  I really enjoyed leveling up my fish with more power ups.  This game needs more levels and challenges.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good assortment of fun games. The controls for the game are delayed at times and get stuck. Like the concept of having to win games and get points to open new games.
B000RJO57I|1.0|Sat down to watch my new DVD of Hot Fuzz and lo and behold, it only plays about two-thirds of the way through before seizing up.  I tried playing it in three different devices.  No dice.  Crap quality.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|this movie you wanted it to go on and on. I wish they would make another one after she marries and tells about tat part of her life.I didn't want it to end it was beautiful outstanding acting.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|This album is way better than Brian Wilson's Smile and Pet Sounds. This is a music necessity for lovers or fantastic, mind-blowing rock music, an essential album. Each song takes you away to each suites concept. Sure Brian went crazy because of this, but it is sincerely their magnum opus.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I just bought the second season of Downton Abbey after falling in love with the first and if possible, I love season 2 even more. As it moves into the World War I era it builds in intensity. Lives are lost and hearts are broken but the characters are better than ever. I almost feel as if I know these people. Mary and Matthew belong together. Poor dear Livinia's sweet last message to the young lovers was beautiful! I read someone else say it's a soap. It's simply the wonderful period piece about the lives of this family and their friends. A soap? Do we want to sit and watch them have endless dinners and balls? I love it. I watched the entire season in two days, glued to the TV. I can't wait for season 3!! It can't come too soon.
B001UHOWXI|4.0|This movie \\"Ist das Leben nicht schoen\\" (Its a wonderful life) is in the german speaking part unknow and only rare showed on TV. I think I'v seen it before only partial once in the past 20 years. I decited to watching the colorized version first. First I thought it would looks terrible like those \\"Our Gang\\" colored versions but hey.. it looks much better than I thought.<br /><br />Both versions looks on Blu-Ray beautiful restored.<br /><br />The story is heart-breaking and James Stewart is always great in his role but I think just a little bit to old (in my mind). But whatever, its a great Cast: Donna Mills, Gloria Grahaem, Beulah Bondi, Lionel Barrymore and the children (where still living): Carol Combs and Karolyn Grimes.<br /><br />TRIVIA:<br />- in a very small role as Freddie Othello (Mary's annoying high school suitor): Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer  (yes, the one Alfalfa from \\"Our Gang\\"!!!!).<br />- Directors Trademark: The bird (Jimmy the raven) appeared since 1938 in each of Frank Capra's movies.<br />- nice inside joke: when James Stewart is running trough the city and is wishing everyone a merry Christmas, we can see a shot of a theater marque advertising for The Bells of St. Mary's. Henry Travers, who plays Clarence, had co-starred in the film the previous year.<br /><br />The Music was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin but partial stock/archive material by Leigh Harline, Alfred Newman, Roy Webb was used for this movie.<br /><br />FAZIT: its a wonderful wonderful movie. Which version you do prefer will be your own decision. But when you hate the colored version then remember - it was once considered to shoot the movie in technicolor, but the laboratory wasn't able to deliver it.<br /><br />The Picture quality looks very good and also the soundtrack is very good. English subtitles are available.
1451648537|4.0|This Biography reveals what a piece of work Steve Jobs was.  And not in a good way. He was a genius in many ways, but a huge failure as a man.  Those who idolize Jobs will be ruffled by this book. I do give credit to Jobs for choosing a biographer who was not afraid to be balanced and reveal his flaws as well as his genius and successes.  And this fits with his character. He would not have tolerated a sycophantic puff piece. Even though he mellowed in later years, he was not a good man. It is telling that I have not heard or read of anyone who was close to Steve Jobs come out to condemn or dispute any of it's facts or revelations.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Add me to the list of those who had their fingers crossed that this would be an amazing album while secretly fearing it might be an abomination.  I hoped for the best, but I have to admit I thought there was a good chance I'd end up disappointed with the results.  To my total delight, this album delivers in a big way.<br /><br />Much has been made about the fact that many of the tracks are re-worked versions of songs written back when Dave was still in the band.  I'm not at all sure how that's a bad thing.  Detractors will say this is an admission that VH just can't write good tunes anymore.  The way I look at it, it's a great way to recapture the vintage VH sound for which Dave Halen fans have been waiting nearly 3 decades to hear.<br /><br />To me, A Different Kind of Truth sounds like vintage VH, probably because most of it IS vintage VH.  My personal favorites are \\"She's the Woman,\\" \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll,\\" \\"As Is,\\" and \\"Stay Frosty.\\"<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that one of the great things about the original Van Halen (when Dave was in the band) that the group lost in the Hagar years was the quirkiness.  I have to agree. If you think about it, when Dave was in the band back in the day, they really did mix some heavy hitters (you know the songs, so I won't bother naming them) with some pretty off-the-wall stuff like \\"Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now)\\" as an example.  This album continues the quirkiness (ie, \\"Stay Frosty\\"), and it's a welcome return.<br /><br />I hope the reunion lasts beyond the upcoming tour and leads to another album with DLR.  But even if it doesn't, we can all enjoy this one that really does recapture the sound so many of us grew up with.  It's like it's 1985 again...except I'm waaaaaay older than I was back then!

It really does a great job at transmitting the general principles that can help making better software, thanks to a very easy-to-read style, lots of applied examples and exercises, and awesome silly-sounding but relevant easy-to-remember comparisons.  Even 10 years after publishing, all the advices the authors offer still make lots of sense.  One of the best books I've read so far ! I enjoyed it much more than [[ASIN:0201835959 The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering, Anniversary Edition (2nd Edition)]], which I found somehow outdated and too general.

0670022950|1.0|I wanted to share a very different point of view on it in a review from the socialist newsweekly The Militant of 02/20/2012/ themilitant.com:<br /><br />Capitalist rule is source of violence, not of its decline<br />Book serves as apology for imperialism's brutal nature<br />(feature article, in review column)<br /><br />BY NAOMI CRAINE<br />The capitalist system--with its state &#34;monopoly on the use of force,&#34; &#34;gentle commerce&#34; and &#34;cosmopolitanism&#34;--has ushered in the least violent epoch in human history. So says Harvard professor Steven Pinker in The Better Angels of Our Nature. Why Violence Has Declined.<br /><br />Pinker's 800-page tome professes to trace through human history a general trend of declining violence--which for him includes everything from wars to eating meat--in order to present the current system of capitalist rule as the highest possible social system giving rise to an increasingly peaceful and progressive world. Among the fundamental problems with the author's historical analysis is that he conspicuously disregards the struggle between exploited and exploiting classes, which Karl Marx explained is the motor force of history. [See [[ASIN:1604880031 The Communist Manifesto]] and [[ASIN:0873486056 Understanding History: Marxist Essays]].<br /><br />Pinker's opening chapters describe past stages of human society that have been overcome, including cannibalism, human sacrifice, chattel slavery, medieval torture devices, and so on. He continues in this vain as he describes inroads in recent decades against racism, discrimination against women, and other forms of oppression.<br /><br />These undeniable advances are above all victories of toiling humanity: our social labor, which has made possible the increase in productivity and development of culture, as well as the struggles of the laboring classes against oppression over millennia of class society.<br /><br />Pinker manages to write a dozen pages under the heading &#34;Civil Rights and the Decline of Lynching and Racial Pogroms&#34; with only a passing mention of the massive, proletarian-led movement that defeated Jim Crow segregation, let alone the battles that preceded and followed it. It's no wonder: the struggle for Black rights was a fight against the state power of the capitalist class, their laws, cops, courts and politicians. A necessary component of it was armed self-defense against state-organized and state-sanctioned violence. And that struggle permanently strengthened the working class and its capacity to effectively fight the bosses and their government. [See [[ASIN:160488021X Malcolm X, Black Liberation, and the Road to Workers Power]].<br /><br />Pinker credits the rise of the state, particularly modern democratic capitalist states in Western Europe and North America, and the ideas of the Enlightenment--the scientific and philosophical ideas that developed as part of the rise of capitalism in the 17th and 18th centuries--for social progress. He praises the &#34;institutions of the Civilizing Process, namely a competent government and police force and a dependable infrastructure for trade and commerce.&#34;<br /><br />The general trend has been a remarkable reduction in violence, he says, spreading &#34;not only downward along the socioeconomic scale but outward across the geographic scale, from a Western European epicenter&#34;--a phrase that captures his anti-working-class and pro-imperialist outlook.<br /><br />The early development of the &#34;institutions of the civilizing process&#34; is explained well in Capital, where Marx describes how capitalism came into being &#34;dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt.&#34; Men, women and children were driven off the land. The &#34;civilizing&#34; anti-vagrancy laws helped drive the dispossessed rural toilers into factories and mines under hours and conditions of labor that exceeded the bounds of human endurance--enforced by the police, judges, jailsand workhouses of the state apparatus.<br /><br />Credit belongs to working class<br /><br />The massive expansion of the hereditary working class on a world scale over the last century, drawing in men and women on every continent, has increased the proletarian habits of mutual trust, tolerance, and class solidarity that working people learn in the course of common struggles. As a result of the accelerated development and struggles by the workers, there is less acceptance today of torture, for instance, and of racist and anti-woman violence. The credit for this however belongs to the revolutionary class in society, the proletariat, not to the capitalist rulers, the source of violence and oppression whose system creates contradictions that invariably explode into war.<br />Pinker goes through some intellectual gymnastics to explain the horrors of the two mass imperialist slaughters of the 20th Century, which would seem to contradict his thesis. He argues that 15 million deaths in World War I and an unprecedented 55 million in World War II are actually not so much--if considered as a percentage of the world's population in contrast to the Mongol Conquests over seven decades in the 13th Century and the fall of the Roman Empire in the 3rd to 5th centuries. He presents numerous charts and graphs to support this quantitative comparison to large-scale massacre and genocide, which many working people will instinctively find morally repugnant. [[“Setting the Record Straight on Fascism and World War II’ in [[ASIN:1604880058 Revolution, Internationalism, and Socialism: The Last Year of Malcolm X (New International no. 14) (New International, Number 14)]]].<br /><br />Pinker conveniently dismisses these world conflagrations as flukes of history, rejecting the likelihood of another war among imperialist powers. He views the increased membership in &#34;intergovernmental organizations&#34; such as the United Nations and European Union, and the increase in so-called peacekeeping missions around the world to be factors limiting the risk of war.<br /><br />`Peacekeepers' tool of imperialism<br /><br />These are in fact some of the main tools used by Washington and other imperialist powers today to maintain their domination of the rest of the world, its resources and labor. It certainly hasn't been a &#34;long peace&#34; for working people in Korea, Vietnam, Congo, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Haiti and innumerable other countries subjected to imperialist military intervention--often in the name of &#34;peacekeeping&#34; or under the U.N. flag. And as the current world capitalist crisis unfolds, the pressures toward greater conflict--both trade wars and shooting wars--will mount. [See [[ASIN:0873486293 U. S. Hands Off the Mideast!: Cuba Speaks Out at the United Nations]] and [[ASIN:0873487761 The Truth About Yugoslavia: Why Working People Should Oppose Intervention]].<br /><br />As Bolshevik leader V.I. Lenin explained in 1916, &#34;Peaceful alliances [between imperialist powers] prepare the ground for wars, and in their turn grow out of wars.&#34; The &#34;peaceful ... alliance of all the powers for the `pacification' of China&#34; one day shifts to &#34;the non-peaceful conflict of tomorrow, which will prepare the ground for another `peaceful' general alliance for the partition, say, of Turkey, on the day after tomorrow, etc. etc.&#34; The imperialist &#34;civilized hyenas,&#34; as Lenin once called them, haven't changed their spots over the last century.<br /><br />Pinker's bourgeois class bias and contempt for working people is equally on display when he turns his attention to the United States. Under the heading &#34;Recivilization in the 1990s,&#34; he discusses a drop in homicide statistics over the last two decades. Among the factors he credits are that &#34;the Leviathan [the state] got bigger, smarter, and more effective.&#34; Specifically, the incarceration rate multiplied fivefold and the number of cops mushroomed.<br /><br />How &#34;smart&#34; this seems depends on your class perspective. It's working-class neighborhoods, especially Black and Latino communities, that the police target for stop-and-frisk harassment, frame-ups, arbitrary arrests and draconian prison sentences.<br /><br />This is a form of violence that Pinker and his colleagues support, but are embarrassed to acknowledge and never experience for themselves. The Harvard professor is part of a middle class layer that has grown to be millions over the last 20 years--well-placed university professors and administrators, heads of charities and foundations, lawyers and lobbyists--who are largely unconnected to the production, reproduction or circulation of social wealth.<br /><br />This layer, sometimes described as a &#34;meritocracy,&#34; serves as well-paid cheerleaders for the capitalist rulers. They view themselves as smarter and more enlightened, and they fear the working people throughout the world as a &#34;dangerous class.&#34; So they accept, often with mild criticism or feinted regret, that the U.S. must have by far the highest incarceration rate in the world--more than 1 percent of the adult population--as the price of &#34;civilization.&#34;<br /><br />Pinker professes that greater capacity for abstract reasoning, as measured by IQ scores, leads to less violence. Smarter people are more liberal, he argues, more educated, more moral. This smartness has been trickling down to the rest of us unwashed masses--although not as much to the less enlightened &#34;red states&#34; of the South. It's the epitome of a self-serving justification, packaged as scholarly work. [[See [[ASIN:1604880910 The Clinton's Anti-Working-Class Record]] and [[ASIN:1604880872 Are They Rich Because They're Smart?: Class, Privilege and Learning Under Capitalism]]].<br /><br />The development of capitalism has created the productive capacity for the first time ever to meet the material needs of all humanity. The contradiction is that these means are monopolized by a small minority, whose domination is maintained through violence and whose competition and drive for profits lead to the most violent explosions. This contradiction can only be resolved by the working class wresting political power.<br /><br />To get a glimpse of the social forces that actually can put an end to the violent contradictions of capitalism, I recommend reading [[ASIN:0873488296 History of the Russian Revolution]].

It's the originality of the concept and the world is what really makes them page turners.  I'll echo most of the comments regarding the fact that this book is definitely the weakest of the the three.  I felt like the author was tired of writing her story.  The overall storyline could have been interesting and evocative, but she just summarizes key plot points and leaves out so much you stop caring. I feel like Collins was about half way through Mockingjay when someone came into her office and offered her an ice cream sunday if she would finish the rest of the book that day...and...she did it!

1596912855|5.0|Part of the reason no doubt is my testosterone poisoning, but that hasn't prevented me from accumulating an impressive list of romance novel reviews for one so afflicted.  Of course it might have been different if I had ever actually READ Jane Austen or watched any of the highly acclaimed movie adaptations, but I have not.  I even purchased (on sale with hefty coupon discount of course) the recent adaptations of Jane Austen for the Typical Male: [[ASIN:1594743347 Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: The Classic Regency Romance - Now with Ultraviolent Zombie Mayhem!]] and [[ASIN:1594744424 Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters]], which preserve respectively 85% and 60% of the original Austen Text with only the occasional additions designed to reduce the male reader's chances of lapsing into a coma, but I have not read them either.<br /><br />If I'm to be truly honest, I must admit that it probably boiled down to cold, naked, abject FEAR--fear of what I had seen Jane Austen doing to the minds of some female acquaintances.  Could even my (no doubt lower than they should be) levels of testosterone withstand the Mind Control?  I decided not to chance it.<br /><br />Then I stumbled across this book....<br /><br />In her first novel for adults Shannon Hale attempts a delicate balance, poking gentle fun at Jane Austen fandom without being insulting.  I think she succeeds brilliantly (no doubt much better than I did above) in producing something to be enjoyed by both Austen fans and their critics alike.<br /><br />A carefully restricted bequest from a barely known wealthy relative who nevertheless read her like a book is sending Austen fanatic Jane Hayes on the trip of her life to an English resort catering to Austen-crazed women with an immersive  Austen experience.  You just made this up, right, Ms. Hale?  Such a place couldn't possibly really exist, right?  Why, it would make costume-wearing convention-going Trekkers seem normal!...<br /><br />Uh, normal-er, that is.<br /><br />To her credit Ms. Hale keeps readers guessing; Jane alternates between resisting and plunging in.  She's determined to make this trip the finish of something, but what will it be the finish of?  Her obsession with Mr. Darcy?  Or something else?  Several surprise twists keep the reader reeling until the very end, and I enjoyed every word of it!  I look forward to the movie version, which I'm hoping will let me off the hook for watching any Austen movies just as reading this plus the Quirk Editions (I guess I'll have to now.) will let me off the hook for reading Jane Austen.  OK?<br /><br />Note: Somewhat to my surprise because I didn't see how she could do it, Ms. Hale managed to write a sequel [[ASIN:1608196259 Midnight in Austenland: A Novel]], which I'm also probably going to have to read now.<br /><br />Please don't tell anybody.rnates between resisting and plunging in.

Since memory on Apple products still cost many times more than any other devices, I was reluctant to send over the original 10MB picture files.  SO I reduced them to 1024 x 768 files to match the maximum ipad resolution and reduce their size to a fraction of the original and not take up as much of the precious ipad memory.  I didn't change any of the file names, using the original camera names, put them on the SD card and plugged the card into the ipad.  Nothing.  No recognition of the files or the SD card or even the adaptor.  Take the same files off the camera card directly, no problem  Great ....All I need to do is figure out how to afford Apple products with the largest memory storage and this $30 dongle wiil work just fine.

B005DESVPO|5.0|Gary Clark Jr. is an amazing up and coming musician. The Bright Lights EP is a fantastic introduction to his music.<br /><br />There are only 4 tracks on the EP, but there is over 20 minutes of music. I wish this was a full CD, I wanted more.<br /><br />I saw Gary Clark Jr. at the Eric Clapton Crossroads concert in 2010. He quietly appeared and played some great music. [[ASIN:B00428CPUY Eric Clapton: Crossroads Guitar Festival 2010 (Two-Disc Super Jewel Case)]] He performs Bright Eyes on the DVD. He backs two tracks for Cheryl Crow.<br /><br />The four songs are all written by Clark. The first two are more studio style songs. Full band blues. Don't Owe You A Thang sounds a little like a Black Keys song. I think both Clark and The Black Keys found there blues influence at the same place. The other two tracks are Clark alone on the guitar singing live. They both have a good solid clean sound to them. He didn't get that smoky blues club sound in the two acoustic tracks. Clark also has a nice touch of Ben Harper in the tone of his voice.<br /><br />I like this EP a lot. This is blues played so well. Clark is fantastic on the guitar; it is a pleasure to listen to him play. Like The Black Keys, and Ben Harper the music is, blues rock with some slide guitar.

B006OAB3ME|3.0|It's not like this is a bad recording or that McCartney isn't his usual charming and affectionate self, but after the most recent Fireman disc, this is really what he wanted to do? I'm not a Krall fan of any description. To my ears, she sucks the life out of everything she touches. McCartney is too strong a presence for that, but still.... wonder what his own crack band thinks of this? Will they have to render this stuff at the next baseball stadium they play? It's a tricky thing when established rock icons go back to cover another era's hits. Joni Mitchell pulled it off brilliantly, most others sound like Frank Sinatra, Jr. In PM's case, he does pull it off successfully. Mostly because these are among the tunes he grew up with at home and they are among the influences of his, if not Lennon's, songwriting. It wasn't for nothing that he was once compared to Cole Porter.  It's a bit of a disappointment to my ears that he'd retreat after achieving with the last Fireman disc the sort of artistic and career advance he reached, when his contemporaries have been settling into variations on a tried and true formula. Clapton has taken this retro rut direction lately as well. The disc with Marsalis was nice enough. But is that what Clapton stands for, nice enough? (Tellingly, EC is here on 2 tracks as well, along with Steve Winwood - Macca owes them big time). Maybe it's also the fact that in the case of PM, he's actually a much better writer than any of those essayed on this disc. Were we really looking for another American Songbook record, this time by a guy who could carry a tune (sorry, Rod, but you need to go away with Jeff Beck for a while)? I am grateful that it is not as groan inducing as Red Rose Speedway (the absolute nadir among post Beatles records). Frankly, Ringo does cute and amiable better, Mac.  There's been press that this was done for the new wife. Jayzuz, someone call Heather, if that's the case. Paul is getting long in the tooth. It would be nice if he reared back and let it rip one last time so that this doesn't become any more than a curio in what has been a largely brilliant career. And leave Krall to Costello. They deserve each other.

0307454894|4.0|In post-WWII Germany, 15-year-old Michael Berg gets mysteriously and violently ill in the street on his way home from school. An older woman, Hanna, helps him get cleaned up and offers to walk him home. She has to change before they go. There's this weird scene where she's unselfconsciously pulling up her stockings, which makes Michael feel all weird and he takes off running like a weirdo.  After this encounter, Hanna is all he can think about. So he goes back to her house with flowers to thank her for her kindness (i.e. see if he can get in her pants). Low and behold Hanna has no morals and bags the 15-year-old. They begin a semi-pornographic love affair (I mean, have you seen the movie??).  So, why is it called The Reader? Well, Hanna asks Michael to read to her every time they see each other. It's their *thing*  One day Hanna disappears and Michael is all emo and treats people like crap because his heart is shattered and blames her for his inability to feel anything about anything. He gets married, has a kid, gets divorced, etc. It's exhausting.  When he's in law school, he runs into her during the war criminal trials in Germany. Hanna is on trial for her part in a mass murder of Jewish women during one of the death marches. Michael feels so many mixed emotions about her trial. He's angry at her for leaving him, and he's sad for her because he doesn't think that she ever did anything maliciously-for her, it was just a job.  Then comes this philosophical monologue about how the German youth feel extremely out of place and guilty and accusatory of their parents' generation. It's a very interesting look at German sentiments post WWII. I once had an exchange student from Germany and when ever someone said something like \\"that teacher is being such a Nazi about that stupid homework assignment,\\" she would take personal offense. I never really understood why, so thanks Mr. Schlink for clearing that up.  Anyway, Hanna goes to jail for life in order to protect a secret and Michael figures out the secret during the trial, but he doesn't help her. While she's in jail he reads into a tape recorder and sends her these tapes. I don't want to ruin it, so I'll leave off here, but the ending is so tragic and leaves you feeling confused like YOU INSANE PERSON! WHY WOULD YOU GO TO JAIL FOR LIFE TO PROTECT THAT SECRET? and like I THOUGHT YOU THOUGHT YOU LOVED HER. WHY ARE YOU BEING RUDE, FOOL!  I really liked this book though. Read it in like a day.

0375704027|5.0|This was the first Murakami novel I read and I thought it was exquisite. Murakami has a very undramatic writing style which makes the stories in this novel more intense. The narrator, Watanabe, recounts his tragic love stroy with Naoko. They meet as she is the girlfriend of his new college friend. When Naoko's boyfriend commicide, Watanabe seeks out Naoko and she then agrees to them meeting them on a series of Sundays. Slowly they get to know each other better and Watanabe falls in love with her. They have sex once, but after this Naoko disappears and Watanabe has to recover from this. He does meet new girls but his heart is with Naoko. There is none new girl Midori who is different and he grows to like. Noaka then contacts him and he meets her again but she's living in a psychiatric institutaion and is deeply depressed. He goes there and has lovely visist with her (and her elderly roommate). Watanabe has a choice to make between Midori and Noaka, which is described beautifully.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|For years I wanted to transfer LPs and cassettes to cd,I started with usb turntable audacity and lame with no luck. It never worked ! \\"file not found\\" unable to create play list.  The software that comes with turntable is amazing, so easy for me to transfer any record or tape to cd. There is hardly any wow or flutter it plays records so flat. My only complaint is the tone arm is not weighted like my analog turntables, but over all I am thrilled with this purchase

It wasn't thrown together  haphazardly. It is a beautiful book that deserves a chance to be sold to all of Linda's fans.
B006PZBR8S|1.0|Sounded like a good premise and Hugh Jackman is a big name, so I thought it may be good.  I was wrong.  This is a kid's movie - like a kid's cartoon with real people.  Dull, little plot or character development and little to no sci-fi appeal.  Avoid this stinker.

0385344228|5.0|As an avid reader of Grisham & Jodie Picoult, Landay's DEFENDING JACOB captures the best of both. It has the legal intrigue of Grisham with the human interest and understanding Picoult is known for. If you like either author you should certainly consider this book. Hope to see more works by him in the future.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|has a bunch of cool mini games, some more challenging than others. all are pretty fun to play. best part is that its free to download.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|Although the writing itself is fine, I had to stop reading about half way through this book. The unrelenting litany of horrific condidtions and torture may well be true in North Korea, but it was too much for a novel. I've read other books like this (The Lizard Cage) and not felt the same, so why is The Orphan Master's Son different? I'm not sure I can answer that question. Perhaps it is the emotion that different books evoke.
B00000DCH9|5.0|The frenzied but beautiful banjo played by Eric Weissberg on the \\"Piano Man's\\" opener, \\"Travelin' Prayer,\\" sounds like the start of a new, hopeful day. The song is a prayer from Billy Joel to his girlfriend, sung in a rushed, heartfelt way. It's a country-oriented ditty that is a pleasurable mix of fun and worried foresightedness, as Joel lists off the potential hazards that could befall anyone. \\"Travelin' Prayer\\" is a spirited start to a timeless record.<br /><br />Spun incessantly on my parent's turntable, the album \\"Piano Man\\" marked my introduction to music as a youngster (it was released the same year I was born). Its storytelling songs, surprising eclecticism and elegant quality made quite an impression. Hearing the lyrics of \\"Piano Man\\" (the song) may be blas&eacute; for many people these days (due to its constant rotation on the radio and jukeboxes), but it's still a powerful, poignant tune. Like \\"Piano Man,\\" many songs on the rest of the record are narratives that stem from an astute raconteur musician who had already done some serious living by his 20s. Most often Joel's stories on the record relate phases of life, usually through the eyes of the young and invariably depressing -- thankfully periods people grow out of.<br /><br />Billy Joel would rock harder at times later on in his career, but in 1973 he seemed to be aiming for essence and style. Listening to an album like \\"Piano Man\\" takes you back to a time when songs possessed less audio aggression and overly processed elements such as compression. Producer Michael Stewart made an airtight, crisp-sounding record full of dramatic highs and lows in the choruses and an intimate feel. Joel's sensitivity and old-soul tendencies give \\"Piano Man\\" further charm. Joel, of course, is a one-of-a-kind talent who shined on every album of his career in various ways. \\"Piano Man\\" showcases him at the top of his game, particularly side one.<br /><br />Thanks for the rock and roll inauguration, Billy.

0553801473|5.0|Based on the complaints I'm seeing in these other reviews, I Think Martin has stumbled on to a rare psychological phenomenon that baffles the mind & robs people of all sense of discernment and good taste.<br /><br />Apparently, if you read an amazing book and then are forced to wait multiple years for the continuation the mind begins to break down. Especially, if said continuation doesn't match your expectations.<br /><br />Thankfully, I started reading Game of Thrones (book 1) in November 2011 and today, February 2012, I'm almost done with A Dance With Dragons. So, it seems I've been spared the ravages of this cruel mental disorder. However, I feel for those of you waited and waited.. who built up elaborate fantasies of what you think should happen regarding your favorite characters only to pick up A Feast For Crows to discover they're not there!.. The first brain cells began to sizzle. You then fantasized more while reading about these strange new characters, complicating annoyances within your previously simple fantasy.  Then waited years once again!  Finally, you got your hands on A Dance With Dragons.. only to find that your final creation didn't match the creation of the author! Ahhhh.. SIZZLE!  Well, maybe you should write your own book.<br /><br />Seriously, this book is as impossible for me to put down as all of the other books in the series. I do sometimes skim through lengthy descriptions of Dornish ham and blood sausages and Amber Gold ale, upon which they're usually breaking their fast.. simply because it makes me hungry and thirsty for unhealthy stuff. Ale for breakfast? Come on! Other than that, I love it. If you can read one book after another without waiting years in between all should be well.<br /><br />I seriously don't know what novels I can read after this. I'm ruined.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Brad Pitt was born to play this role. He dominates the screen as A's General Manager Billy Beane. The story is brilliantly brought to the screen with stellar performances, a lot of humor and touching moments with family. This is one of the few movies I have ever watched twice in the same week. Ironically titled in that the management of this team was based on a LACK of money.
0545425115|5.0|In this day and age, it's easy to imagine yourself being less than a human and being more of a number. Narrow the suffering a bit, it's easy to imagine the unpopular in school being tortured (sometimes sadistically) by the popular. Now, reverse the roles: those who are meant to help others live are the ones making others no longer human, but pawns in a dangerous game. Only, \\"game\\" is too tame a facade of a word for what it is: a government-sanctioned tournament designed to remind people that no rebellion is allowed in an anti-rebellious government, and \\"zero-tolerance\\" is not enough, nor strict enough, to comply with how things are. The only way to live... is to kill. And that's if you're chosen.<br />I've heard much about how this book is a blatant rip-off of another story, Battle Royale. I couldn't say, never read it (held it once, but that's all), but I have watched a preview of the Japanese movie. The first difference I noticed: it's a school-held competition to force students to learn how to survive in a sadistic world. Not the government, but a school holds it. Not enough for me to call it a blatant rip-off.<br />All the characters seem to have something different for a balancing act in character chemistry throughout the story, and with this many complexities in the story, I was impressed it could all be contained and remain coherent and straightforward rather than subplots running into each other awrily.<br />What struck me most in this story wasn't how devastatingly brutal the violence could be, nor the lack of language in this book (compared to a majority of other teen books), not even the hypocrisy of a system calling certain Districts \\"barbarbic\\" when they're forcing 24 people each year to kill each other off (and, in the process, act like ancient cultures that held particularly brutal acts of ritual violence and the winner would still be sacrificed), but how Suzanne humanized the victims, not just used a whole lot of meaningless violence (I'm thinking of Hostel and Saw when I say that), but use deep emotions with each characters, especially integral characters, and, whenever certain ones die, it really jerks me. I know one will eventually have to die in order for the main character to live, but it doesn't soften the blow of the death. And the things that Katniss does to reveal to the world (in her own subtle ways) that the system is a sad, sadistic, defacing system is like a call to readers that there aret imes when we should face a system that doesn't consider each of us individual, but just more factors to add to a grotesque system to systematically do us all in anyway.<br />But, when all is said and done (with rather devastating twists here and there), it all comes down to a hard ending, one of sadness and makes you wonder how well things can possibly go for a winner who still feels lost.Saw when I say that), but use deep emotions with each characters, especially integral characters, and, whenever certain ones die, it really jerks me.

B006TGWY3K|5.0|Hi Fans and Wanderers, Lacuna Coil?<br /><br />Dark Adrenaline strikes with a distinctive dark sounding that was promised by the two songs wildly available before the album release. I am one of the people that decided to get the MP3's first to try the album before getting the CD.<br /><br />1st song, 2nd, 3rd... 9th.. wow, there's not a weak song in the album so far. The flow from one song to the next makes it seem like a story of heavy amazement. Definitely something that can get you in gear. Home, work, car.. oh yeah...<br /><br />So far i was loving it. And then.. a cover song, hmm... well the choice of the song and flow of the album so far made this cover as if the original was never released before, i.e. Lacuna Coil's touch and choice of cover here matched perfectly with the intent and direction this album was heading.<br /><br />I got to 11. Fire. Guys? (Lacuna Coil) I love your work and this album from 1-10. But why did you allow yourself to \\"wing\\" the 11th :)? You're supposed to \\"take the album to 11\\" at that point, not back to 0. Anyway, that song seems like a leftover from your last album, and does not fit the complexity nor the intensity of dark adrenaline and is just too similar to existing songs from the last album. Should have been left out. Please, don't be tempted to \\"slip\\" like that in your future endeavors, for the sake of this album's awesomeness.<br /><br />The 12 and final song of the album albeit slower and more of a \\"down tempo\\" when compared to the rest of the album, is a good closure that is still heavy and deep on many levels.<br /><br />Overall, amazing album. I will get the CD as well. I only wish i could scratch the \\"Fire\\" track off it! But the rest of the CD will be played over and over to a mirror-like shine!<br /><br />Lacuna Coil, thank you!<br /><br />PS: 5 stars! It is not worth taking off the magic your art creates for a small misstep at 11. I personally view things from start to end. What you produced is worth all 5! Keep up thegreat work, and see you at your tour! Please, please, come to the North West US :)
B0011TMOIK|3.0|The movie is, of course, fabulous, but if you \\"buy\\" this movie through Amazon and you own a Mac you can't actually download it. Until Amazon figures out a way to accommodate Mac users it would be nice if they gave a warning up front that we can't download their movies. This is a very loose interpretation of \\"buy,\\" if you ask me. Seriously kind of ridiculous.

1594203334|5.0|What a great book! It's a fun, witty travelogue, a fascinating cultural comparison, and a useful parenting book, all wrapped into one.  Even though it's not supposed to be a how-to parenting book, I find it more useful for this purpose than most parenting books I've read.  Yet at the same time, I really enjoyed reading it and had a few good laughs.  I'm not American nor French so I've found surprising things about both cultures. Some of the things that the French do were not surprising at all and I found them to be just common sense, yet it was interesting to me to see how an American reacts to them.  It helps me understand Americans a little better. (I live in the United States). But regardless of where you're from, this book is a great read and a wonderful gift for any mom.

B004XDYJRU|3.0|Okay, maybe I'm a complete bozo, but I installed this app on my brand-new Kindle Fire along with some other freebies and cheapies I wanted to play with to put the Fire through its paces. Yesterday, I pulled up NPR and GPB stations near me, as well as a rock station. I didn't change any settings for the app or do anything else. I just wanted to see how it worked, and I was pleased with it. Then I turned it off and went on to test out some other apps.<br /><br />This morning, when I fired up my Fire, waiting for my coffee to kick in and myself to get a little more coherent, I was jolted (and horrified) to hear the voices of Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham. I hadn't loaded any app, and it took me a while to figure out which one was active. It was TuneIn Radio Pro, and it had apparently defaulted to pumping me full of right-wing propaganda.<br /><br />I do not appreciate this at all. In my not-yet-awakened state, the only way I could figure out how to shut Rush up was to uninstall the app. It left a really bad taste in my mouth and was not the way I wanted to start my day. Maybe this experience was my own fault somehow, although I don't know how. But I am deeply concerned about how Murdoch-pushed propaganda is being used to infect the minds of my fellow Americans, rendering them incapable of independent thought. Perhaps it's not the app developers' fault but, rather, a sign of just how ubiquitous this kind of garbage is on the radiowaves. Whatever the case, it's not going to be a go-to app for me.
0307959856|5.0|P.D. James is a national treasure of Great Britain. The author of more than 20 novels she was named Baroness James of Holland Park in 1991. James was inducted into the International Crime Writing Hall of Fame. Though she is over 90 years old Baroness James has produced an excellent novel in \\"Death Comes to Pemberley. James has long been a fan of Jane Austen (1775-1817) and uses her characters in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" to tell a tale of dark secrets, secret sex and foul murder set in the Derbyside countryside of 1803.<br />  The Plot: Fitzwilliam Darcy has wed Elizabeth Bennet the fetching hero and heroine from Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" It is 1803 and the couple have two male children in the nursery. They reside at Darcy's estate Pemberley. On the night of October 14, 1803 a carriage arrives at the door of the home on the eve of Lady Ann's annual ball. The occupant of the carriage is Lydia Wickham. Lydia is the fatuous younger sister of Elizabeth. In \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" she ran away with the dissolute army officer George Wickham. Lydia reports there has been a murder. Colonel Denny, a friend of her husband, had jumped out of the carriage, entered the forbidding woods and was found dead by George. The man had been beaten to death with a large rock. Wickham is arrested for murder. Darcy, Colonel Fitzwliiam (who is courting Darcy's sister Georgina) and Mr Alverston (who is also courting Georgina) attempt to solve the dastardly murder and free Wickham. Also of importance to the solving of the mystery are members of the Bidwell family. Bidwell lives in the woods being employed as the butler of Pemberley. He has an older daughter living in a distant town; another daughter Louisa (who has romantic and familial secrets) and a dying son named William. His good wife also lives in the cottage in the woods.<br />  Along the way we are reacquainted with Mr. Bingley and his wife Jane another sister of Elizabeth. The novel is expertly written by James. She is able to handle the many charactes and complicated plot with finesse. Her use of the English language is exemplary. One enjoys the deft way she portrays the beauty of the rural landscape of Derbyshire. The scenes set in London's Old Bailey courtroom are tense and exctiing. This humble reviewer marvels how a woman in her 90s could produce a novel whose basis in the immortal classic \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" James has accomplished this assigment with aplomb.  The novel is a story of sin and redemption. It would be an excellent selection for discussion by a book club. I suggest that the group begin with Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and then turn to \\"Death Comes to Pemberley.\\" Though you don't have to read PP first it will enrich your enjoyment of the James work.charactes and complicated plot with finesse.

1419701533|5.0|My 3rd grader LOVES this series.  He finds the characters interesting and even likes to come and tell me about parts of the the book while reading it which is a sign of a kid who is loving reading the book.  I gave it five stars because of the story and characters and how much my son loves reading them, however, there are a few \\"letters\\" from Gramma or other characters that are written in cursive so at times I need to read those to my child since he can't read cursive yet. So if your child can't read cursive, be prepared to read to them here and there.  My son reads above his grade level so perhaps come 5th grade he will know how to read cursive so this may not be an issue for most.

B0000AUHQT|4.0|Having just seen this film again after many years---I doubt I was mature enough to fully appreciate it earlier---I happily agree with Grammar Girl's excellent comments which mainly speak my own current take.  I thought Coppola's screenplay---even the version that got made-- was faithful to Fitzgerald's work: it was nuanced, dense with insights and the potential for the portrayal of complex feelings if rendered properly by the cast, which it was.  It captured the essence of the tragedy of people who have serious money and nothing else... certainly not depth, real intelligence, the curiosity that marks it... or character.  This, unfortunately, is a contingency which knows no circa; The Lost Generation lives, perhaps now, more even than once, given the increasing disparity of wealth.  The Hamptons---once cheap land comprising potato farms---house the current incarnation of the halcyon days of The North Shore of LI.....but are surely marked by no less excess and decadence.  Fact is, Coppola, who replaced Truman Capote, who originally hired to do the screenplay (Vladimir Nabokov and Philip Roth were called in to make changes toward the end), said bitterly, the script he wrote did not get made. Boy, would I like to see the untampered with original!  Mia Farrow (pregnant during the shoot), whom I generally find puerile, ersatz and cloying, manifested all of those qualities in her performance, and all were, at least this time, indigenous to the character she played, and so, for once, appropriate.  Daisy was a high maintenance-defining, incredibly fragile, and you bet, shallow, boring, patinated female who could do nothing even mundane for herself.  She was abysmally atrophied and infantile---not at all the same as elegant, to be sure.  Her husband, Tom Buchanan, was an ignorant, bigoted, ignoble boor.  They were perfectly matched.  I think Redford was well cast and formidable as Jay Gatsby, a pitiably self deluded romantic of the sort only somebody scarred by early povertyand so, obliterating yearnings and truncation.  A pitiably driven man with exceptional, unrealized potential relegated blindly to trying to aspire to the tenets of a milieu of abject poverty....albeit not a poverty of dead Presidents.  He didn't love Daisy he was incapable of knowing Daisy.  He was tragically obsessed by what she represented in the face of his early deprivation.  His inability to connect to what and who she really was, was his undoing.  Very Greek tragedy, very neo Shakespearean, what's not to love?  A magnificently cast Sam Waterston, then 34, conveyed more, as he continued to do and still does, via his face and demeanor than, I am convinced, any other actor could.  For me, all the casting choices, performances and direction were spot on.  Also, the choice of locales involving properties in many states.  While Theoni Aldredge won an Oscar for her costume design for the women, for me, her work was over the top and excessive caricature.  Flappers, even the most sybaritic among them, did not mostly wear vivid sherbet colors and cotton candy garden dresses, they wore dropped waists,  neutral colors, wineglass heels and often, tiered skirted dresses.  And so, for me, the women's' costumes were seriously distracting, not augmenting. Including even, Ms. Farrow's main wig, which should have been a style closer to the head and with the classic Marcel waves of the era.  I also thought the men's costumes via Ralph Lauren (`POLO' not exactly an arbitrarily chosen brand name) ---not unlike Jay Gatsby (read, Gatz,) himself---failed shamefully.  The suits he designed for the film were wince-making New Money Ralph Lauren of the 70s....hardly faithful to what the monied male demographic of 1922 wore:cuffed trousers,mostly vested suits with high waisted jackets and narrow lapels; ties narrower than what Mr. Lauren designed for the film.  And the men at Gatsby's parties were shown wearing already then out of fashion tail coats, not the short tuxedo jackets men of theera chose. I will say, Mr. Lauren mostly got the sweaters right. At the time, at least none of it was made in sweat shops in China as all his stuff is now.  Another nit-picking beef of mine centers on Daisy's giant engagement ring.  Huge might be appropriate, but Cartier, the source of the Bling, supplied a giant Marquise cut engagement ring, one must assume, at the request of Ms. Aldridge.  Would Daisy have chosen or accepted such in 1922? Would Rachel Zoe now?(lol) Marquise cuts are usually made to maximize final size and to circumvent serious flaws in a Less Than,inferior rough, after all.  Every small part of a work impacts.  But I too encourage everyone to see this generally splendid production of a great American novel written by a humanly imperfect genius.  And I'll be most interested in seeing the upcoming production staring Leonardo DiCaprio.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The United States legal justice system operates from the premise that a person is innocent until proven guilty.  Yet when a 14-year-old boy is accused of murdering his classmate, simply being accused of the crime is as good as being proven guilty in his community's eyes. The trial is basically meaningless, a sparring match between the prosecutor and defense attorney.  All eyes on are the parents of the accused murderer; they created a murderer, after all...  If you are a parent, you will no doubt relate to this family and story even more.  The story is told by Andy Barber, father of the accused Jacob and the first assistant district attorney.  Although Barber is put on paid administrative leave, he devotes his days and hours to defending his son who he is convinced is innocent.  The reader soon realizes that Barber's love for his son is so strong that he puts his head in the sand, refuses to see any sort of evidence that may point towards his son's guilt.  He refuses to acknowledge that his son may have inherited his family's 'murder gene.'  Barber's wife, Laurie, is unsure of their son's innocence, though.  She is tormented by the fact that Jacob could be a murderer.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel; I read it over the course of two days and could barely put it down.  Landay's writing style is easy and conversational, as well as ironic and smart.  I highly recommend this book.  I am definitely going to read Landay's other books.

B004IQ78HA|5.0|This is one of those Disney classics that I think all kids will enjoy.  Adapted from the brilliant story by Lewis Carroll, but with classic, colorful Disney animation and both fun and endearing songs, this version keeps to its literary roots and entertains.  The Disney classics are worth getting, if for nothing but the beautiful animation and fantastic singing which they no longer have in abundance in many of their newer films.<br /><br />Alice in Wonderland is one of my favorites (still! - lol) in both the original book and Disney's animated adaptation and I'm thrilled to be able to share it with my toddler who will eventually be reading the book when she's older.  Love it.  Get it.  It's worth it!

You have the vocal range of an old vacume cleaner.  Take a laxative; you're straining too much.<br />If this were just an instrumental project, I could live with it; but Dave, his crappy lyrics, and his retarded vocal range kill the whole thing.  Not even ONE good cut.<br /><br />It's a different kind of truth, alright.<br /><br />Update 4/14/2012<br /><br />I traded this CD to a girl, who LOVES heavy metal, for a fuel filter and PCV valve for my truck.  The only thing I said was that I didn't like the disc - NOTHING else (she wanted to know why I wanted to part wth it).  She was pretty excited about the deal.<br />Guess what she said when I asked her how she liked it.  EXACTLY what I said:  Dave RUINED it.  If it were an instrumental disc, she said she'd love it.<br />I now owe her for the parts.  LOL  No deal.

0307277887|3.0|This is my second foray into the Dexter novel series.  I found my first attempt quite confusing with a lot of unanswered questions about motivations, references, etc.  So, I decided I needed to read the first novel in the series.  This is it, and it did eliminate a lot of the confusion and answered my previous questions.  Not that this book wasn't confusing in itself.  There was a long stretch, almost the entire middle of the book, when nothing seemed to happen and Dexter's mental confusion led me to almost putting the book down several times.  However, I have a psychological problem in that if I start a book, no matter how bad it is, I must finish it, because I believe it must have a redeeming quality somewhere to be published.  In this case, I was right.  Although I had convinced myself that there would be no logical conclusion to Dexter's problems, it indeed was there at the end and well developed, too.  Yet, the book would have been much stronger, I believe, if the middle had some action to keep up the interest instead of lagging moments filled with duplication of thought.  Enough already.  You have convinced me that the traffic in Miami is horrible.  Do you need to bring this up anymore?  I believe this will be my last Dexter book.

0385344228|5.0|This multi-layered thriller may be a page turner (and I mean that in the most positive way) but if you're looking for a book to keep you company until you fall asleep, it's not a good choice.  The narrative kept me punching the Next Page button on the Kindle until about 4 am.  No point in reprising the plot, but the book deals with topics ranging from teen behavior and family bonds to genetics and psychiatry to police procedure and courtroom antics. The interlacing of courtroom testimony -- belonging to a case that is apparently not the focus of the book -- is a technique that is both intriguing and bewildering. Other than these interruptions, the book chugs along at a leisurely pace until the end, when the narrator rushes us through two major plot upheavals to bring the book home. The first twist turned the story 90 degrees to the right, causing me to realize that all the beliefs that had sustained me throughout the first part of the book were just wrong. There had been plenty of clues that twist #1 was coming, but I'd chosen to ignore them. The second twist, I had anticipated. I did not know how the author would carry off that plot element, and can't say I was thrilled with how he handled it, but by then the book was over. It all happened so fast that in retrospect I wondered if he had deliberately hit the fast forward button so that readers wouldn't have too much time to analyze the holes in the denouement.  Others have enumerated the flaws. Yes, some of his verbs are odd, at times startlingly so. A minor blip. The characters all seemed flat, including the narrator, but (as we come to see by the end) his lack of affect may be attributable to a particular gene. (On that topic: the book would have been stronger without so much emphasis on genetics as a driving force.) The parent-child interactions have a staged, surreal quality given that parental devotion is a key theme. As the mother of a 14-year-old, I do see parents that are as clueless as Jacob's were, but therest of it -- the relationships among the parents, the teen banter and social networking -- seemed contrived. And I don't think the author enjoyed them any more than I did. He hits his stride in the courtroom, and the jousting between the lawyers provides the most riveting scenes in the book.  If this is a genre you appreciate, you will not want to miss this book. Nitpicks aside, it's got enough entertaining material to carry you through many blissful heart-pounding hours.
B006UG909U|5.0|Sounds good to me from the first listen. I don't really get everyone hatin' on Tattoo. Maybe because there are alot heavier sounding songs on this CD. I've read some reviews criticizing the lyrics????? Who ever listened to VH for their \\"High Brow\\" lyrical content??? I've always liked the Dave version over the Sammy version of the band and if you feel the same, you should'nt be let down by this cd. It was worth the wait,,, Stay Frosty my friends ;)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a good app, what I like the most id that it has many games and mort of all its free.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|A decent little item. The pathetic corporation I work for has limited the radio volume with their Gestapo tattle tail system installed in my co. vehicle. So when using my iPod and this unit in series to my line in jack I am able to \\"overcome\\" the tyrants limitation and listen at my preferred volume level (rock on Garth!). Also using it with my home audio receiver it never hurts to feed you amp with a high power/high quality signal rather than trying to amplify a low power signal.

B006MW3VGA|3.0|I watched Season 1 back to back when I was down with a bug and fell in love.  Shortly after, Season 2 was available here.  I was not happy with season 2 from the start but hoped that it would evolve to what I loved in season 1.  It has not happened.  The characters have all taken on less likeable characteristics except for the Dowager Dutchess :)!  The story lines have become eerily soap opera-like:  returns from the dead, everything that could go wrong going wrong...  A predictable charge of murder awaits Bates.  Matthew had a \\"feeling\\"...no doubt he will walk again and also be able to \\"complete a marriage\\" although this may come and go with a lot of angst all over.  A number of horrid things will come to light about Sir Richard and Lavinia.  Seriously disappointing.  There are wonderful and interesting stories of the time that could be told without all of the love triangle and return from the dead drama.  I'll not buy another episode.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game.  It works really well .  I have had no problems with this game.  Nice,  easy way to pass the time and relax!

0451232577|5.0|Excellent book!  While absorbed in the lives of characters spanning countries from Russia to England to the USA, I found myself suddenly interested in history!  It's been a long time since I've been in school, but this is a great way to interest students in events leading up to, during, and immediately following WWI.  Better late than never, though, and adults may enjoy it even more.  Fascinating.  I can't wait until the other 2 books in the trilogy come out.

0062060562|4.0|An original,very brilliant and intelligent thriller, pushing the sense of reality to the edge. I do not give 5 stars only because the  (not totally unexpected)final is too fast, almost abrupt: after so much suffering, it would have been good to see some happiness.  I do not understand the negative reviews. It is one of the best thrillers I have read in the last 3 years. It is an intelligent and sensitive novel, and the author does not try to manipulate the reader. No useless blood, no circus-like subplots and twists, just the story of a terrible nightmare lived by a woman.  If you prefer artificial plots and double or triple endings, there are other, famous authors.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|It's a classic. Had it on tape, have it on DVD both in a 3:4 version and in a wide screen version. It's so much better that the older version of the movie.

B005C6HGSG|4.0|I really enjoyed getting to know Bobby Singer's history finally. I loved the mystery setting up why he was writing the book in the first place...at the beginning of the book. However, the end seemed kind of...rushed and...well, sort of a letdown in my opinion. I don't know what I was expecting, but obviously I wanted something a little more clever and interesting. But overall, I enjoyed this book WAY more than John Winchester's journal and about half of the Sam & Dean Supernatural books, so good job to the writer!

B005UKJX4E|2.0|A bold experiment trying to be too many things to too few people.

B001HOF8AA|4.0|I first listened to this with headphones on  My computer at work and really enjoyed it - I listened to it over and over. I couldn't wait to get home and listen to it on my home system (a zillion times better than my crummy computer), but listening to it home it seems very bright and harsh with zero dynamic range (what were the soft passages were cranked up to be as loud as the loud passages). I was disappointed in the recording quality. I agree with a previous poster that Imelda's music deserves a better recording than this. Putting that aside, the music itself is great! Some of it is kind of rockabilly, some jazz, some torch songs. I really can't categorize this music - it doesn't really for into any one, neat, tidy category (that's one reason I like it!). Imelda has a great, sultry voice and the whole CD is just a fantastic and fun mix of styles. I highly recommend it as long as you aren't too particular about the quality of the recording and can handle the excessive brightness and harshness. If nothing else, buy it and listen to it on whatever device makes it sound best - computer, phone, iPod, etc.  I give it 4 stars even though I found the recording quality somewhat dissapointing. I love this music!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Great movie and compleyed the set and was very exciting to watch easier on the eyes than the book but as with all movies the book is always better.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|This is a fun adventure come horror story with a liberal dash of Celtic mythology.  Being profoundly interested in Celtic mythology and having studied it for years, I was a little disappointed with the somewhat glib or flippant attitude towards the entire mythology. This is not a sophisticated book. The characters don't feel too well-rounded and I'm not sure there was much character development of the MC, can there be when the guy is over 2000 years old? His age and the wisdom that should come with that just didn't make an appearance in this story. I was a tad disappointed with the almost slapstick attempts at humour primarily by juxtaposing modern snippets with a mythological setting. While I did snigger a couple of times, most of the humour made me want to \\"face palm\\" - which the MC should have done at least once to maintain his 21st Century geek cred.  Interesting premise and interesting characters but they just weren't fully explored or developed. I was so into this book in the first few chapters but I gradually became less impressed as the dialogue degraded into teenage-like angsty drivel. A 90-odd year old witch even pulled a tongue at one point... I couldn't help but roll my eyes.  As long as you don't take it too seriously, 'Hounded' will provide you with some lighthearted entertainment but not much more. I like my mythpunk dark and dramatic, twisted and nuanced. This was not.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Okay, I'm really disgusted with myself. I love this film, but then I love Paris in any season, weather or temperament. The disgust arises from the fact that this is the first Woody Allen that I have watched since 1980 when I watched Annie Hall on a giant screen hung from the Arch of Trajan. As they say, it's complicated. I have truly disliked Allen's personal arrangements with his daughter and the fact that until now, he seems to have no time for black people in his film. Even in Midnight, his Josephine Baker is the only celebrity that I can remember who remained unnamed and had no voice. Still, for me it's all about Paris and this film captures my favourite city at a period and time that I too would have loved to have experienced.

It was difficult to get to know any of the characters because of the way it is told through letters; the majority of which are written by one character.

So when things go wrong, few problems in the spectrum of civil law can cause more upheaval, unpleasantness and distress.  The issues that frequently confront housing lawyers can be formidable - and if you're a practitioner in this field, having this new second edition of `Housing Law' provides the advice and guidance you need, in a clear, readable and convenient format.<br /><br />Published by the admirable, dedicated and very thorough Legal Action Group, `Housing Law' takes a practical and knowledgeable approach to just about all the common problems you are likely to deal with as an adviser, from proceedings in court...to tactics...to how to challenge decisions and obtain remedies.<br /><br />The author, a solicitor and lecturer in this area of law has brought specialist expertise and years of experience to the task of producing this book, which has already established itself as an essential resource for all those working in, or interested in, housing issues, including students and academics as well as practitioners.<br /><br />Since the first edition came out in 2008, a number of new developments have emerged, which are dealt with comprehensively within this 1,000+ page volume.  For example, the implications of the Localism Act 2011 and the Equality Act 2010 are dealt with and there is an expanded section on the Children Act 1989.<br /><br />The latest case law on the rights of EU nationals/rights of children is included and there is commentary on the various proposed changes to legal aid and funding of civil litigation, some of them of course, controversial.<br /><br />As Astin points out, `the fact that people will be unable to get help with their debt problems and their welfare benefit or employment issues is likely to lead to an increase in people facing the loss of their homes.' This may mean, she adds, that there will be a greater need for housing advice than ever.  This book is dedicated to fulfilling that need in a clear and accessible way.<br /><br />Usefully, the book contains ample resources for additional research including tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and European legislation.  The detailed contents list facilitates looking things up when you're in a hurry, as does the comprehensively detailed 70-page index at the back.<br /><br />As stated, the author has endeavoured to describe accurately the law in England and Wales as at 1 November 2011, bearing in mind that certain provisions are different in Wales.adds, that there will be a greater need for housing advice than ever.

READ THIS!<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Anyone contemplating involvement in an employment tribunal, whether practitioner or litigant, should read this book, or at least have it to hand for reference.  Indispensible for the practitioner, its clarity and readability make it immediately accessible, either for those interested in bringing their own cases before employment tribunals, (see Chapter 2 `Getting advice'), or those who would prefer to brief counsel.  Whether you're a practitioner or not, this book, published by Bloomsbury Professional, is an excellent guide to the ways in which tribunals operate and the powers they have at their disposal.<br /><br />The authors, Payne, White and Dixey, all members of the specialist employment law team at 5 Essex Court, bring, literally, a wealth of experience and indeed a refreshingly logical approach to tackling the often formidable challenges of tribunals.  As they point out, employment law is a complex area and is fast becoming more so as employment tribunals continually become more popular as a means of resolving employment disputes.<br /><br />If you have a mind to represent yourself over an employment issue, remember that legal aid is not available to you and, although you should receive every assistance whilst the tribunal is in progress, you will certainly benefit from outside help and advice, particularly points contained in this book.<br /><br />As pointed out by the authors, `a party who displays an accurate knowledge of practice and procedure and sets out its position in a clear and persuasive way, has a head start when communicating with the tribunal, whether orally or in writing.  This book is intended to assist in that process.'<br /><br />But first things first!  Before anyone embarks on the often lengthy and emotionally trying tribunal process, they should be aware of the types of claim a tribunal has the power to hear. These are contained in individual sections of individual statutes, so it is especially useful that the book contains an at-a-glance  `Claims a tribunal can hear' chart  (Appendix 1) which sets out graphically the statute and section which covers each typical complaint, together with the relevant employment periods and  time limits (some of which are of course, extendable).<br /><br />This latest third edition presents a number of updates and new sections which, for example, reflect legislative changes such as the Equality Act 2010.  For ease of use, there is a detailed table of contents, index and glossary, plus extensive tables of statutes, statutory instruments and cases and EC material. If you're looking for an erudite, lucid work of reference which offers up the best strategies for employment tribunal success, this is it!ned in individual sections of individual statutes, so it is especially useful that the book contains an at-a-glance  `Claims a tribunal can hear' chart  (Appendix 1) which sets out graphically the statute and section which covers each typical complaint, together with the relevant employment periods and  time limits (some of which are of course, extendable).

B0071QIN00|4.0|I agree with the other reviewers, this works best on the Fire with the button controls. The graphics are good and it runs smoothly. All in all this is a great app and a lot of fun. The point of view, for me takes some getting used to, but that will get better with practice I'm sure.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has the best games ever in the whole intire world and is my first choice for a game
B004XNGKBS|2.0|I bought this app in hopes to use for school notes. I'm a college student and really wanted an app I could use to take all my notes on and keep them organized. First off actually taking the notes works pretty well but that's about it.<br /><br />Once you fill up your page with notes you have to draw over what you already have written down to continue writing and it can get very confusing. You can't edit something once you draw it and you can't make drawings with multiple colors. You can't make notes with multiple pages and you cant make folders to keep all your notes organized.<br /><br />I don't see how anyone would give this app any more than 2 stars while it lacks so many features.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I just downloaded it for my Kindle Fire and if I am in the car or not at home will it still work with no Internet connection
B001JIES4Q|5.0|i am pleased with my purchase of this movie and because i bought a roku for my television, i can watch this not only on the computer but on my television as well...i am very happy with the ability to buy a movie and have it instantly online
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am curious to find out who made this a \\"Teen\\" series.  That label kept me from taking a second look at this series, but after seeing how popular, and how much longevity the series has maintained I finally gave in.  I put on my hoodie and with a look to the left, and another to the right I snuck into the Kindle store in the middle of the night to purchase the Hunger Games.  Now I can't stop telling my friends and coworkers about the book.  I read a lot, but it has been a very long time since a book excited me so much.  The writing, the plot, the pace, the story are all riveting.  Kudos (theres my age showing, I'm not sure what the kids are saying) to Suzanne.  Brillant, triumphant...Thank you for bringing enjoyment, and for making me care about characters who leep from the electronic pages of my Kindle.  If you haven't already read this, do not be put off by the misguided teen rating, this book is for anyone who loves a great yarn and who donesn't mind staying up late, beacuse you will have a hard time putting The Hunger Games down.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|Was it just me, or did no one else have a problem with the editing in this film?  Too many scenes seemed unfinished or unexplained, or simply not brought to a reasonable conclusion.  The Gringott's scene seemed to have quite a bit of action just \\"finishing\\" to soon and without the ordinary detail one has come to expect with this series.  Who was it in the Weasley family that Ron was crying so desperately over?  All Weasleys seemed to be accounted for and right there mourning the death of some unknown redheaded person.  Far too many other instances to name.  I watched this on PPV, and wonder if perhaps there was some problem with the cable company's version, or if it was the movie in general.
B0063IH60K|5.0|good game to play keeps you busy and from getting bored and its fun fun fun all day long .good
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This came is so fun for the whole family to play. we all love it. Everything is just do easy for us.
B006UG90RM|4.0|First off, I will neither wax ecstatic over how awesome this album is, nor will I bash the band for recycling older material. There seem to be plenty of other reviewers to cover those bases. I have been a VH fan through every incarnation, but I really only consistently want to listen to DLR-era VH. I was initially a little underwhelmed by \\"Tattoo\\", but it was promising enough to make me anxious to hear what was to follow, and I can honestly say I was not disappointed. This album sounds to me like the logical progression from \\"1984\\", as the overall tone feels similar. While I don't think I would consider any of the tracks on here to be throwaways, there are some songs that certainly stand out more than others. My personal favorites as of right now are \\"She's The Woman\\", \\"You and Your Blues\\", \\"China Town\\", \\"Outta Space\\", \\"Stay Frosty\\" (which reminds me of \\"Ice Cream Man\\"), and \\"Big River\\" (which, to me, recalls a bit more of a Hagar-era sound musically). My opinion of this album may change, for better or worse, after several more listens, therefore I am reluctant to automatically award it a 5-star ranking right out of the gate (St. Anger broke me from that). However, I do feel that ADKOT sits comfortably next to the rest of the classic VH discography. A welcome return!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I especially enjoyed how it jumped back and forth between characters giving multiple perspectives of the events.  The book was so good that I had difficult putting it down; very engaging with tears and laughter!  It's a MUST read.
1932100660|1.0|This book is written by an author that is considered vegan god.  But he failed to take into account areas of the Chinese diet that western culture would not accept*.  He is also still quoting the outdated 8 essential amino acids (as all vegans do) instead of the 9 essential amino acids (the 9th one not found in plants, but is only required really for children).  Further he uses studies that have been proven false and/or have nothing to do with the China project.  If you take the time to search for reveiws of this book that were not written by vegans (the most bias on his work) or by those that are Atkins friendly (they don't like each other for obvious reasons) you will find a couple of honest peer reviews that will back the above comments.  His rebuttal to the peer reviews are nothing more than personal attacks on the reviewers that do not agree with him, which in turn causes big doubts to his candor, let alone his research.<br /><br />* Plain and simple Bugs, a large source of protein that are sold in Asian countries in numberous ways to include canned, deep fried, live, on a stick, soups, and many other ways.  Those that have actually been to asian countries and have interacted with the culture would or should I say DO know this.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I usually don't rate games, but I love, love, love this one, and want the makers to be encouraged to make more like this one! Fun and challenging without being too difficult. Grisly Manor was great too! When they come out with a new one I will definitely buy it!
B0071QIN00|5.0|part 1 was already super cool very unique and super awesome. I thought part 2 is gonna be just like part 1 and I was really excited. nope, part 2 is way better blows it away. better character animation, better physics, better rendering, better sound, better music. of course the best part now that for at least today it's free. thanks for making this happen guys it's the best.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|I had heard Joe Bonamassa sampled on a local radio show, but that was the extent of what I knew about him other than that he's from upstate New York. Then a few weeks ago, I saw Black Country Reunion on Palladia, with Joe Bonamassa and Glenn Hughes, and I got really interested to find out more.  After listening to samples on Amazon and reading scores of reviews from Bonamassa fans, I decided to buy Blues Deluxe.  If you love the blues, if you like nothing better than to sit and listen to some AWESOME guitar work, then this CD is an excellent choice.  Bonamassa will blow your socks off. He IS the real deal -- he can play and sing the blues with the best. This is my new favorite CD!  Go ahead, buy it and crank it up, you're in for a treat!
B006UG90RM|2.0|On first listening I am not impressed with this album. I think it just doesnt compare with any of the van halen or van hagar albums. Daves voice still seems ok to me and the harmony is ok. Even though there is no Mike Anthony there are still some high notes but there are also alot of low notes. I dont know who is doing all these bass notes but I dont think I like it one bit.<br />  Ok. Ive had this in the player for a week. I was completely off on my first opinion, NOT! I agree with other people who say that this cd seems to be unfinished in the production area. It does sound muddy with no crispness to the trebble and the instruments run together. If you are one of those people who will like anything just because of who did it you might like this alot. If you are expecting a little more from some guys who have been at this a long time and have something to prove you might be dissapointed like myself.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Loved this movie! Robert Downey Jr. & Jude Law are great. Bought it after seeing it in the theatre. Plan to buy #2 when it's released. Movies definitely worth watching again and again.
B006PKQQJS|1.0|I got it, played it. but really all you can do is tap the screen. waste of money. I'm not impressed. not what I expected.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it is the best note taking apps i have ever used. you can sync the note on your Pc, kindle, iphone at the same time, super convenient.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good and engaging book. Every chapter seems to end o s cliffhanger which makes you read for hours. Very strange premise and didn't seem like something id be interested in but I loved it!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is so hard to put down after you start to get into it.  The game has great graphics and image. it works great for the kindle fire and I have no complaints.
145162445X|5.0|This book provides amazing answers to long held questions about how and where it all started..It's easy good reading and gives one a boat load of info for discussion with individuals not so versed in the Universe.
B005T87QCI|4.0|its super fun, but it gets old after a while, and there needs to be an update with more robots lime Zeus and atom
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that without this game on my fire I would be bored. this game is so awesome because it doesn't run the battery down and its fun. good job.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Awesome on my Kindle Fire! my 4 yr old convinced me to get this, so for $0.99, I did. she can do a few levels, but I'm addicted to it. a lot of variety. some levels can be challenging to visualize the win. but that makes it a lot of fun Bc you have to think several moves ahead. great graphics. I have beaten all the levels bur now enjoy going back and trying to beat my best score. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Great movie, thanks for putting this on.  I would love to see more of these movies, also if you need material that is true and inspirational please contact \\"new life community Church in chicago\\" we have many stories.  p.s. I enjoyed the interracial relationships portrayed in this movie.  p.s. II  please make a little more effort in actors that speak Spanish, it was a little corny. sorry for being critical hope it helps to make the future movies more realistic.
1439153663|5.0|Kathleen Grissom's first novel is a gripping account of colonial plantation life told from the alternating perspectives of Lavinia, an indentured servant from Ireland, and Belle, a slave.  As the story opens, Lavinia is a mere child who is placed in the care of the black house servants and lives with them in their quarters.  Belle, one of the house servants, is the illegitimate daughter of the plantation master.  The story that unfolds is seen through both blue and brown eyes as Uncle Jacob would say.  It is a heart-wrenching tale.  I'm sorry to have finished the book---it's that good!!
B0071QIN00|3.0|this game should be free because it has a few minor problems but you haters who put it a 1 star are just stupid.Its meant to be a fun game
0783230079|5.0|We just revisited this movie and it was so heartwarming! The beginning, set in 1959, is quite gripping and then the situations that evolve just tug at your heart. I am so glad this is a PG movie! Why? because then folks who shy away from PG-13 movies, which can sometimes surprise and disappoint sensitive viewers with just one shocking scene, will give this one a look. This movie uplifts and touches the heart with tender and powerful portrayals of true love. There are laughs to be had, too, and the movie also contains the hallmark of all great movies in my estimation: a dance scene! Cameo by B B King was great! See it! You'll be a better person for it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good cool and fun I like it because. you can be on one game all day its a lot of fun for everyone. and all of the family
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Definitely a movie that every American should watch and be better educated about the process of food in the America economy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I let it read verses to me while I sleep. This app so far. would give it 10 stars if i could.
B0071QIN00|4.0|@J. Bond shup up and appreciate the free stuff in life man, we don't live forever. chill out with the negativity. If you don't like just move on, just don't freaking tell somebody to stop doing what they like because you don't like it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is so convenient . Especially. If I want to watch stuff from my bed on the kindle and don't have to wait for the lag since its using the specs on my computer.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This watch is awesome! I`ve been using it in my rowing trainings and it is working fine for this exercise too.  The wireless USB transfer is great, when I come home the watch starts to update the exercises of the day automatically.  I have even added my workout training using the Training Center, excellent.  It is possible to add and share, exercises online using the Garmin website, and you can also export the map datas to Google earth or Google Maps.  Have no cons to talk about, only pros!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I was a Twilight \\"late bloomer\\" (having somehow missed all the excitement when it all started), but I've been catching up in the past few months. Have mostly read all the books (am in the middle of \\"Breaking Dawn\\" right now), and seen all the movies (several times over!).\\"Eclipse\\" is just as awesome as the first two movies, and I'm eagerly awaiting my pre-ordered copy of \\"Breaking Dawn\\" from Amazon this weekend. As much as I've enjoyed the books, I have to say that screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg's scripts have given us the best, truest version of Bella and Edward's story, along with that of the amazing Cullens and the werewolves. It's good to read the books for back-story and all the little details, but the movies, including \\"Eclipse\\" ROCK.
B0073Q0DZG|3.0|My husband and I thought this was going to be very funny based on the reviews, but it fell flat. We both agreed that it was enjoyable, but there wasn't anything overly funny or special about it.
0307279189|5.0|I first \\"read\\" this book on my iPod as an audiobook, and enjoyed it so thoroughly that I had to buy the actual book! Christopher McDougall's journey from broken-down, injured runner to the wilds of Mexico to find the mythical \\"lost tribe\\" of Tarahumara Indians -- the greatest runners ever -- is a fun and fascinating story full of mystery, intrigue, drama, unforgettable characters and science! Great book and a \\"must read\\" for all runners, and wannabe runners.
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|I loved this CD. This score is very different from the other three movies. I have it in car CD player so I listen to it all the time. Carter Burwell is very talented. He wrote the score for the first Twilight movie and also wrote thusic for \\" Bella Theme\\" which was a beautiful ending to Breaking Dawn Part One. Can't wait for the score to Part Two.
0385344228|5.0|If you were to check on my Amazon reviews you would not find fiction books among them.  I have tried numerous times to read a book of fiction and quit in frustration after a few chapters.  Despite failing at my attempts at fiction I decided to try reading \\"Defending Jacob.\\"  I surprisingly found the book to be a riveting read, and very difficult to put down.  Perhaps it was the dialogue the author provided that kept me interested, or the real life frustrations and agony that were so eloquently expressed throughout the book.  I thought author William Landay expressed himself vividly in describing the feelings of the Barber family in their relationships with one another and the other characters in the story.<br /><br />As I said I have found it very difficult to read fiction, but each time I had to reluctantly put the book down I looked forward eagerly to getting back into the story once again.  As a reader of non-fiction I found this book of fiction an easy five star book.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, either a reader of fiction or non-fiction.
B006UG90RM|5.0|TWO YEARS FROM NOW THIS WILL SOUND BETTER THAN IT DOES NOW . THAT IS WHAT A CLASSIC IS MADE OF .WHAT A BAND 4.5 STARS THE MUSIC IS DOING THE TALKING ( NOT LIKE THE PREVIOUS SINGER CRYING TO THE PRESS EVERYDAY )
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a very versatile bag. It can be used to carry a 35 mm SLR camera body with a number of lenses, external flash, chargers etc. You can also fit a 35 mm SLR camera with lens and a video camera. The price is very reasonable.[[ASIN:B002VPE1WK AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR Cameras and Accessories (Black)]]
B0071QIN00|5.0|this is one of the best FAOTD I'fe had luck ti download, the graphics are awesome, the controls are good the concept is great, the bike sounds are realistic, and the music and other sound effects are pretty good.<br />definitely you will find this app very entertaining l, I can azure that.<br />here the objective is to ride your bike though a long and bumpy road without killing yourself.<br />NICELY DONE!!! .
B0071QIN00|4.0|I was a fan of the first version. I was glad to find this one. After playing a few levels, I like the original better. I'll still try to finish this one but I won't put the effort in to getting three stars on each level. First version was 5 star worthy, this one only 4 stars.
B006UG90RM|2.0|I've been looking forward to this for a long time, but something is missing.  The songs on this new release aren't catchy at all.  The songs sound as though you took a bunch of different Van Halen songs and put them in a blender. Not one track to me really stands out.  It's a very fast paced CD.  It's sounds like too much is going on at the same time.  Like things have been thrown together.  Maybe the next CD will sound more put togther, if the band doesn't break up.
0062119044|5.0|I could not put this novel down, it hooked me from the first page, lassoed my emotions. The dramatic twists were suspenseful and expertly written.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is amazing. When I have Internet I use this to download funny or entertaining videos so that when I'm bored and no Internet I have something to do. Works great on kindle fire.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I don't know why everyone is complaining about only starting with a few games it says that in the discription ThATS THE point!!!!!!!!!!
B0057URWSQ|5.0|We started watching suits a few episodes in and couldn't find the pilot on On Demand.<br /><br />Suits is one of the best summer shows and the best show on USA Network, imho.<br /><br />Characters are engaging and real.  Harvey is a snarky bastard and we love him.  This is not a serious law show, so if you're going to nitpick the realism, don't bother.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Joe Bonmassa is a true artist.  He's genius.  If you are wondering whether or not to buy this dvd, or cd, DO.  You will be SOOOOOO happy that you did.  It will BLOW YOU AWAY. He is beyond words.  My husband and I could just sit and watch this dvd for hours on end.  His band is also out of this world!  You will not regret buying this dvd.  We first saw this concert on PBS, and fell in love with it.  So, then we decided to buy the dvd of the same concert. The dvd has 10 more songs (that really ROCK) that were not on the PBS showing, and some extras. If you are a blues OR a rock fan, you are in for a real treat!!!  Even if you're not a blues fan, you will be thrilled!  BRAVO!  ORDER THIS DVD NOW!!!!!!!!!!!  This perfomance is STELLAR!
B006O5XYWG|4.0|This is a good movie for several reasons. The one I like the most was watching Cesaer build into the leader. Proving that leadership is about what you do, not what you say. Thus, why I think my boss should watch it...and learn.  That being said, I'm not really a fan of Planet of the Apes, but this movie is still worth watching.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I have tried every todo list for Android and this is the best I have found that includes repeat tasks and google task synch.  Got it as free app of the day,  but worth buying.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|love it that there is a little story with it. The story and artificates make it even more fun. the tile sets are beautiful.
B00004XPPE|5.0|This is a great movie with outstanding acting. Fonda, as always, portrayed a believable president who had to make a tough decision with no regard to personal circumstances.  DVD arrived within a few days and was high quality.
1451627289|5.0|What a page turner! I love the historical/science fiction hybrid. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.
0316056871|3.0|I bought this book after hearing a portion of it read on Public Radio.  As it turned out,that was the best part of the book! I was touched by the author's handling of some topics, such as her portrayal of Sarah Palin on SNL.But much of the \\"humor\\" in the book was just not funny to me. Bossypants is a book I would not go out of my way to recommend to friends, but I might find parts of the book for them to read.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|nice little series of games to keep you occupied.  haven't had an update yet so no problems there. can't ask for much from a free game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very fun game. I definitely recommend it. I love to play this game as it is addicting.
B002Y5FKUE|5.0|The staging for the Met's 2009 production of Bellini's wonderful La Sonnambula is not traditional ... but I found it a very satisfying and worthwhile experience nevertheless.<br /><br />This video has several qualities that recommend it ... the first and foremost being the beautiful melodies which Bellini is famous for.  As long as the musicians and the singers do their part, Bellini's music is in a league by itself.  And in this instance, yes, the Met's very capable orchestra does not disappoint.<br /><br />The brilliant tenor Juan Diego Florez and the always charming and talented Natalie Dessay share a fine chemistry and deliver terrific performances.  Their duet \\"Prendi: l'anel ti dono\\", an Act I highlight, is heavenly.<br /><br />Yes, the \\"rehearsal\\" concept (described elsewhere among these reviews) is admittedly different ... but the relatively simple story line combined with the fine acting abilities of Ms. Dessay and JDF, allow this concept, in this instance anyway, to not interfere with the main objective - to be entertaining  and uplifting.<br /><br />I found the final portion of Act II especially rewarding, beginning with \\"Ah! non credea mirarti\\", as a section of the Met's stage cleverly carries Ms. Dessay a good 10 ft. or so over the orchestra pit and providing her with a well deserved spotlight apart from everyone else.  This is then followed up by the rousing finale complete with period costumes (finally:-), and a heart-warming happy ending.<br /><br />The video and audio qualities for this DVD are up to the standards one would hope for in this format.
B006UG90RM|2.0|OK..so I have been a VH Fan forever. Even through the Sammy years. The only album I disliked and did not purchase was VHIII (and I may like this one even less)! I had high hopes for this one, and even enjoyed \\"tattoo\\" somewhat. But I hoped the full album would be killer. MAN was I wrong. If you listen to the classic VH albums and then this one right after you will say \\"WTF did I just listen to\\"??<br /><br />The 5 star reviews are from the die hards who will give 5 stars to anything VH puts out. I see the same thing with KISS, who has been my fave band since 1978. Their last album was lousy (Sonic Boom) but when it came out I raved about it, only because i was so excited they had something new. BUt over time I realized what a stinker that album was and is. But back to this VH album. One song is catchy...somewhat, and that is \\"She's A Woman\\". The rest are disjointed, sloppy, have an overemphasis on Eddy and the lyrics are pretty rotten. As in bad. Dave's vocals are weak and Hagar sounds much better than Dave these days. Some of these songs are painful to listen to.<br /><br />Before writing this I have listened to this entire album about 35 times. It doesn't grow on you. It actually gets worse with extended plays. Time will tell, and a couple years from now people will be talking about what a turd this album is. It is just weak. Plain and simple. I hear no single on this CD at all. I hear no \\"Hot For Teacher\\" - no \\"Panama\\" - no \\"Aint talking bout love\\" - no \\"Eruption\\" - none of that. Instead we get \\"Bullethead\\"...\\"honeybabysweetiedoll\\"..and \\"The trouble with never\\" - really bad songs. Ugg. Production sounds cheap as well..flat.<br /><br />This album..after how many years? Wow. My guess is this will be their last. I give it two stars for \\"She's a Woman\\" because it sounds like classic VH (though too much Eddy) and the fact that I think \\"Tattoo\\" is somewhat catchy (though sounds more like something from an 80's DLR solo). I'm a huge music fan, and have been for 35 years. This is a lazy effort and I expected much better. Your mileage may vary, and if you are a HARDCORE to the death fan then you will love it because it's new, it's with DLR and it saw the light of day. BUt mark my words, this will not go down in history as a classic from VH. It will not be up there with the best these guys have put out in the past, because it is not even close.<br /><br />The Good<br />Well, they tried<br /><br />The Bad<br />Daves Voice<br /><br />The Ugly<br />Lyrics<br /><br />This one has now gone into limbo and will not get anymore play from me. Back to the classics. Two stars... from me..my opinion. Yours may differ but I suggest listening on spotify or the short samples on iTunes before a purchase. Wish I did!nd I expected much better.

0385534639|3.0|This book left me with mixed feelings. It most certainly has strengths, including rich and exquisite fantasies portrayed in a beautiful poetic language. Moreover, all the \\"beginnings\\" are unique, enchanting and promising: the beginning of the book, the introduction of each character, the conception of the main plot, etc. However, the pleasure is aborted soon afterwards, as the book falls more and more into verbal imagery replacing actual content. There are quite a few characters who have great potential (e.g. Chandrash, Alexander H., Marco), but they are left so undeveloped that it is difficult for the reader to care about any of them. Most of all, the main character, Celia Bowen, barely evokes any emotions in the reader. Unlike the inanimate objects in the circus, the book's characters lack in color and nuances, and the interactions are barren and superficial. At some point in the book, I felt that the author simply cannot carry her own story home.
B0071QIN00|4.0|Really cool app. It looks great...I like that there's a tilt option and a button option. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I suck at the game. :) great job!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|i love this book so much! i heard about this book from a few friends and fell head over heels for it.
B0071QIN00|5.0|Well made app.  Challenging and rewarding.  Fun once you get the hang of it.  Like the chick in the Santa suit
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love the gameplay. Be cool if it had option so player could destroy city instead of defending. Guess it wouldn't be called Missile Defender then.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is an entertaining mind work out. It can become joyfully addictive. I like it a lot and play it often as I can.
B00729GQ0A|2.0|I was excited for this one as it had 4.8 out of 5 stars, but now having read it, I'm not sure why. It's not bad, but it really isn't anything special either. It's basically all the same story elements you have read a hundred times before, but in a different order. In general, if feels forced and unoriginal.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|new to kindle fire and game apps. this game has a good variety of different games to try. looking forward to getting more of the games unlocked.
B002BWP49C|5.0|This movie is one of the best I have seen! When I went to the theater I was so excited. When I came out I was looking through every store to pre-order it.  I would suggest this movie if you like Romance and Drama, and Baby Renesme. It was Ah-Mazing!!!!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|this app is great as long as wi fi is available.  it is useless if you. want to use it in church or while waiting in line.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This APP is great to teach kids about the moon phases and tides.<br />We shared it with many friends worldwide.<br />THANKS AMAZON!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's pretty fun, but kind of frustrating. Still worth the free download, though. Just be prepared for the occasional awful controls.
B000002KFJ|4.0|What else can be said?<br /><br />Black Sabbath released Sabotage in 1975.  Though this album, in my opinion, isn't their best, it is nevertheless a very solid Sabbath album from the Ozzy era.  Ozzy, Geezer, Tony, and Bill are pretty much in top form.  Black Sabbath is known for their catchy hard rock guitar riffs, and this album provides many.  Songs such as \\"Megalomania\\", \\"The Thrill Of It All\\", and \\"Supertzar\\" are good examples.  These three songs also happen to be favorites on the album.<br /><br />This album is a must-own for all true Black Sabbath fans.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|Yes, one of the all-time greatest bands is back, and is at full throttle! It was 100%, absolutely necessary that David Lee Roth be back. Period. I love Sammy as a solo dude, but Van Hagar seemed like Sammy with a great backing band, instead of a great group all together. Dave makes this band Van Halen! The key is that Dave's crazy, three-ring circus vocals and attitude play off Eddie's mind-bending playing perfectly! I know that people miss Michael Anthony, and I do too. But, Wolfie does a very good job and keeps the rhythm section humming right along!  I know lots of people wigged out over \\"Tattoo.\\" But, I think it's a great record! It is definitely better if you hear it with a good sound system or headphones. Try it!  The rest of the album is loads of fun! I especially liked \\"Stay Frosty\\" and \\"She's a Woman.\\" Other excellent tunes are \\"Chinatown,\\" \\"Blood and Fire\\" and \\"The Trouble with Never.\\" You gotta love on \\"Blood and Fire\\" where Dave sings \\"Told you I was coming back, did you miss me?\\" then purrs \\"Say it like you mean it!\\"

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read over a hundred books a year. All genres. I don't give a 5 rating lightly. For me a 4 can be something great. A 5 is something that is great and stays with me long after I read it. This will stay with me. I was there with the characters and in that silo from the first few pages. I could feel every emotion, frustration, and even the physical sensation of being dizzy and tired from the trips through the silo. The story kept building and I wanted to know everything and couldn't put it down. Truly superior writing and storytelling. I can honestly say it was one of the best things I've ever read and makes what I thought were some pretty good books seem terrible now. . .I'm talking to you Hunger Games. I look forward to the day when this has its own movie too because it surely deserves it.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|The Cd is awesome. I love all songs on it. Worth the money and my favorite track is The Devil's Den and Summit. :)
B0052U59F4|5.0|I have never written a review before but I felt compelled to write one for this book. What can I say about the first book in this extraordinary trilogy. It was a fantastic rollercoaster ride - and I am so glad that I joined the party. The characterization was strong and consistent. The love story steaming hot - and there were laughs and a few tears along the way as we followed Ana's and Christians journey. A must read. Congratulations Ms James.
B0071QIN00|5.0|This game is probably the most awesome game on my Kindle Fire. The graphics are awesome, the game itself is awesome, everything is just awesome.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|It takes some balls to do a 180 and turn your back on the instrument that probably binds 99.9% of your fan base. To further up the ante, hire Timbaland for production and rethink the way you write songs. That about sums it up for Scream. If ever an established artist took two left turns it's got to be Chris Cornell.  And in all honesty...sorry guys, I'm loving it! I've got all the Audioslave records, the solo albums and Soundgarden's Superunknown, so it's not that I ran into Cornell for the first time with Scream, but I just flat out like this record.  The songs may be more poppy, the structures simpler, and the instrumentation more R&B/Hip Hop or whatever, but it works very well with Cornell's voice. There are a couple of tracks I skip when I listen to this album, but the bulk of it consists of strong material executed in an unexpected and original fashion. I'm not necessarily a fan of samples, loops, drum&bass programming and other synthesizer trickery, but if used well, it can add to the sonic landscape. While you can hardly say it was used in moderation here, Scream to me is an example where it somehow works. I'm not going to say it's brilliant, but it's catchy as hell, and I play it a lot... 4.5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a good little game combo, my children and I love sitting down and having little battles to see who can beat the others high scores. I admit there are many ads but still its a great way to spend time with the family.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|at first i was discouraged but then it turned the whole story around in a completely different way and if that isnt enough for you than ask yorself this is it worth it if a sixrh grader tells their english teacher to read this book and gets enough extra credit to brind up his grade from a c to an a
B004W4N55C|5.0|Love it! Especially all the options showing all the chords. Very nice. I got it when it was free and now see all the value.
B0036EH3U2|4.0|It took me about 3 weeks to finish watching this series.  I'm glad I waited to get it all at once.  Waiting 5 years would have been hard.  I did not have trouble with the BD not working, but two of them locked up in the middle.  After I reset my Panasonic player (only 4 months old and firmware current) it played okay.  Not sure what happened with that.  The very last movie, \\"The Plan\\", took the liberty of throwing in a few nude scenes, describing on the commentary that it was absolutely necessary for a realistic plot.  I would have given it 5 stars without the nudity.  Definitely not a kids show.
B0071QIN00|5.0|This is a fun game. Highly recommended. This game is not a waste of time. Difficult but very very fun.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read this book in one long afternoon. I couldn't stop thinking \\"how does a parent ever get through\\"- is there really such a thing as born evil? Jacob was a chilling character- I had to know did he or didn't he?  I am not a turn to the last chapter first mystery reader. My favorites are the books that don't give you the big reveal until the end. This book one of the best I've read.William Landay is an great find for me. I will be reading the books that went before & watching for what comes next. This book will be tough to top.

0671771833|5.0|Love love love the movie with Audrey so decided to read the book.  I think that fact it is based on a true story is great.  What else can you say.  Great service too from Amazon.
0439023491|5.0|After reading The Hunger Games, I couldn't wait to start reading Catching Fire.  I was a little bit wary, at first, wondering if this second installment could possibly be as good as the first.  Boy, was I surprised!  Not only was it as good, it satisfied my every need for more of Katniss and Peeta in this amazing book.  It takes you through every emotion.  From shock, anger, and sadness, to wonder, elation, and amazement.  Now that I've finished reading Catching Fire, I sense a craving, no, a lust, to read the final book in the series, Mockingjay.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is by far the greatest dictionary app out there, it also translates the words to many languages  so it's a very useful app to have.
1439192812|3.0|Richard Dawkins' book, The Magic of Reality, ostensibly for younger readers, does not impress. Unfortunately, Dawkins fails to connect with his audience and leaves them asking far too often, what point should I be getting here? Neither is his terse language counterbalanced in this volume; and, the disparity leaves the reader feeling as if something is lost. That something is Dawkins' typically entertaining wit (and charm); having been exchanged for gratuitous acrimony. Quite frankly, reading the book was tedious and far less satisfying than I had hoped.  In each chapter--with the exception of two--I think--Dawkins presents several descriptive accounts of the strangest myths ever concocted alongside Biblical narratives that he portrays as equally ridiculous. Ignoring the fact that these stories exhaust a large portion of the text--excessively so in my opinion--most of the analogies fail. For example: In chapter 10, relating to earthquakes, Dawkins writes of an ancient Chinese myth about a giant catfish, Namazu, upon whose back \\"the entire land floated.\\" When the behemoth flipped his massive tail, the whole earth trembled.  In another very strange tale he speaks of African peoples who believe they live on the head of a giant whose mighty sneezes cause the earth to shake violently. The trigger, of course: humans making a commotion in the giant's hair. Another legend yet recounts the travails of a dog pulling the earth across the bumpy universal terrain on a sleigh. Entertaining as they are, these depictions are quite dissimilar to the juxtaposed Bible stories  .  Dawkins consistently groups the aforementioned oddities with Biblical narratives on such topics as the fall of Jericho, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the salvation of Noah. Everyone who reads the book will immediately apprehend the strong disanalogies between these colorful legends and the Biblical narratives, which are at least comprehensible--some historically supported--even if the reader doesn't believe them. Moreover, the referenced Biblical accounts are not scientifically impossible, as Dawkins himself attests. The author's persistent attempts to equate these two classes appear disingenuous and mar the book for me.  One of the professor's strangest assertions is related to very tiny, nearly microscopic, creatures. Dawkins surmises, if dust mites were known to the ancients there would be religions about them? Since dust mites were not known, there were no worshipers. Aside from his illogical conclusion, the writer doesn't appreciate the fact that most religions--false or otherwise--usually surround ideas much greater than us, not objects that are infinitesimally small and presumably less significant.  Even if dust mites were well known, I wager that few religions would be based on them.  Another problematic and simplistic overture is found on pages 28 - 29. Here, Dawkins explicates the means by which a short legged frog population can, over time, be transformed into a long legged population--no mean feat--by selective breeding.  The author then proceeds to tell us that matching results may be achieved if the experimenter begins with an assemblage of newts. Dawkins seems to imply that these kinds of genetic metamorphoses occur regularly in breeding houses around the world. His just so proposal is quite the sleight of hand! It's the kind that permeates the entire theme of The Magic of Reality. Obviously no scientist has ever chronicled a newt population becoming a horde of frogs--or anything else for that matter. Moreover, selective breeding requires an intelligent agent, which is quite dissimilar to naturally occurring random mutation. Besides, why start with newts? Why not start with fish (or even lower forms) if novel creatures are so readily and swiftly elicited?  Despite all his criticisms of the supernatural, Dawkins happily pursues his own myths--the possibility of extraterrestrial beings his favorite.  The evidence in this narrative reinforces oursuspicion that something, or perhaps someone, is beyond what we now observe. The professor himself admits as much when he muses whether life--and by way of it our reason for existence--will be discovered elsewhere in the universe. Dawkins doesn't know if life will be found somewhere in a distant galaxy, many light years away. What he concludes definitively, however, is that no Creator will ever be revealed! This assertion is most astonishing in the face of his concession that some things may never be known.  For what it's worth, the book does explore some interesting topics.  Chapter 6, why do we have night and day, winter and summer?, is by far the most entertaining. I also enjoyed the latter portion of chapter 10. The section on plate tectonics contains easy to understand language and a number of excellent illustrations. If I were judging the book solely on these texts, it would easily get a thumbs up, both for educational and entertainment value. I also rather enjoyed the \\"greats-grandfather\\" chapter -- if only evolution were so linear -- which provides an interesting biological perspective on lineages that is not often captured at the popular level. Regrettably though, I can't recommend the book; there simply isn't enough magic to be found.
B0000844M8|5.0|Beautiful. Fascinating and touching relationship between the Author and the beautiful animal she rescued, Elso. A testimony of the strength and bond, yet the ability for all animals to return to the wild...I loved this book
0741470314|5.0|When considering the myriad of books, articles and television programs that have been released since Michael's passing, some people may wonder if there's anything new or compelling left to be said about his well-chronicled, remarkable life.  Well, I can assure you that Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy will give readers something unique: a never-before-told, inside story of what daily life was really like for the world's most famous person.  What Michael referred to as his \\"life in a fishbowl\\" will seem like an understatement when you've finished reading this exceptional book.  I was extremely impressed with the depth and breadth of Dr. Karen Moriarty's research. She supports her positions thoroughly and thoughtfully in each of the 19 chapters.  An emphasis on firsthand sources--including security staff and professional associates--adds a great deal of credibility throughout.  Additionally, I thought the book did an excellent job of clearing up the lies and misinformation repeatedly spread by the self-serving media.  Writing from a psychologist's perspective, Dr. Moriarty effectively describes the \\"why\\" behind the \\"what\\" regarding Michael's decisions, both as a public figure and as a father.  Conclusions are grounded in psychological theory, presented at an accessible level.  It was particularly interesting to learn about concepts such as compartmentalization and situational demand.  I came away with a better appreciation of how Michael Jackson was uniquely human, just like the rest of us.  One of the central themes across several chapters explores the duality of Michael's mission in life.  Almost everyone knows him for his unparalleled artistic excellence; however, the extent of his worldwide philanthropic involvement is equally impressive. The numerous examples given of Michael's random acts of kindness--often done anonymously--were both surprising and uplifting.  I think the assertion that Michael was someone, \\"...with a heart as big as his talent\\" says it best.  I highly recommend this book for anyone.  You'll learn more about the global icon and legend, while also realizing more about the man.  Michael Jackson changed history, and his influence is all around us.  His one-of-a-kind life is worth understanding.
0385474547|4.0|I was recommended to read this book.  It explained alot about their traditions but incorporated the arrival of Christianity and how it affected them.

B000GOVK8Q|1.0|Maybe if the director had lived long enough to edit his movie then it would have been better. Unfortunately the result is just a horrible film  The casting of Cruise was a mistake.  When I saw this in the theatre, the audience started screaming at the screen half way through the film. It was so horrible and being a long film it was just torture. Many people asked for a refund from the movie theatre.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Love this movie! Heath Ledger is buy far the best Joker there has ever been. The Blueray version is so much better than [[ASIN:B001OGWY1W The Dark Knight]] . In the mood to watch it now!!
0790737345|5.0|I can't say it enough and so I'll say it again.  What a beautiful movie. What a beautiful movie. What a beautiful movie.  Everyone over the years has already given their complete descriptions of what this movie is all about and so I won't repeat the same.  I'm simply here to express how it made me feel.  Sorry for my lack of words, but words simply cannot describe the emotion and the love felt from watching this.  One simply has to watch it without any distractions to know what I mean.  Now I want an angel like Nicolas Cage. ;)

B004UID2LC|4.0|Works great, the ads aren't in the way. The only thing is the presentation and maybe the download speed. I know I can't expect much more in the presentation but I'd like something. The download speed isn't really that bad but I figured I should comment on it for people who demand an app that downloads instantly.
B0071QIN00|4.0|Enjoying this new version of the game. Definitely a step up from the first version. The new encouraging cheers are a bit of a gag but all in all kind of fun. Appreciate the new jump button!

B001QWBM62|2.0|I purchased this item new. Within an hour of opening the box and handling with absolute care I found that the very flimsily made plastic hook holding the battery door closed had broke off after I put the batteries in for initial use.  I'm sure this unit will deliver the goods in recording ability, but the build quality is sub-par at best. It feels cheap and plasticky. For nearly $300 of my earnings I expect more.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|We're hooked to see what happens next on Downton Abbey.  Great series that is a compliment to Upstairs Downstairs showing the evolution of society in early 20th Century England.  The acting must be good since you come to despise some characters while fully embracing others.  Well done.

B006UG90RM|1.0|folks -  Today's news was the saddest VH day I have known since I was born.  The first I learned of the peppy, clear-cut, outstanding, and astonishing music of VH was back in 1977.  Walter M's Rock'n Grill was the real deal.  Dude - I saw these cool cats back in 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82 (seen all the warm-up bands boo-ed off like no body's business) 84.. and even the decent but cheesy Hagar days, made a stand.  When the Greatest Hits album hit the stores with the real Dave with Cant Get This Stuff No More and Me Wise Magic... I had real hopes for the boys.  However, It seems Ted Templeman is long-time missed and needed badly!!!  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD...  WHAT HAPPENED TO HALEN??????  What used to be clear cut awesome easy hard rock tunes, throughout each song you could depend on deciphering the bass guitar, lead & rythm guitar, drums (despite Big Al's incessant cymbals), and Dave's vocals...  Now, like nobody's business, it clearly is a blurr.  UGHHH!  Remember VH-3? The dude(Jerry C) from Extreme, rocked!  but when their weirdo producer got them together, they sucked green donkeys.  Get the Funk Out will hold its own with any band. So why the same prob with VH all over again?  Duhhhh?  Lame producers.  They are all great musicians.  But together, they sound like poop unless you have a Ted Templeman to make it all happen.  I am saying this as there is no other excuse for strike frickn THREE!  The guitar, the bass, the Eddie, and as always, the Alex, sounds like they are all playing without a single theme.  Listen to the first 4/5 albums (cd's).  Listen to the next...  UGH!!!  Would you buy a concert ticket without being a fan of their early days?  Hell no!  Whoever is their current producer has them sniffing some serious frickn glue!  They Suck!  Tattoo tattoo...  Paleeze paleeze...  A couple on amazon sound kinda like they are worth listening to, but the rest?  are you kiddn me?  I heard motley crue has a killer show in vegas....  damn.  here is your coaching you stubborn vh boys:  Keep the theme peppy:  people need that and that is what made you.  partying, fun, pretty girls, clear  lyrics, guitar, drums, etc.  now your stuff sounds like blended crap...  (go back, listen. give us what we want, or go broke.  Douches.)  I used to worship you guys.  now, damn, what a waste.  all out of egos and misdirection.  Do you miss that money of days gone by?  THEN STEP UP TO THE PUMP and deliver!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Sam Danger of Scottsdale AZ - still, your biggest fan!
1904994768|1.0|What can I say, picked this up at a garage sale. Upon opening the book it was very clear why it was there. It is a very lazy effort, with mostly records such as \\"Best Selling __________\\" or \\"First ___________\\".  Some of the lists provided are things that are subjective and are strangely places in a record book. Most of these lists also seem to lean toward the promotion of current games. If you are looking for something meaningful to an actual gamer stay away, if you are looking for an advertizement in book form then this is right up your alley.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I have to admit that I vacillated on buying this CD. I did not like what I heard in the snippets.  Mr. McCartney does not have the same voice he had 30 years ago, and it really didn't seem suited to this type of music. What tipped me over the edge was listening to My Valentine on youtube (the complete song).  He still sounded old, but the haunting melody captured me - I had to own a copy.  It arrived and I listened to the whole CD straight through, and could see some merits right away: great musicians (I am a Diana Krall fan, BTW), beautiful arrangements, and superb recording (I also consider myself an audiophile).  Oh, and the melodies on every one of the songs are captivating.  By now I've listened to it about 10 times, and I am absolutely in love with it!  After getting familiar with it, I see that Paul's voice works quite well on these songs - adding great character to the songs, and he really does sing with oodles of emotion. My advice: forget it's Paul when you listen, or at least don't be looking for the singer of Yesterday or Hey Jude.  This is absolutely not the Paul McCartney you know. It's just this old jazz man singing his heart out.  Buy it, but be patient with it. Let it grow on you.  Now, the songs...  1. I'm Going to Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter - a bouncy track to start the show a real catchy tune. Paul is the star, but Diana Krall's combo also stands out. To a large extent, this is a Diana Krall album - albeit with a different vocalist than she normally uses.  2. Home (When Shadows Fall) - A bit more syrupy (and I mean that in a good way), a sleek, romantic song with a modest use of strings in the background.  3. Paper Moon - Although this is perhaps my least favorite track, it's still a pleasure to hear this catchy tune.  Simple arrangement with guitar, Mrs. Costello's piano work and a fiddle standing out.  4. More I Cannot Wish You - Very romantic and pretty.  5. The Glory of Love - A very slow rendition of this familiar tune, sung with sweet emotion. Paul makes it his own with his own unique interpretation. By now, there's no doubt that Paul knows what he's doing. Paul overdubs a  harmony to his melody toward the end - subtle, as befits the song.  Among the best tracks in the collection.  6. We Three (My Echo, My Shadow, and Me) - Another cute song with a pretty melody.  7. Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive - An uptempo number, which fits Paul's voice and style perfectly. His best vocal on the album from a technical perspective (although I prefer the more emotional vocals, such as on the next two tracks). A bit more use of overdubbed harmony (two Paul's are better than one, now aren't they?)  He doesn't sound his age on this track.  8. My Valentine - One of two original compositions by McCartney on the album.  Absolutely beautiful melody, among the best he's ever written.  Paul sings it in a very heartfelt manner; clearly it was written for his bride. Eric Clapton plays his guitar on this track, and he does a fine job playing in the background, and with a brief solo.  I'll be surprised if this song isn't re-recorded by many others over the years ahead.  9. Always - My absolute favorite track.  Paul's best vocal, dripping with emotion - and infectious.  It almost makes me cry (the thought occurs to me: Paul and I are both getting up in years, but I'll be loving Paul, always). The arrangement includes strings that reinforce the sentimental mood set by Paul's singing. Worth the price of the CD all by itself.  10. My Very Good Friend The Milkman - a happy, fun song. The whole tone is happy, from Paul's whistling to the bouncy melody. Paul has always been adept at laying out the sequence of tracks and the happy tone of this song works out as a welcome respite after the heavy emotion of the prior to tracks, and the one that follows.  (BTW, he laid out the track sequencing on that little known album called Sgt. something-or-other).  11. Bye Bye Blackbird - My second favorite track. This is a slow, emotional version of this song. Everyone's heard this song before, but it's nearly always a fast, snappy version.  Paul provides a unique interpretation, happy/sad and slow- his voice full of meaning. I particularly like Paul's singing on the last few bars; very pretty. What is it about this guy and Blackbirds?  12. Get Yourself Another Fool  - The bluesiest song on the album. I envision Paul singing this in a smoke-filled bar, leaning over Diana's piano - drink in hand.  13. The Inch Worm - A pretty little song. Not a real standout, but nicely done.  14.  Only Our Hearts - The other original McCartney composition.  The lyrics are a bit bland for my taste, but the melody is pretty.  I actually think the strings are a little overdone here. Stevie Wonder does a very nice job on harmonica.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Just what I was looking for. This is a very functional app with many great features. I especially like the reading plans that are available.
B005ORVMT2|5.0|Well, not a newbie, really.  I always liked them, I saw them once back in the 70s, and I had a copy of 2112, but other than that I'm really only familiar with what's gotten radio airplay. When these box sets came out, it seemed like it was time to catch up.  I've been reading that some of these discs had problems, so I figured I'd just sit down and play the box to make sure it's ok, and hear a lot of new-to-me Rush.<br /><br />Disc 1 - Rush - I think the last time I heard this all the way through in one sitting, it was a 8-track...  The remaster sounds great to my ears.  Very clear sound, and really, quite a bit better music than I thought it would be.  Good stuff.<br /><br />Disc 2/3 - Fly By Night - WOW!  The 5.1 channel DVD audio disc is amazing.  Channel separation is very good, and Lee's vocals sound just like he's in the room.  \\"Fly By Night\\" \\"In The End\\" and \\"Rivendell\\" especially stand out... Still getting used to music mixed in 5.1 rather than two channel stereo.  I'm accustomed to crowd noise and building echo from the rear channels, if anything.  Wickedly cool to hear a guitar come tearing out of the back corner of the room. I think with this DVD, the CD won't get played much :)<br /><br />Disc 4 - Caress of Steel - \\"Bastille Day\\" is a familiar tune, and sounds great, and \\"The Necromancer\\" is appropriately spooky.  I'm really impressed with the clarity of the sound on this set so far, but then I'm not familiar with the previous issues to compare them to...<br /><br />Disc 5 - 2112 - The 2112 overture makes me smile every time I hear it.  This is the first Rush album I remember listening to, and probably still my favorite one.<br /><br />Disc 6 - All The World's a Stage - The live release from 1976.  Very good performance, with live versions of songs selected from the above releases.<br /><br />I guess I got a glitch free copy.  I have no complaints, and will definitely be picking up the other two \\"Sector\\" sets.  A word about the packaging.  I like this trend toward a plastic sleeve in an old-school LP type cover.  They take up less space, and they won't arrive damaged as often as jewel cases do.  Overall, I don't have any complaints here.  Great!They take up less space, and they won't arrive damaged as often as jewel cases do.  Overall, I don't have any complaints here.  Great!

B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Just finished this one and really liked it. Left me reeling and screaming out NO! I will have to wait to find out what happens next! Hope the author writes the sequel quickly so I can find out, because I'm so going to dive into the next one for this series. Was genuinely pleased with Marissa Meyer's writing and her resourcefulness and imagination in weaving a completely new personality using some elements from the beloved Cinderella fairytale, but still managing to make it fresh, interesting, and thrilling. This one will not disappoint.

0451228375|2.0|I loved The Pillars of the Earth, so was really looking forward to this sequel. Unfortunately, I found the story too repetitive and confusing. Ken Follett  is a great writer, and I love his style. But I found his story way too long, and I was quickly losing interest. Amazingly, I stopped short of finishing the book by some 100 pages. I just couldn't get myself to finishing the book. Here are the reasons why:  The plot is weak  The story repeats itself  The book is too long  Nothing thrilling or unexpected twists  No suspense  The book reads like a biography of the characters.  Good points:  Very well written  Characters come alive  Verdict: I like reading entertaining books that both thrill me and educate me. This book fell short of those requirements.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|As soon as I purchased my Kindle Fire, I ordered this cover because I was worried about me....or my son dropping it. This is a pretty neat cover. It's really sturdy and I like how you can turn it into a stand to watch movies.....Great buy!
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I've tried a few VNC apps for Android, and none were particularly stable on my modest Virgin Mobile LG Optimus V handset.  As such, I was starting to suspect I'd just have to settle for the least buggy.  However, I remember a client who was using TeamViewer at his work, and was impressed at how well it worked on their tablets.  I figured I'd at least give it a chance.  I'm glad I did, as this was rock solid.  Even with my phone's a modest screen, CPU and 3G connection, I was able to effectively remote control my home computer.  On a decent wireless connection, I was surprised at how smooth it rendered the screen.  I don't need it for anything important, but it's nice to be able to check on my home laptop while I'm away, and TeamViewer on Android is just the tool for the job!
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I had a lot of fun watching Rango, though little kids won't get all the film references (especially Chinatown). Not to worry, excellent animation, a first for ILM, and terrific characters, all endearing, led by a confident and sincere Johnny Depp. It's all about good and evil, and good intentions not always well-planned. Poor Rango...will he survive?<br /><br />It's loaded with great stock characters from classic films of yore, and some moments of ILM brilliance had you on location, a bit of realism added to the mix. I'm glad I watched this film, since many critics didn't like it. It's since won most of the Animated Feature awards, after Tintin's disqualification for being action/play.<br /><br />Maybe not the greatest, but I especially liked the references to Chinatown, Toy Story, spaghetti westerns (with an appearance by a simulated Clint Eastwood), The Milagro Beanfield War, and many others. Film freaks will have a field day guessing, while enjoying a terrific ensemble cast having nothing but fun. Little kids may not get the cleverness of it all, but the good vs evil element may be a fine lesson; also a good lesson about integrity.<br />The non-intrusive musical moments were quite enjoyable.<br /><br />I apparently got more out of it than most...

B006E0PVI6|3.0|It's difficult to get a real picture of Steve Jobs from listening to this narrator.  He has such a nasal and negative tone when he reads.

B00002663R|1.0|This is the most overrated album ever. Virtually every track sounds the same and all MJ fans are so one-eyed that they will not hear a word against this piece of nonsense. When Thriller was released in the U.K it entered the album charts at number 11 and did not move many people but as soon as a daft video and a load of good publicity stories about sleeping in oxygen chambers, etc everyone went out like a load of sheep and bought this tripe. Wake up people as there are so many more albums out there to buy other than this.

B0053KWDES|5.0|I purchased this amp to replace the Fiio E6.  All I can say is it is wonderful.  The amp is constructed very well and solid.  It is portable, and very user friendly.  It delivers wonderful warm bass at low or high listening levels.  I have the amp connected to the Jabra Bluetooth 3030, into Westone 2 dual driver IEM'S.  The 3030 allows a wireless connection with my IPad.  I listen to all types of music from classical to hip hop and the amp makes the Westone's sound incredible.  For all true audiophiles welcome to pure pleasure at a reasonable price.  The only issue is a slight hum between songs and when no music plays.  Will update review once I figure out.  I would again like to think Amazon and it's retailers for a fast, free, delivery.  Figured out how to get rid of that hiss or hum.  Follow instructions and remove battery case than battery.  Change the voltage selection switch to low and the hiss or hum is gone.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I've played this game a lot on the computer and am very familiar with it. When I go to move a section of cards they won't go where I put them and I end up moving them sometimes more than once which increases my score. I've just downloaded the game so for now will up with it.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I used this amp connected to a Jabra Bluetooth 3030 with Westone 2 dual Driver IEM'S with my IPAD.  The controls are  simple and easy to use.  It is very compact and portable.  I have replaced it with the Fiio E11 due to wanting more bass at a lower listening level.  The E6 works great and overall really made the Westones hum.  My only issue was the lack of punch in the bass at lower listening levels which is just personal taste.  I have nothing negative to say about the amp.  Charges easy and is very user friendly.  If you want overall ampllfication of your music this is a great entry level amp.  Thanks amazon for the great service and fast delivery.
B006VRZ5YM|4.0|When I first saw the previews for this, I thought that it would never be a movie that I would want to see.  However, I happened to see it at the video store (yes, I'm one of the view that actually still go to the video store) and grabbed it because there was nothing else that I wanted.  I am so glad I did.  From the start of the movie, I was laughing nonstop.  The comedy featured in this movie (which leans toward raunchy) isn't my usual style of comedy but for some reason, it really worked.  What I do like about this movie is that neither of the leads are \\"perfect\\".  There are so many rom-coms out there that make everything seem perfect, etc but this movie doesn't try to do that.  Yes, the ending is predictible but what rom-com ending isn't?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I found this book fantastic. Characters were likable. The plot keeps you on the edge of your seat. I found myself reading at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning. Read the book in about two days. A MUST read.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|Some guy named Eddie posted a review saying if John Lennon were alive, he'd be laughing at Paul for doing this CD. Quite possibly, yes, he would be. But that's because John would never do such a project like this. Paul has always been known more for his lighter pop songs and was never afraid to experiment with different genres starting in the Beatles and continuing into his solo career. Coming from someone who gave us \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\", \\"Honey Pie\\", \\"She's Leaving Home\\", \\"You Gave Me The Answer\\" and \\"Listen To What The Man Said\\", this is not a surprising move by Paul. He does seem to want to leave his mark on every musical genre and every art form that he can. John was happy just writting rock and pop songs with an occassional ballad, never veering too far away from the formula.  Other people have posted that Paul no longer has the voice to do such songs. I disagree. I think his voice fits what he's singing...maybe TOO much. That's arguably the one flaw that I find here. He sounds as if he's trying TOO hard to sound like a velvety smooth, breathy sultry singer. Not on every song. But it's there. He has said in an interview that, because of the great musicians playing on the CD, he felt he needed to step up to the plate and sing as good as they were playing. I think all he needed to do was just be Paul, and sing like Paul. It works when he sings \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\", or \\"Listen To What The Man Said\\". When he changes the sound of his voice to match the style of the song, as on \\"Honey Pie\\" or \\"You Gave Me The Answer\\" in my opinion it does NOT work. I STILL cringe when I hear those songs!  At least he waited, as he stated in the previously mentioned interview, to put this out after the craze had died down. For a time, just about everybody was putting out an album of standards, starting with Linda Ronstadt. All the way up to K.D. Lang (with Tony Bennett). Pauls' two compositions fit in nicely with the older tunes. I actually thought \\"My Valentine\\" was one of the older songs.  As I stated before, given his past music, this is not that much of a stretch. I like it better than some of his Fireman stuff. Now if John had tried to do something like this, even though he was my favorite Beatle, that would be something to laugh at.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|great game! every level is unique, it's challenging but not too difficult. pretty graphics and beautiful music also. very relaxing. it's worth the purchase.

0307957934|3.0|A novel is a thing unto itself.  A movie script is a stepping stone, a technical blueprint. Without having read any other Robert Harris books, I have no basis for comparison -- but this one, while quite readable (if one has some basic understanding of world markets), is a movie script masquerading as a novel.  The eventual film producers -- and there will be film producers -- may have Tom Stoppard cut it down and polish it up.  But they will save themselves time and money by giving the book to a film student with a word processor, who can do a fluff-ectomy and reformat what's left into a shooting script complete with a nice role for Jean Reno.  There are endless descriptions of things we don't need to know; historical-background ramblings that are well-written, but still quite tedious.  Lop out the obvious filler,  write \\"FADE IN\\" at the beginning and \\"FADE OUT\\" at the end, keep the taut, realistic dialogue, keep the vivid scene descriptions, the (all too occasional) energetic pacing and...voilá!  Roll cameras!  All that said, despite an important howler about the way email systems work and a couple of conveniently stupid characters who ought to know better, this is a highly readable book for anyone who \\"gets\\" arbitrage in the computer age.  The movie will be better, because that's what \\"Fear Index\\" was in the first place.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|This book was amazing. In the battles you feel like you are right there watching every explosive move. The characters are complex and after reading the book you feel a sense kinship with them leaving you wanting to know more.
0312944926|1.0|This will be short.  Hated this book.  Would have given zero stars. Maybe I've read a worse book, but none comes to mind.  The characters were wooden and unbelievable, the plot seems constructed by a kindergartner,  and the material about computers, cryptography, the NSA is nonsensical, unrealistic, and flat wrong.  The text was repetitive and I kept skimming hoping to get to something believable.  Never happened. I will definitely never read another Dan Brown book.  I've got a REALLY bad book taste in my mouth and I need to read something, anything, to get it out.
B004G6009K|5.0|I'll be honest, I really think I enjoyed this movie (at least the first time, in the theater) more than my 2 girls did.  It's grown on them now.  But, I really want to watch the movie again, and I'm not embarrassed to admit it.  Disney did a pretty good job of appealing to a range of viewers with this one, similar to Shrek (but not nearly as raunchy).  I found the mix of story (4.5), comedy(5+), action(4.5), romance (kid-rated) (3), and suspense(2.5) to be perfect.  Note, my kids really get freaked out by large amounts of suspense (they're 7 and under girls), and this was just about at their limit, but didn't cause them to run away or hide, so, just right.  Look to other reviews for extremely long, detailed reviews, I'm just K.I.S.S. on mine.  RECOMMENDATION:  buy new!
B0068MNO4S|2.0|Sounded intriguing, and great intro with Jacobi, but (after allowing for the fiction necessary to present their speculative lark) after you realize the only \\"historically accurate\\" thing in this movie is perhaps the CGI scenery, the whole thing lapses into a slow, tedious reinvention of the time based on our own projections and paranoias. The characters are caricatures and cliches and sometimes grossly slandered, albeit well acted. Wanted to see where this was all going but with no sympathetic characters to make me care, I gave up halfway.<br /><br />I hope no one thought they \\"learned\\" anything about history from this movie, not even about the period.
0525478817|5.0|The picture of the book was signed, and John Green said Amazon should have had enough signed copies to distribute. I would greatly like a bookplate that he will be sending to Amazon and Amazon UK for those who did not receive signed editions of the book.  Other than that, the book is utterly life changing. No matter how old you are. Read it.
B006W0QOF2|4.0|Strange vibe, with it's Miami Vice style credits and score. Slow moving but building up with dread and tension, which suddenly snaps in several scenes of brutal violence a la \\"A History of Violence\\". There is a stomping which is cringeworthy, although most of the violence is implied by sound and foot placement. Not as much stunt driving as expected, though - at least, nothing outlandish a la James Bond. Probably a plus as far as realism is concerned.<br /><br />The Driver is an enigma whose layers are peeled away (to some degree) as the film progresses. Brooks is lethal and scary. You've never seen him like this before.<br /><br />The ending is one of those \\"what the hell is he thinking\\" deals where you are squirming because you know something he probably doesn't.<br /><br />Good, but not for the squeamish.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is the best I finished the game in a few days. it is very easy plus when the candy falls he does a sad face it makes me cry sometimes
B00650SSWG|2.0|Tries too hard to be the next When Harry Met Sally with its quick-fire dialogue, which pales in comparison. Hard to like either of them until much later in the movie when they become more like human beings rather than dialogue robots. Her eyes are too big and catlike - looks unnatural. You should know already that this is not a family movie, but just in case ... It's not.<br /><br />Moderately entertaining.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is such a great game when you get bored, you have all these games to play. this is a great game.
B0062P3392|3.0|Is it a true story? I dunno. The premise is uncomfortable - arranging the murder of three SAS who are supposedly war criminals. An attempt at some sort of moral statement, maybe, but ...<br /><br />Danny doesn't want to do it, doesn't want collateral damage. His pals don't really care. So we get some interesting dynamics there.<br /><br />The murders, meant to seem like accidents, seem needlessly complicated and hard to believe.<br /><br />Some good cat and mouse with Clive Owen's ex-SAS character. The ex-SAS are shown as paranoid but not quite enough, or not skilled enough. I expected better.<br /><br />Worth a watch.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent app with many different versions.  Navigation is good.  Normally good enough for me to use it while following along with a sermon.  Definitely needs some way to take and store notes while offline -- preferably with a sync feature that synge up once I'm back online.

B004O3YGMC|4.0|It is a little bit choppy on the Kindle Fire, maybe a future update will smooth it out a little.  But, it is awesome to be able to access my computer at the office without getting the laptop out and waiting for it to start up.  Also, have the home computer set up now too.  I can stream my entire music collection from anywhere I have a wifi signal and not take up any storage on the Fire or the cloud.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I enjoyed this app for the most part. Some games are very easy, some not so. I was annoyed that the touch is not as sensitive as I would like on some games, but I am quite ADDICTED!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This is one of the best books I have read in years.  I am not one of those people who normally want books to keep going but this one I truly did not want to end.  Can't wait to read something else by Erin Morgenstern - I felt like she took me into a fairy tale world.  Thank you Erin for a wonderful journey...
0399156577|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I loved the relationship between Fiona and Simon, NR made it seem \\"real\\". I thought this was a good mix between two different scenerio's.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I've had a kindle for the last 4 years and in all that time this is only the 3rd book I've actually bought. I was intrigued by the fact that the books have been on the top 100 for so long since I look at it almost daily. I got a sample of the first book and I was totally hooked. It was amazing, so I went ahead and just bought the trilogy. The first book was on of the best books I've ever read. I loved the storyline, the romance, the characters, the Capitol lifestyle vs the districts everything was totally enthralling. The second book was good as well, and I loved the twists and the romance love triangle. However when I got the the third book....um....horrid comes to mind. The storyline was ALL about the war, Peeta was nonexistent for the first 2/3 of the book. Finnick's character was incredibly shallow I really thought it was handled badly. Also district 13 was so controlled and the way it was written I really had no idea what they were fighting for. District 13 seemed as bad as the capitol, the people seemed to have less freedom and no life AT ALL. It seems like they just wanted a regime change but what they wanted to change/accomplish was never clear. Coin's character/back story was never really developed and she felt a lot like a female Snow. My favorite part of the book was the end but it felt so rushed once the precious war was over, I really wanted to see how their lives regained normalcy, how the new government was working, what changes were made, how the love between Peeta and Katniss evolved and how the relationship grew....not just....after \\"it\\" was over he said \\"you love me, real or not\\", I mean seriously? The third book really fell short for me and I can only PRAY that the movies address some of the problems with the writing and take a bit of creative license to expand the real story, which is not the war, its the lives and relationships of the characters.

B006UG90RM|2.0|Van Halen digs up odds and sods dating back to the mid seventies, records them with the lead singer twice (yes, twice) fired, and suddenly all is forgiven by what is either the most forgiving or the most ADD fan base in popular music. It's no accident that nearly every note on this album conjures instant references to earlier works, or that some songs feel literally patched together with the barest afterthought of a bridge. Many of these scraps have been used before and the ones that weren't, weren't for a reason. Their former great producer, Ted Templeman, must have been the only \\"brother\\" who could reign them in - and without a doubt the result was no less than 6 of the greatest albums of the era. In these scraps Templeman undoubtedly heard what every listener will now hear: Great guitar work...no hooks. Not one \\"Jamie's Cryin',\\" nor one \\"Light Up the Sky.\\" Longtime fans will find no \\"Dance the Night Away,\\" but they will find the first run of the song which became \\"Mean Street.\\" True fans really should demand more, yet this fan base is so taken with the echoes of time gone by that all is forgiven and forgotten. I feel the same way about this album. I forgive them for slavishly relying on their past, and I can't remember a single one of these songs.

B005V2EVBQ|1.0|The Kindle Fire fit perfectly in the Marware Folio Cover and I was quite pleased. However, after a month of use, I noticed that my hands were turning black, the culprit being the dye from the cover was inferior. I have now removed the Folio Cover and will no longer use it. This turned out to be a waste of money. I always wait a while before writing reviews as sometimes the product just doesn't hold up.
0756404738|4.0|Patrick Rothfuss' The Kingkiller Chronicle is a fantasy series I liked a lot along with Robin Hobb's Farseer & Tawny Man trilogies and Peter V. Brett's Demon Cycle. It has two storylines about a famous wizard and fighter who became both hero and villain. The main arc is when he was known then as Kvothe, a poor and young but exceptionally talented orphan who entered the best university of magic and sought to avenge his parents' deaths by a legendary foe, while the other story is on the present alias Kote as he hides as an innkeeper and secretly fights demons.  I understand why many readers dislike it. It's not perfect for though the plot flows well on Day 1 (The Name of the Wind), the pace can be slow and protracted on Day 2 (The Wise Man's Fear), leaving many mysteries on both storylines to unfold at the end of this projected trilogy. Mr. Rothfuss' descriptions of his world are vivid and of sorrows and adventures reasonably engaging. Some parts feel adolescent and narcissistic with the main character arrogant and unbelievably near-perfect in every way yet likable, and the magics \\"Sympathy\\" & \\"True Name\\" while not unfamiliar (which I don't mind since it happens with most books) still are cool and fun.  I read this series non-stop almost a year ago and found it altogether easy not to be disappointed with its valid problems and difficult not to enjoy.

B0067QPVJ6|4.0|I was not expecting to like this movie but I watched it on On Demand and loved it. Creepy! Better than the 1952 original, which I still enjoy and much better than the Kurt Russell one.

B0024F08RO|5.0|why did it have to be the last season? it keeps you on the edge of your seat holding your breath and anxious to find out what's going to happen. One of the best series I have ever watched. this season is as good as the first one.

0756405890|4.0|Patrick Rothfuss' The Kingkiller Chronicle is a fantasy series I liked a lot along with Robin Hobb's Farseer & Tawny Man trilogies and Peter V. Brett's Demon Cycle. It has two storylines about a famous wizard and fighter who became both hero and villain. The main arc is when he was known then as Kvothe, a poor and young but exceptionally talented orphan who entered the best university of magic and sought to avenge his parents' deaths by a legendary foe, while the other story is on the present alias Kote as he hides as an innkeeper and secretly fights demons.  I understand why many readers dislike it. It's not perfect for though the plot flows well on Day 1 (The Name of the Wind), the pace can be slow and protracted on Day 2 (The Wise Man's Fear), leaving many mysteries on both storylines to unfold at the end of this projected trilogy. Mr. Rothfuss' descriptions of his world are vivid and of sorrows and adventures reasonably engaging. Some parts feel adolescent and narcissistic with the main character arrogant and unbelievably near-perfect in every way yet likable, and the magics \\"Sympathy\\" & \\"True Name\\" while not unfamiliar (which I don't mind since it happens with most books) still are cool and fun.  I read this series non-stop almost a year ago and found it altogether easy not to be disappointed with its valid problems and difficult not to enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this app because its fun and it haves lots of.fun other games too. I think you should get this app.
B000NQPZCY|5.0|A movie with a very realistic point of view. Nice scenery in Mexico. Gret actors: Anthony Quinn, and Kevin Costner, both really great actors. If you are a fan of Costner like me, you'll enjoy this movie in blu-ray.
0071762345|3.0|There are 169 reviews on Amazon for this book and 165 of the reviewers gave this book 4 stars or 5 stars.  I give it 3 stars.  Only one person gave it a lower rating than I gave it.  I just don't see how it merits more than 3 stars.  That's not to say that it's not a good book or that I didn't get something out of it.  There were some good examples used.  In general, I agree with almost everything the author had to say.  But when I got done reading it, I realized that I hadn't bookmarked many passages.  I realized that for the most part, things I already thought or already knew might have been reinforced, but I wasn't really asked to think about anything in a new way.  Also, I should add that, due to my profession, I tend to rate books higher when they are applicable to smaller businesses.  Many of the examples used in this book were more applicable to larger brands. I'm not sure that people who run small businesses would get much usable strategy from this book.  Also, not that it impacted this review, but when I went to the facebook page for the author's business--a small business--the only real reference to local businesses contained one link...and it was a broken link.  To be fair to the author, I pointed it out in a facebook message, to which he replied very quickly.  Not sure if it is fixed.
B005PTQPU0|4.0|Say what you will about Kate Bush, but once she gets an idea in her head there is just no stopping her.  Instead of dreaming about sensual worlds or wearing red shoes, this time around the concept of snow got in her brain and from there it appears that was all the inspiration she needed for her latest work.  This is Kate being Kate and we couldn't be happier.  \\"50 Words\\" has everything we've come to expect from her, and what we expect is far more than what's expected from most normal artists.  Kate has a unique way of painting a scene scape with her arrangements and the scenes in \\"50 Words\\" are rich, textured, and beautiful. But then again, that's what she does and no one does it better.  In fairness the album starts out on the weak side.  The first two songs are not the best on the album and I don't know what she had to eat before she recorded the vocals because that's the voice we've become used to.  She has sounded much better in the past. But things really pick up with \\"Misty\\", a song that will go down in the annals of Kate Bush's songwriting as one of her very best.  The song is followed by \\"Snowed In At Wheeler Street\\", which is a duet with Elton John.  We have go back to \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\" with Kiki Dee since we've heard Elton do a duet so good.  Ok, I'm kidding about that but it's a beautiful love ballad.  Things get a bit weird in a good Kate Bush kind of way with the title song, but the album finishes with the exquisite \\"Among Angels\\" which is in the \\"Misty\\" category of excellent.  Kate Bush is a singular talent.  No one past or present sounds like her, and no one ever will.  She is her own category.  \\"50 Words For Snow\\" is a worthy addition to her gallery of art.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have invested some time into this app. I cant imagine how rewarding it will feel when I unlock all the games. they remind me of the touch games at the bar.
B001U887WE|1.0|was very excited to get these.  have worn them about five times.  they make an awful noise with each step i take.  it's embarrassing.  I spent me Christmas gift card on these.  what a disappointment!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time and I've had my share of books. Haven't had one calling my name every time I have to walk away from it (bathroom, eating, sleeping). I dreamt of killing people and starving for a week and a half until I completed the series. So its also a great way to lose weight! Can't wait for the movie. Great, great read.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It wasn't super easy for me because this is only the second point and click game I've played. It was challenging without being frustrating. Definitely recommend! I hope they make lots more of these.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun. you never run out of games to play. this game will last you hours and hours of fun.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I had absolutely no idea what Drive was about before watching, just a recommendation from my brother and praise from Ed Brubaker (Criminal, Incognito).  My expectations were low after noticing most cheers for the movie were coming from women who couldn't stop talking about how hot Ryan Gosling is.  I expected something along the lines of a Fast & Furious meets Gone In 60 Seconds (remake).  I now see why Drive is getting so many 1 star reviews, I think a lot of people may have expected what I was expecting but unlike them I'm very happy with what I got.  This is what gritty, hard-boiled crime movies should be.  Can those snappy one-liners, can as in put a lid on it!  This is all story, it's not about the cars (notice the lack of spoilers and florescent lights), the movie sticks to the script and it's not a difficult story to follow.  The shoegaze music and flashy scenery might get under the crime purist's skin but they'll find plenty to smile about after the credits roll.  If you like noir, classic crime novels then I urge you to check this out!
B0063GORYU|5.0|when you get bored this is definitely a game to play. If ur in a waiting room and your bored out of your mind play this game.
B0071QIN00|5.0|Upon playing the 1st level I immediately thought of Excitebike from the days of NES. Runs perfectly on my SGSII SkyRocket. Options for Tilt OR Buttons are nice. Free Apps of the Day should have a donate button.
B0063GORYU|5.0|downloaded this as the app of the day. its way fun and works great on the kindle fire. I recommend it highly
B0071QIN00|1.0|Offers his trial on Amazon free app of the day. Free apps on Amazon are suppose to be full versions.  bogus
B005R32L66|1.0|I read the reviews for this skype app, and even though most of them said it didn't work well, i figured it was free and i had nothing to lose. it didn't install on my Android cruz T301 tablet. I siggest not to get it. it will not work.
B005COO1X6|2.0|The book starts out great, classical King start, but with a childish slant to it which was ok given the main character.  It was a easy read to really get into.  HOWEVER, once you get to the craptastic ending, it makes you soo mad for how completely stupid it was ended!  Not impressed, or happy.  I expected a way better ending than what was given.
B005LAIGSC|3.0|Denzel Washington once again stars as the wise, aging professional tutoring a young up-and-comer. This time it's Ryan Reynolds trying to atone for his green-suited comic book hero. The good news is that they both succeed in their roles for the most part. There isn't much new here. We have Tobin Frost (Washington) who is a rogue intelligence agent that is hunted by some bad guys and of course the CIA. As a way of escaping the bad guys he walks into the American consulate in Cape Town, South Africa. After a little water boarding he is taken to a \\"safe house\\" which is managed by Matt Weston who is bored out of his mind and looking for a little action. Well, he gets it with both barrels.<br /><br />The wrinkle in this espionage thriller is that someone within the CIA is on the take and is alerting the bad guys as to Tobin's whereabouts. Pretty quickly we know it is likely one of two people. Go ahead and flip a coin. You'll have a 50/50 chance of guessing correctly. Why does everyone want Tobin's head? Well, he has a little microchip which contains the names of intelligence operatives who are selling information to the aforementioned bad guys. Matt and Tobin become unlikely allies in their attempt to stay alive. We get plenty of well done car chases, gun fights, close quarter fisticuffs and ghetto roof-top chases that we expect. And they are all tension filled. Some of the quick-cut editing was a bit disconcerting at times but I think that was just Swedish director Daniel Espinosa's style.<br /><br />The cast is supplemented by Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga and Sam Shepard as CIA higher-ups. While obviously I think the film has its share of flaws and been-there-done-that action, I have to say I got caught up in it and certainly was never bored. If you've had your fill of espionage thrillers, skip it as there's not much new. But if you need a little adrenaline rush, go for it. \\"Safe House\\" will keep your attention.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I don't like that it requires wifi and that this one costs, even though it's only 99&cent; lol. But the game is awesome!
