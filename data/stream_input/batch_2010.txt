B00846REIS|4.0|I couldn't put it down & now I can't wait to start the next one!  I loved the chemistry between them!
B00992CF6W|5.0|ITS JUST AMAZING.... I love the experience of this feeling game type. I love the way the world just forms. Definitely worth $6.99
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|idk where everyone is getting all this misinformation.  i dont have a smart tv but my blu ray player picked it up right away. i just skipped the fb login, and it took me directly to stream videos. i DID NOT have to pay anything. likei said, I'm not sure where everyone is getting their info, but if youre trying to stream it to a tv with no wifi, thats your problem. both devices have to have wi fi and be on the same network. i thought everyone who had these types of products knew that already!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it so much!!! I predicted the plot about halfway into the book but I loved how the story unfolded!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was an amazing game. I played it so much that I beat it in one day. I highly recommend this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game makes me miss my horses can't stop playing this.. you do everything like u would with a really horse
B007TNS6JI|5.0|At first I was worried that this game wouldn't be very good due to the varying reviews, but after installing the extra data, (totally worth the time for the amazing graphics) I was shocked by how much I could buy and do! There are pages of things to buy and you don't need to spend any real money! Overall, this game is definitely a grand slam!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Plan on being hooked. Nearly everyone should be able to relate to someone in this character set. Envy, pride, honor, love. It's all there....and more. Great fun.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|Once into it, being a lover of bookstores I lived inside the adventure for awhile.  Sorry to see it end.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the best I've ever read. Very believable. I hit the jackpot with this one because I am so thirsty for us to venture there. This book satisfied my craving . Gosh and so funny!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a fantastic book. Would recommend for everyone! This book made me laugh and cry... and was also very real.
1609611543|4.0|I like to read lots of different books about nutrition and food. I'd read all the reviews for this one before i bought it. Took some of the criticisms with a grain of salt and decided to see for myself. I enjoyed reading it. While I'm not gluten-intolerant and wouldn't go the extremes to avoid ALL wheat wherever it is found, I would like to lose some weight and so have been able to make some modest modifications to my diet. I've replaced whole wheat bread with pumpernickel, which ranks lower on the glycemic index scale.I'm really trying hard to eliminate pasta from my diet, and after reading the book stopped trying to make myself eat whole wheat pasta, which I'm not really crazy about. I am much more conscious of other hidden sources of wheat in my diet and try to monitor my intake. I'm also trying to reduce sugar in general from my diet, something I allowed to creep up over the years becus of a perception that Kozy Shack rice pudding was &#34;healthier&#34; than ice cream, cake or cookies. Too much sugar. And if you really want to be shocked by sugar content in a supposedly healthy food, take a look at the sugar content in Stonyfield organic yogurts. Wow.<br /><br />Anyway, this book is easy to read and quite interesting. The author provides a lot of helpful information toward the closing chapters on how to incorporate his suggestions into your diet.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Love playing this game, but as soon as I zap the last blocks, then Game Over and it tells me I have a new high score but doesn't show the score. I wonder if I'm the only one who wants to know the numbers? Only because of this issue I give it 4 stars.<br />Edited 5 hours later: The Cubisty guys emailed me (at my request) and let me know that if the Timer is turned off, then you don't a get a score.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Love this movie. I remembered it as funny when I was a kid and seeing it again i was not disappointed.
B00961ZGQC|5.0|my wife really likes this song, our kids like to dance to it. I could care less but they like it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Classic game brought to the 21st century. The game has a clean and simple look. I like the different dealing options.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great Game!!! I love to play minecraft on he PC but with this I can play where ever and it doesn't use WI FI!!! Of course there isn't all the features and updates like pc because it's an app but its okay! Mojang also updates this monthly so there is still some stuff that's going to be added. All in all great app get if you like adventure and building stuff.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is likely the best game I've played on Android so far, free or otherwise. The endless supply of missions adds a lot of replay value, and you never have to buy anything to progress, although it does make coin collection faster.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I love this game. I will tell my friends about this game. I didn't have any issues with it. I like all games like this.
B005ZR2D0I|5.0|Helene is superb! She plays Mozart with tremendous skill and great artistic interpretation, not just mechanical.<br />Very inspiring and uplfiting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|such a great game it never crashes is superb rocks rules and it is the best free game of all time<br />l
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|The Descendants<br />. This movie was very touching.  The love of family and heritage is more important than money and handling difficult descions in a difficult situation.
B007K3JFUQ|1.0|Having watched the first one of these two versions of SH, and finding the first one absolutely terrible, slow, and mind numbing...all the reviews pointed to this one being far better.  Nope....not so.  As a matter of fact, this one is worse.  The story is all over the place and simply makes no sense.  The pace is plodding and just so bad I could not sit through the entire film...made it about 1 hour 15 minutes before I gave up.  Even if it got better, I really don't care.  The first half was that much of a disaster....why bother?  Save your money and go to the library to get this if you must...which is what I did so I don't feel bad about wasting real cash here.  The quality was great, sound quality was great and colors just fine....ruined by a terrible script, bad directing and boring story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The greatest book ever written.  The source and breath of my life.  I use the Holy Bible in my day to day life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It helps me to pass tine when I'm at an appointment and I like the fact that the kids can play this to.
B004GYY714|5.0|Tubein Radio.<br />This product allows me to listen to my local radio station while at work.  Thank you for this product
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|This was always my favorite version of Moulin Rouge.  Glad to now have it in my possession for the subsequent versions are not up to par.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is an excellent read!! I would recommend this book to anyone! I couldn't put the book down! I couldn't wait to get off of work to read it.
B00ABXA1HI|2.0|I did not like it.  Do not recommend it and have removed it from the kindle.<br />not worth it at all
B00992CF6W|5.0|I begged my mom and she said yes and I was freaking out! I started out in survival and I was like die zombies! it is the best I repeat best game ever made. Thank you notch! ( I think)
B00AVPYT8I|2.0|I have downloaded 2 other apps for free books that work excellent. This app will not even connect most of the time. I get it to connect once or twice a week. The rest of the week it just sits there trying to connect to server. This is the only thing on my kindle that does not work great. When it connects I have gotten a couple of good books. I just wish it would work all the time.
0345535413|5.0|I was hooked from book 1. This series stands as my favorite in the world of Fantasy.<br />I've read each of the books at least twice. Each time I read them, I find little things I missed before.<br /> Yes, it's taking a l-o-n-g time for Mr. Martin to teel his tale, but I can wait for as long as he takes. I don't understand all these cries of, &#34; Finish it, already&#34;.  WHY ? Are you folks going somewhere?  What's the rush to end it ?  This is like a fine wine. Make it last, Breathe it in. Savor it. I can't imagine a story like this appearing again for a very long time.<br /> The intrigue alone is enough to keep me coming back for more and more.<br /> Truth be told - I can't wait for the next book - but I will - and gladly buy it right away to see what's going on in the world of Dragons and Kings and Queens  and Others !<br /> Bravo, Mr. George R.R. Martin, Magister Supreme. I have theories to prove - or not...
0988262592|4.0|I blew through this, first in the extended preview (available from the itrevolution press website), and then the kindle book.  While the characters are a little thin at times, they were so instantly recognizable from my life, that I was able to fill in the detail myself.  If you're not involved in IT at all, that may be harder.<br /><br />The cluster**k of a situation that starts the book, well, that could have been cribbed straight from my last job.  Going from the hell I know, to a heaven I'd like to, kept me involved all the way through.<br /><br />Seeing the concepts applied, and grown from initial need to more full systems made things make far more sense to me than I've gotten from straight management books.  I am not an IT manager, just a sysadmin, but this book helped make a lot of management goings on make far more sense to me.  Both in the pre-good days and in the good days to come.  (I'm seeding copies of this in my boss' office, and several other execs as well)
0756655307|5.0|purchased this for my son who is a Marvel collector and will share it with his students! Prompt delivery and worth every penny!
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun to watch. At one point of the movie my daughter did get a little upset (teary eyed) but it passes as quickly as the scene and she wanted to watch the movie again a few more times-I thought the movie was very cute:)
B000063Y8F|5.0|This garlic press is made in Heaven! No, really! I have arthritis in my hands and couldn't use the old standard garlic press anymore without significant pain. With this press all I have to do is toss a few cloves inside, squeeze gently and the built-in design of the press does the rest. No peeling required, but sometimes I peel anyway so there's less waste. Besides being so completely simple to use it has the added bonus of being able to completely eliminate all traces of garlic smell from your hands. Just swish it all over your hands while rinsing under water and voila! no more garlic smell on your skin!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Pendergast is a fascinating character and written with the perfect strengths and flaws. Every Preston/Child collaboration is better than the last!
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I'm absolutely satisfied by this album. After 7 long years, I think it's one of their best. Shirley is a goddess; her voice is amazing not only on this CD but in anything she sings. Any Garbage fans MUST get this!!
B00884GR0W|5.0|Very Well Done.. Needs Multiplayer..<br /><br />The game has more content than minecraft and its priced way more in line with other Tablet Titles.
B00846REIS|1.0|I liked the book. The only thing I was annoyed with is the way Eva ran whenever something upset her. After they have sex the first time in the limo,and at the party
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a great app! Not only do I find it fun, but my grandson and I have had lots of fun teaming up on it.
B00138J234|5.0|This record brings back happy travel memories. Visited London (multi-times) &  Andalucia (Grenada, Sevilla, Gibraltar). They're fantastic and so is London Calling. Plus it's simply BPE (best punk ever).
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|Great movie, lots of action and adventure.  I love the dvd/blue ray combo.  If you like action movies and are a comic book lover, this movie is for you!
1593272782|4.0|My son is 8 and he loves Legos. He is very used to following the Lego instructions step by step. This book is different than lego instructions so he hasn't taken to it yet. For example, this book will give you ideas about how to orient a motor (with specific pieces) to make a creation do something. There is really no step by step building process as in Lego instructions. There are pictures of a creation, at various stages of being built and can sometimes be hard to see how something is put together.  As he grows out of the step by step style of building Lego creations, this book will be more useful.<br /><br />Also, you can ONLY recreate what is in the book if you have the same pieces.  Unfortunately, because we only have a relatively few number of Lego Technic pieces and motors, we cannot build most of the examples in this book. (We're in the process of buying more pieces.) For example, the motor we have is bigger than the one used throughout most of the book so we cannot build most of the books creations without buying the smaller motor. I think that as my sons collection of Technic grows, this book will become more useful.<br /><br />Overall I think this is a good book, but it requires a different way of thinking about how to build something. Also having most of the pieces and motors (that author uses in this book) is kind of a requirement so that you can build what you see. Hope this helps!
B000002H70|5.0|This is a classic!!  Every single track on this album is fantastic!  This is by far Cures best album!!  You will love it!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Good book, a little bit predictable for some though.<br />I really liked it -going to search more books by this author (:
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Fabulous album.  If you love Michael Jackson this is a must have album for you.  Add this one to your collection!!!
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I've watched this movie 2 times and another time with the director and actors commentary.  The attention to detail and the fun references to the first Boondock Saints movie, make it a must for Boondock fans, IMHO.  It isn't as brutally violent as the first movie, although violence permeates this one as well.  The addition of Julie Benz as the female FBI agent is brilliant! Her entrance in the killer red and black heels is a classic.  I bought this as a gift, but the person I bought it for was unenthusiastic based on the negative reviews, so I opened and watched it before sending it off.  Now, I have a dilema, because it is going to be impossible for me to let this copy go.<br />Enjoy!
B003Y8YXGC|5.0|I love this album!!  This takes me back to the 70&#34;s when I was a teenager.  If you are a John Lennon fan, you will love this.  It's classic John.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't wait to read the next book. Christian Grey loves Ana but he just doesn't know it yet. I loved reading this book it kept  me on my toes and left me breathless.
B00000J048|4.0|Gears were purchased for a special needs child to be mounted on an activity wall.  They are nice and bright and keep a child attending to task.  Would recommend
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Good storyline; terrible ending.  I felt cheated once I finished the book.  The author could have made the ending so much better.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|I used to only buy Swiss army knives, until I needed something with a good grip and pliers, this fit that need. The quality and feel is much better that knockoffs that you'll find at retail stores.  Gerber uses good quality metal and stuffs plenty of tools in a small package. Hinges and locks operate smoothly while blades have excellent sharpness.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I liked the easy read and story detail.  Only problem was the dad at the end but then it ended well.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Seriously one of the best movies ever.<br />Concept is mind blowing, Jim Carrey nails it, and you don't expect him to be remotely funny. He is lost in this character who id desperate and you can feel his heart, his sorrow, and his desire... and have we all not felt so hopeless with a fall out of love?<br />So relatable. Overall amazing. Great acting. Great concept. Great imagery.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I liked the continuing story but not so much the way it ended then found out I had to wait months to get the 3rd story.
B000067J1H|5.0|It's one of these movies that you never forget, you remember so many details, you feel like you fell into the world of Fight Club, and you have been possessed by the environment.<br />Acting? That's not acting... it's being.<br />Concept? That's not a concept... it's life.<br /><br />Really, it's a movie you watch and you are less of an idiot for watching it... it's an EXPERIENCE, not a movie.
B009YQJ322|5.0|I think Karl Urban think a great job as Dredd, and I loved Olivia as Anderson.  Lena Headey was a weak antagonist, but I guess that was how her character was written.  Overall, it's an action movie with a simple plot, but very enjoyable.  Only thing I didn't like was the slow motion.<br /><br />For all those people complaining it's not like the original, this is NOT a remake or sequel to the first movie.  The first movie was based off a comic, just like this one, and this is more true to the comics.<br /><br />Hopefully they will make a sequel if people buy and watch this movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|A lot of fun. The free game was short so I purchased the full version for 2.99. It was worth it. Great graphics &amp; puzzles.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This was a very gripping movie.  You can't compare the violence in this movie to that of an &#34;Action&#34; flick.  That kind of violence is almost comical in comparison.  This was real, believable and gut wrenching.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I just finished this game. It was fun for most of the game, but later levels began to feel tedious, forcing the same horizontal shifting in order to avoid obstacles. Upon completion, the only prize received is a message box stating that higher difficulty brings higher fun. Not even a cut-scene like I was expecting.<br /><br />I will likely set this game down now that I have completed it. I don't see any replay value.
B008JAGZDE|3.0|Of all the sequels to American Pie this one had the awesome feel of the first movie--GREAT TO HAVE IT BACK!!
B0013DAC6K|5.0|This is the one before Draw The Line. Wow! How his music speaks to me and I am so glad I listened to a co-workers reccomendation on this. BUY THIS!
B009VB97EY|2.0|The quality of the video was underwhelming. Overall acting was decently good. It seems to be a storyline that has been done before--take out previous theme and replace with hot male strippers. Minus the men it would've been bland.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Quite a few smaller interesting games all piled into one dl. Definitely worth the download.I would really advise this for trips.
B000M5NRLC|4.0|Just good ol' Jim Carrey. Totally enjoyed his approach to the movie. He can bring a script to life. All time favorite scene is him deciding whether to go to the party--what a human Grinch.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|this collection might the opposite for what been around lately: instead of an overpriced version with new cardboard material, this product offers the basic 8 movies in simple packaging at a very reasonable price.
B00138FAZ8|5.0|I found this music to be very relaxing. I would hear the music used in some tv commercials, and found out what song captivated me. The entire album is a wonderful tool to relieve stress.
B004NYQYNQ|4.0|I love Adele.  This c.d. is great.  My sister recommended it to me.  The pdf of the jacket sleeve is a nice touch.  It easily downloads to Amazon cloud.  However, pay attention to the details because it doesn't download to your computer automatically.  But works fine when you know how and where you want the music to go.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. had to play it all the way through. Very addictive. great graphics and great story.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Hey, have and have read all the books, got to have the whole series as well.  I know I will enjoy this series for a long time.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Very hard to get into due to French verbiage.  I gave it a good shot, but had to quit. Sorry,saw the movie recently, loved that.
B000002KCC|2.0|didn't realize so much of his early stuff was devoted to talking about, celebrating, using illegal drugs.  Some of the music i like, but not most of the lyrics.
B008I43DYU|4.0|I only use the standard part of the app but I love it. The numbers and functions are large and not only easily seen but very easy to hit the right keys. I only gave it 4 stars because I don't use the other functions.
B008ANFRGQ|4.0|great vai album here. it's no passion and warfare but still awesome. gravity storm is excellent. there is a smidge of filler as do all of his albums but its cool. thats why bcd's have a skip track function.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this movie delivers.  It is what it is - a movie about singing and finding your way in college.  It's put together well.  The actors/actresses do a great job and you'll laugh the whole way through.
B00000163G|2.0|I thought this was going to be the double cd.  Instead it was a limited edition and only contained one cd.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|I had to watch this during a college level class I was taking and it was a great movie to watch and analyze.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a fun game so far.  The graphics are very good,  and it seems easy to play.  It beats the old mahjong games that used to be on my computer.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I had the lite version installed, and thhis works perfectly. As someone else mentioned, you can just skip the fb logon.<br /><br />There are a ton of free video sources available, and you can use the ps3 slideshow app to even play a fancy slideshow of your phone pics.<br /><br />Basically, this turns your phone into a media server, much like built in Smartv features do, but without the ppv services.<br /><br />This is fantastic...don't let the negative reviews fool you into skipping this...try it for yourself.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|my little grand daughter downloaded this, She loves it, She loves playing the games. Since I have my kindle there has not been a day that we don't use it. Thank You.  Regina Borelli
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Having read the books,  and now owing the movies, can't wait for the final additon to my collection.  Evenn having seen it at the theatre, nothing like quite owning it.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book from the very beginning to the very end. Those Swedes can really spin a story. Tinges of Forrest Gump and every character wonderful. I have recommended to all my friends!
B0001WTWCO|5.0|The best movie ever!!!!! Love the actors, the story, the sights, the beginning, the end!!! Omg! Awesome! No matter how long it is!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Shades of The Help, but with the twist of being so embedded in our past history. Each character defined well. I literally cringed at some of the behavior toward the slaves, and the ignorance of civil rights. A very good story.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This app works great on my Droid X and my Razr Maxx. It does NOT spam your status bar, it does send push notifications about upcoming radio events. If you had looked in your settings you would see this can be turned off. As for recording, it works perfectly on these two phones, maybe an upgrade is in order for some of the complainers...  I got this as the FAOTD and have been pleased with the free offerings. Don't like the free app? Don't download it! I've passed on many of them. Don't dog an app because you lack the intelligence to change a setting...
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Very interesting cold war story...puts a face to the many unknowns. I decided to read Gorky Park after finishing Child44, and although good, not nearly as good as Child 44
B009DA74ES|5.0|I have bought all 5 seasons available and will buy 6 when its out! I highly recommend this to anyone with a broad sense of humor!!!
0765325950|1.0|So...you are going to make us wait for the ebook. That's really not fair. I have bought all the books in the series and they are very difficult for me to read due to the arthritis in my hands, sometimes I can't even hold them. Then 2 books ago I discovered ebooks, what a blessing. I immediately bought them all as ebooks and reread the series again, and now the wait begins again.....after all the years we have already waited.....greedy is what you are.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book very much. I like how it doesn't have any mushy teenage in love stuff. Full of action and I was really surprised by the ending.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|EACH EPISODE IS BETTER THAN THE LAST WITH LUCY LIU AND JONNY LEE MILLER GROWING MORE AND MORE INTO THE CHARACTERS OF HOLMES AND WATSON.
0765325950|5.0|I'll keep this short as not to give away any spoilers. This was the most perfect ending and the most fitting for the entire serious. Sanderson is the master of writing battle scenes and he doesn't fail us in this epic ending to an epic series. Thank you Brandon.
B000YABS8E|5.0|I have loved this movie since it first came out. I try to watch it a couple of times a year. It is timeless.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I heard one song fr this band so bought the album & love all the songs! Great buy in my opinion.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|This was the best series! My husband and I stayed up late into the night to watch it. We can hardly wait for the second season.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good read!! I will continue reading the series! I'll go see the movie too.<br />Reacher is an amazing character. Very resourceful.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Another movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. If you were able to get through the last movie (where there was a shred of a story), then you'll be fine with this one where there's less than a shred of a story.<br /><br />Loads of guns, explosions, and a general excessive, heavy-handed style that would make Michael Bay weep with a single tear of joy as he watches. The arterial spray is also quite over-done in this one. (I think they hired the Kill Bill SFX guy for the blood-work)... Tee hee.<br /><br />Oh and if you're still asking yourself, &#34;But in The Expendables 2, does Jason Statham pop out of the nose of a plane and fire a big gun like he's some sort of hood-ornament again? That was cool in the first movie...&#34; then do I have a freakin' surprise for you! He does! Multiple times! You think he's done with it... but then bam! again!<br /><br />Oh and there's a whole load of stars in this one... if &#34;stars&#34; means that they used to be famous and have a load of internet acquired cred. There's literally a scene where Chuck Norris &#34;Chuck Norriss' the whole town! (you'll see)&#34;<br /><br />Watch it!
1432794426|5.0|Karen Moriarty put her heart and soul into the writing and \\"Defending\\" of one of our most talented artist of our time.  She showed her passion for the life he lived.  M.L.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Really enjoyed this collection of episodes. The Big Bang Theory never fails to impress me. I believe this is the series where Raj falls in love with Siri as well.
B002361MLA|2.0|I was in San Francisco when I bought this book. I still haven't finished it. It's a little off the path for me. I will eventually finish it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Did not ever think I would like a story of (shipwreck) survival, and with a tiger at that! Sounded incredulous, but the plot is a page-turner, the language beautiful - check out some original similes and clever analogies used, and an ending that was indeed unexpected and though-provoking. Must read this before watching the movie!
B005IQZB14|4.0|Inspiring to our young women who seek independence and approval for same.  In the political climate today, this book is a breath of fresh air.  Overcoming personal loss and consequences of some bad choices drove this author to do what couldn't be done.  Good for her!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because it has a lot of fun opsyicle courses in it and a lot of fun looking trains
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I hate that I am finished.  I still want more tales from the trails.  A wonderfully brisk read and I am excited to try out some of his recipes'

B00A8ECU24|1.0|not very kid friendly did not like it to many notifications all the time  to many things to buy with real money not good
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love this game. It is quite fun. It just suffers from the puzzle game problem of getting boring and repetitive.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app. this app is asome. I want you to play it.<br />you should play it. asome game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved this story!!  Very touching, an emotional roller coaster.<br />A beautiful tragic love story, that somehow wouldn't have been as beautiful without the tragedy.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was very good book who ever reads this should get this and read this because it is vary funny. And when I am sad I read this book and I'm better
B005KDWUFA|5.0|My friend and I drove 8 hours to DC to actually see and hear these beautiful men in concert. It was more exciting than I expected; more than see the Beatles in Indianapolis, of course I'm older now, but the teenager came out at their concert!!!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|THIS GAME IS REALLY AWESOME BECAUSE ILL NEVER EVER DELETE IT AND THE MULTIPLAYER FEATURES ARE AWESOME!!! and that's why modern combat 4 rocks
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A book that grabs you and pulls you in. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. Surprises all along the way.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I like the game but me and my friend cannot connect. The WiFi is fine but we both have kindle fires and it still will not even detect each other's. It's<br /> Mark I my me really mad. Does anyone know what to do? We r both in the same house! Help me!
B000NA1OXY|5.0|I like Avril Lavigne and this is a good CD.  Worth listening to and worth buying. I'd definitely recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|5 stars definitely! This game is very fun (and addictive, so beware) in my opinion, I think that this game is was way more fun than temple run, why are you still reading this? GET IT NOW, IT'S FREE!!!!!
0375826726|5.0|I purchased this book for my teen-aged Godson, who loved it. He read it in one night so that's the best review it can get from him.  Given that, I recommend it for that age group.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I bought 2 99 cent apps because I wanted a camcorder. At first it was working just fine and now every time I try to record it says &quot;camera has stop working&quot;
B007SGM084|3.0|I purchased this trilogy because it was the talk everywhere I went. I hadn't heard anything about it and then it hit me like a wave.  Honestly, I don't know what the excitement is all about.  The actual storyline was mediocre and the dominant/submissive sex got to be boring, to me, really quickly,  Maybe some women just have boring love lives.  Anyway, I didn't see what all the hype was about but then, I'm not submissive and wouldn't want to dominate my man.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I read one book by John Green and I loved it so I read all the other books he has written. An Abundance of Katherines along with all of his other books are amazing! His charactersm are witty, fun and original. It is a book you pick up and can't stop reading.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|Everyone likes the music of John Mayer and this is his best to date.  Should not be missed.  I'd highly recommend it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|good but there are no caves. also, what happened to changing render distances.? plus you should be able to change out of the crafting thing. I'm used to pc.
1416914293|4.0|This is a book that is apparently currently popular among teens as it was requested for a gift by one.  I don't know what it is about, however when I asked if he liked it, he assured me that it was good.  Given that, I recommend this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Tears and laughter throughout the book.  Young love at its best!  Not your usual &#34;cancer&#34; book, but very real to the end.
1595141979|5.0|I gave this book to my teenaged Godson and he loved it.  Read it in one night, if that tells you anything.  So, for that age group, I would recommend it.
1594203334|5.0|I was recommended to read this by the director of a French language immersion school we are considering for our daughter.  Although at times the author seems to live in a fantasy world being a New Yorker living in Paris I could totally identify with her as a mom.  I laughed out loud quite frequently and wish I had read it sooner.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|An enjoyable read, just not pulling me in like the majority of the earlier Clancy novels.  Perhaps the implausibility of such a father son combination
B007MDB548|5.0|Sometimes I resist watching &#34;made for girls&#34; Disney movies for fear of my daughter turning into an empty headed &#34;fluff&#34; monster.  This story about friendship is eye catching and fun for kids but filled with subtle learning opportunities.  My daughter was very happy to tell her friends that frost protects plants from deeper freezes and somehow managed to learn that water freezes into snow and frost and snow and ice melt to water.  Of course now she wants a Periwinkle dress and the usual assortment of tie in merchandise.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great grahpics, a good hidden object game. Story line kind of dark but interesting.  So far I love it.  Easy to use hint button. Game difficult just enough to be challenging.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|On the surface you might think &#34;how can I relate to a story about a couple of guys who decide selling meth is the way forward?&#34; I know I did.  Then I ended up finding a little too much to identify with!
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Played great, too much horror for my taste but the futuristic technology and the space or that relating to the universe was very good.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|how can't you love a nexus device.  Updates are fast the phone is smooth and the features are just incredible
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I know this is a kids game, however strategy is involved and I missed the boat on this one. I get frustrated.
B004Y042N8|5.0|I'am glade I choose this puzzle game, i find it very challenging.  Some are easy and some are hard which make you want to find the solution.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game and play it a lot. I like the help features. What else can I say I like this game.
B009H442DG|5.0|GREATEST COUPLE EVER for movies and music! They are great together. We really enjoyed the selection of songs too! Thank you!
B000002IG4|5.0|The quality of the music gives manyh hours of enjoyment.  Downloading was easy.  I would recommend this product to others.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|We made a great choice in this music. We love the selection of songs, the music, his voice, CHRISTMAS is in the air! Thank you!
B000002MY3|5.0|The quality of the music gives manyh hours of enjoyment.  Downloading was easy.  I would recommend this product to others.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Second book in the trilogy.  It was exciting and a page turner.  The series is a page turner.  Love it.
B00AA0YEXE|5.0|It was so great to listen to an album of new music from Phillip.  I've been a fan since his first song on American Idol, and this album does not disappoint. I would recommend it to any music lover.
B001NZ3DY6|5.0|Shania has a sound all her own.  It's so peppy.  It gets your heart pumping and feet moving.  Love it.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|not sure but Big Bang will always deliver the goods!  And so will Walowitz:)  You can't help but want to be their friend and have their intelligence for that matter!  The show's humor will not disappoint!  Also, when will Kuthropalie ever talk to a girl without drinking?!  Keep watching....and hoping!
B001KWR3PM|5.0|Eric is one of a kind.  His music is so mellow.  I enjoy all of his songs.  Love this album
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Seeing them live is PHENOMENAL!  They have such a charasmatic, dance like you don't care who sees you kind of energy.  I love these guys and this album makes me feel like I did when I saw them live.  Such talented guys and the singer is a mix between (the voice like) Al Green and (the soul and energy of) James Brown.  Buy this album if you like something different and want some new music.  I saw these guys open for Joss Stone and it was one of the best concerts I've ever been to.
B00138CXZI|5.0|Greatest Hits, how could you choose.  She has so many hits and a sound all her own.  I love it.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this show when I used to avoid this show like the plague!  I looooove this show and can say I laugh my head off watching it.  But ya gotta start from the beginning and you'll want to be a nerd after watching this first season!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Lots of twists and turns in this series.  It's a great story, couldn't put it down.  Many sleepless night reading.  Love it.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I'm a film fanatic and I love watching Christmas movies....but  I don't like to add any contemporary movies to my list of favorites but ELF definitely is.  I love this movie and I'm so happy to have a copy because now I can watch it all year round to give me that &#34;Santa's coming!!!!!!!!!!!!&#34;  feeling:)
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|House at The End of The Street  is kind of a quirky flick.  For the most part, there's no supernatural stuff; just a few whacked out people.  It falls apart about 2/3 the way through though and the remaining time has you wondering why they took it this way to close it out.  Not too bad and if it's a cheap rental I'd recommend it. If full price; wait until it rolls over to Amazon Prime for free.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I just love Sheldon's character so much-a genius who is socially awkward yet emotionally retarded.  He jokes yet doesn't know it's funny.  He makes this show what it is today in alot of ways!  All these guys add a little something and of course Penny adds the lay person's point of view but gotta love her quick wit and her craziness!  This show is a classic in my book!
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Well, I enjoyed it quite a lot. There are some interesting caracters in it and Follett writing is very pleasant as far as I can get not beeing English my native language.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I've loved every season so far but this one starts of hilarious and keeps going til you're crying with laughter- it's that FUNNY!  From the first episode of this season it's just a little different than other seasons and it's possibly my favorite season because the hilarity continues from episode to episode...it's not just building up.  I don't know but I hope these writers keep this up:)  but season 6 has been GREAT so far as well.  Love me some BBT anytime!!!!!!!
B000BB1MI2|5.0|this movie came in fast and was in mint condition..this remake is so funny i luved it..some remakes u think are gona suck and yet this one was almost as good as the first
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I love all these guys and you just can't go wrong!  If you're in a bad mood, just pop one of these discs in for to get you in a better mood.  Life just wouldn't be the same without some bad, nerd behavior:)
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|But the kids did not..maybe more enjoyable for an adult in all its weirdness. Also a little slow. Where have you been Winona?!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The main characters were very unbelievable with all their perfections (could she really believe she wasn't beautiful all the way through college?) and after the story got into his (so physically beautiful and mega rich and on and on with his money) hangup, I decided I didn't want to read whatever information about dominance and submission would be in my mind.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|I saw Papa Roach in concert and I have been hooked since. This is a great album. Great price also.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book from start to finish! The book made you feel like you were in the arena with them fighting for survival.
B000062TU1|5.0|Typical Harry Potter fantasy movie...bought it as a gift for a lover of these movies. She liked it...would have preferred the regular edition, but couldn't go back to it when browsing. Full screen worked well, too.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|I downloaded this one for my wife - we read different genres - but she said she loved it and didn't want to put it down because she always wanted to know what happened next!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|This box set was a Christmas present for my daughter and son in law. My husband and I received the response we hoped, speechless and excited. This is the perfect gift to add to their music collection and music studio.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|he movie kept buffering, as do many of the movies/shows that I $$ from amazon.com.  I like ordering ITEMS from Amazon, but I don't love their streaming.
B00A757EFW|1.0|the old comadore 64 game was much better, to hard to get out if you want to stop. dont do it.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Anyone who would write a book they are ashamed for their father to read is not for me.<br /><br />Actually I read the first chapter, and find it a real turn off.<br /><br />Sorry, not my style. I didn't like what was implied in the title alone. However, it was a freebie.<br /><br />My instincts proved right. A waste of time.<br /><br />Another disappointment be cause of misleading reviews.
B008220C38|3.0|Romantic by imagery, not by actors' performances. I do not agree that Keira Knightley performed her role well. Her portrayal of Karenina would better suit a childless, free-spirited woman comfortable with her sexuality, rather than a woman who is married, has a child, has had no prior extramarital experiences, is still young, for who an affair is an exciting yet initially frightening territory, especially while living in a 19th-century Russia. Outside of the costumes, this movie feels as un-Russian as one could imagine. Moreover, one of the most important characters of the novel, Levin, has been reduced to a half-empty caricature.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Plex is absolutely the best media server/client solution. It streams everything with no issues, organizes your media, automatically downloads metadata including synopses and images. You can add streaming videos from other sites like YouTube and watch them on plex. I use it on all my android devices and my roku as well as my kindle fire. Highly recommended.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|I never played FF before. At first sight I was shocked about the fact that I just paid 15 bucks for such antique graphics. They are a bit out of fashion, but soon I started to value the depth of the story and how well the original game was crafted. A lot of attention to detail. Like when your characters express moods by nodding etc. Also game is really long. You usually don't find this as app. I am now well over 24h playing time and no end in sight.    The kindle port works really well in all respects of the game. Steering with finger on the screen is fine. Only saving is a bit awkward at first, but you'll get used to it. You can exit the game at any time and it will autosave.    I believe this is a re-release or re-make of the Nintendo DS version from 2006 which in turn was a re-make of the game originally released in Japan on Japan on April 27, 1990 (source: [...]).
B008K5T5AI|5.0|Another sublime Banks novel, which shows that Heaven is just a few words away, only if you want it. And ships can shows great restraint, when they know they can kill you easy.
B00785P2QC|3.0|great fun game to pass the time took a while to get used to it but great game.<br />downside can get boring
B000FCKC4C|2.0|I kept reading this thing on the slim hope that it could say something, anything, to justify it's immense popularity. It never did and remains in my mind a monument to the ineffectual thinking and the daydreaming of most homosapiens
B004H4XLR4|4.0|We've bought this for our 3-year old son.<br />It is quiet big and has a space for two diecast cars inside.<br />Though the doors open not so easy they should for children
B003K16P3M|5.0|Make believe worlds, magical powers, love,and adventure. It just doesn't get any better than this. Graceling is a great read for all ages.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Really good sci-fi movie.  Don't blink or you will lose it... If you have to have everything explained to you and can't figure stuff out for yourself you probably won't get this movie. Don't think about the premise too much or you'll ruin it for yourself. Just sit back and enjoy.  The best acting in the whole thing is the little kid, I have to wonder how they got that performance out of him.  I'm gaining an appreciation for JGL and will probably watch him in more movies, the association was a good one.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I think Sanderson is among the most interesting writers of today. This is a smaller work than some of his other books but is an excellent entertaining story.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|lovely options and great qualities for you to use when you need it the most on travel or at home.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was hooked from the first chapter, just kept getting better.  Hated to see it end I plan on reading Gillian Flynn's other book.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a good book. The characters, Sky & Holder were great.  While reading about their lives, the author took you on quite a few turns in the story.  Which is a good thing.  I thought that Karen was actually Sky's mom, but it turned out differently, she was Sky's aunt.  Good read.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|I'm not even surprised anymore. The king of space opera has struck again. Great book, i'd love another A.I. centered book, but im not going to complain about whatever he gives us.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting storyline that keeps you guessing (I guessed wrong at every turn!). Complex characterizations and twists and turns. I looked forward to picking it up every day. I gave it four stars because I was not satisfied with the ending...
B005AKFXZW|5.0|Though the ending could have been better, I loved the novel. If you are the type who like Harry Potter novels then you will definitely love this book. There is so much magic and love involved which will glue us to the novel.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Having had a brother that was a quad, I so hoped this book would have had a different anything.  With love a person can learn to live a different life but still rewarding.  This book was beautifully written.  Loved it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is an amazing story, sky and holder are wise beyond years and I was right there through each emotion!!!! A must read!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Isn't there supposed t be three books in a trilogy?  Where is book Three? No mention of a future publication date.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Is usually accurate i use this before i go fishing to make sure it would be a good day. I like how it shows wind speed and direction
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Love the movie. It was packaged to protect and received per quoted delivery. Can't wait to watch it again. Last time I seen this movie was in a movie theater.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is amazingly addictive! At first, after only a few runs, I thought \\"This is too hard. I'm never going to accomplish even the first objective.\\" But, I quickly got the hang of it and was completing objectives left and right. After an hour of play, I still find myself saying \\"Oh, just one more run.\\" I play on a Kindle Fire and have had no issues. Simple and fun! Thanks for a great app.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|Love the movies. It was packaged to protect and received per quoted delivery. Can't wait to watch them again. Last time I seen these movies was in a movie theater. Great collection to have.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book took you into British culture and living that no other has done The characters was very different  from one I m used to in other books.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Wonderful book with lots of twists and turns. I thought I had it figured out once or twice only to find the story going off in a different direction.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was one of the most interesting books I have read in a long time. The change in the story line was great.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|never disappointed when i read a nicholas sparks book  love the way he writes and safe haven was amazing. you are drawn in right away, able to identify with the characters, and the ending was a shocker loved it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Could not put this book down for anything!!!!  Great book that captures you from the first page to the last.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Does exactly what it's supposed to do.<br />Big display is very helpful.<br />I would recommend this calculator to anyone looking for an easy to use calculator.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|As always Angry birds is a fun game to play whether on the computer, tablet or smart phone.  I have gotten many hours of enjoyment out of this already.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I'm a huge video mahjong player and have several different mahjong games on my tablet - and I put this one on my phone, too. I really enjoy this version - lots of challenge options.
B006X50OPW|5.0|Great book. It just shows that beating the market can be done by hard work and real focus. A classic.
B004HD61KE|1.0|Good story but too much of the Mormon stuff. Don't need too much of a religious background in my story.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is one of the best games ever and I love it because it never stops.You get to buy different people
B005COO1X6|5.0|Excellent! I loved it!<br />Very good story and kind of wished it was a tad bit longer but loved it.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Thoroughly recommended read - a real page turner and now I know what everyone's been talking about! As usual, the book is much better than the movie!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and I could see how one day, in the far future something of this nature could actually happen. The world is a vast mystery.
1451613512|5.0|Well documented book.<br />Outline the facts that let us understand why so many people around the world hate us, and why the gap between poors and rich keeps being bigger and bigger and why our society exhibits an enormous level of violence.
B003QSMC18|5.0|Recently, my two daughters, ages 6 and 10, both got a cold. My oldest daughter, the ten year old, has a love for disney, so I rented this on her laptop. Her sister came in and watched with her and they really enjoyed it. It was the ten year old's idea to rent this movie, and she LOVED it. She watched it three times!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I really enjoyed this drama.  It reminds me of the writing of Jane Austin and other English writers.  The scenery is beautiful.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie. Judi Dentch is wonderful and has a great chemistry<br />with Maggie Smith who is always a scene stealer. A wonderful movie for the<br />whole family.
B002K0WBY6|5.0|This is a great movie! Love, Love, Love it!<br />I don't know what else to say.....great movie.  I recommend it.
B00000DHR0|5.0|but it's especially great around the Christmas holidays. What an incredible voice! This is Celine Dion at her absolute finest.
B008KH3XHW|3.0|I purchased this tripod because it said that it fits the Samsung Galaxy S3.  While I was able to cram my phone into it with some difficulty, it's pretty clear that the S3 is slightly larger than this tripod was designed to handle.  The spring broke after the 2nd use so it no longer &#34;squeezes&#34; down. It still works without the spring (sort of).  In general, it feels every bit as flimsy and cheap as you'd expect a $4 tripod to feel.  Don't expect to get more than you paid for - it's functional, you can use it to keep your phone still, but I wouldn't recommend this for anything serious.  It currently works very well as a stand for my phone, when I am watching Netflix or browsing the news while eating.
B009XTF8KQ|3.0|Although I wasn't looking for a documentary I wanted a movie that was a little closer to the truth. This box has a long history and it was passed around through too many different hands. Whether or not the claims are actually true I wanted to see an interpretation of them. Instead I saw another variation of The Exorcist, a Haunting in Connecticut, and the exorcism of Emily Rose. The movie itself was pretty good, what is the routine cookie cutter Horror Story where is child gets possessed and the parents come to rescue.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have played Dragonvale for over a year on my iPhone, now I can get it on my Fire. Yeah!!!
B0051QO4QY|5.0|My daughter is a huge lady gg fan and loved this album. She loves to listen to it all the time
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a great series. I love the convenience of being able to watch an episode whenever I want to and not have to be on the shows schedule. The acting is terrific, the writing is great and Amazon Instant Video is the best. Keep up the great work Amazon.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|What can I say it's Twitter it is what it is and that's awesome as far as I'm concerned 5 stars.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love this series.  The acting is terrific and the story line and writing are superb. It's great to go out to the movies once in a while but when you can't get to a movie, you can enjoy movies or TV with Amazon Prime Video.. Great service, great people, all the newest movies and DVDS, what more could we ask for?
B000062V9C|1.0|got the movie and put it in a dvd player and a computer and it would not work now i have to try and return it
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|So it doesn't come with the factory packaging, but the card is genuine and works as one would expect the generally pricey but tough gear from Olympus to. I'm happy with it, and saved some money to boot.
B006X5L6VS|3.0|Over the years I have used many digital star charts.  This one is a bit difficult to master since I cannot easily set the location from which the sky is to be viewed, despite the instructions offered.
0765325950|5.0|The long awaited last book is everything I hoped for. I can't out it down...Brandon is a great writer & I'm sure Robert would be very happy with the outcome.
B004GYY714|2.0|This application implies that one can tune in radio at will.  The reality is far from what I found when launching the software.
B004RLPTT0|2.0|You would be better off by the songs from the artist directly versus getting this sound track. Or better yet watch youtude videos with other tracks put to the movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. It's very romantic in a way. And it's a must read! Me and my best friend fell in love(:
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|I have been an on again off again zombie fan. I think playing the Left 4 Dead computer games have really help made me a zombie fan. The walking dead series on TV and comic books and continued to strengthen my interest in this genre.<br /><br />About the series:<br /><br />First view episodes does a great job of pulling you in, after that some people complain the plot and story goes nowhere. I disagree because I enjoy the character development and silly distractions the survivors go through when surrounded by the walking dead.<br /><br />If you are new to the genre this worth your time and money to watch ALL seasons of this show. Also I would recommend Zombieland as well! :)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought this book as perfect. I fell in love with this book. I love everything about it. I love Sam, I love Patrick... and I fell in love with Charlie. By far, the best book I've ever read. I'm just sad it's over. Like I said...perfect. In every way possible.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Best book I have read in my life!OMG! This book is amazing. There's so much action with tons of romance too.
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|After a series of flops, Frankenweenie is Tim Burton's best film in recent years. Personally, I am not as big a fan of Burton's live action films as others are but I have always loved his stop motion animated films. Burton is a master at this genre. The film's storyline of course mimics Frankenstein with a few twists. After losing his dog to a car accident, a boy figures out from his science teacher how to bring it back to life. Soon, the other kids at school force the boy to show them how to revive their pets for the upcoming science fair. Mayhem ensues. The craft of the stop motion figures is simply amazing and all the characters are full of life. The story, for this kind of a film, also contains meditative moments about life and death and also social commentary on the anti-science hysteria in the US. The film can be enjoyed by adults as much as kids. Some say the film is too dark for kids but it's nothing compared to other films and TV shows these days and the film has lots of soul and love to counter the darkness.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Disney has made quite a few gems over the past few decades but they are surrounded by a lot of junk that seemed to be produced to just make a kids movie because they could. Mulan is a traditional story for modern girls and is highly entertaining.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|I will fully admit upfront that I am probably not Pitch Perfect's (2011) intended audience and probably would never have rented this film had there not been as much buzz about it as there has been. With that out of the way, I found that \\"Pitch Perfect\\" had a very unique and interesting story idea but that it wasn't as well executed as it could have been. I applaud the writer(s) and director for trying something different with the coming-of-age romantic comedy genre. The plot concerns a group of girls that are trying to win the nationwide college A cappella competition from their rivals, an all male group that has won the previous years. The singing sections are interesting and give the film its own unique style. However, I found that the intermediary stages were not that great. Most of the characters in the movie are either one-dimensional or forgettable. The leader of the girls group, for example, is so singularly overbearing that the scenes where she fights with the group become quickly repetitive and boring. I did not find the Australian fat girl that funny. I laughed at the introduction of the roommates to the lead characters but then they are never developed effectively. The key to this kind of film is quirky characters that will deliver good punch lines or be the brunt of a joke (see Rushmore, for example). Without developed characters, the non-musical scenes just seemed like filler. I also think the material was more appropriate for a high school setting. It's hard to imagine this much enthusiasm for A Cappella amongst freshmen college students. That being said, it's still worth a rent. I just don't think it deserves the extreme hype it is getting.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Used this for adult book club where we brought our kids - very successful! John Green's books are easily read and make you think.
B00AQ4U6P4|4.0|This movie was pretty good.  A group of us watched this and everyone liked it.  We had read some reviews prior to watching it that were not all that good, so we were a bit hesitant about purchasing this movie.  However, we are really glad we gave it a chance because it deserves better reviews than it got!  The movie had mystery and suspense.  The acting was pretty good.  We all talked about the movie afterwards because it really had some surprises and twists that we enjoyed discussing. We would recommend this movie.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|The Battery HD Pro tells exactly how much power you have left for whatever you want to do on your Kindle Fire HD. When I first got the Kindle I couldn't interpret the battery icon, so I was very interested in this app. It's worth every penny of the $2.00 it cost.  I'd give it 6 stars if that were possible.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So good. Can't wait to read the next one. If I had a Christian of my own I'd never let him go!!

B007FEFLTO|5.0|In Winter of the World Ken Follet brings the historical events surrounding the second world war to life by following the families he introduced in part one of this trilogy.  I have been a Follet fan since I first read Pillars of the Earth and this latest book exceeded my high expectations.  I will be anxiously awaiting the final book.
B00APOSIEQ|5.0|I learned HTML back in the 1990s, and I'm sorry to say I didn't really keep up with it.  I was familiar with CSS, but had no idea what the possibilities were!  I'm extremely comfortable with typography and page layout, and had always been frustrated trying to mimic print with HTML and tables.  It just didn't work, and it never looked like the professional sites I admired.<br /><br />I bought this as a Kindle version for my iPad because I couldn't wait to get started.  The other versions of this book got good reviews, so I decided to take a chance.  Although I have an iPad, I've NEVER used it for reading, and the only technical book on Sketchup I'd bought on it was a huge disappointment.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that this is a GREAT book, and a great way to learn CSS.  The instructions are clear, the tutorials really reinforce what the reader is learning.  The examples do what they are supposed to, and I have a COMPLETE understanding of the concepts I've covered so far.  I went into this with a basic understanding of *old* HTML, and a really limited view of CSS's capabilities and a completely backwards understanding of how to code with it.  I had also tried learning CSS from some good tutorials on YouTube, but they weren't comprehensive.  I gave in and bought several books.  But while I'm waiting for the others to be delivered, I've already learned most of what I need from this book.<br /><br />I always tend to buy technical books, then skim the pages to find what I need, and never actually read the book.  I'm reading this one because I'm comfortable with the Kindle format...I can adjust the fonts larger, change the columns and background.  The overall experience of having this in electronic form is great.  I can even \\"highlight\\" lines, and see what other readers have highlighted as well.<br /><br />Definitely 5 stars.  If you're like me, and let your technical knowledge slip because the new stuff was intimidating, THIS is the book for you.  I feel like I can confidently understand and write code with CSS.idently understand and write code with CSS.

1451695195|2.0|You know how most guys can't describe things very well?  Like maybe there's a new person at work and you ask them what they look like.  They say something like, \\"Uh, I dunno, I guess he had glasses.\\"  Or something of similar ilk.  What I really want to know is how tall is he, how old is he, what color is his hair, etc.  You get my drift here.<br /><br />That's how this book was for me.  A guy's view.  It was really short on any details of Heaven.  And that is particularly why I would want to read a book like this.  Show me the money!  Tell me what the actual journey was like in a highly descriptive way.  This book did NOT deliver.  At all.<br /><br />Most of it was a story of the author's family and how things were going on earth.  I mean, that's fine and all, but I already know how things are on earth.  He goes on repeatedly how it was just so amazing that he got the disease he got and came out of it.  Once again, that's very nice and I'm glad for him and his family, but this is not why I wanted to read the book.<br /><br />The \\"Heaven\\" parts consisted mainly of a place that was like being in mud, a better place where you could see angel like entities (though they were described very briefly), and \\"The Core\\", which is supposed to be where God is, or something.  He doesn't describe that at all.<br /><br />This book is a waste of money unless you simply want a nice story of a scientist guy who overcame a grave illness, and you want to know lots about his family.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|nice even mix of calm and a little race competition building buying breeding and cross breeding. game is pretty okay. could be played by most people.

0385536828|1.0|This book starts out interesting with Serena, a British girl who is sort of floundering through school and love life - and then suddenly it feels like a text book about UK politics - which I totally didn't understand or have any interest in!  So I have to admit I gave up at page 104 chapter 9...I am really not sure where the story was going and I'm not curious enough to slog through and find out! I took this book from the library so I am very glad I didn't purchase it!  If you are passionate about UK politics and Cold War era scenarios you might like it.  If you are just looking for a good read, this probably won't be your cup of tea!
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|I'll say right now that despite giving the game 3/5 stars, I do really like this and recommend those interested to try it. There's just some glaring problems that knock my rating down.<br /><br />I've been playing this for 1-2 weeks now on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" and I feel I have a fairly good feel for the game. I know this game is a spin-off from the Order & Chaos MMO, but I've never played it and there's only minimal story involved so I'm comfortable saying you won't miss much, except maybe a quick off-hand reference or two. It's standard fantasy fluff anyway.<br /><br />GENRE OVERVIEW:<br /><br />Now if you're familiar with the PC gaming MOBA / DOTA-clone genre, which includes (of course) Defense of the Ancients 1&2, League of Legends, Heroes of Newerth or Awesomenauts (among others), you know what you're getting into. If you're not familiar with those, you have a team with 3-5 members each controlling a hero and you fight an opposing team on generally three lanes of traffic which connect each others' bases. You want to destroy their base, but there's powerful towers in the way that attack you which you must destroy first. There's also small waves of \\"creeps\\" or \\"minions\\" that are on your side which are computer controlled, and they blindingly throw themselves at the towers. You kill enemy creeps and heroes to gain gold and experience, the former of which you spend in an item shop to get special items that power you up. You can get whatever you like but there are recommended items, and you may need several smaller items to combine to get a nice powerful item.<br /><br />If you die you lose some gold and everyone on the other team gets some gold and experience. Gain enough experience and you level up, and get new special abilities. In these types of games, try really hard not to die.<br /><br />LET'S GET STARTED:<br /><br />With that out of the way, I'll come right out and say that Heroes of Order & Chaos is nearly a straight-up League of Legends copy. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing. I don't play it often myself, preferring DOTA 2, but as far as I know there's no other MOBA game available for mobile let alone versions of DOTA or LoL, and amazingly enough Gameloft has actually done a REALLY good job bringing the genre to mobile devices. For the most part.  More below.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />Controls / Gameplay: I was expecting to fight with them every step of the way but I was pleasantly surprised. They aren't (and can't) be as complicated as a PC MOBA, but they work well enough. You can either control your hero via a directional pad in the bottom left, or tap to send them somewhere. You can tap to select a target, or hit a button in the bottom right to switch through the closest enemies. And in the bottom right there's an attack button which lets you start auto-attacking.  Also most of the features of LoL are here, including grass to hide in, teleporting back to vase, and talents and spells to set up out of battle.<br /><br />Graphics: The game looks pretty nice for what it's trying to do, and I've rarely had slowdown on my Fire HD 8.9\\". Some of the spell effects are quite nice. The main slowdown I've had is actually in the out of match shop, where it lets you spin a slot-machine type of thing to get items.<br /><br />Shop: Like LoL there's a rotation of different playable heroes every week and if you find one you really like you'll have to buy him. Thankfully everything except cosmetic skins and experience / currency boosters can be bought with in-game currency which you gain by playing (and there's a small among you can earn by completely daily challenges). It may take you a TON of matches, but you can buy any hero by playing and you're likely to find one among the rotation you like. One of my favorite heroes I actually got through the daily slot-machine: The Gambler.<br /><br />To buy the gems to get a hero you'll be spending generally between $9.95-$15.92. Some are cheaper and some are more expensive.I really don't mind this. It's a well made game they're letting you play for free, so if you like the game and find a favorite I don't see the harm in shelling out 10 bucks.<br /><br />You can get three of the cheapest boosters for the smallest amount of money you can spend, $1.99 (100 gems). They each last for one match.<br /><br />Given the whole My Little Pony app cashshop debacle, I had very little confidence Gameloft could make a decent cash shop system, but I'm pleased with what they've done here.<br /><br />Length: They haven't changed the traditional MOBA formula around too much, so expect your matches to be around the same length as their PC counterparts.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />Length: They haven't changed the traditional MOBA formula around too much, so expect your matches to be around the same length as their PC counterparts.<br /><br />Controls \ Gameplay: Although I said I was pleasantly surprised by the controls, there's still issues and particularly with targeting. Sometimes the \\"switch to closest target\\" button doesn't register the REAL closest target, and on at least three occasions an enemy hero managed to teleport away simply because I couldn't target them properly. That was infuriating. This may be reduced by focusing on controlling the game through tapping however, as I tend to use a combination of tapping and the virtual-stick / pad.<br /><br />Also sometimes when you're running away via stick and you tap or (god forbid) accidently DRAG, you can either make your hero run towards where you tapped or the camera will decide to run off in a random direction, making you either lift from the stick and push it in that direction again, or open the map to refocus. Both can get you killed. Another note about the stick, the range in the bottom left you can press and drag to walk is a little nebulous, and sometimes I tried to drag the camera around and accidently started controlling my hero. That's mostly solved with experience though.<br /><br />Graphics: The only complaint I have about the graphics is the same complaint I have with LoL. Too many heroes and creeps around, and the spells start flying, you can quickly lose yourself in the clusterf*** of color that results. Add in the targeting difficulties of singling out one target via button or tapping in that mess, and I think you can see my annoyance. It's not a huge issue though. ...Although I just had a thought; you can expend a little menu to see the health of your and the enemy teams, and you may be able to target by clicking on a portrait. EDIT: Yep, you can target like that. It's annoying to have that menu out all the time, but you can keep it closed unless you're in a big fight.<br /><br />Communication: It's easy enough to plop down \\"!\\" notices on the map, and there's a quick message system for yelling out missing, but being on mobile devices means that it's difficult to type out messages since it completely removes you from the action for a few seconds. There's no big strategies involved. There's supposed to be a voice communication system, but I've never gotten it to work or seen the option outside the Options Menu.<br /><br />Balance: This is often complained about in EVERY game this genre has but in my first match ever, using a hero I had never even seen before, managed to get 18/3 K/D. That's not bragging, that simply shouldn't happen. I've been on the opposite end of that too. Not too too often though. Whether these are true balance issues or flukes, I'm honestly not the best to say, but I thought I'd list it here.<br /><br />THE UGLY:<br /><br />Now the REAL problem with this game. All the above would only knock my rating down to 4 stars, given how much fun and how faithful to the genre this game (\\"HOC\\") is.<br /><br />Matchmaking: So bad. Just so, so bad. Let me explain. You can play 3v3 or 5v5 Player vs Player, cooperatively, or solo. Solo has you on a team with computer teammates fighting computer controlled enemies. Cooperatively lets you form a human team against computer controlled heroes. And the AI is horrible and does nothing to prepare you for human players. Player vs Player is just how it sounds, two teams of human players.<br /><br />*I've never actually played 5v5 PvP.* I don't know if it's due to terrible servers, or low player numbers (does the Kindle Tablet edition have its own separate pool of players? I don't know), but each time I've tried to connect to the 5v5 mode I've had to wait upwards of 40 minutes in a queue. That's insane. Especially for a mobile game. To make matters worse, usually past that mark I would lose my connection to gameloft or something else would happen, and my position in the queue would be reset. And to make matters *even worse,* on the Kindle Fire HD you cannot have the game put into the background, meaning you can't do anything else but browse the shop while you wait. I contacted Amazon about putting apps into the background, but they've told me flat-out it's not possible. Maybe a 3rd party app can enable this somehow.<br /><br />3v3 is a little better, generally being around 20 minutes, but again, you cannot do anything else on your device while you wait.<br /><br />Improper closing: Despite what I just wrote above, you can actually get the game to go into the background. Not to let you wait on the matchmaking queue, but because there's instances it doesn't shutdown properly. There's some points in the game, like if you're starting a tutorial or trying to start the game while offline, it simply won't let you quit. Hitting the back button brings up a message \\"You cannot go back at this time\\" or similar, which means you have to hit the home button and this keeps the app running in the background. Accidently started the app when offline is a pain because of this. I hope you have a task manager because this can slow your device to a crawl.<br /><br />Offline mode: There really isn't one. Well, you can fake it. Since there's a solo mode I thought it'd be really nice to play HOC while I don't have a connection, just for a quick bit of fun. But like I said above, if you're offline and you start the app you won't get far. There is a way around this however. If you're online and connected to Gameloft and then put your device into sleep, when you wake it back up (say, when you leave your wifi connection range) you should be at the main menu still. At that point you can start up a solo game no problem. Normally you get a tiny amount of experience and in-game currency for playing solo, but it warns you that you cannot get rewards while not connected. Big deal, I just wanted to play.<br /><br />I contacted Gameloft about the offline mode seeing what they could do about putting the game in the background from their side, but they haven't responded to me in a week.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />HOC really is fun. There's some drawbacks to the controls, but given you're trying to play a MOBA on a mobile device I'd say that comes with the territory. Overall it's very well done. The big downfall is the matchmaking problems. A MOBA lives and dies by its community. It's (almost) an entirely online genre and that's where the real fun comes from. Take that away and it's still fun, but it's a shadow of what it could be.<br /><br />Despite the 3 stars, and the ugly stuff I mentioned, I'm still having fun with it and I recommend you give it a try.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a must read to understand the series of G of T. Would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the series.
B001GPTC1Q|3.0|It was interesting, better than I thought it would be; the best scene was King Kong fighting the dinosaurs. Frank Black's performance was horrible, though-- not believable in the least. Worth the $2.99, but not more than that.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|It's a great series. Can follow along with the HBO series easier after reading the books. Would highly recommend this series.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|there are lots of hidden object scenes and fun puzzles to solve. plenty of twists and turns to keep you busy.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use this app daily just wish I could get more detailed info for weekly forecast. Other than that it's great.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Our family is truly action-adventure and science fiction movie fans.  We were very disappointed in this movie.  The plot line jumped from place, and our ability to maintain our suspension of disbelief was thoroughly challenged.  Batman/Wayne is not even in a large portion of the movie.  There were giant plot holes as they attempted to tie up the storyline.  Overall it was too long, the story was poorly written, and even with the action, it was boring.  Disappointing.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|I jumped on this hoping it would let me stream video to my Roku player from my phone, but it can't do that. I wish the description was more clear on what devices it supported. The only device that shows in my network list is a pc with Windows 7 and I get an access denied error when trying to link it to this app.<br /><br />The actual layout of the app is pretty nice but I can't justify the price just to have a curated video collection in one place.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is one of my favourites books. Read it when I was a teen. I am re reading it. What can I say? This is the story of a miserable man, Jean Valjean, who stole a piece of bread for his mother not to die of hunger, but he got caught, he was made a prisioner for 30 years, but...ahh, he manages to escape, he was on the run, the prison director hated him so, Jean Valjean was his reason to live for, to catch him was only his goal. But let's go back to Jean, he gets rich and powerful, with another name, he has a daughter, a foster daughter, but guess what?!!!! Yes the prison director is still after him, and yes he finds him...but the Unthinkable happens... This is a resume, a very short one, because if you didn't reed this you do not know what writing is. This this an outstanding book.

B00A7GWG3Q|5.0|Even if i hadn't had to wait so many years for new Yo, i would still rate this amazing.  It is glorious.  Short and neat (i don't think any tracks break 7 minutes), but it is the same semi-pop, semi-psychedlic, i-refuse-to-pick-a-genre music that i have come to expect from them.  This one can be used as a great demonstration of how vinyl and big speakers should rule the audio world (as opposed to digital files and headphones -- although it does sound lovely on those as well).
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Awesome. I love it already. even though I haven't even played it yet. I love horses and I love animals.
0762777931|5.0|I loved this book from the beginning. Let me say that I've never actually succeeded in sticking to a strictly vegan diet, but anytime I feel like I'm in a funk, I reach for this book and feel inspired to feed my body nourishing green juice, chemical-free snacks, and shake my booty at yoga or Zumba. Her style of writing makes me feel like I have a friend who gets it rooting me on to give up all of the crappy foods that drag me down, and to fill my life with positive energy.

B0076DEJMO|4.0|Like others, I've eagerly awaited the return of Logan Nine-Fingers. In Red Country he's back and we get to see glimpses of both sides of the Logan we've missed. We see the loyal, likeable Logan who lives by a simple code of doing what's right, keeping his word, and standing by his friends. We also get to see the blood-thirsty, psychotic warrior who gleefully plays the part of death incarnate and will dispatch anyone - friend of foe - within reach of his blade. That said, this one was, in truth, a bit long for me and I had to work to get through it. What kept me going was Abercrombie's crisp, smart, witty dialogue, and the not so subtle promise of major confrontations between characters I knew from other books. And therein lies the rub, I made it through this book - and ultimately enjoyed it - but only because I'm an Abercrombie fan and have read his related works. I don't think this one is a stand alone like some of his others. A good read nonetheless for Abercombie fans, but if this is the first read for someone new to Joe Abercrombie's work, I fear it may not make a new fan.

B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Unbelievable how good this album is. For a first one it's pretty well written and produced.<br />Beside 'Home', there is more gems to discover; really a pleasure to listen (in a loop these days :-))<br />I have no doubt Phillip Phillips is here to stay.<br />Looking forward for more.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|This show was very well done.  It was entertaining, great story and even better to know that it was a true story.  Would highly recommend it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Nice finish to the series. Loved it....just wish Katniss had evolved more as a character and &#34;learned&#34; from her trials.
B004QX07G4|1.0|I was sadly disappointed. I've read her previous books and always found them to be hilarious but this book was rarely funny enough to even bring me a chuckle.
B00068TJM6|5.0|The watch is perfect...very heavy...looks amazing...my only complaint is that when I received it, you could tell that someone had it before and that it had been returned because the tag was off and laying in the small plastic bag that also included the extra links in case you needed to make the band bigger...which I did...but disappointed that the &#34;pegs&#34; didn't come with it...that cost $5.00 per peg from jewelry store.  Other than that, great product.
B007TTFXC0|4.0|I have loved Amy Macdonald since I first heard her - years ago, when the only place I could find her CD was on Amazon. I still like her first album the best, but enjoy how she has matured her style.  Her lyrics are so refreshing.  She has a really clean and pleasing sound.

0547260695|5.0|I bought two of these delightful books for granddaughters for Christmas. The pop-ups are beautiful and the story is timeless. One caution, the book is a little fragile and will not withstand rough use. This is a great time to settle for bed book that you can enjoy with little ones.  This is really a special book.
0439023521|5.0|Read The Hunger Games on my Kindle during a very busy with work but could not put it down so I finished it in 3 days. It was thrilling, exhilarating, and addictive. My first by Suzanne Collins - I loved the powerful descriptions, the subtle humor, and the precise way she made me picture the depth of pain and joy in the moments throughout. Her writing style is now one of my favorites. She doesn't  use big fancy chunky words, and yet she uses her vocabulary brilliantly to describe and to pull you into the world of her imagination.<br /><br />I admit, I was really hoping for a coup d'etat of sorts to rise up and change the outcome completely but no such thing! The reality for the Panem citizens does not change and the future looks grim as ever. And yet, to find hope and happiness even if transitory ... I loved the story.<br /><br />The ending did not leave us with a cliff hanger so I am not dying to read the rest of what happens to Katniss and Peeta, but I love to read more of Collins. She is a phenomenal writer.<br /><br />Have not watched the movie ... yet. My rule is simple: If the book came before the movie, read the book first. The original should set the stage.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Action packed with some humor too.  I usually don't like this kind of move so much but (surprisingly to me) I liked it a lot.
B0030B0S2Q|2.0|Moon came in under the radar for me, a weird geek and hardcore movie lover. I fed into the great press and audience reviews and was very, very, underwhelmed. Director Duncan Jones tries to do a lot with very little, only he chose to cast Sam Rockwell who lacks the chops to pull off this sort of lead role. Much like [[ASIN:B0026O475M Cast Away]], we have a classic man vs. himself story that reeks of both physical isolation as much as it does internal loneliness. This is where the problem lies. Sam Rockwell is half asleep throughout most of this movie, even after one of his 'clones' starts to decompose, spitting out teeth and barfing up puddles of blood. Kevin Spacey's voice as on-deck AI 'GERTY' is a reprieve, though it's no HAL 9000. More absent than anything else, is the suspense element that kept Moon's predecessors going, like the Alien franchise for instance. The lunar base that serves as 80% of the movie's setting is spartan, sterile, and lacks the attention-grabbing details of a Ridley Scott set piece. The moon itself is left as one big desert of gray dust, and Duncan Jones uses the frequent lunar vehicle scenes more as filler than a clever showcase of high tech machinery. By the time the credits rolled, I was bored out of my skull and half-asleep myself.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|I just wanted to watch my animes but I can't cause none of this stuff works so now I sad!!!!!!!!!!!
B003TSDI0E|5.0|Brilliant, thought provoking book. Not one to rush reading, but a page or two a day and let it sink in.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|expansion costs are way too high to progress.  Otherwise cute ideas.  Graphics are nice.  I don't buy extras at all.
B009HELT3C|2.0|The whole movie just seemed stretched on material for the movie. The villain of the movie is one of the worst villains i have experienced in any movie. I enjoyed the other movies and actually wanted to see this one but was really disappointed. Would not watch again or recommend anyone waste their money on even a rental.
B003DZX44I|5.0|This is my favorite Disney Movie by far.  I love the story line and how it plays out.  I enjoyed watching it in English and in French.

B008US25E8|4.0|It's been a long and strange trip this last decade for the band Aerosmith. After the lukewarm reception of their 2001 album \\"Just Push Play\\", they released \\"Honkin' on Bobo\\"- an album featuring covers of blues songs. After that, they released two greatest hits albums- one for their former label (Geffen) and one for their current label (Columbia). They tried recording a new album in 2009 with producer Brendan O'Brien (Rage Against The Machine, Pearl Jam, AC/DC), but nothing ever materialized from the recording sessions. Later on, an illness sidelined lead singer Steven Tyler which put Aerosmith on temporary hiatus. The remaining members considered soldering on with a new lead singer, until Tyler was provoked by issuing a legal suit. They then returned to the studio by attempting to finish their long delayed album- that is, until Steven Tyler accepted the position as a judge on the television series \\"American Idol\\". In Fall 2012, after a long delay, the band finally released their newest studio effort \\"Music From Another Dimension!\\".<br /><br />While Brendan O'Brien was part of the initial recording process, in the end he was replaced. Returning to the Aerosmith fold are producers Jack Douglas (Who produced \\"Toys In The Attic\\"), and sometime Aerosmith songwriter Marti Frederiksen (Who co-produced \\"Just Push Play\\"). Also making their return is longtime collaborator Desmond Child, who co-writes the closing track \\"Another Last Goodbye\\". Almost fifteen years after \\"I Don't Want To Miss A Thing\\", Aerosmith sings another Diane Warren penned track. This time around, they sing the inspirational power ballad \\"We All Fall Down\\". If the song \\"Legendary Child\\" sounds very much like a Bryan Adams song, it should being it was penned with Adams' songwriting partner Jim Vallance. However, they do a great cover of the Temptations' song \\"Shakey Ground\\"- which can only be found on the Walmart editions of their album. \\"Music From Another Dimension!\\" at times sounds like vintage Aerosmith. Other times, it sounds as if they're trying too hard to appeal to a younger audience. Look no further than the song \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" which features a seemingly out of place guest appearance from \\"American Idol\\" singer Carrie Underwood. Despite the schmaltzy factor overpowering a significant amount of the album, it's actually worth checking out. \\"Music From Another Dimension!\\" is a good record from Aerosmith, a band that has kept on rocking for 40 years straight..

B001PPGAIA|3.0|This 2 hour and forty minute epic is a fairly entertaining adventure but filled with spots so cheesy that it's almost painful. The CGI is extremely poor is some spots which took away some glamour because it wasn't even necessary during some scenes to have it.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is amazing and is the main reason I'd recommend this film to anyone. His work is as top notch as ever and brilliantly acted throughout this entire saga. Nicole Kidman performs nicely as well but Hugh Jackman just rose above everyone else.<br /><br />It's hard to say who the target audience was when you go from one scene of over the top happy giddy family moments to fairly intense murders that would be deemed too much for younger viewers but other than a very small handful of scene it almost feels like a family adventure movie more than a sprawling romantic piece.<br /><br />Everything could have been wrapped up and finished after the 1 and a half mark. Everything after that point felt unnecessary and almost like a completely different movie.<br /><br /> It was good but I probably won't watch it again at least for a while.

B000G6R7B8|5.0|I tend to buy watches on sale and picked up this one for $49 and change about a month ago. It has been an excellent performer in this time period, averaging about 6 secs per day fast. The watch has a very readable face and the nylon band is quite comfortable ...it's so light, you almost forget you're wearing it. I have 4 other Seiko 5 series watches and of all of them, this one is the most accurate and cheapest one of the bunch. Get it on sale if you can!

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This is the best tv show i've ever seen. If your a horror fan u must watch this show, the story has twist that will keep you wondering threw the whole season. If you like great story lines,murder mysteries,and/or ghost you have to give this series a chance.
B0072IS13G|5.0|This figure is very well made and has been flying around the house without a scratch to the paint.  A great toy for those kids with huge imagination.  It also came faster than I thought.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|There's been something lacking in the past few h.o/adventure games Ive played lately but this game has everything I love in it! The story is cool the graphics are amazing and the H.O and puzzles are challenging. I was so involved in the game then the demo ended...I screamed...noooo...and bought the full version.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The point of story is told from an awkward and innocent teenager. It takes place in the 90s. It's a heartbreaking story about how book smart meets street smart.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book. I read the book in less than two days. Every chance I had, I read.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|An addicting game that my son loves. A little too limited with what you can do without spending a fair amount of money to continue at a steady pace through the game though. It has some bugs in it that need to be cleaned up, especially when you try to access the social network it freezes the kindle.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|It's hard. I have a really hard time leveling up and I die so easily I like it but it would be more interesting  if their was more role-playing and more plot other than let's bounce some heads around for a few hours. I get it I just thought there would be more quests to do. It was fun if you just like killing over and over but I like adventuring and finding things too. If this game had that it would be perfect.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read, if not the best.  I loved it  so much!  Amazing
B0055SWM08|5.0|Relaxing and fun, these puzzles are increasingly challenging as you advance. Lovely graphics and sound, I'm enjoying Quell very much!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World takes the reader through WWII as seen through characters that were introduced in &#34;Fall of Giants&#34;.  Like other novels by Ken Follett, this one is also well researched and full of factual information.  The historical novel is made even more credible by the inclusion of personalities of world leaders such as FDR and Churchhill.  Full of action and spiced with the drives of human nature, it is a good read.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The Blueray quality is fantastic. Just wish that  G3 lived up to the other two installments, but that can't be fixed.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Enjoyed reading the first book of the &#34;Old Man' s War&#34; series. The book was well paced and quick read. John Scalzi's story about how future space wars could be fought and the technology used was engaging. Highly recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I love the setting and characters and Seasons 1 and 2 - so my holdover affection for the show made season 3 episodes 1-3 watchable. However, they were repetitive, implausible, and most of all, horribly predictable.<br />The first 2 episodes were made nearly unbearable by the gruesome appearance and over-acting of..... (no, didnt see it coming...)<br />Shirley McClaine! She was awful - and like Lord Grantham, I was very pleased to see here depart back to America. Perhaps this is why PBS and/or the producers literally snuck the first two episodes in without fanfare or notice, never to be seen again. I started with Episode 3, but quickly realized something was amiss. I went onto Amazon to watch the missing episodes - don't bother! As for episode 3. I can at least say that the show quickly (mercifully) wrapped up the opening story lines, so perhaps the rest of the season will bounce back to its former quality and style.<br />SEASON END UPDATE - Several of the story lines were back to top form but overall still a substantial drop off. Why they rushed to the finale by doubling the episodes was a mystery and the content of 2 hours was the same as 1 normal show - so again a disappointment. Sample nitpick - Did they somehow forget to explain why Bates was such a big shot in the prison? And without adding a spoiler I can say the finale was a big disappointment. Seems like the whole production became business and market ($$$) driven - like an American soap opera. That said I plan to watch Season 4 as this show - even with its drop - is still in the top tier of TV and movie productions.

B004ZA9HB4|4.0|I don't write reviews, but felt I had to toss one up for this FAOTD. First, skip the gripes about Facebook login. As an earlier review said, if you hit skip at initial setup, you won't be bugged to loving again. Second, you need a DLNA-capable device on your LAN for this to be useful. I have a Samsung TV, which is what I used for testing.  I also noticed an X-box that just happened to be nonlinear was also an option, which I will test later.<br /><br />Streaming was easy, with HD vids looking excellent. There was some slight buffering, but that's got to be expected when you're using a Kindle to pull video from the Internet and push it across the network. I only give this a 4 out of 5 for one reason - content. The media available is decent, leaning towards the geek side, natch. That's fine by me, but may not keep everyone coming back to the app. The app really shined when streaming my own videos to the TV. Since they were all HD, they came across clear and fast. A nice touch is having volume control with a swipe on the right side of the screen.<br /><br />All in all, this app adds another solid option to get media viewable throughout the home.

B00006RCOB|3.0|Overlong but satisfying techno-thriller from Clint Eastwood — an unusual change of pace for the actor-director. &#34;Firefox&#34; (1982) benefits from a strong supporting cast and John Dykstra's impressive visual effects. Relatively humorless by Eastwood standards, yet great fun when it takes flight. Classic dialogue: &#34;Think in Russian.&#34;
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This true story is a Cold War-era spy thriller that switches over to a Hollywood satire and back with almost Sorkin-esque repartee throughout.  When our embassy in Tehran, Iran is stormed by Ayatollah Khomeini's followers, six staffers snuck out the back door and hid in the Canadian ambassador's house during the commotion.  The State Department keeps coming up with one bad idea after another on how to get them out, until [[ASIN:0060957913 exfiltration expert Tony Mendez]], after talking to his son on the phone about the kid's TV choices, hatches the only viable option: claim that the staffers are a Canadian film crew scouting locations for a [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars]] knockoff called \\"[[ASIN:0060567236 Argo]].\\"  As there's a Persian community in Los Angeles that could report back to Iran that no such production exists if one of their relatives called to check, this requires the enlistment of [[ASIN:B001DHXT6G Star Trek]] makeup technician John Chambers to build up an elaborate cover legend of not only the production company but also the requisite press publicity to make it all plausible...and all while the Revolutionary Guard are going door-to-door executing anyone who is saying nice things about the US.<br /><br />Simultaneously tense and hilarious, this dramatization of this audacious black op that earned Mendez the CIA's answer to the Medal Of Honor and had to be kept classified in order to prevent retaliation against the hostages they already held is definitely worthy of all its critical accolades.  The recovering Tom Clancy fanboy in me enjoyed the old-school spycraft angle, and the Hollywood power player-in-waiting in me reveled in the portions in LA where Mendez, Chambers and the producer they enlist to make it plausible wheel, deal and scam their way to that end, such as staging an in-costume table read for the benefit of the press just to have something in the trades that the Iranians could look at.  It all puts to rest the GOP's claims that Hollywood hates America.tes America.
B007SGM084|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the ease of read to these books.  This is not just a trilogy of sex but a revelation of humanity between a man and a woman at it's best.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|When I first started reading the Fifty series, I had a hard time getting into them. At some point I then had a hard time putting them down. I absolutely enjoyed this book.
B005LAIGN2|2.0|I actually thought this would be factually accurate when i purchased it, however it appears to me that they are trying to re-write history quite a bit!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was very annoyed that this instant video kept stopping in mid-episode. The screen would go suddenly dark and I would have to return to the home screen to begin again. This happened on an average of 1-2 times an episode. I will consider carefully before I buy Amazon Instant Video again.

B000EZ7ZZE|4.0|If you are the type of person that enjoyed the first movie, you will probably like this one even more.  The movie starts to track the video game more closely and introduces the Jill Valentine character from the game.  Jill and Alice make a great combo and the production is higher budget with better special effects and more action than the first movie.  There are a couple of really unique action sequences that I have not seen done before.  The entire key is to accept the premise of the movie and understand that the story and character development is mostly a backdrop to transition between action set pieces.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|In many trilogies the second novel can be painful...but not this one.  Follett again kept me wanting more as the families I'd grown to know in Fall of Giants continued to grow.  There were surprises and I was pleased to be caught off guard.  Most of the story line was easy to see actually happening, but I will admit that a small part or two were a bit far fetched and seemed included only as a way to somehow continue a story line into the final novel ... stretching?  Hopefully Follett will let some story lines die with dignity rather than keep them alive on life support.  And lastly, I promise to never read a Follett novel again IF after finishing this trilogy some stereotypical character aspects are not more accurately portrayed, developed, and resolved (Chuck, Jackie, Bea).  I'm in for finishing the triathlon...don't let me down Mr. Follett.

0525958002|5.0|I realize that as a long-time fan, that I would be biased towards nearly anything that a band member wrote. However, this is a very intriguing memoir that sucks you in and has more than a few sections that I am still thinking about.<br /><br />John's description of the early years had me transfixed, and looking up various artists that he wrote about and searching for music that they'd written or performed. I appreciate a book that has me learning more about particular time periods and eras! John also had me chuckling at a number of points which is testament to a definite wry sense of humor so well loved in our British cousins \\"across the pond\\".<br /><br />His drug addiction, rehab and subsequent long-term committment to stay sober is encouraging: To know  there is hope for all of those who struggle with substance abuse. It's especially good to hear after seeing the band perform way back during the \\"Big Thing\\" tour and thinking that John looked completely wasted on stage. My friends and I were devastated that he looked so awful and that one of our heroes was clearly drugged out of his mind. He's come a long way and I hope that life continues to get better for all of the band mates.<br /><br />Well done John!

B00008OWZC|5.0|I was given this CD this past Christmas. It's the only Zeppelin CD/Album I didn't have, and I can't believe it took me so long to add this one to my collection. This album has quickly become one of my favorites.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of live albums. Often the sound quality suffers, and the vocals are not as good. And, for me, all the background screaming and applause only interrupts the listening experience when I'm just sitting in my house and not at a concert. I've had Zeppelin's live album The Song Remains The Same since I was a teenager, a year or two after it came out. And while I like the album, it's never been among my favorites. This one captures the mood and the band's essence so much better. The sound quality is perfection. There isn't a lot of background interference. The songs are Zeppelin at their peak. Robert Plant's vocals give me chills. Jimmy Page shreds his guitar in ways we never hear in studio recordings. Hearing John Bonham play the drums like no other is bittersweet. And, of course, John Paul Jones is right there with them, making musical perfection.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|The book is funny and interesting.  I got the kindle edition, and was unable to see the figures like a script from 30 rock because they don't scale when you increase the text size.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is. AWESOME APP!!!!! so don't get the lite one because if you do you don't get to keep your world for free!!!!! if you try to go on it again then it says you have to pay to get. then I looked at this one and it was the same price comparing to the real game&iexcl;!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!&iexcl;!!#!##

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't usually read books about cancer because it's obvious what's going to happen in the end, but this book...... I'm speechless. This book had me laughing and crying. It's so beautifully written that it has become one of my favorite novels. This is a true love story.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|The movie arrived very quickly and in time for Christmas.  He really liked the movie.  It was very well packaged to avoid damage prior to arriving.
B000FC1336|5.0|The author has a grip on the inner workings of the US Navy. He gets into the charters with such detail that you feel you know them personally. The action is non stop and the story line is so real that it is a little scary because it could happen!
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Our book club read it. I found it interesting. There were some great quotes that we discussed. But when recommending books tot others I find that this is not a book that I say

B004ZA9HB4|5.0|All of these people complaining about needing to login with fb need to READ. You can easily tap the SKIP link to avoid the fb connection. This app just amazed me and my old DLP TV. It connected instantly and painlessly through my Samsung Hte-6500 home theater receiver - blu-ray player. In seconds I was streaming JFK from Discovery onto my 65&quot; TV with no wires.<br />I'm completely blown away and so excited to get a free app of the day that I find usefull instead of another retarded useless game. (Sorry, just not a gamer)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game I just cant stop playing but I don't like the upgrade. but me and my kids love it

B002KREVCO|5.0|Everything I was hoping it would, old and newer videos, I loved the one with Arnold for &#34;Action Hero&#34; never knew was ever made.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Amidst the destruction of World War 2, a conflict that produced a genocide heretofore unknown and the killing of so many others together with massive destruction, a glimmer of hope and reaffirmation appears in this remarkable book.  One might ask how can you read of this war and feel good at its conclusion?  The answer will envelop you even before the last page is read.  Read it folks and let your emotions run free.  It's a goody.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I received the complete Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman series as a Christmas gift.  I love it.  I have watched around 7 episodes so far.  I use to watch it when it was on and really liked it but now I love it even more.  It is a family show with no curse words and teaches family christian values.  All the characters are just wonderful.  My two favorites are Michaela and Sully.  It is a joy to sit back and watch their romance slowly develop. That a big difference from how the so called modern day romances on TV are portrayed today.  Dr. Quinn and Sully's is so much more romantic and exciting.  I would recommend this series to anyone who loves westerns

B0094K1WZE|5.0|This is one of my first movie reviews, so it will be quick. I'd give this movie an 8.9 - wish I could give half stars lol. I always appreciate sequels that maintain or exceed the quality of their predecessors. I loved MI3, in particular, scenes like swinging over to the other building - which had me on the edge of my seat. This movie, I don't think I'd be giving away plot when I say the building scene in this one, with the gloves and then trying to get back down to the room, wow, I was on the edge of my seat again(!) lol. A Great Movie! Happy to Find It on Amazon Prime!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Great music. have listened to the cd, but not seen the DVD yet. Same music as one 21, but also new ones.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Amazing book. I was never a huge Chili Peppers fan but respect them all much more after reading about all the hellish experiences and issues they dealt with to get to where they are now. At points Anthony takes the words right out of your head and puts them on a page, if you've ever experienced something similar to what he talks about. It's a small miracle these 4 guys are all still alive and making music together.<br /><br />This is a great, engaging book. It was hard to put down and easy to spend hours upon hours reading.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|real fast pace you blink you might miss somthing real sci-fi movie good creatures throughout the movie again a goodone to have from  oh10
B005LAIIQC|3.0|This was a disaster for us.  Count us in on the Bourne list and know that we have the whole set and feel sorry about our purchase of this edition.  I had to watch it the second time just to feel as if I understood it and would not be in a good spot to answer that now.  It was mediocre at best and lacked many of the thrilling parts we have become grown to like.  There were scenes that seemed to last forever with one person chasing another.  I was told years ago by a Hollywood type that extended driving, running, kissing and excessive none verbal scenes were used to put time on the clock instead of paying the writers for writing and for the actors to get paid without having to perform an abundance of acting.<br /><br />I ran the movie through the Blu-ray at first and the sound was as awful as could be.  It did not appear to have the same coding as the player.  I normally run the volume at 20 for full surround sound; however, with this one I had to crank it up to 25-30 depending on the type of scene.  Normal talking required 30 while action and shoot 'em up scenes had to be lowered to avoid blasting out the sub-woofers.  When I watched it the second time on the regular DVD it was just a crummy movie and too bad I had to actually hear all the wasted movements.<br /><br />Maybe a 3 star is too high but the movie is just O.K. and not so much to be thrilled about.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Because of the movie the book`s price on Kindle was raised to $10.00, despite having been witten in 2006. I could have purchased a paperback for less. I find this practice very sleazy on Kindle`s part. From now on I will check the price twice before buying an ebook from Kindle.
B00422LESO|2.0|Did not hold my attention.  Boring. Very disappointed and wish I hadn't bought it.  Did not do Jane Austen justice.
B004N66XYE|5.0|This continuation of the series from years ago is splendid and tops the original I believe. If you like Downton Abbey then this new series is for you.
0345529057|5.0|Can i really give this series 5stars? yes i can, why because it also came out as a show. Not everyone may like it, however I do. I enjoyed reading it before it became a show, and even more so because I'm now also rereading the books. If youre into fantasy, mid evil knights, here is your solution.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I chose this rating because i really liked the book.<br />I liked the book because it really told me what was happening.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I ordered this on Thursday and I'm wearing it on Saturday. That's quick and awesome considering I live in Hawaii. Nice looking watch. I have big wrists and the band has enough holes to accommodate my wrist. The watch is high quality and great for the price. I imagine you could wear this watch with a suit or with a t-shirt and still make a statement. It's classy. Its automatic and doesn't require a battery, so I'm intrigued to see how that feature works.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm not one who reads the bestseller just because others do, but for once on a whim, I did. This book isn't your typical love story. It shows true struggles and teaches you to appreciate the people you have in your life. Hazel and Gus face the unthinkable together and they are truly blessed along their difficult journey. I definitely recommend this book for anyone.

B007THA4FI|4.0|JK Rowling has something to say about small town culture and the petty mindedness of humanity in general.  In the first few chapters, it can feel very offensive. But if you stick with it, there is something beautiful there as well, and a message for all of us to look beyond our own concerns and empathize with people in other circumstances.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love the story line.  Characters are great.  Funny movie with great singing and dancing! Recommend to anyone who loves movies with singing in them.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Perfect action movie - kept moving the whole way through.  Aaron Cross was more fun than Jason Bourne (though I loved the first three).  Highly recommend.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|There are many types of sci fi-- sci-fi horror (i.e. Alien, Predator, etc), sci-fi terror (i.e. Cloverfield, Mist), sci-fi adventure (Star Trek, Star Wars, etc.), mystical sci-fi (ET, Close Encounters, Contact, etc.) and then there's a relatively new kid on the block, sci-fi comedy.<br /><br />\\"Paul\\", the movie, comes under the last category. It fits in well with movies like \\"Men in Black\\", \\"Galaxy Quest\\", but adds something of a twist, a heavy dosing of vulgarity and \\"low\\" and obvious slapstick comedy. This movie is actually a very broad parody of almost every other sci-fi movie ever made. And it pulls it off pretty well.<br /><br />So let's get this bit out of the way first:<br /><br />This is probably not a movie for kids, any more than the stuff on South Park or Family Guy is really for kids.<br /><br />Some kids probably would enjoy it (they are sophisticated, more than many adults would like to admit), but some parents might not appreciate it.<br /><br />For adults or those who have no problems with vulgarity - i.e. fart jokes, \\"cussing\\", and the like, it won't be a problem. And let's face it. Many of us live in a world where \\"cussing\\" and fart jokes are normal and we accept them as part of the human condition.<br /><br />None of this in the movie particularly bothered me, and in some places it even added to the humor. However, not everyone would appreciate it, which is why I point it out right away.<br /><br />So what does the movie have going FOR it, besides the \\"low\\" comedy? Well, pretty much everything else works brilliantly!<br /><br />First of all, it's very entertaining, with some real suspense and a sense of adventure.<br /><br />Basically, the story is about two \\"nerds\\" from the UK who start an adventure in the U.S. by visiting Comic Con and eventually wind up rescuing an alien (Paul) who is running from the U.S. Government. This has sort of been done before in a few movies, but what makes this film stand out is the approach they use.<br /><br />To start, almost every character in the film begins as a stereotype. The lead characters (nerds) Graeme and Clive, are stereotypes of nerds, especially those who are mistaken for being gay as well.<br /><br />They have an early run-in with two other characters who are stereotypes of hillbilly red-necks.<br /><br />The government agents are stereotypes of secret service agents, whose \\"boss\\" (played by Signourny Weaver) is a stereotypical power monger intent on recapturing Paul for some vivisection.<br /><br />Along the way our duo (who become a trio once Paul shows up) meet a \\"born again Christian\\" woman (the love interest named Ruth) and are chased by her very religious father, again both stereotypes.<br /><br />In any good work of fiction, characters must develop through the story. The same is true of this movie. By starting the characters as stereotypes, the scriptwriters kind of cheat, because the characters have no place to go but up.<br /><br />So it is no surprise that the \\"nerds\\" turn out to have genuine feelings and sensitivity, the \\"born again Christian\\" woman has her eyes opened to the marvels of the Universe and turns out to be the horniest thing in the West, and the government agent \\"bad guy\\" turns out to be a \\"good guy\\" in disguise.<br /><br />But not everyone develops. The stereotypical red-neck hillbillies get written out early on and Signourney Weaver's \\"The Big Guy\\" is such a stereotype that she doesn't even have a name, and never gets a chance to develop - but I won't say why because that's one of the surprises in the movie.<br /><br />Much of all this will seem a bit familiar, as the treatment has been done before in many films. What makes it fun are the plot twists that cause these changes (or lack of them) in the characters.<br /><br />And since fun is the whole point of the movie (you know it will have a happy ending - but typically only after a shockingly unexpected near tragedy) we have to give a big thumbs UP to the main character, who is not human and who does NOT develop in the movie, Paul, the alien.<br /><br />Paul is of course modeled after the stereotypical \\"grays\\" that have been in pop culture since Roswell. It is one thing to see a picture or drawing of such a creature, it is quite another to see one so animated and life-like! Whoever made the character (is it a puppet or a CGI or both?) deserves an award for production excellence. The character is very believable in movements and expression and has the most amazing hands and fantastic eyes! Very compelling.<br /><br />Move over Yoda, Paul is in town (at least until the mothership arrives) and he is a genuine STAR!<br /><br />Paul, the alien, as a character does not develop in the film because he is already fully developed - sort of. He is not what you'd expect from an alien. He is crass and vulgar, rude and obscene, but he is amazingly loveable for it all and has a heart of gold. He doesn't have any great spiritual message from the cosmos. His message is to enjoy life and what you have, and stay clear of the government. Pretty good advice when you think about it.<br /><br />He drinks, \\"cusses\\", smokes (both cigarettes and weed), and generally is a \\"party alien\\". He is more down to earth and human than his fellow characters in the film. So in this way we get another twist... Paul the alien, teaches the humans how achieve their human potential by being more human and earthy than they are! He never preaches this, he just does it, and it works.<br /><br />Paul, the alien is a magical being (as any good space alien is) with special abilities. I won't spoil the surprises by describing them. Suffice it to say we've seen them before in other movies, but never used like they are here. Once more the comic jabs come out in full force as the film reveals Paul's magical alien powers, usually through comedy.<br /><br />Another bit of fun in this move are the many nods and take offs of other sci fi films in pop culture. We see wonderful take offs on Star Wars (there is a bar scene where they play the same music as in the Cantina scene of the first Star Wars), Close Encounters, Aliens, and of course, ET. In fact this movie might be considered ET \\"grown up\\". Less gooshy and more gutteral, yet at the end, equally touching in a different sort of way.<br /><br />I found the film to be very entertaining, I don't mind the vulgarity at all. I like the suspense and plot twists. Like Galaxy Quest, it is loaded with \\"inside jokes\\" and this is one of few science fiction films I find worth owning, rather than renting, because it is worth many viewings.<br /><br />Congratulations to everyone involved in this gem of a sci-fi comedy!<br /><br />Great fun!an and who does NOT develop in the movie, Paul, the alien.<br /><br />Paul is of course modeled after the stereotypical \\"grays\\" that have been in pop culture since Roswell.

I found an audio recording onthe internet, of the real speech by the real king, and the actor in the movie repeated the speech word-for-word, hesitation-for-hesitation.  The movie portrays a very difficult time in England and does it very well.

B007UXSPK2|5.0|This hit the spot - light, fun action movie.  Tom Cruise was born to play this part.  It was fun, interesting, it kept moving, and it had a very funny low tech twist on the usual Mission Impossible gadgetry.  You can't watch it and not be entertained.
B008NR8YTQ|4.0|MOORE, Gary. Blues for Jimi.  Eagle. 2012.  $9.99.<br />GM, guit, voc; Dave Bronze, b; Darrin Mooney, dr; guests Billy Cox, b, voc, and Mitch Mitchell, dr.<br /><br />In 2007, ex-Thin Lizzie guitarist Moore held a concert at the London Hippodrome, playing songs from the Jimi Hendrix Experience.  Moore had been fifteen when he heard the Experience perform live in Belfast  in 1967 and he still remembered Hendrix's take on \\"Foxey Lady,\\" which Moore included in his set here. Moore's drummer for the evening was Primal Scream alumnus Mooney; bassist Bronze had played for Clapton and Art of Noise. Later in the set, Hendrix alumni Cox and Mitchell came on stage to play \\"Red House,\\" \\"Hey Joe\\" and \\"Stone Free.\\" The set starts with a blistering rendition of \\"Purple Haze,\\" followed by \\"Manic Depression\\" and Foxey Lady.\\" It ends with \\"Hey Joe\\" and \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return).\\" Every song on the album is from Hendrix's repertoire, with the possible exception of a short riff entitled \\"My Angel,\\" which precedes Moore's playing of Hendrix's \\"Angel.\\"<br /><br />How good is it?  D**ned good. Moore plays blistering guitar. While he follows Hendrix's lines for the most part, he isn't a slave to them and he's a bear of a guitarist. He's less good on the vocals but not bad, just not Jimi. It was a treat to hear Mitch Mitchell playing the Experience's old songs again. For all the debate as to who was the best rock drummer -Ginger Baker or whoever--I always felt it was Mitchell, in that short space of time when he played with Noel Redding and Hendrix in the first version of the Experience. I still remember sitting in the third or fourth row of the second balcony of Wolsey Hall at Yale in the summer of 1967, the amplified bass and guitar lines hitting me so loud that my chest bone throbbed. And down there on the stage, Mitchell flailed away, in a concentrated burst of energy that drove the music forward. That Mitchell, alas, was not there this night -he sounds a bit rusty, maybe slightly short of wind--playing with Moore, but it's still fun hearing him again.<br /><br />A year later -2008-- Mitch Mitchell was dead. A few years more -in 2011-- and Moore was dead too. I'm glad this album is still around to commemorate that special evening when they got to play those familiar songs together.hort of wind--playing with Moore, but it's still fun hearing him again.<br /><br />A year later -2008-- Mitch Mitchell was dead.

B00479SVBU|1.0|I am using this SATECHI FM Transmitter for 6 months. Sound clarity is great, I never had any problem with this unit. But there is one feature which is manual and that is also listed in the website. This device does not memorize the point where you left off before you switch off your car. You have to manually create a bookmark with your remote or by pressing the button on the unit. This one missing feature made the device useless for me. And this feature is a great hassle for me.<br /><br />Updated:<br /><br />Its more than a year the FM Transmitter problems have never been sorted out, which makes it a useless product and useless company.

B00A2BTCTC|5.0|Love the repackaging! Although Hemispheres is my favorite Rush album, 2112 is a very close second, followed by Caress of Steel.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|...Great Bag, fits  everything....5 stars  what else can I say about  this  back bag, very well made , not  too big, and  not  small.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|This is a very underrated movie.  It's a fast paced, ultra-violent, sci-fi movie.  Karl Urban is fantastic as Judge Dredd.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|This is one of the best free apps out there. Haven't progressed too far, but have seen adv and yes, one must buy advanced equipment. Neither adv nor money input is obnoxious. Tennis fans will like the game and love the price.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Good just great liked the twist in the story when she learned more of her past and found them to be true
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|When I would plug my headphones in this app would over ride all others and start playing music, had to delete.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Another great series to add to our collection.  If you are a biker, you will love these movies.  Action packed.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Found the new dredd very disapointing. Lack depth and had very little suspense. The origonal was better. Acting was poor. Over all I wouldnt watch again even if it were free.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This was a good read..the connection between characters is very powerful.  It also had some unexpected twists which made it interesting.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love the book, cant wait for the sequel. Almost the same ad 50Shades but still entirely different in its own way.
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|Hilarious, fell in love with Becky in this book. Her crazy ways of getting out of situations she gets herself in.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is a great story and well told too.It is wonderful and magical for mid level readers.It will take you to a whole new world.
034580404X|5.0|I bought these individually for my Kindle but HAD to have a paperback copies.  The font is smaller than most books.
B0086700CM|5.0|very addicting little free game as well as challenging! I have enjoyed it a lot and not been able to put down either! my thumbs grow tired but I can't wait to see how far I go every time
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was one of the best  books I have read in a long time. It kept me on the edge of my seat. I would highly recommend it.
1878424319|5.0|If you have an open mind, and are willing to accept new ideas and beliefs, then this book can change your life. This book has changed my way of viewing situations and things around me,and even saved my parents marriage. I can't understand how anybody could give this book anything below five stars, but if your looking for a way of living a better life, then this book is for you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We had never watched this series before but had it highly recommended.  Good thing.  After one episode we were kind of non-excited--but kept on.  The series gets on a roll after a few episodes, makes more sense, sorts out the characters, etc.  Has many little surprising twisits.  Very enjoyable.
B003E8GQ76|4.0|Another entertaining Clooney flick. The guy really is a modern day Carey Grant (with a bit of Rat Pack thrown in). This movie is a perfect vehicle for him, and he does a great job at portraying this thick skinned, no strings, company axe man. It has a great story with great performances. Talent definitely didn't skip a generation for director, Jason Reitman (son of Ivan Reitman, director of the Ghostbusers franchise)! Check it out.
B00846REIS|5.0|Ordered this on my Kindle but thoroughly enjoyed the reading book.  Sylvia Day is another great author with must read books.
B004X0XXFC|5.0|Music from back when you could enjoy the whole album, not just one or two tracks.  This album defined the 80's for me.
B005ZMUXDC|4.0|Tangled is a good film for a family to laugh and make a few memories. :) A few scary scenes with the &#34;step mom&#34; but otherwise it's great through and through. Bravo!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|the best for kindle fire! I love it! Especially to use for pics! It has a bunch of fun stuff to use for your pics!
B001ILFUD2|5.0|Good story, but fabulous music and cast.  Bette Midler, Billy Joel--Cheech Marin!  What a combination!!  We now have a cat named Oliver in honor of this cute movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man - Great Vince Flynn novel, a real page turner. Mitch Rapp solves the problems in heroic fashion, too bad we don't have more &#34;real agents&#34; such as Mitch.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|This is a piece of history for an group of singers.  It's a wonderful album to add to your collection
1449410243|3.0|I expected something like &#34;101 things to do with a dead cat&#34;,  Did not realise it was like a manga cartoon
B006LSZECO|4.0|I did not like a single person in this book....yet couldnt put it down.  I would give it a five but the ending was rather bland.
034580404X|5.0|I bought this for my mom for her birthday. I read it first and loved it! Before my mom could read it, my dad picked it up and now they are reading it together. Love it!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought this cd when I heard one of her songs and loved it. This whole cd is great. She has a wonderful voice.
1451695195|4.0|Found this book very interesting! Love to read all the different angles on this subject. Would recommend this book to all those who are interested in this topic.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was told it was a must read series but disappointed when I realized it was a story about children killing children.  Very descriptive.
1594481717|5.0|If you judged this book by its cover, you might not<br />let it in your house. Maybe the worst cover on a good<br />book I have ever seen. It doesn't say much for<br />right-brainers like myself.<br />I actually cut the cover and frontispiece off; the graphics<br />are pathetic - and there is even a cut-out. I gave the<br />book a prosthetic cover<br />The contents - GREAT - but I am a professional artist,<br />and I couldn't stand that cover in my home.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story takes you in from the first few pages.  The character development is superb, the story line fast moving. I'm already looking for time to read book 2!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|[Sigh] Yet another time travel plot with too many \\"loop\\" holes.  I actually rented this film, watched half of it and didn't get back to it before the 24hours expired.  My wife convinced me to save the $4 of re-renting and just read the wikipedia summary.  Good move.  It's terrible, filled with holes, and will send your mind spinning in useless time travel circles.  It would be great if hollywood would give up on the time travel genre.  [...]
B00AYB20KI|1.0|Boring movie bottom line wasn't anything scary about it at all. We thought the mother was the best part of the whole move.
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book! It is a clever, engrossing and very well-written thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. This is a definite must read!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ordered this on my Kindle and thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  Sylvia Day is a great author.  Couldn't put the book down.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I just bought my kindle and wanted to try some games.  Its ok. Doing these reviews is a pain in the butt
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great graphics and ambience. Good plot as well. Really enjoyed playing this. Well worth the small cost to pay. Fun!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I found this movie to be highly entertaining.  Sure, the plot was a bit predictable, but it was a musical, not an intense drama!  I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, but quickly forgot it was him. Mr. Baldwin's perfomance was a riot. It was just a great movie for a cold Sunday afternoon.  Now looking forward to my delivery of the CD:)
0374275637|5.0|Daniel Kahneman's book provides excellent insights in the importance and limitation of intuitive thinking. Human tendency to base its decisions on the information at hand, to disregard the basic rules of probability, the law of the small number, and than fact that performances tend over time to regress to the mean, puts limits on our capability to act as rational agents. In addition, as individuals we are limited in our ability to detect shortcomings of our intuitive thinking process. As we are more adapt to identify cognitive shortcomings in the reasoning of other people than in our own, Daniel Kahneman states that organizations have better chances than individuals to improve their decision making process and to avoid biasis; provided they establish rules and procedures thatlimit the risk of \\"groupthink\\".
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|Nothing to write home about... if you can wait for it to become free, it's that kind of movie.<br />I'd give the first one 4 stars, this one 2.5 if the choice was there!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series is written as an adult porn book.  I've read the series several times and absolutely love it.  Very descriptive.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Although I am not a big fan of coming of age romance novels I have to say this is one of the best books I have read lately.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i think this game is great for ur daughter n keeps em busy also its fun oh and very detailed letting them have a feel of being friends with mlp
B004IOP18A|5.0|So much fun to play! The black key's first album is true blues and full of soul. and it's a limited edition 180 gram vinyl.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't get enough of it.  Wish it had many more episodes.  So happy that I found it on Amazon and each episode will update to me the same week that it is shown on TV, since I bought the TV pass.  Great option.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|The acting was well done, perhaps a bit over the top for JGL.  He does resemble a young Bruce Willis quite well with his mannerisms and quirky mouth scrunching......there is a lot of violence as the preview and cover shows. If you feel like watching an action packed, but sometimes slow-moving movie with decent acting and a tiny bit of sci-fi, you may enjoy Looper.  If you are a parent, just watch it after the kids go to sleep (obviously).
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series is written like an adult porn book.  I've read the series several times and absolutely love it.  Very descriptive.
B005BHNCO8|3.0|I was very excited when I bumped into this product here on Amazon, but when I received it, I found out that they sent me the wrong umbrella adapters.  When I contacted the seller, they told me that I had to contact amazon instead because it was an \\"amazon fulfillment product.\\"  I didn't wanna bother with that so I bought two extra umbrella adapters from another brand and it fits just fine.  I'm now enjoying my umbrella kit.  I know it won't last long, especially if you use it a lot on location, but it'll do for now.
B007Z9QS5K|5.0|This DVD is a wonderful mixture of several intertwining stories which run the gambit of emotions! Not much crass language which is good for most ages. I don't recommend it for small children as they would not understand the many story lines. Have a great time with this one!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is addictive. Constantly checking on it so I can build more. This game allows easy purchase of game money &amp; time credits, so parents beware or set controls asap. Great SIM City like game. Would rate it E for everyone. Definitely a time killer :-)
B00AVBHHZE|5.0|I had never seen the movie before but was looking for good movie that was based in Catholicism. After reading several very long, and much better reviews than mine, I decided to buy the movie. What a great purchase. This is now one of my all time favorite movies and I highly recommend this.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Deborah Harkness' Discovery of Witches blends fantasy, past, present and future, as well as compelling characters, and a few delightful houses I wish I could live in.<br /><br />The undercurrent of the genetic backgrounds for her 'creatures' is a wonderful twist on the usual tale, and a deepening look into how we are made -- some of us human, some seemingly otherworldly and some frankly creepy.  What is it that attracts one person to another, or a person to a specific time (historical) or someone else to a specific environment?  How do we define the Real from the Fantastical?<br /><br />These are some of the reasons I love this book.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was told it was a must read series but disappointed when I realized it was a story about children killing children.  Very descriptive.
0345525558|5.0|Loved this book. Great characters and incidental knowledge about the meaning of flowers. I have recommended it to many reader friends and they were not disappointed.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|The Intel Core i7-2600K has been in service for me for many months now and it runs cool and reliable. No burn ups, no recurrent freezes, no blue screens. Running on XP with a Gigabyte motherboard. No complaints. I realize it is a little out of date now, but if one comes your way at a reasonable price, it would be a good purchase. Definitely recommended. I would buy again if there weren't newer, faster, more powerful CPU's that were affordable.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Lots of twists and turns that never stop, it keeps you guessing to the very end, this is a great read
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Eckhart's books are all very good. This was the second book of his that I read and it was very good. The basic theme is focus on today and on what you can control.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This was the best game I ever played hope you enjoy it I completed the whole game in two days I couldn't stop playing today's the second day I just finished it its January 16 get the game it's super fun
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Lots of great music by multiple artists.  Love listening to this while riding to and from work.  You won't be disappointed.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|I liked it well enough, but I thought there was way to much magic for my particular taste. I plan to read the rest in the series. I read the Forge of Darkness, and that was excellent, I am guessing his books get better along the way.
0684857219|5.0|Book arrived on time in great condition, purchased as a gift for my older brother who is a personal trainer/ body builder and he loved it!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Game is good. I just wish free really meant free. You only get to go so far then you have to pay to finish.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Not much to say about this app except it works great and I find myself referencing it a couple of times a day.
0439023521|5.0|I was on the edge on my seat for this entire book, waiting to see what would happen next. I felt like Collins formed her characters and their relationships very well, and the plotline was excellent.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series is written as an adult porn book.  I've read the series several times and absolutely love it.  Very descriptive.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Love love loved it!!!!!! Anyone who enjoys romantic books should read this book. I definitely see myself reading this book again.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I liked this game and might to if you like horses. This might tell you how to care for a real horse.
0670026603|5.0|Thank you JoJo Moyes for writing this amazing story!  This is one of the BEST books I've EVER read!<br /><br />You Before Me sucked me in immediately and was very hard for me to put down. It's beautifully written with engaging characters who will make you laugh and make you cry. Lou and Will come from very different backgrounds and Jojo Moyes did an excellent job of portraying the hardships unique to each family. I enjoyed watching the relationship between Lou and Will develop and the growth they experienced together as well as individually. I felt like a participant in Will's life as opposed to an observer and I have a new found appreciation for what people in his position and those who care for them go through. Their romance is unconventional, but an extraordinary example of what it means to really love someone. Their struggles broke my heart but also challenged me to rethink my opinions about \\"quality of life\\".<br /><br />This really is a must read and not a story you'll soon forget!  I also vote for someone to make this into a movie ASAP!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I must admit I came to the Facebook world very recently. That said it is easy to use, self explanatory and is the easiest communication device out there.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|As much as I hate endings, this was wonderful. There were so many characters who reached there full development in this movie. I love it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was told it was a must read series but disappointed when I realized it was a story about children killing children.  Very descriptive.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down it is good that peeta did not eat the berries because he would be dead if he did
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is one of my favorite Xmas movies.  I enjoyed the black and white version and the colored version is even better.  I was very pleased it arrived on Dec. 24th - in time for Xmas Eve.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The app works great easy to use. But Facebook is Facebook. Zynga makes good games sometimes a little slow. but they still have to develop the games for it
B002RI9UBS|4.0|This book started out a bit slow, but got better as it went on.  A thoroughly enjoyable read, it made you think.
B007SUW24W|5.0|I bought this cd for the sole purpose of having music that was actually good to play in my car. So much better than Nicki Minaj on the radio haha. Honestly, he is my favorite musician.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A new author for me.  If you wonder why I was reading a teen romanace, just stick with it and find out!
0375851569|5.0|My niece loves the books. They arrived in perfect condition. They are in a box that make them the perfect gift as well as protect them while storing. Will purchase again.
B0000549B0|5.0|Harvey has always been one of my favorite James Stewart movie.  It is just as good now as it was the first time I saw it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a good working app and is fun to play. Downloads easy and runs smoothly. Fun to play and easy too play
B0039P1O4O|4.0|This is the first bluetooth I have tried . So far I like it  except I can not get it to understand my comande. Other than that it works great.
159413586X|5.0|To me, this book was the worst in the series. But it did it's job of concluding the series, and it did it fairly well. Would have preferred a different ending, personally.
B008K6DU4Y|2.0|Hangs multiple times. Those restarts are really annoying...<br /><br />But since there are no other players capable of handling MKV format, I'll have to deal with this one..
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book had good character development and the writing style of the first person for each of the main characters worked well.  But, after a while the twists and turns of the plot really started to stretch.  But I accepted this as the direction the story was going, but it just klept going.  It seemed like the author was at a stopping point several times and then decided to add another chapter or two. After all the different directions the author moved us in, I expected more of a &#34;payoff&#34; in the final chapter.  Instead it just stopped!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Each book just gets better and better!  Saw the movie and the first book filled in some of the gaps.  The second and the third book ... I can't wait until the movies come out!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like twitter and this app is easy to use and helpful. Easy to keep up with things in life
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Slow start but ties up nicely at the end.  Would read another book by this author.....thanks for an engaging story.
1594135851|5.0|Catching Fire was written even better than The Hunger Games, and I absolutely adored this book. My favorite in the series.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is a challenge to both my four year old and the 39 year old. As the levels increase not only is strategy required, speed is as well.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Beautiful human story of a boy with severe deformity and how be begins his journey into the world as a young man.
B000W93CHC|1.0|So bad!  Too many characters with complicated blood lines to Pillars, which I did love.  Moved so slow most of the time that I simply quit reading it.  Too bad such a good author has to write so bad.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This app is confusing might be twc but do not like it much. The weather channel is ok. Good thing it is free
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I've ever read!! Totally worth it!! Suzanne Collins is really a AMAZING writer! Kinda bloody though!! But otherwise BEST!!!!!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|I just love celtic music - it reaches right inside, and keeps on giving! This album is no exception - and I'm very happy I took the plunge and bought it sight unseen.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I have a hard time finding games I like with pleasing graphics, a good story, and enough of a puzzle to keep it fun.  I really enjoyed this game from start to finish, and it was a good long time span. Often I'm done in an hour, but this was about 3-4 all together. Looking forward to the sequel!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 7  year old loves this. Game and gives it 5 stars! She plays it all the time and really likes it a lot.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Fun, action packed movie! Good cast that bring the story new life in a high tech world. Must see it.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|The promos for this looked amazing, so we rented it.  But the actual movie has some weird editing and continuity problems.  Scenes just sort of end, and drop off a cliff somewhere.  Glad we didn't pay money to see it in a theater.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|The Particle at the End of the Universe is extremely well written in terms a layman can comprehend and assimilate.It is timely in this extraordinary moment of particle physics
B0064W652A|5.0|Another must read!!! The artwork is awesome (it's Jim Lee. What do you expect?). The story is really good and long. It had me guessing and I could not put my finger on it. You have to get this one.
B000ITF86E|5.0|This is on of my favorite John Wayne movies.  The actors are reminiscent of the old movies that were written and produced without the sex and cursing so prevalent in today's movies.  John Wayne was an excellent actor.  He is excellent in this movie as well.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I rented this movie for family night and figured it would be old and tired since they've made so many on these.  But we were surprised on how good it was. Def. recommend watching
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The case did not fit my buttons very well and I couldn't use the silent button. Not worth the money. Get an Otterbox instead!
B000PC0U1W|4.0|This is an amazing and weird movie. I would rate it 5/5. The quality is decent, not the best but still good. The audio is horrible. I had my tv all the way up and it still wasn't that loud.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Those was by far my favorite of the trilogy.  How I wish there were more to come! Great jib to the author
B000FC10WU|4.0|Good read.  I do like Agatha Christie and enjoyed this very much. I didn't5 figure out the ending before the end,
B008F9E306|5.0|My order arrived promptly, no delays. It was in brand new condition, I am a huge Ti fan so I listen to this cd everyday. Especially when I'm cleaning up. This is a very good cd:)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The story line keeps you enthralled while the writing style lacks and is a little repetitive. Overall an entertaining read.
B00013BN4S|5.0|I got this album as a gift. No one had ever heard of her and I didn't listen to much C&W at the time. I wasn't expecting much,figured it would go to the Salvation Army. Emmylou blew me away and I've stayed blown away. No collection is complete without this one.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|I learned more from this book than I certainly expected; things I never knew, but thought I knew about.  The book is so well written, engaging while being very informative.  If you want to know more about your food supply, this is the most comprehensive book I've read thus far!!!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works fine use it all the tilme just like most cables you can buy anywhere but a much better price than in a retail store
B009FB3XTA|3.0|I have it on my iPod but I won't be holding on to the cd. I do with my favorites in case something happens and my iPod breaks or has to be reset. It's alright and I'm sure bigger fans of the books/movies will like it.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|It is hard to get to stand up sideways. It is easily moved out of its place. As a cover I do like it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent novel - perhaps a little darker than the movie is being billed as...but a well-written story - hints at domestic violence
B00961ZGQC|5.0|This is one of those songs you can't get out of your head. Well, at least that's the case for me, anyway. I'm loving it so much right now, I've made it into my cell phone's ring tone. To quote from American Bandstand, &#34;it's got a good beat and you can dance to it.&#34;
B002APU580|4.0|I really enjoy love/ chick flicks I  had never seen this movie before.Always heard this movie was excellent, However, It did not meet my expectations.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Very interesting read..I enjoyed it very much  and you can look at things a little different after you read this book.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Everything I love is in this game. I really enjoy building my town and growing it. The energy does run out after &quot;x&quot; amount of actions and you have the option of using real money for more. However, I've never bought anything for this game because I never needed to. Once my energy ran out, I click out of the game and do something else. The timers are not unrealistic and if I come back to the game after a couple of hours, my energy will be full again. (1 energy every 3 minutes- you can do the math). Yes, it's frustrating in the beginning because you start out with very little energy, but as you level, you get more energy to use because you have more upkeep for your town. As of today, I'm at a 50 energy bar. I love this game and I play it several times a day.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Works great! Dropped my active operating temp by 10 degrees and now when I am running very demanding software the CPU hasn't gotten hotter than 175 C while with previous bargain compound it would hover at just below 200 C or shut down if went about 201 C.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|On the positive side, I did get this program to connect to my PS3 so I could stream iMediaShare's channels more easily onto my TV.<br /><br />The down-sides: There was no instruction or \\"how to\\" manual to help with the set-up to the PS3, so I had to do a bit of research before I found out how it worked. In case you were curious, all you need to do is start the app. After that, put down your phone or tablet and search for your device under your music, video, or photo menus on your PS3 xmb. You can browse iMediaShare's content from there.<br /><br />Second, the video quality is not that great when streaming. This could be simply because my internet connection is 3 mbps and two wi-fi devices are involved in the streaming, but the quality is pretty choppy and grainy. When I compare this to direct streaming from my devices, the picture quality is much better. Again, unless I had a faster internet connection, I can't really attribute this to the quality of the program. But I have my suspicions.<br /><br />Third, there is a limited amount of content you can play. iMediaShare has popular free internet \\"channels\\" that they post. Outside of these channels, you can't stream internet content. This was an especially hard blow because I was most interested in streaming The Daily Show, but there is no \\"Daily Show,\\" or \\"Comedy Central\\" channel. Maybe there are ways to add more channels, but absent a manual, good luck finding out how. Again, my suspicion is that it isn't possible.<br /><br />So it does what it says, at least for me (yay!). However, there are enough limitations to make me skeptical of its utility or power.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Great processor, works efficiently, little expensive but considering its the heart of the computer, definitely worth it. Read the other reviews for details.
B007RI56NY|3.0|Good but not the best Train Album. But a must have for Train fans who forgive them for the commercialized direction.
B001E45XT4|2.0|I'm not an expert in headphones or anything, but the sound was nice and it produced good quality through the mic.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they aren't that comfortable as the padding around the ear pieces looks thick but there is hard plastic underneath that hurts your ears after maybe around an hour of wearing them.<br /><br />In addition to this, they broke in under 2 years. I opened them somewhat wide (much less than I would've expected would cause any stress on them) and the plastic just under the head cushioning snapped in half.<br /><br />Might try some crazy glue, but either way, not the best product around.
B000MAH5O2|5.0|Must have. You will benefit from reading these fine writings. I learned a lot and was inspired by the encouragement and message of Hope.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I did not see this movie when it was in the Theatre so I purchased the Blu-ray. This a great movie with a good plot and a lot of action. I would recommend this to anyone that likes action movies.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it it has study plans and all sorts of things. I read the Bible nearly every day now. I give it 5 stars!
0345803507|3.0|Big hype but just ok.  Weak characters and no suspense at all!  This is a book for the bored sexaholic:)
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Our 3 year only (in to Disney Princess industry in a big way) lost interest in this story after 10 minutes. To be honest so did I. The plot was a little hard to grasp for tots and unfortunately the state of the art graphics and animation did not make up for the less than perfect script and story. Not worth the price of the rental for us.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am addicted to these episodes. I know someone who got to see the third season (she has a connection) - and she said the third season is even better than the second. What a class act - a beautifully produced series.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not your ordinary S King read. If you usually don't like horror and  think of King that way, then reconsider and try this one. For those who enjoy a good time travel story this hits the spot.i totally enjoyed this book.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|so great to spread the joy and watch it grow over the map!  very intriging, with the various ways to get it to travel. really loved this and have shared it with friends. such fun!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Lots of gold to grind but it's really fun . I've been playing g for two. Months and that is generous considering my short attention span!
0345803493|3.0|Big hype but just ok.  Weak characters and no suspense at all!  This is a book for the bored sexaholic:)
B007UWBQEU|4.0|Great! Love the production here... Worth the download.... so much passion in her voice ...I was blown away and thats the truth
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Awesome!!!!!!!!!! Greatest experience I've seen in a graphic novel in years truly a masterpiece. Love every bit of it. Breathtaking!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Where books intersect with technology. Typography, old and new, a mystery and adventure. A 50-something graphic designer who loves to read and i thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|I purchase this item because it's small and<br />a fit right into your pocket no worries of wires very convenient I love this item.
B00770KR7W|4.0|A very good looking toy and decoration for any fan of the video game who can't afford to shell out 5 times the amount for a higher quality model. The pose-ability of the toy is semi-limited but it still would make a fantastic toy for a child who might be a little older as the structure of the hands feel a little weak. For those like me who love the video game and just want an amazing looking desk ornament this product certainly fits the bill in price and style.
0345803485|3.0|Big hype but just ok.  Weak characters and no suspense at all!  This is a book for the bored sexaholic:)
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Only problem on hardest level I'm almost done. Wish it was a bit more challenging. Other than that I haven't stopped playing it since I purchased.
159562015X|2.0|The book actually needs a code to access the online quiz. The book actually says DO NOT PURCHASE this book if used. This information was not displayed in the description. The company did ship the book fast and did offer to refund the book but for the cost of shipping back, it's not worth my money or time. I just went to local book store to purchase a NEW one. This review is for rating the product and I wanted all buyers to beware of this book.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love this movie! The music sound is so nice , I just don't like to see too much vomit.....
1481251880|5.0|Hoover created a truly amazing novel about coming to terms with demons Sky didn't even know she had. I laughed, cried and loved that I felt that the book came full circle by the end of the book. Thank you for tying up all the loose ends. Sky is an incredibly resilient character who deserves the attention Hoover gives her through this book.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I think this is probably one of the best, and quickest, workouts I've ever done. It's definitely tough, though maybe not for people who are in really good shape, and it definitely changes the shape of your body. Whether or not you lose a lot of pounds, you can definitely fit into clothes differently. It's great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very intriguing. Left me hanging at the ! Going to buy the next book soon! Love the movie too!<br />:D
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|All I can say is thank you to Colleen Hoover for writing a perfect page turning story of love, anger, trust, and hope. You have  gained a forever fan.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|good book recommended from the therapist. seems to be part good info and part bs. must pick and choose what is right for your situation. overall a good read though.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I love moose!!!!!!! He is amazing ! The movie quality is great ! I recommend to everyone to see this movie!
B000FC12C8|3.0|It's good but i've expected more, need more about investements, not only in Wall street. Maybe should be updated till today's market
030746363X|5.0|I really liked this book. Of course, Mr. Ferriss is highly entertaining, but that's not why I liked it so much. I placed my diet -shy husband on the eating program. He liked it!! He lost 20 lbs in about 5 weeks. He REALLY liked that!! He has kept it off for a year- you know he's happy. And he's 58, not 38.But, the best of all was my husband's yearly check-up with the Dr. His AIC dropped from 7.1 to 6.4,FBS 98. I don't have the lab report here, but I know the Dr. was overjoyed with his LDL, HDL, and Trigs. He said his balance is now 'perfect'. None of this was promised by the book, of course.I'm sure it works differently for some.We're happy campers for sure! Thanks, Tim. Linda S. Blyth
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The Best Yet. I hope that this show never ends and that they keep C astiel in the show. Love him!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I was a little disappointed with this movie.It seemed lacking in lots of areas.The graphics were very good though.So So
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Good purchase on my part! A very big thank you to Amazon for providing such good quality products for us consumers.
B008VBYN80|3.0|Its a fun game but any unit you put in the defense  fortress you can't git out unless you tern on gameloft live and when you try to sign into it, it doesn't  load fast it loads vary slowly.<br /><br />And diamonds are the lottery is vary hard to win
0446554995|5.0|I FINISH A NOVEL WITH THE DOINGS OF ALOYCIOUS PENDERGAST AND THEN WAIT IMPATIENTLY FOR THE NEXT ONE, WHICH NEVER COMES SOON ENOUGH FOR ME.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Well written, witty and thought provoking.  The serious situation in the book, which you hope to never have to face, is lightened with lots of humor.  I very much enjoyed the book!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|My brother goes Christmas crazy when it comes to decorating and when I found out he hadn't seen the movie I had to get it for him because he is absolutely griswald!
B005LAII0I|4.0|i haven't had time to watch this movie yet so it is not feasible to write a review on it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|there was a horrible story line to these books...all sex. it was ok in the first book but got very repetitive to me
B008XZKSKG|5.0|The remasters of these Genesis albums are awesome! The highlights of it are &#34;A Trick of The Tail&#34; and &#34;Duke&#34;. Both sound terrific and have plenty of high quality audio.
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|love this movie, great quality on amazon, l would recommend it to anyone who likes zombies, but doesn't always need to watch a serious movie
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I thought that the app really challenged my brain in the higher levels with the tricky combinations and the colors
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book, I can't wait for the movie to come out. It's very entertaining and if you liked the hunger games both the book and the movie you will like this!!!!
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|I liked that this movie was based on a true story.It was very touching and made me cry when the little whale didn't make it.<br />I liked how everyone worked together for the good.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|great movie, good price, good quality, good choice of a purchase for me. if you haven't seen this...you should. thank you
B00A8KJK7G|1.0|I am so dissatisified with this movie, I turned it off.  When the kids started gathering up dead animals and bring them back to life, the cat that was turned into a flying cat/bat, and the rat that looked like a terrifying dinasour. When I hear Disney, I think kid friendly, this, is not.  I have a 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 year old, I would NOT advise anyone with little ones to watch this.  I do take accountability for not making sure the rating was \\"G\\" but really, should I have to do that when it's a Disney movie.  What's Disney going to come come up with next??  Woody and Barbie making adult movies in Barbies play house?? I do not turn off movies, I am that upset by this Disney movie.  I am so glad that my husband advised me to rent before I buy this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome. this game is woo fun. I would totally recommend it to anyone:) this game is worth it get this game now. it works perfectly on my kindle fire I love it;)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story started off slow for me, but I really got into it and ended up loving it. It was to the point that I couldn't put it down. I have read and loved both Slammed and Point of Retreat written by Hoover.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It really was a ride, taking you where ever the story went. Very well written. You could feel the emotions as if they were yours you lived
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think this is the best book in the series. Couldn't put it down. This book kept me on the edge of my seat, loved all the twists.
B004I744AS|5.0|this app has made the use of my system easy and manageable.  Everything. is at my disposal.  thank you.  My reading and defines are sharp and accurate
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This film was very enjoyable a wes anderson classic always fun to watch and bill Murray never disappoints. I will watch again
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My kids are now playing this on my Kindle.  They love it!  And can't get enough of these ticked off feathered friends!
B000FC1KBG|5.0|A very easy read.  Helps get things on track so your baby fits into your life.  Very helpful in understanding baby body language and crying.  Gives all the information you need to get your life back!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is definitely the best Bible app. It has over a dozen translations including NIV, KJV, ESV, and more!<br /> It even has a lot of Bible reading plans.<br />AWESOME!
B0015AARJI|5.0|pretty good vibrates real good, scares me sometimes,i like the new texture of the controller,not so slippery,because when i play i eat,lol
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a major tearjerker at some parts . Also made you think about what could happen to anyone. This book holds so much truth in it that it gets really hard to put down. Definitely recommend it
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I really enjoy watching Robert Carlyle (Mr. Gold/Rumpelstiltskin). His acting is incredible. This show is amazing. I find myself really enjoying each character's story unfold and I look forward to each new episode.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Paltrow's performance really should have gotten her a lot more rewards.  A sleeper of a movie.<br />The music is fine and the music scenes do the music justice.
B005LAIHCM|5.0|You know how some movies preview the good stuff to draw you in & then the movie sux? Well, this movie is NOT like that at all!!  You're on the edge of your seat, cheering for the good guys & booing the bad guys.  I bought Last House on the Left & then this one & I'm thinkin to myself.....I DO NOT WANT TO LIVE ON THIS ROAD!!! lol
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love ebay! The app holds back some functions you get on the regular computer. It still is a great app.
0061780308|5.0|You will just keep driving around till the end, it's that good and well read. It's makes a long drive fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So cool and addicting I just wanted to play it write now so so so so so so so so so so so cool.
B00785P2QC|5.0|virtual city is a life lesson for many people and is fun too and there r many things to learn about
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game takes awhile to rev up but once it gets moving it feels like you've entered into the true game.  Its at its best when you are playing with a friend and tradind point of views.  Stick with it because the beginning levels are almost insultingly .easy
6305546789|5.0|From the first time I saw this, I was hooked.  Of all the &#34;serial killer movies&#34;, this will always be my favorite!!  I have every one of these except for the 3rd one...Season of the Witch. REALLY?!  Stupidest thing EVER!!! Michael ain't even in the movie!!! They should have titled that one different or put it as a separate crappy movie!!
B008FRFN7A|3.0|I expected more from this product. It prints from emails and downloaded documents. I have not figured out how to print directly from the Internet.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|Great book. I couldn't put it down. Erich von Daniken really has been able to answer a lot of questions, and create more with this book.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|this app is cute and funny. all my friend's laugh and thought it was cute. it's a good conversation app to get.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as the hungergame book!  It was easy reading and very interesting.  I hated to put it down!!
B00A9X9VAI|1.0|The story just wasn't there. The movie was more like a collection of scenes put together to fill a set amount of time.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|Holy cow!! This is one of those &#34; Didn't see that coming &#34; movies!!  Scary movies are my favorites..doesn't have to be blood & guts everywhere & this one was the right kind of scary!!
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Super fun, great sound effects and I love that you can change up the appearance if you like. The only draw back is you can't adjust the sensitivity for better game play.
B000YMFCS4|5.0|We saw this movie and it was really well acted and the story line was remarkable.  The scenery as beautiful.
0321543726|5.0|I just love this book. It's entertaining to read and it was written to where each chapter is short and meant to be read in one sitting.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very entertaining.  Good story, even betted graphics.  Plenty of hidden object scenes.  The mini puzzles were entertaining  but easy. Overall a great game..... definitely  worth the money to get the full version.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I did not like this last Resident Evil : Retribution, nothing like the others... Waste of money and waste of time.. It was totally unrealistic, the action just was not there..
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book provides food for thought on many levels--what both animals and humans experience, and the question of reality lived or perceived.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Teriffic movie with great individual performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. The story line evolved overtime going from the role of  the great Roman leader to a slave, and then to a Gladiator.
B000QRIGLC|1.0|A very good read,it was well written,it made me feel very proud of my country and the young men it produces in the am forces.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|great action movie and o.k. story and it had its moments would recommend to friends as i rarely write reviews as you can probably tell.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I can see why this is on the top of the fiction list. Lots of twists and turns. Absolutely recommended.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|This is a handy little mixer for travel and/or small studio setup. I'd bought the 502 first, but inputs turned out to be too limited, and I missed having the EQ. This one's significantly more flexible, and for only slightly more money and travel bulk. It's biggest annoyance for me is, as others have mentioned, the lack of an on/off switch, coupled with the delicate/fiddly connector on the power supply, which makes you not want to unplug it very often. I recommend plugging the unit into some sort of switched power outlet:  I plug mine into a power cable with a foot switch (typically sold for use with Christmas tree lights.)  And for travel, I plug in the power supply verrrry carefully - and bring along a spare (power supply) just in case!  I do wish Behringer would give a little more attention to the powering-it-up side of things, but, lacking that - these are some workarounds.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Again, my grandsons cannot get enough of this game.  i only babysit on Saturday mornings and they can't wait until I get there and hate to see me go.  The downfall is that it takes a lot of battery and if they play for awhile, go to another game and want to come back to this one, there is not enough battery life to load it again.  So...they have to wait until the next weekend :(
B00A6N7BS0|2.0|I really wanted to love this movie. I love Selma & Benecio (sp?)  but Oliver needs to update, I felt like I was watching a softer version of &#34;Natural Born Killers&#34; except I was bored to death. The sex sings were typical, not that I care, and the script wasn't very original... Maybe Oliver's time has come & gone?
B00004XP35|5.0|This is one of my favorites! First time I have ordered an album from Amazon and very happy I did! Gave this to my daughter for Christmas with a &#34;record player&#34;, lol, she is 18 and I don't believe she has ever seen one in action! We had a lot of fun playing this album , (one of her favorites) and it played beautifully. I have been through the 8 tracks, the cassettes, the CD's , but none play as real as a vinyl.
030759565X|4.0|I passed this on to my daughter as it didn't look as inspiring as I had thought.  Hopefully she will feel differently!
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|This season was good, but I feel as though the first season had a bit more in depth characters. more words required.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I (like millions of others) have been a fan of Susan Boyle since her \\"debut\\" on \\"England's Got Talent.\\"  She has only improved since then, & this seems to me her best CD.<br /><br />It was also my introduction to a really great Amazon feature called \\"AutoRip.\\"  What this means is that Amazon will send you the CD, but will also immediately put the MP3 versions into your Amazon Cloud Player!  This is truly Instant Satisfaction!<br /><br />I live in Thailand, and am listening right now to the MP3 version of \\"The Winner Takes It All,\\" downloaded to my PC from the Cloud Player. The CD should be here in a week or two.<br /><br />Brilliant music (thank you, Susan) and brilliant technology (thank you, Amazon).
B005SAJJHM|5.0|This is the funniest show I have ever seen. My wife and I sit and relate the show to people we know.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Good games but kind of long winded. Emotional. Great book. Love the hanging end, can't wait to read the last book!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I figured I would read the book before watching the movie. I am so glad I did. Once you start you won't want to stop.
B007TMON8M|4.0|I played this on my Droid 2 and the screen was too small to allow me to make the fine adjustments necessary.  I think it would be good fun on a tablet.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|I haven't yet seen the movie, but I really loved Chocolat, both the story and the characters. Unlike the author's sequel, which delved more into the issue of witchcraft and magic, Chocolat was only vaguely suggestive of anything supernatural. The characters were charming and sensual, and the story was rich with imagery. The issues between the nonconformist characters living in a socially rigid and conformist French town made for a very interesting story.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It was pretty good, but not as good as I'd heard. Enjoyable nonetheless. Think it would have been better shorter, as the plot got a little silly.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is the best book I HAVE READ. I hope  my grandson reads this one, to show him what a hero is.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I so enjoyed the main charactor who was so creative and clever in starting a new life.  I was rooting for him!
B007TML4EI|3.0|The game play wasn't for me, but the game itself is well designed and functioned well on my Droid 2.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Found my tv easily, pretty easy to use.  Click the video / pic button and the tv auto switches to play it.  Works as advertised.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I bought this because it was a better price than anywhere else.  I was pleased with this purchase and think Adele sings beautifully.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first I was like wow...this is easy. Then it started getting more and more difficult. It's pretty simple and pretty entertaining.
B005USZML4|4.0|This was so real.  I thought I was right there when all the adventures of Theodore was happening.  It took me into another world
B005LAII8A|1.0|Looper as a whole has lots of problems.  First, incorporating time travel into a movie or television is always tricky and Looper has a lot of glaring holes in logic.  Second, Bruce Willis' character is on a mission to kill a mob kingpin when the kingpin is a child.  Because 3 childen were born in the same hospital at the same time, he has to try to kill 3 young children.  I didn't really care for this plot line.  Third, there are quite a few actions scense but there are also large portions of the movie that are fairly slow moving.  I was able to fast forward through many parts of the movie without losing any aspects of the plot - never a good sign.<br /><br />The many stars in this movie are totally wasted.  Emily Blunt provides the best performance.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie before I got interested in the series so I was familiar with with the first book's content. I am looking forward to reading the second and third book's in the series. The plot and characters are well presented and the book held my interest. I finished the last half of the book in an evening because I could not put it down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Book two is an incredible journey. I loved it from page one until the very end. It was quite enjoyable.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|It works exactly as promised for me.  A nice simple straightforward app with a very cool streaming feature.<br />I do not have to log into Facebook; it is obvious you can skip this step; many apps do this.<br />And I don't have to pay; there is a premium version but the free one works just fine for me.<br />Perhaps the instructions could be a little clearer because it looks like either people are having challenges getting it to work, unless there is someone who is deliberately trying to spread misinformation.  I would hope it's the former because that's more correctable.
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|This was just too much everything...Violence, stupid sex, unnecessary discriptions.  I would have liked more of a story that leads me to want to cheer for the heroine
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I found this book in a library review booklet and decided to take a chance on it. Boy am I glad I did. It was one of those  stay up late at night till my eyes won't stay open books. Make sure you have lots of tissues...beautiful story but heart rendering. Will be checking out her other books.
B0064NTZKI|5.0|Woody usually keeps to himself, so it's nice to actually see him talk about his life and his work.  He's one of the greatest directors of all time, so it's very inspiring and revealing as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the whole series and needed to find closure to the plight of the Mocking Jay. I'll definitely consider any other works by this author.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|This was just a remake of Stallone Dredd.  The star just walked around looking tuff and did not have any dialogue.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Very uplifting and happy. A sickens classic that should be read by every person to appreciate the important things in life.
B003H9MSPG|1.0|I give this toy 1 star because. It only lasted for about 30 minuets of playxuntil the cocking mechanism broke. I tried to just fix it by unjamming it until it never moved again
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It was a good book and kept you moving. Characters were interesting. This is my second Jodi Picoult book and I like her very much.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book should be mandatory for every doctor, med student, nutritionist, oncologist and parent...in fact everyone needs to get this detailed information.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Nice straight story, quick read and I love the character. I am reading all of the books now. I am a gal and there are details of guns and stuff but I LOVE it. Totally recommend it. I found out that my husbands grandmother even reads these! So cool, never would have guessed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love, love,love,love this game so much,I could give every game like this 5 stars.cool cool cool cool I love it
B00992CF6W|5.0|what i want to know is that can u join other people with minecraft in ipads and iphones and ipods
B008GXHOFW|3.0|Ok so everyone who's reading the comments that say they watch the intro and the app closes, yes, it does close up, but if you wait a while (a day at the most) it will work. Its kinda corny but overall its ok
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great love story. Great twists towards the end... Good plot, easy read, keeps you wanting more. All around great book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|What a fun and challenging game. Interesting story and puzzles. A great game but does not take too long to finish.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This app is amazing now when I need to access my file I can do it from my computer. I love it!
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|A dark film with a bright ending. Good action and a surprisingly great story. I highly recommend watching this movie.
B007FXLZ9K|5.0|Why Michael Fassbender didn't get an Oscar nomination for this is beyond me.  His performance in this film was phenomenal.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|I thought it was good, I bought it and then realized the Kindle came with a camera :P But I still use it to make videos so it's not a waste.
B0000042MY|5.0|This of course, has become a classic movie.  Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing in all his roles but this one was spectacular.  The musical score really helped make the movie as well.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. I especially like the arcade mode in that if there are no more moves you get a new set of jewels. This game is very fun and a go to when I just want to play.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent from start to finish. As with any book, the first included way more than the movie could show. All three books are contained in a single icon and you can navigate from a small menu. I would recommend buying it if you liked the movie or like to read in general. I couldn't stop reading until I finished the whole thing.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this game is AWESOME good graphics good campain and a great multiplayer. i dont think ther is a better game out there right now
B00005JMAH|5.0|The Harry Potter series in movie form all closely follow the books and are for the most part well done.  The last three are particularly 'dark' both visually and metaphorically.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Enjoyable and fun. Finding love when not really looking! Easy read, enjoyable story, fun characters. Easy to imagine oneself out with friends, joking around, then finding someone so unexpected
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This is a great game for adults and kids, it teaches simple combinations like water + fire = steam and complex ones like shell + stone = limestone. And to everyone who says &quot; their 9 year old kid saw the word sex and got traumatized &quot;, deal with it, your the ones who let their kids play an app with the illuminati symbol on it  in the first place!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am not a big reader but this kept my interest throughout. Kind of reminds me of 1984 where big brother is watching you.
B00003CXI1|5.0|The Harry Potter series in movie form all closely follow the books and are for the most part well done.  The last three are particularly 'dark' both visually and metaphorically.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book along with the two before it were so hard to put down. It real keeps you on your toes guessing and guessing what's going to happen next. I would recommend this series to any and all females in need of a good mine blowing book.

B00ATPVA78|2.0|I played only the &quot;free&quot; part. The game has glitches,  and does not always respond as it should. Needs more work to become a good point-and-click game. The mini-puzzles need better explanations,  and they don't respond correctly. Will not purchase it in its present state.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I was a little turned off of rebuild by 1.11 because it was pretty much just a pretty-looking rehash of the TV series, however 2.22 goes in a pretty awesome direction.<br /><br />If you like Eva, which you should already know or not if you do, definitely worth it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was an amazing read. The way it touched on the life of this kid was amazing. I am recommending it to everyone.
0316224588|2.0|This was the first Rebus book I have read.  It will be the last.  The characters are depressing, the plot too meandering, ending when the author got tired of writing and tacked on a finale.<br />If you liked Rebus before, you may understand what is going on.  To me, he was too old, too depressed and unable to work with anyone else because the other characters were lazy, incompetent or just didn't like him.  It's amazing that any police work gets done with officers like these.  Rebus and the author are too world weary to be solving crimes.<br />Also, the police jargon and British idioms in this book make the descriptions and dialogue uncomfortable, like shoes that don't quite fit.
B004TI5N38|2.0|This book is full of interesting facts and information to give factual detail to all that is happening.  It is evident a lot of research and work went into writing this book.  Baldacci is one of my favorite authors but in this book his choice of victims and villains of which you don't fully know  until the last 10% of the book is so poor , that I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time in reading this book.<br /><br />If your looking for a good read with a feel good feeling after you read it, this is not the book I would choose.
B00000G3PA|3.0|One of the best movies made in my opinion, action, love, thrilling, all in one, Bruce Willis is great, Liv Tyler wonderful . Loved all of the songs, including I'm leaving on a Jet Plane.
B00005QB42|5.0|Wonderful CD and. a perfectly smooth transaction from start to finish. This music is so calm and peaceful!  I listen to it morning, noon and evening. Thank you!
B009JZVT70|5.0|If you haven't seen &#34;Once Upon a Time&#34;, you're missing out on one of the most inventive shows on television. From Snow White and Prince Charming to Captain Hook and soon to be seen Ariel... you'll be amazed how the series creators interweave storybook characters into the show.
B000VEA38E|5.0|Got this for my 8 year old son to listen to while he plays with legos.  He loves it!  It is fun to enjoy this together.
B000W745CU|5.0|thanks for the movie. it was well shipped! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Works as advertised! Took only seconds to see my photos on TV, using my Kindle as a remote. Amazing App. Can I have my flying car next, please?
B006LSZECO|5.0|I presented this author and book as a moderator for my book club.  So many twists & turns, I could not put it down.  Loved it!
B00914JWSW|5.0|I loved everything about this CD.  I've been a fan of hers since 1972, and it had never occurred to me until this &#34;album&#34; that there would be so many recordings that were done, but were never released.  With an artist of Barbra's caliber, one can only imagine how many extraodinary recordings are sitting in a vault somewhere.  Some of the best were compiled into this release.  Everything was assembled with such care - the recordings, the photos, the notes.  Exquisite perfection. I would expect nothing less.
B008U5RVUY|5.0|It is almost too easy, in a setting where many outstanding boxsets have been offered by the major record companies over the last couple of years, to feel unimpressed by DG's new Mozart 111.<br />The packaging follows into the footsteps of its two predecessors: original album front covers, back with minimal track information, a basic soft cover book with a succinct introduction,  all at a terrific price. I prefer the glossy covers (which also included original back cover art) and vinyl-styled CDs of the Karajan 60 boxset, but the value of the 111-series is of course amazing. The only difference between this and the two previous sets is that the present edition features a single composer. Is a Beethoven edition in the works for next year?<br /><br />With no less than nine albums featuring Wiener Philharmoniker and almost as many with the BPO, there is a strong prestigious old world orchestra presence in the set, but the mix is appropriate nonetheless with three Trevor Pinnock, one Minkowski and his Musiciens du Louvre and one Gardiner.<br />There is somewhat of an effort to represent the different decades that have made Deutsche Grammophon one of the handful most celebrated classical music recording houses, but the focus is definitely on the seventies and beyond with the digital age. There are fifteen albums from the eighties (some are double CD albums), the best-represented decade, and the oldest recording of the set is String Quintets K516 & K593 performed by the Amadeus Quartet in 1957 (CD 25, with also some of the best cover art of the set).<br /><br />As expected from such a set, the offering is interspersed with significant recordings. The magistral 1964 Majic Flute under the baton of Karl Bohm and with the great Fritz Wunderlich. The well-noted James Levine's 1989 Cosi Fan Tutte. The thrilling Gulda Mozart tapes. Bernstein's Great Mass in C minor, recorded just six months before his death, to name a few. And note that these recordings alone, probably still available, would almost pay for the entire 111 set if purchased separately.<br /><br />My favorite so far is Marc Minkowski's Les Musiciens du Louvre rendition of the symphonies No. 40 & 41 (CD 5), which captures with great clarity, freshness and balance the finesse of these late symphonies. While the tempos, as in the opening movement of the symphonie No. 40, really took me by surprise, this very confident interpretation truly made me listen to these two symphonies as if it was the first time. A rare and absolute treat, and ultimately the kind of experience I always hope to find in such a boxset.<br /><br />There could have been more of a focus on rare recordings from the fifties and sixties. But the goal of this type of set, which is to enable new and existing classical music lovers to discover at a very reasonable price new music and new interpretations of their favorite recordings, and to be taken occasionally to new heights in the process - I believe this goal has been attained.lable, would almost pay for the entire 111 set if purchased separately.<br /><br />My favorite so far is Marc Minkowski's Les Musiciens du Louvre rendition of the symphonies No. 40 & 41 (CD 5), which captures with great clarity, freshness and balance the finesse of these late symphonies.

B0001HLVSC|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband and he and I both enjoyed this film very much. Great story, great acting.
B00846REIS|5.0|I can't wait for the third book.  Like everyone else I wish I didn't have to wait until May for the last book.  Would highly recommend this trilogy.  I'm now re-reading these two books for the third time.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|The trailers were way more scary and interesting than the actual show. Definitely not as good as first season, but I'm invested and now hooked.  There are just flirts with evil and aliens, but there is no substance behind it. It's a surface level story. Love Jessica Lang and the guy who plays Kit.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook in the first place and now I can get it on my kindle fire<br />I mostly message on facebook
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Awesome game!  Love the free level, and how it unlocks levels as you play the game!  My husband and boys love the game, too!
0374214913|5.0|It is a joy to read a book that from the very beginning takes you on a pleasant journey.  It is a tale of a geek who gets a job in a very strange bookstore.  Not strange in a malevolent way, but peculiar.  There are three rules: always be there on time, take detailed notes about the people who come by (what did they take, what did they return, what were they wearing, what was their demeanor), and do not read the books.  These books are not for sale, by the way.  They are only for members of the society.<br /><br />At a few points, as I finished a chapter and either had to get to sleep or go back up to my office (having taken refuge in Mr Penumbra's bookstore during lunch), I thought that the book had reached a plateau and I thought I knew what was or was not going to happen next.  Then when I next picked up the book, the journey had moved on in a new direction.<br /><br />I was enchanted throughout and look forward to Robin Sloan's next project.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I am a PP fan based on his performances on AI. I knew he was special and knew that his album would be great, but wowoowowowoww....so much more! To me, a huge DMB fan, he's got similar style, but yet unequally PP and I love it!!!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Most sequels and 3 and 4th movies are usually terrible in comparison to the original, but Ice Age has made 4 great movies. A must see!
B0041KVW2K|4.0|This boxed set is very good. Also in my collection is the MFSL Beatles Collection boxed set, from 1982. The rating on the 2012 vinyl from Rainbo is 4 out of 5 stars. My set was pressed by Rainbo Records in Hollywood. There were a couple of minor cosmetic issues with the LP's, such as labels not cleanly punched, and a couple of tracks that had to be played several times to \\"polish\\" the grooves. The sound quality is better (warmer) than the 2009 CD's. And the sound is also a bit warmer than my Mofi set of LP's. The vinyl on this set is mostly dead quiet, almost CD like. There have been many customers of this boxed set that have had to return some of the LP's to EMI for replacement due to defects. I will not be returning any of these, and they are now my go to source for listening to The Beatles on vinyl!
B000I3W1XS|5.0|This movie definitely holds up over time.  I was surprised how much my wife and I enjoyed it.  Worth the watch!
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I was hooked from the very beginning. The show is original, sexy, with the perfect touch of horror.  If you're a fan of the \\"Vampire Diaries\\" or the \\"Twilight\\" Saga, this is not for you. Exit the \\"romantic\\" vision of vampires as twisted poets looking for true love. This is brutal and realistic, in the same line that \\"Being Human\\".<br /><br />Ana Paquin, along with Alexander Skarsgard, gives an incredible performance. A must see.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book both told many stories while building multiple story lines. At one point the book seems to stagnate,  and reading became almost painful. Then the story picked up again. Because the plots and subplots became so intriguing, I gave it a higher rating than I felt it initially warranted. I am anticipating more intrigue in the books to follow.
B0058BI896|5.0|I love this show! This show is great!!!! I'm happy I can buy it in instant video I never have time to watch it on cable so I'm very happy with this
B005FQE2E4|1.0|Did not enjoy this book at all.  Perhaps my sense of humor was on vacation.  I have read similar books and enjoyed them very much, but not this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is a wonderful game. it is so fast paced.people get this game if u dont have it now!
B009L7MD44|5.0|Works like a charm and has good features. This product will evolve over time to become the best.<br /><br />Does not work in wifi environments that require a user I'd and password or in public locations that required to accept a license
B0079R8KO0|4.0|Fits good. Stay in place, even if dropped. Speakers are not covered by tabs that hold cover in place. Easily removed if needed.
B00B37ET42|5.0|This novel is essentially about what you do with yourself when you don't know what to do with yourself. Like much of Fitzgerald it explores its theme through marital intimacies and intergenerational differences. This was Fitzgerald's second novel and has been sometimes been overlooked. However this new edition brings it back to life. This is a must for every serious reader's bookshelf.
B005LAII80|5.0|I was expecting this movie to be a little flaky but it wasnt.  It was really good.  I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it.  The mama character is played by lena headey, she also played sarah conner in terminator sarah conner chronicles.  She did great in this movie.  Karl Urban is the guy that played bones in star trek 2009.  Did a great job too.  Highlly recommend this one.
B009JZTOG8|1.0|It's not the show that I don't like, it's the fact that I bought it and now it won't load, I can watch other videos on my smart TV, but every time I try to watch this one it tries to load for 10 minutes and then comes up with an error reading.  I am frustrated because I can't figure out how to report this or fix it.
B002U3CB5M|5.0|beautiful book full of mystery and love with an interesting storyline. a gorgeous read- would love to be starting it all over again
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Wow! This book was amazing! Rick Riordan continues to astonish his readers with his creative mind. I've read all 3 in books in the Heroes of Olympus series, an I couldn't put anyone of them down! I'm an 8th grader and I think these books are fantastic. I can't wait until the next book of this series comes out. I'm going to buy it right away!
B009MO5960|4.0|It was a good movie and i'm a fan of the series but it could have been a lot better.  I would rent it before buying it just in case you dont like it.  It wasn't horrible but the story was little confusing.  They also showed leon in the movie but they didnt really give him much of a introduction or a role in this series with alice so it was kind weird for him to just pop in.  He dressed well for the part but his acting wasnt that great.  It seemed like this movie was a little rush and wasnt directed to well.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I purchased a new bluray player for my in-laws for Christmeas and we decided to give them this movie to start their bluray collection. They said they enjoyed the movie and really like the great visuals that only the bluray experience can give.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|enjoy the series but this one was  not as enjoyable as some of the other book. a a a a
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't explain how much this book meant to me, it will always hold a close spot near my heart. My heart broke so many times reading this book but thankfully by the end of the book I was able to piece it back together. Thank you for writing this book. I live it!!!
B009MF56GC|5.0|Loved it. Great action movie like the first one.  Favorite part is when chuck norris comes in and take out everything by himself and then they make the chuck norris joke.  Hillarious.  They should have made the movie a little bit longer but oh well. It was still good.
B000PC0U1W|3.0|I have been updating our movie collection with blurays of DVDs that we like to watch more often. I was a bit disappointed with this title because it does not come across as that big of an improvement over the regular DVD.
B009OYTIXS|4.0|21st century take on the Green Arrow comic I read as a kid. Entertaining show, great comic-book fights, dark, confused, and conflicted characters, and none more so than the well-intentioned sociopathic lead who claims great moral clarity for himself. Episode 4 is a great example of the mishmash of modern morality reflected in the cast of characters - the casual taking of human life, killing a bird for food as the first step toward becoming a killer of men, death for the blue-collar bad guy, arrest and trial for the white-collar bad guy, the attraction of vigilante justice over the rule of law, mother as monster, etc. I'll keep watching to see how the network and the writers work all this out in order to keep the show's audience happy and engaged.
B003YL4L0W|1.0|Terrible.  Poorly drawn and impossible to believe wooden characters.  Plot twists and lost of threads are distracting.  The obvious politically correct conclusion marks this as a hack job written just as propaganda.  Ms Picoult's failings are reminiscent of Mr. Grishams fall into preaching instead of writing.  I wish I could get my money back on this one!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Great book, a real page tuner.  Can not wait to read the next in the series. I am becoming a real fan of Jack.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|If you havent experienced this movie yet then you are truly in for a real treat. Bluray is equally as striking as the theatre experience. I just wish this had a real iTunes copy as this Ultra-Violet format is absolutely a joke. I will not consider an UV copy in my purchase decision ever again and will just settle to purchase the iTunes copy out of the gate.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I had been playing the game for about three months, had gotten to level forty, had over a hundred gameloft friends. and the game inexplicably restarted from the very beginning. all of my progress (and money invested) lost I contacted gameloft a while ago.  . . no response yet. Definetly not cool.
B004UBM4TA|4.0|Great movie but I just picked it up for 20 dollars at Best Buy. Why is it almost $90 here? Crazy!
B009R8DJ72|5.0|This is the greatest series ever! Jeff Kinney is an original!  This is the first set of books of this nature that my children have ever read.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I was pleasantly surprised with the content of this rental. I was not expecting to be enetrtained to the level that the move delivers. I like the modern update of the original movie. The movie has more of a Blade Runner feel this time and the digital enhanceents are very well done with a bit of an I-Robot feel. However the delivery of the actual playback leaft alot to be deisred. First off I was disappointed that the movie was not in HD and believe me that is never noticable as this movie has very compkex images that the streaming process was struggling with. I have watched other movies from Amazon with similar content and they were visually appealing. I will probably contact Amazon about this rental as I feel it was really not a good value.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|I cannot get enough of Shaun the Sheep and enjoy watching these all the time! There is something incredibly witty and charming about all the episodes. I wish they were producing more seasons.
B0079J28NC|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter and she loved it. With it being restored made for a very enjoyable movie. The Beatles are timeless.
B0018J2QB8|2.0|Don't get me wrong. I know this is a very popular show with a very unique premise. I have just tried to get into Dexter two or three times and always get a really sick feeling inside. I don't think I will watch again.
B003W5C0VC|4.0|This was a replacement to my DVD of the same title and while it is a bit better I am not sure it is that much better. As for content if you have not seen this movie and are expecting the same poor performances of Manhunter you will be pleasantly surprised to see this story with an outstanding cast.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|The movie was very good and the actors and plot was good. They could put in a better ending. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game has so many games in it it will be like you wont stop running out of games to play and it is so fun you wont want to.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It's small but very efficient tool. If you have some knife, it is the tool to make them sharp in a minute.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I have been a big fan of Indiana Jones since I was a teenager and this bluray upgrade really makes these movies a leasure to watch again. The playback even on the original movie is outstanding.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Granddaughter loved it. Very durable. Thought it would be cardboard. Turned out to be vinyl. Big enough to store several barbies and accessories. Would purchase again for other granddaughters.
B005QUQP76|4.0|I love this mouse, it works great with BF3 and Boarderlands 2. It is also a good mouse for everyday surfing online. The only reason I took 1 star away is because the Sniper button is placed in a awkward spot. If you a trying to use it in game , you have to stretch to hit the button which will throw your aim off trying to press and hold the button. If they fix the Sniper button position they have a 5 star mouse on their hands.
B001CNFZEK|5.0|IMO, his first three were his best. After this one, Santana started drifting away away from his latin sound. This cd set is a good choice because it has the album cd and a live performance cd. It also includes a few bonus tracks. Sony has done a great job remastering the album (hence Legacy Edition) and it does sound very good. Detail and clarity that almost rivals a sacd.
B004XKVPG6|5.0|This was a bluray replacement for a very old VHS tape that I never bothered to get on DVD. I am glad I waited as this movie is a great night of entertainment even if you have to leave the lights on.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Awesome series. I am a huge fan. The dvds were in great condition. I would recommend this show to anyone!
B005LAJ212|5.0|Was given as a gift. Do not know if the person has used it or not. Will repost if I hear
1451695195|5.0|If you know any doubters who question the existence of God, this book lays out some scientific facts that are proven and unquestionable so as to leave no cracks for 'honest' doubters to slide through and ridicule.  I purchased several for family and friends who have recently lost loved ones.  Very much appreciated by all!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|nice casual type game. a decent build as you go. combat is easy though unrealistic. it is was it is designed to be...fun
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I love this show. The dvds came in great condition. Anyone who watches one episode will get hooked on the series.

B008OOYALE|5.0|Awesome time playing this game. I do enjoy it just need neighbors. So if you decide to play please add me techtiff22. It will be fun. Oh I love the fact you get to name your dragons. Watching them grow and evolve is just a bonus.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The entire season was great with unexpected twists and turns around every staircase.  Wonderful drama, fantastic costumes and beautiful settings.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci does it again...Great read with people you can relate too..and again..the govt. sucks!! I will  encourage others to read it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is a book of bloodlust, with all the nuances that a fine chess player can weave into a storyline.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very fun game and a great way to pass the time. the energy bar is limiting because every task drains your energy supply and when you are out,  you have to wait 2 minutes for more. otherwise it is great fun.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I love Alicia's voice and the songs have messages in them that help to promote womans strength. I don't like Alicia's political views, how can you like a president that puts people out of work and tries to take the USA down?!
B0042RUMJG|4.0|Another great DVD,,,Great sight and sound, He plays his heart ouit!!! Totally enjoying it.<br />Thaat's all I have to say.
B008OP32M6|5.0|First impressions are important, right?  Well, I opened the box and it's only half full.  The box could have been much smaller, but if it had the presentation wouldn't have been the same.<br /><br />I took out the bags and separated them in to bags labeled \\"1\\" and bags labeled \\"2.\\"  I then set to work by opening bags labeled \\"1\\" and spread them across my table then organized them by color and type.<br /><br />Now, I enjoyed every second of putting this intricate structure together.  I love taking four seemingly useless parts and putting them together and finding that they are actually part of a much bigger picture.  After making the differential I st there and messed with the moving gears for a few minutes.  I like making things move.  I probably took 30 pictures of the construction process.  I am very impressed by a lot of the functions.  With that said, I think that the visual details on the outside are lacking.  Also, I think the need for using stickers is kind of tacky, especially for the price.<br /><br />I did enjoy putting every part of this crawler.  I loved putting the differentials together.  I was excited when I finally got to put the motors in.  The best part was when I finally had batteries.  I was disappointed when I got the batteries in the remote and the truck didn't move. Then my husband snickered and told me to check the channel on the remote.<br /><br />Now, back to the power functions.  I don't know what I really expected, but I don't think I actually expected it to CRAWL.  That's okay. As I understand it, this was a user-made structure that Lego chose to produce.  Most of the power functions are used in construction vehicles and they are perfect for that.  Maybe I will put this crawler on tracks instead of tires.<br /><br />I think the cost is pretty outrageous for what you're getting.  Normally, you can assume that, on average, 50 pieces for cost $5.  That would put you at ~$140. The add the $30 power functions set.  I don't know about you, but that doesn't add up to the current price of $200.  I am really curious as to why it cost so much when the majority of these pieces are tiny.that doesn't add up to the current price of $200.

B005EWDA9M|5.0|It's interesting from page 1 and I like how the story unfolds in a quite subtle way that slowly but surely makes sure that putting the book down will be difficult once you've started reading.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This is a great movie with an even better message. I'm glad there are good, clean movies available that teach a moral/lesson.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|This item has been given a heck of a workout!!  Our grandsons love LEGOS and enjoy building things with them.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all of the Fifty Shades books but this is my favorite. Worth the money -- you won't be disappointed!
1848775873|5.0|Short, but very sweet and good book. Shaun Tan always has great art work and lessons to be learned in his writing.
0345803507|5.0|I really enjoyed reading these books. The third one was good and I was sad for it to end. I recommened these to my mom and she is enjoying them now too.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It was a great movie with funny moments and a story line that keep moving at a brisk pace to that will keep you entertained.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you read the first one, you have to read this one. Very interesting with no boring parts. Worth the money!
B005OCFGTO|1.0|I do not know if my collection is different than that of the people who liked this product, but this version is very poor. It skips, despite no visible damage, goes black, splits on the screen randomly, and has grainy quality. I could not believe I payed for it and I will be returning it as soon as I can.<br /><br />Updated Review:<br /><br />I tried this collection in a different DVD player than my own and they worked just fine. The films themselves are fun, the case is still poor, however, I decided not to return it after all because the problem is our old DVD player not the set and we sometimes lend them out.
1612680011|5.0|This book taught me that value of a dollar and made me realize as a kid growing up in a low to middle class family, that I really had no idea how to spend money WISELY. I was keeping up with the Jone's and becoming broke in the process. I'm so glad I read this book while still young (I'm a freshman in college). It made me realize I can use the money my parents have given me to pay for college and do so many different things with it. The possibilities are endless! Not that I don't realize that it's risky, but this book has definitely motivated me to save my money rather just spend it frivolously on education and college social living. Instead, I can invest it and maybe be one step ahead of my peers upon graduation!<br /><br />I think people give this book bad reviews sometimes because they realize that a lot of what the author says is much easier to put to action while in your youth rather than when you are older and you've already spent years upon years working and being stuck in the \\"Rat Race\\" of society. It takes a lot of guts to stop live modestly and change the way you handle money. The author himself was able to retire at about 47 and it's all because he started in his 20's!<br /><br />All in all, I think the material in this book is sometimes difficult to digest. It's so simple, so obvious, but still hard to believe. I look at money and my \\"wealthy\\" friends in an entirely different life now and take my middle class friend's advice with a grain of salt. I am recommending this book with two thumbs up. It can be a life-changing read if you open yourself up to what the author has to say and you approach his advice with an open-mind and blank palate. I have to get out of the Rate Race!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not only is this book intense erotica/BDSM; but also, and more importantly, a passionate, indulgent, forget who you are love story. This is a must read if you've ever been in love like that but read with an open mind as at first it is hard to see past the almost insane BDSM.
B008NEVPCC|1.0|Yes, She looks cute and she definitely has swag but from the very first X Factor audition to be honest vocally, I don't think that her voice has much standing power and if it does then this album doesn't show off her talents. It's filled with auto tone, special sound effects and electronic beats that are meant to replace instruments. This cannot be. I have listened to every song on the album and so far I can tell you that although the producers has taken the effort to vocally arrange it and adjust it in the studios I have heard people singing on Youtube with nothing but a guitar to back their voices up and it has wowed me a million times more.<br /><br />This Album is for me awful, and a waste of time. It doesn't forecast any talent, any message, any beautiful sounding harmonies. The Lyrics are cliche and childish that if I hadn't known any better I would say they were written in five minutes max. The songs themselves are recycled everything about them the tunes, the melodies, the beats. It didn't take me long before I thought to myself where have I heard this before? In a dozen previous songs/hits of course!<br /><br />I understand She clearly has a large base of fans that will buy her albums and she has an album out which is an accomplishment for a 19 year old who didn't make it to the top 3 finals in the X factor you can't deny that. However, I want more than just grinning and uttering words that are so overused in the pop industry nowadays. It takes more than that to make a good impression and leave your footsteps in the music industry.<br /><br />Sooner or Later, if Cher keeps moving into this direction she'll disappear without a trace and no one will ever remember this album and how could they? There's a million other artists who publish the same genra/formula of songs into the public everyday. Her work is not unique so her efforts and talents if they existed will go down the drain I'm afraid.<br /><br />I Know I'm being Harsh but I just want to be honest here. Let's face it Cher is not going to be the next Pop star.. Let's face it Cher is not going to be the next Pop star.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|This is one of those albums that I can't wait for it to end so I can start it over again! I've been a long time fan and I really enjoyed Diamond Eyes but this one blew me back to Fur and Pony. If you are a long time fan you've already got it. If you are thinking about it, stop thinking and buy it. You will not be disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun and pretty realistic! i love this game and would recommend it to anyone! five stars!
B005LAII6C|5.0|This is a great movie, May not be for everyone but it is a movie that I think a lot of people will enjoy.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|After the success of the movie I decided to give the book a try, but the experience was completely disappointing so I returned it immediately. There´s an abyss between this book and good writing (person, style, adjectives, sentences structure, etc.).  Finally, the fact that the kindle version is poorly formatted doesn´t help either.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|My whole family really enjoyed this movie. It would be so interesting to see how the storyline would go if written as a \\"grown-up\\" scary movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Read this book in 3 days, love it!  It is so well written and a storyline like no other book I ever read.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|There can only be one batman.  It has to be Christian Bale he does a masterful job in this picture. I really  enjoyed this movie. The camera angles were just great. This was just a wonderful movie.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've played this game on my PC and love it.  I was so happy to be able get it on my Kindle Fire HD.
030758836X|5.0|This is the second book I've read by this author, and she is incredible!  She must be twisted in the head to even come up with this stuff, but it is a delightful read.  I keep trying to solve the mystery, and every time I think I may have an idea, the author makes another twist and I am baffled again.  The twists carry the reader through the book, and even the end twists and turns as the truth is revealed.  Unlike many books, the end doesn't offer full closure, but instead a really creepy feeling.  I love this author's books!
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I have read some of the reviews and i don't understand why some people can't see the option to skip the Facebook login. This app works great with my Galaxy Nexus and Vizio Co-Star Google TV,it would be nice if it was compatible with more Google TV devices, but all in all it's a great app.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|This is an assessment that actually spurred growth in my life because it went beyond the theoretical and actually gave practical suggestions.  I'm glad I decided to get the kindle edition because the real benefit of the book to me is the actual assessment. So I can have both with out taking space from my bookshelf.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game and brain stimulator  Ive gone through both Quells several times and am ready for another set  Idont knowhow itcan get any  harder but rBring it onfolks!
0375842209|5.0|I laughed and I cried.  I learned a tiny amount of history.<br /><br />The only thing I would change is the very beginning, as the narrative introduces himself.  It is too weird.  It almost made me put the book down and determine it wasn't my style, but luckily the narrator begins focusing on the really interesting stories, and it becomes difficult to put the book down.<br /><br />My suggestion is to not give up on the book based on the first couple chapters.  You will be forever changed by this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|most games easy to hit target pts.  1 bad thing so far is that some games require you to hold device flat so you can see everything going on.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I downloaded this book and have read it. I very much enjoyed it.thank you for the ability to download and not have to carry a book around
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is my first Stephen King novel and I can assure you it won't be my last! This book was a page turner from the start and my only regret is that it ended! I WILL be reading this again!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|if you're a fan of the show or app games in general you'll like this one.  get the game and fall in love with it
B007L6VR12|5.0|Cool movie. Kinda different. Weird sense of humor needed. Great actors. Funny in a dark way. I enjoyed it very much.
0062014102|4.0|It is a brilliant book and I am enjoying it, but it is sufficiently scientific to require close attention and some effort, so I am reading it in shorter spurts - and loving it because it explains so much about how the universe works and why it seems to work as it does.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I have only been playing a short while, and I like it, but I think the only way I will really progress will be by spending money.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I love Nicholas Sparks he definitely knows how to make you fall in live with the characters and how to break your heart.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a fun game that I play with my nephew on his ipod.  You do not need many options to have so much fun and earning coins and guessing some interesting drawings!  Its even more fun the less artistic skill you have!
B0095T3H2U|4.0|Don't watch this film if you have been  in a relationship forever and are at the crossroads....which is what I did.  Cute chick flick.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|No spoilers...<br /><br />Loved it, loved it, loved it.<br /><br />Okay, what did I love about it? The story was fast paced, and didn't stop until the last page. I loved the evolution of the main characters, and how the story started out nice and slowly, explaining everything in order as it went, building to a crescendo.<br /><br />The writing was smooth, and you forgot you were reading a book - it sucked you in from the beginning. The only reason I stopped reading it at 4.00am in the morning was because the words were going fuzzy on me! (Dang old age!)<br /><br />I haven't found a new favorite author for awhile, but this young lady has definitely ticked all of the right boxes for me. In fact, I've just decided I'm going to create a new shelf in Goodreads called 'Favorites' which will make it easier for me to find and reread. Because I will read this one again.<br /><br />There were only two things I didn't like about this book. One: that it ended, and two: that there isn't another one to read straight away... hmmm, off to Amazon I go! Must search for more of Ms. Swank.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I loved something borrowed, the movie and the book. I liked that this book was from Darcy's side of things.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed the game..its a great time filler..challenges were not too hard and it still was able to be entertaining ...well done...I also liked that I had the choice of logging in under different difficulties to make the challenges either easier or more difficult..I am definitely a fan of G5 games and definitely going to purchase more like this from them..thanx
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great read, couldn't put it down. Loved the writing, every picture was painted perfectly for me, I could see every scene. Great follow-up to the first book. Glad there is one more!
B000W94FE6|4.0|I highly recommend this book as it gives new insight on what it means to do something enjoyable while giving a frame work on how people find flow.  Keep in mind that this is not a self-help book but a more scientific view on the concept of flow. This goes beyond finding flow in daily activity, sports, or hobbies by giving examples of people who have found a life theme that gives meaning to their life as a whole.
B006G2124E|5.0|This movie was very good.  While I enjoyed it, my husband thought it was too long.  It was very informative and I liked the acting.  Would recommend it.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|There were so many plots the dark soap opera had me  on the edge of my seat.  The first season was contained within the house, and all the stories were where people were trying to remove themselves from the  house,<br />While the second  season had great promise and direction I think the aliens was too much<br />Also when Dylan McDermott twittering plot point upset me.<br />The season was disconbonbulated but I will watch again next year

B004SBX112|5.0|Love this game and usually play one of the Angry Birds games daily while waiting for my husband to get off work.  But the only thing is I've played them so much that the games won't let me play any new ones after awhile.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Author Victor Hugo puts the reader IN the places and people he writes about. One can feel the heat, the bloodied lip, and the despair in every scene.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|As a former bookseller I remember when Preston and Child started writing their books; they were so entertaining and captivating.  It then seemed they began to border on the slightly absurd and I stopped reading them for a while but always checked to see the reviews of a new novel.  The excellent reviews of Two Graves persuaded me to read them again.  I'm so glad I did !!<br />This book was very entertaining and hard to put down, filled with action and intrigue, well worth the time spent.  A very good read.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|We all know the PS Vita is a powerhouse, it could eat five 3DS's for breakfast and still have time to lounge around before work. Yet the 3DS continues to outsell it by a vast margin, why? It's not because the Vita's too expensive, it's because of the lack of great games for the system itself.<br /><br />Persona 4 Golden is reason enough alone to drop $250 on a Vita.<br /><br />I don't have a lot of JRPG experience, I've played games like Tales of Vesperia and what not, so I didn't know what to expect when I picked this little gem up for my Vita. I was blown away by how in depth this title was, there's a little bit of a learning curve but the game does such a great job explaining everything you've got the hang of it before you know it. I never thought a video game would make me succumb to peer pressure, but as you live out this hero's daily life you find yourself doing many things. From fighting shadows in a different dimension to building relationships by attending club meetings and sports practices, or even just going to the library to study for your upcoming midterms, this game will hook you by the lip and refuse to let go.<br /><br />I recommend this game to ANYBODY who owns a Vita. Whether you love RPG's or have never even played one.
B000OZHVXA|4.0|Like all Woody Allen movies, this one can be a bit dopey at times.  But, overall a very entertaining flick.  Johansson does a pretty good job of convincing the viewer that she's a dorky college student in pursuit of a big scoop.  Overall great cast and good film for light entertainment.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|I had to wonder what would make this work with a TV. Yes, you need something that connects your TV to the internet. Thankfully I have a PS3.<br />Would I use this every day? No.<br />It is more like a novelty item, but it is cute.<br />Could probably do the same thing with my PS3 with out this application if I wanted to spend more time setting it up, but this does make it pretty easy.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|There are levels I have 3-starred and I don't know what I did (that's pretty much true for all of them, I'm not the greatest physicist or pinball player) and other levels I have worked and worked and never have gotten that second star. When I get too angry at those lousy piggies I go do something else. So there. But I always come back. Always.
1471310388|4.0|Mr. Baker does a fine job of bringing life to the characters. He does read at a brisk pace so I might have a print copy of the story on hand the next time the family listens to it. Good, clear sound. However, while listening to it in the car we almost had it at full volume because Mr. Baker's would read so softly (and quickly) at times we could barely hear him. We haven't listened to it at home so it might be a different experience.

0312330537|5.0|One of best books I have ever read!  This novel is based on the true life adventures of Gregory David Roberts who experienced a life of lawlessness and lived and thrived among the poor in one of Bombay's notorious slums where he established a free medical clinic.  Outside of the slum area, he formed friendships, fell in love, became enmeshed with the Bombay mafia, returned to jail and ultimately returned to Bombay to write and to live.

0525952926|1.0|This is the first time I have submitted comments on a book.  Although finding it somewhat formulaic, I did enjoy the first book of this trilogy and was looking forward to reading the second.  After the first 100 pages or so, I gave up.  The writing is sophomoric;  inane dialogue by shallow characters, formulaic,  predictable, etc.  I'm very interested in this period of history and historical fiction is one of my favorite genres.  Reading this work however is just too frustrating.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I thank God for giving our country these good men. Adam Brown was a very special person. I really love it when you can see God working in our lives. There are many examples in this book. The thunderstorm when Adam needed a day off, & the number 24.  Adam was put here for a reason. Just look at all the people who renewed or came to faith because of Adam.  Great story. Thank you to the Brown Family and Teams for sharing it.

1594487154|5.0|There are many volumes written about sales. There are myriad training courses on sales and how to be efficient, effective and top of the heap at the game of sales. This book is not like any of the ones I have read prior to this nor is Pink espousing any of the usual hype about overcoming objections, how to close and/or how to manipulate folks into buying your product or services.<br />Instead, Pink is proposing something that I have been struggling with for the past five years and suggesting to anyone who would listen: traditional sales isn't any longer anyone's job. It's everyone's job because sales has fundamentally changed. Pink states that \\"Most of what we think we understand about selling is constructed atop a foundation of assumptions that has crumbled.\\"  He further states that sales has changed more in the past 10 years than it had in the previous 100 years.<br /><br />Pink replaces the old standard ABC rule in sales; \\"Always Be Closing\\" with a new ABCs-- Attunement, Buoyancy, and Clarity.  He proceeds to explain what he means by each in the following chapters of the book. Briefly, attunement is bringing oneself into harmony with individuals, groups and contexts. Buoyancy is the quality that combines grittiness of spirit and the sunniness of outlook. It's what allows salespeople to overcome the \\"ocean of rejection\\" they face every day and still function. Clarity is the capacity to make sense of complex situations, that gray area we all try to avoid. Salespeople become problem finders rather than problem solvers.<br /><br />To Sell is Human is broken into three parts: Part 1 is Rebirth of a Salesman, Part 2 is How to Be and Part 3 is What to Do. He develops a new category he introduces as \\"non-sales selling\\" where we (all of us not in the traditional sales position) are \\"persuading, convincing, and influencing others to give up something they've got in exchange for what we've got.\\" i One of the more important changes that Pink underscores is that the salesperson is no longer needed as a curator of information. Sellers are able, if they so choose, to be as well informed about the products and services as the salesperson. He coins the phrase caveat venditor - seller beware.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter in parts 2 and 3 are dozens of techniques assembled from fresh research and best practices around the world. Pink maintains that the ability to move others to exchange what they have for what we have is a crucial ability that is required for our survival and wellbeing. The capacity to \\"sell\\" isn't some unnatural adaptation to the merciless world of commerce. It is a part of who we are.<br /><br />On a personal note, I found this book to be both refreshing and humorous. Refreshing because Pink gave me a way to think about and express what I have been seeing and talking about for a long time now. Specifically that sell is a four-letter-word. More and more people are turned off by traditional sales (even the so-called \\"consultative selling\\" is now seen as manipulative.) And I found the book humorous because I found that I was laughing at myself. Pink introduces us to Norman Hall. Hall is shadowed as he goes through his usual (and traditional in many ways) sales job in San Francisco. Hall is the very last Fuller Brush Salesman. Why that made me laugh is because I am old enough that I brush my hair almost every morning with a Fuller Brush that my mother gave to me one Christmas when I was a young teenager. I have been using it ever since. I remember the Fuller Brush man (and yes, they were all men as far as I know) ringing our doorbell and brining new products into the house for my parents to purchase. By the way, what product do you still use that was purchased more than 50 years ago?<br /><br />Since I spent many years as a professional salesperson, the passing of the traditional sales model is, for me, more disturbing than the passing of our usual business models or the accelerating obsolescence of products. There isno going back though, and those who work in the sales function would do well to read Pink's view on how things have changed. For those of us not in a direct sales function would do well to understand that fundamentally we are all selling in one way or another. Indeed, to sell is human.no going back though, and those who work in the sales function would do well to read Pink's view on how things have changed. For those of us not in a direct sales function would do well to understand that fundamentally we are all selling in one way or another. Indeed, to sell is human.

B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin never Produced an album without  at least one Classic Track.  Each had it's own unique character. Houses of the Holy In my opinion always kinda seems to get left out of the bunch. When most people bring up Zeppelin albums for Discussion LZ II  IV  And  Physical Grafitti seem to dominate the Discussion. Houses of the Holy may be the Best Band for he Buck of all of their albums. With only 8 tracks it offers everything in the Zeppelin Cannon and then some. Dancing Days and D'yer Mak'er are balanced with The Ocean and No Quarter. Maybe not a starter album for those New to the group but Definetly a Second Purchase. By the Way Most Audiophiles Swear By the Original Versions of the Zeppelin CDs, something to think about.
B009X01FJS|4.0|I was really happy to find this cover does work as described. You can stand it up or sideways and it's very solid. The plastic bottom fits very snug, so it took a little maneuvering to get it fixed right. The case probably doubles the weight of the Kindle, but it really protects it well.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This book is definitely a one-sitting read, or, to be more precise, a one-sitting, tears streaming down, holding in the sobs through clenched lips, rooting for exactly the ending it had kind of book. And very, very well worth it.
B000J103PC|5.0|by far the best movie and most of the gay community loves this movie for the fashion they have gone threw in this movie
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Loved all books in the hunger games series. This is the third book in series and I think I enjoyed it as much or more than the 1st 2 books.<br /> Katniss, 17 year old Game Hunter for her young sister and healer mother. Katniss is a novice tribute who volunteers to take her younger sister`s place in the games, has little belief in her skills or abilities to be the face of a rebel taken over, but thinks she has a better chance a survival than her sister.<br />Katnuss is aided by and in love with two very different men. As she come into her leadership role, the relationships give her an opportunity to grow toward her own emotional maturity and behaviors  that promote and teamwork, like letting go of the need to have control;  not just self serving but self sacrificing so others can have a better life,<br /><br />Seemed rather gorey and explication to see in a movie. Still looking forward to seeing \\"Catching fire (book 2) & mockingjay(book 2)…
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Only loads about 20% of the time, very slowly when it does. It's junk. but the 1that came pre-loaded on my kindle fire doesn't work at all, &amp; Amazon doesn't seem to be interested in fixing it at all, so this is better than nothing, I suppose.
B00794ML3Y|5.0|In Treatment is absolutely awesome!!!  I don't know how I missed it when it was on HBO!  Glad I had a chance to watch it on Amazon.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I love you Pink you tho funny songs that are good and way to go for breaking out of your first album
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Since there were no table of contents I could not find exactly what I w as looking for. And<br />If there was a way I was not was aware of it. Other than that I think s it's a brilliant idea to have a dictionary on a tablet.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Simply cannot update this app. There is something wrong with the package signature. Tried over and over and it simply will not update. Note 2.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|My personal favorite right now. A lot of great courses with varying amounts of difficulty. I highly recommend this app to burning time, if you he it!
B00006RU5B|5.0|great job for first album after breaking up with his first band..  did very well and loved it all together
B00979CS50|5.0|I've listened to Neil Young's albums since my college days a long, long time ago. He has rarely let me down. Now with Crazy Horse at his side again, Young creates an album that is musically engaging, driving and confident, with jams that engage the ear and the heart. The lyrics this time are some of the best he's written.  While most address the hard lessons of age or the gifts of old friendships, most celebrate the dignity of people and the rebel/creator that lives inside each of us. I appreciate lyric booklet included in this two-disc, &lt;80-minute set, and applaud a nine-song recording with the signature sound this musician and his lead band crafted so many years ago.<br /><br />Crazy Horse REALLY shows their stuff here.  Their chops are as good as ever, and their backup vocals sound as if they might have been recorded during the band's heyday. The production is compressed enough to surround the listener with a sound they remember.<br /><br />Still, if there is magic here, it's that Young and the band span the generations with their musical lines, production values and lyrics. The opener, \\"Driftin' Back\\" might describe the world-view of a late teen, a young adult or someone as old as I am. That's not easy. \\"For the love of Man\\" and \\"Walk Like a Giant\\" will move some listeners to outrage, pride, or tears.  They just work.<br /><br />Throughout, Young, Sampedro, Talbot, Molina and Greco create a work that I consider classic.  Some fine wines taste balanced and refined right out of the bottle. Others have to age for a while.  This set works from the first spin: it tastes balanced, full-bodied and memorable right out of the bottle.<br /><br />What a gift Young has given us.  PSYCHEDELIC PILL stands up to the best these artists have produced in over four decades.  And now, the price has dropped on amazon, so no reason to hesitate.  Go for it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this.It is amazing with its videos.This is my oppinion what's yours.So I hope you give it a five.
1609611543|5.0|My doctor recommended that I read this.  I was not a believer in fad diets but most of what the book says rings true with my own experience.  I was hooked on wheat, it cycled my blood sugar causing the need for more food.  My knees hurt and I was considering a knee replacement, I had neuropathy of the feet from more than 20-years.  After 6-weeks on a gluten-free diet, I have lost 15 pounds, most of my knee pair is gone, and my neuropathy is receding.  I am considering dumping a bunch of my medications that treated these symptoms.<br /><br />Most of the medical community doesn't yet buy that wheat can cause a range of anti-immune or inflammatory reactions but many of the doctors I know concede that they seen surprising cures after a gluten-free diet.
B0000640SB|3.0|this movie was great when it came out and like most it does not hold up with time but the newest one is great
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I had so much fun at Christmas time with this app.  It was easy to learn and I didn't get bored at all.  It was great to play all the Christmas Carols I loved.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|enjoyed book and installed it on my kindle for lots of enjoyable hours. Not sure what to say for 7 more words!!!
B000IMKDPC|4.0|X2 is better, but the first one provides a nice bit of context and adds to the overall experience. Enjoy.
B00005YW4H|5.0|loved this album that Norah Jones and put out..  great music that sets the mood in a great dinner party or just back ground music
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Great App!  My 2 year old son loves it! highly recommend! The rooms are interactive and the games are fun!
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I have not read much of what I would consider the steampunk genre, this book being the first.  This book kept my attention and flew by. The characters were very well developed and interesting. I will definitely be looking for next book in this hopeful series. The love story part of this book was what I considered fairly slow developing and made it even better in this case.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I just love this movie.  Had a sad ending but do hope they make a sequel because it just can't stop there.  Looking forward to them making season 4.  It is so popular they must see that it is a best seller.  By the way, it's amazing that they can make such a wonderful series of a movie and no &#34;bad&#34; language.  The movie industry should take notice of this and get their act together.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Gnaris did some great stuff and alto he is black you would never know it by just listening to some of his hits
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book held my interest.  I am 67 and this probably would be better for a younger woman, maybe 20s and 30s, but I have not read this type of story before.  The writing was good and I was able to visualize what was happening because of the description which was enough but not so in depth that you got bored.  Towards the end, it did get a little slow but I still enjoyed the storyline and would recommend this book to anyone who likes something a little different.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|You do not need to be a dog owner nor like dogs to \\"get\\" this movie - which is why i so appreciate this.  This is about life - those around us that allow for the most amazing things to happen.  I recommend this movie to everyone - not just the dog spirited person.  That is exactly what makes this movie so awe inspiring.  What the dog represents - is what we all wish/want humans to represent.  I'm thrilled to have found this story - every home could use this story.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is awesome reading and keeps you on your toes...you will not want to put the book down.  I would highly recommend.
B00006RAKP|5.0|I have loved Elton Johns music most of my life and this is why i have bought this collection three times everytime someone steals it
B009MO5E10|3.0|Glad I didn't go to the movies to see this but it was good to watch one night at home.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is at the top of his game again.  I was worried because I thought his last book dropped off a little, but this one is back to the level of all the other Mitch Rapp books!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout program if you follow what Jillian tells you. The workout is hard so it is tempting to slack.
B000000XB9|5.0|If you love the 70's and the 70's rock songs you best buy CCR for the best of the late 60's and early 70's
B0052RDHTM|5.0|In addition to a spell binding story, Ken Follett provides a wonderful insight into World War I - how it started and what the war was like for both the soldiers and the local citizens.  I read everything by Ken Follett.  He's one of the great writers of historical fiction.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it three reasons: free,fun,fantastic! Those are the five f' s for this game and it is so addicting!so awesome I would recommend this game to people who are horse lovers!
B006QS0PF0|5.0|Came in great condition and I have read and reread it a hundred times!!!!! I absoluutely love it and was very happy over all.
B00005RFAI|5.0|loved this pink cd and altho its her first and she has yet to break out it did very well when she put if out
B009A3NGF4|5.0|The Mumford boys have done it again. Not only have they brought bluegrass into mainstream music, but they have done so with supposed ease. I have always enjoyed their radio play, but it is only the tip of the iceberg. I find it dificult not to sing and dance along with the catchy tune and deep meaningful lyrics on Babel.
B009RI4ZKC|1.0|Just awful.  Boring, dull, poorly done.  Hard to say anything good about this film.  I couldn't survive more than the first 20 minutes before I had to turn it off.
B005XN31LY|5.0|amazing. once upon a time is the best show in the whole entire world. all hands down, all thumbs up.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Loved this great selection of songs!  Purchased for some favorites included and found other selections equally enjoyable! Have always enjoyed listening to this band and glad to finally have a way to enjoy their sound all the time.
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|well my sis has a kindle fire he and it has a camera and she got this app for free so I don't know why the kindle fire and he are different
B009I2UH2W|4.0|I had the previous version of PowerJolt for my iPhone 4/S and loved it.  This works equally well.  The coiled cord is awesome for not taking up space and getting strung out everywhere.  The only drawback to this one, as someone else mentioned, is the really bright white LED light ring around the plug.  It's just too bright and distracting since in most cars it's going to be on the dash somewhere.  I find it distracting to my eye when I'm driving at night and I can't really see any point to it anyway.  I'll likely end up trying to color over it with a black Sharpie or putting some black electrical tape on it.
0143115014|5.0|I'm in the wine business and love how these authors write and talk about scents. I didn't think this book would be quite as interesting as it is and its a great insight into a strange and weird world of scent. Great stuff.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown always keeps the reader riveted. This book was no exception. Couldn't put it down! I absolutely loved it.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|well I don't have any thing to say about it because when I was playing ninjas jump I saw the add it got annoying
B007HACDLK|5.0|His customary excellence.  It was interesting to see Rapp's human side when he was injured.  I eagerly look forward to his next work.
B005HSL626|3.0|this is a great game but it is the non updated version which can be boring which is why amazon should update it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought that Hopeless was not meant for my age group..(56) but as I allowed myself to just go with it, I was reminded of my own teenage years and also some very repressed memories.  Hopeless  never came across as a youth read or a teenage Fifty Shades. I am rattled by how much I loved this book because I wasn't expecting to be so moved by it. Five stars doesn't seem enough...how about a Skyfull.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|every time I watch a TED talk I feel smarter and enlightened. I recommend this app to anyone who wants to learn.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|After reading Eragon I just couldn't stop. Christopher Paolini has created a rich and vibrant world that is super easy to get lost in.
B007T99ENE|4.0|I found parts very heavy and bleak - even if McEwan was making a clever writerly inside joke. Nonetheless, as we can always expect with McEwan - it is engrossing and i empathized with both characters
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't believe there is no district 12 any more. the capital is so twisted and so so so weird.
0375413405|5.0|One of the two basics every cook should own...LOVE IT. Have purchased one for my best friend also. This is a must have.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I started watching the TV series before I was aware of the books.....I read all 5 before season 2 came out. Waiting as patiently as possible for him to write the last books. Best fantasy political intrigue series I've read to date. Tons of characters and points of view for an overall stupendous story.
B007ZYK3CE|4.0|Some people (possibly too many of us) do wake up on a daily basis to extremely tormented lives. I appreciate the film's unapologetic realism that life, despite good intentions and best efforts, is simply life. Human beings are strong and frail and perverse. We're naturally offensive, and will break the rules designed to keep us morally and socially controlled. We snap and break under the pressure of our own demons and the insanity of those around us. We love and we hurt even when we claim indifference. We devolve and we evolve, swimming rebelliously and furiously against the strength of life's undercurrents. We go through cycles of progression and regression, climbing and falling over and over again. In our most secretive places, we're simply human. This film is not about animal cruelty, alcoholism, domestic violence, race wars, class wars, or living in a past that is lost in the present. This film is about how we are bound one to the other in the strangeness of oddly-shaped pieces that fit together to tell one of an infinite number of stories that weave and interlock in the puzzle of life.
B003ZJ70W4|3.0|Perhaps not as insightful or on- point as some of the old episodes, but watch it to enjoy it. Samantha's brash behavior may have been crude and inappropriate, but after a rough day at work, watching this was a great way to unwind.
B005MMYCY6|5.0|This movie kept me on my toes emotionally and intellectually.  I never knew what Hesher was going to do next.  Touching and entertaining.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The screen had a wave in it and was not acceptable.<br />It made it very hard to access key board.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Just as funny as I remember from watching it as a kid.  When Basil picked up Manuel and carried him into the kitchen, I just about lost it, as did my 15 year old son.  Great TV (and I mean some of the greatest ever!), and excellent quality FAMILY entertainment.  I'm SO glad I purchased this!
B002RBZ13Q|4.0|Performances were good, the bonus performances were a very nice surprise. Royal Albert Hall is one cool venue and would love to see The Killers live in Chicago!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.  there's nothing wrong with it. its perfect and adicting like I can never stay off of it because its so much fun!!!!&lt;3 LOVE THiS GAME &lt;3
B004I8WD7S|5.0|El mejor Case que he probado para el iPhone, la cascara no es de esas que parecen de goma, que se dobla y se quita f&aacute;cil. &Eacute;sta es dura y es algo dif&iacute;cil de quitar, y tiene un buen dise&ntilde;o.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game, cant put it down, dl last night and this morning ive already completed 25% of the game. Great game with lots of levels. Plus being able to play timed version or free play and relax and play. Definitely recommend to download.
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is so good and adorable! It's one of my favorites and if you haven't seen it, you should!
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|I just purchased this FREE app and I have to tell you it ROCKS with only 1 exception!!  It works fine when I use it on my Kindle Fire HD but the ONLY other playback option(s) I have are my Gateway Laptop and NOT our PANASONIC SMART VIERA TV. They ONLY offer the PANASONIC SMART TV but hopefully in the future they'll add more variety so I can watch programs on our 60\\" TV.  All in all I am very pleased with the program and it's great being able to watch CINEMAX MOVIIES without being FORCED to pay 1st like they do with DIRECTV EVERYWHERE which is a JOKE!! We have DIRECTV and that program SUCKS because it does NOT do what they advertise it does!  Yes you can watch EVERYWHERE but with a catch -- PAY 1st!!<br /><br />I would have definitely giving this App 5 stars if it would have worked on our PANASONIC and when and if it does I will be rev ising my review.  Until then I will be enjoying what I can.<br /><br />If you are hesitant to try the App as I usually am don't be.  I read reviews 1st to make sure that others had tried it on their Kindle Fire's so I thought what the heck 'let's go for it' !!!
0763655465|4.0|Sweet book about a dog whose prone to trouble. Fun bedtime read. Great pictures. Sweet story line. Nice addition to our reading list.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I don't even know what's say...it is a book that everyone e should read ...ion can't wait to start the next one!!!
1589949811|5.0|I really enjoyed the stories but they can be very hard for starter decks.  You need a few adventure packs before it us possible to tackle all of the stories.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much. It kept me wanting to never put the book down.Just could not wait to get to the end!!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|If you've only seen the movies, give yourself a treat by reading the book.  You'll be enthralled and challenged to know what a repentant life can do!
B0033TJATW|5.0|If you are a Michael Jackson fan, this is a must for your collection.  If you are not a fan, this is still a must for your collection.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that I don't trust anyone that is not a fan of either Michael Jackson or Whitney Houston for that matter.  Moonwalker is one of Michael's greatest works.  I remember watching this over and over as a child along with my sister on VHS.  The storyline, the music, even the acting is great in this movie.  It contains some awesome Jackson 5 footage as well as the footage from Motown 25 when he first did the moonwalker dance.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot say enough great things about this DVD and Michael himself.  Just get the DVD and trust me you'll be satisfied.  Like I said, if you are not a fan (you don't have to be a HUGE fan, but at least enjoy some of his music) then I cannot trust you as a person.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use it daily instead of looking for the hard case calculator. Very handy and has a nice look for use with my Kindle Fire.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|Excellent presentation of facts!  Lots of never-heard-before information about MJ.  If you enjoyed his music, you should read about his life.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this movie. We watched it more than once. We all like this genre. Keep watching after the credits.
B0063M22QO|4.0|fast and fun. easy to play. great for passing the time. the tiles are bright and easy to read. good fun.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't get enough of this!  Good story with lots of twists and more zombie head bashing action than previous seasons.
0345803485|1.0|This book was originally self published, and it is a great example of why books should have a publisher and an editor.<br />There is WAY too much repetition, too little understanding of the real corporate world, too many mistakes with dialog (James is English and writing as an American and American's don't talk like this. In my 20 years in the US I have NEVER heard anybody say 'Holy Hell'!). There are actual examples of incorrect English (unforgivable for an English writer!). EXTREMELY SLOW STORY - mostly very boring to read - ESPECIALLY THE SEX SCENES (Who ever has an obsession with a 'lower lip'?)<br />This book is a painful read for an intelligent mind!<br />If you have even half a mind, please save it the torture and don't bother with this trash!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed the second book of the Games. Very action packed.<br />  Only thing is that some is to fast paced and skips a little.<br />  Ending is good but leads a bit of a cut off towards next book.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Awesome book. Will keep you nailed to your favorite reading place for hours. Perfect for kindle as its an 800 plus pages book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome book I love it... best book I've read of this series.I hope you make more because you are super creative and funny
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|So, if you've seen the previews, save yourself the 1.5 hours and do something worthwhile. It was disappointing and the guy just became annoying as the movie went on.
B001Q9J4PG|4.0|Very action packed, hard to put down!  The story bounces around but is easy to follow. Another Tom Clancy action book to enjoy.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game! The puzzles are fun to figure out and sized so that they're great fillers for when you're just trying to keep yourself amused for a few minutes.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great book...ending is a little confusing but overall it was a good book I'm sure I'll read again and again.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|works very well on my kindle.  I am able to keep up with all my contacts and write on my wall.
B001VFTYW8|5.0|Was a good read. Patricia gave just enough information to keep you interested. The ending was not what I expected. I could not put it down.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|The was an amazing movie. It reminds us of what a father will do for a daughter - AMAZING MOVIE!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|First of all it works. That is not a given with apps.<br /><br />Second it is both fun and addictive. I don't want to stop playing.<br /><br />Short review, but it says it all.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Just A<br />nother HikeThe fi\rst chapter of this book is very, very sad but it compels you to continue reading.  The book holds one's interest but is not very exciting.<br />It is a pleasant read and easy reading book with much description of the Pacific Coast Trail.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was wonderful!  Very heart warming. I recommend this book to anyone who love a good story. You will not be sorry, guaranteed!!
B0030B0S2Q|4.0|It's nice to see a movie with a new idea and acted well. Huge fan of the movie and have been recommending to friends since I watched it.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|It's a pretty good mahjong game with interesting puzzles, but I have to take off a star for the unavoidable ads for their other games every time you start.
B00181MHQU|5.0|A wonderful story of love and immigration to America. The acting, music and scenery cannot be topped. An American classic.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|The app works just as promised if you give it a few seconds of your time. Facebook login is not compulsory, you may simply press \\"skip\\". It does need a particular home/tv/network setup but most people nowadays have it - just read the requirements.<br /><br />Lots and lots of interesting online stuff to chose from; the ability to play content from my phone on my TV is a massive plus - great to be able to access all that from wherever I am.
0060557818|5.0|If you are familiar with London then this book will certainly get your attention.  I am not a sci fi or fantasy book reader but this book was really good.  You feel the struggles of the main character and even when the struggle is something unfamiliar you can still somehow empathize.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Adored this movie. Even though I had some trouble with the accents. These two were adorable and the music was wonderful, all set in Ireland. Loved it. Have watched it many times.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|American Horror Story Asylum is twisted and awesome. Two thumbs up to the writers for creating something that is deeply creepy and very entertaining.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|LIKE IT, BUT VERY DESCRIPTIVE...KIND OF TOO MUCH!! ESPECIALLY THE HYENA KILLING AND EATING THE ZEBRA...ALITTLE TOO MUCH FOR ME BUT A GOOD READ OVERALL!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We loved the movie...the condition of the product was perfect and the delivery was super fast! Easy and convenient and a nice change for the disney princess movies
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I've read it three times since I originally bought it. Who could not love a story about a vampire and a witch who fall in love? Both main characters are strong in different ways and their differences complement each other. I loved the setting and the world building was incredible. The writer clearly has done an amazing amount of research. I am a history buff and love historical fiction and this has an edge of that. The backdrop was skillfully woven into the narrative and the secondary characterizations made me want to read more about them as well. Something tells me this trilogy will remain a favorite for a long time.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Epic, rad &amp; truly amazing dragons best app ever  golden award<br />Winner in my opinion ament for dragon lovers ~naja
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book.  In fact I could hardly put it down!  It has all the elements of a good thriller - fast paced, twists and turns and all the suspense you want.<br />This is an author who knows how to spin a tale and keep you up all night so you don't miss anything.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Very addictive, and cute puzzle game. Super adorable little blobs of cute and quite funny too. Can't stop playing, ever.
B0090SI4HO|4.0|Just saw the movie...<br />First thoughts are it was very, very good to see Arnold back in action!<br />Arnold looked older, which was expected, but he looked good.<br /><br />Arnold definately looked slow at times with his movements & acting. I could tell he is rusty!<br />However, he did play a good Sheriff & had a few memorable lines.  He also showed some of his Strength & Fighting ability from the past in the films major fight scene.<br /><br />Arnold, had a good supporting cast(including the humor of J. Knoxville, and the solid performance of Forrest Whittaker), so that took a lot of pressure off Arnold to take on the whole persona & load like he has in some of his past movies.<br />Meaning, all eyes were not just on Arnold!!!<br /><br />The storyline was good! Acting was good enough to make the movie work!<br /><br />It was just Awesome to see Arnold back & he will only get better with more movies to come.<br /><br />I give this movie an overall grade of a B...<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review & thanks to Arnold for returning to acting!!!<br />I have missed ya big guy!!!<br />Im ready to see you in another Terminator!!!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Listen to radio stations from around the world or put in your favorite genre and let the app find stations that fill the bill. People complain that there is no pause button, but I dont know of any \\"real\\" radios that have one. I stream music from all over the world, and never had a problem (I hope I just didn't jinx myself).It sounds great with or without headphones on my HTC Rezound. It is so easy to navigate through so many stations. You can set your favorite stations, artists and songs. (You cant beat that) I love music and I love getting it from all around the world. It is truly amazing. Except for the clock and weather apps on my phone, this app is the one that I use most. Well worth 99cents. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004XDYJRU TuneIn Radio Pro]]
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much my daughter and husband do to! anyone should get this game it is truly awesome
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Good source of wisdom, knowledge about the human psychology and nature tested in the most extreme environment of the nazi death camps
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Further details on  the home late at the house and Senate committee for the kindle charger to be able to get over it's break up.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You should get this app. It is very fun! All you have to do is connect the Colors together. This game is very fun. I recomand you getting it. Thanks
B0083GR6Y6|2.0|I thought this movie would be good but instead I found it to be boring... I thought the actinb was good but it was way to dark of a story for me.

B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling is a master at creating and describing characters. The village of people she created in A Casual Vacancy captured my interest and i couldn't put the book down. Those who don't like this book are looking for more Harry Potter (based on the reviews i read) and want more fantasy stories. I think Rowling is an excellent writer and hope she continues to write more about the real world.
