0738727326|5.0|The artwork is beautiful. I really like these cards. I am still a beginner when it comes to tarot readings, but I can definitely see me using these for reading for friends. They are gorgeous and really tell the story of the cards. I highly recommend these.
B00006GA4C|3.0|Without lyrics writing inside this has to be one of the best work of Grand Funk. Contains songs like Paranoid (not the Black Sabbath song) In Need, Mr. Limousine Driver, Inside Looking Out, and for me the best song: Got this thing on the move. Is you have to buy only one cd  of Grand Funk collection this it is.
B00136JQOG|5.0|A staple of 80s Music.  She may be weird but her music is good and this album is a great collection of that music
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|2 of 2 is so much better than the first! Absolutely loving this cd and it's right up there with Future Sex Love Sounds.  Take Back the Night and the very funky Drink You Away are hot, but the whole cd works for me.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have waited for this last book in the series and am not disappointed. It had all the excitement, happiness and heartache of the first two. I am going to miss the characters. They have become almost real to me. I hope to see more from Ms Roth in the future
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|Not as good as Future Sex Love Sounds but it's doable.  It's a pretty good listen, and as usual, some nice beats.
B000092ZYX|2.0|Yorke has his moments. I was once a huge fan and listen to the albums so many times that I can never listen to them again.<br /><br />From memory, this was an utter disappointment. Its not self-parody or over indulgence; it is an earnest wallow in excrement. Yorke wanted to capture everything Radiohead has said before and make it even more hopeless. If it wasn't possible then it just didn't click like before. It didn't work.<br /><br />There's only two really good songs on the entire album, maybe three. 'Sail to the Moon' is rock-bottom for Radiohead, a smarmy, obligatory and uncharacteristic exercise in wish-fulfillment. A pathetic song.<br /><br />Musically the album is variable, and there are flashes of past brilliance. Sit Down, Stand Up is dramatically very well done, as is There There and We Suck Young Blood. But some are forbidding, like Myxomatosis; its not something I can actually listen to, or Punch up: they are dragging experiences. Their catastrophizing about Americanism has become too explicit and bluntly stated, so the poetry isn't there anymore and we're left with one diatribe after another.<br /><br />Radiohead knew this, as evinced by their subsequent albums, which are exercises in simply having fun, exercises that fail because they feel like rehab projects. Yorke actually removed himself from the band in an attempt to extradite the process with his solo albums, which for that reason also fail, and for that matter they both sound almost exactly the same as Thief. Radiohead can never not be Radiohead, no matter how hard they try. I hope Yorke faces up to that before the end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good way to relax and have some fun. Challenging but not frustrating like some games I have played. Keeps you busy trying to find what you need but pretty straightforward. If you want a game that is fun and relaxing to do I recommend this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wonderfully addictive game so. glad to be able to play it on my KIndle. This is a game that I play with family &amp; friends in friendly competition for highest scores.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the other two books in this series so much that I was telling all my friends about them!  Now that I have finished this one let me just say I am extremely disappointed!  The book was really slow and like others I didn't care for the ending.  I won't put any spoilers in my review but I was sad at the end and really had hoped it would have gone a different direction.

B008OOYALE|1.0|I have now used both aneroid and kindle apps for Dragon Story. Both suck. Aneroid force closes all the time, but at least you can get free gold by downloading other team lava games. Kindle does not seem to forces close much, but forget about getting any offers to down load, pet story, restraunt story, or any other teamlava games for 15 free gold pieces. Also it takes for ever to build up your gold supply only getting three a day.
0765337320|5.0|Ender's Game is a thrilling ride that will keep you captivated from beginning to end. It is masterfully told and keeps you engaged through out. If you are anything like me, you will read the book in one sitting and refuse to do anything else till you are done reading. Yes it is that good.<br /><br />I do warn however, there is often references to naked young men, penis's, groin etc. The story is based in a school in space that is mainly all guys. That being said being a locked up school, the students learn quickly to be comfortable around one another.<br /><br />We highly recommend this book!

B00DMK6WN4|3.0|How are all these people writing a review of this DVD if it's only been out a couple hours. I saw many of these reviews months before the DVD was released. Not one review that I've read is telling me about the DVD, Blu-ray, 3D set. How's the picture quality? How's the quality of the 3-D? What about the extras? Are there any, because I'm not seeing one person's review that's mentioned any of this. Also it would be helpful if all these people could tell me what the secret is to acquiring this DVD prior to the official release of 10/29/13. I'd like to order this but I'm wanting to see reviews about the DVD, Blu-Ray, 3-D.

B002OMZTSU|5.0|I have always like Craig Ferguson and wanted to know more about him. This is an agonizing story, sort of the before AA handbook. It has given me more than a biography of a person, but a real picture into the world of addiction. It is painful yet upbeat .
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Holy Physics, Batfan!  An excellent yet 'simple' physics simulator, and a lot of fun.<br /><br />I don't think I've seen an app yet with such a thorough walk-through training/tutorial and explanation.  Sets the bar as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />The caveat is that it has a couple of 'ads' for the developer's other apps.  I'd like an option to turn those off.  This is especially important since clicking one of them takes you to a screen which tells you abut the app.  That screen has a \\"Get It\\" button which opens your Amazon Appstore.  So if you don't have your Amazon Appstore password projected then it's very easy to accidentally purchase the other app offerings from this developer.<br /><br />The game is quite attractive, and clean.  Certainly the dev cares about this app, and it shows.<br /><br />Summary: THUMBS UP!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|My young daughter is at that special age when she can watch a movie over and over and over again. Once the movie ends she wants to watch it again, immediately. Currently her favorite film is The Lion King and what a blessing it has been. Having seen the movie now dozens of times I have come to recognize the genius of it and why this movie grossed nearly a billion dollars worldwide back when that really meant something. The Lion King really is a near flawless masterpiece and perhaps the most well-crafted Disney animation ever.<br /><br />Back in the 90's Disney would produce two animated film simultaneously and according to the special features The Lion King was being done by the secondary unit while Pocahontas was getting the top talent. Maybe that's not 100% correct but it seems that the belief by Disney was that between the two Pocahontas was going to be the masterpiece. To put it mildly Lion King is so superior to Pocahontas that the two aren't even in the same galaxy in terms of quality. Pocahontas was an unrestrained mess with totally un-relatable characters while The Lion King had characters the viewer could feel invested in. It's ironic that a movie with an all animal cast felt more human than one that is mostly humans. Disney has a bad habit of making protagonists that feel detached and vacant, then giving them sassy, annoying sidekicks and one dimensional enemies. The Lion King breaks the trend by including real emotions, real motivations and a believable and uncluttered storyline. The movie doesn't pander to adult or child which is probably why both tend to love the film.<br /><br />Disney is known for going the extra mile in trying to observe and emulate animal movements in their animations and The Lion King is one of the best. There is some obvious anthropomorphism of the animals but the way Simba and the other animals move and look are really reflective of actual animals. Well, excluding Rafiki's silly karate sequence. The voice acting is superb most notably James Earl Jones as Mufasa and Nathan Lane as Timon but for me the standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar. If there is a better Disney villain than Scar I haven't seen it. Scar stands apart from other Disney villains in that he is not simply a malevolent foe of the protagonist. Scar's back story isn't really fleshed out but there is clearly some past pain and disappointment motivating his actions and as a member of Mufasa's and Simba's family it brings an even more tragic element to the story.<br /><br />A lot of people put Beauty and the Beast as the best Disney animation but as far as I'm concerned The Lion King beats it in every way possible. Before watching The Lion King my daughter's favorite go to film was Finding Nemo and although I love the film after so many watching I was begging for something else but there is just something about The Lion King that makes it so special and so rewatchable. Even fantastic films like Peter Pan, My Neighbor Tororo, Kiki's Delivery Service and Dumbo began to grate after a while. This may be Disney's greatest lightning in a bottle but thank God that for one brief moment they caught it for all of us to enjoy.tably James Earl Jones as Mufasa and Nathan Lane as Timon but for me the standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar.

B000244FDW|5.0|Now that I've seen both this version and the 1995 A&E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, I have to say that this BBC version has become my favorite. It wasn't in the beginning but by the end I was in love. The A&E version is probably a lot more relatable for people because it is pretty lively and zesty. The emotions are more apparent and you don't have to do a lot of picking apart of the scenes in the A&E version. That makes it more approachable than this BBC 1980's take on the story.<br /><br />Subtle is the word that I would use to describe this miniseries and that's what eventually captured my heart. The reason that I LOVE BBC historicals is the subtlety. Two people look at each other and it's like a declaration of love. At the beginninig I felt as if the movie was a bit stiff but after the first hour I was enchanted. David Rintoul plays a very restrained and quiet version of Mr.Darcy. I felt like Rintoul's Mr.Darcy was way more enamored of Elizabeth than Colin Firth's version. He couldn't take his eyes off of her, tried to make conversation even though he was pretty awful at it and the proposal scene...it was endearing how horribly that went for Darcy. I really felt like Rintoul excellently played Mr.Darcy as a man who has no idea what to do with himself when he finds that he's in love.<br /><br />Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth. Loved her. Absolutely loved her. She was a woman with a srong mind and opinion who gets a muddled up when she's so dead set on one idea that she misses the truth of what's going on and forgets that there are always two sides to a story. As much as I loved Elizabeth Gavie's performance and am quite aware that she gets the most screen time of anyone, it's Mr.Darcy who really stole the show in this one.<br /><br />So, because of the fact that I feel this BBC version isn't as in-your-face as the A&E version, I love it in all of its glory. It didn't even feel dated to me and I like that it made me work a little to catch Elizabeth andMr.Darcy falling in love.

B00EMGUT1I|5.0|I have been somewhat of a Motorhead fan since their Iron Fist album first came out.<br />I`ve owned Iron Fist, Another Perfect Day , and now this new album Aftershock. Bought each new when they were first released, So you see I`m not a huge fan just a fan. I think I`m becoming a huge fan after hearing Aftershock.<br />This album is my favorite of all I have heard through out the years. Many bands seem to peak in their first five recordings yet many claim that their newest is their best. Motorhead can claim their latest is their best. Aftershock is almost perfect no filler.<br />Production wise the vocals are a little low in the mix. I give it five stars. I bought CD at Walmart without any preview of it. I hit the jackpot with the purchase. Thank you! Motorhead for a fine representation of your work, Love it! worth it!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Great Bond film. Daniel Craig is best Bond since Sean Connery.  Action packed and several unforeseen twists kept me on the edge of my seat.

B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Entertaining and enjoyable adventure, even for us older folk. Lovely graphics, nice sequence of puzzles and activities, with hints accessed through the magnifying glass to keep the story moving when we are stumped. Sometimes I used the puzzle solver hint for the first part of a puzzle and was able to finish it without referring back to the solution, even though I could have done that, and I could still enjoy some of the challenge. They seem to have thought of everything! I'll definity look for another of their adventure games.

B00DJWV11I|5.0|I truly loved the way this book was written. The main character &#34;Drew&#34; is the witty and sarcastic narrator. I fell for Drew and Kate's story. This couple was written so well. I had not laughed this hard at a book in along time. Some of Drew's quotes and descriptions were hilarious. The niece with the cuss jar did me in. I could actually picture those scenes in my mind. Some of the things said between friends and family members in my opinion dead on real and funny. This was a great read for me and I cannot wait for the next two in the series. Thank you, Ms Chase...I loved this book!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Seems like a silly question, right? But by &#34;going inside&#34; countless books over the years the answer is clearly, Quite a few self-pubbers. Save yourself the headaches of doing things over (and over and...). Get your books approved the very first time: just read (and follow) this book. CONFESSION: I'm a paper-person. So I took notes by subject (Images; Formatting Text; Covers; etc.), each of which got its own series of index cards. That way as I prepped my files I laid out the appropriate cards and didn't have to flip back and forth through the tablet-book.

006202406X|5.0|All of the negative reviews surprise me a bit because they don't deal with this book as a part of the greater whole. Trilogies are usually sculpted as one piece but spit into three for any number of reasons. And I can't help but see Allegiant as the final piece of sculpting that made the first two volumes exceedingly more meaningful and deep.<br /><br />For me the reveal of Chicago as an &#34;experiment&#34; didn't make the first two books pointless but gave so much more weight to the characters actions and lives. Our caring for the characters and their will to survive and matter is magnified by their struggle to find meaning when they learn they are part of an experiment. But because we already have seen their beautiful and flawed humanity we KNOW that they have meaning. That humans--even as the subject of an experiment--matter. We know that their choices and relationships are significant. That nothing can take that away. And I think that is why Allegiant takes the Divergent series to a much deeper level.<br /><br />It isn't just about the fight for survival or against a ruthless government or about finding where you fit it. In Allegiant it becomes so much more about where ones personal identity is found. If our lives matter. And Veronica undoubtedly lets us know that they can matter. And our death can too.<br /><br />That's why Allegiant is the perfect ending to one of my favorite YA series.
0385537131|4.0|I have some problems with the previous reviewers who claim this is John Grisham at his best ever or who claim this is fine fiction. That said, however, Sycamore Row is John Grisham doing exactly what a reader has come to expect and doing it as well as ever. We return to comfort food over and over because it is familiar, because it satisfies, and because we can depend on the flavor. There is no disappointment here. Jake Brigance and his friends are likeable characters; their challenge is realistic and historically representative of the time. There is no deterioration of Grisham's talent and ability to tell their story.

B007PF7MGS|1.0|I read this book and followed the diet. I did not lose an ounce. I was also nervous about eating all that bread which is, in my opinion, a processed food. I just don't think you can really be healthy eating foods that spike your blood sugar this way. Read Why We Get Fat by Gary Taubes. THat one worked better for me. Eating potatoes all day and insulin spiking bread, rice and pasta is not my idea of health.

1250030951|5.0|I think I'm in love.  Seriously, though, I want to live in this book.  Rainbow Rowell has gained a new fan and I can't wait to check out her other books.  (I confess, I haven't read Eleanor and Park yet!)<br /><br />Cather is one half of a set of twins.  Cather (Cath) and Wren (makes Catherine, get it?) couldn't be more different.  Cath is an introverted nerd who spends all her free time writing fan fiction about Simon Snow (think Harry Potter.)  Wren spends all her free time partying with her new college roommate.  This puts a gap in Cath and Wren's relationship which opens Cath up to a whole new world of people.<br /><br />Cath is super easy to relate to, being an introvert myself.  She's shy, nerdy, and awkward (traits I definitely share.)  She's beyond easy to like and I was immediately caught up in her story.  Wren was not nearly as easy to like but she was a good person.  She was nasty to Cath a lot and she didn't always think things through but she grew throughout the book.  Reagan, Cath's roommate, was one of my favorite characters.  She seemed mean at first but it was just her personality.  She was super sarcastic and pretty much every comment out of her mouth made me laugh.  And of course there is Levi.  He is my newest fictional crush.  He's super sweet and sexy (in a gangly way) and he's always there for Cath.  They have a wonderful friendship.  Everything about him was perfect (including all his imperfections.)<br /><br />The setting really helped make Fangirl fabulous.  It's a realistic college setting that's both beautiful and true to reality.  I want to go to school there.  There's a good mix of class time, extracurriculars, other college activities, and some time spent at home.  Fangirl really showed how family dynamics can still work even when away at college.<br /><br />The story is contemporary (obviously) so it's not super action-packed or thrilling but it's still completely unputdownable.  There's plenty going on in the story to keep readers interested from beginning to end.  Even at over 400 pages I never felt that it was too long or overdue.  In fact, I would have loved more!<br /><br />Overall, Fangirl is a total must-read.  It's a new favorite of mine and I highly recommend it to fans of contemporary novels.terested from beginning to end.  Even at over 400 pages I never felt that it was too long or overdue.

1451696191|5.0|Once again, I feel like I am one of the last bloggers to read this book. I've had it on my shelf for at least two years and I just haven't picked it up until now. I will admit that the movie is what made me read the book. I can't see movies without reading the book so I forced myself to read this one so I can see the movie. I am so glad that I made myself read this one finally!<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is told all in letters from Charlie to an anonymous friend. To me, this style of writing did two things. It made the story quicker and easier to read (and it's already a pretty quick book since it's only 213 pages.) It also made the story seem more real. You never find out who the anonymous friend is and it's almost like Charlie is just writing letters to the reader. This is one of my favorite styles of writing and I loved it in this book in particular.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is what I would call the quintessential \\"issue\\" book. I cannot think of a single \\"issue\\" that wasn't addressed in this book. Stephen Chbosky tackled suicide, teen pregnancy, homosexuality, drugs, alcohol, and so much more. He didn't shy away from anything. Normally I might think that all these \\"issues\\" are too much but in this case I didn't think that. Each \\"issue\\" was handled very truthfully and everything felt real. It didn't seem overdone at all.<br /><br />Charlie was such a unique main character. I loved him so much. He was a very messed up kid and I honestly couldn't figure out what was wrong with him. I also knew that he had a secret but I never once guessed what it was. When I finally found out, it broke my heart. Everything that Charlie went through killed me. I laughed with him, I cried with him, I went through every emotion. As for his friends, they were all perfect. They brought out different sides of him and they helped him grow so much.<br /><br />Overall, The Perks of Being a Wallflower definitely deserves all the praise it's been getting. If you haven't picked it up yet, do so now!ou haven't picked it up yet, do so now!

B00B19G01C|5.0|This is definitely one of the better horror films I've seen in the last couple of years.  It's got believable characters and no lame plot devices used just to move from one set piece to the next.  It just works, and works well.

B00EL8I8IS|2.0|The film had some implications that I felt were Very bias and Very obvious. Overall it was a good action movie and deviated from the norm as far as Zombie movies go. Aside from the \\"finding a cure struggle\\", but even that is given a creative twist. Unfortunately I found the political implications to be too disturbing to see past.
0812550706|5.0|\\"Ender's Game\\" (EG) has a storyline, characters, settings and action that create obvious appeal for the junior high or high school reader.  Yet unlike so much \\"young adult\\" fiction, it has enough depth and meaning to thoroughly satisfy the parents of those teenagers.  It deservedly won the Hugo and Nebula Awards, and has just now been made into a Hollywood sci-fi movie with big budget special effects.  I am writing this review right before the movie comes out, and given how good the book is, and the fact that the book is almost always better than the movie, I feel very confident in saying that if you liked the movie, you will love the book.  And if Hollywood falls short in their necessarily abridged interpretation of the book, then you really should read EG.<br /><br />The plot of EG is straightforward: a gifted young boy from a unique family is chosen by the powers that be to go off to military training school, along with similarly selected peers, in the hopes of someday leading the humans' military force in a successful war against a distant enemy species that has attacked humanity in the past.  The plot contains one major twist at the end, which I didn't see coming and won't reveal here.  Throughout the book there are plenty of action sequences, especially mock training battles and larger scale military encounters, which hold the reader's interest and should make for a compelling movie, if the special effects are done well.  But as in all good literature the plot is secondary to the deeper thoughts that it reveals.<br /><br />At its core EG is a psychological drama, and a case study in power plays between superiors and their subordinates.  The lead character, Ender, is a reluctant hero, and goes through much angst and soul searching as the difficulty of the tasks he is put through increase.  He is not sure he is committed to the cause, and what he is being asked to do constantly changes, to the point that he feels he is being singled out for torture.  He is toldthat he is playing a game, yet he is not sure how to win or if he wants to win.  For all these reasons I can see the appeal to teenagers: to many of them, Ender's struggles probably feel like high school.<br /><br />Yet there are other interesting side stories and characters that add to the depth of EG.  The primary officer in charge of Ender's training is himself unsure about whether his plan will succeed.  His superiors are constantly second guessing him and he knows that he will ultimately be judged by them in hindsight.  He has to occasionally tell himself that the ends justify the means.  To many adult readers, this will feel an awful lot like the typical professional workplace.<br /><br />The minor flaw in EG, in my opinion, concerns two other secondary characters, Ender's brother and sister.  Ender's sibling's share some of his personality traits and powers, yet they both have what others (including Ender) consider to be character deficiencies.  Author Orson Scott Card creates an intriguing side plot involving the two of them, yet doesn't have enough time to fully explore their activities, given the primary focus in the book on Ender.  A book focused on Ender's siblings, with Ender as a side plot, would be an equally intriguing book, in my opinion.<br /><br />\\"Ender's Game\\" is heartily recommended for all adult readers, young and older.

0393338827|4.0|\\"The Big Short\\" (TBS) is not an exhaustive history of the bursting of the housing bubble, although it does contain descriptions of many of the key events and underlying causes. Rather, it is primarily a profile of some rather eccentric individuals, outside the mainstream of the U.S. financial industry, who not only correctly diagnosed the flawed mortgage finance system, but who made fortunes by finding ways to bet on its ultimate failure and collapse.  In financial industry parlance these individuals are called \\"shorts\\", and \\"the big short\\" is a large bet placed on the ultimate failure of something, in this case the U.S. sub-prime mortgage market in the mid-2000s.<br /><br />To make a fortune by placing a short bet, you almost by necessity have to be an iconoclast operating well outside the mainstream, as you have to place your bet when times are good and the cost of a short position (for example, flood insurance) is minimal because no one else believes bad times will come (as opposed to buying flood insurance hours before a hurricane is due to make landfall).  And sure enough, the shorts portrayed in TBS are far from your typical Wall Street brokerage firm employee.  Several of them have deep-seated psychological issues that stem from bad things that happened to them earlier in life.  These unfortunate events cause them to have a more pessimistic view of the world and also to feel as though they do not fit in with their peers and society as a whole.<br /><br />The contrast that author Michael Lewis draws between the shorts and folks in the mainstream of the U.S. financial industry during the good times is striking.  The shorts absolutely believe the sub-prime mortgage industry is a house of cards, and yet they are ignored, shunned or vociferously criticized for their views.  Meanwhile, the amount of money flowing to the individuals and firms in the mainstream who are building and expanding the house of cards is staggering.  Everyone except the shorts is patting themselves on the back and cashing large checks, and yet the entire financial structure that they have erected is flawed and about to collapse.<br /><br />Michael Lewis started his professional career on Wall Street, and casts an appropriately critical eye on its dealings and its pay structures.  The shorts portrayed in TBS ultimately did very well for themselves, but so did far too many of the people who built the house of cards.  That money can never be recovered, and it ultimately represents a gross misallocation of capital, with future U.S. taxpayers footing much of the bill.  As Michael Lewis shows in TBS, the U.S. government, through its explicit policies to encourage the growth of the sub-prime mortgage industry, and Wall Street, which figured out how to profit from its growth, conspired together to inflate the housing bubble, and in that sense share the blame.  The portrayal of the shorts in TBS shows just what it takes to be one of the early voices telling the emperor that he has no clothes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting yet frustrating, I have played for hours not even knowing until I run out of lives.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is as relevant now as when it was written, because it is first and foremost a book about power and politics.  Although the setting is exotic, it is a case study in the different ways that a person can acquire power and rule over others, overtly and covertly.  The lessons that Dune teaches are repeated in the daily newspapers of today, and will be recognizable to anyone who pays attention to what happens in the political arena and inside nearly any institution.<br /><br />Dune juxtaposes future technology, including interplanetary space travel, with the political institutions of the past.  While technology has progressed from the present day, the ruling institutions more closely resemble those of the medieval era:  families, tribes, hereditary rulers, religious orders, and secret societies.  Furthermore, the actions of these ruling bodies are quite barbaric.  I don't believe author Frank Herbert is saying that politics will devolve in the future.  Rather, these familiar structures make for compelling drama, and provide a recognizable structure for Herbert to convey his views.<br /><br />Dune is an exquisitely detailed work of art.  In an afterword, Frank Herbert's son provides insight into his father's labors in producing his masterpiece.  That attention to detail comes through in every page, in everything from Herbert's invented words to his descriptions of the invented plants, animals and things which populate the world of Dune.  Far too much science fiction is written in a slapdash manner.  Dune is one of the best examples of the craft, and worthy of its place as one of the most honored science fiction books in history.

1416596585|4.0|If you've read Wired Magazine, there is a good chance that you've read Steven Levy.  Levy has a love of technology and a talent for translating \\"geek speak\\" into language that is understandable by the non-engineering masses.  He must also have an easygoing, non-threatening personality, because for \\"In The Plex\\" (ITP) he was able to gain access to and interview many of the key people inside a fairly secretive Silicon Valley company, Google.  The result is an entertaining, informative history of Google, from its birth in the graduate computer science program at Stanford to its current position as one of the most valuable companies on Earth.<br /><br />I learned more from ITP than I do from most business books, or books about business.  On the technical side, Levy provides enough of a layman's description of Google's search engine, its Adwords program, and its data centers and other technologies to get a decent understanding of what the company actually produces.  ITP hits all the major events of Google's business as it grows, goes public, and starts acquiring other companies.  Levy delves into the management style and practices of the company, some of which are unusual even by Silicon Valley standards, and shows how some of those practices stem from the upbringings of the two company founders.  Interspersed throughout the book Levy offers insights into the personalities and backgrounds of the founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, CEO Eric Schmidt, and some of the other long-time employees at the company.<br /><br />By the end I had gained not only a much better understanding but also a bit more respect for the company.  Yes, there were other computer scientists working on somewhat similar \\"page view\\" web search technologies at the time, as Levy demonstrates, but Larry and Sergey were the ones who managed to create a powerhouse company that today is a lot more than just a better search engine.<br /><br />I feel that Levy does, however, paint a slightly more rosy pictureof Google than he should.  The biggest justifiable criticism of Google regards privacy, or the lack thereof in the Google ecosystem.  As Levy states, some of these concerns are generational in nature, with younger people not as concerned about privacy.  But it is also true that when a commercial company has access to your email, documents and financial transactions, that information could be used against you or for purposes contrary to your wishes.  There are many battles, with Google and the government, yet to be fought over these issues.<br /><br />All in all I definitely recommend \\"In The Plex\\".
B002A56I5E|5.0|If anyone on earth ever felt hesitant and unequipped to tackle the recipes in this masterpiece by Julia Child and her colleagues, they don't need to give it another thought. I was nervous and excited about the pending arrival of this book when I ordered it, and eagerly went through it when it finally arrived.....surprised and overjoyed at what I read.<br /><br />While the recipes require your full attention, they are not as daunting as they may sound. In fact, I immediately saw a small collection of  scattered recipes that I, a working mother, could easily and gleefully make on a day off or quiet weekend. The recipes are accompanied by a list of equipment you will need to make the recipe and very simple, thorough step-by-step instructions.<br /><br />It does take a commitment of time to make many of the recipes, but you probably wouldn't have been looking for this book if you weren't willing to make the time to cook special choices from the book. You would have looked instead at the books featuring ten minute meals featuring minute rice and canned tuna.<br /><br />I have to admit....I wouldn't utilize these recipes several times a week, or even a few times a week.But the book is a treasure and a gem for anyone looking for something special  to make for a special day, a special gathering, or a special person.<br /><br />The book also explains cooking terms, cooking equipment, and some things as simple as how to make a great omelet or poached egg. It would make a great gift for those rare and admirable souls that actually look forward to real cooking.<br /><br />I recommend stepping out with confidence and joy and getting this book......because it is a great exercise in challenging yourself and exploring the wonderful and new! You won't fail. It's designed to help you succeed.<br /><br />Not only will you triumph....but somewhere, silently, Julia will be cheering you on.

B00138H146|5.0|If I could rate this album above 5 stars I would. I have owned it in some media format since it's release in 1974 and loved it from first listen. This was the first album I ever owned by Lou Reed and it's still my fave. In fact it's in my top 10 ALL TIME fave albums ever and is a fabled \\"desert island disc\\" choice. I love the remaster but not the added songs. Give me the original 5 tunes and get out of the way...a sister disc was released a year later, Lou Reed Live that was taken from the same show. Both fit nicely on an 80 min burned disc and make for one great 80 min show (leaving off the two songs added here on the remastered version). What I'd really like to see is a double CD remaster of the complete show for an anniversary release. Nothing would be better to salute Lou's passing, and throw his fans a bone. How about it RCA or whoever now owns the rights to this great recording? We know the tapes of this legendary show are out there...make things right or at least release Lou Reed Live with bonus tracks and a remaster worthy of the performance, material and artist..we will make our own Anniv. Edition!
B00BFIFIPS|3.0|I purchased this case for my iPhone 5s. The coloring was off compared to the pictures online, but other than that it is a nice case with full body protection for the volume buttons and the speakers at the bottom.

B00BAXFECK|5.0|If there is a more brilliant writer than Donna Tartt, this reader hopes to find that person.  The central character, Theo, is 13 when this novel begins. It is almost impossible to review this book without spoilers; however, an attempt must be made.  Theo, whose life is determined by others, due to his age, endures tragedies from which most would never recover.  However, it is not the constant changes Theo endures that drives this novel, it is a theft Theo commits which keeps him in a state of almost perpetual anxiety.  The object is priceless and assumed to have been destroyed.  The longer Theo holds onto the object, the less he is able to think up an explanation for why he has it.  Months turn to years and as Theo is moved from one place to another, it is the object that becomes the constant in his life.<br /><br />Theo is initially taken in by a school friend's parents, a prominent family on Manhattan's upper east side,  who find him to be a stabilizing influence on their other children and are on the verge of adopting him when Theo's biological father shows up and whisks him to a McMansion in a largely abandoned subdivision outside Las Vegas.  Almost immediately, Theo becomes friends with another boy who has been constantly moved by his father who has some oil related expertise which keeps him constantly employed, although the jobs are short and the distances vast.  Boris has learned to speak several languages, spends much of his time stoned and drunk, and, since neither he nor Theo have any adult supervision, they spend a good bit of time hanging around the house, skipping school, getting drunk and stoned and watching television.<br /><br />Again, life intervenes and Theo and a Maltese, Popchick, who was won in a raffle by Theo's father's girlfriend, are on a bus bound back for Manhattan.  The one friend Theo has is Hobie, a furniture restorer who is a bit of a hermit and appears to be a combination of an Indian guru and an NBA basketball star with no business acumen and it is to Hobie's antique shop that Theo returns.  Theo comes quickly to the conclusion that Hobie is drowning and is about to go under for the last time.  Theo, whose scruples have gradually disintegrated, becomes adept at selling reproductions to the uneducated at inflated prices and manages to pay the back taxes and keep the business afloat.<br /><br />However, one or more people have taken notice of Theo's practices and have also come to the conclusion that Theo is in possession of the priceless artifact.  One of the men issues an ultimatum.  Either Theo turns over the object or he will blow the whistle on Theo's fraudulent business practices.  Theo is not overly worried, as the object has been in a storage unit in the Bronx for a long time which was rented in a phony name but the blackmailer turns up the heat and Theo suspects he's being followed.  When Theo continues to ignore deadlines, the original blackmailer demands a lunch.<br /><br />During this lunch, the blackmailer tells Theo he knows exactly what he has been up to and if he doesn't cough up the artifact, he could go to prison for many years.  The man accuses Theo of using the artifact as collateral for loans which are not repaid and then moving on to another unsuspecting lender.  Theo is relieved; he has not used the artifact for any such purpose.  In fact, nobody even knows he has it except Boris, back in Vegas.  And, since Theo hasn't seen Boris in years, he knows that Boris cannot possibly know where he has stashed the artifact.<br /><br />During this time, Theo has become engaged to the sister of the former school friend whose parents were ready to adopt him.  The future bride is dragging Theo from one place to another in an attempt to engage him in the process of picking out china and flatware patterns.<br /><br />Suddenly, up turns Boris, who is now part of a low rent criminal enterprise in lower Manhattan and he and Theo pick up where they left off.  Theo tells Boris about the pressure he is under from the potential blackmailers and relates the story of the object being used as a ploy to borrow money which disappears.  Boris confesses.  He took the object in Vegas and wrapped something up in the same brown paper and string and has, indeed, been using the artifact.<br /><br />Boris concocts a plan where Theo will retrieve his artifact and get some money too.  But, it's a rush rush and Boris whisks Theo away from his own engagement party and puts him on a plane for Amsterdam.  Everything that could possibly go wrong, does go wrong.  The artifact disappears, there is no money, and Theo, stoned out of his mind, is holed up in a hotel with a dead cell phone, not speaking a word of Dutch, his passport is missing and things do not look good for a positive result.<br /><br />To even venture into the conclusion of this wild tale would be to deprive the reader of experiencing how a great writer can turn a plot on the head of a pin and make it work.  If you think you too can write great fiction, read this book and, if you imagine even coming close, you should start writing.  Personally, I'm just going to go back and read one of her earlier books and enjoy it all over again.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The Shining is my favorite in 3 categories:<br /><br />Favorite Stephen King novel<br />Favorite overall horror novel<br />favorite horror movie<br /><br />Yes i know there are substantial differences between the novel and Stanley Kubrick film, but my enjoyment of the story of the Torrances have little to do with the details of the tale and everything to do with what makes The Shining brilliantly scary and unsettling: Atmosphere.<br /><br />I can't possibly convey how excited and worried i was when i learned King was planning a sequel to my favorite horror story. Excited for obvious reasons, worried because i didn't want anything to disturb what in my opinion was a perfectly balanced and self contained story.<br />But curiosity is stronger than any of those other feelings and (like danny standing in front of room 217/237) i HAD to know what was behind that door.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised when i started to read Doctor Sleep. Seeing the Torrances 3 years after the events on the Overlook was great and it really felt those chapters were written back in the 70's by a younger King.<br />I never liked the title Doctor Sleep (and still don't) because i don't think the fact that Danny was helping elderly patients with the process of passing on was very relevant to the story of Abra vs the True Knot.<br />As a Nurse's aide working at a nursing home, i have seen many my patients pass away and i think King depicted those scenes very accurately, but still, i don't see great connection with Dan's work as Doctor Sleep with the main story.<br /><br />At this point in my review i'm going to discuss certain parts of the story that might be considered spoilers. If you want my recommendation: Just buy the book, especially if you're a fan of The Shining. It is very entertaining regardless of anything negative i might have to say.<br /><br />Something that disappointed me with this story were the villains. I though the concept of the True Knot was brilliant but in the execution they didn't deliver as very scary or powerful opponents. They didn't seem too dangerous for other than children, and for supernatural adversaries, they were pretty easy to deal with.<br />I also didn't like the whole you-can-store-steam-in-a-canister plot point. It seemed very campy and something out of a Sookie Stackhouse novel.<br /><br />I know Stephen King has said he didn't set out to write a story as scary as The Shining as he felt nothing he could write could live up to the expectations of the fans, so he settled for a more action oriented tale. And i'd say he succeeded plenty in that aspect.<br /><br />I was also pleasantly surprised with some of the revelations we learn in the latter half of the story, without giving out much details, i think it worked pretty good on how Danny and Abra are connected.<br /><br />As a die-hard fan of The Shining and Stephen King, i would love to see him writing sequels to other of his works. Maybe a continuation of It or The Stand? maybe Salem's Lot? only time will tell. In the meantime i look forward to anything that has his name over the title.

B00ETHPJ1U|5.0|Despite lack of libretto and translation of Bach cantata  in hard copy and you have use the data cd to get notes and the tranlation of cantata as I find inconvenient to listen to cantata with my computer on to read the text and translation.The box set only contains only sacred cantata.You have to be extra carefull to take the cd from the cardboard sleeve as it can tear the flimsy card board .What about the music....nothing less than 5 stars and they are very addictive as I have listening the cast for the 10 days and only on 15 cd.The recording is crystal clear and beautiful sung and not over powering.You will enjoy the way it was recorded.I compare cantata with other conductors but this one  win in all count..To enjoy these cantata to the fullest extent,I recommend to purchase The cantatas of J.S.Bach by Alred Durr which contain text and transalation and notes on each cantata.Purchase the box as it is a limited edition of 3000 world wide before the price goes up.Amazon UK has increased the price to  £166 from the original price of £138. Highly recommended despite the lack of it.Now what about Bob Dylan the complete recordings box set Volume 1 to compliment this set or  is it your answer blowing in the wind.Thanks for reading this review.Does American has a sense of humour.I have the gut to write the review and 2 does not find it interesting and why they o not comments or write a review or is it easy to prss a button than use the brain.Howdy

B0052RDHTM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book from the start.  It starts just prior to World War 1.  It's rich in history and the characters as well.  It's a story of the rich nobility in contrast with the poor and opressed.  The story spans from the Welch coal miners struggles, the nobility of the British and there treatment of the lower class to the arrogance of the German rulers, to the Russians and the struggles within that country for power and the harsh treatment they imposed on their people.  The book does spend a good portion of the book on the battles, politics, and war strategy of each.  It is also a story of the families in these countries-- both of the rich and the poor.  This is the first book of a trilogy.

006202406X|1.0|(Spoiler Alert) It was boring, with dialogue and events  that offer up little new information about the characters you love and even more text with pointless details about characters you don't care about at all. The entire time there was an obvious lack of plot, with small random conflicts arising and then quickly dying out. I don't know if I just couldn't help but compare Tris to The Hunger Games' Katniss, but the entire time I had a hard time hearing Tris's voice or figuring out what she was really about. The author pulled a cheap stunt by killing off Tris- if she wanted to make a statement about Tris being completely selfless then that could have been done in a much more believable way. Instead, Tris's death was so ridiculous that I didn't even consider that she had really died until 2 chapters later when Tobias finds out. Maybe I was too eager to love the series but I've read a lot of books and I don't think I've ever been quite this disappointed with an ending.
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|Before I read this book, I had assumed that Pusheen was just a Facebook emoticon. I'm so glad I picked this comic up! It's a quick, entertaining, and adorable read. Fans of cute drawings and adorable cats will love this! We get to see Pusheen and all her antics, plus we also see her sister, Stormy.<br /><br />I loved how this book could make you laugh and want to share with other people the cuteness that is Pusheen! I was randomly stopping and laughing at random pages before finishing. This is usually about a 15 minute read, but it took me about 40 minutes just because it was really hard to keep from going \\"awwwww\\" every other page or so. When I finished reading this, I read it again, just because I could!<br /><br />The only aspect that I did not enjoy was the fact that I couldn't enjoy the animations as much because I was seeing it from my Kindle.<br /><br />I recommend that if you want a quick, fun read, you should definitely pick up the physical version of this book.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars

0446310786|5.0|I don't know that I can say much to add to any conversation about To Kill a Mockingbird, surely one of the finest novels of the 20th century.  Harper Lee's courtroom drama has been an inspiration to some of my favorite writers of legal fiction, like Mark Gimenez and John Grisham.  But the bulk of the novel is life in small town America, race relations in the South, and learning about class and wealth and poverty, all through the eyes of a little girl.<br /><br />This is perhaps a story that could only be told from the perspective of a child.  As Scout and her brother Jem grow up, watching their father stand as a voice of reason and justice in a world of unreasonable injustice, we are reminded of what we lose as the innocence of youth slowly wears away.  Atticus is what we should aim to be: fair, patience, selfless, and humble.<br /><br />I was delighted that Elliot will be reading this for freshman English later this year.  I have enjoyed getting to know the story again.  Even as the racist attitudes of the South in the early 20th century seem more and more dated, we don't have to read the news or even listen to our neighbors very long to realize that Harper Lee's story is as important and powerful as ever.

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Got this for my Mom for a birthday gift, and she has been so thrilled with it.  I knew that it was a great series, as I had seen several episodes.  This set allowed her to start at the beginning, so she got all that important background info that you need when watching series shows.
B00DSS7BHG|5.0|I recently got interested in The Band after listening to \\"The Basement Tapes.\\" I thought their songs were really \\"soulful\\" on that recording in a down-home Americana kind of way, so I wanted to hear more. That's how I came to listen to \\"The Last Waltz [box set].\\"  I'll simply say that The Band's numbers are performed with such intensity and passion it's as though their lives depended on it. I've heard many a live recording of pop music/rock concerts, and this is one of the very best. As you may know, there are a number of other guest performers on this CD. I will not comment on their performances. They are not what I bought these discs for. I wanted to hear The Band's music, and they are sounding excellent, excellent, excellent here.
014241493X|5.0|My 2 cents:<br />Paper Towns comes off as a light read, but with more weight then you'd expect. It follows the story of protagonist Quentin's last few weeks of High School as his world is shaken up by a adventure with the girl of his dreams, that sets him on the path to learning more about himself, his friends, the world, and the girl he put on a pedestal: Margo. Quentin, through the course of trying to find a missing Margo, comes to question if she is not who he thought she was, for better and worse, and in a road trip to end all road trips is given a chance to learn some life lessons.<br /><br />John Green captures the moments perfectly. His descriptions are sharp, but not overdone, painting a vibrant picture that allows the reader to fill in the gaps. The pace is fast and pauses for breath, but never lets up. It ends in a way that feels true, rather then right or perfect and that's impressive.<br /><br />Extra 2 Cents:<br />I was given Paper Towns by a friend after exposing them to John Green's World History Crash Course and am glad his storytelling style transcends Vlogs. I have already loaned my copy and bought one for a friend.

1449305172|5.0|Throughout the 20th century, technology amazed us. Faced with so many new possibilities we learned to ask the question 'Could it be done?' and, typically, well-resourced large company R&D departments toiled for years and often they showed us that the answer was yes. But quite often they also created products that failed because they didnt fulfil a real need, despite having burned up millions of dollars and years of effort by talented people.<br /><br />Now, in the 21st century, many of us have learned to ask a different question: not 'Could' but rather 'Should it be done?'<br /><br />We have learned how important it is to 'get out of the building' and to understand customers first, before we start creating solutions to problems we have not properly defined. Which is a noble ambition ... but how to do it in practice?<br /><br />I recommend 'Running Lean' because it is so very practical, setting out approaches that work for every step required, from reaching out to potential customers to understanding their feedback. No doubt others will write scholarly books that link Lean Innovation to the academic literature and that will offer a different audience what they want. But for anyone starting out to actually found a business, this is an excellent guide.

B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|I sooo wanted to like this!  I loved Zeitoun and think Eggars is a stellar writer.  Those facts along with the fact that I am an admitted social media junkie convinced me that The Circle would be right up my alley.  It was, for a while.  But then it just seemed to stop moving forward. I kept reading, not because I was enthralled but because I kept believing that something would happen.  But it never did.  Well, I take that back.  Something did happen--it got more ridiculous.  How did this place become her ENTIRE life??  She had no friends??  How did this seemingly nice person suddenly become a complete ass to her parents and ex?  and WHY???  And was ANYONE surprised by the identity of the \\"mystery man?\\"  I called it the moment they met at the party.  Yawn. Annie's breakdown was just silly. And the ending.. wait, how did it end again?  Yeah, it was THAT impactful.  I'd love to reread this concept, just written by someone else.
1451666179|5.0|I wrote a long, detailed review of this, my most precious and almost #1 favorite of all books the day it came out (and I got it because I was smart ebough to pre-order it,,,) but I included a link to Allie's blog, which was a no-no. So I'll give you my tl;dr version... BUY THIS!!! There is no downside. None. BUY IT for all your friends and relatives. They will love you more than the simple dog loves her power to make food. BUY ALL THE BOOKS!!!! The next person who runs for president and really wants to win should ust buy 200 million copies of this and give it to every voter in the country. They will be laughing so hard they will never hear your opponents' commercials and you will WIN THE INTERNET,,, uh, I mean, the election...
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|I will preface this review by saying that I haven't been a King fan in years.  His latest works have been overly long, meandering and just pretty flat to me.  But because this was supposed to pick up where the Shining left off, I was all in.  What a letdown.  It started out well--I really liked the storyline with The True.  But then it shifted focus to something far less interesting.  Why it was called \\"Doctor Sleep\\" I have no idea, as that part of the storyline (Dan working at the hospice and ushering people into the afterlife) was both small and pointless. All that to bring Momo into the ending??  Come on!  Yes, The True remained in the story, but far too much emphasis was placed on Dan, AA, the goofy train and Abra--who seemed to fluctuate from a child (Abba-Do?? ugh) to a grown woman every other page.  One minute she's talking about \\"ghosties\\" and the next she's telling Dan that he has a \\"one hell of a temper\\" and is calling The Hat a \\"whore.\\"  Huh??  King doesn't do kids well and it showed in this.  Overall, the story was twice as long as it had to be and just not all that interesting, let alone frightening. The connections to The Shining were tenuous at best. Yawn.  Oh, there was ONE positive.  There were no gratuitous racial slurs being bandied about.  That's about it.

B00E4W40C4|4.0|Wolverine. He's the best he is at what he does, and what he does isn't very nice.That WAS true, until Hugh Jackman was cast to play him in Bryan Singer's original X-MEN from 2000. He's not the feral little furball people wanted, and oh, how the fanboys cried when they heard that he got his start in MUSICAL THEATRE!!! NOOOO!!! WHAT A PANSY WOLVERINE WILL BE!!<br /><br />And how quickly they were proven wrong. In the first X-MEN film, we see that Jackman understood quickly exactly who Wolverine was, and with X2: X-MEN UNITED, we knew that there was at least one scene that could show how Jackman could properly portray not only the eternal outsider, but showed us how a berserker rage would look like on the big screen. The abysmal failure on every possible level of X-MEN THE LAST STAND and the well-intentioned but still very sub-par X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE had dragged the powerful mutant franchise down. But after the success of X-MEN FIRST CLASS, Fox felt that it was time to give the audience what it was looking for: The definitive Wolverine story. And with director James Mangold (COPLAND, 3:10 TO YUMA) at the helm, and basing their story largely on what is considered by many to be THE best Wolverine story in comics form (1985's four-issue mini-series by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller), they were able to achieve something seemingly impossible. They made THE WOLVERINE, and this is the best film of the MANY superhero films that the summer of 2013 yielded.<br /><br />At its essence, THE WOLVERINE is a noirish romance thriller. Logan, haunted by having to kill his great love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen, who appears in dream sequences) at the end of X3, has become a recluse, living alone in the Canadian wilderness. He is found in the midst of an undesired bar brawl by Yukio (a dynamic performance by Rila Fukushima), a petite yet fierce warrior, to bring him to Japan at the behest of her adoptive grandfather Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), a dying old man Logan saved back when the Americans bombed Hiroshima. Since then, Yashida has amassed a large fortune through his company, and offers Logan the one thing that he may truly want: mortality. It's something that Logan does not initially accept, but it is given nonetheless by Yashida's mysterious doctor, secretly the mutant Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova). It is then that Logan meets Mariko (Tao Okamoto), a beautiful young woman with an abusive and morally bankrupt husband. When Yashida dies, all hell breaks loose as the Yakuza and other criminal elements look to destroy the remainder of the Yashida clan. As Logan looks to defend those around him, he discovers all too quickly that his healing powers are no longer working properly. Logan and Mariko hide from the would-be assassins and they find love in the unlikeliest of places. But like all star-crossed lovers, they might have a very tragic ending if Logan, Yukio and Mariko can't get The Wolverine back.<br /><br />First off, there is very little wrong with the film, but the things that are wrong with it are pretty glaring, and that revolves mostly around the climactic battle with Logan vs. a mecha-ed version of the Silver Samurai. It has really very little emotional stakes, and while very nice to look at, it seems to come out of nowhere. The smaller action beats are the ones that are far more effective and not only showcase Mangold's command of space and character, but they actually serve the STORY AND THE CHARACTERS, which is something not often seen in this current era of action films. The film is smart enough to be different enough from the classic storyline to give some cool surprises, but adheres to it enough to give us a pretty awesome WOLVERINE film. Aside from Jackman, who gives easily his best performance as Logan here, the other real standout of the cast is Rila Fukushima, as the manga-influenced Yukio. She's adorable, funny, smart and utterly lethal. The rest of the cast does commendable work with maybe the exception of Khodchenkova, but that's less to do with her work, and more to do with the script kind of short-changing her character (although if that role had been played by Jessica Biel, who was originally cast in the role, I'm sure that would have been a much more substantial character) The film is also assisted by its Japanese setting. It takes us out of a world we've become overly familiar with in superhero films, which is also a great change of pace. Another problem I do have with this film, though, is its distinct lack of bloodletting. Wolverine is a noble yet violent character; killing is part of who he is, and his claws do about the same amount of damage as in any of his Saturday morning cartoon iterations. Although it's rumored that the extended cut of this film will have more violent content than this PG-13 rated version, I wouldn't think that it would make a whole lot of difference. It would be nice, though, if at some point in the not-too-distant future that they went for the kind of eviscerations that would make Quentin Tarantino jealous.<br /><br />When it's all said and done, though, thanks to a compelling story, terrific direction, a mostly smart script, and some terrific performances, THE WOLVERINE is the film that fans of the character deserved after the failure of X-MEN: THE LAST STAND and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE... which, for some reason, is currently better rated on this site than this film.<br /><br />Snikt!, but that's less to do with her work, and more to do with the script kind of short-changing her character (although if that role had been played by Jessica Biel, who was originally cast in the role, I'm sure that would have been a much more substantial character) The film is also assisted by its Japanese setting.

1551525143|5.0|Now that Julie Maron's BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR is coming to theatres in a feature film that not only won the very prestigious Palme D'or at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and that it was smacked by the MPAA with the dreaded NC-17 rating for its explicit sexual content, and that there is an ongoing war of words between the film's two leads and its director, it should generate enough publicity for not only people to see the film, but to also hopefully discover this remarkable graphic novel.<br /><br />Simply enough, the novel, written and drawn by Maron, is about a fifteen-year-old girl Clementine who is doing her best to be a \\"normal\\" young girl. She dates a senior at her high school, she studies for her exams, and she has the \\"right\\" friends. Until one moment of one day, as she's walking down the street, she passes a beautiful older girl with dyed blue hair, and she cannot get this girl out of her mind. The blue-haired beauty invades her dreams with shocking sensual and sexual imagery, and Clementine can't understand what these feelings mean. She just CAN'T be gay. She refuses it, and in that refusal, her passion for this mystery girl grows. As she sneaks out one night to be with her best friend, Valentin, who is a young gay man, they go to a gay bar, and Clementine meets the mystery girl. Her name is Emma. And from then on, Clementine, no matter how hard she tries, she can no longer deny the feelings of love and lust she has for Emma. But once they finally realize who they are to each other, all the other parts of Clem's life start to spiral out of control. Her parents refuse to accept their daughter's deviant lifestyle, as do her straight friends. Soon, all she really has is Emma, and for a even a short time, that's more than she ever thought possible. But time catches up to all, and it catches up to Clem in a tragic way that is certain to leave everyone in tears.<br /><br />Maron gives Clementine such a realistic voice that any adolescent or someone who survived adolescence and the awakening of desire for love and sexuality can immediately relate. You feel your heart lift when hers does, and even more so, you feel your heart break when hers does. The art and particularly her use of color is excellent. The writing is so strong that you really feel that you're with these characters, and even though you may find some of them despicable, you understand them. Maron never makes the mistake of painting stereotypes of any of the characters, so that even when they do or say something terrible, you understand where they're coming from.<br /><br />And this is the only other graphic novel, aside from Art Spiegelman's MAUS, that has ever made me cry.<br /><br />Again, though, we must go to the place that I hate to go to, which is the argument of Art Versus Pornography. This book, which I'm sure is probably banned in more than a few libraries, has a sequence of graphic sex between Clementine and Emma. This will be objectionable to many parents of adolescents who may receive comfort from the emotional realism of the book, but it is NOT pornography. Pornography is meant for the sole purpose of sexual stimulation, and is not intended to show realistic portrayals of sex. And believe me when I state that there is nothing resembling that in the least in this book. Is it erotic? Yes. Is it art? Yes. Is it pornography? Absolutely not.<br /><br />BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR is an extraordinary graphic achievement, and it's something that I would recommend to anyone with a love for great storytelling and an open mind.ived adolescence and the awakening of desire for love and sexuality can immediately relate.

B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I've only had it since August and now it doesn't work anymore.  First I had problems with the app causing my phone to crash (Android HTC One X).  I tested for several days removing all apps from my  phone reloading the Withings app and within 4 hours my entire phone display would crash and blank out and I would have to reset my phone.  This in and of itself was highly intolerable!  I actually got an email from Withings because they noticed that I had removed the syncing of my pulse from my phone.  I explained the problem via their online survey, they said we are constantly working on our app.<br /><br />Now after all the the dang thing stopped working, the last time I charged it, it got stuck on the hello! screen and won't do anything else, I've now wasted 6 hours trying to reboot it, recharge it, ANYTHING just to make it function.<br /><br />(edit, I shouldn't right reviews when I'm in the middle of a problem)  To that note I wrote to Withings about my pulse not working and they IMMEDIATELY responded and said based on my report it was a hardware issue and they would replace it, I'm actually very impressed with their service responses.<br /><br />On the pulse itself, I really love the Withings scale but I'm not really happy with the pulse, I don't like that it has to sync with my phone, no computer syncing, and that I have to move it every day and night to the wrist strap or the clip..  I'd prefer something that I can put on and forget about all day and night.  I think they make wonderful product but I think the pulse still needs more work to be competitive in today's ultra sleek high end gadget world.

0761172726|5.0|I think this calendar is great!  Perfect for our needs.  As other reviewers said, the space is somewhat limited, but for each day you do get 5 spaces.  I can usually fit a sticker and an activity or 2 activities per space.  Typically, if I have more than that planned per kid, I lose my mind so it works great for us.  Some of the stickers are worthless for us, but many are not & really stand out (birthdays, for instance).<br /><br />This is the 3rd year I'm getting this calendar.  Initially, I thought the 18 month calendar would be annoying and I'd be wasting the calendar.  I've found, though, that it is fine.  The calendar is not over priced for the added 6 months, whether they are used or not.  It might be more useful if the calendar ended in June instead of December for me, but still, this is a 5-star calendar in my book.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|For those who have been rating this low because they don't like ending or think that Veronica Roth should have done one thing or another differently, you are very deceived. This book was an amazing ending to the trilogy, although I cried and I probably will continue crying for a long while about how this book affected me, you should not let that deter you from reading this final book. Throughout the whole series you see how Tris grows and learns how to become selfless and caring for the people around her. She has done many things in the past without thinking them through, but in this final book you see her become more mature and wise beyond her years. Tobias and Tris have a relationship that is flawed, but even though it is flawed you know that they are good for each other.<br />Spoilers start here:<br />The ending will literally break your heart when Tris dies and Tobias tries to cope with it, but the epilogue will show you that everyone is alright. They each have had to deal with deaths of their friends and family, but they are all working through it. Yes it would have been amazing for Tris and Tobias to be together forever, but not everything has a fairy tale ending, and after all that Tris had done and somehow managed to not die, you knew her luck had to run out eventually.<br />Even though you will be sad in the end, you will be glad you read it, because it did have a satisfying ending.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I so love Divergent and Insurgent and recruited dozens of people who also fell mesmerized by Tris and Four and the factions. Allegiant was also a great book except for killing off Tris. I don't understand it. It doesn't leave us with hope or a new sense of bravery even. She was gunned down by a coward in a wheelchair. Broke my heart. Why kill off the heroine? Why can there be no happy endings anymore. I don't know if I even want to watch the movie now, which I was so excited about. Poor Four. They would've been so good together and affected powerful change. Disappointed.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought this so I could stream Netflix and it works pretty well with the exception of the somewhat frequent glitch. The glitch seems to be more related to my iphone app than to the actual device but since you can't use the device without the app my review is on the entire package.<br />The glitch is a problem with pausing and stopping video. Sometimes it will not let me do either until I completely restart my phone. It likes to freeze in play mode if that makes sense.<br />I still use it and for the price you really can't go wrong. I would say that if you have another way to stream Netflix and YouTube to your television then don't bother with Chromecast. If not, try it out. You may have a better experience than me.

The cord leading from the multiplier's base to the computer is amply long.  The one thing that can be better is more ports.  This multiplier is not very cheap so at least one more port would be good.  The multiplier works with USB 2.0 without a problem.<br /><br />Lastly, to AMAZON ----  There are too many females posting reviews on this section.  Science and technology and other male-only fields should have a limit of 5% women (at most).  95% should be males.  I urge AMAZON to restrict selling of this item to males only.

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Once again the cast was Outstanding.  Watching Pine, Quinto, Pegg, Saldana, Urban and Cho was like watching Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley and the rest of the original members.  The script was good but lacked a bit when it came to the character of Khan. Ricardo Montelban was so emotional and there was that true animosity between he and Captain Kirk, unfortunately that chemistry was not present in this encounter.<br /><br />Overall the film was fun, exciting and suspenseful.  I recommend a blanket, an X-large bucket of popcorn and watch both Star Trek movies.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I'm so disappointed. After having loved the first two books I eagerly awaited this book.<br />Tis book has very little in common with the first two. The character development was flat. The storyline was contrived. And boring. The ending was contrived and felt like Roth was just trying to find the most unlikely ending to say &#34;here you go I'm so cool!&#34; Ugh heartbreakingly BAD! I felt manipulated. Horrible.

B00F1CRSKM|5.0|Like approximately 3 billion other people, I really liked their previous albums, and i was honestly a bit disappointed with this one on the first listen, and even on the second and third. But at some point -- somewhere around the 4th time through It's Never Over/Hey Orpheus,I thought this is actually a pretty great album. The songs tend to run a litter longer than I might like, but there is really a lot going on in this album. It might actually be their best album, but I think I need a few more listens to really start to get a good sense of it.
1452113432|5.0|I read cookbooks like I read any other book, and this was no exception. I have marked about 20 recipes I want to try already. The book not only has the basic recipe but also some information/story to go along with it. I like that they aren't complicated, and most of the ingredients you can find at your local grocery store (a few aren't as easy like rabbit etc). If you like the show you'll like the cookbook!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I actually borrowed this from my folks and ended up buying them a new one after keeping theirs. If you are looking to stream netflix or Youtube from your Ipad to the tv over wifi this is a great little device. I decided not to get cable in my new place and have an hdmi cable hooked up to a computer that I stream most everything from.<br /><br />The freedom of being able to do this from my Ipad using netflix or YouTube is great. I only wish there were more options. I have the old generation Ipad so I think with the new ones you can stream Chrome tabs as well which might end all my issues, but even from the computer there seems to be more delay streaming chrome tabs then there is streaming from the Ipad apps. This would get 7 stars from me if there was just a little more functionality, though i have heard there will likely be more apps jumping on board soon.<br /><br />I threw a house warming and someone mentioned some random YouTube video, the ability to grab my ipad and show the video on the big screen was a HUGE hit and for $35 bucks I think its really hard to go wrong here.<br /><br />You should buy this. Shipping was quick, no hassle, great device.

B001QD5OSS|4.0|I would give it five stars, but it seems some of the history was needlessly sacrificed.  For example, according to what I read, George himself later testified against &#34;Diego&#34; (i.e., Carlos Lehder).  This somewhat contradicts the movie's portrayal of George as the ever-faithful friend who never rolled on anyone (although to be fair, the movie never dealt with Diego's eventual arrest/extradition to the U.S.).  Also, per what I read, George kept dealing even after being cut out by Diego, whereas the movie shows him as going into retirement after Diego's portrayal.  Regardless, great movie!

1449305172|5.0|I read Ash's book after reading his blog posts over the years. His use of analytics and examples are the key to the book for me. If it's the first time you've thought about Lean Startup Methodology, you'll want to sit down and re-read a few sections to make sure the concepts are clear to you. The examples Ash offers are very applied, which means reading a section then developing your own schema for your own product idea. I have all of my new hires read \\"Running Lean\\" so they understand the core techniques of implementing and measuring our new ideas properly. Easily worth the investment of time and money.
1451695195|1.0|What the author writes in this book is not biblically sound.  I've also heard Dr. Alexander himself  state that God has no gender yet the Holy Bible definitely says God the father and always refers to Him as \\"He\\".

0062183613|5.0|Guilty! If you are into behavioral economics, this book is a must read. If you are into expanding your knowledge of human nature, this book is a must read. If you are wanting to improve yourself as a person, well, you get the idea.<br /><br />The one point I kept wanting to argue was with the assumption of moral depletion. The claim is that the more we resist temptation and/or do a good deed, the weaker our willpower becomes later in the day. For example, people who purchased organic food were more prone to cheat on a test (for financial gain). I'm sure there is a good amount of merit to their exhausted morality view, but, I might have offered up one further perspective. The person who purchased organic food may have thought, &#34;I'm a good boy, so now I deserve a reward.&#34; I imagine there are times of moral depletion, but I'd wager there are also times of self justified compensation too.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|OK-- I'm not in the young adult demographic that this series was written for, and I did enjoy the first the first two books of the series?  But-- this book just got tedious to finish.  Too much emphasis on everyone's feelings, back and forth endlessly.  After three books I expected a bigger climax, but it just wasn't there except for the one event that would be a plot spoiler to reveal.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Grew up on this music back when there was a harmony, good lyrics and singers who could sing. What's not to like. Timeless.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Very mild spoilers in this here review.<br /><br />I was super excited about this book, I pre-ordered it the day it was available to do so. I loved the first two books so much and was pumped that the finale was coming.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but i was seriously bored through the middle of the book. I kept saying in my head \\"Again? Really? Fight here, go here hoping it'll be better. Nope, not better! Fight again! Leave again! Better? Nope! Rinse repeat\\" You can only suspend disbelief so much before you just sigh and try to get through the book, hoping something will change the formula that the author seems to think bears repeating over and over. I, too, was confused as to why the author wanted to split up the book between the POV of two characters, when she hadn't done that before - and it really didn't work.<br /><br />And then the ending. *sigh* I don't need happy endings, but this just seemed like a rushed, throwaway ending, slapdash at best. And besides, wouldn't it be nice to give a character that's had a horrible, confusing life a happy ending? Or at least one that isn't going to mess them up even more? There was no reason for the end outcome, none at all.<br /><br />I still devoured the book, even while slogging through the middle. And i can't resist more stories about Tris and Tobias. Sadly, the short stories she's putting out about Four are far more fleshed out than this book was. I would like to give it 2 1/2 stars, but I'll just go ahead and go with 3.

B00F30S0Y0|5.0|This new album is everything I hoped for and with each listen I am more impressed. It's only my first day listening to it and I know it will only get better and better.<br /><br />Reflektor has James Murphy written all over it and that is something I can truly get behind. The danceable beats of James Murphy mixed with the raw yet relatable storytelling of Arcade Fire creates an album at it's finest here, folks.<br /><br />No doubt that Arcade Fire is constantly changing with each new album, they manage to evolve without losing their signature sound. I will be recommending this album to all of my friends and family.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|I picked this book up at the local bookstore. I haven't read from an actual book in years because of my kindle. I read it in one day, not a usual thing for me either. I am a Christian, but have had issues with my faith since losing my mom last December. I found this book leaving me to want more info about NDE and heaven itself. I was a bit disappointed in his referral to God as Om, but I am not to judge. I felt a major connection to him when he told his story about being adopted for I was as well. We share many of the same feelings that I have struggled with. I am glad I did not read the reviews until after I read the book because it gave me a clear picture of his story. I do know now that there was more to the story in regard to his depression, but what does any of that have to do with the story he was trying to tell? Even though we have different understandings it seems to lead to the same result...God is Love and he deeply loves us more than we can fathom. I would recommend this book!

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this thought-provoking book.  However, I had a little trouble keeping the characters straight, since the chapters each tell the story from a different perspective.  I kept thinking all the way through the book what I would do if faced with the same situation, and I honestly don't know the answer.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I've not been much of a fan of the young adult genre lately. The last few YA books I read were superficial and unappealing and just out me off the entire genre. I was in a YA slump and it was my own fault. I've been promising myself I would read this for the better part of a year, but I kept putting it off. Who would have thought within the first couple of pages I would be in love with this book? Not me, that's for sure.<br /><br />Did anyone catch how much Anna's dad sounded like Nicholas Sparks? Was the author insulting NS intentionally? Almost every Nicholas Sparks book ends with one of the man characters dead, and usually from a life threatening disease. His books have become the quentisential cliche of the romance world and that's pretty much Anna's dad right there.<br /><br />I'm in love with Anna. She's witty and sarcastic; she's just my kind of gall. I liked St. Claire as well, but if wanted to knock him around a bit for the way he played Anna from the beginning. He didn't make her any promises, but it was noticeable how attracted he was for her. He didn't even make a move to brake up with his girlfriend until Anna exploded and made it pretty known how much she cared about him. Maybe it was logical for him to wait until he knew without a doubt she liked him as much as he liked her, but it was also cowardly. In the end he pretty much redeemed himself when he admitted he was an idiot, so I forgave him. Mostly. It helps that he's just so dang cute.<br /><br />I liked that neither Anna nor St. Claire were perfect. In fact, none of these characters are. Stephanie Perkins did a great job of writing an accurate story that a reader would want to read. Hell, I wanted to go to this school! The plot was enjoyable, the characters were addicting, and the email interactions were just plain fun. I would so re-read this (in fact, I've already done so once) and recommend it to any fan of YA contemporary romance.

B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|Five POTENT Stars! Beautiful, swinging, smooth, vocal R&B music with a modal jazz underpinning. Robert Glasper is the award-winning pianist, composer, leader, and producer who is not just crossing over from jazz to other forms of contemporary music, he's pulling down walls by blending jazz, hip-hop, R&B, gospel, and beyond, creating a form of music probably more at home on 'quiet storm' radio stations than jazz stations (for the time being). On his groundbreaking, Grammy-winning [[ASIN:B0067Q04AM Black Radio]], he raised the stakes of the preceding [[ASIN:B002GSO3M0 Double Booked]], which had 6 tracks played by his jazz trio and 6 tracks of hip-hop played by his Black Radio Experiment group, to a complete recording of this transformative new music. He continues this trend with a complete recording of R&B-influenced performances on Black Radio 2. In his DownBeat magazine cover story on this new music, he thought about bringing in lesser known artists for the second Black Radio recording. Instead he has brought in some of the 'cream of the crop' of urban contemporary music, who are very much at ease in Glasper's musical world and vice versa: Macy Gray, Common, Jill Scott, Faith Evans, Marsha Ambrosius, Brandy, Snoop Dogg, Lupe Fiasco, and Norah Jones, among many others.<br /><br />The entire 16 track recording is uniformly excellent with songs flowing from one song to the next, creating a beautiful mellow laid-back sonic mood. My favorites begin with the uplifting performance of \\"You're My Everything\\" featuring Bilal and Jazmine Sullivan and the gospel-flavored piano enhancing a declarative rap by Common on \\"I Stand Alone\\". \\"Big Girl Body' featuring Eric Roberson has a beautiful background musical theme but with some chilling predictive environmental words. Then there is the heartfelt uptempo \\"Let It Ride\\" with a multi-tracked Norah Jones; the sole 'cover' of this recording is an updated auto-tuned vocal version of Bill Withers' \\"Lovely Day\\"; Macy Gray and Jean Grae join forces on \\"I Don't Even Care\\"; Snopp Dogg, Lupe Fiasco, and Luke James are wonderful on the positive rap \\"Persevere\\"; there is a towering performance of \\"Yet To Find\\" by Anthony Hamilton; \\"Jesus Children\\" features the lovely voice of Lalah Hathaway and Malcolm Jamal Warner's inspiring spoken words, and finally there is the 'flo-etry' of Marsha Ambrosius on a mesmerizing \\"Trust\\". In all, this is another major step by Robert Glasper, his Experiment band, and musical guests in adding to his potent personal take on the urban contemporary music experience on this more R&B-flavored performance and it is a complete, highly enjoyable success. Highly Recommended! Five COMPELLING Stars!

B00BD99JMW|1.0|UPDATE:<br />I was about halfway through the book when I wrote this initial review. I was already unhappy with it but I forced myself to continue and finish Allegiant. Without a doubt this is the most ill conceived and poorly written book that I have ever read. And I read a LOT of books.<br /><br />I don't ordinarily feel compelled to write reviews unless I think a book is exceptionally good or horribly bad. I was a latecomer to Divergent and absolutely LOVED the first two volumes, but I was waiting to finish the series so I could heap praise on the author and give all three books the most glowing review that I was capable of writing. So much for THAT plan.<br /><br />I think that Ms Roth lost interest in the story but she was under the gun to meet a deadline.  If she missed that deadline her little kingdom would begin to crumble. Praise for the first two books came so abundantly and easily that I imagine she thought she could just breeze through this third one and be done. After all, she had the MOVIE and all it's glorious MONEY to focus on. At the last minute she realized that her writing was SO bad that the fans were going to notice. She had to do something for shock value so maybe we'd forget the horrible writing - thus the ridiculous ending.<br /><br />Wild horses couldn't drag me to the movie - that is IF it still gets made. What a horrible disappointment this book was!  In fact I thought it was SO BAD that I had Amazon remove it from my Kindle and give me my money back. I'm sorry now that I ever started reading the trilogy. It'll be a while before I start another series - no matter who the author is.<br /><br />  --------------------------<br />Initial Review:<br /><br />I read and loved the other books and spent what seemed like forever happily anticipating the publication of this one.  I haven't finished it yet because I just can't get into it. It doesn't even seem to be written by the same author. I suppose she's using both Tris' and Four's voices to compare and contrast their thoughts and feelings - but in doing so (in my opinion) she has lost BOTH voices.  I can't tell them apart until whichever one is currently speaking mentions something that identifies who it is.  I know their names are at the beginning of each chapter but that's so forgettable when they sound identical.<br /><br />Plus, the plot seems to be recycling and going nowhere fast. I've never before given up in the middle of a book but I've already been SO disappointed - and judging by some of the other reviews I can't see it getting better - that this may be the one book that I give up on.re and contrast their thoughts and feelings - but in doing so (in my opinion) she has lost BOTH voices.

006202406X|5.0|I know a lot of reader's may have been disappointed in the ending of this series, but I for one, was not.

Roth has taken these children, who were never really allowed to be children, and evolved them into these powerful beings.  They suffer loss, pain, love, betrayal and more loss to the point that as with the characters in the book, she's taken us on this emotional journey of true self awareness that is nothing short of stunning.  Allegiant, isn't a sentimental farewell, it is a force of nature, annihilating the will of the readers desire for an ending with a neat pretty little bow.  Allegiant, is real and best of all, complete,  That's all any reader should want at the end of such an emotionally commanding series.  To those who have yet to read this last book I say, Be brave.<br /><br />Oh, and get a box of tissue.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Never understood what everyone saw in this game until I played my first game and was hooked. you won't be able to stop!!

1449305172|4.0|This is a must Read for Lean Entrepreneurs. Whether you are just starting up, starting fresh or investigating the concepts, Ash makes it all come together in this action oriented book.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I read this book because I had grown up with the Hollywood movie with Judy Garland (which I loved).  I actually enjoyed the real story by Frank Baum as much as I enjoy the Hollywood version.  It's a wonderful read for old and young alike.

B0083Z6AH6|4.0|So maybe I'm odd,,,but I like to read the old classic novels at bedtime.  Slows me down a bit and puts my mind in a lovely place - sets me up for a peaceful night.  This book is what you'd expect - the old English drama.  Very enjoyable.
039916409X|5.0|Margaret is brilliant at what she does.  My dear friend and I did one of her programs tapping through the chakras and clearing vows.  We both broke free of our old paradigm around money and abundance and our lives have both changed dramatically as a result.  How wonderful that you can get to know Margaret and experience life changing transformation through her book and videos.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm hooked on this series!  Great actors, great plot, beautiful costuming and scenery!  So convenient to switch on Yahoo instant play when I want to catch an episode I missed.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I just got this book this morning via kindle. I thought I'd take a quick peek via the website at what I bought (holding off on immediately opening things I bought, recieved or otherwise obtained is NOT one of my strong points. I would make a very shitty postman). Of course, a few hours later, here I am at work, having done nothing of the list of things that have been overdue since last week, and still very happy I spent my morning this way.<br /><br />There's a fair few bits of the blog coming back (although it's mostly the ones I was happy to re-read due to either being so brainnumbingly good I just delighted in them, or one of the few bits I haven't re-read a million times already), but a substantial part of the book is entirely new stuff.<br /><br />And the new stuff is GOOOOOD. If you, like any reasonable person (and quite a few certifiable people) loved her insights on depression and the problems arising when little boys and/or girls get mistaken for grown-ups just because they've been around on this earth for a few decades, you'll love her new stuff. Her ruthless disection of the many ways in which her ideal of herself is not anywhere near the person she is, is something we can all relate to.<br /><br />And if you don't struggle for breath from laughter at the dog Q&A, I don't know what to tell you, except that you might be even more horrible of a person than Allie is.<br /><br />So, to finish off: one question for the author. From my stupid cat.<br />Q: Srsly, why never bees?
B00271DNP4|5.0|Wonderful books - wonderful movies.  I've seen and read all - multiple times.  I'm a middle-aged lady with grown kids & grandkids.  This series appeals to all age levels.  Highly recommend the series of both for some good, enchanted entertainment.

B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book is a well-loved classic in our home.  Not only did my mother and I read it out loud to each other when I was a young girl, but I read it with my own daughter during her pre-teen years.  Like Anne of Green Gables, I ended up collecting the entire series read them and passed it onto my daughter.  It's innocent and pure and just a lovely story.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|DVD  is ok.  It did not keep us interested in watching the entire movie.  First Sandra bullock movie we did not<br />complete.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|Whether your primary interest is history, sociology, anthropology, politics...or any of the social sciences, this novel should spark your analytical and creative instincts.  Mitchell's linguistic gymnastics can be unique or at times reminiscent of the best in classic literature.  This is a novel to be read, discussed, and reread because there will always be something you missed.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|even my 'pop-rock' sisters enjoy this cd. They sound like angels and the music is beautiful. One of my favorite cds!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this one I started. I took it to work and school and snatched up pages of reading whenever I could. Dan and Abby are interesting and very believable characters, as well as the other newcomers. Loved every minute of it and ends just the way it should. A must read!!

B00DOPEGAS|1.0|I purchased this from a local Toys R' Us along with many colors of bands. I had been unable to find the original Rainbow Loom for quite a while, so went with this instead. Wish I had not. Instructions use the post numbers to tell you where to put the bands, where to hook the bands to, etc. Since posts are not numbered on the loom, it was difficult to follow. Even more difficult when there are mistakes in the instructions. I decided to take a fine tip Sharpie marker and number the posts myself to try to make it less difficult. Unfortunately, that has now made it so that I can't return this.<br /><br />The hook itself it too bulky to use when you try more than a beginner bracelet. The Rainbow Loom pegs have a better ridge that helps keep the bands on the loom. This loom has a very small area that you hope keeps the bands from popping off. Don't hope....just figure they won't stay on. All in all - very inferior product.<br /><br />Of course, the next day, my local Michael's store had an entire display of Rainbow Looms. I happily purchased that and have already retired the Toys 'R Us loom.
B00BW5K5DO|2.0|I really liked this game except every time I get to a new island it wants me to pay again for the full game. I have payed twice.  Will not be purchasing another game from Playrix!!!!!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|fun! wish seasonal updates didnt come out so late for the fire leaving only 2 days to complete them. or rely on Device storage instead of cloud based game save.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive. I'm glad that it is now available on Kindle because it was forever ago when my friends started playing and I wanted to do but didn't have it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. When one question feels answered, three more pop up! I will be reading the next one.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|It is not a bad game. it keeps you occupied for quite a while. I really enjoy playing it after a long day at work. takes my mind off everything.
B00CL151G4|3.0|okay this show is awesome... I love it, it really does bring in a lot from the original stories... he will even say direct quotes from the books... and I can watch these episodes over and over... my complaint is that they don't have the play all feature that lets you just play straight through the DVD... instead you have to keep going back to play the next episode... it's irritating to say the least...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Challenging at the most. Anticipation in completing a level is accelerating. Can't look put the the game down. And you hate to wait for the lives to fill so you can play again.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Great show! Very well written. A must watch. A little gory at times but worth the time. Love the fact that I can stream this for free on amazon prime.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As a trial lawyer from a rural southern area, I felt compelled to write a review (I've never done so before) to share my observation that Grisham's behind the scenes description of the life of a lawsuit is uncannily accurate.  At times I felt as though he was describing my personal experiences.  What trial lawyer out there hasn't had their client destroyed on the stand at least once by some \\"minor\\" detail the client somehow forgot to mention?  How many times have I swung from adoration to revile of a local judge? Those critical because of loose ends or unrealistic plot turns forget that in real life, we lawyers do not have the luxury of changing the facts to make our cases easier to win.  Grisham's descriptions sometimes made me laugh out loud in the way he captures the closed-rank feeling of a small town courthouse, particularly when the out of town lawyers in their $1000.00 suits swagger in.  I enjoyed every minute of this book and, guilty as charged, found myself wanting to interrupt Lucian or Harry with ego driven war stories of my own.  Kudos for capturing the genuine essence, JG!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters in Downton Abbey have become like family to me. I can't wait to see what happens in Season 4!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|If you're looking for a beefy knife that will hold up to everything you can throw at it.....this is the one. It is all it says and more. Some of the videos I watched reviewing this knife were a little biased in my eyes. The weight some people say is a problem that holds them down, I found with the right 2&#34; belt it doesn't. If you don't have or want to spend 100's or even more the $50 on a real good knife, do yourself a favor and buy this one. You won't be sorry......plus the sheath isn't that bad for a $40 knife!!!!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved the history and the research that was present. Also the lesson of how southern courts actually worked was presented in a super suspenseful way.

Now, I get validation, and even presells before any coding is performed. Thanks Ash!

B0065GC0BA|5.0|I started last night and finished early hours of the morning, its one of THOSE books.  at the end i slowed down, so that it wouldnt end as fast. i have been referring to it in conversation, people are going to tell me to shut up about it shortly.  Lou and Will seem so real to me, its going to take a few days to settle in after i think.<br />if your considering reading it, just stop.  get it. read it. love it. the end.
B000I55YV2|5.0|Never a boring moment.  Never know exactly what action is about to happen,  Hot Adrenaline pumping, non stop action.  I can't get enough.

B0013TXA5Y|3.0|It's a good read but just not my reading level. I can definitely understand why a teen would like it.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|Great movie. Would be a five star movie however I feel like ending could have explained a little more about the plot. Not disappointing, just left me with questions.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|If you loved the first book, you will enjoy this one too. I will definitely read the third book in the trilogy.
B00FPH6A70|4.0|It had some pretty creepy parts and kept me on the edge of my seat most the movie. I wish you did not have to purchase the movie to watch it though. Not a movie I will watch enough times to make the only option (to purchase not rent) worth it in my opinion.
1594202273|5.0|A great exposition of the whys, whats, whens, wheres , problems and frightening dangers of atomic weapons. The most frightening book I've ever read. It should by read by every governing person in Washington plus by millions of Americans and those in all the other countries owning atomic weapons and those aspiring to and more.. To repeat -We must all learn to live together or we will all die together--from the atomic bomb. And I'm afraid the 2nd possibility is too possible.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|This game is good for kids but why do we have to pay 100 bucks for 250 gems? I want to have fun with this game and not spend  so much stupid gems. This game is for kids. So game loft, why so greedy?!
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|First I'm glad he gave kerbal props since it obviously inspired this game.  Now the game itself.  Its a simple game and certainly could use some more depth.  Not tons more but more.  Its easy to build rockets and fly them but it would be nice of the camera had more control and view options.<br /><br />The graphics are simple but effective and it runs just fine on my aging galaxy nexus.  If this wasn't today's FAOTD I would have bought it had I known it existed.  Its a cool distraction for all ages and you really can't go wrong here.  Nice work dev.<br /><br />Oh before I forget,  thank you so much for not loading the app with insane permissions.  Its nice to see not all developers are info stealing scum and I happily support people like you.  Once this app isn't free I'm going to buy this.  You deserve the sale.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Really enjoy this game. You can get pretty far without having to purchase anything with real money but once you advance a bit, the progress slows down. Getting the &quot;jewels&quot; to purchase some of the fun animals and better houses is very difficult if you don't want to pay. Even so, it is still a lot of fun if a bit slow moving.
B003O97W5K|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! It's the scariest PG movie I've ever seen. Finally a movie I could watch with my sisters kids that's scary and appropriate.
B00F146GYE|5.0|The Castlevania video game series has been alive and kicking (and in some cases one might say \\"screaming\\") since its initial eponymous title was released in 1986. Though polarizing opinions exist about the quality of some of the series' titles to date, one thing that cannot be called into question is the legacy of Castlevania's music across all its various platforms and consoles. In most cases catchy, sometimes captivating, and let's face it, perpetually and resoundingly cool, the music of the Castlevania franchise has evolved from the MIDI keyboards of 1986 to the full orchestra of 2010's Lords of Shadow. Along the way, fans have borne witness to such spellbinding classics as the scores to, among others, 1991's Super Castlevania IV, 1997's Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, 2001's Castlevania: Circle of the Moon, and 2003's Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow. But aside from the repeat appearance of such songs as \\"Bloody Tears\\" and \\"Vampire Killer,\\" there are few central themes to Castlevania's music, and the scores' structures in many cases mirror the stage-based gameplay of its various entries. Lords of Shadow changes all that, setting a new bar for Castlevania and its future music despite a seemingly large departure from the series' gothic influence.<br /><br />What Spanish composer Oscar Araujo has done with Lords of Shadow, finally being properly released on CD by Sumthing Else Music Works, is truly remarkable. Though the Lords of Shadow game has been criticized by some for its abandonment of both thematic material and hat-tipping to Castlevania games of yore, Araujo's score almost singlehandedly provides for a new and yet classic Castlevania experience to fans both old and new. In place of mutually exclusive tunes, Araujo has crafted overarching themes for Lords of Shadow, from the majestic bombast of \\"Hunting Path\\" and \\"The Ice Titan\\" to the delicate, heart-wrenching beauty of \\"Waterfalls of Agharta\\" and \\"Maze Gardens.\\" His music aurally writhes in conjunction with the twisting and turning plight of protagonist Gabriel Belmont, on a quest to revive his deceased wife Marie, as it splashes color and emotion both striking and anxious to haunting effect. Araujo's use of masterful orchestral sound, no better exemplified than with his forays into male and female choral-driven melodies and thundering percussion, adds a palpable bleed to the story it accompanies, thrusting the plot to epic proportions with an almost obvious ease. Tracks like \\"The Swamp Troll\\" and \\"The God Mask\\" advance with beautiful causality to amazing conclusion, wrapping up string and horn fanaticism to Hollywood blockbuster heights, nearly giving Lords of Shadow a sheen of unforgiving reality. Album closers \\"The End,\\" \\"Love Lost / The Final Battle,\\" and \\"Ascension\\" gild Araujo's score with an emotive shroud originating both in serenity and tumult, wholly effective in their relaying of Belmont's ultimate destiny and the terrible truth of his existence.<br /><br />The compositional skill Oscar Araujo displays on Lords of Shadow is outstanding. Scoring a Castlevania effort is challenging at best, and carries with it a monumental set of expectation. But as a lifelong Castlevania series fan, I can say with complete confidence that Araujo has helped to usher in a rebirth of the Castlevania series and its music, with a hugely successful score that's simply one of the best of its generation. Missing this towering work would be inane and completely ridiculous to be sure.<br /><br />Note: Sumthing Else Music Works' release of \\"Lords of Shadow Ultimate Edition\\" is identical to the 2010 game's Collector's Edition soundtrack, except that it contains the bonus tracks \\"Intro\\" and \\"Ascension,\\" an additional 6:44 of material. Sumthing Else Music Works' website ([...] is offering 20 additional tracks for digital download, not featured on the CD release, totaling 33:16.the twisting and turning plight of protagonist Gabriel Belmont, on a quest to revive his deceased wife Marie, as it splashes color and emotion both striking and anxious to haunting effect.

0525478817|4.0|I enjoyed this book even though it was depressing. I know a lot of people say teens don't talk like this, but there are some things John Green wrote that teens do say. It doesn't matter anyways if he wrote the way many teens do talk no one would like it. I don't think the book is five star worthy, but I'd recommend it to people. :)

B00A8MGLAI|1.0|Amazingly bad and way too long, almost 3 hours.<br /><br />An ok future movie (fighting + copy of soilent green) with 5 more bad movies attached to it. Totally understood what they were trying to do after the first 30 minutes, but . . . Matrix it was not.<br /><br />Typical Communist propaganda film by people who refuse to believe in GOD, but . . . evangelize the pagan \\"hand me down soul\\", you call it Karma, so by some miracle of Darwin, you get reincarnated in male and female bodies to carry out your love life that was rudely interrupted by you either killing yourself or getting murdered.<br /><br />Then the obligatory deprecating treatment of slaves, with the honorable slave and all those bad white people. It would have been just as historically accurate to have white people play a slave or 2. The only whipping was black on black crime, how did that get in there?<br /><br />And of course the newest movie \\"requirement for funding\\" the enlightened, creative, but slightly flawed, homosexual.<br /><br />Pornographic scenes and lots of blood, lend nothing to the story. Then there was the supposed comic relief of violently throwing a guy off a building. White guy of course.<br /><br />Corporations bad. Working bad. Consumerism bad. The perfect humans, Darwin's master race, is where everyone is of mixed race origin. In the future the only white people will be primitives speaking pigeon English. Except for the privileged few, like Tom Hanks who get carried away to a distant planet.<br /><br />No politically correct topics left to cover. All that was missing was the hammer and sickle flag at the beginning. If you have some communist friends, send them this movie, it might make them see how ridiculous their religion is.<br /><br />Acting___________7 out of 10.<br />Special effects____9 out of 10.<br />Makeup_________7 out of 10.<br />Story___________3 out of 10.<br />Probability_______2 out of 10.<br />Worth 3 hours____1 out of 10.<br /><br />At least it was free on HBO.

B000002JSP|4.0|Quite different than previous albums from Led Zeppelin but I like the breadth that has elements of reggae, rockabilly, and a badass lead off In the Evening in the more traditional style of Presence or PhysGraf. Even some pop tunes like Fool in the Rain and All My Love which have elements of punk. Carouselambra is a little hard to pin down. Still interesting.

B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Angry Birds Star WarsII works great on my kindle fire. No matter your age if you like this type of game you will like the challenge of trying to get 3stars in each level. wish there was an easy cheat tho. sometimes I cant get 3stars.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is the best game ever I think you'll love it to so get it and get the Tyrannosaurus Rex well that is my goal.

1449305172|5.0|This is the perfect follow up to The Lean Startup. You were introduced to the theory, Ash now guides you through applying it.<br /><br />The book provides a very detailed and pragmatic approach:<br />- customer interviews will first help you tackle the riskiest assumptions and make sure you have a problem worth solving<br />- you'll then use prototypes and more interviews to verify that your solution solves the problem correctly<br />- later you'll use smoke tests and MVPs to validate other parts of your business model such as pricing or distribution channel<br /><br />Not only is Running Lean useful but it's also a nice read. Ash runs you through launching his own business using the method he advocates. He also explains how he wrote this book using Lean Startup principles to verify market traction all along the way.<br /><br />Beware of one thing though: Don't stay stuck in interview scripts and miss precious opportunities to learn even more from your customers. Sometimes the problems they care the most about are those you didn't mention. Sometimes they'll tell you a lot more when you let them go free form. At the end of the day you have to find your own style. Ash teaches you how to start, you'll have to refine his approach to your needs.

B00EMGUT1I|1.0|Howdy ho folks! I love me metal just like the next guy but lately, these Mortorhead band seems to get much attention.  I have never really heard of them before this debut album but I did give it a few spins and was disgusted by Lenny's vocals.  I'm telling you Lenny Kravitz is not a very good vocalist and this album is pure proof of it.  I think I am going to lay off rock and metal for a while because the genre seems to be dying... we need another Nu-Metal revolution...<br /><br />For good metal just stick with Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Atreyu.......
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Object of the game isn't difficult. However, trying to beat it in the amount of tries and moves you get make this a challenging brain exercise! Addicting to say the least because you are determined to beat the level! Sometimes creates a lot of pop up in the search window for the iPhone though.
B008JFUR10|1.0|Watched this movie stoned out of my mind and even then was thoroughly disappointing with the quality of the character to character dialog. I was face palming the entire movie. How much more stereotypical could the asian chick get? timid, quiet, and deadly.....pffft The only good part of this movie was the visuals, it was like a nicely decorated pile of s*** c:
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Sorry, not my cup of tea.  Sexual predators like Christian Grey only deflower supposed 21 year old virgins.  He would not be interested in pursuing a relationship with her.  And yes ladies, men like Christian Grey do exist out there. Don't need to read the other books can guess how it ends (happily ever after following much heartbreak and soul searching).
1401308201|5.0|Contains tons of photos, lots of interviews, and story synopsis that includes all the song lyrics.  Wonderful way to recapture the many amazing moments of this fabulous musical.  Love it.

B00BC0JI6O|5.0|backround: aging boomer revisiting prog after a long sojurn to jazz, fusion, classic rock. over the past year or so have been listening to porcupine tree/steven wilson, dream theater, john petrucci...had heard of spock's beard but hadn't given them a listen till recently. over the past few months have obtained most of their collection, and i'd rank this one as my favorite. also enjoy X and Snow. there have been personel changes over the years like most bands, but again i think this latest album is at the top. i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to any spock's beard fans or fans of intelligent prog rock in general.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|The entire movie is mostly Brad Pitt running around trying to find a solution to the Zombie virus outbreak. The problem is that it's not executed very well. Each person he meets babbles about something random and then goes on to tell him that \\"the princess is in another castle\\". So finally he sets out to the next location to find the origin of the virus so he can stop it. Along the way in his search he realizes something about the attacking zombie herds that leads him to have a stroke of genius that will help him find a way to save humanity.<br /><br />This movie is mostly CGI zombies and the other usual Hollywood special effects. I don't know what it was exactly about this movie but nothing worked for me. Brad Pitt isn't exactly someone I think off when I think Zombie, and to make matters worse he looks completely out of place here. His cookie cutter family doesn't match him, his pretty boy persona in a world gone to the dogs doesn't match him, and his serious/stale acting style just doesn't fit the movie. This guys delivery could never make me think he's in any danger. No matter what situation you get, you always end up with the poker face Brad Pitt. Is he happy? Is he Scared? Is he angry? I don't know he uses the same expression and delivery for all those emotions. It's not Brad Pitt's fault this movie doesn't fit him though, this film is pretty predictable and bland to begin with. Aside from seeing Zombies pile up to form ladders that's about all that's new. The theory of stopping the zombies has been done before in other horror movies. This is the first time I think I've seen it done with Zombies though.<br /><br />The thing that doesn't make this film work though is that aside from the cheesy CGI zombies (which are so unbelievably obvious I thought I this was a PS3 game), the movie lacks the Zombie feel to it. It just feels like your typical action movie. It's more Action/Science Fiction than it is Horror. This is adapted from a book that I haven't read so I'm not sure the direction these zombies are supposed to go in. With Zombies it can be anything. They used to be Supernatural and the dead coming back to life, then people started to try to make it believable and added in the toxic chemical theories and then the virus theories which takes it from being supernatural horror to science fiction. This is kind of like \\"I am Legend\\" with the scientific approach to understanding and solving the issue.<br /><br />For me the movie fell apart when Brad Pit meets a certain group of folks that are nestled away working on a solution. They are all so clean cut,mentally together, and nonchalant about what's going on that it only reminds you how poorly executed this movie is in trying to make you feel like the Zombie outbreak has ended the world as we know it.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this movie is just a way to kill time. I actually paused it to run errands for a few hours then came back to it. It was that engaging! I'm not surprised though I rarely find myself enjoying Brad Pit movies. It's not that I dislike him or his acting, the roles he takes are never in movies that interests me. This seemed more like a Tom Cruise role I could see him playing the lead and actually making it interesting even if the dialogue is bland.not sure the direction these zombies are supposed to go in.

B008FQ1O1K|3.0|The theme of the book is love which is same as the book &#34; Tuesday with Morrie&#34;. He adds the new technology - cryogenics. The story is told from different parts of world under different circumstance and how to survive, thrive the problems of emotional survive. At the end it is love will be tested in the final phrase- love is the one that will sustain us.

B000LTAY1U|4.0|PROS:<br />  Inexpensive watch that offers Day of Week and Calendar Day, that is an automatic motion.<br />  The crown is offset to the 4 o'clock position, which keeps it from digging into my hand.<br />  Lightweight, i sometimes forget i'm wearing the watch.<br />  Automatic movement, so i don't need to worry about batteries.<br />  The numbers on the watch show the hours and the minutes depending on how you read the watch:<br /><br />CONS:<br />  The watch only has approximately 24 shelf life before it needs to be worn again. If i take it off when i go to bed, wear a different watch the second day, when i put this watch on my wrist the third morning, i have to reset the time.<br />  I'm not a huge fan of fabric bands, and thinking of replacing it with a metal bracelet.<br /><br />Overall:<br />  This is a fantastic Every Day Carry watch.  If i could only buy one watch for under $75, i would buy this again in heartbeat.
0307352145|5.0|The book was recommended by a business professor, and exceeded my expectations. The balance between research and examples made it an easy read with tons of good information, and support for anyone with an introverted personality. Even the extroverts should read this to gain a better understanding of introverts.

B009RX85N0|4.0|The second season of Once Upon a Time got off to a great start with Emma getting sucked into the Enchanted Forest and Snow deciding to go in after her. I was so glad it picked up with them remembering who they were and it was great to see the Charming family reunited even if it was only for five minutes. I enjoyed watching Henry and Charming bonding while trying to get Emma and Snow back. I also enjoyed Snow and Emma's trip through the Enchanted Forest, for someone who wasn't much of a believer it was fun to see Emma's reaction to things in the Enchanted Forest. It was nice to see what happened to the land when the Curse happened and those who were left behind. Cora proved to be an excellent villain and I loved her teaming up with Hook. The first half seemed to be right on track and heading in a direction. It was so wonderful watching the family reunite when Emma and Snow came back.<br />Unfortunately for me once they got back things began to go south in the terms of storytelling. Its like they were trying to jam pack so much stuff into it. And all of it didn't make any sense. Starting with Regina deciding she was going to be good for Henry's sake and because she loved him. This is all well and  good, it was fun to see her attempted to be a better person and I enjoyed her therapy sessions with Archie. But once Cora returned Regina switched back far too quickly and I'm not even sure why. Maybe she wanted Henry back but she all ready knew Henry wouldn't come back to her as long as she was being evil. Also the fact Regina never question Cora's motives in helping. Regina knows her mother, its hard to believe she would so willingly go back to her without at least wondering if her mother had alternative moments. Same goes with the audience because Cora died before we ever found out whether or not she had something up her sleeve.<br />  Cora's death happened by Snow White, who then felt guilty and even in the season finale says she took the easy way out. How is murdering the person who was going to murder your family and you taking the easy way out? I'll admit I was very interested when Snow White decided she had enough of losing her family and decided she was going to do something about it. This would have been very interesting, for one thing she has every reason to be angry and it would have been more bold on the writer's part then having her kill Cora then feel bad about it.<br />  Next up Rumple finds his son, after spending centuries plotting and manipulating everyone and everything to find his son, Rumple finds Bae in New York. He tries to make amends and Bae didn't want too. Fair enough but he does come back to Storybrooke when his father almost dies. You would think after this, something would happen. Nope. Once Bae is in Storybrooke they barely even interact, so Rumple does all  of this to end up in the same town as his son, and that's it? I don't think so writers.<br />  I hate Neal.  I'm sorry I tired but I hate him. I'm suppose to believe this is Emma's true love? He set her up to go to jail because<br />Pinocchio told him to, this forced her to give up her son, he runs away from her in New York, when Henry's being a brat to Emma about lying to him about his father he never brings up the fact he sent her to jail,  he does nothing to make up for the fact he put her in jail, he was engaged to another woman, he failed to mention his engagement to Emma, when Emma brings up her suspicions about Tamara for which she is correct about he acts as if its because she's still in love with him, he's a real keeper Emma. It was very uncomfortable watching her declare her love for him seconds before he fell through a portal despite not seeing one sign on her part that she was still in love with him or any sign from him that he loved her. He was still engaged two seconds before she declared her love.<br />  A giant and the Dwarves grow beans so they can return to home. Not one discussion on whether or not going back it is worth it? Do they all want to go back? No one wants to stay in Storybrooke? Snow and Charming are excited to go back home with their family, odd since I didn't get the impression during all of Season two that Emma ever wanted to go back to the Enchanted Forest. Regina overhears and is angry that they don't want her to come with. The real question is why is she surprised? Why would Snow and Charming want her to come with after everything she's put them through. Regina if your going to be an evil queen, be an evil queen, if you want to change, change. But its stupid how the writers kept flipping her around she does evil things but can't understand why no one likes her. Her plan? To kidnap Henry and kill everyone in Storybrooke. Great idea, I  am sure Henry will love that. So she decides to use her fail safe plan, except Greg and Tamara steal it and set it off instead. The only one who can save the town is Regina. It may or may not work Regina actually does the smart thing by telling Emma to get Henry, take the bean and get everyone out of there. That is a good idea but the plan gets thrown out by Snow and Charming, and somehow everyone else is convinced this is a good idea. Despite the fact it could kill them all. Please give Snow and Charming a brain in Season three please. I know Regina's not going to die, but its so stupid to listen to Snow and Charming think its a good idea to risk the entire town to save her.<br />  Regina lives. With Emma's help. But Henry gets abducted by Greg and Tamara. Who are Greg and Tamara, the worse villains<br />in Once a Upon a Time not because they were amazingly evil but mostly because they were just terrible. Greg should have been easier to sympathize with because Regina ruined his life, expect the actor was so bad you found yourself not caring. Greg and Tamara apparently work for some Home Office and they want to destroy magic. Fine, that's something and they are about to do so when they suddenly get a call from their boss to kidnap Henry and takehim to Neverland. Really writers you don't see where you went wrong there? Your magic hating villains are going to Neverland.<br />  Back to the good parts. I liked seeing what happened to Bae when he was sucked into the portal and ended up with the Darlings. I liked seeing more of Rumple's backstory, Cora's backstory, and Belle was good up until the part where she was Lacey.<br />Snow White and her mother, more backstory on Red, and finding out who Dr. Whale was. But it would have been nice to see more backstories of other characters, it would have been nice to see more of the other characters in Storybrooke more of Archie, Red, the Dwarves. It would have been fun to find out who else was in Storybrooke.<br />  One last thing I don't know if they get praised enough but the person or people who does the costuming is amazing. From Regina's elaborate evil queen dresses, to little Snow's dresses, Cora's dresses, Belle's, they do a wonderful job on each costume they create.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Disk in perfect condition as well as the case! Shipping and handling could have been cheaper but over all an amazing buy!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is really fun, but it would be better if you had more lives and didn't have to pay real money for upgrades.
0156528207|5.0|It's quiet, it's understated, it's simple; but not simplistic.  It deals adroitly with great issues, yet puts them in a context the is instantly understandable.  How a Man's Man of a French Aristocrat, Mail BiPlane flying adventurer came to create such a Masterpiece is a matter of confounding joy!
B008N9AAQ4|3.0|This was a fun movie and a HD gem.  Excellent cinematography.  Maybe not as metaphysical as the previous films by the same director, but still awe inspiring and creates a deep personal connection.
0062238868|5.0|Well written novel by a true American hero. This was the first book like this that I have ever read (I'm usually into chick lit) and I couldn't put it down. Such a shame that someone with PTSD killed him.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Okay, I do not have to have happy endings. In fact, sometimes I don't even want them. Sometimes I want a cry. This book did not make me cry, it did not give me a lump, I was ticked. Four, a character that I loved for his giant cojones in the first two books was sniveling and insecure. I barely recognized him. And the epilogue, for him to be left like that, basically a college dropout living with mommy? Seriously?  Tris, if there was no other choice, if it would have added to the quality of the character, the society, or have been in any way at all necessary, I would have been okay with her fate. There were so many other options here. I felt like it was a cheap shot for shock value. And what the deuce happened to the story line??? The entire series was building up to a faction and faction-less war. Instead, the author went with a completely different dystopian story line...genetically damaged and genetically pure? I felt like I was reading a different book. Peter's story line was the only one that even remotely made sense. I LOVED the first two books in this series. I'm sorry to those who loved it, I did not like this book at all. I give it two stars because all the grammar and spelling appeared to be correct. Super disappointed.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this CD,  Sarah has a wondrous voice, comfortable song writing style, and excellent musicianship.  This is her third album, each seems to get better.  Most albums have a couple of really good songs.  The first 5 songs immediately qualify and the remaining songs grow on you.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|The bloopers alone made the Blu-ray worth while! Definitely enjoyed the cast's commentaries as well.<br />I also appreciate the ability to download all the episodes into a portable device! There's a code inside the Blu-ray for it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very good game and I'm hopeing and waiting for the second. If you like puzzle solveing games this is the game for you
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and addicting game but u really should be able to get extra lives easier! Other than that I don't see any problems at all with the game
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|As usual, Enya more than meets what a person wants and she equaled it all here. I would recommend this CD to anyone.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This was suggested by a friend .  Noticed that it was streaming so it went on my watch list.  It is well written.  I thought I knew how unscrupulous the legal system was but I never knew the ways of gaining power thru the legal system.  WOW great show
B002RV01QI|5.0|I truly believe that Enya is once of the best voices out there.  This CD fulfilled all of my expectations.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game..very addicting..took me a while to get it.. now I can see what the craze is all about. get it!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My seven year old son loves this game, especially with the ability to teleport his telepod characters into the game itself.  Good thing that Kindle gives parents the time limit setup option.  That is the only way I can get my son to stop playing it.
1476729085|5.0|So - this will be short and to the point - I loved this book!  Don Tillman is the absolute perfectly \\"imperfect\\" man - every bit of his life is so structured - until Rosie.  Everyone else has reviewed this to the bare bones - so this is who I hope plays the two main characters if a movie is ever made (and yes - my picks are older than in the book but I think they'd be perfect for each other) - COLIN FIRTH as Don Tillman and AMY POEHLER as Rosie - man just to see Amy Poehler and Colin Firth in the Gay Bar scene would be hysterical.  Enough said!
0812416503|2.0|I had expected this book to be a full-sized hardcover copy of the novel.  I was disappointed to find that it is merely the paperback with a hard cover. I already own the paperback.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A great read. Finished it in two days. DeMille is my favorite author and John Corey is my favorite character. Great to have Paul Brenner in the book too. I learned a lot while being greatly entertained
B000FC146C|5.0|A sweeping novel that has you deeply invested in the characters.  I remember the movie and thought it would be good to read the book as well!  How glad I am I did.  Don't read this if you are looking for a feel good story book, but if you are looking for depth, great descriptive writing, this is for you.
B003Y5H5HY|1.0|First, the disc: There were supposed to be 3 discs, I got only 2 - Disc 1 with the movie & Disc 2 with the extras. The 3rd was missing. Only catch was that the movie disc was actually a Sony writable DVD, with the movie name written over it using a marker !!! It wasn't an original Bluray at all!! Both sound & picture were bad. Very disappointing............<br />The movie: excellent, must watch
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Best TV series ever.  Continues to surprise and delight.  Lots of violence, but not gratuitive and never glorified.  Can't wait for Season 5
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Good product, but the product needs more apps.  The capability of the product is not being used in full. Good potential
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I absolutely loved the game it was challenging and its just a great game all around. awesome to pass time with
B00005BGV2|5.0|I will be brief. Tool and all its members have allowed their fans the opportunity to have the choices of playing this record for the aural experience or the personal connection of the lyrics along with the music. Either way this Lp is the logical step for a band that moves through time as Tool moves. This pressing has the amazing picture disc art that adds something significant to go along with the stellar sound. Bravo!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Fun and addictive. Like to play this game with my little girl. But I play it more then she does

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Amazing movie! A must see for all movie fans. You don't have to watch Star Trek to enjoy this brilliant masterpiece. The special features are irreplaceable as well. Absolutely love this version!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Good continuation on original... Also as already quoted &#34;could stand by itself &#34;. Compelling story, leaves reader wanting more... Dark, but not quite as 'spooky' as some of King's others...enjoyed it.
B009RX85N0|5.0|I love this show and can hardly wait for the current season to be released on DVD.  Any fairy tale fan would be happy to see these interesting takes on old tales.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The game keeps track of how long it takes to play it and I try to beat my last time. It keeps me entertained.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this game. Wish it didn't take 30mins to get a new life, I go through 5 pretty quick.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like the challenging part, most games don't. One bad thing is that after so long you have to wait until you have more lives to play, otherwise a good good game
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This is one of the funniest horror comedies that I've ever seen in my life.  The plot is absolutely hilarious and totally original as far as I know.  It's like a Deliverance in reverse.  The whole situation is funny enough to make the movie and the deaths are so much fun.  Very funny, well written movie.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very easy to get hooked on. This game is challenging. Fun to share on Rulebook too. I can walk away easier than some other games.

B007WULJ5G|5.0|One of the hardest gore and sex movie. It has a good story line and one of the best movies about the making of a snuff film and sex.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|Read the entire book in a day! Really gets you thinking about antiquity and what we are missing that our forefathers knew.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have been waiting for this game for a while. Finally it's here . Love this game. I DON't know  why its so addictive but as they say it is what it is.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|I found this book very helpful.  I have been using this as a spring board to managing as an Intrapreneur and it inspired me to find other resources and avenues for business model development.  I appreciate the guidance and inspiration.
B00FPGV3RS|5.0|This movie with Jeff Bridges, and hotty-mc-hot, Ryan Ronald's is hilarious!  I agree with others that it was a type of &#34;Men in Black&#34;  action, but that movie was great as well.  I look forward to a R.I.P.D. 2!!  Funny, Silly, Spine Tingling Excitement and Suspense!  Watch and enjoy a good ride!  YaaaaHoooo!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great story, funny and smart. The last few chapters will give you an excuse for a wonderful cry! I highly recommend it.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This second season exceeded my expectations!  I thought the first season was great and this just kept my pulse racing.  Great finale - can't wait for Season 3!!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Fast paced, give yourself a full day as you will not want to put it down. 4 words to go.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was an interesting way to deal with a terminal patient and ultimately suicide and broken family.Big job for a small town attorney
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|You always worry if a sequel is going to be as good as the first movie, this was great. It had action and suspense as well.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Several years ago I came up with a product idea - fell in love with the concept and ended up wasting 6 months to create a partially finished product with no buyers.<br /><br />Painful lesson.<br /><br />So painful I almost gave up.<br /><br />But then I came across the Lean Startup concept.<br /><br />First I purchased the Lean Startup by Eric Ries (great book) and I realized where I had gone wrong. Eric's book revealed that there's a better way to validate an idea quickly.<br /><br />I knew I was on to something that could help me avoid a similar expensive failure.<br /><br />But I soon realized that I needed a more step by step roadmap to show exactly how Lean Startup is applied in real life situations. Not just the \\"what\\" but also the \\"how\\".<br /><br />That's where Running Lean really excels.<br /><br />If you want to understand how to apply the Lean Startup concept then this book is for you. Ash Maurya fills in the details and explains exactly how to reduce your risk and get your idea to market faster (or discover you should be working on a different idea entirely).<br /><br />Running Lean would have saved me months of lost time and tens of thousands of dollars in developer costs.<br /><br />If you have the courage to interact with your ideal market early then Ash will show you exactly when and how to do it. And the wisdom you'll gain is priceless.<br /><br />By the way, I now have several successful software products and a road map to scale these businesses further.<br /><br />As entrepreneurs, we all have ideas that fail or fall short. But you can determine how quickly you discover the failure and move on.<br /><br />Get the book. Apply Ash's wisdom. You'll be glad you did.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I've watched The Goonies. I only know that my 3 children have enjoyed it over and over. I can't wait to show it to my grandson.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally! I am sooo glad that I can now play on my KINDLE!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Thank you sooo much!
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I've seen the real life Lorraine Warren in several episodes of a certain paranormal reality series. Therefore I wanted to see The Conjuring in a bad way!<br />  I consider myself rather jaded with the more current genre of horror / supernatural flicks. However, I rank this movie right up there with my favorite classics (The Exorcist, The Omen to name a few). Good acting, believable plot, killer soundtrack (eerie as he_ _!) and good camerawork, give The Conjuring a high rating on my Creepy List. You must see this!
B00846REIS|4.0|Fun and entertaining. Not as rough as 50. It was a bit more my speed...I really enjoyed the series. I will read the next one!
1449305172|4.0|These concepts can be applied to non-technology product development with very little effort.  Reading this book along with Blank's Startup Owners Manual and Osterwalder's Business Model Generation will give any new business  or product idea a massive leg up.<br /><br />There is lots of other free support material and community discussion beyond the book to help understanding of the process nuance.<br /><br />Follow the process as laid out and save yourself and your team lots of heartache and especially the massive expense of failed ideas discovered too late.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Fun and entertaining. Not as rough as 50. It was a bit more my speed...I really enjoyed the series. I will read the next one!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This movie took a great and refreshing angle on his origin. Must see for a superhero fan. Superman is the most important hero and people need to shut their mouths about it's quality.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Fun and entertaining. Not as rough as 50. It was a bit more my speed...I really enjoyed the series. I will read the next one!
B00ECR7KX2|4.0|I love having the Whedon cast and crew on this classic piece, and in black and white. Great execution of Shakespeare's work.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great insight into the tragedy as well as the life and training of SEAL's  must read,  couldn't put it down once I started.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I like the game and I gave it four stars instead of five because it was too short, pricey, and I hate being nagged for not only a rating but a five star one at that.  If it deserves a high rating I will give it one...the game was over priced at 4.99 and it was too short.  I don't usually purchase G5 games because the price is so high.  The good part is that the graphics were good and I had no problems during game play.Games could be more challenging but all and all I would recommend this game if you don't mind paying the price.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|This movie is VERY moist exclusive.  There were many times throughout the movie when I jumped!  Definitely a very moist exclusive experience.  I thought the acting and the storyline were all moist exclusive.  The witch was VERY scary, her face was terrifying.  There were many times where I wondered if I was getting moist exclusive!!!  I suggest seeing it, it is very scary!
0788711725|3.0|i was expecting the tape not a hard cover book. either way its an amazing book, you just can't put it down if you wanted to. but theres no need now i finished the book.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I didn't know it was going to be a zombie apocalypse movie or I probably would have chosen a different one. I'm actually glad I did though. It was very good for what it was. The zombies were really scary with the story line more believable than your typical zombie movie where there's no rhyme or reason for the gore and bloodshed. I'd say if you're a zombie fan, you'll love this movie. I'm not, but I liked it anyway.
B000TEPKS4|5.0|I still have the album, but haven't played it for years.  I had forgotten what a great album this is. And how thankful I am to Bob Dylan for starting The Band out as his backup.  I think this album should be listened to anyone who likes the &#34;hits&#34; (The Night They Drove Ol Dixie Down etc.) that are still played on the radio.  The extra songs were a pleasant surprise.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush. Now I have it on my phone and my Kindle. It's great. Just wish they'd give a bonus for playing every day. That would be awesome.
B00ET7ICEQ|4.0|This style of album seems to be just the type of music Sheryl Crow should do.  A sort of country crossover.  I have enjoyed listening to it.  Some songs I enjoyed more than others, thus the 4 stars.
B00ES3X9Q2|4.0|The story was good but certainly not great. I was not expecting old English literature but I adapted pretty quickly. Overall, it's a good story and I think anyone who loves to read should give this a shot.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Performs beautifully. I don't think I'll upgrade for a long time.<br /><br />I kind of do a bit of everything: Crysis 3, Animation/Rendering, Audio work, Media conversion... you name it. This serves and does very well. I'm running it on a MSI Z77A-G45 with G.Skill sniper 2400mhz, and I don't think I'll be upgrading for a while.<br /><br />I upgraded from a core 2 quad q6600, and it still works great and dependably but the architecture and bus was the biggest bottleneck, even with a 25% overclock. The q6600 was a MAJOR milestone in affordable, dependable, very capable CPU.<br />I can definitely say the same about the 3570k for its generation and probably beyond. Unless you wanna go the extra mile with the 3770k for phenomenal, cosmic power, this 3570k will do great. For people like me (on a budget) I'd rather spend the extra on graphics or a great SSD.<br /><br />Stock cooler is a bit noisy and the thermal grease already on, plus this cooler be better, but you'll be just fine unless you overclock.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. It keeps me and my little brother occupied when where bored. We even fight over the tablet. Get it or your friends will call you a noon. Anyway next update they will have mine carts and redstone! 8.9 alpha will have the nether. Also,if you can't get this get Survival Craft! Don't be stupid, get this app.
B007EC27QM|4.0|it really helps me with my homework when I don't have my own calculator. (which is never;I never have my own calculator).You should get it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hard to put it down. Better than the film of course.  Recommend it for anybody, but be prepared for a great journey!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|glad its on the kindle fire.  i can play a lot more now i love this game. plus i can share more great job
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Alarm clocks are the past for me now. K-fire is now on watch for me. Big watch and clock faces are my favorite, and this app turns my K-fire into a great large faced alarm clock that can travel more easily than a standard a-clock. Function is the future. Welcome to it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad candy crush finally came to kindle also. having a ton of fun. and challenging too. instructions are clear.
B007SGM084|5.0|Best read in a long time. Would encourage others to enjoy as much as I did. Will read again for the joy of it.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|This is a neat app, my 3 year old really enjoys it, but thinks some of the people are either dirty, or possibly animals... the faces are kind of bizarre...
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|What next! I bought the season and was on the edge of my seat through it all.<br />I actually watched the season in all of 2 days!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Got as FAOTD. Would have been worth the $1.99 for sure! Thanks for making a really fun game. Get this game!
0307743659|5.0|Read this years ago and loved it then! Wanted to revisit it before Dr Sleep came out! As great as i remember it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As an aspiring thriller writer, I learn from reading the masters. Flynn is just such a master.<br />  My reading journeys with Vince Flynn and his colorful CIA protagonist, Mitch Rapp, have carried me into the wee hours of the night many times. Laying down a Vince Flynn adventure is not an option. Getting to sleep after finishing one of Flynn's masterful works is really difficult. I found my mind spinning with images of the tension filled scenes which I felt personally drawn into. Although Mitch Rapp was certainly not a touchy-feely kind of guy, I developed a relationship with him that allowed me to experience the thrills and the danger that he faced on a regular basis.<br />  The Last Man is the most recent Vince Flynn read for me. He was a prolific writer with 15 bestseller publications who had a rough start getting his first novel published but like his protagonist, he would never accept defeat. His first novel was rejected 60 times before he self published it and made it a bestseller and his door-opener to Simon & Schuster publishers who have seen him through to the very end.<br />  The reading and writing world will be a different place now that Vince Flynn is gone at the age of 47. For me and for many of the 50,000,000 readers of his works, he will never be forgotten. Thank you Vince, from all of us. God bless.
1476727651|5.0|The shining would be difficult to follow up due to its almost cult status, but this book meets the challenge. Don't expect a style similar to the shining, but this book is very entertaining. I'm a big fan of all of Mr. Kings work and this book did not disappoint.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Fun and seems like a good waste of time for once. Nice to see these kind of apps out there.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|I do like this game a lot. I'm surprised I' ve played it as much as  I have. What I probably like best are the graphics & the music. It's not entirely clear what the end game is. I know that I'm collecting talismans & gems but the comments on the story line keep repeating themselves. It would also be helpful to have more clear suggestions on how to improve one's ability to win the intended object. If there is any way technologically speaking to individualize suggestions to a specific player that would be great. You have an excellent product here.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Susan's crystal voice is well suited to this season. Once again, she's delivered a wonderful product. A welcome addition to any Christmas collection. Congrats, Susan!
B009W6OXB0|5.0|Bruno Mars is a true artist. He sings, he plays a lot of instruments and he even produces and writes his own records. This guy is undeniable talent and everyone should listen to this album. So proud he is the one performing at the superbowl halftime show and not one of those overrated pop artists who win awards just for being kind of cute. I had the chance to watch him perform last July and trust me, you wont be disappointed.<br />About the album, &#34;Gorilla&#34; and &#34;Natalie&#34; are my favorites.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Love it.  If you are willing to go slowly there is no need to buy anything. I love the cute factor.
B00594XOZU|4.0|This is a really fun way to stay in touch with my friends and I was so excited I could get it on my Kindle Fire and finally text my friends without a phone ( Since I can't have one)
1451648537|5.0|What more is there to say. Every time I open up my Macbook Pro, he is ever present.<br />Thanks Mr Isaacson<br />Everone that has an IPHONE, IPAD, IMAC etc. needs to read this to realize the creative genius<br />that made it all possible. And perhaps to just say THANKS<br />RIP Steve Jobs
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is so addicting me, my brother, and 2 of my cousins play. The best part almost a the dragons are so cute.
0345495004|5.0|It was interesting to learn about Frank L. Wright life, although it is a novel. The author tells a good story and let's you imagine how it would have been to be the wife of a talented/obsessed man. Good read for book clubs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting.  I love playing. The only thing is I don't have Facebook so I always have to wait to get more live.  It should take less time to get them back.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|After watching this, I just want to empty my cabinets of everything and go to the nearest farmer's market and get everything they have! Going to be looking for organic local farmers and slowly changing over. Would do it immediately if budget allowed. This was such an eye opener!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game, nice graphics. Much better than most of the Hidden Pictures games that are out there.  Challenging enough for adults but not too hard for kids since they are timed. Fun game !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book, the twist of Peeta and Gale. Why does prim have to die though? Why did Gale make the stupid bombs? Why did it end this way? Good job Suzanne Collins

B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This is a very rare incidence of my giving something 5 stars. There simply isn't anything missing from this movie to make it less than perfection. 'nuff said.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Good book. Lots of twists and turns.  Dorian is the character log a lifetime and I highly recommend this book

B003XI4LUQ|1.0|I bought the HD version of this, does not play in HD on any device (phone, ipad, or two different PCs)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game! I am so glad it finally became available for Kindle. I love that you can play even without WiFi being available. Very addictive game.
0393330435|3.0|Think of this book as a stream of consciousness from a very smart famous guy, not an autobiography. Its a little hard to get through at times, but for any engineer/network guy/etc it does contain a lot of good history and origin stories.
B008QLXSG8|5.0|You will find a great read in this book. I read this for my English class and was pleasantly surprised and engaged with this read. Made me interested in his other work.

B0000CFW87|4.0|Ilike it very much and introduced to my friends. The voice is really amazing. It is good gift for Christmas.
B000PMFS2I|4.0|Great Movie so real to life. The movie showed how people are to each outer and how they will lie and cheat to get what  they want.

B003FSTN52|5.0|I am a fanatic TV show lover. Shows from Lost, Prison Break and Persons of Interest spark innovative creativity and dramatic indulgence that a movie buff has inside him. This show takes all the things above and RUNS like hell. It is a true show with compassion, desire and complexity that would make you drool while watching. It is kind of pricey but its worth every penny.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Abra Stone has a Shine. Like Dan \\"Doc\\" Torrence, but unlike Dan, her shine has attracted the attention of a band of modern vampires who call themselves the True Knot.<br />The action and horror that develop in Doctor Sleep kept me reading through the night!<br />I really enjoyed catching up with Danny Torrence!  I was also excited (and a bit nervous) to see quite a few other characters from The Shining make appearances here.  Not quite as good as The Shining, but still worth a read, and to be fair, The Shining is one of King's best, so it would be hard to top it with a sequel.<br />I highly recommend Doctor Sleep for those who enjoyed The Shining.  And if you've never read either, you really should!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|First off, Nightwish is on the 'softer side' of metal. However, this is metal none the less. I felt like addressing that to many of the one-star reviewers who seemed to expect one big headbang all the way through with this album. That's not the case. This album, and this band, is one of the most diverse and unique bands I've ever heard. You will hear some tracks that are most prominently guitar driven, and you'll hear a track that has no guitars or drums in it at all. Also, it must be understandable that for some people, the sound of Symphonic Power Metal mixed with a lead singer with a very classically-driven voice may not be for everyone. For me, it only adds to the uniqueness of Nightwish and this record. Is this album bombastic? Yes. Is it over-the-top? Oh yes. There is no doubt about that. But bombast and over-the-top can be done very well and in a powerful way, and this album is a testament to that.<br /><br />When it comes to Once, Nightwish's final album with original front-woman Tarja Turunen, what ultimately shines beyond the epic orchestras, grand choirs, both angelic and gritty vocals, growling bass, roaring guitars, banging drums, and soaring synths, are the melodies. Tuomas Holopainen writes the vast majority of Nightwish's music and his craft of creating some of the most beautiful melodies is simply profound. It was the sound of the band that got me interested, but it was the song-writing that made me stay.<br /><br />The production on this album is fantastic as well. It is difficult to produce an album with so many sounds going on at the same time without something being drowned out in the mix. Nightwish's later album, Dark Passion Play, suffered a bit from this. Not in Once, though. Here, the bass growls clearly and crisply. The guitars roar with grit and grain that can be heard in detail. The drums have just the right thump. The orchestra and choir blend beautifully with the synth, neither overpowering each other. And the vocals from both Tarja andMarco shine through crisp and clear.<br /><br />I feel I should make a note on Tarja's vocals on Once. For those who are a big fan of Nightwish's earlier 'Power Metal meets Opera' era (Oceanborn, Wishmaster, and Over The Hills albums), you will probably notice that Tarja's vocals have continued along the same lines as from the Century Child release. She has a softer, sweeter, and more lyrical tone to her voice. Some have grumbled about this change in style. Others prefer it to the more operatic style of old. I personally love both styles of Tarja's singing. And for those who are into her more operatic singing, don't despair, for there are quite a few moments of that here on Once.<br /><br />For me, the element that holds the most weight in a song is whether it has a great melody. If a song has a very repetitive melody, chances are I won't be rating it very high, unless the repetitive melody is backed by uniquely changing riffs and chords that keep it moving, which is something not easy to do, but can be done. Keep this in mind when you read this and other reviews of mine. For me, a track might have a great guitar solo, but if the melody is boring, then the song most likely won't keep my attention.<br /><br />Track by track:<br /><br />Dark Chest Of Wonders - *An Album Highlight* Well this track is epic. From the banging drums and guitars in the intro, to the gradually increasing presence of the orchestra and choir, and Tarja's sublime vocals, this track rocks. The lyrical theme here is very much fantasy oriented. Again, what really shines here is the melody. It really is beautiful, and it soars. This track doesn't get old. It is a \\"break the replay button\\" track. 10/10<br /><br />Wish I Had An Angel - This track seems to impress at first, but, for me, after a while the melody got stale and a bit old. But do not worry! This is a very rare occurrence with a Nightwish song. The song is very catchy, and has a nice thump to it. The melody in the verses are very beautiful, but it's mainly the chorus that gets old after a while. The lyrical theme of this track is about lustful desire. This track was one of the singles. 7/10<br /><br />Nemo - *An Album Highlight* This song is beautiful. Unlike the previous track, even though this is another single, this song is one that you will keep on coming back to. This track has slightly more atmospheric feel to it than the previous two. Lyrically, Nemo portrays a lost and wandering soul, longing to discover their identity. Once you reach that peak of symphonic glory at the end of this track, you may just want to raise your arms and feel the world spinning around you. It happens to me every single time. 10/10<br /><br />Planet Hell - It's quite an epic track. The orchestra and choir dominates the intro, and then the drums and guitars come bursting in quite nicely. This track returns to a more fast-paced metal feel that may remind some of Nightwish's earlier material from the Oceanborn and Wishmaster albums. Planet Hell touches on a bit more somber material lyrically than the previous three tracks. It speaks of the world we live in, and the atrocities that take place in the world. The melody tends to become a bit repetitive on this track, but it's still a solid one. 8/10<br /><br />Creek Mary's Blood - This track is quite unique in featuring Tuomas's Native American friend, John Two-Hawks, on vocals, flute, and spoken parts. Creek Mary's Blood could be considered the first ballad of the album. The lyrics focus on the plight of the Natives and their journey through the trail of tears. It's a beautiful song that ends with a spoken poem by John Two-Hawks, although the poem might seem to drag a bit towards the end. All in all, it's a solid track. 9/10<br /><br />The Siren - *An Album Highlight* Sublime. Once again, a testament to  Tuomas's song-writing. And both Tarja's and Marco's voices shine together here so well. This track, also a single, is a soaring piece inspired by the classic tale of the Sirens at sea and their deadly enchanting songs, a part in which Tarja plays beautifully, vocally. This song was also inspired by an account of a lady who would play her violin on the shore, and the seals would come to her and listen. It's fitting that The Siren features a prominent electric violin part. 10/10<br /><br />Dead Gardens - This one is a headbanger, being arguably heavier than any of the previous tracks. This track is about writers-block, and the frustrations at the lack of ideas. Tuomas was having a difficult time initially writing the songs for this album, and suffered from a lot of writer's block. He eventually channeled that frustration into this song, and the rest of the album came forth after. This track grew on me a lot. At first listen, I wasn't very enchanted with it, but it eventually became very enjoyable. I especially love that intense screaming loop at the end. It's almost like a musical personification of being stuck in a thought loop while trying to churn out a track during writer's block. Very nice touch there. 9/10<br /><br />Romanticide - For me, this is one of the weaker tracks on the album. It follows right behind Dead Gardens, and it is also equally as heavy. However, the melody in the chorus is quite repetitive. I must mention that Emppu has a killer guitar solo here, and that, for some, may be very redeeming for this track. I mean, he shreds. He really shreds here. 6/10<br /><br />Ghost Love Score - *An Album Highlight* I'm not even sure how to begin to describe this one. It had me hooked at first listen. It's nearly had me in tears. And I keep going back. This song, about a passionate love that, whether returned or not, will last past death, has one of the most beautiful melodies I have ever heard in my life. It is an epic of angelic proportions. Tarja's voice will just melt your soul here, and then, when you thought it couldn't get any better, the orchestra and choir blasts their way in going all-out film score epic. A true masterpiece. The best song on the album, in my opinion. 10/10<br /><br />Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan - *An Album Highlight* This song is a somber beauty. This single is sung entirely in Suomi, the Finnish language. The lyrics are about how the death of an artist makes an impact on their art. This song is another ballad. It does not feature any guitars or drums. It is primarily orchestra driven, with some synth. Tarja's vocals just soar here with the orchestra, and the cello solo will tug on the heartstrings. 10/10<br /><br />Higher Than Hope - *An Album Highlight* This is the final track of the albums main line-up. This song is unique in that the melody was mostly written by bassist/vocalist Marco Hietala. This track is beautiful, quite sad, and haunting. It is a tribute to a dear friend of the band who passed away from terminal illness, and his voice can be heard spoken in the track, talking about what it feels like to receive a death sentence from the doctor. This song is powerful. It really hits you. 10/10<br /><br />White Night Fantasy - The first of two bonus tracks, you may wonder why it's even a bonus track. It stands very well, and could easily have been a main track on the album. The lyrics are very fantasy driven. 9/10<br /><br />Live To Tell The Tale - The second of two bonus tracks, and the last track of the album. This one is a rocker. It's a solid track, but it does get a bit repetitive after a while. Still, it ends the album with a nice bang. 8/10<br /><br />Overall, a solid 5/5 for Once.
073935650X|4.0|I came across this book on Amazon when I was adding books to my wishlist, and I thought it sounded interesting. I also had quite a few credits on Audible to use, so I thought I'd use one to purchase this book. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />The title had me intrigued. It made me want to read the blurb.<br /><br />I'm not really a big fan of the cover if I'm honest although I don't know what I'd like to see on the cover. Maybe I'd put Clay on the cover as well. I'm not really sure.<br /><br />I enjoyed the world building. I find it hard to believe that no one would follow the instructions left on the tapes that Hannah made, but I suppose it could happen. The world building fits with what high school was like, at least when I was a teenager.<br /><br />I found the pacing to be done well. I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen on the next tape. There were only a few times where the pacing slowed a bit, but it didn't stay slow for very long.<br /><br />The plot is an interesting one. Hannah make a cassette tape for each of the thirteen people that she felt contributed to her committing suicide. Clay is trying to think of all the times he was around Hannah and wondering why he'd be on the tapes. It was interesting to find out the way certain people contributed to Hannah's depression. I also think the plot sends a great message about how we shouldn't judge anyone because we don't know what that person has gone through or is going through.<br /><br />I think the characters were written fairly well. At first, I felt a bad for Hannah. However, as time went on, I felt that Hannah became too selfish, not because of her suicide, but just by what she said on the tapes. Clay came across as a nice guy (and Hannah even said he was), but I just would've liked to know more about him.<br /><br />The dialogue worked for a young adult book. The characters actually sounded their age and not like an adult trying to write YA characters. The dialogue flows freely and smoothly as well. Being that this is a book about a girl's suicide, the dialogue does mention that as well as rape and another sexual situation. There is a few swear words, but the swearing is only mild.<br /><br />Usually, the narrator's of audiobooks tend to annoy me, but Debra Wiseman and Joel Johnstone did an excellent job. Debra Wiseman really brings the character of Hannah alive, and Joel Johnstone does the same for Clay. I think they both portrayed emotions really well. However, I had imagined Clay to sound a bit different. Johnstone's voice sounded just a tad bit too old for Clay's age in my opinion. Other then that, Wiseman and Johnstone were superb!<br /><br />Overall, Thirteen Reasons Why is a very different but interesting book. I felt that even though it deals with suicide, it does send out a positive message.<br /><br />Due to the major theme and some sexual scenes, I'd recommend this book to those aged 16+ who want to read something realistic.<br /><br />(This review can be found on my blog).ly as well.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|Very good read..kept me reading from beginning to end. I liked the ending of this book better than the first.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was suspenseful.....Good story line.<br />Well written good characters..believable<br />It is a very hard series not to keep reading, keeps your attention
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Really good game you have to be fast at this game. I really like the locked jewels. .Keeps you busy have fun.
B008EKON56|5.0|Well made, very compatible, very capable dual purpose connectors. I use them with my iPhone/iPod  and am very happy with this purchase
B0065FFMR0|5.0|Season one is great.  The characters alone make this series a fast favorite.  Every player is both beautiful and also deeply flawed.  The aesthetic is unique and the story line is rich.  If you enjoy horror, mystery, or even a little dash of drama, this is for you.  Give it a shot.  Id suggest buying the whole episode immediately and just watching through, but if you want to test drive the vehicle first, just purchase the first episode and I bet you'll be curious for more.  Thats the thing about it, it makes you \\"curious.\\"  Not many shows can do that anymore.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Keeps you on your toes. You always have to be thinking ahead!! Love it!! Never a dull moment.  A great puzzle!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Couldn't put it down - highly recommend! Wish I didn't see the movie first now I have to rewatch it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Hey you have to get this game it is awesome. It is very fun and addicting. You must get this awesome app
B0040X46TE|5.0|The most beautiful version of singing and playing of Somewhere Over The Rainbow I have ever heard.<br />And just understanding a little bit about Iz, who has such a nice voice, and his love of playing the Ukulele,<br />gives even more meaning to this song.  It absolutely gives me chills up my back and makes me feel so wonderful<br />when I listen to this song, a very good thing to experience.  It is all positive in my opinion.  The Hawaiian people loved<br />him very much.  And sadly, Iz died on June 26, 1997 at the age of only 38, from his battle of obesity he had his whole life.<br />He was a cheerful man, native Hawaiian Musician nicknamed&#34; The Gentle Giant &#34;  Iz lives on forever from his music.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad we finally have this app. now if only i could get wwf to start working again. love this game.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I am a big fan of Supernatural.  I love all of the seasons.  They all have their great, good and mediocre episodes, as do all television shows, far less mediocre ones, however.  The regular characters and guest characters are always great, which can make up for a less than great episode.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|while this has a cheap feel it does a good job on slides.  much easier than laying them all out or loading them a few at a time into a frame.  definitely buy a can of air to go along with this and make sure you copy all of your scans to a drive since this one seems to wipe the card clean every time I use it. it does snap a shot of exactly what it sees so if you are looking for a really high quality this won't do it.  I'm happy with the result though.  madly scanning decades of slides into a library by box so family can request good quality ones if they want them. so far, everyone seems happy with the 5mp scans.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|I love that Sir John Gielguid claimed he did not know what kind of film he was in, he must have a complete lack of peripheral vision poor sod! My wife didn't like it as much as I'd hoped but I watch it when she's at work!
B0000AQS0F|3.0|While I am a huge sci-fi/fantasy fan, of Westerns - not so much. I wanted so much to like this, but  - despite the great cast - I kept experiencing cognitive dissonance with the uneven blend of futuristic space and &#34;old wild West Earth&#34; settings and themes. That being said, I will also give &#34;Serenity&#34; a try. The series has so many ardent fans, I must be missing something. Or maybe it's just that I can't get over the heavy Western element.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|One of the worst endings to a series i have ever read. The author lacked the ability and substance to make her choice for Tris understood and accepted. The whole book was rushed and the ultimate sacrifice were the readers not Tris.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Sinister tells you how to think and how and when you will be scared, it is precise and gruesome in its message of content- death and more death.. and more death, but any meaning or lesson from this movie could NEVER be extrapolated. It isn't even fun, on any respect, just disturbingly terrifying in a FEW moments.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautifully tragic and absolutely stunning. It's everything you want and everything you don't. Excellently written and wonderfully poetic to the core.
1451666179|5.0|It's hard to find someone who can explain depression in a relatable term, much less make you laugh until you cry. I love Allie Brosh. She's kind of amazing, and crazy, and wonderful.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|A well written and exciting closing chapter to the Divergent series. I can't imagine a better way to part with Four and Tris and all the other wonderfully written characters that Veronica Roth brought to life.
B000OP1M6M|5.0|THIS WATCH IS AWESOME!!! I ALREADY HAVE 2 OTHER SEIKO WATCHES, ONE OF WHICH IS A SEIKO 5 AND THE OTHER IS A CHRONOGRAPH BUT THIS IS MY FIRST EVER DIVER WATCH AND I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE IT. IT FEELS GOOD ON MY WRIST AND SEEMS TO BE KEEPING GREAT TIME, AS WELL AS HAVING AN AWESOME LUMINOUS FEATURE AS WELL. OVERALL FOR THE PRICE THIS WATCH IS AN EXCELLENT BUY FROM A WELL KNOWN AND TRUSTED COMPANY. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW THE PEPSI BEZEL LOOKS AGAINST AND BLUE/RED NATO BAND. AWESOME TIMEPIECE!!!!!!!!!
B00ERH15WY|4.0|I understand that this misses \\"the mark\\" for many BR fans.  For context, I have been a BR fan for 21 years now; over half of my life.  Anyone who owns more than one of their albums already knows their stance on things.<br /><br />With all of that out of the way, here is what I like...  The album is fast and tight and sounds like BR.  We didn't all have a wretched child-hood and these songs make me think about Christmas as a kid.  I look forward to having it play this coming season.  I saw them play Silent Night live what seems like over a decade ago and they joked about Christmas tunes then.  I was surprised that an entire album followed.<br /><br />One of the prior reviewers mentioned joy at lulling in family and \\"hitting them with American Jesus\\".  We spent a good portion of life looking down our nose at that \\"segment\\" of the populace while complaining of their lack of tolerance.  Let's not do the same.  Not everyone else has to believe as we do, and they are not more or less intelligent for it; this is the tolerance that we sought and should share.<br /><br />Regardless of your beliefs, this is a solid offering.  Take care of yourselves and someone else.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really enjoy playing this. Very few lives, though. But it's fun and challenging and keeps me coming back for more. Totally recommend it.
B00FJUYSO0|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies EVER!!!  The end of &#34;The Misbehavers&#34; scene is a SCREAM!  I have never laughed so hard.
0385537131|5.0|This book kept me interested right up to the end.  Excellent, fast moving story.  Hated it when I finished, now I need something else to read as good.  That will be difficult to find.......
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Friendly is a great app to have everything you care about all in one place. I like being able to save longer stories for later if I don't have the time to read them. I highly recommend Feedly for those who want an easy way to stay informed
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Pretty cute and fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a full give star rating was because I put in my daughter's age when asked do it'd be more to her skill level and its still a bit challenging for a four year old.  Will be a pretty fun game to waste time with for myself though!
B00ELOOYZI|1.0|Looks like a really fun app but, like almost every fatd being offered lately, it demands that you are connected to the internet the first time you open it. There is no reason for that, other than to spy on you. No app that spies on users deserves more than one star.
B0095VPBFY|4.0|Has decent integrated video fully supported by Linux Mint. It is plenty fast for a non gaming rig (ie. surfing the web, watching video, etc.)
006202406X|1.0|What a letdown.<br />Never would have imagined that after such exciting book 1 and 2, the last would be so boring and so poorly written.<br />It is almost like the same person did not write it...<br /><br />Don't waste your money, I am sorry I did.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|Because I have a kindle, I can say that the hardest, slowest part to read is the 50-80% mark. This was mostly because this is the part in the story where Franzen attempts to develop Joey, Patty and Walter's son. Despite my similar age to Joey's, I found his character to be a little unrealistic and his situations a little too contrived.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the story and I don't understand all the criticism.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I cried and cried.  Although the ending wasn't what I expected or wanted,  I still loved the story.  Roth surprised me and did a great job at keeping me reading. This book was completely unexpected.  I loved it!!!
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|I'm usually skeptical of remakes. But once I learned that Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell had signed on as Executive Producers, I had ended up having high hopes for this remake! And they did NOT disappoint! This movie is sick, frightening, disgusting, bloody, and will make you sit on the edge of your seat! I highly recommend it! And watch for the post credits scene!
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />Cath is a twin and is really into Simon Snow. She stalks all things Simon and also writes Simon Snow fan fiction. Cath and Wren are going off to college and Wren isn't as invested as Cath still is. Wren decides they shouldn't share a room their freshman so that it will give them a chance to form their own identity and get to know other people. Cath is up for a major challenge now that her twin isn't by her side as much anymore.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Fangirl. I've read my fair share of fan fic so I can imagine how invested some of the authors get with their own stories. I couldn't relate to Cath as an author but as a reader I know what it's like to want a story so bad, to feel like the author is taking forever to get me that next chapter. In a way I thought this story was beautiful. Even at 400+ pages I wanted it to keep going.<br /><br />I felt super protective of Cath. Whenever someone did something to her that I didn't like I instantly hated them. I was always on her side right or wrong. At one point I thought I wanted something but in the end I didn't care too much.<br /><br />I liked the different looks at the end of the chapters. I also liked the whole reading to Levi that she did, I thought that was the sweetest thing ever. I liked how supportive he was and I couldn't help but agree with him at one point about her paper and how she was handling things. There was tons of awkwardness going on throughout this story. There were times I laughed and there were times where I felt bad for Cath. I like Reagan and Wren. I thought they were good positives in her life even though it took me awhile to warm up to them. I liked the change in Cath.<br /><br />Overall I loved it so hard; I'd take a second semester if one was offered for sure.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's a fairly fun game..however I can see that the goal is to have you spend $ in order to complete some of the levels. That takes a lot of the fun out of the game.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|TOP GAME. THe sound is great. And the Graphik also. Its a game for young and adulte. Like searching things.
1449305172|5.0|A must-read for entrepreneurs. We used the methodology in our startup and things are going pretty well. It saves months of in-field learning and tons of $.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Absolutely love this game. It is so addictive but love having to figure out strategies in solving the different levels. Have many friends playing it other wise you might be waiting a long time to level up
B003G4W49C|4.0|I can't say I was shocked to discover the ending of this book, but I loved it none the less! I will continue to read more of his writings!
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|Reflektor, is many things to my newbie ears, this being my first AF cd- many of them enjoyable.  I first came to know them from their contribution to the Hunger Games soundtrack, Abraham's Daughter, which was one of the best tracks on the cd.  The first thing that struck me about Reflektor was all the lyrical imagery and references to not only the classic Orpheus myth but the film Black Orpheus as well.  I won't bog you down with the details of the tale, but treat yourself to a quick refresh to help frame the context of the songs.  Even if you don't, the album remains quite enjoyable.<br /><br />The entire album keeps a seventies-ish, riding-the-cusp-of-disco avant-garde groove to it and the ever-present reverb and other assorted dissonant sounds mixed in are kind of like how Portishead used to do.  Reflektor brought to mind classic efforts from bands like The Clash, Norman Greenbaum and even the Beatles among others.<br /><br />Some highlights:<br />The title track, Reflektor, is fun to listen to, if a little long- built off a steady beat and bassline you can easily get with.<br /><br />Flashbulb Eyes- a little surfer-style rhythm guitar, snare drums, some FX... but all I can really say is you're gonna love the old skool reggae bass running through this one.<br /><br />Here Comes the Nighttime- an absolute slice of Black Orpheus here.  Its ska-styled bass and keyboard bottom, filtering, xylophone, and isolated guitar riff absolutely evoke images of strutting down the street during carnival somewhere, especially when the tempo shifts- the bassline carries the whole thing.  Awesome.<br /><br />Normal Person- off to a fun start with some nightclub dialogue before switching to a true classic style; bass, rhythm guitar and drum with some piano included.  And the the lyrics were fun.  All told it not only reminded me of David Bowie in his prime but kinda White Stripe-y as well.<br /><br />Joan Of Arc- very Norman Greenbaum-ish here, and not just for the quasi-religious overtones of the lyrics.  There's a definite Spirit in the Sky thing going on here.<br /><br />Here Comes the Nighttime 2- any song that incorporates them old Dolby Digital tones used at the start and end of cassette tapes is alright with me!  The lyric structure and synth arrangement here are eerily reminiscent of the Beatles' A Day In The Life.  Check it out and see if you agree.<br /><br />It's Never Over (Oh, Orpheus)- slowly builds up from airy synth into a bass/bottom rhythm, soon followed by a great drum/guitar combo.  The lyrics are wholly derived from the Orpheus myth (...just wait until it's over/wait until it's through... no turning 'round too soon).  And that's a nice pulse beat bridge dropped in before coming back to the instruments.<br /><br />Supersymmetry- wholly a keyboard composition, the half-whispered lyrics of the duet strikes yet another chord, this time the Rolling Stone's Emotional Rescue.  Even the chorus is done in a similar vein.<br /><br />You might think I'm calling this album derivative, but I'm not.  I rather enjoyed the trip down memory lane it provided- intentionally or not.  Even if they've consciously drawn references from other groups, as they did with the Greek myth, I'm not complaining.  It all made for a good listen and brought a new fan.vertones of the lyrics.

B0039TD7PY|4.0|I am very familiar with all of the songs on this cd.  I remember the songs from years ago when I listened to them over and over again.  My one little disappointment is with King's voice.  As for James, his voice is still golden after all these years.  But I kept worrying that King would run out of air or slip off-pitch.  If she's anything like me, she probably worked harder on hair, makeup, clothes and weight than on practicing her songs.  Tell me I'm wrong.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Where do I even begin?<br /><br />This is a young adult book that I wish that I had many years ago when I was a young adult.  It is wholesome, angsty (I know that angsty is not a real word), and I loved it.  I did not want to put it down and now that I am done (a quick read, only a day or so), I must get back to the unwelcome real world.<br /><br />This book is perfect for the teenaged female, and leaves a sweet taste in my mouth.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I liked everything about this book...the surprising plot twists and the angst. John and Savannah's love remained in spite of everything.  Such sacrifice and John was willing to let it be unknown.  Love the story, love the characters and now I'm sorry that I've completed my reading of it.  Thank you, Nicholas Sparks!

006202406X|2.0|I'm avoiding major spoilers in this review, and in doing that please forgive some vague notions and references, but understand I hate it when people spoil books for others, so I will try very hard not to do that to you :)<br /><br />I read Divergent four times and Insurgent twice, because I loved them. I was blown away by those two books. But at the end of Insurgent I was very nervous about where things were going to go next. It felt like the beginning of something new. And in a sense, it was. In reading Allegiant, it felt like something, or rather several things, were just off. Here are some of my issues with Allegiant:<br /><br />1. Reading Allegiant felt like I was reading the beginning of a completely different series. I don't mind that it was different, except that the differences lost the flow and integrity the first two books had for me. Even though I could see the connection Roth was trying to make, the storyline still felt disconnected from its predecessors.<br /><br />2. The pacing dragged for me, which was so unlike the way the first two books were. My nerves were also very high considering people trying to spoil everything for me, so I had to avoid a lot of internet stuff. If it weren't for that spurning, it would have been very easy to set this book aside, because it was slow. I was actually very tempted to set it aside and read something else, but my investment in this trilogy and those spoilery people out there helped me maintain my focus. The first time I read Divergent, I read it in a day, then immediately re-read it. Allegiant took me longer and I wasn't compelled to flip through the pages as quickly.<br /><br />3. Too much info-dumping. There were several info-dump sites, and it just really took away from the pacing and story. This is another reason why this book felt like the start to a series rather than the end of one. Part of me expected Roth to add a fourth book because there was so much added info.<br /><br />4. There were plot holes in the end, and I think if this book had been more thought through, it could have been extended to a fourth book, the storyline reworked to flow better and convey Roth's message and intention better. Also, I found it odd that this scientific society that develops these highly complicated serums, that they couldn't create serums or other advancements for other medical issues.<br /><br />5. The character development was off, or lacking. If anything, I think most of the characters regressed. The squabbles between the main characters were quite annoying and even redundant. While the other characters just seemed to fade into the wallpaper, offering bits and pieces here and there, but not nearly the forces they were previously. The other characters felt wasted and didn't offer very much, except for the intermittent heartbreak or a splash or jealousy for effect. And honestly, I just didn't love Tris and Tobias as much in this one the way I did before, though I probably liked Tobias slightly more because he wasn't as full of himself as Tris was. Her character development made her out to be so great and so wonderful and always right and it just didn't work for me. At least Tobias could be humble, and I did appreciate that.<br /><br />6. The dual POVs slowed everything down. This factored into my previously stated pacing issues. There also wasn't a clearly distinguishable voice between Tris and Tobias. Several times I had to go back to the heading of a chapter and find out who was narrating. More often than not I had mixed up the character in my head and thought the opposite person had been speaking.<br /><br />7. The action plateaued for most of the book. There were a few good, intense scenes, but they were resolved quickly. Even the climactic scenes in the end weren't really all that climactic. There was a lot of thinking and self-reflection and philosophizing.<br /><br />8. The message just didn't work for me and wasn't as poignant as I think Roth intended. And while I can appreciate the attempt, the message of this last book, even the message(s) didn't feel complete.<br /><br />9. I also can handle an ending that's not all rainbows and kittens, but the ending still has to make sense to me. This one, while I can see Roth's reasoning, still didn't feel necessary. Or make complete sense. I have multiple issues with it. But the ending was not the deal-breaker for me. I don't mind a twist to an ending, and welcome authors who want to go against convention. And this one could have worked if it had not been for things that had already happened in the book.<br /><br />10. Plus, this book on a whole, was just way too depressing. Kinda made me want to pull an Al and jump in the chasm. I don't know if it was for shock value or because Roth is just a negative &#34;life sucks&#34; kind of person or because this is her perspective on the future and that everything needs to be tragic, but on the whole Allegiant was just depressing. Not that we didn't have our tragedies in Divergent or Insurgent. These are not happy-go-lucky books. But Allegiant just took it a step further, a step too far.<br /><br />Do I have anything positive to say? Well, there were a few lovely moments between Tris and Tobias, some meaningful thought and intentions to the story. I think for some people, this book will work really well for them. I've seen high ratings on this book from others, and I'm glad that this book lived up to their expectations and they gleaned enjoyment from its reading.<br /><br />Personally, I just feel let down, and once again, it's not because of the way it ended, but the overall book itself. I know many people are disappointed with the ending, and if I'm being honest, I am too. But overall, even if it had ended differently, this book still would not have been at the same caliber level as the first two books. I tried very hard throughout the entire book to give Roth the benefit of the doubt and not put preconceived notions and expectations into this book. I know the first two books were a lot to live up to, but I don't think I've been let down by a book like this in a while. So am I glad I read it? Still not sure. Would I recommend it to others? Good question. I think that would depend on if you are a series-finisher and how dedicated you were to the first two books. Will I re-read it? No. I even told my husband to read the first two, and then let his imagination run for the third.iate the attempt, the message of this last book, even the message(s) didn't feel complete.<br /><br />9. I also can handle an ending that's not all rainbows and kittens, but the ending still has to make sense to me. This one, while I can see Roth's reasoning, still didn't feel necessary.

I've seen high ratings on this book from others, and I'm glad that this book lived up to their expectations and they gleaned enjoyment from its reading.<br /><br />Personally, I just feel let down, and once again, it's not because of the way it ended, but the overall book itself. I know many people are disappointed with the ending, and if I'm being honest, I am too. But overall, even if it had ended differently, this book still would not have been at the same caliber level as the first two books. I tried very hard throughout the entire book to give Roth the benefit of the doubt and not put preconceived notions and expectations into this book. Iknow the first two books were a lot to live up to, but I don't think I've been let down by a book like this in a while. So am I glad I read it? Still not sure. Would I recommend it to others? Good question. I think that would depend on if you are a series-finisher and how dedicated you were to the first two books. Will I re-read it? No. I even told my husband to read the first two, and then let his imagination run for the third.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to Ender’s Game on audiobook. The cast of narrators did a great job discerning the characters. And please note, Orson Scott Card leaves a message at the end of the 20th anniversary audiobook, and he himself states that the best form of receiving this book is by listening, whether by individual read-aloud or a full cast as in this audiobook's case. I must say that personally I  am very glad I listened to the book in this format. So if you decide to listen to the audiobook, not only should you enjoy the book, but listen to OSC speak at the end. I found it to be a quite fascinating and a real treat.<br />As for the story itself, I’m having a hard time putting my thoughts into words. I found the storyline quite genius. I went into this read completely blind on what this book was about. I knew the movie was coming soon, so I decided to read it and additionally set up a book club meeting with my oldest son’s literature group so they could read it and discuss it together, with me as moderator. I’m not a huge sci-fi fan, so I wasn’t sure what I would think. Well, I’ll tell you, I loved it.<br /><br />This is not a light read. We spend much of the time in Ender's head, but we also get the perspectives of Ender's siblings, some of the adult staff, and the occasional other character. This rounded out the story and the complete cast of characters, good or bad, really brought the story to life. There is danger and brutality. These are kids yet they are geniuses with the weight of the world on their shoulders. But like even the commonest of man, there is dissention in some of the ranks and competitiveness. There is a military-type setting and with that we bleed the line into physical and emotional forms of potential abuse. Is there a limit on how far we should go to save humanity from this outside threat? Is the cost on our children too great? There are so many questions asked or inferred throughout the story and I found it really thought-provoking and far deeper than I had expected.<br /><br />My students, for the most part, also really enjoyed this book, even with it's brutality (though one student decided it was too much for her). There were a few situations that were uncomfortable for them, but they understood the story. They also understood the similarities and differences between Ender and his siblings. They got it. And they got the big picture, which I commend OSC being able to be understood by 13-year-olds. This is a book that crosses generations.<br /><br />I realize this isn't the most thorough or detailed of reviews. But I do not want to give away the entire plot or spoilers. I loved going into it blind. I realize this type of read isn't for everyone. But I will say that, though I am not generally a Sci-Fi person, I loved this story because it wasn't so much about &#34;aliens&#34; but about human interactions, human agendas, right and wrong and gray areas. It made me think but also entertained me. It made me wonder but also gave me answers, and sometimes those answers were not what I expected. I look forward to more in Ender's world.ovoking and far deeper than I had expected.<br /><br />My students, for the most part, also really enjoyed this book, even with it's brutality (though one student decided it was too much for her).

B00F87ZUYG|3.0|One can only take the zombie theme so far before it starts getting repetitive and this series has definitely hit that mark.  Unfortunately, it has failed to keep fresh and now the conflicts are not as exciting.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|I have a Nikon D70 with two lenses (one 50mm & one 70mm) and the bag is big enough that all three pieces fit inside comfortably, as long as one of the lenses is actually on the camera. There are two large pockets on the side of the bag that I use for my camera charger, remote and memory cards.  The padding on the inside is plush and soft and the strap on the bag, as well as the handle, are very comfortable.  The zipper is smooth and the red/orange line on the outside matches the material on the inside beautifully, as well as the rubberized zipper handles.
B000YGIIPO|4.0|Cute and clever. It was a slow start and probably a poor introduction to Pratchett, but the quirky characters, and exciting plot turns kept me going, and the ending was so meaningful and apt!
1250038820|5.0|This is a beautiful printed piece, as well as containing such amazing, interesting and thought provoking pictures and captions. The kind of book you pick up over and over again.
B00DAPOHU6|4.0|And when I write &#34;same old Jack,&#34; I mean that as a compliment.<br /><br />Jack Johnson has remained one of my favorite artists over the past decade by consistently delivering simple, but evocative, lyrics over his unique blend of guitar driven surf-folk music that is exists in some sort of genre of its own.<br /><br />This record is largely in that same style. If anything it probably relates back to his first record, Brushfire Fairytales, in the sense that there are a handful of upbeat, jam along songs.<br /><br />As a fan, I'm not probably not the best to judge here. I would say if you are a fan of Jack Johnson, I can't think of too many reasons why you wouldn't like this album. On the other hand, I gave it 4 stars just on the basis that he isn't breaking any new ground with this record. Artistically, that may matter to some, and I don't think that is totally unfair. But for those of us just happy to have some new Jack Johnson tunes to listen to, this album delivers what we've come to expect.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Although the story line is not classical Star Trek, this movie is very enjoyable to watch.  I highly recommend it to anyone.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thought it was a really interesting way to look at those who are living with cancer. To see that they have good days and bad days and to actually be able to understand how it really affects their lives makes you connect to the book in a real, and unexpected, way. It's SO so so good.

B007JWKLMO|4.0|So anyone, like me, who is a George Harrison fan probably knows much of the information in this collection.  However if you're like me you always love hearing the stories again from the people who lived the experiences with George.  There's a lot of information here about his involvement in Formula 1 as well as his U.S. tour back in the 70's.  I enjoyed seeing the film of his U.S. tour which brought back a lot of memories as I was an impressionable 11 year old when I saw him on this tour.<br /><br />Someone else wrote that there is also a question of what subjects you cover in the case of a life like George's.  Like Attenborough's Gandhi, Scorcese with George's family captures the essence of the man even though the man was incredibly complex and beloved throughout the world.

006202406X|1.0|Let me just say that I loved Divergent and Insurgent. They were two of my favorite books. I eagerly anticipated Allegiant with high hopes and high expectations. I'm sad to say that I did not enjoy this book. I trudged through most of it, reading only to get to the end.<br /><br />I know she wanted to give some backstory and have it all make sense, but I wasn't expecting to read HUNDREDS of pages of backstory, with massive blocks of dialogue talking about \\"pure\\" genes, \\"damaged\\" genes, and more odd gene stuff and giving explanations for everything. There was something special about the story without all of the gene stuff. There was something special about being Divergent...but now? No. She even said in an interview that she decided 'divergence' would mean nothing at all. Why?! It just doesn't make sense.<br /><br />I'm just extremely disappointed.... not only with the first 500 pages of the book but with the complete lack of distinction between Tris's voice and Tobias's voice, they both sounded completely the same. At times I would have to go back to the beginning of the chapter to see who was telling the story. Tobias no longer deserved to have the name 'Four' - he somehow transformed into a whiny, petty little boy. I also have a problem with the ending. In all of her interviews she kept saying she was confident it was the perfect ending and the right ending, but I think she knew it would be disappointing for many of the readers and I'm not alone when I say it could've been way less depressing.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br />The more I think about the ending, the more it makes me feel like Tris got cheated. Veronica said in an interview that Tris earned a powerful ending. And I agree, she did, but if she really wanted to give Tris a powerful ending, she should've given her a happy life with Tobias. That's what she really earned. She always wrote about how Tris never had an alone moment with Tobias, how Tris lost so many people, that she ran from one danger andinto the next, and was constantly making impossible decisions. What Tris deserved was a freakin' break from her exhausting, tragic life... she didn't earn her death, she earned a chance at a better LIFE. The ending didn't do her justice, not for her marathon of fighting and constant loss. I just don't get it.<br />***END OF SPOILERS***<br /><br />I never imagined I would give Allegiant one star. Veronica wrote two great books, but I feel like what happened in the last book was just so, SO COMPLETELY WRONG, so unexpected, so disjointed from the first two books. I'm upset with how it all ended and how she tried to erase the special things about the series, the things that we fell in love with in the first place. It was a complete betrayal to the readers. Some people say that authors don't owe the readers anything, that it's their book and they can do whatever they want with it. But that's not true. When an author has a book published and opens it up to the public, it is no longer just the author's book, it belongs to all of the readers - customers who pay for the book and trust the author to write something satisfying, not something perfect, but not something completely unexpected and disappointing. We've all invested a lot of time into this series, fallen in love with the characters, just to have it end like it did. Just no.<br /><br />It used to be special to me, but this book pretty much just ruined everything.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is just such a funny book it will make you laugh on every page so after all great book
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|A good academic read, which I might have passed on if not for the infamous Fox interview. The only flaw is probably inevitable, and certainly a matter of perspective, and that is the academic nature of the author's writing style. Still, it is an excellent history of the evolution of Jesus the Christ, from Jesus of Nazareth. It is not an indictment of Christianity, nor is it a religious recruitment effort. It is a relatively dispassionate and well-researched textbook.

B00F1CRSKM|5.0|Writing a review for Arcade Fire's latest has been a daunting task; on one hand you have the Greek myth of Orpheus that much of the lyrical content in Reflektor centers around and very quickly an album review becomes an undergraduate lesson in Greek mythology and its underlying influence on Western culture. On the other? The expansive and impressive array of instruments, recording techniques, vocal harmonies, and blissful bombardment of melodic tone that pervades throughout the entire album. The end result is Reflektor, the fourth studio album by Montreal based Arcade Fire that transcends genre and medium; an amalgamation of music and literature that enjoyably educates the senses whilst providing relaxation and reflection. Simply put, one of the best albums I've ever heard.<br /><br />Before Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, and before Romeo and Juliet, there was Orpheus and Eurydice. Depending on publisher, website, or cigarette smoking historian, the stories of Orpheus can differ greatly. For the purpose of eventually wanting to talk about a music album an extremely short abridged version will have to suffice. Orpheus himself is credited in ancient Greek as being one of the most legendary musicians and poets, his lyre and voice capable of creating such beautiful sound and prose that animals, men, and gods themselves would become charmed and forego anything else save the sound of the lyre. Numerous tales exist of Orpheus using his lyre to escape danger, including when traveling by the island home to the sirens sisters of Iliad fame. Whereas Odysseus used wax to drown the sirens sound, Orpheus himself overcame them and saved the ship by providing a more enticing tune. Enter Eurydice, daughter of Appolo and wood nymph. The two are married and during the wedding day feast Eurydice is bitten by a viper and quickly dies. This begins the journey of Orpheus to the underworld to plead his case to Hades for Eurydice's return. An epic journey ensues with Orpheus charming Cerebrus (hellhound, gate guardian), and striking a deal with Hades to return to the upper realm with Eurydice, with one condition: Orpheus must walk in front of Eurydice the whole way and is not allowed to look back until reaching the upper realm. The album cover for Reflektor is exactly this: Eurydice walking behind Orpheus with her arms around him amid their way back to the upper realm (See I'm really going somewhere with this).<br /><br />Tragically, near the end of the journey Orpheus doubts Eurydice's presence and begins to wonder whether she is merely an apparition or that perhaps Hades has deceived him. Doubting when crossing the portal, Orpheus tempts fate and turns around to look upon his face, it is indeed Eurydice but since she has not crossed the threshold she disappears and returns to the underworld. The rest of the story is history as they say, Orpheus becomes a raging alcoholic (not really) and spurns the gods the rest of his day. \\"Porno\\" and \\"Afterlife\\" capture this loss in an incredible way. Why is it the greatest love story? Because the two don't end up together. Why should you care about this? Trust me, it will help you in deciphering latter half of Reflektor.<br /><br />Reflektor starts strong, the title track being a lengthy 7 minute jaunt that reverberates in true Arcade Fire fashion, layered lo-fi distortion in and out of an ever advancing drum beat accompanied by various forms of percussion, horn, piano, and alternating vocals from Win Butler and R&eacute;gine Chassagne (R&eacute;gine's elegantly in French). There is a very distinct and danceable foundation established in \\"Reflektor\\" that comes and goes all throughout the album. James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem fame co-produced the album along with Markus Dravis and influence by the former is noticeable: These are some of Arcade Fire's grooviest and collectively lengthiest tracks. \\"Flashbulb Eyes,\\" the albums shortest and perhaps most lyrically straightforward track is a mix of rock reggae with a dash of rumba. In an interview with Rolling Stone earlier in the year Win Butler stated that traveling to Haiti had a strong influence on the album's sound and I find it rather enjoyable. The Haitian influence is strongest throughout the first side of the album, but rock fans don't lose faith, there's enough to go around.\\"Normal Person\\" quickly descends from a piano rag ballad to a guitar driven guitar, drum, and on careful listen one can even hear bongos. \\"Here Comes The Night Time\\" is a compelling introspective about the men and women traversing the world selling religion. Arcade Fire has never been shy about alternating instruments and inserting electronic \\"noise\\" or horn in the most appropriate places. These aren't looping beats or guitar riffs however, but planned instrumental nuances that add a subtle layer of depth that is appreciated. Whether living room acoustics or headphones, this album is seriously busy.<br /><br />Around \\"Awful Sound\\" is when our Greek education comes into play as the remainder of Reflektor plays out like the Orpheus saga. Orpheus sings to Eurydice in \\"Awful Sound\\" and Eurydice returns the favor in the next track, \\"It's Never Over.\\" The two tracks in quick succession are more than satisfactory and leagues beyond anything the writing in anything being released in movie theaters. Those music fans who might find phobia at the thought of a sad love story driving an album album take solace in the opinion that musically the back half of Reflektor is just as strong if not better than the first half of the album. There is still plenty of rock and indie soundscapes to be had and nothing comes across contrived or melodramatic.<br /><br />Since I've quite literally spoiled the story for you I'll leave you to your own devices to lyrically interpret the remainder of the album's themes and soundscapes. I just hope you enjoy it as much as I have. Every generation has iconic bands and musicians and if Arcade Fire hasn't already been identified at the forefront of this current generation then this magnum opus should help them reach that plateau.

B001992NUQ|5.0|This movie is one of my top ten favourite movies, I love the way every character in the movie performs.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|SimpleRockets is a very interesting game based on the science and physics behind rockets and space travel. You design and build your own customized rockets, and then test them out by launching them on missions that involve various realistic objectives. Think of it as a more advanced version of Bad Piggies. The tutorial is very detailed yet easy to follow. Definitely run through it if you can, it's without a doubt one of the best tutorials I've come across in a while.<br /><br />The graphics are good - might not be super flashy, but it does its job nicely. The tutorial and missions are logically laid out. There is only one permission (network access), which presumably is used for the links to the developer's other apps. The game has a very polished feel to it. You can definitely see that the developers care about and take pride in their work. This game reminds me of those fun interactive exhibits at museums. In fact, it would not be out of place if I came across it as a small interactive exhibit at say the National Air & Space Museum in DC.<br /><br />I think the normal $1.99 price is fair, and as the free app of the day, it's definitely a worthy addition to your app collection - especially if you are a geek like me who love science and rockets!

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|One of the best books I've read this year. Easy read with quality, well developed characters. Good job Rachel Joyce.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I want to start by saying I appreciate the end of the book because it was true to character of Tris and the world Roth created.  What I did not love was the lack of cohesiveness in the series.  Roth said that she planned this end from the beginning but there are many inconsistencies that make Allegiant feel disjointed from the other two books.  The way Natalie Prior acted prior to the attacks and the things she said to Tris during the attacks in Divergent make no sense with her knowledge base.  It would have been nice if there were nuggets of truth hidden that if re-read suggest the truth, but when I re-read the first two there is no evidence or ties to the final book. Also Caleb never really explains his actions and I spent the majority of the last two books waiting for his explanation granted Tris really did not give him a chance, but there was an opportunity for it when they were speaking candidly towards the end of Allegiant but still no explanation.  I enjoyed the content of the book and the series as a whole.  Any critique I have is not what is in Allegiant or the series as a whole but what is not in it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I feel The Shining is horror and Doctor Sleep is more science fiction. As much as I loved the Shining, Doctor Sleep felt like a different genre. Still, I was interested in the story, I was engaged in Danny's life and I was happy with the outcome. I still prefer The Shining, though.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I knew it!  I TOTALLY CALLED THE ENDING!!!<br /><br />Allegiant is told in alternating perspectives, unlike Divergent and Insurgent, which were told in only Tris's point of view.  This one alternates between Tris and Four.  I liked and didn't like this.  I didn't think that Four's voice was distinct enough and I sometimes had to really think about whose perspective I was reading from.<br /><br />Okay, so, I was not crazy about this book as a whole.  At least, not nearly as crazy as I was for Divergent and Insurgent!  I took issue with a lot of things and, honestly, I just wasn't captivated by it.  I didn't feel a very strong connection to the characters, which was strange considering how much I loved them in the previous books.  And I even re-read the first two books right before Allegiant so that I wouldn't lose that connection (or in order to refresh my connection).  But, I just wasn't feelin' it in this one.<br /><br />I found Tris and Four's relationship as being very dysfunctional in this book.  I mean, I suppose it started in Insurgent.  But, it was even worse in Allegiant.  They seemed to think they could solve everything by just making out rather than actually talking about it.  Every time they started to have a meaningful conversation and I thought things were actually going to be resolved, they would just start kissing instead!  No wonder they have so many issues.  These are not the keys to a successful relationship!  They also didn't seem to have much respect for each other.  If they did, they sure didn't act like it.<br /><br />About half-way through the book, I just wanted to get to the end so that it was over with and I could move on.  I really wasn't into it, which is very unfortunate.  I was so excited for this book, as was everyone.  I also kind of felt like the story was a bit of a mess.  It was a little all over the place and just felt messy.<br /><br />The last 15% was definitely my favourite part of the whole novel.  It was actually able to keep my attention and had me wanting to keep turning those pages.  Unlike the first 75%, other than to just get the book over and done with.  And I actually really liked the ending, even though I know a lot of people didn't.  I really hope they don't change the ending in the movie adaptation.  But I have a feeling they might.  Also, I don't know why so many people are soooo shocked by the ending.  C'mon people, it was inevitable.my attention and had me wanting to keep turning those pages.

1476727651|5.0|It is a sequel to the book, so for best reading do read The Shining first.  And I found it excellent and loved King's current vision of Danny Torrence's future.  As stated, definitely not so scarey as the original, but a fair and super exposition of Dan's future.  Now, since the library copies are all \\"lost\\", I guess I'll need to rummage through my old long ago packed away books and find my original copy for a re-read.  And since I'm from the author's New England heritage and of the same age group, it was fun reading his notes at the end.

B00BSBR9N6|3.0|The Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion was an interesting story.  Perhaps because I'd read another review that likened it to the Big Bang Theory TV show, I couldn't get that comparison out of my mind.  Professor Don Tillman is a genetics professor, and it's hinted at that he has Asperger's Syndrome.  I have one son with Asperger's and another with Autism so I am very familiar with the personality traits and characteristics.  The Professor has decided to start \\"the Wife Project\\" because he feels it's time to get married.  He puts together a 16 page double-sided questionnaire to filter out the unsuitable candidates.  Rosie is sent to see him by a friend, and since she is not a suitable candidate, Don ends up starting \\"the Rosie Project\\" instead to help her find her biological father.<br /><br />There were parts of this book that were funny, but I don't think it was hysterically funny.  It could have been funnier.  I found the professor's thought pattern habit of guessing everyone's age and BMI when he met them to be tiresome after a while.  That was the main Asperger's trait that seemed to stick.  He even loosened up his rigid schedule and habits as the story went on. The characters were from Australia, and I didn't get that until they were on a plane to New York, and then I had to back track and try to figure out where they were coming from.  I wish there had been more description of Don's physical appearance other than with a different haircut, he looked a bit like Gregory Peck.  Maybe a better description would have erased the image of Sheldon Cooper from my mind's eye every time I tried to visualize the story.<br /><br />I liked the book, but I didn't love it.  I kept waiting for something else to happen.  It just felt like it was lacking something. I wish it had been less like Big Bang and there had been more romance or humor or more something.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Beautiful and Classy. Durable. People notice it immediately. Could be the nicest watch I have bought in years. Will have it and wear it.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|What a delight! The melodies are so terrific, so varied, so new while having lots of references to popular music from the last 70 years or more. Love the compositions -- you hear the individual parts. Great voices, great harmonies. I love that the lyrics often show an emotional distress in contrast to the blithe melodies. I also love the sonic treats -- this is an album that definitely rewards good speakers or headphones.<br /><br />No song on this album matches the charm of \\"Oxford Comma\\", from their first album, yet as I heard more and more of the album, I grew in the conviction that these guys are musical geniuses.

B004P8JPS6|3.0|Another good read by lee child.  Slow at times., but child is still a very good story teller. A recommended read for lee child fans.
B004SIP8BG|4.0|if you have read any of the other reviews before you get to this one than you will know the blu-ray is not as \\"sharp\\" as the dvd.<br /><br />Even having read this information I decided to purchase the blu-ray. We recently (within the last month) put in a home theater with a projector and black diamond screen.<br /><br />I was excited to see the color story in this film. Unfortunately the lines were not as crisp and I was sad. It just didn't \\"pop\\" the way I remembered from the actual release.<br /><br />And before you say it's the projector, I can promise it isn't-- We've watched a few other blu-rays on it and it has been very clear/crisp.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has never disappointed me.  I'm not one to be interested in history, especially war!  The interpersonal relationships between 4 families, one each from England, Russia, Germany, & the US, intertwining through two world wars was quite an engrossing history lesson!!...one which I looked forward to reading more and more each and every time I picked this book up. I highly recommend it!
B0001CNRBG|4.0|This is a movie that is obviously based on a play and it is very enjoyable to watch.  The acting is outstanding and the scenery makes for a great combination.  We stayed at the Hertiage House where the movie was filmed on our Honeymoon and watching it brought back wonderful memories.  The evolution of the two movie chacters over the years makes for a great story.

0316204366|4.0|In The Tipping Point (2000) Malcolm Gladwell introduced us to the turning points at the creation of a trend. In Blink (2005) he told us how we act on instinct without thinking and Outliers (2008) he said you had to work hard to achieve success - about 10,000 hours of practising should do it. In David & Goliath (2013) everything is not as it seems. Advantage can sometimes be a disadvantage and vice versa.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Gladwell said that he wanted to write this book because, \\"I felt that we continue to make all kinds of mistakes, whether it's in our foreign policy or our educational policy, based on a misunderstanding of what works; of what's advantageous. I also thought it was time to write a more sophisticated account of where power and authority really come from and that in every crisis there is an incredible opportunity for growth.\\"<br /><br />Gladwell offers insights about the \\"legitimacy of authority\\", discussing policing in Brownsville New York, the flawed military tactics deployed in Northern Ireland and the \\"Three Strikes and You're Out\\" judicial system of California. Couple that with a polemic on the flaws within our education system, a journey through the Deep South and the civil rights protests of the early 60s and you've got enough to get a debate going.<br /><br />Through these pieces he weaves and tells the stories of the people who were there who made the difference \\"the misfits, the underdogs who battled the Giants\\"<br /><br />Gladwell starts his discourse with the David and Goliath story and acknowledges that the former Israeli minister of defence Moshe Dayan--the architect of Israel's victory in the 1967 Six-Day War--also wrote an essay on the story of David and Goliath. According to Dayan,<br /><br />\\"David fought Goliath not with inferior but (on the contrary) with superior weaponry; and his greatness consisted not in his being willing to go out into battle against someone far stronger than he was. But in his knowing how to exploit a weapon by which a feeble person could seize the advantage and become stronger.\\"<br /><br /> Education<br /><br />So it is on this theme of advantage and all is not what it seems that leads him into education and the surprising statistic that \\"77% of Americans think that it makes more sense to use taxpayer money to lower class sizes than to raise teachers' salaries\\"<br /><br />Gladwell argues that \\"there isn't a single profession in the world that has increased its numbers over the past two decades by as much or as quickly or at such expense as teaching has. That is precisely what many industrialized countries have done in recent years, it costs so much to hire extra teachers and build them classrooms that there is precious little money left over to pay teachers. As a result, the salaries of teachers, relative to other professions, have steadily fallen over the past fifty years\\"<br /><br />He argues, \\"Humans are more influenced in decision-making by innate emotions than rational thought\\" (as the many books we have covered on cognitive biases and the recent emerging discoveries in the field of neuroscience). As Frank Carson says it's the way he tells them.<br /><br />The fixation around the world that smaller class sizes = better education and better students is he says not proven. Class-size reduction \\"steals away the peers that struggling students learn from. They are awkward and self-conscious and anxious about seeming too smart. Getting them to engage, to move beyond simple question-and-answer sessions with their teacher, can be \\"like pulling teeth.\\"<br /><br />Why were smaller classes wanted he asks? \\"One answer lies in the politics of the educational world--in the power of teachers and their unions, and in the peculiarities of the way schools are funded. Because the people and countries that are wealthy enough to pay for things like really small classes have a hard time understanding that the things their wealth can buy might not always make them better off.\\"<br /><br />Civil Rights<br /><br />Birmingham's Alabama other nickname was Bombingham. \\"In Birmingham,\\" Diane McWhorter writes in Carry Me Home, \\"The surest way to stop a crime wave was to go out and shoot a few suspects.\\" The story behind the famous photograph (above) of  a black teenager (Walter Gasden) being attacked by a police dog in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963 -- Gladwell demonstrates that the weak are not always what they seem. In fact, as he learned, the 15-year-old in the picture was a spectator, not a demonstrator. Closer scrutiny of the photograph, showed the police trying to hold the dogs back. But that's only the tail of the story: Civil rights organiser Wyatt Walker was looking for publicity-worthy confrontations, and Gladwell explains how he tricked the local authorities into confusing bystanders with demonstrators to heighten the sense of alarm.<br /><br /> Northern Ireland & The Troubles<br /><br /> In those years, when the world was exploding in violence, Gladwell argues that everyone read Nathan Leites and Charles Wolf, Rebellion and Authority.<br /><br />He says, \\"It became the blueprint for the war in Vietnam, and for how police departments dealt with civil unrest, and for how governments coped with terrorism. Its conclusion was simple: Fundamental to our analysis is the assumption that the population, as individuals or groups, behaves \\"rationally,\\" that it calculates costs and benefits to the extent that they can be related to different courses of action, and makes choices accordingly... getting insurgents to behave is fundamentally a math problem. If there are riots in the streets of Belfast, it's because the costs to rioters of burning houses and smashing windows aren't high enough. And when Leites and Wolf said that \\"influencing popular behaviour requires neither sympathy nor mysticism,\\" what they meant was that nothing mattered but that calculation. If you were in a position of power, you didn't have to worry about how lawbreakers felt about what you were doing. You just had to be tough enough to make them think twice.\\" QED for all the problems in N.I. then?<br /><br />He goes on, \\"When people in authority want the rest of us to behave, it matters--first and foremost--how they behave. This is called the \\"principle of legitimacy,\\" and legitimacy is based on three things. First of all, the people who are asked to obey authority have to feel like they have a voice--that if they speak up, they will be heard. Second, the law has to be predictable. There has to be a reasonable expectation that the rules tomorrow are going to be roughly the same as the rules today. And third, the authority has to be fair. It can't treat one group differently from another\\"<br /><br />Three strikes and you are out<br /><br />The theme of authority runs throughout the book and Gladwell deals with the introduction of the \\"Three strikes and you are out\\" legislation after the pivotal murder of Michael Reynolds daughter in 1993.Twenty years of debate have perhaps finally come to a conclusion with a repeal of the legislation in 2012.<br /><br />Gladwell argues that the \\"Inverted U Curve\\" - basically the Law of Diminishing Returns applies. \\"You and I are sensitive to increased punishment, because you and I are people with a stake in society. But criminals aren't. Where no viable alternative to crime exists, there clearly is little point in dwelling on the potentially negative consequences of offending. It should come as no surprise, then, to learn that the offenders usually preferred to ignore the possible risk and concentrate instead on the anticipated reward\\"<br /><br />He goes on, \\"What if the relationship between punishment and crime was also an inverted U? In other words, what if--past a certain point--cracking down on crime stopped having any effect on criminals and maybe even started to make crime worse? But remember, the logic of the inverted-U curve is that the same strategies that work really well at first stop working past acertain point, and that's exactly what many criminologists argue happens with punishment.\\"<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />When it comes down to it there are two types of people in this world. People who like Malcolm Gladwell and those that don't and in this book both sets of supporters will find what they are looking for. His research is perhaps not deep enough, he cherry picks his findings. He is a journalist after all not a scientist. As Gladwell says of himself \\"my books are gateway drugs - they lead you to the hard stuff.\\"<br /><br />While the book focuses on the underdog and the misfit I think the real value is what it asks us about behaviour.

B008602KQI|4.0|Good high-level reflection of the book. Somewhat superficial and sloppy. Mostly action, little reflection. Woudl like to see actors talk more. Only several dialogs were selected for the movie. Many themes not covered at all (like living poor in District 12). On theother hand, it would need to be probably 3 hours just to cover all basics..
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Received it very quickly. Love the movie! It was really great to get it brand new and be able to watch it whenever I want.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|Earlier this month, I was recommend a book from my in-laws called [[ASIN:B00DV9Q23Q How to Build Up Your Child Instead of Repairing Your Teenager]] by Brian Tracy, a short and concise book on parenting techniques that seem to be working for many parents today. After purchasing it, I saw this book as one of the suggestions at the bottom of the page and after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try. I have 2 boys and always thought our children's character makes a huge impact on their lives but as parents, how are we supposed to develop character? Isn't that something that's built-in genetically? Well, that's what you'll find out.<br /><br />The general consensus of this book is this: If we want our children to succeed, we're probably teaching them the wrong things and not giving them the optimal tools to succeed based on conventional wisdom.<br /><br />The author talks about a concept called Cognitive Hypothesis, our misconception that if there is one thing that could matter the most in a child's success is his/her IQ .  But when you take a closer look at education and the science of what seems to be working most effectively, it's things like grit (mental toughness & stick-to-it-iveness), passion, curiosity, optimism and self-control. Those appear to be making a much bigger impact than IQ by itself.<br /><br />Paul provides proof from a particular study stating this fact: even though High school grads and GED holders were generally the same IQ level, high school grads had a much higher probability of success than GED holders because in order to graduate from high school, they needed to have persistence and perseverance to accomplish all that was part of being a high school student/graduate.<br /><br />Author also talks about teaching non-cognitive skills such as character and the debate whether or not that's really teachable.  He explains we're aware that many of these character strengths matter, they're shaped by the child's environment, how a child grows up, by their parents behavior and skillset.  But we're mostly unaware of how educators and parents could actually TEACH them to our children.<br /><br />In the end however, Paul does talk about some programs and initiatives that could be quite helpful in accomplishing this task but there still are no proven ways to teach these techniques as of yet, and for them to become policy in schools. The book takes many turns and twists on our conventional wisdom for both parents and educators. I would say the book was very useful and unlike any type of parenting book I'd ever read. I found the 1st half much more useful than the 2nd half though.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|That did not just happen.<br /><br />Okay, I originally gave this book three stars out of a misguided sense of loyalty for the series, but every time I think about Allegiant, I have a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. That's obviously not deserving of three stars. Fortunately for this book, I only give one star ratings to books I can't finish, so I had to bump it down to two.<br /><br />The rest of this review is going to be one giant spoiler-rant. You've been warned.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />I finished this book with a noxious knot of conflicting emotions in the pit of the stomach that literally made me nauseous. I've been so attached to these characters for over two years now and to see them mutilated in this final book was devastating. The alternating points of view shredded the personal identities Tris and Four had developed over the series, as Tris and Four's voices began to lose any distinction. I found myself flipping back to the beginning of the chapter several times to double check whose chapter I was reading. And Four- sexy, strong, courageous Four- was completely lost. His chapters revealed him to be sniveling, afraid, and weak. Did I want Four to have multiple dimensions and layers? Did I hope to see a realistic portrayal of a man who is dealing with the emotional and psychological repercussions of abuse? Yes and Yes. Absolutely. But instead of layers, Allegiant's Four was pure whine, pure emotional drivel, and retained none of the strength and bravery Divergent and Insurgent's Four had. I wanted to see Four as a man with fears and scars and worries like any real person would have, but I also wanted him to have the wonderful qualities with which he made all of us fall in love with him in the first two books. But no.<br /><br />And then there were plot holes, of course. Strange science. Strange motivations that don't make a whole lot of sense. Easy fixes for decades-old conflicts. But I'll let you come upon all the plot holes as you read and decide whether or not it's worth it to leap across.<br /><br />But I have to rant about the ending. Just a bit. Because, you see, I love tragic endings. Tragic characters who sacrifice themselves for the good of others and leave a wretched lover behind to mourn, but knowing every tragic thing that happened, happened for a reason. And I get that sometimes, in the real world, bad things happen for no reason at all. But Veronica Roth had the power to choose any ending she saw fit. And the only purpose I can fathom for her ending the trilogy with the heroine's death is to separate her book from other ya / dystopians. And that's not a good enough reason. Because Tris deserved better. Her death scene was unnecessary and hurried; there was no passion, no reflection, no one to take notice, but the man who would be her killer. It happened, just like that. After three books. Not only did Tris deserve better, we deserved better, damn it. And every scene that took place after Tris' death was a rushed mess of Roth trying to fill in gaping holes, solving problems with no real resolution.<br /><br />Oh, but there was an epilogue! Two years later and everything is hunky-dory! Four is facing his fear of heights! So that's fine, then. Right? Wrong.<br /><br />RIP Tris. RIP Divergent and Insurgent's Four. RIP my love for this series.

1476734941|5.0|I have never done well with daily calorie restriction. I find it much easier to take one for the team one to two days a week.  If you choose to fast (500 calories) on a busy day, expect it to be easy and for the time to pass quickly. If you choose to fast on a slower day (such as a weekend day), expect a lesson in mindfulness, which is not a bad thing!  I did have a hard time the first few weeks right around the 4 pm hour, but that has since subsided, and I actually look forward to fast days now. I started the diet May 26, 2013 only doing one day a week. To speed weight loss up a bit, about two months ago, I went to two days a week, knowing that I would only have to do this temporarily once I hit my goal. I am happy to say that I have lost 16 pounds so far (about 2/3 of a pound a week which is the way it is supposed to be done). Having added a second day, I expect to lose about 3/4 of a pound to a pound a week.  And with this lifestyle, the maintenance plan is so very easy.  You just pick one day a week, and commit to that as a day of \\"digestive resting\\" (and you still get to eat 500 calories). It is so simple and does not require a lot of thinking.<br /><br />I still have about 25-27 more pounds to go, but with my slow and steady resolve, patience and adhering to this plan, which is the most reasonable plan I have ever tried, I will be at my goal weight sometime between the end of May, 2014 and the beginning of August, 2014.  If you expect a rapid weight loss, this one may not be for you (as you will likely eat a couple hundred more calories the day after a fast). But if you want a slow and steady program that guarantees an excellent result and an easy to follow maintenance plan (not to mention the anti-inflammatory benefits fasting offers), then expect to have hit a gold mine! I feel grateful every day to have found this plan, as it has been the only plan that I do not feel burned out on and that makes long-term sense to me. Thank you.

The founder had read it and realized that there was excellent practical advice for developing his business model in there.<br /><br />I have since purchased and read the book. It provides an excellent structure for early stage companies to develop and test their models. I now recommend it to most early stage businesses I encounter. There are some excellent tools available online to be used in conjunction with the book<br /><br />Richard McLean
1451666179|5.0|Allie is a wonderful author and blogger, everything is hilarious or touching or slightly creepy/weird. This book covers a lot of previous material with some new things and is thicker than expected, but all of it is filled with her unique and amazing outlook and experiences. Highly recommend.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I loved this film--I loved the book, but it's been a while since I've read it, so I didn't mind all of the differences. I think this was made beautifully. It was also a definite perk to watch on Amazon Instant Video. I always forget to return rented videos, so Amazon Instant Video works out great for me!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I enjoyed Pam's sense of humor and the way she writes makes this so easy to read. And I know it's not the author's fault, I'm frustrated that I didn't get the results I had hoped from trying the experiments. Will definitely re-read another time and try them again!
B000P7V45S|5.0|DTS 5.1 sounds great. Bonus interview is cool, but short. Videos are sweet. Was not expecting the 1976 concert though. Is that Bill Bruford on drums??? I think it's got like 6 or 7 songs, including stuff from Selling England, Lamb, Foxtrot and definitely some TotT stuff. If you're a fan of this album and you don't have the CD/DVD, get it!!!<br />The stereo mix on the CD is also fine... :)

0399159347|4.0|This was a great book. Fun to read, with a great twist. I really enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good book.
1932100660|5.0|This book is yet another really great book to read if you are interested in how our food industry and overall health and wellness in this country is falling apart.
1449305172|5.0|I'm an Austin area entrepreneur and had Ash's book recommended to me when I was about to launch my second company. As with most business books, I tossed it on the bookshelf and waited until work slowed down so I'd have time to skim through the chapters. It sat untouched, and I wish I would have dropped everything to read it that day.<br /><br />That company failed, but the lessons I learned, and applied too late, from Running Lean have stuck. It's now the first text I recommend to prospective entrepreneurs and one I revisit frequently to remember how to test theories, construct experiments, and validate my learning. This book is practical, it's against the norm, and it's a vital tool that any business review use daily as they build their products.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|On time as promised.....I would use the company again! A great show with a great cast..couldn't ask for more! At all!
B000N5F6OW|5.0|Takes you to Africa. This is my families favorite movies and we can't wait to share it with each generation.
B000002AHM|5.0|Great recording.  You'll feel like you were a member of the lucky audience; the dynamic playing and atmosphere comes through every time you listen.
1449305172|4.0|Running Lean is an excellent place to start for individuals looking to learn more about the tenants of lean startup and lean innovation.  Ash breaks things down and gives helpful structures to give anyone the essential tools you need to begin customer development.  Once you've read his book, you'll be equipped to get more out of some of the other lean resources in the industry.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Can become very addictive...if you have things to do, Don't open. That being said, it does tend to freeze up from time to time, which is annoying as hell
1449305172|5.0|The Lean Startup is a great new business paradigm for new business and new ventures inside large businesses. This book is full of practical methods for implementing this methodology. Charts, worksheets, step by step guidance to how to make this work for you. Anyone starting a new company or a new product line or even revamping an old product line should read this.
0804137501|4.0|I finished Remote last week and I recommend it (I received an early copy from their publisher). I'm happy to say it's a clear, short, solid book of arguments for using remote work to your advantage. It has a nice section of common excuses, with refutations, and sound arguments about how many opportunities there are to help your company by allowing remote workers. They discuss the unnecessary pain of commuting, the improved access to talent from other places and how the right kinds of employees benefit from greater flexibility. All things I observed at WordPress.com, and which I argue for at times in my own book. If you're looking to convince a boss or executive to give remote work a try, this is an excellent place to start.
B008JFUR10|4.0|In the theaters, Pacific Rim was awe inspiring.  No it didn't have oscar worthy acting, and it was never going to win for best screenplay either, but it didn't need to.  That wasn't what Pacific Rim was about.  This movie was a loving homage to the kaiju and mecha genre that if nothing else American audiences would recognize from the last 5-10 minutes of any episode of Power Rangers.  Gigantic robots fist punching even bigger monsters before whipping out ungodly huge swords to slice them apart or plasma cannons to blow them away.  A lot of movies try to hide the fact that they are doing something simplistic like this by watering everything down with unneeded story or angst to try and be \\"deep\\".  Pacific Rim does not.  You get just enough story and characters to support the giant robot fights and give you a bit of a breather between fights, and it was truly glorious.<br /><br />The problem with this DVD/Blu-Ray/etc is that the movie benefited GREATLY from being on the big screen.  250 foot tall robots simply look better on the big screen than they do on the small one, and the sound track, while still good coming out of your television is nothing compared to how it rang out in the theaters.<br /><br />As for the things it could control, this set had a lot of fun stuff tucked away in it.  My biggest complaint about the layout though is that the location of the extras seemed counter intuitive to me.  It came with two disks (well 4 disks, 2 DVD and 2 Blu-Ray), one labeled Movie and one labeled Extras.  I put the extras disk in first as I had seen the film three times in theaters, and was greatly disappointed by how little there was of value on it.  Then a few days later I put the movie disk in to watch it, and found all of the awesome extras I had been wanting the first time around.  Why were all of the best extras not on the disk labeled Extras?  Is there a 1 disk version floating around out there with all of this and they just scraped up some additional mediocre material for a hand waved second disk?<br /><br />Regardless, this movie is a lot of fun.  In the theaters I would have given it a full 5 stars.  As a DVD/Blu-Ray, I have to dock this product one star based on the reduced experience of seeing it on the small screen and for the odd extras layout.  But please, don't let any of that stop you from buying this set.  I am waiting with baited breath for Pacific Rim 2, and strong DVD sales will help hasten that.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Never played this particular game before. Makes you think to solve all the puzzles before you can move forward. Going to try the Epilogue now...looking forward to next version
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Not worth your time. To many plot holes, subplots and weird character developments(what little character development there is). The character's voices all sounded the same...and the poor writing felt rushed.
0553385445|3.0|in many ways you could buy this follow-up and never read TWOWS, and be more ensconced in the intrigue of how the<br />FEDs busted Jordan Belfort. As I stated before he never has that &#34;come to Jesus&#34; moment, but he pretends he does<br />as long as that doesn't sour you on the story -enjoy
0375826726|5.0|Love all this young man's books!  His  books are just amazing and I have not read any of them that are not wonderful.
B0018OFN1S|5.0|Very good movie. Cant wait till number 6 comes out on bluray. And the complete collection. As a bonud they need to include the original .
B00BQ4NLC8|4.0|Like chick flicks, the husband's secret every woman will relate to and like. But the book is also much more than a chick book as it is true we would never know the path our lives would take if at every turn we choose to go left instead of right or vice versa
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Far and away his best album in years.  Full of instantly likable tracks.  If you are a McCartney fan, you will not be disappointed.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|We moved and I lost this item and just found it today, I was going to watch it and there is NO DVD!!!  I want my money back or I want a DVD!  I am not paying for nothing!!!!!!!
B0086449YA|4.0|My original review is in quotes below.  11 months later I have changed my opinion on this album.  There are at least three storytelling gems here: Seattle, Yon Two Crows and Radio City Serenade.  Other tracks have grown on me too.  Lesson for me: Don't write a review too soon.      \\"Obviously, music is a matter of taste.  I'm a huge Knopfler fan, but am disappointed with this album.  Too many tracks and lacking in his traditional storytelling songs.  Nothing even close to his past releases, each of which included 3 or 4 gems.  Again, a matter of taste.\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There is a thrill when a novel reaches in and grabs you and marches you up and down a stairway to a story straight out of the depths of creativity and madness. Without even given the reasons for living in something that is not explained, traditions and class structures, we are given very little-known of the Why, it's a fantastic experience that Hugh Howdy has given us to read.
1451629184|5.0|The book is raw truth. NOT fun, but REAL. I have to believe this person who was self-educated after a few grades in elementary school must have had some help, for the story is well written and easily understood.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Awesome book!!!! Highly recommend this book to stephen king book lovers out there!!! Definitely didn't think I could get so wrapped up in a book but I did.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a very good. keeps you wondering and reading. Makes you  eager to find out what will happen next to this odd relationship.
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|a little harder than fruit drops but is about the same thing. once you have done all the puzzles it isn't any more fun. Every level is the about the same. need to come up with many more different kinds of levels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it so crazy as in crazy awesome I love it its like totally amazing omg if I had to chose candy crush or any other game put together I would defiantly chose this one

1449305172|5.0|I really loved this book.  It was very helpful to myself and our team as we worked to launch a new business idea.  I would strongly recommend the book to anyone with a business idea who is interested in starting a new business (or launching a new product).  It is full of practical suggestions on things entrepreneurs should and should not do.  Applying Ash's lessons will save you precious time and money and significantly improve your odds of success.
0316055433|5.0|Just finished this book in about four days.....could NOT stop reading! This is one of the BEST books I have read in a long time. One so compelling and transcending that it had me thinking about the book long after it's finish. It is a scope of writing that encompasses so much it's sometimes hard to wrap your head around everything. It is the human condition incarnate.
0375760067|5.0|This is one of the saddest (and most fascinating) novels I have ever read. I bought it after watching the Hallmark movie, which followed the story. I enjoyed both immensely.
B008VBSR9G|4.0|Rhino version comes without the booklet ... 14 years and I love this cd an ... should launch an anniversary reissue of this album with some issues left out Love Is In The Air (Produced by Junior Vasquez) or the version that was produced for Dov'e L'amore ....
B009G78EE2|5.0|Love this album, even though sometimes some song get irritating fast.  Overall the album is pretty good for the two of them.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|From going from a single first person perspective to a multiple first person perspective was confusing.  Using shock value to make a point, subtly completely lost.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|I am not going to write a blown out review.  I liked the book the film is based on and the movie didn't disappoint.  It isn't your typical zombie movie and it trades gore for thrills.  Brad Pitt does another great job acting.  When will this man get an academy award!, He was totally robbed and raped for 12 Monkeys and Seven.  I think it is one of his best performances since...Basterds in  2009.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Love this show! I have all the seasons and will continue to purchase them thru Amazon when available. I highly recommend.
0345472322|5.0|I really like this book. I got it on audible and ordered this so I can read it and have my wife read it.
B000001FKY|5.0|I bought this to replace one I had lost because I really enjoyed it and would recommend to Def Leppard fans.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|this film stands the test of time.I can only say get it and laugh as the bombs fly.great transfer.and great extras.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I was surprised to hear negatives about this movie, my opinion: Well done. They picked up the re-do and worked it nicely. The crew from the re-boot is all here, including Scotty's little helper-alien. This one is nice to watch a couple of time, lots of good things going on all over the place. And hey, Cumberbach!!!
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is my favorite Pink Floyd album.This is the best sounding copy that I have heard and I must have bought about ten copies over the years.This is a album that stands the test of time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book. Great writing. Twisty and turny and really interesting insights to what's happening on the inside of people.  I love the parts that tell us &#34;what would have been&#34;.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|One of the Best Band EVER!<br />I have all their albums and each one is better then last one. Can't wait to hear more!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app. It works great, is fast and responsive. I like the auto complete and the Hints option.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The story took on a different turn than I thought it was going to be. It was a good read.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is a great game.  there are plenty of games and different levels.  also more thanone person can play oh one person can play all.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|It is not showing any detail on the game that important. Such as the jellies are not visable nor the background of the game that shows were the peaces should be so you know were they are blocked spaces. Please fix this.
B0053KWDES|5.0|So you think you have a great set of high-dollar headphones? Well, plug these in & listen for 1 minute, now try the same headphones again without the amp. No other explanation will be needed.<br />From the tiniest tinkle of a cymbal, to the serotonin-inducing bass resonance, your raw headphones just cannot compete with the transient response of this baby. If you want the perfect test: Try Clapton's well-mixed \\"Change the World\\". No subtle difference here.
B00A2H9OZS|1.0|Remember all the stuff you liked about Pitch Black? None of it is here. Riddick is just a cipher in this one with no emotions at all. If this is the best Hollyweird can do, then screw em. I'll watch their stuff online free but I won't pay em a dime.
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|It was pretty good!!  I don't think I would have given it this rating if Allen wasn't part of the movie - he is hilarious!!!
1449437524|5.0|This book was a gift for my mom, and she loves it, she keeps it on her nightstand and reads it whenever she needs a laugh.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille really knows how to write a good novel and keep the reader wanting more. It was fast moving and intriguing and I was sorry to come to the end. recommend it to anyone who lies spy novels with varied action
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Finally to kindle. very happy to see it here. finally get to join my facebook friends without using my phone. great BIG graphics....woo hoo.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|This great it is I cheat in math all the time because I have the worst teacher mis Gray Bill at deer creek middle school
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love to play this game, it keeps me entertained. I recommend it to everyone. I wish there were more games like this.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|This movie was very fun and nestalgic.  My 13 year old daughter is really into this genre of music now.
1449305172|5.0|Most of the shared insights on startup process is explaining the end or, phases of journey, however Ash concentrates on the journey also. He shares the answers for the 'How ...?' questions.<br />The book is so lean that I met with many entrepreneurs adapted his canvas without any help of 3rd person/mentor.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow!I now see what all the hoopla is about. Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down. I'm hooked. A must read. So sexy and sensual.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|This one was very different from his other books.  I like the macabre of his other books.  This one was not as good as the rest.  I did enjoy the going back and forth from the future to the past but the JFK assassination was a tragedy not a macabre type of story.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|at my school we use ipads so no pen and paper is needed.when I use evernote I can acres my notes from home to study or change them if needed.and I can have a notebook for every class.I love it!:D
B00501LD5U|5.0|Funniest movie that is good clean family fun!<br />You will want to have this movie in your repertoire for sure!
B003ITZBVI|5.0|This Blu ray shipped extremely fast and was in near perfect condition I was extremely please when I got it<br /><br />I recommend this Blu ray to any batman fan that likes a Lil dark part of it
B00EJGMCG6|5.0|The package I received DOES not look like the product pictured above! (Amazon has since removed 1 of the pictures that showed the dvd style case). Instead, I received a flimsy cardboard 4 panel digipack version where the cds/dvd are hard to remove. It can't be more than $1 to package it this way. Horrible! I was expecting a special metal tin case like pictured or at least a plastic dvd style case. Not worth the $19.88 I paid. *Update: I have changed my rating to 5 stars, since I was just disappointed with the packaging and not the content on the discs inside. Also, be aware that Amazon has other products pictured incorrectly that I have sent back: Epica: Retrospect and Nightwish: Showtime Storytime. Same reason. They show the dvd style packaging but send out the (in my opinion) far inferior cd digipack version.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|When Apple changed to the lightening connector I thought my Sangean clock radio with its 30-pin connector would not be usable with the iPhone 5. True, I could have gotten an adapter to connect 30-pin and lightening, but now that I have gotten the CableJive device I no longer need the adapter.<br /><br />Using this remarkable little CableJive device, I can connect -- via Bluetooth -- with either my 30-pin iPad (3rd gen) or my iPhone 5 (or my 30-pin iPod). Okay, so my iOS devices aren't charging (as would they have been if the device was docked directly on the clock radio's 30-pin connector), but having access to the radio's speakers is outstanding!<br /><br />I found the CableJivbe Wireless device easy to use -- just follow the simple instructions that come with it. One thing I noticed is that when I walk away (and want sound to resume through the iPad (or iPhone), even though I've turned off the radio, I need to manually set the device so that the sound comes through the iPad's (or iPhone's) speaker. It's not enough to just turn off the radio. Easy enough to do, once I figured it out.<br /><br />If you can't tell, I'm very pleased with the CableJive Wireless Bluetooth Music Receiver. If you can follow simple instructions, it should work well for you, too.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|First of all, I may say some things that may spoil the book for anyone who has not read it so readers be aware.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!<br /><br />I, like majority of the readers, was very disappointed with the ending. When I read the part where Tris died, I was so angry that I had to put the book down and take a \\"break\\" and then force myself to read the rest of the book. Maybe Veronica wanted this trilogy to be different from other popular trilogies, but she didn't have to create such a tragic ending to be unique. I know so many YA series have happy endings and rarely does any of the \\"good guys\\" die, but I felt like there were more than enough \\"good guys\\" killed in this book. Then she had to top it off with Uriah's coma/death and the topper of it all was Tris' death.<br /><br />I know in Veronica's comicon's interview, she mentioned that when she wrote this series, she was imagining her utopia. Then she realize that her utopia isn't great and she wouldn't wish for anyone to live in it. (I may had remember some things wrong) And she's right, I don't think anyone would want to live in this \\"utopia\\" where good people are killed off and the villains (Marcus and David) live. I know in real life, nothing is ever perfect but this series is fictional.<br /><br />I also can understand why she sacrificed Tris. In the book, she mentioned that Abnegation does not believe in sacrifices unless it's out of love and for the greater good. When Caleb volunteered to sacrifice his life, he was going to do it out of guilt whereas Tris sacrificed her life because of love (and she knew she had a better chance of surviving the death serum). But Veronica could just have put Tris in a long coma or have her memories erased. I still didn't think Tris should have been killed off. This series is gear towards YA and YA like happy endings. I know my last statement sounds cliche but it's the truth.<br /><br />Now that I \\"vented\\" that portion off my mind, there's other reasons I gave this book 1star.  I felt like this book was a bit monotone and flat.  The first two books kept me on edge and I couldn't put the book down.  But for Allegiant, I had to put the book down a few times because I was getting tired of reading, which rarely happens.  It seems like this book was rushed and Veronica didn't have enough time to fully utilize her creativity.  If possible, can we please have a do over?
0316017922|5.0|This book really provided some great insights about why some people are so successful.  It is a great book if you have young children and want to help set them up for future success (my opinion).  He covers a number of topics from sports to business and why some people in those arenas have been so successful. Some of it is God-given talent, but there is another component that you will be surprised (or maybe not) to learn by reading this book.  Great read.
B001XUIBNO|3.0|Having missed Chinatown during my younger days, I finally caught up with it on Amazon.<br />It had great reviews from critics and had a good run at the box office too when it was released.<br />However, seeing it now after &#34;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and other great performances by Jack Nicholson, I feel it<br />was a bit over rated.
0316010669|5.0|I am a huge Malcolm Gladwell fan so I may be a little biased. That said, I read A LOT and he is such a great researcher and storyteller. His books provide great insights to life and you will definitely learn something about life, business, relationships, and health by reading them.  I highly recommend any of his books and &#34;blink&#34; is no exception.
B0058SNKNS|4.0|Really a great comfy shoe especially for people who are always on their feet. Serves well for doctor or nurse
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I had high hopes for this game while anticipating its release.  I am a huge fan of the original temple run.  The graphics are much better and the game is slightly smoother on my GS3 but that is as far as I compliment the game.  The downside:  The twisting and winding without having to turn the device takes away from the game.  I don't like how your view of the the track is sometimes obstructed and the overall board just feels cluttered.  The original had a nice open layout.  If you liked the original you may not like Temple Run 2.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This was a truly outstanding book.<br /><br />In addition to it being an incredible testament to this young lady's courage and determination, it also provides an excellent historical, political, and social landscape of Pakistan in the past 20-30 years.
B00G32OER4|1.0|Nothing origional, NOTHING.....Seemed like a poor TV movie...<br />I agree with the reviewer that called for Amazon refunds..This movie is that BAD>>>
B005BY3XHC|3.0|I think the content of the book is actually very good, if not excellent, however, I find the style of writing to be too much of new age garble. I would much rather read the message in a way that is clear and straight to the point without all the extra noise.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I can't say much other than this is one of those rare books that fundamentally changes you and how you view the world. A must read.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|Fails in less than 2 months - Don't buy it.<br />Bought this on the 12th August 2013 - and by the end of September 2013, it was not working. The sound would not come through the headphones correctly, low and turning on and off, obviously some kind of fault internally.<br />I tried to return it but the return period for the item was only until the 14th of Sept 2013 - I can see why it is such a short return window - because the product can't last very well.<br />it was delivered promptly - so 5 stars there.<br />Impossible to find out who to contact about a replacement or refund.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Needs updates like Redstone bigger maps and more mobs and cave generation<br />And villages. Also get more stuff like mod friendly for kindle and not apps based on minecraft for kindle
B00E9ZAT4Y|5.0|This is one of the best musicals ever, and a wonderful introduction to the genre of musical for children.  Julie Andrews dazzles in this film.  She is the perfect English governess.  I saw this as a child and learned to sing all of the songs at a young age.  My brother even enjoyed this film.  Love films based on books as they have depth.  Special effects in this film are magical.  A classic musical which will never go out of style.

0761172726|5.0|for my niece. She claims she cant live w/o it- to keep her many different family members activities in line. I dont know if she bothers with the stickers, her kids are getting a little long in the tooth to care anymore, but this calendar apparently works well for them.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Unsurpassed. I have been so happy with this movie that I don't even remove it from my DVD player.  if I keep doing this I may even have to order another because I have worn the disc out.

B007ZB06OW|5.0|Well first of all the model is somewhat small but the detail on the model is crazy good on some parts. Like the gun turret has a barrel ect. It might be I bit pricy for a model kit but the quality of the kit makes it worth it

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an amazing application! I absolutely love this game! I'm completely addicted and play it on my sister's iPod as well as my kindle. I am unbelievably happy that I could finally get it on my kindle. Too bad I have to redo all the levels I have completed on my sister's iPod. :-(
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Like this book for the passion expressed about the Journey and food. Thank you Scott for sharing your journey thus far and Steve for balancing his words for those of us on our own journey. It is the Journey of Life not the goal that matters most.<br />Also has great recipes to add to my ever expanding Whole food life.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great novel by John Grisham<br />I hope to see a movie, with the author's input/approval.<br />I recommend this book to any thoughtful person
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant was a great way to tie up this amazing, well written series! I can't imagine this book ending in any other way. The writing of the different point of views was a little bit similar but not similar enough for me to be confused. I really enjoyed how she wrote it in Tobias`s point of view as well as Tris`s. I cried over the ending as well as the fact that the series was over!!:(((  i am SUPER excited for the movie Divergent to finally come out ( they picked the PERFECT CAST) and read this series over again oneday:))) i recommend these books for anyone looking for the BEST SERIES EVER!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was amazing. It was a fast-paced, action packed thriller. I recommend this to anyone over 12. I can't wait for the movie and I love how the series ends. (check out the other books in the series [speaker for the dead, xenocide, children of the mind, and ender in exile]).
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Overall, compared to all previous versions, Asphalt 8 is a massive breakthrough, with incredible graphics and detailed tracks (Easter eggs included)<br /><br />Now, on my Kindle Fire, I can only set the graphics to Medium - My friend uses an iPad Mini, and he can get the highest graphic levels, which are amazing, and include traffic; his GUI is also larger<br /><br />Suggested features:<br />Decals<br />More car colors
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a post 9/11 vet who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan with conventional forces but sometimes closely with SOF and Delta and SEAL teams, I was at first disappointed that this book would be written for many reasons. However, the author deals with those reasons very admirably and the book is a great red.
0385537816|5.0|I was so happy to receive the trilogy not only in the hardcover format but at such a fantastic price! The<br />attention they gave to packaging the books showed a lot of care and attention to detail.  It was much<br />appreciated!!  Thank you.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I bought the kindle version as soon as it came out and was so very excited. And then I read it.... Loved every moment until the end. And now I will never read this author again or watch the movies. Completely disappointing.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This Blu-ray is terrific.  The colors are vibrant and clear, the sound is excellent.  This is a classic science fiction film that set new standards for special effects.  You won't be disappointed in the quality.
B004EPYZOY|5.0|Nick Cage is great and there is plenty of action.  I've watched this movie several times and will most likely watch it again..
B004LROUNG|4.0|Pretty much what I expect from John Grisham.  Nice subject matter to take on.  While it slowed a little in the middle, it picked up nicely at the end.
1451666179|5.0|Anyone who has ever read or heard about Allie's blog should immediately buy this book.  The new material is fantastic, and reading the &#34;old&#34; material again was just as entertaining as it was the first time I read it.
B00G8YDVZS|5.0|I love the way this show just keeps reinventing itself over and over! This newest change adds even more suspense and conflict... What a fantastic show -- great writing, great cast -- THIS SEASON IS GOING TO BE THE BEST YET.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|I love this movie, I used to watch it all the time as a kid.  Steve Martin and Bill Murrary are fantastic in their roles. A classic.
B00FIYGYKS|5.0|Love this Album - as good as Waves.......... if you like Waves get it........... has a bit of their privious style too - death vocals.  Great solos.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Never blurry amazing game I just love it I recommend it as a good game if you love horses love it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game for all ages has many tasks to complete to make the game addicting and great for all ages
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Sissy says:  First of all, if I were rating the covers of the books in the Selection Series, straight 5′s baby. Fortunately, the stories are just as fabulous as the fashion. I like the premise of this series-- A dystopian former USA cum United States of China (because China really owns us, surprise!) cum Kingdom of Illea. We have returned to a monarchy and put in place a caste system to \\"protect\\" the citizens from their own ignorance.  Oh the roiling connivery!  Bubby says:  Yes, there is much intrigue and connivery (yes, we made up the word. Deal with it.) going on in the palace. Maxon is sneaking around and trying to defy his father, America is sneaking around with Aspen and there's lots more that I just can't tell you about. You'll have to read it for yourself.  Lots of fun to read.  See our full review at bubblebathbooks.net
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|Some creative music here from ol' boys.  Check  out Coup de Grace, Lost Women Blues, Queen of the Damned, Dust and Glass.
B009R89CRI|5.0|Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii lllllllllllllllooooooved it all and how it all ends and how they fight at first and then it all works out between rodrick and Greg
0812982622|5.0|I bought this because the author was coming to AWC (Arizona Western College) and I wanted him to sign it.  Unfortunately, I got ill and was unable to get the book signed, but what I have read so far is very good.  I am going to buy another book by the author as soon as I finish this one.
B009R89AA2|5.0|It was very cool and extraordinary funny It  was very interesting and I can't wait to read the rest  of the series I hope to read cabin fever
1449305172|5.0|It's an excellent how-to book that you should always keep over your desk! I hope there is more coming from Ash!!!
B009R89HY6|5.0|It was amazing and I can't wait to read Roderick rules let's just say it was amazingly funny and cool.
B00138H146|1.0|To me, this is one of the great live rock n roll albums of all time.  I have the album on vinyl and decided that I wanted to download it to my computer so that I could play it on digital media.  To my disappointment, this digital version is very poorly mixed.  As well as being known for Lou Reed's performance, the album features a great double lead guitar performance by Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter.  Unfortunately on this mp3 download, one of the guitar tracks is suppressed to where the sound is very unbalanced.  One guitar cuts  threw sharply in the foreground and the other one sounds as if it is somewhere in the next county.  This is really obvious on the Intro and Sweet Jane.  This is not the way it is supposed to sound.  I am sorry I wasted my money on this download.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great work out for a busy mom like me! I can do it at anytime & it really kicks my butt. I may never get past level 1;)
B005SCSL56|5.0|I love this book once i started i just could not put it down. I have started to read the second one hope it is as good as the first!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I do these puzzles every night, helps me relax to fall asleep. But sometimes I want to keep going because I love these puzzles. I only do the 15 x 15 size because the smaller ones end to quickly. My only wish for this app is that they will come out with even larger grids.<br />Anyhoo, this is probably the most user friendly logic art app I've found. And the prettiest. Most others are difficult to navigate and are just random, no pictures. So I highly recommend and I will probably be getting some of their other FlipPix Art apps too. To the developers: Thanks for being a puzzle lover and not just an app designer. It shows.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is great.  I love it.  It is really good and very accurate most of the time.  I would highly, highly recommend it.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|This is a really neat idea. It has a variety of different rocket parts to get each task done. And it's pretty involved. You won't be able to mindlessly pay this game. This might not be the app for people just looking to kill time. It takes thought and preparation to complete each task successfully, &amp; patience when the rocket just needs to do its thing for awhile. More for the people who like to think alot when playing a game, for those who like something close to realistic. I myself usually go for games that help me zone out. But that doesn't mean I should give this game any less stars. It is well thought out and fun, when ur in the mood to think. I suggest trying it, even if u aren't a &quot;thinker&quot;. It is well worth the price too. So many paid apps out there are sparse and unworthy of the asking price. With this one u get ur monies worth. I'm impressed with the makers of this app. Well done guys/gals!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for making this happen. Now I can play candy crush from my kindle. I'm so exited. Now  I hope other games come through.
B000SXJMRQ|5.0|Love this app u can get music at a very in expensive price considering that I lost all my music due to an email that had a virus
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought this to broadcast shows that we missed.  Don't have a DVR; cost was excessive so I subscribed to Hulu to see and broadcast the missed shows.<br />The problem is CBS shows, our most watched station, are not available through Hulu.<br />So initially, I was a little disappointed that I couldn't cast tv shows from the laptop to the tv.  I Googled it and found there is an add-on app that enables you to broadcast from a laptop.<br />This app isn't available for the tablet or smart phone.  The CBS app doesn't work with Chromcast.<br />It's almost just as easy to watch the show on the laptop.<br />I'm hoping Google will make an Android app available to solve this issue.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I'm not sure how much. I found myself getting bored at times. I enjoyed the fact that their relationship is getting stronger stronger and that they both are trying not to jump to conclusions. I really hope that the author doesn't try to drag this love story too far. I'm hoping the next book will be the conclusion of this love story. I will definitely be reading any other books she writes regarding Eva and Gideon.
1476729085|5.0|I read this book in just a few hours on the plane.  I loved it.  I don't have any autistic family or friends to compare this story too but I think I now have a better sense of what life would be like.  The story was very engaging and interesting.  I could see the end coming a mile away but I didn't mind, I still enjoyed it.
1932100660|5.0|This is an excellent book on the affects of nutrition on disease. Strong scientific evidence for the benefits of a whole foods plant based diet.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works well with youtube and netflix but not beyond that - which is as advertised. The only thing I am having difficulty with is accessing the unit from multiple computing devices. Based on instuctions it would appear that this is supposed to work but I have not been able to get it to work yet.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play a number of Bingo games on my Kindle and PC, this one is my favorite..lots of different power-ups and the slots are great when I run out of chips...I highly recommend!
B00C5R8364|4.0|I have always liked Forsyth's books and this is no exception. It is good escapism reading that is bolstered by its connection to current events. The plot detailing the hunt for an elusive Al Qaeda terrorist has enough factual information and elements of truth to make it believable. Likewise, the negotiation for the return of a hijacked ship and crew by Somali pirates has elements that were seen recently in the news. It is a bit of a stretch however to combine the two into a plot line when either could have stood on its own. Nevertheless, it is a good read for those who like the genre.
B00003CXTG|5.0|My parents love this movie. My dad was in WWII and the movie is nostalgic so I bought it for them.
B0002858YS|1.0|The Hot Fuss CD itself is amazing. However, the quality of this one was HORRIBLE. It was NOT in great condition. It wouldn't even play from all the scratche and marks on it. Save yourself the hassle and just buy the CD elsewhere.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Super game if you like unique puzzles. Great graphics and physics. The water looks real. My daughter has the kid version (Sprinkle Jr.) and loves it. Highly recommended for those of you out there that are sick of the same old types of games that keep coming out.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Anyone who loves history, especially the wild stories that end up being true, will love this movie. Make sure to check out the short doc on these events under the special features.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Although this movie was hard to watch at times, it depicted a very real reenactment of Jesus' last days....very powerful.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thought King told a good story here with Dr. SLEEP. It was nice to see how the little boy from The Shinning turns out.
B00EH0K9H8|5.0|I love this DVD, my only beef is i wish all cameras used were high def, I get the sense that only one or two of them are true HD. I get blu-rays expecting 1080P resolution full time. Look at Steve Wilson's last Blu-ray it is stunning. Still love the band, the the cover song choices and the crowd is even doing their part well. Don't get me wrong it;s not bad looking I am just and anal audiophile. I highly recommend this DVD.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Most interesting! It is definitely a good way to pass the time.  I think the creator/creators were very clever. And I completely appreciate that the app is free.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|Fun. Challenging. Progresdive. Like the diffrent wepons.  Best 99 cents I have spent when considering hours of play vs cost.  LOL !!!  Olmost regret the purchase because of time spent playing this game.  I don't even like zombie ,,,, anything.  But I guess I do enjoy planes and guns !!!
B000LXQVA4|4.0|My baby loved this toy. I got it when she was around 4 months and she is 8 months now and still uses it from time to time. She loves bouncing and all the attached toys (especially the dragonfly, she will chew on that all day!). This was a life saver some days when I needed a place to put the baby and keep her entertained while I prepared dinner, or went to the restroom etc. Now that my baby is standing and crawling, I don't use it as much. I put her in this while I shower if she's not napping, and keep it close to the bathroom door in our bedroom so I can see it from the shower. She still loves it, but is definitely starting to grow out of being entertained by it. I think she'll still be interested for another month or two and then she'll be done. A little pricey, but I think worth it, especially if you are buying it with the plans on using it for future children :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a super fun game and challenging as well!  Great time! I wish there were unlimited lives though.  Maybe that's a good thing. . .
B00FXEL00W|4.0|Super sweet.  I enjoyed how the author lets us get to know the two main characters.  I enjoy the Hollywood star kind of love.  I will revisit this book
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The only complaint is the loading time. Other than that i dont have any problems and love the interactive minions.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I HATE THIS BOOK I'VE READ THE WHOLE SERIES AND LOVE TRIS I LOVED THE BOOK BUT I HATE THE ENDING TRIS SHOULDN'T HAVE DIED
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I read this book a couple of years ago before I got my kindle and absolutely loved it.  So when i received my kindle, it was the first book i purchased.  Five stars isn't nearly enough when it comes to rating it. It deserves so much more then that!  I love everything about it and recommend it to anyone that loves to be transported into another time.  I'm going to read this again and again.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|I really enjoy this  game cause for one the gameplay is just...amazing<br />...what else?This game is just well done and has a good structure/idea to it.Well Done-5 Stars
B0024DF9MU|5.0|I love the movie.it was life like and situations are real.glad I could relate.the characters was brought to life really well.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of the greatest books I have ever read. It brought me to tears and I cannot say that about any other book. A must read for anyone who wishes to see beauty in literature.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|don't buy this. it was advertised as a device that will play whatever you're watching on your computer on your tv and it was a big lie. I worked for four hours trying to get it to display ANYTHING on the tv. Biggest waste of 40+ dollars. Don't make the same mistake I did.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|This show is extremely good at holding your attention, as there are episode ending story lines.  Plus some ongoing story lines that keep you wanting to see the next episode.  It does move slowly at time, but a good series.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|About seventy five percent of the book is plot introduction and character development; the rest trial.  Slow reading during that part, but a good lawyer yarn overall.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Amazingly written<br />The descriptions of people, places and stories are boundless.<br />The author reminds you of everything you already know to be true - but in a way that cements the ideas in your noggin.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|as I do everything English!<br /><br />They just do things better then Americans since they are not held back by religious zealots.
B004KKX80A|5.0|a  wonderful toy for kids and grown ups to  enjoy.  Product arrived fast and met expectations. Thank  you for great service and accurate product.
B00DTMCSO2|1.0|My 6 year old grandson was playing games on my kindle, I did not know that he bought this on my kindle,
B008Y212PI|5.0|A very good analytical puzzle game.  The artwork is also very interesting.  The longer grids can be a real challenge.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  I have always believed there is something beyond this life and what Dr. Alexander found there was not inconsistent with what I have been taught and believe awaits us when it comes our turn to pass through the veil.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Most shows by season 4, you'd grow tired of it.  There is something about the writing for this show that keeps you coming back for the next episode.  It's not an exact copy from the comic books, so please keep in mind it's a separate entity set in the same type of universe.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|The portal is so concise in covering news around the world extensively...I like the presentation like flipping the pages from bottom up.It's cool...
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Every kid should see this movie before the age of eight. It's one of those kids movies that even the parents can enjoy without getting bored. It gets five stars because this story is as awesome as it looks. It's a must see.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Loved the app in the beginning, but lately it freezes tremendously and locks my kindle fire display screen. Causing me to have to shut down my device completely, before using my kindle fire and my other apps.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Love the movie and this is a collector's edition limited to 35.000 it is a very interesting product to own.
B0089XH38M|1.0|On my Kindle,  this freezes whenever I do a scan.  On my Nexus 7,  it works fine.  Amazon issues maybe??  Who knows?
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game is super good besides wating for energy cores the robots are cool too.It is also cool how they have time attacks to get money.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|This was by far one of the better paced films I have seen in a while. It was fast and exciting, but at no point did you feel overwhelmed! The actors were remarkably cast! I refuse to give anything away, so I won't say too much!Michael Caine, Woody Harrelson and Morgan Freeman were wonderful, but it was Eisenberg and Ruffalo who stole the show. This movie was aptly &#34;Magic&#34;. I do not believe that you can watch this movie and be disappointed!  Enjoy!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was a fun follow up to the Shining. It was interesting to see the evolution of Dan Torrence. A good read all around.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|I love watching a show that is set in the 60's. The style and clothing are beautiful! I love seeing the cars and dacor!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|cute graphics, great song when you hit 800 points - funny 'ways to die&#34; - but there are no 'instructions' on how to do a few of the tests - like &#34;don't let him tip over&#34; and &#34;keep blowing&#34; for the airplane. Cute enough though
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is an AWESOME BOOK. I also download 2 and 3 Fifty Shades of Grey. I can not wait to read it. It was truly amazing.<br /><br />I have started the 2nd book and I can not put it down. And to tell you the truth I am not a book reader but several of my co workers at Publix ( which by the way is mentioned in book one) asked had I read it. I kept saying no until I got curious about all the buzz about this book. It caught my attention from start to finish, that is a first time for me.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a time waster. There are many difficult levels. Make sure you are hooked up with Facebook so your friends can help when you need it.
B00007E8O5|5.0|Have been a Jerry Cantrell fan for about 8 years now. Really enjoy his music. I especially like the bonus tracks.
B00F36ZHHC|1.0|I downloaded this app to my kindle fire hd and it never worked right. I hope you have better luck with this app then I had.
B0020TS5LU|5.0|I am a big fan of British films and history and this film fits the bill perfectly.  I only wish this film would be released on Blu Ray
B003G4W49C|5.0|I haven't read Ender's Game since high school.  On re-reading it as an adult, I found it just as page-turning and thought provoking as I did the first time.  The biggest thing that stood out to me were all the paradoxes.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes lies were more dependable than the truth.\\"<br /><br />- Orson Scott Card Ender's Game pg 2<br /><br />The biggest paradox was the contrast between the brothers Ender and Peter.  To completely defeat an enemy, do you need to understand and empathize with them so well that you know what will really hurt them?  To bring complete peace, do you need to be the kind of person that would think of all the ways to destroy peace in the first place?  I had never thought about the fact that even good characteristics can become evil simply based on how we use them.  Empathy can be used just as effectively to hurt others as to help them.<br /><br />\\"In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it's impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them--\\"<br /><br />\\"You beat them.\\" [...]<br /><br />\\"No, you don't understand. I destroy them.\\"<br /><br />-Orson Scott Card Ender's Game p. 238<br /><br />Ender's Game also had me pondering why we even fight wars in the first place.  On re-reading it, I empathized with the aliens that attack earth even more this time.  Is a lack of communication and understanding the only real reason for war?  Ender's simple, childlike way of viewing how pointless war is makes for a really good question because it's so simple.  Why CAN'T we leave each other alone?<br /><br />\\"I'm doing it again, thought Ender. I'm hurting people again, just to save myself. Why don't they leave me alone, so I don't have to hurt them?\\"<br /><br />- Orson Scott Card Ender's Game pg 115<br /><br />Ender is such a likable character.  This story wouldn't have worked without telling it from his point of view.  His actions paint him to be ruthless and uncaring.  But seeing his thoughts and dreams made me realize that he is a very caring and smart person who's biggest goal in life is to really just be left in peace and have friends.  And the fact that these dreams are so close but just out of reach kept me turning the page waiting waiting waiting for when (and really if) he would ever get them.<br /><br />As driven and smart as Ender is, you can still see his innocence because the way he views the world is not the way that adults do.  It was fascinating to read this first as a teen and now as an adult.  I saw the ending from Ender's point of view the first time and I was confused along with Ender.  This time I saw the ending from the perspective of the adults and was saddened that I could see what Ender couldn't.<br /><br />Overall, this was an unforgettable novel that every fan of science fiction should read.
B0079LJZG8|5.0|I'll start this off by saying that this is a Spy movie that isn't made for todays mainstream audience.  If James Bond or Jason Bourne with their uncanny physical ability, daredevil stunts, technical gadgetry, and ability to make love to the most beautiful women inside of 3 minutes while riding a horse backwards making thousand yard head shots is your idea of the quintessential spy, then I'm not sure you're ready to be humbled by George Smiley.  The greatest antithesis to the stereoptypical international man of mystery is a middle aged man whose greatest weapon is his noggin.<br /><br />Thomas Alfredson (Let The Right One In) has the latest pleasure of adapting a John Le Carre novel and takes on the heavily layered onion that is \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.\\"  The first thing you have to embrace is that this is a piece, while having quite a fantastic situation being resolved, is more akin to how real spy-work looks and takes place.  There really is an all-star cast here headed by Gary Oldman but also starring Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy, Mark Strong and a few more familiar faces and they deliver.  I thought this piece had an awesome feel to the era, it was like a time machine, and that gave it great authenticity.  Like in true espionage what is required in order to appreciate this film is patience and a willingness to be able to follow the characters, who they are, and what they are up to.  If you appreciate a cerebral mystery/thriller and can keep the ADHD at bay you might just enjoy one of the best Spy movies ever. YES ever...  I've seen this movie a half-dozen times or so, that's really how much I enjoy the film.<br /><br />The movie takes place in 70's England and we are following the British Intelligence Bureau and their Counter-Intelligence division codenamed \\"The Circus.\\"  George Smiley (Gary Oldman) begins the movie as \\"Control's\\" (Codename of the head of CI) right hand man and we quickly see him and \\"Control\\" fired from the Circus bc of recent deficiencies they've had in the field.  This leaves Bill Haydon (Colin Firth) Percy Alleline (New head of CI) Roy Bland, and Toby Estehasse heading up \\"The Circus.\\"  Smiley is like a fish out of water in retirement, especially considering the love of his life, his wife, keeps more things on the sidelines than Alabama Football and Control has recently passed away.  This is where your patience is required in the early stages, then an agent, Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy) returns home under suspicious circumstances and contacts a parliament member who oversees intellligence and makes a wild claim.  Smiley is then contacted by the Member and after a meeting in which he is told that there is a dreaded KGB mole in the counter intelligence unit, the Member admits that Control had brought this to his attention before but that he thought he had gone mad. The game is now a foot and George Smiley begins his operation with the help of one outside retired police officer and Peter Guillim (Cumberbatch), long time friend and Tarr's boss.  After Smiley visits an analyst forced out for asking the wrong questions and Controls apartment and see's that Control had 5 candidates for the mole he meets Tarr to gauge the veracity of his story and his claims. Realizing that Karla's (KGB Chief Codename) mole is a high level member of counter intelligence, he sends Guillim into the Circus to spy for him and we are greeted with some tension provided by Cumberbatch.  By this time Smiley is in full gear and emotions are running high, not for Smiley who is always even Steven, and as Smiley knocks down domino after domino he gets the piece that he needs in tracking down the agent (Mark Strong) who returned home from the op that was blown the previous year that was justification for his letting go.  Smiley sets the bait at the end of the movie to see which rat will crawl onto the trap and hopefully resurrect his career and good name.<br /><br />This movie has close to zero action in it and is a thinkingman's movie, that being said it is based on an extremely famous work by author John Le Carre who was himself a spy for British Intelligence.  I thought that Alfredson and the cast did a bang up job on this whole gig and thank them for bringing this book to modern day cinema.  This movie is smart without being pretentious and it's serious without being over-dramatic. Alfedson is all business in his duties directing the characters and that is the way it should be in this movie.  In a world full of Jason Bournes and James Bonds a dash of George Smiley is a long time coming and I hope not too far off in the near future.  Considering this was part of a trilogy before it was cool to do trilogies it would be nice to see Oldman resurrect his role along with Cumberbatch.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|It was a simple story had action  and a lot of fun to watch I would recommend it to everyone
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S3 charger with this cable, and bought my brother one as well when his went out.  Really nice.  They actually seem to fit better than the Samsung cables.  Go figure.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I like political drama's and I think the cast does a good job.  It is very easy to get involved with the characters.
B009BJAPLK|3.0|This started out fairly boring and I decided to watch more. Although it can be dry at times I like a good mystery. This is good and I hope it will get better.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I loved this movie. Best big monster movie since Godzilla crawled out of the depths over half a century ago and trashed Tokyo . Pacific Rim delivers the best action of any movie of 2013. From the director to the actors, everyone did a great job. If you loved the old Godzilla movies you'll appreciate Pacific RIM for good solid entertainment.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book! I recommend it to people who love action and drama books. Also, people who like a lot of suspense. I rate this book a 5 out of 5 because it always had my attention and I wanted to read it all the time. Although, there is violence, and blood, and a bit of scary parts, it is an amazing book
B00005K3NR|5.0|Two weeks ago I went to see the new version.  I thought the movie was an okay remake.  Last night I sat down and watched the 76 version.  I have to say the 76 version is so much better in many ways.  The acting is terrific.  I love Juliana Moore,  but her interpretation of Mrs. White can't hold a candle to that of Piper Laurie.  I felt the direction and the whole production in the original was incredible! By the way, Sissy Spacek is awesome!!!!
B004UID2LC|5.0|For the price of free, this app is hard to beat. It is super simple to download a video. When you are in Youtube, you simply have to click the share button and choose &#34;Youtube Downloader&#34; This is extremely helpful when streaming a Youtube video is slow and it is such a long video.<br /><br />It's a shame that the Play Store doesn't have this. But that's where Amazon App store really becomes handy!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I am very glad that I invested in an Amazon Prime.  Besides the shipping benefit, subscribers can stream for free episodes of certain TV programs.  Suits is one of these programs.  It was only recently when I took an interest in the series and it was such a pleasure knowing that I could easily and quickly view all of the episodes from season 1 for free.  I encountered absolutely no technical issues.  I would make a request, Amazon would set up the video stream, and I would sit back and watch the episode without a glitch.  Thank you Amazon for this wonderful benefit of membership.  Take advantage of this service.  It is so easy.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was horrible. I wish I hadn't wasted my time reading it. Quite a few of the plot points made no sense at all which is frustrating to read especially when the other plot points seemed to be redundant. There's no need to talk about it further because obviously everyone else doing reviews has gone over all of the ridiculousness that is Allegiant. Luckily, I am the fastest reader in my group of friends and was able to warn everyone else off from this book so as not to waste their time. I also will not be attending the Divergent movie which I had been excited about because obviously I don't want to invest any more time in this series. Every so often I hit upon a book that I just absolutely hate and this happens to be one of them.
B006X5L6VS|3.0|I purchased this game before I found out that the Kindle Fire HD does not have GPS, so it does not work when you try to find out what the stars are above.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I love Michael Buble but am blown away by&#34; Call Me Irresponsible&#34;.  Many hits are variations of Sinatra &#34;saloon songs&#34;.  Very slight changes in timing and dropping of words for the fab mmmm that he does.  Had never heard &#34; I'm Your Man&#34; before, very sexy, cautionary tale.<br />  Great to listen too and great as background music. Ta da,Michael...  Call me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It kept me spell bound and I would watch 2-4 episodes at a time. very good would recommend it to anyone.
1250038820|5.0|I spent 2 hours browsing the pages of this book before my husband suggested I set it down to save some for another day.  Love the photos and the personal stories Brandon has been sharing on Facebook for a long time now.  I'm so excited I could affirm his work by purchasing a book.  I wish him all the success in the world.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|cool little game. wish it was easier to earn gold. controls are good. simple concept. just more gold. hahaha bottom
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I have to say although I do understand some of the negativity to peoples reviews, I dont get why so many hated this book.  My over all view was that it was definitely not as strong of a book as the first two but not horrible either.  I liked the dual pov the book had, however I do agree with others that Tobias at times was too much like Tris and therefore it was hard to decipher between the two characters.  I felt both characters were very complex and well developed.  There was a repetition to this book in comparison to the other books, however I think the was actually the idea.  Allegiant drives home the idea of the importance tolerance and equality.  The beginning of the book was a little slow but it does pick up.  I would of liked more dialogue and interaction between Tris and Tobias.  Especially when there was conflict between them. It seems like the biggest problem people had with this book was the ending.  Without giving anything away, I will say that even though I would of maybe preferred a different ending, it wasnt a bad ending.  It was unexpected and real.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|we basically plugged and played. it took a bit to figure out how to cast from our hard drives, but the casting from the internet was no problem. we finally got it all set up to cast from our hard drive and now really enjoy that aspect of it.
B0026P40NU|5.0|I Loved this!  I have no idea where I even found out about this program but I borrowed it on DVD from my local library and I'm so glad I did.  It was just great fun.  I loved all the characters, loved the costumes, loved the period... I just loved the whole thing.  It was sad, funny, sexy and serious.  I really wanted it to go on and on, six episodes was not enough.<br /><br />If you like to read historical fiction and generally can't find anything good to watch on TV I recommend trying this.  Though be warned it is rather racy with a fair amount of nudity.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|this was a book club pick and i read it cover to cover. it was a really good story and very riveting. being from the south, it was a great look into the historical context of this story.
B00ARN0XGG|2.0|The movie didn't really explain much. I expected the movie to explain why the kids were being haunted Toby. So I thought they would go back even further and tell the mother/grandmother's side. Had its moments, but was expecting something different.
B00G32OER4|4.0|It was a alright movie, nothing great as it was predictable what was going to happen, might have been better in the movie house.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Beautiful insight into the Muslim culture, Pakistan and beyond. A true hero with an inspirational story just beginning to be told.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|It kept you wondering what was going to happen next, really enjoyed it. One of Mathew McConaughey,s better movie in my opinion.
B00CQZ6EFW|4.0|Bill Bryson manages to capture the spirit of the 1920s by paying attention to the summer of 1927.  Calvin Coolidge, Charles Lindbergh, Al Capone and Babe Ruth are some of the leading characters that he profiles.  He's supplies a lot of background information about these people - and others, too - that was not previously well known.  As a result one comes away with a better appreciation of some of the major events that happened in 1927. Best of all is Bryson's &#34;laid back&#34;, almost sarcastic at times,  comments about the behavior of people in 1927 and as interpreted in 2013.  Best of all, is that he follows up with many that he has profiled in the summer of 1927 and their destinies post1927.
B00932A4N4|5.0|This is a great love story! I will watch this one over and over. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes love stories.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Difficult to beat a good robot fight. The special effects were good as well. Worth the view time to see.
8590379825|5.0|I love Lua and the book was excellent. I've had it for over 2 years.  Even though all of the book is free online, I wanted to support Roberto the creator of Lua. Really nice guy and awesome language, this is a must buy!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Fair price and works great!  Glad we bought it.  I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to wirelessly send media from their ipad or ipod to their television.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|$30 is a ton of money to spend on a connector, but it's excellent that I can use my thunderbolt ports for something.  I don't have any USB ports open which is why I was forced to buy this connector. If you have open USB ports, just buy a cheap ethernet to USB connector for $2
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I liked the twist never guessed what was coming! Kept me on edge .like know she fills you in on the background of the towns
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Stephen King has always been my favorite author so I don't like criticizing his imagination. Something seemed to be missing in this novel that I have found in his other works. I believe that it might be his method of introducing the characters and assigning them their personalities. He creates more sub plots than he has done in the past so for me its a bit harder to follow the main story. I'm in my seventies now and not as quick as I use to be, that's probably why reading has become more challenging. It's still a great read and i'm waiting for his next work. SK thank you for many enjoyable hours of your bizarre and fascinating tales. Jer
B00FI7XBIS|1.0|It was like angry birds but worse in my opinion. Not a very fun game at all in my opinion.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The best game ever, but also the most addictive. Just wish we didn't have to pay for extra lives or special power ups.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was reserved in purchasing because some said it was predictable - I disagree.  I did not see the twists and turns coming and was on the edge of my seat numerous times.  I had to keep reading (even though I hadn't planned to) because I needed to find out what was going to happen next.  I definitely recommend.
0545265355|5.0|I wish there were more books yet to come. This series completely drew me in. I read the entire series front to back in a week. I couldn't put them down! Read the books, then enjoy the movies.
B00CBT04LI|4.0|I am a big fan of the Carpenters' the thing... Probably one of the best horror movie ever!<br /><br />I bought this one (the prequel to Carpenter version of the thing from outer space) mainly to complete my order to get free shipping.  The movie is alright far less good that the Carpenter's original and of course the computerized Fx don't look as good as the old school FX puppet stuff and the like.<br /><br />i did notice some scene not being in line with the Carpenter movie but this needs to be verified by watching both movies back to back... Halloween is coming!
B0095G5AFU|3.0|The app itself isn't bad and does not malfunction or anything like that, but I just had a peculiar application I was trying to find a tool for (using my Kindle Fire as a &#34;fakebook&#34; reader for gigs as a musician) and this app didn't allow me to sort or alphabetize each individual page in my notebooks.  Otherwise ok - would probably work well for someone else using it another way.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|Nothing wrong but the movie is far from being great... I should have watched it through rental before buying.<br /><br />The 3D does not bring any special on the movie.  No well used!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great challenge but can get very frustrating! See if you can play without resorting to buy cheaters! Good for all ages
B00632HWOG|4.0|I used yahoo mail on my Samsung Galaxy 3 and on my Kindle Fire HD and find it extremely useful!  Every now and then it has a quirk, but for the most part, it's a great app.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|The world of Camorr, the shark-infested lagoon city built upon the near-indestructible relics of elderglass masonry, is a jewel of well crafted contrasts. Light and dark, rich and poor, thieves and aristocracy, sorcery and alchemy, mischief and grief. Overall, a very solid foundation for a universe in which to tell many more entertaining stories, with a wide palette of characters and settings to choose from.<br /><br />The plot is intricate, unfolds at a steady pace, and resolves with satisfying clarity in the end. The near-invincible, very powerful and generally insufferable villains also make for an interesting puzzle - how on earth will our hero prevail against such seemingly insurmountable odds?
B009EE1GC4|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and bought it because I enjoyed it so much.  I just watched it again with my youngest daughter (29).  It's a great story with lots of great real-life type experiences.  Good actors/actresses and great story line.
B004P4KMSC|3.0|We love Bruder toys!  This one is great too... I just wouldn't have ordered it if I knew it would not come in the color that was depicted (red).  We got a white one and the toy being white looks a bit cheap...  Sending it back in hopes for a red one next time...
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This is a great app for my little pony fans. It keeps me in touch with my little pony while no new episodes have come out yet. This is a great app that I think you will love if you don't already have this app. I find no problems at all with it.
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|dixon brothers in the same box - perfect !<br /><br />such a classic and its brand new ! so glad i bought it for my collection
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have candy crush saga on my computer, my phone and now my kindle.  I am addicted to candy crush saga!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This was much anticipated by myself due to the hype showcased in its pre-release promotional materials. This movie grabs you at the beginning with the comeuppance of &#34;Captain&#34; Kirk + follows thru with his rising from the ashes of self denial to the brave + smart Leader that is his character's trademark to save the day !
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|Never been so annoyed at wasting 99 cents, let alone the time I wasted reading this book. The writing style is stilted, false and makes the presents the characters as unrealistic. Can't believe this is the start of a series, what publisher in their right mind puts out this one, let a lone all the sequels.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this show!  Wish I had started watching sooner.  It has smart witty humor and drama all in one. A must watch!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Enjoy the game. Can be addictive if I could play all the time.  Very fast paced game to play when plsying.
B005FFW46S|1.0|Strange to say the least. I have been reading Terry for most of my life and this one was even stranger that the others. Whatever he was on at the time he wrote this one----NO--do not share. I only read a few chapters- BRB - was gonna look at it again but I DELETED IT FROM MY KINDLE. Strange, very very strange.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent very much. Thankfully, Allegiant continued right where the last book left off. It was beautifully written and moving. The book was also thought provoking.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over. Wait, i DO watch this movie over and over! If only that dumb dog hadn't been in their way!!:)
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I really enjoy the episodes of Dr. Who. I am a new fan of the show. Great job to the producers and actors
055338466X|5.0|Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow take explaining quantum physics to heart. It's a simple, but very interesting read that changed my perspective on the universe, and even life. This, together with the Discovery Channel series of the Grand Design and Into the Universe has opened my mind and taught me many amazing lessons that not only happen in the universe, but of course reflect on our daily lives.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Addicting show...can't get enough of it.  I can't wait until the next season begins this January.  Love the historical aspect.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|My six year old daughter liked this but we thought it was really silly and not that great.  The best part of the movie was the beginning in the race for food.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|continued great story line, wonderful period costumes, and of course engaging acting.<br />I hope the series never ends........<br />Watch it
B000SC245E|5.0|My copier works like new now.  I am quite happy with this purchase.  It was also very easy to install.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Powerful, honest discussion engaging men and women alike to confront the biases many of us ignore, and harness the power of all of us to end this discrimination we tend to ignore.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Enjoy playing Mahjong.  Very colorful and a great diversion. Keeps getting more difficult as you go. Love it!  Look forward to playing this game a lot.
B0089LOG02|5.0|If your family history includes adoption of \\"the great\\" generation this book will hit home.  The author writes a story with lots of truth and understanding of human nature and the will to live and persevere inspite of the circumstances. I could not put it down and want to read more about orphan trains and more books by Christina Baker Kline.
1451666179|5.0|Not only is this fantastic content, but the print quality is among the best I've seen. Color pages with a coating to insure handling won't wear them out. Color me super impressed. Go Allie!
B003WMA7BU|5.0|This perfect noir crime book is one of the best I've read in recent memory. It when directions that were completely unexpected. Deserves a 5/5.
B004PGO25O|4.0|I'll be read in it again. Predefined gives you a lot to think about in a little book. Worth the time
B00F35B8F8|5.0|No one will be disappointed! It's exciting, heart-breaking, and fun all wrapped into one fantastic story with a wonderful &#34;new&#34; cast to carry on into brave new worlds! Even better than the last!
B00D3LA5WG|2.0|I bought this movie thinking since it had Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon that it HAD to be good. However, the entire movie is slow. There are no &#34;action&#34; seens. Matthew & Reese are never really &#34;together&#34;. It was just a dud. I was highly disappointed. The description of the movie is highly misleading.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|When you need a nice all performance handy tool this is the one, I would recommend this Gerber tool to any one that needs a handy tool.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|What a fun and challenging game. I love p laying it for hours. I grips your attention a d keeps.<br />Some of the levels are pretty hard but it's fun once you are successful to make it<br /> to the next level. I love playing it
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Got to be one of the best for entertainment and really what's going on. Really good for news also, when the news report stop, go to YouTube to see the real story!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Fun game. Will keep you busy for hours but can be pretty challenging at times. Levels are fun to try to achieve.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Weather on the fly. What could be better? Easy to use, radar accurate, you can check the weather where you are going on your travels and make plans accordingly.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|One of the best series of books I've read. This follows along very nicely with her other two series. Very well done.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|The little mermaid is my daughters favorite. we all love watching this movie. she sings the mermaid songs all of the time.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|can hardlly wait til this is a movie  real page turner with lovable characters and some not so lovable.  so grab a cup of joe get a fire started and settle in for a great read
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game for everyone. It is a game that makes you think long and hard before you make a move.
B001IWUZYK|5.0|The best Oliver Twist film! I am not big on musicals, but I love this movie. The acting was superb. And the musical score made it even more enjoyable. My recommendation, buy the original and not the CD/DVD combo pack.
B0098460O4|4.0|The music was good, but the cd was damaged inside the cover. It has a crack as from the middle. :(
B00571F26Y|4.0|Finally, a diet book that is not a diet book. Wheat Belly does just come up with random jargon and excuses for why people are not loosing weight and feeling healthy, it offers real medical studies. Some of the text can be a bit dry, but I like to be informed and I would prefer dry over a bunch of words that mean nothing. This book has confirmed my choice to go wheat free.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's ok to me. I kind of wish that it had more of a story mode than it does. But that's ok. I like it just the same.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Awesome movie. Delightfully funny! It had to be with the cast this movie featured. Full of action from beginning to end.
B00EQF2EIG|1.0|I couldn't hear or follow the dialog in this movie. There were no subtitles that I could find and so I didn't watch more than the first few minutes of the movie. Disappointing.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is like totally awesome love it wouldn't play another like it. I definitely would recommend this game to my friends..
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Exceeded my expectations.  Easy to set up.<br />Works excellently in the iPad's back ground.<br />Did not impact the iPad's speed or functionality.
0545265355|5.0|It is, truly, one of the best trilogy after Harry Potter. As a Potter fan I can now considered my self as a Tribute. It is amazing and it kept you reading for the moment of the end. I read them like in 5 days because I couldn't stop, because I needed to know what was happening on the next chapter.. IDK, it's awesome and it's very well written. Thanks Suzanne for these amazing books
B00BAXFAOW|2.0|Despite some misgivings, I liked Gladwell's previous books (Tipping Point, Outliers, Blink).  This time the same misgivings seemed much more prominent:  Giving some examples which support your theory does not validate a theory!  For example, saying (as Gladwell does) that losing your parents at a young age, or otherwise having a horrible childhood, makes you fearless and likely to achieve great heights (e.g. become prime minister of the UK, find a cure of childhood leukemia), and giving examples of such people, does not prove the point until you show what the preponderence of people with such experiences end up doing.  The majority may prove to be mentally ill, or in prison, or otherwise unsuccessful or unhappy.  The writing in this book seemed sloppy, heavily padded with unrelated information, and very annoying by using the same turn of phrase (You wouldn't want your child to be dyslexic.  Or would you?) over and over, in a rather condescending tone.
B008MVPF72|5.0|These are my first pair of Crocs. They feel very comfortable. I shall have to see how they hold up. My previous clogs were the cheap Chinese knockoffs.
B00BAXFDLM|3.0|I read the reviews and purchased this with some eagerness. I suppose I was expecting something...more? The plot was relatively engaging. The characters were...adequate. Even now, just a week afer finishing it, I only remember vague impressions of the plot, and the characters are somewhat indistinct. The specific plot points are a haze.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm spoiled by the late Iain M. Banks, who created ships that were actual *characters*. Perhaps I bought this looking for a Banks novel, really. You know, the kind of colorful story that never leaves you? The kind that stays with you for a long time after you put it down, and makes you want to read it again, and savor parts again? And you say to yourself, \\"I could never in a million years have come up with this.\\"<br /><br />This wasn't one of those.
B004TBWFAO|4.0|I don't usually like modernism, but I liked To The Lighthouse.  It is written almost entirely using the personal thoughts of the several characters.  This sounds like a gimmick, but Woolf depicts the internal monologue with such clarity and wit that it is actually a kind of realism.  For example, Mr. Ramsay walks about the grounds while metaphorically surveying the avenues of his philosophy, with the extent of human knowledge right at the end of his terrace.  It's beautiful to read, but it takes a lot of energy.
B00ABLJ5NQ|2.0|I fail to see how this book made it to the New York Times best seller list. It was tempting to stop reading this novel part way through but I persevered to the end wondering why I had wasted my time. Extremely disappointing to say the least.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|love the show and want Elena and Damon to stay together. Also want Bonnie back. Also surprised that none of the Originals make an appearance.
B00EWPW4EY|5.0|There are some really good songs on this cd.  Definitely worth the money if you like this style of rock....
0810993139|5.0|My son was never into reading until he started reading this series. Now he's read all of them and was very happy with the books.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Highly recommend. If you like Divergent, Hunger Games, etc, you will love this. Every night I have stayed up later than I intended bc I couldn't put this book down.
B00G32OMF8|1.0|This movie sucks! I was very disappointed the conversation and no plot was a total bore. Save your money folks.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I am addicted to this show!  I love that Amazon Prime allowed me to go back and view the seasons I missed.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|In short, Janell Monae is amazing and this album showcases her wide range. It builds on the android theme and her growing popularity attracted a number of wonderful contributors. This is one of the best albums in many years but an energetic young star with a powerful vocal gift.
B00F30S0Y0|2.0|I'm not entirely sure why Arcade Fire keeps getting so much praise from reviewers everywhere but the fact of the matter is that their music is not actually any good, especially in this album. Most of the songs are just random melodies with lyrics and you'll be hard-pressed to find more than three tunes of any worth: Reflektor, It's Never Over and Afterlife being the only ones which really deserved some attention. I listened to the whole album in my car with an excellent setup and was extremely surprised at how bad it was to the point that I felt it deserved another listen to be fair: after all, so many reviewers can't possibly be wrong. On a second listen, I despised the content so much that I needed to filter out any memory of the album by listening to something better which will remain nameless. Are reviewers simply giving Arcade Fire's content good reviews because they would feel stupid for not 'understanding' the music or do they really believe that their stuff is actually good? I used to believe that they actually thought it was good but the fact that some claimed that this was the BEST album made them lose all credibility in my eyes.
B002ZFQD0E|4.0|This is JM's second widespread release it it (obviously) follows her android vision. This is a more mature album and has great mass appeal than her intro. She started to attract contributors and production help, and it shows in the majesty and sweep of this album. Her incredible voice has such a range that she can hop from one genre to another in the album and pull it off, and still weave together the story of her android persona. Wonderful stuff.
0394800184|5.0|Cute book! Baby loves it and mom is happy to finally have one of her favorite children's books to read at night.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Seriously, maybe the best book ever written. OK, Perhaps that's an exaggeration, but such FABULOUS stuff! YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK. If you don't, it is possible that you are dead.... or should be.....
0449011909|5.0|This review counts towards not only this, but to all of the Fire and Ice audiobooks.  Of course we all know that the books are some of the greatest high fantasy of our generation and they are written in a way that makes them accessible to all readers, not just fantasy nuts like me.  It is the performance Mr. Dotrice gives that makes this a special buy.  Roy Dotrice's ability to manage characters and accents throughout the body of his work is phenomenal.  All of the Lannisters talk with the same accent...as do all of the wildlings, the Starks, etc.  I drive all day long for my job and I have listened to nothing other than these audiobooks for months now.  I get excited when a new one comes in the mail - and I am a 37 year old father of 2 that is normally impervious to excitement.  These audiobooks have given me something to look forward to and I am really dreading the day when I run out of them!
B00G32TD98|4.0|A genuinely enjoyable experience. Excellently paced.  Even my wife liked it (and she hates horror movies). Overall a good Halloween flick (or any night you are looking for a non-gimmicky fright)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Yes! So relatable. Abra and Dan have powers but still the characters are believable . One of Stephen King's books that I will read again and listen to.
B00E8JZILA|5.0|This game made me cry.  Seriously.  This is one of the few games in the last several years that has made me feel a true emotional attachment to the characters (ala Heavy Rain, Last of Us).<br /><br />This port of all the chapters of Tell Tale Game's (creators of Monkey Island, Back to the Future) Walking Dead interpretation was thoroughly enjoyable and the story, which adapts to the choices you make, will pull at your heart strings.  Incredible.  Buy it now
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|but we have reached level 35 and now in order to keep playing the game expects you to purchase more levels or ask friends on facebook, i do not do facebook !
B009FZFONO|5.0|It's the walking dead... What more needs to be said.  A great apocalyptic &#34;what if&#34; mixed with zombies.  Pass the pop-corn!
006202406X|3.0|Well, I was so excited when this book came out - and I was honestly very disappointed.  Not only in the ending, which crushed me, but in reading the book it just never gripped me.  There were a lot of references to things, people, etc. that were never fully disclosed. For example The Fringe - you get to visit the Fringe a couple of times, but you still don't know how the Fringe came about, and what happens to them later.  It's just kind of there, but not...if that makes sense.  Then, I hated the chapters flipping between Tris and Tobias - it just didn't flow very well.  Some of the characters I don't feel we knew quite enough about - I would have like to understand David a little more...understand his true motivations and why he was so evil and intent on creating a world with nothing but GP's.  Same with Nita - she's in the story for such a short time, in a big way, then you see her briefly again at the end - there could have been some better character development there as well.  I could really go on about a lot of disappointments in the book - it was not nearly as good as the first 2 in the series.  However, it wasn't awful - I'm glad I read it, and if you made it through the first 2, I recommend reading it if nothing else for closure (somewhat) of the story.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Great music and interesting character arcs, I have enjoyed watching this show and somehow I always seem to shed a tear.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|I enjoy the robots and the monsters the movie was ok ... My son enjoyed a lot ... Good effects
B0035HKWLW|5.0|Not the first time I seen this one, but I like to see all or parts of it again and again.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is awesome but eventually I get bored cause I have every jet pack I hope this game gets an update soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|Just finished book, had to see movie.  Really good.  Actor did a great job and just about looked like him.
B00E6X4GAW|4.0|I have only put this book down once since starting to read it!!!!an amazing eye opener that in this current day and age so many people are still deprived of basic human necessities. I salute this young girl and her family for sharing their struggle and pain with us.In sharing their story with us they have also educated us of the importance of education in society, to everyone, be it girl or boy ,young or old.This is an amazing story and a must read!!!!
B004LWZW2E|1.0|The acting is fine, and the story starts off well enough. There are a few instances early on when I had true jump-in-my-seat moments. About midway through the film, things go deeply south. It becomes very predictable. Then there's a scene that involves a parapsychologist... she puts on a mask resembling a gas mask, and attaches it to one of her associates to communicate with him (while he's sitting right next to her)... It is laughably bad, and undoes any tension that had previously been built. The ending is completely predictable and not all all scary. My husband go this for 99 cents and we feel he paid too much.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A story of death & dying told in an honest and direct way without being maudlin.  A fast and touching read!
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|My kids loved this CD they are fans and listen all the time. happy with the purchase perfect birthday gift
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I have read everything Stephen King has written, I have been fan for 30 years and this is his WORST BOOK EVER!

B00DCX08MW|1.0|This one was removed shortly after installation. Don't waste your time. The play is boring and sluggish. Hated it. try another.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Very simply, a very revealing video that I seem to be enjoying every time I play it.  If you are an Eagles fan it's a must for your library.  That should be enough of a review.
B002JXICCY|5.0|This is what a rockumentary should be! Enough talking, enough music, and enough of the creative essence of the band to make it a great watch.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|I've bought this book after adopting my first dog, and I wanted to be better informed about how to approach her.<br /><br />McConnell clearly explains the differences between human psychology and dog psychology, linking to relevant research through the book, reinforces them with personal stories and gives good examples of why thinks we like doing around the dogs aren't always the best for the dogs.<br /><br />One example that clearly stuck with me is the tendency of humans to pet a dog on the head, and how she used this to her advantage by training her dogs that pat on the head means &#34;go away&#34;. Dogs like petting, not patting, and it's always fascinating to see the understanding on people's faces when I put them in the dog's paws by asking: &#34;How would you feel if a twenty foot giant pat you on the top of your head and you didn't have arms to stop him?&#34;<br /><br />After reading this book my dog and I had gotten considerably closer. I've gotten better at controlling her during our walks, reading her body language, and constantly applying the knowledge I gained from the book at the dog park reading other owners and not getting into what's potentially bad situations between my dog and other dogs.<br /><br />It is a must read for all dog owners.
B00G32TD98|4.0|Enjoyable movie with a story and a back story. Well developed if not rushed a little bit. Kept me watching and even sparked discussion the next day. worth the time.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Great concept and strong character performances, but definitely the weakest of all the Star Trek series. It may have been Porthos' fault.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|TripAdvisor is one of the first and best travel resources since Al Gore created the internet. This is a must have for anyone from day trips to vacations, to just finding a restaurant.
B005TBN3EU|5.0|After a particularly &#34;trying&#34; week needed something totally &#34;off the wall&#34;...this was it.  We laughed till tears flowed.  It's a ridiculous movie and that's what we were after.  Would I watch it again...probably.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Pretty good, some lag in the video itself but better then it use to be! I'm glad I can stream through the Wii!
B009D3CTVS|5.0|Was unable to load patches to my vintage DX-7 due to Microsofts crappy MIDI driver.  Got this unit and the supplied software, loaded it in no time flat, and all my problems went away.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Action packed and full of surprises.  Cant't wait for another, hopefully in the works?  Great acting and love the interplay between the characters
B00BZBPRBA|5.0|This is my daughters favorite movie. She has seen it at least a hundred times and still can't get enough!
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|I thought it was just as good if not better than the first one.  Steig Larsson was a master storyteller.
B00B97SNJI|3.0|I first saw Dawes on TV & noticed how the two brothers complimented each other.  One is &#34;Great &#34; guitarist, the other, a great drummer.  They sing well together.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The ending of the book was very unexpected. It moved me in a way that I rarely feel after finishing a good story.
B00F35BV64|3.0|I love Sci-Fi so I would watch this anyway, but I don't consider these last Star Trek moves to be &#34;true&#34; Star trek.  The J. J. Abrams production team even admits they did not get the Star Trek philosophy and it shows.  This one has a few inconsistencies with the Star Trek Universe story line.  To me it seems like they are &#34;chasing the Hollywood shiny thing&#34; trying to get a block buster, and it just so happens to look like Star Trek, as opposed to a true Star Trek production.  There is another Roku title that expresses this sentiment called &#34;Trek Nation&#34; which by Rod Roddenberry (Gene Roddenburry's son).  Rod Roddenberry states that most of his life he did not &#34;get&#34; what Star Trek was all about and this documentary was about his quest to find out.  Like some other producers that do great original stuff but flub a remake (e.g. Tim Burton), Abrams does better with his own stuff like Fringe.  I cringe when these producers try to tackle someone else's production (especially when it's a classic) like Tim Burton did with Planet of the Apes and J. J. Abrams did with Star Trek.<br /><br />Believability is another aspect of capturing your audience: One thing I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT STAND ABOUT HOLLYWOOD is when there is a spectacular and highly unbelievable sequence like Spock in the volcano.  I don't care what kind of technology they have, surviving that fall and the heat of the volcano was just not believable to the point of being dumb, loosing my interest and faith in the process.  Star Wars did this as well when they had the light saber fight above the volcano lava... and not a singed hair?  No breathing problems?  Nothing???  I think you can put together a spectacular scene and have it believable and that the believability is a plus. Incorporating the real life physics would even make it more interesting and dramatic but instead Hollywood always takes the cheap shot and chases the shiny thing, missing the opportunity's to create noteworthy classics.<br /><br />Hollywood... here's $12... go out any buy yourself some integrity!
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Great movie even with subtitles. It's a long one but I didn't lose interest. It was interesting to see this story from the German perspective.
B009LDD54K|4.0|I bought this for my husband and he thoroughly enjoyed it, he has watched it over and over again and can't wait for season four
B00E0SX118|5.0|We loved this movie.  It was one of the first movies that my 2 year old saw in the theater, and she sat through the whole thing.  We laughed a lot and never got bored.  Some parts could be a little scary for small kids but I would definitely recommend this as one to watch with the kids.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It's not my usual type of book to read but from the time I started to read it until I finished it I just couldn't stand to stop and go on with other things.  It was hard to put down.  The story never lets you down, it peaks your interest from one page to another, the characters are believable and there are twists ands turns you don't see coming.  I would read it again and recommend it to me gal pals. Great read!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|We all make choices, good and bad. We all reap the consequences, good and bad. But sometimes we duck and dodge a lot but the consequences always catch up to us - good and bad! Would love to see the movie.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Simply put, I really loved it. Once I started I could not put it down...and when it was over I wanted more. Worth every minute.
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|this cd was excellent just like all o their cds are, had no issues in purchasing this item, its a good product and i would highly recommend
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Great music, great quality. fantastic DVD! Looking forward for next cd's and dvd's! The Piano Guys do great job!!! Your fan in Latvia
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|backstreet boys won my heart years ago. i have never been disappointed in any of their cds, this one included great group of singers
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Saw a commercial watched the first episode and then proceeded to watch the entirety of the season in one day. Hooked.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|Rather than overwork the phrase Motion Picture, the word Film can be most appropriate here.  Without offending anyone's philosophical sensibilities, could this film have been motivated by an entity out there, somewhere, such that the people in Hollywood created something intended to be singularly unique? For example, consider what the Director of this film did when he exactly provided for us the scene, frame by frame, when Cary Grant presents to us the Twenty-Third Psalm.<br /><br />Next, many may have also noticed that during the Golden Age, the cast for several films was selected in only one way that could have been possible. For example, can you imagine the roles in this film performed by anyone else other than Cary Grant, Loretta Young, David Niven, Monty Woolley, and James Gleason?<br /><br />Concluding, you will know what the word inspiration means after this film instills your inner self with a feeling of complete, the kind words here are now almost endless.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I hope this is the last book in the series. I found it too long and too wordy. I actually was growing bored with Tris ranting and feeling sorry for herself. I felt the author was being paid by the number of words she wrote. I don't think I go to see the movie.
0762777931|5.0|This book has humor, great advice and lots of inspiration.  I bought it for myself, my sister and a friend...  it is such a smart way to live that I want to share it with everyone!!  I highly recommend it!
B0070XFNDE|5.0|Excellent as always. Carlos Ruiz Zafon is a masterful storyteller. His characters are well formed and without guile.  He has weaved a story of evil and love forming a tapestry of life that affects all including the reader. Highly recommended
0061992860|4.0|....the zombie apocalypse happens, I wanted to have a survival book handy. After much research, this was one of the most recommended. The layman's terms and photos were very helpful.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|This is the best love story of all time. Everyone wishes that their other would do anything to remind them how much they loved each other. You will come to tears for them. The product came in good time and worked great in the dvd player.
B00FEAZGDC|5.0|I started watching this without expecting much, but by the end it had made it to the list of my favorite movies of all time. I was pretty much crying from beginning to end—so many touching and heart-breaking moments. Superb acting by a talented cast.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|The best girl movie ever !!!! Could of done with out some of the odd senses  though. It is a womans version of Strip tease the movie makes us happy
006202406X|1.0|I was counting down the days to read this book. I fell in live with the first two, and was eager to see how the trilogy ended. I was highly disappointed. From the start, this book was no where near the quality of Divergent and Insurgent. It took until after 60% to get somewhat exciting, and then BOOM you don't even want to finish the book once the big shocker is revealed.<br /><br />I am very disappointed in the ending of this trilogy...
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|You can tell all the folks involved in this were really starting to enjoy the roles and concepts. More depth and more commitment all around. Love it.
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|Meandering... Lots of story but no payoff.  Kept waiting for the story to develop but it didn't.  Lots of nice elements, enjoyable writing, but no power in the plot.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Wonderfully authentic! A glimpse into the glamour of the time, but more importantly, a realistic glimpse into the political and social changes and challenges.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game. All other games try to get you to spend money by not giving you alot of free play time. This game doesn't do that. I can play forever.
B003F44QRQ|3.0|Cult classic with 80s flair. This one has plenty of hair products including rinds of aquanet. Fun to watch during Halloween
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|You have to give Arcade Fire points for ambition. Since emerging on the indie music scene with the their lauded 2004 debut they've managed to become one of the most diverse and exciting bands of the past decade. All of this culminated in taking home a Grammy for Album of the Year for their third release, The Suburbs. They may come off at times as overly serious, heavy-handed, and a bit pretentious but I can't deny that they make music that sticks with me and clearly their ever-growing fan base is a testament to their talent for pulling people in with compelling music. At this point the stakes are higher than they've ever been and the band did a masterful job of giving us virtually no information about this record prior to its release. A subtle yet brilliant marketing campaign and a music video were about all we had going in. So can this Canadian tour de force pull off another ambitious effort, which happens to be a double album? The answer is...kind of but not really.<br /><br />By now most of you have probably seen the music video or heard the title track. It's a great opener and its disco rifts make it both danceable and slightly eerie. There's certainly a thread of LCD Soundsystem running through this LP and it fits the band quite comfortably. Songs like \\"You Already Know\\" and \\"Flashbulb Eyes\\" are remarkably fresh and bounce along with sweet melodies. \\"Normal Person\\" feels a bit more like their earlier material, a rockier and darker look at life that finds frontman Win Butler proclaiming \\"I've never really met a normal person.\\" When I think about it I have to admit I'm not sure I have either and then suddenly the genius of the song begins to take effect. The first disc closes with \\"Joan of Arc\\", a raucous and driving number that manages to blend French backing vocals with Butler's solid delivery. It's a great ride and closes the first disc admirably.<br /><br />Disc 2 begins with \\"Here Comes the Night Time II\\", a continuation of \\"Here Comes the Night Time\\" on the first disc. These songs give the album a bit more atmosphere and hint at the album's darker themes of isolation and death woven throughout the narrative. \\"Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice)\\" and \\"It's Never Over (Hey Orpheus)\\" are clearly sister tracks that flow well together. Butler has stated in interviews that the 1959 film Black Orpheus was a major influence and with these tracks he's given a new canvas to work with, complete with tempo shifts and dynamic ups and downs that make them two of the most fascinating cuts on the whole record. \\"Porno\\" recalls with 80's with buzzing synths, thick bass, and an electronic beat. \\"Afterlife\\" is solid but \\"Supersymmetry\\" is a dull and aimless closer that does little to bring the album full circle. Disc 2 is a bit quieter and more obtuse, meaning it'll probably be the disc that many really struggle with.<br /><br />This is an interesting album and certainly one with a lot to explore. However, I can't just blindly give them high marks simply because of who they are and ultimately I feel this is an average album. It lacks the energy and hooks of their previous releases, in many cases sacrificing melody for dance beats and tight grooves. The band is spectacular as always but they also sound more buried and distant this time around. To put it simply: there's nothing here that excites me the way previous tracks like \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\", \\"The Well and the Lighthouse\\", or \\"Suburban War\\" do. It's lacking a certain something that repeated listens have not yet revealed to me. Don't get me wrong, it's good and I'll come back to it from time to time. I just feel they allowed experimentation to overrun melody this time around and that keeps me from feeling quite as invested as I'd like.first disc.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Wonderful!!! I couldn't put it down. The characters were so real. This is as well done as A Time To Kill. Highly recommend it. Grisham's Best.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Without giving any spoilers, I thought the Trilogy was great!! The ending wasn't expected and I was on my toes throughout the book.<br /><br />About a third of the way into the book, I was skeptical about the story being able to be finished well by the end of the book, but it turned out to be a good ending.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who likes action and adventure. It is a dystopia similar to Hunger Games.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A story of those that act on fear and without facts to take vengeance on another. Power is all that counts. Ended is the unwitting player and tragic hero. Great read.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Great stories and acting as we expect, but sad to see the tragedy strike the family. Look forward to Season 4.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|I like anything Sting does.  The songs are music to my soul.  His music is diverse and &#34;bluezy&#34; in a good way.  Sting has done it again.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This big guy has room for my Dell M6700 laptop with a 17.3&#34; screen, plus it has room for all sorts of other stuff too. I carry a lot of &#34;stuff&#34; around for work, and this well built pack holds up to everyday abuse. The separate, padded laptop slot protects my most important (and expensive) tool. The stretchy shoulder straps are comfortable and adjustable. I've had Targus and Ogio packs before, and they did not hold up as well as this one. Hope this helps.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Just trys to get you to spend money to keep playing. I work to hard for it to give it to you.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Played this on my Kindle Fire. Fun Game, good hints and only one frozen scene... sadly it was the last scene so I didn't get a real conclusion, but by then I had it figured out.
B002W19I8U|5.0|The theme song was a bit too fluffy, but for something out of the Eighties, it isn't TOO fluffy! Fantastic.
B005544V6A|5.0|Fell in love with this show and all it's characters from the very first episode. I hope it runs for a long time.
B000WYCF6Q|4.0|Be cautious of the negative reviews. You cannot expect to get the kind of visability out of a little bike mirror that you get from your car's rear-view mirror.  This mirror is very good for what it was intended for.  The fish-eye style may seem odd, but that is what gives you the best visability in the smallest package.  It doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />If you look at some of the other bike mirrors, they may give you a better view, but they are huge and clunky. Ridiculous looking.  This mirror is tiny, compact, and simple.  And it does what it says it does.  I ended up mounting mine on the very end of my handlebar sticking out to the side a bit, and I can see everything behind me.  Of course, what you can see does depend on which way you are pointing you handlebars . . .<br /><br />The mounting system is simple, quick and easy.  It is a rubber strap that slips over a number of different plastic tabs.  Works great or a tight fit. The other great thing about this mirror is that it is very adjustable.  It swivels and tilts and rotates so you can position it in almost any direct.  I was very pleased with that.<br /><br />Go with this mirror.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW!! Extremely well cast, awesome and relevant story lines, gives one an appreciation for intelligent actors -- and hot too! :)
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This book is a compilation of real learning about lean startup techniques. The process and tools shared here helps tons of entrepreneurs around the globe.
006202406X|2.0|too many plot lines, sub-plots that go no where, new, one-dimensional characters, one rebellion after another. it felt like stripping a matryoshka to its very core, only to find...nothing. and really, how can Four/Tobias just go ballistic and inconsistent with his character, his very core, that was developed nicely in the first two books? I didn't bother to read past chapter 35. I know I won't miss anything. in the first place, I never developed a cult-like attachment to Tris the way I did with Suzanne Collin's Katniss, JK Rowling's Harry Potter, Lauren Oliver's Lena Haloway, Patrick Ness's Todd Hewitt.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|seen her live, it's better then the cd and that's pretty damn good. all songs are good this worth buying.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|This is a must CD to add to your collection.  Not only is her voice amazing, she also performed with Van Dkye. Awesome little cuttie!!<br />Amazon price is good and the shipping was deliveried as agreed.  Nice Work y

B0064X7FVE|5.0|it is awesome it never fails and so honest like it said there would be frost and the next morning there was. i like that it was honest and fast , i would recommend this to any one hoo want honest and fast forcast
B00E6F154A|5.0|bryan still has it, buy it, it won't disappoint. love every minute of it, especially the dancers who are in fine shape.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Packaging is great, liked the way it is arranged. Can't really say anything about the movies because I would hope everyone would have already seen them by now. The special features disc is nice with all the special features on one disc. I have zero complaints and would buy again and again without hesitation if needed.<br /><br />I would say this is a must have for movie collectors. The movies never looked better.
B0081336FO|5.0|I read the complete Sherlock Holmes by A. Conan Doyle when I was 13. This series follows it rather closely yet in a modern-day setting. The chemistry between Sherlock and  Watson is excellent, and I hope Amazon will put the third series on Prime.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I order this item on Friday and received it on Tuesday. The movie was new and was in great shape. My (to be) 4 year old daughter will be so happy!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a great device but it has a little growing up to do still. Currently there are only 4 &#34;apps&#34; that is supports. Netflix, Hulu and 2 Google play apps. Once there is more apps and support, it will be a much more powerful tool in home entertainment.<br /><br />Till it does, better to buy a Roku or other Internet Media Player.
B003VANOFY|2.0|On the good side, it is sturdy, the quality of construction is top notch.<br /><br />However the battery life won't last more than five or six hours which is OK for casual use, but if you are doing a lot of voice chat over a weekend, you find yourself having to recharge frequently.<br /><br />The weight is just too much even for a high-end headset.<br /><br />The audio quality is OK, but a $30 headset from Wal-mart nearly matches it and is light as a feather.<br /><br />The software drivers and interface with Logitech's master device suite is horrible.  Even the latest update leaves a lot of room for improvement.<br /><br />The mic boom is good but not easy to get back into place for ideal use.  So don't snack or have much of anything else to do when chatting.<br /><br />The upper three hotkeys are nice, but hard to pinpoint in a hurry.  Meaning you can hit the wrong button so easily as to make them of limited use.  There is little to know way of knowing if you have hit any of the keys too, such as audio prompts.<br /><br />Did I mention it was heavy?<br /><br />Overall, I'm disappointed.
B00BKZUVGM|2.0|I zoomed through this trilogy and was so emotionally broken by the ending I really wish I hadn't read the books or recommended them to my friends before I'd read the ending. I feel awful for them that they will soon feel the huge let down and disappointment I did at the end. What a waste of a life after her parents sacrificed themselves for her. I don't always need a happy ending but this one hurt, some memory serum would be great about now.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|It does a decent job with documents placed onto the Kindle but is limited. I works great in Word, works ok in Excel but does not allow for modifications to Powerpoint presentation although it presents Powerpoint very well. It is also limited in language fonts.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Sometime it is frustrating but I just love it .  So many of my friends love it too.just love it.
B001I45UFC|4.0|I read the entire series to my kids as they were growing up and now, traveling with my Kindle, I get to read the same stories to my grandkids; so much fun!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Love it,,nice setup,I've heard so I decided to try it,,really can't wait till Christmas to use it,then I'll know more about it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the simplicity of this game which has kept me entertained for hours.  I plan to be playing this for years to come and hope there will be surprises ahead.
B005TKD6NY|4.0|Very well written and thought provoking. Many questions left unanswered though. I guess thats the way its supposed to be.
B000V4NX04|5.0|Everyone should see this film, especially the young.  It is so relevant in today's world.  It is a warning of what could happen here.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|I think the grand children will love watching this movie when they come for a visit, the toy well it's for me it's too cute.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|This is a must have.  These guys are the real deal!  This band is about to be on mainstream radio and it will be well deserved!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|You can see the maturity in Kings writing since his days writing The Shining - which was truely one of the creepiest books I've read. His sense of character development, really pulled me into the storyline line. I was right there with now-grown Dan Torrance's story from the opening page. Over the years, I've wondered what kind of post-traumatic little Danny would experience later in life based on his child-hood trauma and how he would handle The Shine in his adult years?<br /><br />Would he grow up to be as wise and nurturing as Dick Halloran? And what was Dick's past experience with The Shine beyond what he reveals in The Shining? All of these questions are answered in Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />The introduction a new girl, Cabra, with The Shining adds an endearing and fabulous twist to where The Shining can take you. So while I related to Dan Torrance character from his childhood -- this was a completely new setting, new storyline. Nothing was a stale repeat that you can find in some sequels.

B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Its the real deal and a lot of fun for old and young a like. This really grabs your attention
B00G32PQNA|4.0|It's impossible to keep making sequels w/o something really significant. Honestly, I found the third time around with these guys less than compelling. I enjoyed it like I enjoy a dinner with old friends after not seeing them for awhile.<br />The acting was predictably great and the direction competent, as usual. The writing I'd say was excellent. I would give it 5 stars if I had only sen this one, but I had to take something away because of the warm and comfortable oredictability.
B005F3XV62|5.0|Love Kevin James. When He Did King Of Queen Shows I Knew Whatever He Do Be On That Show Would Be funny. Funny Is The Tip Of The Ice Berg.
