B00F91H666|1.0|Story was lacking and you there was no connection to the characters. Made the movie boring. I wouldn't recommend a buy or a rental for this movie.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|Yes look beyond the age group and find just another human being trying to fit in. This is a classic for anyone of any age to enjoy and relate too
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book because I wanted to know what I was getting into with the upcoming film.  Now I'm reading the entire series.  I couldn't put it down.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Fun! Love the background noises and changing outfits.<br /><br />Get a kick out of it despite not so challenging. A good cheer me up.<br /><br />Non-addictive.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|I heard a lot of really crappy reviews about this movie. The most being that if Brad Pitt wasn't the lead, it would have been even worse than it was. It took me a long time to decide to watch it. Honestly, we (my husband and I) picked it because we had ran out of options in new movies. This was it or nothing. So after a long debacle with getting it play (Amazon...I'm looking at you) we sat down hoping to get through it.<br /><br />I have to say it captured my attention to entire way! I won't go into movie details, don't want to give anything away, but I highly enjoyed it! I would be on the thumbs up side of an argument and would recommend it. Valuable lesson, give a movie a chance even if the reviews suck. It may actually be a good one!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Addictive! I seriously play every day.<br /><br />Level 9 somewhat disappointing. At 2nd place of all time highs in every category.<br /><br />You have to play forever for last 3 players to show in level 9.<br />One of which has to be purchased.<br /><br />Read to get past level 9 one has to avoid picking up coins. Did that nothing changed.<br /><br />Later after last 3 players appeared and my score was high said passed<br />Level 9. Did not show on progress-must be glitches that need correcting.<br /><br />You will get nowhere without moving up to next player and doing daily-weekly<br />objectives.<br /><br />PS I have still been playing and still on level 9 after my initial post. Perhaps a problem in this version 1.4.1 as my level 9 meter has never changed though I play every day and have researched info online to try and figure out why. I tried not picking up coins as recommended by some to get my meter to move and I play daily and weekly objectives ALL the time.<br /><br />I would love a TempleRun3 to come out!

1612680011|1.0|I read the book and loved it until I bought into his scam education courses. Weak on substance and support. His staff will not help you even if you spend thousands and thousands of dollars. you will get no where, because he does not care about you, only money. You'd do better going to a local real estate investment club where you will get the same information FREE.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|A fun and easy way  to do jigsaws but with no mess and missing pieces! No storage problems either. Very satisfying when you get the right piece in the right spot you hear it click into place. A great time filler in waiting rooms and relaxing  entertainment with a cuppa.

B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I can see why Olivia Colman won a Bafta for this. It's outstanding. I was completely hooked after the first episode and ended up watching all the episodes I had in one day (1-7). Anxiously awaiting the final episode now... Thankfully it airs today so I'll be able to watch the download tomorrow. Can't wait!
B000XUBC5E|3.0|Too much unnecessary violence. I prefer reading about the psychological aspects of the bad guy.  I liked his previous books much more.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|this set is irresistible, an absolute treat, for anyone who remembers the BTTF films from childhood or adolescence.  Lego has really done the films justice with this set.  I got this set right after it was announced, and it seems to be selling extremely well.  that's no surprise, because this is a home run for Lego's CUUSOO line (i.e., sets made by customer demand).<br />the deluxe combination photobook/instruction manual, with trivia from the film and a little blurb from Michael J. Fox on his Parkinson's research foundation, is a nice plus.  and Doc Brown and Marty McFly get terrific minifigures, and there are a number of highly customized/printed pieces unique to this set that will delight Lego collectors and BTTF fans alike.<br /><br />the only \\"downside\\" of the set (and it isn't really a downside) is that you'll have to decide whether to display it as the version from the first movie, second movie, or third movie!  (the set includes all the pieces you need to customize the vehicle for each film).  i ended up going with the BTTF2 version.  just be sure to have a safe place to store the teeny tiny highly customized pieces you need to switch versions (e.g., the personalized license plate).<br /><br />of course, not everyone remembers or has seen the films.  solution?  buy the trilogy on DVD or Blu-Ray to go with it.  problem solved!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I fell in love with this book! So much so, that I put off reading the last chapter until<br />I absolutely had to. I will miss Katniss, Gale, Peeta, and everyone else in this trilogy. It was great to know you.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|An awesome remake of a classic story. Great directing, great special effects, and the actors fit their characters incredibly well. The sequel was also great, and I can't wait for another installment. Well, well done.
B001QVFDA4|1.0|Amazon has a great infrastructure, however it does not meet the minimal requirements of a movie player with the Instant video. There are no subtitles or close captioning, after EVERY pause, the movie has to RELOAD.<br /><br />The movie is GREAT, as any Guy Ritchie film (except the one with Madonna, that one is a piece of crap). If you liked this one you sure will love &#34;SNATCH&#34; and &#34;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&#34;
B0019NB9A2|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time, period.  This is a classic that I have watched many times.  Never gets old.  A very influential film on future sci-fi movies.  This movie was made in 1956, but really holds it's own.  Terrific special effects for the period.  On blu-ray it looks fantastic.  Totally impressed with the picture.  The story is the strength of the film.  A terrific plot that really keeps you guessing and makes you think.  Loved it.<br /><br />The plot starts off deceptively simple.  It's the 23rd century (Star Trek, anyone?) and a US space cruiser, C57-D, has been dispatched to a distant planet called Altair IV.  Their mission is to ascertain the fate of an expedition to that planet 20 years earlier.  Happily they discover a survivor, Dr. Morbius.  However, he has no interest in being rescued and wants them to leave....immediately.  He tells them he cannot be responsible for their safety on this planet.  Under orders, the captain (Leslie Neilsen) has no choice but to land and observe/investigate the situation.<br /><br />Thus begins a journey into a very good movie.  I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll stop there.  I should also point out that this is not an action movie.  There is some action it in it, but it's not the main point of the movie. This aint Star Trek: Into Darkness, thank God.  This is a movie that relies on story and dialogue, instead of explosions and weak humor.
B00CZF87TY|5.0|This is a great combo of pop songs and orchestral music from the film. To the morons who are complaining that this album contains orchestral music, what did you expect? There isn't over an hour of pop music in the film. And if there was any doubt, why didn't you preview the tracks before buying it? Your idiocy does not merit giving this album a poor review. Unbelievable.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|This film was very disappointing.  When it was good, it was really good.  When it was bad, it flat out sucked.  It started off really well.  The story looked like it was going to be a winner and I liked where it was going.  Then it fell on it's face.  First and foremost, I was rather upset over the lack of Iron Man being in his own film.  What you get is scene after scene of Tony Stark running around playing a high tech James Bond.  No no no.  I paid money to see Iron Man, not his alter ego.  The title of the movie is Iron Man 3, not Tony Stark 3. I don't know if it's the fact that the producers felt the need to show Downey Jr's face over and over, or if they didn't want to spend too much money on special effects.  I don't get it.  Without the suit, it's just another movie.<br />  The next thing I had a problem with is the old tired worn out cliche of the wise cracking 12 year old kid who bails out the hero.  OMG, nothing kills drama in a film better than this stupid plot device.  Why was this needed?  How many great hero films have you seen that has a annoying kid rescuing the hero?  Batman Begins?  X2?  Iron Man I?  Nope, can't think of one.  I can think of plenty of garbage films that do though.<br />  The third thing that was a disaster for the film was what they did with the Mandarin.  I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it, but I cannot figure out why they would do this with that character.  It was incredibly stupid and made no sense.  Was it for humor sake.  If so, it was a huge FAIL.<br />  That being said, the movie does have some good moments.  The beginning is flat out awesome.  The ending is also pretty good and loaded with action.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Just start watching Season 1 and you will be hooked!  The issues and plots make you think.<br /><br />Wonderful acting and excellent writing.
1250030951|5.0|I'm not a young adult. I'm old enough to be Cath's mom, a young mom, but still. I do read young adult and children's novels frequently. FANGIRL grabbed me in such a way as to make it exceptional.<br /><br />But why?<br /><br />Was it the lovable, slightly pathetic, completely socially awkward Cath? Well, yes, in part. And maybe even though I'm more A than Y, I related to her because I spent much more of my freshman year shut up in my room reading than partying or mingling.<br /><br />Was it her brusque yet surprisingly warm-hearted and observant roommate Reagan?<br /><br />Was it mysterious Nick with the periwinkle wingtips?<br /><br />Was it Levi, who never meets a stranger?<br /><br />It was all of them. I laughed out loud and found myself smiling as I read this book. I powered through it in just over a day's time. It charmed me. I wasn't crazy about the ending, but honestly, that's probably just because it meant the book ended. There were no neat, tidy bows or over the top resolutions, but that was good. It kept it real.<br /><br />CONTENT NOTE(because yeah, I'm thinking about those like me -- moms of teens -- who are curious):<br /><br />Cath is a college freshman, so this is for sure a novel for older high schoolers and up (adults too, really, let yourself be charmed). College stuff goes on: drinking, sleepovers, etc. There's also a fair amount of language. But the drinking isn't glorified and there's no explicit sexual content.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|Very good CD listen to it all the time I have many of John Mayer CD none of them disappoint
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|tl;dr: You're gonna really want to hear the two bonus tracks in the deluxe version. Last Mile Home can replace one of a couple of songs in the main album in my opinion, and Work on Me could be the best work the Kings of Leon have ever released.<br /><br />I think the most accurate description for this album comes from the drummer, Nathan Followill, describing Mechanical Bull as an unofficial \\"greatest hits\\" of all the Kings' earlier work. There is certainly something here for every Kings of Leon fan. I think those that were expecting a return to Youth and Young Manhood will be somewhat disappointed, however, but that is not a bad thing at all.<br /><br />Don't Matter and Rock City most closely reflect the Kings' earlier style. Fans of their first two albums and of harder rock in general will find a lot to love about these two tracks, and I can easily see these two songs being favorites for many fans. Temple is a more classic rock hit which flows at a fast pace, but will probably find more favor in fans of the Kings' third album. Temple is definitely a showcase of Caleb's vocal talents.<br /><br />I think fans of Only by the Night will get the most out of Mechanical Bull. Comeback Story and Coming Back Again are both arena-sized rock hits, both signaling the Kings coming back to the album that propelled them to super-stardom. Family Tree in particular is Only by the Night with a blues rock spin to it. Fans of Only by the Night should definitely be able to recognize Crawl as Family Tree opens. Family Tree shows that the Kings can definitely pull off blues rock in a very satisfying way, and it's one of the more catchy tunes in the album.<br /><br />The rest of the songs tend to be more experimental. On The Chin is a slower country rock-style song, the one you would play for a buddy (or indeed for a brother or cousin) after going Back Down South and getting into a bar fight. Of their three slow songs on the album, Tonight feels like the weakest, and the weakest overallin the album. It shows promise, with Caleb showing flashes of ambition with his voice, but sinks into repetitiveness. Wait for Me also suffers from repetitiveness with a slow tempo. It feels like you're left waiting for an ending that never comes. It could be said that Beautiful War also veers into repetitiveness. However, the bass guides the song along a continuous crescendo, a la Bolero, and Beautiful War unfolds into a magnificent Kings of Leon classic. The second bonus track, Last Mile Home, is a happy medium, flowing along at a brisk pace but not overwhelming.<br /><br />Where the Kings really shine in this album are Supersoaker and Work on Me. These two songs are unlike anything the Kings have previously released. Indeed, they feel like they could be the first two songs the Kings really enjoyed making in a long time. Supersoaker, as the name implies, is a fun song. It will \\"red, white, and blow you away\\". The guitar is enjoyable, the bass sounds great, the drums are fun, and you just gotta love the lyrics. Supersoaker was a good choice as the opening single.<br /><br />The hidden gem is Work on Me. As most reviews focus on the songs in the main album, Work on Me has received little exposure. One of the few mentions I see basically write off Work on Me as a \\"Cure song\\". Frankly, if it was a Cure song, it would be the best song The Cure could ever hope to make. Robert Smith does not compare to Caleb Followill. Work on Me is all the Kings' strongest talents working together perfectly.  I personally cannot stop listening to this song, I've had it on repeat for a while. If Supersoaker did not blow you away, this song certainly will. The guitar in Work on Me does bring to mind The Cure, but on a completely different, much more enjoyable level. The bass is among the best Jared has played, and combined with the drums make for a great rhythm to this song. Top it off with Caleb's unmatched vocals and the song's fun lyrics, and you have a song that will make you feel great. If there's any song on this album, or even from all of Kings of Leon's catalog, that you should get, it's Work on Me.<br /><br />Songs like Family Tree, Beautiful War, and Temple definitely make this a good album. What gives it five stars is just how great Supersoaker and Work on Me are. If these two songs signal the direction the Kings will be taking in the future, it is something to look forward to with much excitement. Buy this album!
1592402038|5.0|Never (like, ever) would I have thought I would say a book on punctuation was...here I go...entertaining. Even further, it's also humorous. I found myself not wanting to put this book down, which still surprises me because of its category. I particularly enjoyed Chapter Three on the subject of the comma. Its history, purpose, and usage is all explained in a way that anyone can follow. The way the comma evolved from just helping a stage actor pause for dramatic breaks, when to take breaths, and enunciating and/or stressing particular words laid the foundation for its use today. Part of me wanted to travel back to ancient times and share with the Royals what I now know about the comma; this would lead me to become a Comma Celebrity! I'm only partially kidding, but the people who did, in fact, stretch the boundaries of the comma are noted for their contributions.<br /><br />All of the rules for commas are detailed and include examples by Truss. Anyone needing a simple, easy-to-follow guide on commas should pay close attention to this chapter as it can save your piece of writing.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is transforming in the way it weaves thread from the past of one \\"orphan\\" girl into the present of another \\"almost orphan\\" girl while giving the reader a profound sense of what it truly means to belong to a family.  Heartbreaking.  Uplifting.  Unforgettable.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The final book in the Hunger Games series brings the story to a good conclusion but is more fizzle than sizzle.  It doesn't seem to have the same tension and drive that pushes you through the other two books.  Still has a lot of action and still tries to surprise with twists in the story but ending is pretty anticlimactic.  But hey, if you read the other two, you have to read this one too.....that's why it is a trilogy.

This is a story of the rescuing good guy/girl who's smart enough to get the answers correctly and ensure that the correct answers are dominant in solving the problem.

B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I researched a portable power backup device quite a bit and the Anker name definitely received the most praise.  The product is slim and is about the size of a small smartphone.  The included, built-in mini-USB cable is convenient and the additional cable and iPhone plug is great.  Great small device to take while traveling internationally where power is difficult to come by or for those times when you're on the road with battery draining signals.

B00E68927E|5.0|Some might say that I'm a novice listener after only listening to Carcass for a few years. Symphonies Of Sickness, Necrotism and Heartwork were in constant rotation on my CD player when I first started. I have a firm understanding on their sound: they were early practitioners of grindcore and they evolved their sound into melodic death metal. Some would say that Heartwork was their \\"sellout\\" point even though they got little to no radio play. Enough about history. It's 2013, and they have their first new album in nearly 17 years. The sound is still very much melodic death metal, but with dark lyrics that bring to mind Symphonies Of Sickness and Necrotism. Longtime producer Colin Richardson (Napalm Death, Fear Factory, Machine Head) was at the production helm, but I read that he quit about a month into mixing the album. Only a few times that I remember have there been an album that he produced but didn't mix: Fear Factory's Demanufacture, Machine Head's The More Things Change..., and Napalm Death's Inside The Torn Apart. Not because he didn't try, but sometimes the band's wanted to go in another direction with the mix. For Surgical Steel, Andy Sneap (Megadeth, Amon Amarth, Arch Enemy) did the final mix and added his own flavor which resulted in Carcass, but with a little bit more grit & grime. You'll also notice that Michael Amott is absent as he's been busy with Arch Enemy and felt that doing a new Carcass album wasn't happening for him. Believe me, he is missed. That's not going to distract you from enjoying this album though. If you find this CD at a store, get the deluxe edition for the bonus track. It's cheap, and the CD is longer.

B00EP0KBXM|4.0|I had heard terrible reviews about this movie and braced myself for a major disappointment. After watching, I cannot agree with it being \\"lame\\" or a \\"waste of time.\\" I enjoyed it. It doesn't warrant a standing ovation, but it does take you on a mini-adventure. I thought it was a visually well-rounded sci-fi film in terms of aesthetic quality and design, although there was much more focus on the relationship between father and son. There are scenes between the two, mostly in one scene after the characters are initially introduced, where the acting does seem a bit contrived. Will's character does not always seem quite so self-contained as a seasoned high-ranking officer may be believed to be but there may be a deliberate thread of vulnerability woven in. Jaden's acting is a fit for the character though the performance seemed a bit rushed and raw in places. There was room for improvement. I may have edited the retrospective scenes of the sister differently, too. I was not bored at any point and I have seen other films much less-entertaining receive much more accolade.
B005M0R524|3.0|My less-than-perfect star rating is due to the fact that the consumer is not told that Season 2 is incomplete.<br /><br />I read some reviews here stating that the Christmas Special was missing from this set, but then I was reassured by another review that said the Special was indeed present, but it just wasn't labeled as such.<br /><br />(SPOILER ALERT) In the Season 2 Christmas Special, some major events take place:  Mary breaks her engagement to Carlisle, Bates is convicted of murder, and Sybil is expecting a child.<br /><br />This set of discs ends before these events, so the Christmas Special is DEFINITELY missing.<br /><br />You will need to purchase the Christmas Special separately.

B00AZRBLHO|3.0|As a programmer for 30 years, I LOVE the concepts that are espoused in this book. It is a great way to introduce the concepts, or remind people of them. The only problem is that the storytelling is mediocre.

I'm really happy that I finally got to it.  Old Man's War is a tremendous and confident SF debut for John Scalzi. His novel takes an exciting tale of alien conflict and dresses it up with interesting and intelligent themes of personal identity, what makes one human, the significance of mortality, and the ethics of being human.  At just over 300 pages, the story, peppered with remarkably well-drawn characters, never suffers from uninteresting and tiring chapters that plague so many debut novels.<br /><br />Scalzi begins his adventure by throwing the traditional military plot on its head.  The Colonial Defense Forces, or CDF, who serve and protect the human colonies throughout the distant reaches of space from the seemingly endless hostile alien races, have taken to recruiting seniors upon their 75th birthdays.  Granting them youth through a remarkable procedure that allows life extension, the CDF recruits soldiers with an entire lifetime's experience and wisdom.  In Scalzi's novel, there is no room for the weak or timid.  Aliens act like the aliens readers have grown up fearing, their cultures, morals, philosophies and motives are often muddled.  There is only one fact in the universe: real estate is scarce and everything and everyone is fighting for it.  The soldiers in the CDF are told from the first moment they become active members that they will most likely die before they can fulfill their three-year duty.  But the members also know that if they were to stay on earth, they would have most likely died in that time frame anyways.<br /><br />There are a few instances within this novel that some people might shy away from, or even be put off by, one of which is the presumption that humans would naturally have a default position of xenophobia if they came across any other sentient being.  In actuality, Scalzi is intelligently disguising our own misconceptions of foreign people.  When you think of it, here on Earth, we can't seem to get along with our own species.  Religious, racial, cultural, and political ideologies lead to war, and it usually comes down to land ownership.  All Scalzi has done was place humanities own situation in a SF setting.  He does so with more respect than most authors probably would have if they wrote this novel.  The main goal in Old Man's War is to question if what the soldiers are doing is morally or ethically acceptable.<br /><br />Although there are many deep themes that radiate importance, it never overshadows Sclazis gift for characterization.  His characters think, feel, act and talk like people that you know.  It's through his characters that Scalzi communicates the themes of the story.  There is always a feeling that death is right around the corner, and for the most part, the characters, specifically John Perry, the protagonist, relays this information in a portrayal that seems both realistic and eminent.  Continually, for Perry and his friends, their new bodies are an opportunity for Scalzi to reimagine the coming of age theme that is a staple of all war stories, not just SF ones.  Their rediscovery of youth is told through humorous events that lighten the mood when things get too dark and depressing.  And enhanced or not, Perry and the rest of the novel's cast win you over effortlessly.<br /><br />Although there is a ton of praise to dish out, there are also parts in the novel that stand out as poorly developed.  Characters will do really dumb things that get them killed, which should be avoidable given the type of training they do for war.  At these points in the novel, there are really obnoxious telegraphs that show the impending doom of characters, and yet they do not heed them.  The main character also goes through some interesting transformations that do not seem likely at all.  One example is that he survivesincidents that he should have died in, especially given the fact that so many other people die on the regular.  Overall, Old Man's War is an awesome book that will make tons of emotions emerge from the reader.  You will laugh, become angered, and possibly at one point become very sentimental, all of which add to the grandness of the novel.<br /><br />4.5 Starsincidents that he should have died in, especially given the fact that so many other people die on the regular.

0385743564|5.0|Steelheart, the newest novel from Brandon Sanderson and the first foray into the popular dystopian-YA world, is a winner. If you like those other popular books in the same category, ie Hunger Games, Divergent (the list goes on for a while) this is clearly an exciting new series with a unique look: a world where superpowers exist, but those who wield them, Epics, are corrupt and violent. 10 years later, what does the US look like? How do you fight back against these virtually immortal dictators?<br /><br />With a bit of Mistborn thrown in, we follow David as he attempts to join the very small resistance and do what he can to clean up the world. There's a touch of romance, though its complicated and looks pretty important for the sequel. There's plenty of action and excitement. Unique powers and technology. The book has it all.<br /><br />Still very kid appropriate, this book would be devoured by any comic-book loving kid 10 and up, in my opinion. A big recommend and a must-read for the kids!

0061711292|4.0|BEWARE OF SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!<br />//<br />//<br />//<br />//<br />14/09 - Reading this reminds me of reading Enid Blyton's Malory Towers or St Clare's school series, except with much more adult themes and dialogue. I wasn't alive during the 60s, so I don't really know how scandalised the readers and censors would have been by this book, but as I'm reading it I keep thinking &#34;I can't believe the censors allowed some of this subject material to be published&#34;. Not that I have a problem with it personally (I mean check out my reading list and you'll see how little of a problem I'm likely to have with the themes in this book), but I get the feeling that that open-mindedness wouldn't have been shared by the majority of the public in 1961. I mean they still had seperate entrances for boys and girls at schools, how would they have dealt with 10-11 year-old girls discussing/writing stories about the sexual intercourse of a teacher? To be continued...<br /><br />16/09 - Sandy's betrayal of Miss Brodie seemed to me like Miss Brodie was getting her just desserts. The way she treated some of the students who made up her 'set' - moving them around like chess pieces or as if they're her own personal dolls to be played with as she sees fit - it's not surprising that one of them turned against her. I don't exactly understand her reasons for wanting to set up Rose with painting master Mr Lloyd. I don't think Miss Brodie's motivations were properly, or at all, explained. She just seemed to have this long-term plan which involved Rose and Mr Lloyd having an affair (despite Rose's youth) but ended up with Sandy having the affair (which seemed to me to precipitate Sandy's betrayal), but the reader doesn't know why. I've always said I'm no good with themes that aren't glaringly obvious, so that might be the problem here, rather than the lack of explanation by Spark.

0345803493|3.0|6/11 - After the horror story that was reading Fifty Shades of Grey I had no intention of reading Fifty Shades Darker (which, from the title, I took to be worse than FSoG), positive that I didn't want to read another 'romance' that gave me nightmares due to the constant fear of violence towards the heroine from the supposed hero. But when I was at the library to pick up another book I had on hold I just happened to notice it sitting on the 'recently returned' shelf. Now, I'm a sucker for happy endings and when I saw Fifty Shades Darker I couldn't help but wonder whether it was possible for Christian and Ana to have a happy ending. Well, of course it's possible, the author is in charge of the story, but I wanted to see if the happy ending involved Ana giving in and doing what Christian wanted (not the happy ending I was looking for) or if Christian would be the one to compromise. Also I read another review that mentioned that you had to read the full trilogy before you could get a complete handle on any of the individual books, that you couldn't judge the series after only reading the first book. So as I opened the book and started the first page I said to myself, \\"This is a horror book, not a romance. If you think of it that way some of Christian's actions might not be so traumatic to read.\\"<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find almost no feeling of menace coming from Christian. If his 'new proposal' hadn't included throwing out the rules and taking corporal punishments off the table I don't know if I would have made it past the first chapter because, as I said before, I couldn't have stomached reading any more of that kind of 'romance.' Christian was much easier to see as the damaged hero in this compared to FSoG, where I simply saw him as a sadistic psychopath who liked to hurt women and call it love. I find it hard to believe that Ana would take Christian up on his offer of a lift to Jose's event, no matter how much she missed and still loved him. She was seriously hurt; emotionally, psychologically and physically (well maybe not seriously hurt physically, but definitely more than should be acceptable in that kind of situation); no woman in their right mind would see him again so soon after an event so traumatic. I have become so sick of the phrase \\"Good point well made\\" and if anyone mentions their 'inner goddess' I'm going to throw a copy of FSoG, in hardcover, at them. Also, how many times can a woman be told by a guy that he loves to watch them sleep before it becomes creepy?<br /><br />I read this even faster than FSoG, with only 1 break between 10 pm last night and 4 pm this afternoon and that was for sleeping, so this will be one of the few reviews I write that isn't done in stages over a few days or weeks. I don't think the writing got any better between this and FSoG, but the plot definitely improved and this romance actually has ROMANCE (phew!). While I never want to read FSoG again, I actually enjoyed Fifty Shades Darker and would even consider buying it if I saw if for 50c at my local library book sale, but I wouldn't pay retail for it, it wasn't that good. I just put Fifty Shades Freed on hold at the library and I'm actually looking forward to reading this one.seriously hurt; emotionally, psychologically and physically (well maybe not seriously hurt physically, but definitely more than should be acceptable in that kind of situation); no woman in their right mind would see him again so soon after an event so traumatic.

B0050OMJIW|4.0|7/4 - So far I've only read the introduction by Howard Jacobson and the preface by Heller himself (I enjoyed those two 'chapters' a lot, Heller's description of his attempts to get Catch-22 published were quite amusing) and a few reviews of it here. I am now feeling scared and unsure about the success of my attempt to read this classic. Most of the reviews talk about writing styles I have either avoided or attempted and failed, like stream of consciousness and disjointed timelines (I absolutely COULD NOT finish The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner, I had no idea what was going on or who anyone was). So now I'm scared this is going to be another of those 'classics' that everyone's read, and understood, but me. I just finished The Lord of the Flies and while I obviously read it, I'm not sure I understood it. Oh well. Isn't there a song along the lines of 1 out of 2 ain't bad? I don't imagine they were singing about the reading and comprehension of books but I guess it still works. To be continued...<br /><br />8/4 - Heller writes a sentence like I did when I was 10 - rambling and never-ending. Fortunately his exceedingly long sentences make more sense and are more interesting than my 10-year-old attempts. Love Dr. Daneek who does nothing but complain about his bad luck in being dragged into the war and visit his own medical staff everyday to find out what's wrong with his health, only to find that there's nothing wrong and complain about that too. That's my attempt at a Hellerish sentence (I never liked punctuation anyway, sometimes it's just too hard to know where and when to use it). To be continued...<br /><br />11/4 - There are some books that are funny and hilarious and even LOL. These are the ones that make you snigger or laugh out loud while you're reading it on a train full of silent passengers. You know, the morning commuters who quietly type away at their laptops or catch a few extra minutes of sleep before work), who all turn to look (and grimace) at you at the same time (kind of pod-people-like). Then there are the kinds of books that are amusing and humourous. These are the kind of books that might make you smile and go \\"Hah\\" under your breath without opening your mouth. It's the quieter more polite version of funny and hilarious. The more sophisticated and publicly acceptable way to demonstrate humour. For me, Catch-22 is definitely the latter (although I'm not all that worried about publicly acceptable ways to demonstrate humour, if it's funny I'm gonna laugh). There are many instances of, I think the right term is, irony, which for me are enough to put a smile on my face, but not enough to actually create a laugh. I don't know if that's my sometimes simple and sometimes immature sense of humour or if it's just not a LOL kind of book. To be continued...<br /><br />10/6 - This is such a complicated book to read and an even more complicated book to review. There are so many plot threads running through the book that it's hard to keep track of everything that's happening and who's involved in each thread. I'm nearly finished and I'm having trouble remembering not only the nuances of the 400 pages I've read but some of the main details of the plot. I'm going to have to re-read this a number of times before I can honestly say that I fully understood it - I think I might buy myself a copy as the one I'm reading at the moment is currently a week overdue at the library and I figure it might take me about the same length of time to read it next time around as it has this time. To be continued...<br /><br />13/06 - I found the conlcusion of the book to be possibly more confusing than any previous part I had read. Everything seemed to be happening very quickly, too quickly. Then suddenly the final chapter arrived, it was like a whirlwind that swept all the characters' plot lines along and in the confusion everything was suddenly, a bit magically, tied into a neat bow, when 20 pages back you couldn't imagine how the book could ever finish with any kind of proper ending. After I finished I was looking at some of the other books Heller wrote and was very surprised to see that he had written a sequel. Despite the open ending (Yossarian maybe/maybe not escaping the military hospital and getting to Sweden) Heller wrote for Catch-22 I would never have guessed that there was a sequel to it, it just doesn't seem like the kind of book (or Heller the kind of author) to have a sequel (or at least not a successful one. I mean how can you write a sequel to a book like Catch-22? I'm a bit scared to read it. What if it's not as good? I'm sure it won't be dreadful, but it might not be great and that would be a real disappointment after the greatness of Catch-22.k could ever finish with any kind of proper ending.

B002IXA5KW|5.0|Brilliant!  Irresistible!  What a surprise!  I thought I would read this novel as quickly as I would a standard graphic novel.  The story is told in the style of a dark mystery novel of the 1940s, although I believe WATCHMEN was actually written in the 1980s.  The compelling murder mystery, plot twists, dialogue, and visuals are thrilling.  All of this and super heroes to boot!  While the super heroes may speak from traditionally conservative or liberal political perspective, neither predominantes.  The novel's title and outcome remind the reader of &#34;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&#34; loosely translated as &#34;Who will watch the watchmen?&#34; or &#34;Who will guard the guardians?&#34;, a poignant and timely question for the current era in the US when individual freedoms are often compromised in the name of national security.

0385743564|4.0|Over a decade ago, an unexplained explosion in the sky caused ordinary people to gain supernatural powers.  Soon, thereafter, the strongest among them, who had come to be referred to as High Epics, found themselves battling for dominance.  In what used to be Chicago, now called Newcago, the Epic known as Steelheart won the battle for control of the city by ruthlessly killing off anyone, including Epics, who refused to bow down and be subservient to him.<br /><br />So great are Steelheart's supernatural powers that no one has yet been able to successfully challenge him.  This has led to most of the people in Newcago to think he's invincible, and to lose whatever fight is left in them, except for 18 year old David Charleston, who had witnessed Steelheart killing his father when he was only eight years old.<br /><br />David's father had thought that Steelheart was a \\"good\\" Epic -- someone who would fight against the \\"bad\\" Epics to save humanity.  But David now knows better, and he knows that megalomaniac Steelheart is not invincible, because he has seen him bleed.<br /><br />David has a plan to avenge his father's death and to rid Newcago of Steelheart and the other evil Epics who serve him.  But to put his plan into action, he needs the help of the Reckoners, a shadowy group of rebels who have killed lesser Epics by studying and then exploiting their weaknesses.  Given that the Reckoners had only killed lesser- and not higher-grade Epics, would they step up to the challenge and accept David to their fold?  How well thought out is David's plan?<br /><br />I thought this first installment in a projected fantasy series (the sequel \\"Firefight\\" is supposed to be released in 2014) had a well-thought out plot that moved along at a good clip and offered plenty of action and a little bit of romance and comedy.  Both the good and the bad guys played their cards very well, so the twists and turns in the plot will keep readers riveted.<br /><br />David, the novel's young hero, showed good intuitions and abilities to improvise in response to dangers and opportunities. The Reckoners he met had varied backgrounds and areas of expertise, and their passionate but differing views on what should or should not be done with megalomaniacs like Steelheart eventually came to inform him of potential holes in his plan and helped crystallize in his mind what he should really be fighting for.  So while David might have started his plan with only vengeance in mind, the path he ended up taking gave him a higher purpose.<br /><br />The novel's ending has a clever and also an open-ended component to it.  The clever component will give readers closure, while the open-ended component will set things up for the next possible installment.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the writing was very good.  The provided backstories for some of the characters tended to be minimalistic, so I did sometimes find myself having difficulties getting invested in some of them.  Their mysteriousness did serve a purpose in this installment, however, so I would urge you to continue reading for the eventual AHA! experience.

I've seen it all on tv, but it's still aggravating having to wait. Oh, and all the flash forwards are back to back in order in the bonus stuff. Although having them be out of order in the episodes keeps you guessing, it's neat to see it all in order too.

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Dream Theater's latest studio album is in my opinion, one of their top 5 best releases to date. After Mike Portnoy left, they took a different direction and went back to their early progressive sound. Dramatic Turn Of Events was a great album but Portnoy's departure was quite a change. It was an improvement over the last 3 with him but the band really finds their way again here. Mike Mangini's drumming has improved from his last effort with DT along with his lyrical contribution. Musically it's more diverse and has an excellent variety of their heavy and melodic side. The Looking Glass and Behind The Veil are completely different but both good tracks. 22 minute \\"Illumination Theory\\" is a progressive metal masterpiece which ends the album off on a high note. Dream Theater's best album since at least \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\" and so far, the best album to come out of 2013.

B00B8ESWAM|5.0|This movie quickly became my new favorite upon it's release. It is a fascinating story with superior acting by accomplished cast members.<br /><br />Contrary to the criticism, this film is not about Scientology or L Ron Hubbard. Although, as a Scientologist I can attest to the fact that this is an extraordinarily accurate portrayal of the early church movement and L Ron Hubbard. However the focus of this story is the human soul. It's a story about people - who happen to be part of Scientology. It's haunting, dark, and captivating - thoroughly disproving the notion of a \\"utopia\\" 1950s Americana.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|By sharing this information, I am breaking the first and second rules of Fight Club. I heard somewhere that rules are made to be broken so here goes. It is an amazing book and has instantly become one of my favorites.  One of the most original stories I have ever read. I love how it allows you to dive into the mind of an split personality type and helps you realize that you are not your kindle, your car, or your XBOX. They did an excellent job adapting it into a motion picture so check out the movie if you haven't had the chance. I am Jack's satisfied mind.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|The great thing about this film is, you don't need to be into the lifestyle to appreciate it. In addition to being an amazing film, the extras show you just how it was also a real life story of the triumph of the human spirit.
1401938906|1.0|I really believed that I could do these simple experiments and see results.  I have been reading these types of books for years.  But nothing happened and I really looked for Green cars.<br /><br />well whatever, I didn't spend all that much for the book.
B00AJFEHAU|5.0|I love 5SOS so much, but I read that there are only 4 songs. Does anyone know what songs there are? I'm guessing Heartbreak Girl, Beside You, Try Hard...
B00E687MWQ|5.0|And not available on vinyl???<br /><br />This album would sound killer on vinyl, it BEGS to be released on vinyl.<br /><br />PLEASE DO SO!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app! Love how it works! The keys are great size and the on going addiction lets me know where I left off...can't say enough good things!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|A fun and addictive game to play. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a big gamer from their mobile device or tablet. Worth the money.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|If you like period pieces, you will love this show. I enjoyed it a lot and almost watched the whole season in one sitting.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Not at all what I expected.  I was thinking it was going to be chick lit at its finest, yet the plot and wretched characters sucked me into this page turner.
B009WUBERW|3.0|They need to retire already, trying to recapture their youth is not going to keep them from aging. It was not plausible.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|This album is very consistent.  Alan Jackson's voice works better on this material then I expected it to.  This is Bluegrass Music done Alan Jackson style.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|Cons: it's frozen (become non-responsive) a couple of times, and the game timer sometimes keeps going after I leave the app (which I think runs the battery down).<br /><br />Pros: good challenging games at the expert level, highlights the row and column of the currently selected cell which helps when looking for patterns, and lights up matching numbers when you place one (also helps see which squares are missing a digit).<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars if not for the bugs.
B007C52NY2|5.0|I absolutley LOVE this trilogy! i get bored with books very easily and rather quickley. this has been the only book that has held my interest and kept me wanting more. i highly recommend this series.
B0088WLM9K|5.0|Too Bad it went off the air. Would like to see it come back or a movie made like with the original Stargate SG1.
0786852550|5.0|I picked up this series on a whim this year.  I had been reading some pretty intense books and wanted something I could go through easily.  Seeing the age group was young on this, yet the subject matter being exciting, I decided to go for it.  Let me tell you, I was surprised at how much this book pulled me into the series as I tore through the pages.  The characters here are so well developed - and the writing style is just wonderful.  I especially love the idea of foot-noting the thoughts and conjectures when Bartimaeus dictates the chapter.  I have to say, I feel in love with that surly little demon.<br /><br />I highly recommend this wether you are young or just young at heart.  The writing by Stroud is well thought out and the interactions between the characters is whimsical and keeps the pages turning, fast.  The action is like a roller coaster of fun and excitement.  He definitely doesn't let you down.  If you are thinking of picking this one up, just grab the whole series.  I promise you'll read them all.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was one of those books that I luckily found by accident. I first bought the second book In the series but immediately bought and read the original. I was pulled in to the story right away and spent the entire book (which I read in one sitting)trying to figure out what this town was really about. It took to the end but it was well worth the wait. I am now starting the next book and I can't wait. Definitely give pines a try you will be pleasantly surprised. It was well written and moved at a perfect pace.
0312370849|5.0|This is a story everyone should read; Sarah's circumstances could happen again, in our lives, if we do not keep aware. I was touched by sadness; I was elated with times of happiness. I did not want to put the book down! I definitely recommend this book about Sarah, and how her life affected many other lives. Masterfully written!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|we have been enjoying the fact that there has been new levels and everything! thanks for keeping it new with them! just an overall fun game that all ages enjoy!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Could not stop watching it!  Can't believe I have missed it for the past 5 seasons.  It was quite surprising at how many witty one-liners there are in the show.  Dark, drama with moments of laugh out loud hilarity.  I have recommended this to all my friends and sisters that are not watching it.  On to season 2!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Zombies...meh...Brad Pit...meh. Nothing new other than sound sensitive zombies that can move really fast and swarm. Just stick a needle with some unmentioned pathogen in your arm and they will ignore you. The end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game that makes you think but isn't frustrating.<br />It is nice for passing time or when you are up for a relaxing challenge.
1476727651|5.0|I had to take a break to keep myself from devouring it in one sitting. Mr. king is great. and truth I know the 12 step lingo. So I could identify.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|Studio Ghibli is masterful of telling magical stories about ordinary people, and From Up On Poppy Hill is no exception. The artwork is gorgeous, and the interplay between the two young people are just endearing. Definitely something you want to watch with someone you care about.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Anyone who has worked and lived in a small community and not felt similarity with these people haven't had their ears and eyes open. It was a dogged read yet I wanted more and at the end I was quite unprepared for the finale - a huge surprise yet with great insight and depth from Ms Rowling.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game fun and great to play even without purchases!! Can keep the kids busy for quiet time and fun at the same time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Hey it's Angry Birds, what's not to love!  Easy to use on my new Kindle HD and I could spend hours being angry at those dang birds for not stomping those pigs, first shot!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|There is some terrific writing going on there that is flying under the radar of the Big 6 publishing houses. PINES is one of those (Thomas & Mercer, and Amazon owned imprint). I stumbled across it and read it in one sitting. It's what I call a \\"journey tale,\\" wherein the protagonist is on a journey, literally in many cases, of discovery, and we are as clueless as he is until the denouement. Once I figured this out, I sat back and just let Crouch take me down the garden path. The truth that is eventually revealed totally caught me off guard--I had gone a totally different way in my mind. Some of the scenes are explicit and gruesome, but that is only a bow to the author's level of writing. This book is brilliant. I'm so excited to see there's a book II.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Now I can look up anything I want in this complete OT/NT version of the Bible and not have to worry about forgetting my book Bible somewhere out camping.  Plus, I can take my Kindle anywhere and still have access to my Bible as well.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is addictive, once you play you can't put it down.<br />I am having so much fun with this I recommend everyone try it you will feel the same i'm sure!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This makes it easy for me to search the web and get and answer emails from my Kindle.  It would not be so easy without it!!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love how this gal talks.  I've only done the first experiment, but just on the basis of her straight from the hip writing and her important analysis of how things work I have to give her five stars and two thumbs up.  More later.
B00DI75SWM|1.0|The app may be great but I'll never know. For some reason it doesn't appear on my device at all. So disappointed, really wanted to try it out!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Better than the first novel. Mr Child writes an amazing tale, one of those you want to read from beginning to end without ever putting down the book. Reacher is a character one can easily would like to emulate.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Good action movie i enjoyed the 2 hours of not thinking about anything.  Anything with Bruce Willis is good to watch.
B00BT70J7M|5.0|I've been collecting all things Kaufmann even though I've not a major Wagner fan; I am a fan of the Italian and French composers and all of the arias on this disc are a must have.  Having heard him in the past year, I was still amazed at the maturity and increased vocal strength he displays in this recording.  Absolutely fabulous!!!  As along, long time fan of Domingo's I was gratified to hear Kaufmann, years ago, display the timber found in Domingo's tenor voice.  This album confirms that distinctive sound and he excels to an extremely high performance level.  Question: does it get any better????  Don't think so!!  The Otello is heartbreaking!  The Aida, the best of any tenor singing today and then some.  If you love opera or if you don't and just love a great, great voice with impeccable musicianship and unparallelled emotion - buy this disc!  Love it!!
B00F91H666|4.0|The movie is a really good spence thriller. I hope that was the angle they where going for sense the movie does not really give off a horror vibe. Acting all around was pretty good it's defiantly worth a rent I would give it a buy since what makes the movie good is its spence work, my personal options is it can work for at lest two to three try's but after that the movie loses it's spence there go it's interest
B00D6BU8GG|5.0|I've seen all the Die Hard movies and this one did not dissappoint...  Good action and effects... And it good to see the kids all grown
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I thought this book would be shut in the beginning. I knew that most books or movies about video games sucked. Bust this book is truly incredible. It is a must read.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My niece brought them up on the net for me to see and then I watched a special<br />on PBS.  Had to buy the music.  One CD for her - the other for me!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I didn't know where this story would go with Gideon and Eva's relationship. After reading Bared to You, I knew there would be plenty to write about for the next book. I never saw the plot of this story line coming! It came at full speed and never stopped until the end. The sex was hot as always, but the utterly raw emotions that built up the story were amazing! My chest and heart ached right along with the characters. I could've wept right along with them. And the side plots were great as well. You'll laugh, cry, and hurt for the characters all throughout this book. A must read! How can Sylvia Day top this book in the last book of the series I have no idea, but I can't wait to find out!<br /><br />P. S..... I hope she explains the following things; the lipstick on the collar, why he had to take another shower, and how the furniture got messed up! Anyone know?
B001QMCJ1Y|5.0|A wonderful imaginative family film, one which our world needs more of. Kindness, thoughtfulness towards the animal kingdom, problems in human families happen, but can be over come with Love and Understanding, a/w/a Forgiveness. Far better than all the crap Monster and Video War movies which are poisoning our culture.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Well written, enjoyed everything about the book.  I could easily picture the scenes and characters.  Can't wait to read another one of his books.
B004AO4FJ4|3.0|Funny grate show for a Friday night family night, the kids love it. It has some thing for every age group.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Don't have too much to say about this one, the acting was good, effects were good, story.... kinda saw it coming. It is worth watching but don't think it will be a timeless classic.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Excellent background and analysis of his early life and growth, particularly his involvement with Apple. The book seems evenly balanced, but I would have liked to known more about others thought of him as a person; his business contributions seem to overshadow that aspect of his life.
B00E0SXNE8|4.0|It was interesting, not the best movie but it had a lot of heart. The comedy was okay, story seemed nice, it is worth watching.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Good movie for a Sunday night movie night. Awesome, brad Pitt was good and storyline was slow at times, but good.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I'm not going to complain about the freeware aspects of the game, as it is what it is. It is more fun to play on a touchscreen than my pc via Facebook, but some of the features are unusable on Kindle simply because the buttons are too small. That seems like it should have been easy to address. Crashes a lot, too.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have kindle fire hd.  This app is simple to load and use and over the past 9 months has not had any bugs.  Yay!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Fun movie for good time. Natalie Portman, one of my favorites, was good. The movie set up nicely future movies in the series.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|this app works great for what I use it for, reading books, magazines, and news while on the go. GH
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I really enjoyed the second season, although it's not historically accurate, it still follows the basic premise.  I actually feel bad for Queen Anne, she was simply a puppet for her father.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would be reading this book and all of a sudden three hours had passed.  Simply could not put it down. Great erotic fantasy. Couldn't wait to start book two!
B0018QXL1K|5.0|This album is loaded with hits and has that 90's sound and feel which makes us miss the times when muzik was great! Creep, Waterfalls, Red Light Special and many other classics make this cd a must have. I bought this cd when I was younger and listened to it religiously. Now I have no clue where my copy is so why not buy it again and forever have a copy in my &#34;cloud&#34;.<br /><br />Love this Album!!!
B00594XOZU|4.0|i love kik its awesome the only thing im not happy about is that my friends send me sketches n videos n stickers but i can't see them because kindle fire wont let u update overall i love kik
0073398101|5.0|as described with super fast shipping
B0049P1N3K|5.0|This book is enlightening, uplifting, motivating, and inspiring!!!  Excellent insight and formula for living, written clearly and concisely.  I highly recommend this book be read in sequence
B00B7Y0206|5.0|i didnt even know there was an app and was having a hard time getting videos to play but now that is not a problem
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Works like a charm. I now have the ability to print any document with my Kindle Fire.  Would recommend this App to anyone who owns a Kindle.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I am totally in love with Dexter and was glad that i got these episodes so easily and were good to watch
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|This album is a great comeback for the Queen of Music!! Cher sounds amazing!! This album has a mix of dance and ballads!! It's great there is something for everyone!!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|i love this app just as much as my nieces and nephew. it includes our two favorite things angry birds and star wars
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I can't even begin to say how much I love this book! Rainbow Rowell captured what it is to be a fangirl in a charming and totally unpretentious way. This book is truly magic I don't know how Ms. Rowell was able to do it. An original story, well two really if you count the Simon Snow excerpts, and fully developed and  brilliant fanfiction all in one book. Like I said MAGIC! If you read fanfiction and love it this is the book for you!
B003NS2T9G|4.0|Really liked this series. ( Almost better than Dr. Who--actually,  it would have been better if David Tennant had been in Torchwood )
B00A8ECU24|4.0|its a good game for preschoolers. the only bad thing is that you might need tonhelp your kids with thedifferent games within the game.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The detail is incredible. I cannot remember loving any book as much as I adore every book in this series!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is pretty boring. Nobody in my house really likes it. I am glad it did not cost anything.
1583334386|5.0|I stumbled upon this book by accident in the library,<br /><br />and I must say it is a life changer.I was that person that 'WISHED SHE HAD HIS WILLPOWER OR HER WILLPOWER' for years. Now I know I have to work at it to make it more effeciant and second nature in my routine. It puts everything we do on a day to day basis into perspective. Awareness and insight is what this book provides for me.. I actually ran out of times to check out so had to wait a week to recheck. I am reading it slow and letting things sink in because the information is tremendously useful and the excersices to work the \\"muscle\\" are also neat and easy to follow with practice. I recommend it to any person that wants to improve and regain control of their life(as cheese as that sounds). IT WORKED FOR ME.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I gave this as a graduation gift.  The young man just loves it and wears it all the time.  I cannot believe I got a Seiko watch for the price of a Timex!!!!  Way to go Amazon!!!
B005ZI2X4I|5.0|Great little book.  I can hardly wait to read it to my 2 grandchildren who live in Mass and love the first snow.
B00DAPOHU6|4.0|I thought Jack Johnson was on a progressive roll through the albums \\"Sleep Through The Static\\" and the tribute to his late father on \\"To The Sea.\\" \\"From Here To Now To You\\" slides back a bit from the seriousness of those albums, and Johnson revisits his well worn themes of being laid back and in love. He keeps the tunes in a mid-tempo mode, with sing song verses and easily memorable choruses. There's even a little trippiness, like on \\"Shot Reverse Shot.\\"<br /><br />There's also some fun to be had. The 'we formed a band when we were young' story on \\"Tape Deck\\" is about as funny as it is cute, and \\"Washing Dishes\\" is a clever come on from the hired help about the pretty woman he wishes would pay him more attention. There's also the serious side he's displayed since becoming a father as he sends his loving vibes on \\"You Remind Me Of You.\\" But the rest of the album is a casual affair, with chiming guitars on \\"Radiate,\\" the chipper \\"I Got You\\" and the ode to everyone's favoroite place to come back to, \\"Home.\\" Which in Jack's case is an Eco-friendly place with fruits and vegetables growing and laundry out to air-dry. And it's also home \\"where ever we are.\\"<br /><br />A happy Jack Johnson is still an enjoyable Jack Johnson. He's just not as interesting a Jack Johnson as the man who struggled through some emotional issues on his last two CD's. \\"From Here To Now To You\\" is a pleasant journey. I like it a lot, but wish that Jack was willing to bare his soul a bit more often.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is so cool. I recommend it for all ages. I think anybody could read it. It was such a good story.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Game is lots of fun and very challenging. Have played other games like this and not even close to the fun and challenges
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|You should consider adding more language options. I personally would like to learn Japanese with this app. I hope you consider this. Thank you.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest shows on in my humble opinion which is one reason why this series not only keeps getting awards, but also why this series stays on the TV lineup. I love the story and plot as well as the characters. The actors in this series completely make you believe that they are who they say they are and you get a true sense of family (though sometimes dysfunctional at times). This season did not disappoint and gave the viewer the humor and writing that you have come to expect. You really get to know the characters this season and if you missed any of the season itself, you are truly going to love it. On top of this the Blu-ray has some great add-ons that any fan will love!<br /><br />*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*
B002VUFKG6|3.0|Lots of stuff in this book--a little too cute at times and over dramatic, but I did keep reading.  I am very pleased with the bits of history I learned, but, Reader, be very wary of author's biases.  Maybe a good beach read.
B00C7607BC|5.0|For me, this has always been one of the movies that reinvigorated the Disney line of movies after a number of years of ones that I always felt were not as good as ones previous. The combination of plot, characters and music were perfect and in the end you get a movie that is timeless and music that you cannot get out of your head (can you say 'Under the Sea...'). I have been waiting for this to come back out of the vault as it has been one that I did not have in my collection for blu-ray, so I was excited to see that it is coming out soon! This blu-ray was great, digitally remastered, the images just pop off the screen and the music comes through in even greater quality and clarity. I highly recommend this to all Disney fans, as this is one that will not last long and it goes on the market in a little more than a week.!<br /><br />*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*
B003M70O5O|5.0|The actors in this drama are carefully crafted and fleshed out so that the viewer gets totally involved with their lives. Although I normally don't like watching this much violence, bloodshed or bad treatment of women, in this context it fits.<br />This show isn't for the faint of heart or children.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is simply amazing. It made me laugh and cry and it is just a very moving book. It's a book that makes you think and feel and really think about life.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent, easy to configure and works well. and the Build quality is more than expected.<br />Work well with my iphone and ipad. expecting more app to support it.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I love racing games. I used to play a game called Burnout and this is very similar and just as fun. Different races not just who wins first but elimination rounds and other themes I thoroughly enjoyed.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|loved every moment of it. Very fast pace movie and lots of actions and adventure. Maybe will even buy the movie.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Not sure what this was supposed to do. Thought it would be guidance or suggestions. It was a totally useless piece.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|(I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review)<br /><br />I read the blurb to the book and found I was very excited. I decided to give the book a go and was HOOKED on to it right from the start.<br />This book is a little slow as compared to a regular mystery and conversations, expressions even are explained very much in detail. Being interested in filmmaking, I realised this can be a great script for a movie!!<br /><br />The detective story was amazing. I enjoyed the thrill that comes along with reading a mystery and solving it along with the characters. Until the very end, I didn't realise who the killer was, simply because he was one of those characters who stayed in your mind but still stayed obscure.<br /><br />I found the crimes were gruesome and I had a very visual picture. It sort of reminded me of watching Criminal Minds,the TV Show. I enjoyed the book, even though it was slow paced. Some of the descriptions could have definitely been chopped off, but again, the writer has a ready script to sell to an interested filmmaker!! Kudos!! This will make a Good Film!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very interesting book. I was taken by surprise with the ending. Usually I figure it out but this one was a shocker.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is coll and you can play to facebook<br />is have 4 piste and you can buy personage you can upgrade the items.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun and quite addicting<br />Love the movie and now there is a game to it love it even more. Love it!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love the Mortal Instruments series and I have to say Jace is my favorite character in the book. Also I would suggest reading this book.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like to play this game<br />It has been a great way to waste time and have a great time
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love this book. I think the plot and characters are great and I started reading the rest of the books in the series
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Great characters, well- developed, not always like able, but compelling, nonetheless. I couldn't wait to see where each story would come together.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Speedy Delivery, perfect condition, and overall a working product that you get what you pay for. If you love the book, or even the movie, this is your product.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|The story kept my interest and the writing was good as always.  I would reccommend to anyone who likes a good plot.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|I love the case and feel. Not the best thing for safety though. I'm clumsy so I use this one for when I am at my job. Not gonna drop it. Hopefuly
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|At first I really enjoyed this game.  It started off fun and very easy.  And then came along the natural disasters that took you anywhere from a couple of hours to a couple of days to repair.  Next thing you know, a letter comes from your spouse saying \\"you need to buy a black cat or a peacock from the store\\" You think, \\"Oh I can do that\\" only to go to the store and realize it costs actual money to buy that.  There is one letter that I can't fulfill because I'm NOT spending extra cash on the game.  After playing this game for many months I have 15 letters that I can't fulfill because all of the require some sort of spending actual cash.  If that isn't frustrating enough, they send you natural disasters (flooding, stampede. rain, etc) that you have to create tools or medicine to correct.  It wouldn't be that frustrating if it happened once in a while.  But after you finally heal or fix everything in our land, you have 24-hours before another natural disaster or disease hits your land.  I swear I spend half of my day making tools or medicine because of all the disasters and diseases.  Today while playing my game, I had a fire hit my land destroying three buildings and three animals!  If that wasn't enough, up pops not one but three medical issues that require my attention.  So after today, many months of playing this game I deleted it because it started off fun and allowing me to do what I wanted to do, to me having to fix everything and not having that ability to play the game how I want to play it.  So download it, enjoy it, but just know that you will get disasters and diseases so much during the game that will take away from your game time and energy.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|If you hate the taste of starter fluid you need this. Two sheets of newspaper and a match and the coals are lit.
B00CLO3G54|3.0|Pretty cliche and predictable.  I didn't think it was nearly as good as the first SIster Act movie which we recently watched.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I could hear Neil's voice as I read through this novel, as if I had it on tape. He is such a magnificent storyteller. I loved the main character and found the story interesting and sometimes chilling. Neil captured the voice of the little boy so well. Fun read, full of magic.
B00CLNVOL8|5.0|Fast paced, funny and a good message.  I recommend watching this movie.  It addresses real issues in a helpful way.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|Well scripted and well acted. Realistic characters with great back stories. A fantastic addition to the Star Trek family. Worth watching.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|Starts off great, but gets a little slow at the end.  Overall, another great movie from Cohen that you should not show your kids! ha
B000FCKGPC|4.0|After three fast-paced, suspense filled books, I found this one to be... less of that.  Still quite good, and above average when compared to a host of other books, but certainly the slowest, thus far, in this series.  Knowing that there was the next book in the series helped me to plod through this one and, ultimately I found that the pace did pick up and that there is reward for patience and persistence as the story unfolds...  It's worth the read as part of the series.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Kik was great till I logged out, and told me every time  I try to log in, login failed try again in a bit. I restart my kindle and reinstall the app but it still  won't work!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I'm having silly fun with this game. I'm  taking care of a sick relative. Surprisingly I have lots  of free time but not the concentration to work, study or read so this game is keeping me sane.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Good way to pass the time on a cold and rainy Montana afternoon. Great graphics and many mind challenging puzzles. Well worth the purchase. Recommend highly.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is one of Clancy's best books in a long time. This is a must read for all Jack Ryan fans
B000I9U9A4|5.0|With a fairly accurate portrayal of the almost mystical and legendary naval combat in the age of sail, this movie captures the adventurous spirit of the age with the hardened grimace of Russell Crowe as he faces down superior odds and defeats the French with a bit of Russell ingenuity. I'd give it 50 stars if they let me
B0064MPXFA|4.0|It remnds me of Bill and Hillary. She is a lot smarter than she gets credit for. He gets blame for everything no matter who is responsible.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new update is buggy.  it was slow at first and now wont open.  it is a resource hog.  the layout is not that intuitive.  it wastes screen space.  bad design.  boo!  the old one worked at least.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love all things Sherlock so its no surprise that i am throughly enjoying this modern day version of Sherlock mysteries. Actors are suberb and i understand they getting quite a following worldwide. Well done series, looking forward to more.
B001N4RORE|5.0|My kids and our family enjoyed the music and scenary of this well-directed film. We highly recommend this film to all.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I picked this book for my book club and it not only made for a lively discussion about the book but about our lives in general.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My grandson loves this one. I ordered it for my kindle because he plays games on it.The games are for when he visits.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Best book of the summer! Easy to read, follow, and immerse yourself in anytime of day. I recommend this to men and women.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|It reads more like a chronology than a biography, but really interesting as an insight to the births of the personal computer and mobile computing.  Provides insight into design philosophy.  Too much attention will be paid to the person he was, but his impact was profound.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|The ending was very violent, but the apes were in control of there emotions.  The first part of the movie was the best part.
B00F91G5BS|5.0|I literally but my nails to the nubs! It was action packed right from the start! We are not zombie themed people, I didnt realize that what it was about, and we still loved it!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I love the books dairy of a wimpy kid. Greg shows more than half the boys in my class. I just love it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. My grandson tried this one first out of 10 new games I put on my Kindle. He loves it. I sit in the kitchen and listen to him. If there are more games like this one PLEASE let me know.
B009AMANBA|3.0|It was different than what I thought it would be. It was educational. It told a story that I am sure many don't know.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Fun game to play. We have the first Cut the Rope and when I saw this one I got it for my Kindle. Kids and I love it.
B000HEWEE4|3.0|I watched it once.  There was a scene where the movie froze.  I was surprised and a little bit dissapointed.  I haven't watched it since.  I'll see if it happens again, maybe it was a fluke.  This is one of the movies that I watch every time it plays on tv, so I finally decided to buy the DVD.  Maybe I should have gone with a more expensive version of the DVD.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I purchased this game for myself. I start at the 9x9 and leave the 5x5 for my grandson to do, when he sees me doing puzzles he wants to do them also, so I leave the easy ones for him to do.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Good price ,very precise.<br />Con is it is a little bigger for my palm. And settings above 2000 DPI moves the pointer too faster, even with two monitors.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|My son loves this game. The best is that it is basically the same as Mario bros . I recommend you get this game it is a fun game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a very addictive game.  Love all the families.  My kids really enjoy playing it as well.  Can't wait for a sequel.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|The goal of this game is to eat smaller fish while avoid larger one (in red glow). Coins are dropped after you've eaten a fish, pick them up and use them in the shop for upgrades. The bigger the fish the more points you'll get and more coins they'll drop.<br />There's also a points multiplier which increase as you eat in rapid succession.<br />There're also 5 different power up you can pick up during game play where you can activate for a short time period.<br />* Grow - increase your size<br />* Lure - create a suction to pull in smaller fishes<br />* Stun - protection ring that stun any fish it touch<br />* Speed - increase your speed<br />* Ghost - make you invisible to other fish<br /><br />There's 2 game modes, Adventure and Survival.<br />In Adventure mode, you can play through in Normal or Advanced difficulty, each having their own level progression although the stages and goals is the same. In Advanced difficulty, the enemy has a quicker reaction time and their field of vision is larger compared to the Normal difficulty.<br />In Survival mode, you can pick any environment you've unlocked and your score can be upload to an online board for comparison.<br /><br />Pro:<br />* Easy to control with 3 control option that fit your style.<br />* You can earn points and buy upgrade w/o the need to spend real money.<br />* Endless game play in Survival mode.<br />* Simple and clear graph.<br />* No ads<br /><br />Con:<br />* I wish there's more level in adventure since this game is so much fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story is hard to get into at first but before you know it you are totally into the hunger games. More,  to come.  I am off to book two.  I love my kindle.
B00CDBZ6NA|5.0|This is an outstanding book, about the nuclear weapons systems of the United States,and the many problems regarding the storage and use of them. It was really quite scary. The author does a fantastic job of reporting the facts, not being political( both republican and democrat presidents come off honest and believable regarding the use of such weapons) and the military whether being run by liberals or conservatives were u realistic 90 percent of the time, refusing to listen to and correct safety issues, and have cohesive plans for usi g these weapons. The scary part is the complete lack of concern regarding making these weapons safer, so that they can't accidentally detonate, or be launched accidentally. That people with very little technical training were allowed to handle and miss handle the weapons was astonishing. The fact that we did not have any major catastrophes is a miracle.<br />One thing the reader will see is that as the bureaucracy that dealt with these weapons got bigger and bigger the less control and supervision that was applied. The complete lack of any strategy for using these weapons other than launching all of them and wiping out everything.<br />The book focuses  on two main things, all of the nuclear weapons that the USA has developed, and a major disaster at a Titan II missile silo. If you like fiction such as Tom Clancy and old Clive Cussler, you will be blown away by this book and the fact that dumb luck played a Hugh roll in avoiding disaster.<br />An excellent companion book to this is Full Body Burden by Kristen Iverson, which details the same incompetence such as building it where they did and the  lack of safety measures employed in the making of plutonium triggers at the Rocky Flats site outside Boulder Colorado. If you are looking for more information regarding the history and making of the first atomic bomb you can't do better than The Making Of The Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes.<br />The reader needs to keep in mind that what is inthis book is only was has been declassified, or otherwise released, god knows, what else has happened that we don't know.<br />After reading this book I know that our government is too big to do anything efficiently, effectively, cost consciously, and provide the required resources and safety measures needed to prevent a disaster.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|WOW! I thought the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy, was the best love story.  I WAS WRONG!  The Best of Me is!  I cried, I laughed and mostly I loved Dawson Cole and Tuck.
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|Interface is pretty plain and needs improvement. Game play is good. I don't know that I would have purchased this game, however.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Great streaming of this film. Quality was great. price was comparable to cable.<br />The film was good.  Would recommend it.
B000W746GK|4.0|As an elder member of the tribe, I am happy to say, that this is a movie which most age groups can watch with pleasure (different though the source of gratification may be). It certainly helps to have seen the first movie in the series, however, one can catch on pretty quickly with what is presented here. If you have a choice, I would recommend seeing the initial movie first.<br />There are tricks galore and a sufficient number of stunts to enliven things<br />for even the Old Folks.  The acting is quite satisfactory, within the limits imposed by the many youths necessary in a film focused on the young. The older performers are mostly quite good without being allowed to overshadow the kids. As a matter of fact, one of the virtues of the film, compared to many with a child star (or stars), is that a balance is maintained so that the 'cute' young 'uns don't run away with the show.<br />I should add that were I reviewing for young people, five stars would have been appropriate; however, finding it impossible to take their role and judge what they might like, I advise only the adults (in years, at any rate).
B005544V6A|5.0|Very original and entertaining, character portrayals elicit immediate emotional response from the viewer. You have a full range of emotion viewing in every segment
0596009208|5.0|With a little bit of experience (basic OO concepts and programming other languages), this was an excellent introduction to Java. The book highlights and thoroughly explains some of the most important parts and best practices. It does not cover every topic or mind numbing detail of the api, but It DOES leaves the reader with plenty of knowledge to effectively wade through the Java docs online or in another text.<br /><br />This is the first programming book in memory that I've read cover to cover, keeping my attention through the later chapters. I typically lose interest a few chapters in and start jumping around. I cherry-pick what I think is important, and miss what's really important because it's buried in poor presentation. That's not the case here, this is definitely more Brain Friendly!<br /><br />I enjoy this format so much, I already picked up the Head First OO book and Design Patterns is in my Amazon shopping cart!
B0042L78MG|5.0|I could have bought for £9.99 here in England. So I will now always check other sites before your. The CD is great.
B00D8HNQZI|1.0|OK, so I will admit, I bought this album on a whim.  I was a fan of NIN way back in the day.  The last album of theirs that I purchased was Downward Spiral.  Actually, I lied.  That was a gift from my cousin Scott.  But I loved that album.  Pretty Hate Machine was awesome.  Broken was great.  This album?  Not so much.  What happened to the angry thrashing guitars?  What happened to Trent's voice? What the heck is this garbage?  It sounds like he took out his laptop, pushed a bunch of random buttons and said &#34;Hey, this sounds kind of like that modem noise crap that Skrillex guy puts out that the kids like so much.  I can make money from this!&#34;  Maybe it's because I'm in my thirties that I don't get this.  Heck, I bought it on LP to add to my collection where as most people that this is targeted toward will probably just illegally download it from some website hosted in a third world country.  Actually if you have a decent anti-virus program on your computer just go that route if you're dying to hear this/are a glutton for punishment.  I listened to about the first minute of each song before clicking the skip button, praying that I hadn't just wasted almost $30 on this mess (I downloaded the accompanying CD to my computer and listened to it that way... haven't put it on the turntable yet).  Not one redeeming song.  There is a song called &#34;Disappointed&#34; which pretty much sums up the entire experience.  I may have to just hurt myself to see if I still feel. (See how I did that?  That's a lyric from... no, that's not a Johnny Cash song.  Yes, Trent Reznor wrote that... No, Johnny Cash didn't write that and NIN didn't cover... you know what, forget it.  Shut up and go listen to Skrillex on your Beats by Dre.)
B003BWERF8|5.0|I purchased this for my wife so that she could use her older iPod while running.  For a Headset I bought the Alpatronix HX200 bluetooth headset and the two work fabulously together.<br /><br />I was surprised at just how small it was, it is not bulky, weighs practically nothing and work great.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|What a great duo of CDs! With the first cd we have pure Mule, and excellent at that! With the second we have other artists' individual and fine interpretations of  the same Mule songs. An all round exceptional listen! :-)
B00BTDD6BM|4.0|I really enjoy hearing new music from these guys again. There is some bad language on this new CD, but overall I like it. They still sound amazing. I hope they continue to make more music in the future.
1439156816|5.0|I wanted to buy this book for 2 years, but couldn't find it. Imagine my suprise finding it on Amazon (why didn't I try them first?). Stephen has given me more solid, practical and valuable information in his book than I've found in a dozen other so called writer's help books. He gets down to the nitty-gritty of writing that's good enough to get published. Kudos to THE MAN~~~
B000W796OM|5.0|I wore out the copy I had and needed a replacement.  I have all the books and movies and go thru them quite often.
0880796863|5.0|Have used with family and friends with great accuracy. I developed a relationship with the cards and found the guidance to be very close if not, pardon the expression, &#34;dead-on&#34; accurate. Important: must develop relationship with cards. Carry them with you when reasonable, leave them in close proximity to your bed or clothing in a dresser during the day. If possible sleep with the cards under your pillow or at the foot of the bed. I know it sounds extreme, but fellow Tarot card reader will know exactly what I mean. Take your time at EVERY reading. Take meticulous notes, especially for longer spreads. These cards are from the original drawings of those from the early part of the 20th century. For me, this is important. Others can make accurate connections with other tarot decks. There is no absolute right or wrong, just the power to access a more accurate reading from some someone who know the cards well. I believe the Rider Waite cards are the best.
0060012358|5.0|Excellent gateway Pratchett for children.  I loved it even as an adult.  As always, a well-thought out story, sprinkled with awful good puns, and a bit of social education.

B0035HKWLW|4.0|Jim Carrey is one of a kind. That will never change. He proved it over and over after The Mask. Cameron Diaz is lovely. Plenty of laughter throughout the movie and the original concept has not yet been replicated in today's technology, Kuddos for that!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is very amazing for kids and grownups.<br />I would consider this book because it's really fun.<br />I think everyone should be required to read it.<br />Well off to watch the movie.:)
1932100660|5.0|In 40 years I have bought and read at least 500 books on health and nutrition. This is the most definitive study on nutrition and health that has ever been written or perhaps will ever be written. The more animal products eaten the more sickness and premature death occurs. Campbell is not a shade tree mechanic.If I had to recommend just one book on health, this would be it. I encourage people all the time to get a copy and read it.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun and addictive I play as 'll the time and its great to pass time easily  recommend to all
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This is by far the most inspired album produced by Dream Theater in the last decade (maybe even longer than that).  Every song is crucial to the whole; nothing is filler.  If you haven't already purchased this, do so immediately.  You won't regret it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just got this game and I love it! First my brother got it, and I wanted it too. So, I got it and I am loving it!
B009GED1IY|3.0|The music was great!  Some parts of the movie could have been left out; not really required and didn't enhance the plot line.  My wife and I watched it with our 14 year old, thinking that the musical portions would be fun to see.  Unfortunately some senses just weren't appropriate and distracted from the movie itself.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Fans of the Harry Hole series will enjoy this younger Harry solving a series of brutal murders in Australia. This was the weakest book of the series, but still good.  There is a lot here that explains Harry's background.
1451627297|5.0|Absolutely loved this book - as with anything written by Stephen King.  Not too scary like most of his books, and has a very interesting time travel concept.  I couldn't put it down.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|NOT FREE!  Free just until you get drawn into the mystery.  Haven't finished the game, yet.  A welcome diversion from daily grind.
B009OYSFDM|1.0|Both my husband and LOVE Arrow. Love Hero Oliver his sidekick Diggle and Felicity! Look out Laurel Felicity may just win Oliver's heart!

B001NLKZUA|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Interesting turns and events! Full of suspense and very entertaining. I can't wait to start the next one!
0385486804|4.0|Jon Krakauer takes what is a very prosaic tale, a young, idealistic young man, drops out of society to live purely in nature, and turns it into a meditation on youth and its misspent energies, and the American experience of nature writ large with its harsh and beautiful lessons.  In the process, he made Chris McCandless into a folk hero<br /><br />Into the Wild chronicles the travels of Christopher McCandless, who after graduating from college, walked away from his upper middle class life (not even contacting his parents) to hit the road.  In the summer of 1992 he died of starvation in an abandoned bus in the Alaskan back-country.<br /><br />Very much in the American/Romantic vein, Krakauer tells the story of McCandless' increasingly drastic efforts to move away from civilization, to find that something-solid in Nature absent from normal human life.<br /><br />Part biography, part autobiography, Into the Wild  is about young men who are willing to take risks, and the American fascination with the wilderness; both the promises that it holds, and its terrible elusiveness.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a very interesting book that kept me turning the pages even when I didn't really have the time to devote to reading!
B00DHRLK84|4.0|This was a good zombie flick.  My greatest fear is that something like this will happen for real.  Pitt is always good and this movie is entertaining to the very end.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This is the most beautiful and accurate figure I've ever seen.<br /><br />She's very articulated. This includes the pigtails, head/neck, shoulders, arms, hands, waist, hips, legs, and feet.<br /><br />I'm very very pleased with her. She's absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend her for small children. And would definitely recommend her for collectors.<br /><br />She is worth the money.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|As always...great movie.  The science fiction is great as is the technology involved in the making of the movie.  Don't look for any underlying theme...just good entertainment.  Enjoy!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Best law show I've seen so far! Excellent actors, dialogue & plot! Each episode is better than the next. Watch this show :)

B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I love to play  Angry Birds after work. It's fun and good for relax. I have all Angry Birds games and I wish is more of them.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Normally I don't like &#34;flashback&#34; books or books that change perspective but this was written so well I couldn't put it down.  The end of each chapter is it's own mini cliff-hanger.  Couldn't get enough.  Didn't want it to end!!!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Sometimes it seems to be the same thing over and over. Loved the first 4 but I am getting bored.  End if already..

B00BUAEYVK|2.0|Sequels are rarely as good as the original films, and that holds true for this movie as well. An aging Bruce Willis with a couple of smart-aleck kids doesn't make for a great movie. I watch the earlier versions of Die Hard multiple times but I'll most likely not watch this one again.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|A good tool for managing multiple Facebook pages. The button for switching between personal and administrators posts didn't work as expected.
B00D7OXZTY|5.0|Since his triumphant sweep at the 2005 International Chopin Competition, where he won all five gold medals, Rafal Blechacz, now 28, has moved in opposite directions, becoming a musical hero in his native Poland but pursuing advanced academic studies too and giving relatively few international concerts. His debut album on DG of the Chopin Preludes gave indication of a superb talent, but the follow-ups have been rather low-key or specialized, as in his recital of piano music by Szymanowski. Now he returns to mainstream appeal with a disc of Polonaises.<br /><br />These works weren't meant to be performed together, and even though the \\"Military\\" and \\"Heroic\\" Polonaises are world famous, putting together an entire recital devoted to this one musical form is tricky. Pollini wasn't at his best when he tried, and unless you favor Rubinstein's rather refined approach to these extroverted pieces, there aren't any exemplary sets in modern sound that I can think of (I haven't heard Garrick Ohlsson's selection, however). So if successful, Blechacz's new set, which selects, as almost everyone does, Polonaises 1-7 (out of a total of 23 written in all phases of Chopin's career, back to age 7) would be a marked addition to the catalogue.<br /><br />Happily, this is a great recital, encompassing the two most popular Polonaises and one of the most artistically challenging, the Polonaise-Fantasie Op. 61.  On a fine instrument that is very well recorded, Blechacz has everything one would want - brilliant technique, panache, musicality, and a feeling for the peculiar inner rhythms that link the Polonaise to the Mazurka as the two most \\"Polish\\" of Chopin's output. Horowitz and Cziffra may be more electrifying - each was a unique showman - which takes nothing away from Blechacz's mastery. As much as I admired his Preludes, this album is better, with every mark of the mature interpreter and no trace of the over-trained competition contestant.<br /><br />I had heard knowledgeable grumblings that the pianist was consistently too loud on his recent U.S. tour, and at least once here, in the Polonaise no. 4 in C minor, I felt that Blechacz was too forceful and emphatic. Others might hear the same in the repeated \\"drum\\" chords in the \\"Heroic\\" Polonaise or the opening of the Polonaise-Fantasie. There's also a tendency to lean into the line a bit impatiently. Of course, with volume controls the issue of playing too loud is fairly moot. I hear no vulgar banging, always a temptation in the two famous Polonaises. Blechacz encompasses the thrilling F sharp minor Polonaise (no. 5) in one confident sweep. I can't imagine any rival doing better at conveying Chopin's heroic intent without resorting to Lisztian rhetoric. Although the Polonaise is a dance, these are often nationalistic demonstrations of patriotism, and keeping rhetoric out is an achievement in itself.<br /><br />In the end, such a long stretch of musical chest-thumping tends to be exhausting, and pianists are probably wise to program no more than two or three Polonaises at a time. Blechacz gives no quarter in his headlong enthusiasm to make these pieces thrilling, and the fact that he can is recommendation enough. For me, excess of charisma can hardly be considered a fault.<br /><br />(Reprinted with Permission from [...])that the pianist was consistently too loud on his recent U.S. tour, and at least once here, in the Polonaise no. 4 in C minor, I felt that Blechacz was too forceful and emphatic.

B001NLCBJI|5.0|This is a very lengthy movie. Almost two hour long. I like this movie for many reasons. First, the directors choice to open the movie with a young beautiful rear end relaxing in a room and than the trasitions to an old man in a taxi cab. I guess I was hook trying to figure out the connect between the two or when is the meeting point. Second I like that most of the scene are not related and unbalance which gives me the confusion effect to relate to what the character is going through. Third I like this movie deviate from the tradition continuity. Jumping from one place to another and expecting the viewer to have imagine the continuity of how the character get from one place to another with out showing every little step or have an insert or cutaway between different scene. Lastly, Im a foreigner and I can relate to the comedic affect that different culture and language barrier brought in to the life of the character. If this movie were shot anywhere else it might not as effective. Everything about Japan contribute greatly to this movie.
B00B19H2KU|3.0|While baseduction on a true story over all not frightening enough to really put a scare in to me.  a good thriller
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this app!! It is good quality and you can upgrade costumes to extras. The levels of the game are so much fun. MINIONS!!!!!!
0783226888|5.0|I ordered several movies, both came in a timely manner, shipping was good, and the products were intact.  Both movies were good for their time and both were movies I watched as a younger man and recall enjoying.  I was very pleased with the quality, packaging and the movies themselves were good too.
B00A4YZWN2|3.0|Very good read! Lets you enter a different world! Unable to put it down. Well worth reading!!! See for yourself
B007FG9LIE|2.0|As another reviewer said, the first half of the book is intriguing, although the main character's failed escape attempts become a bit repetitive. The second half of the book is filled with violence that takes place without explanation and for no apparent reason. The book also spends a lot of time reliving brutal torture scenes from the main character's military service. I started skipping over the violence and many other parts as well because they went on and on. The ending was particularly unsatisfying. I would have liked a lot more explanation about how the town inhabitants were introduced and acclimated to their new environment, how they interacted with one another in daily life, and why/how they became programmed to participate in group violence. I see there is another book in the series, and maybe that answers some of those questions, but I probably won't bother to find out.
B0007OCG56|4.0|Adam Sandler's best performance ever!  Subdued and realistic.  This is a comedy and a drama.  It is a film about cultures clashing between a white upper-class family and a Mexican single-mother and her daughter.  The family hires Paz Vegas as a housekeeper (who doesn't speak English...at least at first, but her daughter is fluent).  Tea Leoni is one of those people who wants to integrate the employees into her family and takes the daughter to get her hair colored without even asking the mother.  Paz Vegas, the mother, is trying to instill certain values in her daughter that do not include wasteful, narcissistic actions....which comes into direct conflict with Tea's values.  The result is some wonderful comedy and heart-wrenching drama.  The performances are wonderful, and story is multi-layered and interesting and the direction and pacing is great.  I highly recommend this movie.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|What can I say another solid movie. If you are a purest and only like the original stuff you may not like this movie. What can say but &#34;Alternate Reality&#34; so anything can happen. Abrams did a great job with this follow up movie, and I can only hope a 3rd installment is in the works, but please don't make a movie about the dang Whales.
B001LMAK88|4.0|This movie has it all!  It's very difficult to get me to watch a western, but this one was a joy!  The casting was perfect with Kevin Kline and Kevin Costner in the lead roles.  Everyone does a great job.  The storytelling has it all...dramatic tension and laughs!  The directing keeps the pacing exciting.  I'll let other reviewers summarize the story for you, I just want to tell you to watch this movie.  You can't go wrong.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I find it hard to belive that this was an authentic Sony PS3 controller. I just purchased a new controller at a local retailer and all the controlls were smooth to operate. The thumb controllers on this product were very stiff making game play very difficult and fustrating. Overall I was not happy with this purchase.
1423140605|4.0|While not as popular as Harry Potter, Percy Jackson deserves a read if you enjoy Greek (and in this series Roman) mythology. This story revolves around Athena (surprise) and it makes a good quick read for any age assuming you have an interest in Greco-Roman mythology.
B00EMJD6TC|3.0|***Spoiler*** A movie doesn't have to be just like the book to be a good movie.  By and large, I thought this movie was OK.  The action scenes were great, and zombies that can run always freak me out.  Brad Pitt did a fine job.  I appreciated the minimal gore for maximal impact.  I was disappointed that the climactic scene was just another run-from-the-zombies sequence with all of the cliche moments.  The movie had a few slow \\"look at what our world has become\\" moments, but it never really left me with the same sense of dismay at the plight of the world that the book did.<br /><br />And that's the part that is disappointing to me.  The producers snapped up the World War Z worldscape, but told the story in a way that highlighted the action scenes and followed a single storyline at the expense of the series of vignettes that made the book so compelling.  I couldn't help but get the impression that Brad Pitt wanted to be the leading man AND a cool action figure, but the interviewer from the book as the lead wouldn't have given him the cool action part.  So they wrote a new story that just happened to take place in the world of World War Z, and gave Brad Pitt his action.<br /><br />I have a tough time seeing the storyline move forward into a sequel from the point the movie ended.  They established that humankind had found a way to kill the zombies with impunity.  Not much drama in hacking down a bunch of animated corpses that don't fight back.  I suppose the documentary nature of the book leaves room for a sequel or two that are truer to the printed version, but I won't hold my breath.
B003NS2T9G|4.0|It's an interesting show. I have never seen a single episode of Doctor Who but this show was a good introduction to the universe and I highly recommend it for anyone who liked the X-Files.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Easy to use, user friendly. A good ap and one which cn be used on a daily basis. stands out with the better weather aps.
B000VZYPB4|3.0|It's a good show, but at times it's pretty clear that the actors don't really know what they are joking about.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|**spoilers**<br /><br />First, this film bears absolutely no resemblance to the book of the same name. The only thing they have in common is the existence of zombies, the title, and the worldwide scale. This film could only be remotely like the book if it were told in a documentary style with interviews of the various people. This film is basically Brad Pitt (Gerry) goes around the world kicking zombie butt and looking for a cure for the zombie plague. In order to review it more objectively, I am going to pretend the movie isn't called World War Z and put aside all my expectations and hopes based on that title.<br /><br />World War Z is an interesting film that brings up concepts I haven't seen before in zombie films. There aren't many that focus on what the government does during such a situation. Gerry used to work for the UN and he is basically told to help them find a cure or his family can't stay in the safe housing anymore. He flies all over the world chasing the origin of the disease and narrowly escaping death at each locale. The suspense is well done and builds in the right places. My favorite scenes were the zombies in the airplane and the claustrophobic journey through the WHO lab. The zombies are frightening and super fast. The solution at the end is temporary, but effective. Gerry notices certain people just don't exist to the zombies. He theorizes that those people survived a deadly disease and thus are an nonviable host for the zombie virus. This is proven true when he injects himself with a random disease in order to go bypass the zombies and return to his team with the diseases to test the theory. The film ends with a vaccine being made of a lethal pathogen to render the general public invisible to zombies. It isn't perfect and it isn't the end, but it's a good place to start. I like that all the ends aren't tied up with a nice bow. The theory makes sense and isn't something I've seen before.<br /><br />The film has a lot of flaws. I've ranted aboutit before, but I really don't like fast zombies. It doesn't make biological sense for their muscles and tendons to be magically invincible and able to take the stress over long periods of time. World War Z takes it a step further and makes them swarm in an insectile way using bad, cartoony CGI. It just looked horrible and made me roll my eyes. The film is PG-13, so although there are numerous zombie attacks, there is very little blood and gore. I'm not just being a gorehound here. It's a realistic part of being in a zombie apocalypse: people are torn apart and eaten everywhere. I felt like I was watching a watered down or censored zombie film. The zombie virus takes hold quite fast. There really isn't enough time for a person to board a plane and go somewhere else to spread that the disease. It just doesn't work in the scope of the narrative. The characters were less than compelling. Gerry only agrees to help save humanity because his incredibly generic family is threatened. I'm not sure if he thought that through, but his family is included in all of humanity. The situation with his family also makes the film just like every other disaster movie ever. It was frustrating in a lot of ways. It just goes to show that being the most expensive zombie film ever made does not make automatically it a good film.<br /><br />Overall, the film was ok: nothing spectacular and definitely does not live up to the hype. The novel is clearly superior on all possible levels. I would watch the sequel to see where it goes next, but I don't anticipate greatness.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Not a fan of Steve Carell but this is a very funny movie for all ages.<br />Watch it with your kids or on your own.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Well worth the long,long wait. Once I started reading,I couldn't stop. Stephen King rules again.l loved the whole concept. You will too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run was ok but this one is asome New characters one big giant monky<br />And New obstacles very cool get or else
B000C20VPA|5.0|We've been wanting this movie for quite some time, but have not been able to find it in retail stores. I was hesitant in buying a used movie online, but was presently surprised at the great condition the movie was in when we received it. We watched it that night and it played right through with no problems.  Would definitely use this again.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Very good game. Nice colors and challenging puzzles. My dgt and I play this together. We really enjoy it. She is only 6 and loves when she can make a match.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Makes time to by faster. If you have spare time like I do, download this game. You can not go wrong.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Epic movie, sad,  good for little kids,good for teens good for any one. My son loved it so did my 10 year old
B00EVLU2F2|5.0|Lush and beautiful. If you are looking for 'Strict Machine', keep going.  This is like French 78% dark chocolate after a lifetime of Hershey's.
0385523394|4.0|I heard how good the Netflix series was so I decided to read the book before watching the series. I'm glad I did because the book is NOTHING like the tv show. In the print version Piper goes in to detail around her incarceration as well as the ins and outs of surviving in a dorm of very diverse people.<br /><br />The only ding I have against this book is it sometimes comes off a little dishonest. Piper tries very hard to paint herself as this kind white girl who goes out of her way to break down racial boundaries and go above and beyond for the other inmates. I don't know if it's not 100% accurate, it can just come off as a little \\"preachy\\" at times.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good action movie with bad guys against the super heros and all the conflicts.  Enjoyed the fast action.  Have not seen the individual hero movies but had no problem watching this.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It just keeps getting better! Be sure to buy, stream, or rent this season. I can't wait to watch season 4.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love this world that Cassandra has created. It is so exciting and action packed. The only thing I did not like was the thing that Jace and Clary found out. That part sucked.
B005I4JG80|4.0|I am also a foreigner living in Paris raising three kids, and this book describes how french culture has also impacted my day to day life.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I like this game because it's easy and fun to enjoy with my whole family. Never boring or hard to figure out like candy crush
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love this program and have found that I'm exactly 8 times more likely to do the exercises on my tablet than on my laptop. The aesthetics are great, the functionality is flawless.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|We love the Star Trek movies and series. This movie was entertaining from the very beginning. Can't wait for the next movie!
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|love love love!!! I don`t know why I didn`t get it before ;) Its soooo handy, because I hate having to get my exercise videos out just for a 30 min workout when I can grab my kindle fire! And plus no loading which saves time!! And you can take your exercise anywhere and not worry about not service ( wifi)! Thanks amazon!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is my favorite CD of all time. The raw emotion in this album is amazing and unlike any other that I've listened to before. I love Arcade Fire and anything they make
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Ok, I've read the series 4 times and I feel it got better with time. Christian and Ana had interesting and adventurous relationship!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was hard for me to really decide if I loved or hated how emotional this book made me. I had no trouble relating to Hazel even with her cancer, she had much more to her then that.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is an easy review for me, because being that I love build it games, I am very picky. Like this one because it is cause oriented around animus and is a good game for kids. As far as graphics go, it is good but could be just little bit better, but there's lots of items to choose from, so that is definitely a plus.
0446585041|5.0|Ellen is so funny. Her mind wonders like crazy which makes it easy to read. I couldn't put the books down and laughed a lot.
B00D2BHO44|5.0|This is one of the best scores ever for a game! The music stirs up the imagination as you are listening to the point that you feel like you are right there with Joel and Ellie on their cross country trip. This is a must have in my books.
B00DU77QP2|3.0|City of Bones the Movie tied in well with the book<br />It flowed well but I think people need to read the book first

B006LSZECO|5.0|Thank you for making my 6 hour flight enjoyable. This book was such a fun and exciting read. It was a recommendation from my sister and I am so glad I purchased it. I was so engrossed in this book the flight attendant yelled at me to turn off my kindle twice before take off.<br /><br />I will add that I was slightly disappointed at the ending. But thas ok, you can alway have it your way.
B003K16P50|5.0|How could a movie really show the depth of human emotion and potential we all have for growth that is portrayed in this book?
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I am a dog owner and lover and this book absolutely melted my heart. It's a great read for dog lovers around. I laughed, I cried and I thoroughly enjoyed my journey with Enzo.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am new to playing but I like it so far.Wish it would wait longer before asking for a review to get a reward.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This is a good game for playing by yourself or passing the kindle back and forth.  Some other reviews mentioned showing the possible moves takes the skill out but I found that you could easily turn that part off so use it or not as you prefer.  I keep it turned on with playing with kids because it does speed things up if they don't have to count out each move, lol.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Wow! My wife and I really enjoyed it. A lot of good surprises. One of our top rated movies of the year.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|My first read from Archer was \\"As The Crow Flies\\" . I have been hooked ever since. \\"A Prisoner Of Birth\\"  was hard to put down.  LOVED IT!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this game to me and I'm glad I tried it out. Great graphics, interesting story, and challenging. I love the puzzles and since finishing the game, I've been looking for another one similar to it because I couldn't get enough of it! I am looking forward to the next room to come out.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|very very great and fast service!<br />thanks! I really love shopping on amazon! it has been a pleasure. thank you again.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|Solid, solid, solid.  Starts off with Supersoaker and contiunes to be great all the way through.  Like previous reviews, I think Work on Me and Last Mile Home are great and should have been on the normal album.  Def buy the deluxe version, hands down.
B009P1WES6|4.0|Sections of the book were pretty confronting but great suspense right toward the end.<br />Book was compelling but at times felt like you needed to step away from soem of the scenes
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Completely engaging.  Can't stop watching!  I've watched most of season 1 in less than a week.  Claire Danes is amazing.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|i think this game is fine it just needs to be fixed for the kindle version because on the plane game you need to blow to keep the plane flying but on the kindle tablet there is no blower detector so that round you always lose!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I really enjoy backgammon and this game knows how to move!  No dawdling. TYVM for the free game, I'm grateful

B00BMNM4H6|3.0|It's fun but its kind off hard... I like challenges but  I would not recamend it for those who do not like challenges and suger...
B00F91RYL8|2.0|There are so many reasons that this film doesn't work. Sure, when you watch fiction you are supposed to suspend your disbelief but... well, come on.  How ridiculous nearly every aspect of this film is- so many holes and attempts to hit cool marks that just plain fail.  A true waste of time.  I probably should give this a 1 star.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is  sooo cool  it is fun  and  I love it  I love  I love  the app<br /> I Lon how it is free
B005LAIIMG|5.0|If your a Brad Pitt fan or just love loads of zombies, then this is your DVD.<br />What sets this zombie movie apart from the rest is the number of zombies needed to make the scenes<br />of mass destruction and body count. Huge panoramic scenes of zombie kingdom!
B005JTAP4S|5.0|Peter: A Darkened Fairytale is a charming tale told in a series of quick reading chapters that leads you in and out of new lands, much the way Alice in Wonderland does. I kept wondering what new twist was about to come up, and loved each new direction!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The book for the main is as good as the previous 2 in the series and a great page turner until the end. Then it is like the author Suzanne Collins got fed up with writing the story and ended it with lots of things unsaid between main characters and no real explanation of the main character's thought process of her choices in the last few chapters. Quite frankly I was pretty mad and disappointed that such a great series of books was ended so poorly. It left me feeling annoyed I had &#34;invested&#34; so much time in getting to know the characters to be left feeling &#34;what happened here?!&#34;
B00340LM8C|5.0|Grace Kelley was gorgeous, smooth, and believable in her character. More importantly, she displayed a subtle playfulness. However, Cary Grant was at the top of his game as the star. All of his many and formidable gifts were on full display. The suave and charming manner, the grace and athleticism of movement, and the self-deprecating humor are all trademarks of this circus acrobat turned actor.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Another amazing album by Dream Theater.  I personally believe they are the most underrated metal band out there today.  Amazing musicians and songwriters.  I LOVE the 5.1 mix of the album.  I just sit in my theater room and enjoy the theatrical presentation of this album.  Awesome stuff by one of the best bands out there.
B0098460O4|5.0|I first stumbled upon Jonathan and Charlotte on YouTube with their audition on Britain's Got Talent. I recommend all check their audition out. I was absolutely amazed, the singing was jaw dropping and afterwards Jonathan showed real class and character when he refused to dump Charlotte at Simon Cowl's suggestion. Charlotte has proven herself to be a really good singer in her own right and the pair of them together is truly worth the price. I bought the CD and I can truly say I listen to it three to four times a day during my long commute to work. I never get tired of listening to these two kids.<br />  To those who say Charlotte is not up to Jonathan's caliber, I would only ask what singer would be able to match his powerful voice? She compliments him wonderfully and I hope they make many more albums together. I am looking forward to their new album in October and will buy it as soon as it is available.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I was surprised at the small size of this scanner, and was a bit skeptical at first, but I am very pleased with the quality of the slide and negative scans. I inherited all of my parents slides and negatives so I am having fun visiting old memories, and preserving them for the future!
B004U7MQYC|4.0|While I am often skeptical about movie sequels, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with Highlander Endgame. I am a late-comer to the series, only recently watching it on TV reruns for the first time this year and became a quick fan. When I read reviews of the Highlander movies, I was not sure I wanted to ruin my newfound adoration for the series. But I know when fans love a show or movie they can set standards pretty high for sequels, so decided to give this one a shot. I saw the first Highlander movie and enjoyed it and this one did not disappoint me. I was taken aback by a couple of details/characters they added to the movie that seemed a bit out of place because they were never part of or mentioned in the TV series, but being an author, I understand creative license. I was not overly fond of the final season of the TV series because so many episode strayed from the norm, and did not include the regular cast, but this movie was like watching an episode from season 4 or five. It was great to see familiar faces and tie up some loose ends. Won't go in to details because I hate when a review spoils the book or movie for future patrons but I thought Adrian Paul did an very good job reprising his roll as Duncan MacLeod.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|its a decent app. its a simple calculator and it does the job for simple math. no errors so far. im happy with it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was different and also a rather a quick read.  I enjoy reading a story that's out of the ordinary and I have to wait til the end to get the conclusion of the mystery.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I watched the Netflix streaming of this story. I know the story  was dramatized for tv, but the book to me, had no character depth whatsoever.  2 stars
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Heard so much about this book and have seen several film versions. However the book give a better understanding of the characters. Would recommend this book to anyone.
B0049J5EWW|5.0|Who doesn't love Toy Story? My son really enjoyed watching all of the charming characters. Especially cowboy Woody and Buzz Lightyear.
B000O77SOK|5.0|One of the greatest tv series ever. You've got to watch it. I'd love to find the others seasons. Do you know where?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This may not be the best Grisham novel, but it is one of his best in recent years. There was enough legalese to satisfy a legal thriller and enough plot twists to keep me guessing. In fact, I just reread this book. I read it when it was initially published. Good enough to read twice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandsons love this game it quick and they love the sound effects. I have even found a time or to that I've played .
B00EKJWS1Q|4.0|Trying to use full Outlook email through the web, will not function correctly. AND using the factory email app on Kindle isn't as robust as this app. So if you want to read, write and manage your MSN Outlook (formerly Hotmail) on your Kindle, you need this app.

B009JZSC9S|5.0|a very well written show. The individual stories are riveting and clever. The ongoing relationships with Alicia & her husband & co-worker is intriguing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have been enjoying this game quite a bit. I wish there was more interaction with friends...messages perhaps. I would recommend the game to anyone who loves horses, in fact I have and now they are having fun, too. Well done, good graphics. Oh! If there could be an instant replay on the competitions, that would be nice...I concentrate so hard on hitting the button that I don't get to watch the performance. Please add this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am so impressed with the first of the Silo series. It is very well written with so many unexpected twists and turns! I am getting ready to order the next book in the series.

B000002MUW|5.0|thanks for all your help i am satisfied with the item quick and easy<br />will use again have a great week
B00DF0POXA|4.0|Probably the first 6 times I listened to this album I just wasn't feeling it. Now I can honestly say it's climbing the list to be one of my absolute faves. The beats are raw, the lyrics honest and in true Kanye fashion there's no shortage of ego which makes it a perfect work out album. Like, just try lifting to \\"I Am A God\\" and not feeling a little like a god. My favorite song is Bound 2. The song really stands out on the record as unique-nothing else really sounds like it. It's a little sweet, a little arrogant, and just a good jam. Other good ones include New Slaves, Send It Up, Black Skinhead and Hold My Liquor. As you can see I've just called out 5 songs on an album of 10. Overall, this album is awesome and as much as I hate to admit it (I mean, the man is an egomaniac) Yeezus has done it again!
B00B7FXZQS|4.0|This movie definitely will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Was  not quite as intense as Paranormal Activity 3 but still really good if you like these kind of movies!!

B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|A great collection of songs by one the best artists of all time. I didn't know what to expect of this CD, rumors of a full dance album, other rumors of duets, standards and even country.  This CD is none of the above, yet something for everyone. A mix of uptempo songs and ballads, CHER's voice mixes well with all types of music.  My favorites are \\"My Love\\", \\"Pride\\"(bonus track),and \\"I Hope You Find It\\".  The deluxe version is a must and includes \\"You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me\\" from the Burlesque soundtrack. \\"Woman's World\\" and \\"You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me\\" have both peaked at #1 on Billboard's Dance chart.  \\"Woman's World\\" also peaked at #28 on the Adult Contemporary chart.

B00F91H666|5.0|Even though it was a Zombie movie, which there are many good ones out there, including The Walking Death Series, World War Z took a different spin on zombies and the plot was very good, it wasn't just about shooting zombies on the head.

B00DUGCLY4|5.0|fun and addicting. but it is hard because you can't retry levels and to get more points you either have to buy them them or beat the level...and by the way a lot of the levels are hard but that is what makes them fun!  i suggest this game!! PLEASE READ^^^^^^^^^^
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I can't stop singing all the songs.  Great performances by everyone.  I wish it had run much longer than it did.  I would have liked more story and more songs.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|Not to say it's my favorite; I can't narrow down Rush's multi-generational progression of sound to one best album.  What I do is divide Rush's discography into 3 main time-based divisions: Early, mid, and later. Early being everything from \\"RUSH\\" to \\"Hemispheres\\"('74-'78), mid being from \\"Permanent Waves\\" to \\"Hold Your Fire\\"('80-'87) and later being \\"Presto\\" and onwards ('89-present). In my opinion, \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" is the best of early Rush, \\"Moving Pictures\\" is the best of mid Rush, and Counterparts is definitely the best of later Rush. The other two albums i mentioned there aren't \\"definitely\\" the best because they don't stand out within their era near as much as Counterparts does in it's. \\"The Speed of Love\\" is Rush's most feel-good song ever, and \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\" is their best instrumental ever. \\"Nobody's Hero\\" is just beautiful, especially the ending with the huge powerful synth sound of some kind of electric orchestral strings. Geddy Lee's cries add such soul to the instrumental sections it's unreal. The lyrics are great all around, but the one's for \\"Animate\\" and \\"Alien Shore\\" stick out to me the most. Every song on this one is so atmospheric and emotional. The tracks reach out to you and bring you into their state. I think if there was one Rush album I would miss the most if I could never hear it again, this would be the one.

B009JZSC9S|5.0|One might think a courtroom/law drama is trite. The first three seasons of The Good Wife were so phenomenal, that I was a bit concerned they would not be able to keep the momentum going through the fourth season. However, the fourth season was even better than the first three! The show is adept at developing the characters more in-depth, and bringing back characters the audience enjoys. The story lines are intriguing, intelligent and shocking, but never gratuitously so. I highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys good acting, great characters, and a fantastic plot that ties it all together.
B007Z3763O|3.0|I liked the movie, but I wished the top of the case wasn't chipped. I know it sounds over the top, but I wished the case was in a more decent condition. Overall, I enjoyed the CGI.
B00915G6MG|4.0|I have really enjoyed this show over the years and this season was no exception. The characters are always fun to watch as they interact with each other a as well as pursuing the bad guys. You won't be disappointed and there are some ongoing things that last for than justb one episode. A nice touch for this show to lengthen a story a bit.
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|As other reviewers have noted, the AI does not adhere to \\"basic\\" backgammon strategy. The reason is simple: the probabilistic algorithm used to predict the likeliness is akin to the \\"randomizing\\" algorithm used to control the dice. Despite the developer's claims, no computer is able to generate truly random numbers unless it has a mechanical arm that can flip a coin, but that's beside the point. The fact that the algorithm controlling the probabilistic calculations of the AI is able to select the \\"best move\\" according to a (probabilistic) predictive outcome of future dice rolls (a feat that is not repeatable by a human) means that the AI will not play like a human opponent trying to maximize his/her score. The fact that there are likely two separate algorithms used to control the dice rolls supports the developer's claim that the AI does not cheat; however, I would venture to guess that the algorithms are closely related, and possibly built on the same base, such as pi or e, thus improving the AI's ability to predict, but different enough to make it wrong sometimes, in order to simulate mistakes. Rather it is the developer's clever programming that makes the game simultaneously challenging and frustrating. However, this is also what makes the AI game play unorthodox and seemingly illogical, and yet concurrently also seem like an adept and intuitive opponent.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We had watched all the episodes on Netflix and on demand and this was the one episode we couldn't watch so the $22 as worth it
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Like every entertaining series, it's the exaggerations and plot twists that make it addictive... even so I've known these characters in my professional life... not exactly lovable but definitely human... even some of the &#34;bad&#34; guys and gals have their sweet side and some of the &#34;good&#34; ones have a mean streak. Settling cases (and episodes) demonstrates why things don't always work out the way one might like.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun now that the bugs are all worked out. Great for the whole family. My kids love playing as much as I do.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|I love Dream theater, but after Six Degrees, I've found their albums lacking an overall quality that made me love their 90's work.  there were plenty of good moments and songs, and none of those albums are bad albums, but none of them grabbed me, for varying reasons I won't get into..<br /><br />But this album....  Wow..  This album feels so cohesive.  the songs are so well put together and there doesn't really feel like there's any filler moments, even within the songs, something that plagues many of the previous albums.<br /><br />John Petruci is in full form, doing what he does best, make other lesser guitarists look like amateurs.  The guy is insane on this one.<br />The bassist, can't remember his name, is finally audible, and he does a good job, bass isn't exactly the instrument I focus on in a band, but he does a fine job.<br />James is in great form as well.  The songs have been steering more back towards his vocal range, starting with Black Clouds, and they got it perfect on here.<br />Mike is a beast on the drums.  Sure he's not quite as good as Portney, but he's freakin' close and does a fantastic job.<br />And the most amazing thing of all... Jordan hardly ennoys me on here.  This is a guy who from Train of thought to now I can say I don't like one single note he's contrubuted musically.  That's not saying everything he's played has been bad.  The best has been serviceable, but finally there's no annoying circus music or western saloon piano nor any other completely out of place piece just to extend a song.  I still don't love his work on here, but it's ok.  Keyboards/piano, again aren't typically my main focus, though Kevin More did a great job when he was in the band.<br /><br />A minor complaint, there are only 7 actual songs, and 2 instrumentsls, but this can be fairly typical of a Dream Theater album, see Train of thought or Black clouds.  But, the quality of those 7 songs are all superb.  I'm not like a typical prog fan who only cares about musicianship.  I appreciate good good musicianship, and there's plenty on here, however what gets me with an album is having good songs.  Now good songs can mean different things to different people.  This album has good songs, in my opinion, to go along with great musicianship.  And there's solid variety.  You'll hear moments that'll remind you of 2000's dream theater, Awake, Scenes from a memory, and Rush's Moving Pictures album.  There are heavy songs, slower songs, well one, and some in between.  I never get bored listening to this.<br /><br />Enemy Within Inside 9/10 is a great metal track.  it's heavy.  it's fast paced.  There's enough variety in the riffing and John's solo is killer.  Also some great melodies by James.  Jordan's keys come the closest to annoying me in this song, but I can live with them.<br /><br />The Looking Glass 8/10 Do you recognize that opening riff?  It's a variation of Rush's Limelight.  I'm not quite sure how I feel about that, but it exists so I might as well accept it, and what we end up with is a solid rock song.  the verses are good.  The chorus is a little lacking, but it's good enough to hold the song together.  Everyone does their job just fine here.<br /><br />The Bigger Picture 10/10 is one of my favorite songs of the year.  Some call it a ballad, but really only the first verse is ballady, if that's a word.  It's piano based until the chorus comes in, and then the rest of the band kicks in, the second verse being much heavier.  I like the change in each verse, keeps the song progressing.  This is also my favorite chorus on the album.  it's very well done.<br /><br />Behind the Vail 9/10 is a nice prog rocker.  there's a great riff in the heavy verses which leads into a softer build towards teh chorus.  I would have liked the chorus to be heavier, but that's a minor complaint.  Overall a very well done song.<br /><br />Surrender To Reason 8/10 for now, but may change has more Rush influence, this time reminding me of Camera Eye from the same album as Limelight, Moving Pictures.  The first vocals are done over an acoustic section which would make an amazing verse for a song, had they chosen to go that route.  Instead it makes a great piece to a song.  Most of the song is heavier, with great rhythms and guitar riffs.  James does his thing on vocals.  Overall it's a good song, perhaps with more time I'll like it more.'<br /><br />Along For The Ride 8/10 is definitely a ballad, and a solid one.  The intro acoustic guitars remind me of the first acoustic song on the previous album, except I like this one a lot more, can't remember the name of that previous song.  There are some nice string arrangements in there too.  James's melodies are solid, and while this song doesn't get that heavy, the second verse does incorporate more electric guitars in the second verse and chorus.<br /><br />Illumination Theory emmm 7/10 right now, but that could change.  I've basically been listening to this album at work, and haven't really had the time a song of this magnitude takes to really appreciate.  There are heavy parts, and a softer mid section.  I remember solid vocals, however I can't really do this song justice yet.<br /><br />I hope this is a stepping stone to a consistency of great releases.  I freakin' love this album.  It falls in as 1B on my list of favorite albums, 1A being Crashdiet's savage playground, for a much different reason as they're a rock band in the realm of Skid Row or Motley Crue, but a great one for fans of that genre.  And if you like them also check out Reckless love, Crazy Lixx, and Hardcore Superstar.  I realize these bands may not appeal to a lot of prog fans, however I like them enough to feel the need to mention them for straight up hard rock fans.<br /><br />Overall I'm very satisfied with this release.  It's at least the best since Six Degrees, which if it'd been 1 disc would rival this more, however since it's 2 I would actually choose this one.  Ok so it's the best one, or myfavorite since Scenes from a memory.  Either way if you're a Dream Theater fan, especially one who likes or can at least appreciate all their releases then definitely don't hesitate to pick this up.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|This movie is great and a reminder of growing up in the 80's.  My teenage daughter now enjoys watching it and other 80's brat pack movies, which shows how timeless these movies are!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Kerman shares her experience with deep authenticity and insight. I loved it. It gave me a glimpse into a world i had never known.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Epic story. I couldn't put it down. The minute I finished I wanted to re-read it.  If you like Star Wars, hunger games, or 1984 then this is the book for you.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I bought this because my wife and I both loved the show, and I thought it would make a great gift. The episodes have not been remastered, but they look better than they did when I watched them growing up. If you are a long time fan like us, you will have no complaints. The packaging isn't the most snazzy you'll ever see, but at this price, it's worth every penny.
0770435726|5.0|I wish more books on the thriller shelves had this level of emotional intricacy. This is a spy thriller in every aspect, sacrificing nothing in action or intrigue, but it's also a brilliantly descriptive of account of one woman's internal life - the layers of contentment, discontent, cool-eyed assessment, and chafing-at-the-leash.<br /><br />Clever (and sometimes downright beautiful) language puts The Expats as possibly my favorite spy novel ever.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I finally read the series, and I am so glad I did! I think these should be read by everyone. The author's father's inspiration to teach his children and grandchildren about war and peace was a brilliant foundation on which to build such a spectacular futuristic world (although not in the too-distant future). A+
B005D9MUWY|5.0|First things I downloaded on every phone I get. I absolutely love the keyboard and the prediction. The cloud also added so much value to it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is fun and addicting, the idea brings you to a time of magic and childhood. Because when you play you care for dragons and raise them, only way it could be better is if we traded or bred with other people's dragons.
B00BFIFIPS|3.0|This slim armor style case is a good basic protective case and a good value for the money. I think casemate covers are better made but they are pricier.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great show. Already addicted! Love the cast and love the way the shows leaves you wanting more. Can't wait to watch the other seasons.
B00DHNB5CY|4.0|I read a few reviews saying it was a crap movie. They're probably hipsters saying &#34;I only watch when it's on VHS.&#34; This movie has some good funny scenes, scary scenes, and is a good time. It's only 90 minutes or so, which keeps the pace going well. Plus, that Oldsmobile 88 is in it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just recently started reading again and this book was an easy read.  It was amazing kept my interest from the first page.  Read it every time I had a chance. Can't wait to finish the other books.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season three was really good. Sad, sad ending, but I guess it is more true to real life. Characters are excellent!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|One of the best seasons ever.  Jacks teller gets to show off his leadership skill. Big fan of soa yeah
B004ADF7RO|5.0|This one of my favorite all time movies. And it never gets old. Glad I was able to see it again.
B0018TNMC0|5.0|I have read a lot of reviews on here saying the quality is not great.  Considering this movie was made 28 years ago I think the Bluray quality is great.  I do have a 55' 3d tv & that might be why it looks better on my tv than others.  I have no complaints about this movie or the quality.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Fun read. I like the characters and the world is interesting. The only thing negative I can say is that as I read it reminded me a lot of mistborn. Mainly with the group planning the jobs along with fighting a God like ruler. Also Calamity seems a lot like the deepness in Mistborn. Obviously it is a shard so it will be interesting to see how it all pans out.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|alarms disappear never go off. music stops randomly.<br />waste of money<br />don't buy or upgrade.<br />and the ads never went away either after I upgraded
B00CRMX53S|5.0|love this song.  it makes me smile and dance :)  Stephen Colbert does it justice when he danced to it ;)
B00992CF6W|4.0|It has creepers , zombies, skeletons and spiders along with survival and creative. But, it gets boring after a while but i did not delete it in case it gets more updates.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|Hidden Object - Home Makeover helped me realize a long-time dream I've had of cleaning up other people's messes. I don't know why this game made me so excited. I guess after watching \\"Hoarders\\" too much I now have an affinity for helping people clean their messes!<br /><br />But honestly, this hidden object game is really fun. And I'm an interior designer. (See? I told you I like cleaning up other people's messes) So the backdrops are really pretty and remind me of some of my past clients. Ah, nostalgia.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|I ordered the DVD after borrowing my son's DVD.  I wanted the movie in my collection of DVDs.  Clint Eastwood is one of my favorite actors.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book brought tears to my eyes for more reasons than one. Truly the best book I have ever read. I don't have much more to say except that I will never forget this series. I'm sad to say that it's over.
B000BW7QX6|2.0|The movie was good to watch.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A timeless metaphor applicable to all levels of politics, society, and the individual soul. I highly recommend this series -- hard to put it down.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|So enjoyed the relationship between Bob and his owner. The way his life was changed by the responsiblity of loving an animal.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Go in expecting action and violence and you won't be disappointed. If you enjoy Scifi and some gore this movie should be on your list of must watch movies.
B00EVN2D3O|3.0|Although it was a fairly good movie, I think they could have really added more magic and deception to the movie and make it less obvious as to the outcome of the movie.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Much better than the default static keyboard. Caps lock feature is not so swift, however. Room for customization in my book.
B00445RHKI|5.0|I love Modern Family - and I think Season 2 is one of the best. Very funny and easily relatable!
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|It moved way to slow  did not get into it at all. I only got the book because the movie looked interesting. Big mistake!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Big Bang Theory is so funny each season continues to not disappoint.  The humor makes me laugh out loud! I am addicted.
B005IQZB14|4.0|What an accomplishment...a story of growth and discovery.  I did not think I was going to like it until I became part of her story, rooting for her to finish.
B00821OX98|5.0|I also got into this quite a bit.  I need more to satisfy my sci fit urge.  Thanks for carrying this program.
B0012GMVG2|5.0|Very good band with 1st class songs.  One of the best for their time.  I was glad to find that it still sounds great after all these years to me.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Fast Delivery
B00063EMJ6|5.0|He was one of the leaders in the social movement during all the social unrest with Southern Man still trying to hang on to there confederate roots.  The guy who wrote Sweet Home Alabama remarks that no Southern man needs Neil Young anyway, referring to his song on this album &#34;Southern Man&#34;.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|When will be getting the next season.  I really like that you carry this high quality program.  Awesome amazon prime
B004EAQNO4|1.0|I don't know how to describe this movie, except to say that it's supposed to be a paranormal &#34;whodunnit&#34; in an elevator car. We already know there's an evil presence there, so there's no mystery involved. And all the trapped characters are bad people, so they deserve to be offed. Only recommended for someone who wants to watch a non-scary, non-horror, non-thrilling movie set almost entirely in a confined space (i.e. nobody.)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Thi  game is amazing but there needs to be other or cheaper ways to get people without just spending money and buying them and there needs to be more gadgets!!!
B00CSYR432|5.0|I'm sad to see that Mr. Miyazaki stepped down but his son is taking over and his son still lets him do a lot of stuff if he wants to, and this movie is something awesome that came from both of them and its kinda sweet and tragic at the same time. Well done studio Ghibli
B006IDG2T6|3.0|a very narrow take on the question<br /> yeah sure the scientific findings are accurate enough but in me  raised a lot of questions  and possible implicaions that the author seems oblivious to.
B0008ENICU|5.0|I love this movie. Fashion is wonderful, the women are Superb. Great girlfriends night in movie. Must see classic. Do it
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Just as fun as the original. Looking for a film with a deep story? Keep moving, nothing to see here folks. Looking for a fun, over the top flick, full of action and funny one liners? Step right up!
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I have long been a fan of this franchise and was excited to see it available for my Kindle Fire HD. I don't understand why I cannot build up any food when I am on level 23.  I work on it continuously and every time I make a little progress, I close the app and come back to empty counters!  I am so frustrated that I have decided to stop playing and am seriously considering just deleting the app altogether.  TeamLava, please fix this so I can once again enjoy this game and give this app the five star rating it would deserve otherwise!
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I'm addicted<br /><br />I love this game it's amazing ..<br /><br />Brilliant<br /><br />Can't get enough of it.the graphics in this game is awesome
B006HL9G10|1.0|this app stopped working for me after the last update. I spent $ on it but am now deleting it. I don't recommend this to anyone.
B0011FL7FA|5.0|Great Movie. Love the soundtrack also! Was glad to purchase the deluxe version. My first time buying an istamovie . I recommend doing this. Cheaper, faster than netflix, and you own it!
080419257X|5.0|This autobiography provides a very thorough break down of the different books/Gospels included in the Bible, and leaves the interpretation of each book to the reader’s discretion.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using SwiftKey for a couple years now on various devices and it's saved me literally hundreds of thousands of key presses. I love it!
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I have just got started it seems to be a good game. I like the information provided with the hints. The hints could be faster.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Excellent fun point shoot not too much to think about my kind of video game since I have no patience thus I love this old school classic
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this product because it's addicting and when your board you can play subway surfers I don't know what I would do with out subway surfers.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really enjoyed the Life of Pi. Was a very thought provoking book. A real page turner, couldn't put it down.<br /><br />(FYI I don't think a minimum number of words should be required to submit a review. Makes me not want to review a book)
B001JI72AI|5.0|Very entertaining, love true stories.  You're on the edge of your seat.  Great actors, good story line!  Watch it soon!
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio is so great in this movie. Actually all the actors are. All the emotion that was lacking in the the Robert Redford version is here in this movie. Its exciting to watch, and the music that Baz puts in the movie is a perfect fit in my opinion.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Strangely for someone who loves Pratchett and other authors of this genre, I chanced upon Gaiman quite late.  When I did, it was with this book; and boy was I glad to discover this wonderful author.<br /><br />American gods is a modern day mythology which is expansive in scope and filled with fantastical imagery - if you a mythology buff like me, you will love the (sometimes direct and sometimes oblique) references from actual myths drawn by Gaiman; if you are not, you will find yourself much educated from the reading.<br /><br />I like that the narration style is simple and uncomplicated.  It entirely follows the point of view of the main character and therefore compliments the main narration theme of being a 'hero's quest' which is, of course a very common mythological motif, and hence very appropriate for a 'modern myth' like this.  This also keeps us guessing about the real motives of the gods and other magical characters who are for most part, inscrutable and deceptive; which is again, as it should be.<br /><br />I think this is very much a seminal work and one which will outlive most of Gaiman's other works (a lot of which I have quickly devoured after reading Gods)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So disappointed in this novel. Didn't live up to the hype. The characters are whiny and the sex scenes are gratuitous. Wish I could get my money back and would have given it negative stars if I could have.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Great way to explain what happened before the first Alien movie. I hope they continue with a revenge sequence from where this leaves off.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great gadget for sharpening your pocket knife out in the field. Can't go wrong with this simple design. It works great!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I do NOT believe this is for children, despite the PG-13.I think the story line is more adult than teenager. If you like Matthew McConaughey & Reese Witherspoon , you will really like this movie. The movie is about two young boys encounter a fugitive and form a pact to help him evade the bounty hunters on his trail and to reunite him with his true love. Tye Sheridan, who plays Ellis, did and excellent job! You would not waste your money renting this movie.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Similar to Contagion, but with zombies!  The science is a little suspect. It's an action movie with Brad Pitt.  Sssssh, be very quiet.
B002QUWYWE|5.0|I'm your biggest fan,ha ha I loved this movie. My teenager wanted a suspense-filled movie to watch.  She commented on how they should win awards for this film.  30 yrs later a new I'm your biggest fan! Was born.  She commented the awards given were well deserved. Thanks
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|This was fun right away,but the program itself is full of glitches. the screen kept flickering.  it's frustrating that they would release it with so few levels and too many that say \\"coming soon\\" it should be all  or nothing.
B0089LOG02|1.0|The story line sounded so good but I will never know!  The profanity, particularly the \\"F\\" bomb uttered by teenagers was totally unnecessary.  I quit reading on page 8.  Not for me!
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I love this movie and the dvd was in awesome shape and played with no problems.  this dvd came in no time.  I would buy from him again
B003UESJF6|5.0|Had heard about this movie and read some reviews to decided to take a chance.  I loved the movie and it moved along<br />nicely.  A novel way for adults to look at the roles they find themselves trapped in. Even EVIL VILLIANS have feelings !<br />And Heroes can get tired of being, well Heroes. Lots of fun for all.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This disc is just a bare bones movie, with no special features.  I loved the movie and the way the not so pure motives of<br />Star Fleet officials brought this problem on themselves.  Lots of double-dealing by all parties concerned, and some nice<br />use of situations from some of the older Star Trek movies will keep you on your toes. To paraphrase Spock, &#34;Have faith<br />that it will turn out as it should&#34;.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|After reading the book and seeing the movie I felt as though I had been there. I also better understand Lincoln the man.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was expecting more. Well written but mildly entertaining for me.  I have never read any of her previous books.  Not sure I would recommend to a friend.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|I am challenged to find words to articulate how valuable this work is to my Spiritual and Emotional development.  I reached a plateau in my inner work and this book has moved me to the next level.  Not a book to rush through...you must work through it.  Truly a life reference book.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book, it's a great read...I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it to anyone! Great for all...
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very addictive. My son and I are hooked. You can't go wrong!!!!! Waiting for energy levels to build back up is torture. Please go and try this game. The game is not just entertaining but it also test you eye sight, agility and builds brain power. It challenges you in solving puzzles and cifeing words while trying to beat the clock. Exhilarating!!!
B00B7VZN76|5.0|Many fans cite this as the season where TNG truly hit its stride. Not only do I agree on that sentiment, but I also believe that this is the best of all the seven seasons produced for that show. Just after two awkward seasons that went through some growing pains, and before later seasons would get too caught up on the techno-babble nonsense with A and B plots that had nothing to do with each other (\\"In Theory\\" becoming the first of that type later in Season Four).<br /><br />What makes this a very good season isn't just a very good line-up of episodes that range from solid to excellent, but that there is a much heavier emphasis on the main characters. Michael Piller stepped in as the new show runner starting this season and made an excellent point that the reason viewers tune in isn't just for some good sci-fi stories but also because of the characters. It's the camaraderie, the family of characters that viewers want to see grow and deal with a situation in their own unique way. Episodes like \\"The Bonding\\" that really get into characters, see what makes them tick. It's this emphasis that began in the second season with episodes like \\"The Measure of a Man\\", but never has it been done better than in the third season, which even brings back Tasha Yar for one more episode to give her the best treatment she ever had on the show.<br /><br />As for the blu-ray discs themselves, they're excellent. The new features do a great job of getting behind the scenes on what really drove the season into becoming the classic that fans hold dearly. To get an even more unique sense of the family bond between the cast, the gag reel is a highlight. For any Trek fan, this is a must have. If you can only pick one season to purchase for TNG, this is it right here.
B00D3NSDVO|4.0|Reasonable writing, good plot & the pace was sharp.<br />It will be interesting to see if Terry Hayes can  keep up the standard in his next book
B008G59IBI|5.0|Just another great CD from Green Day.  Their music is good and entertaining.  Not often do I say that.  They aren't your everyday \\"boy band\\" or I wouldn't be listening!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|So well written - so real.  William Landay hit a nerve, describing parents' protective instincts and denial while exposing the frightening truth about their child.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was so different than the movie. A whole lot of parts were different. But this book was still good. This book was awesome. Can't wait to read the next book.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Why is it half the time it doesn't work? Actually I don't care why just fix it please. I'm begging you to fix it.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|My friend forgot this cd in my car the other day. Knowing my friend and his music taste, i was a little skeptical to put this bad boy in my car's cd player but I'm really happy I decided to go for it. At first, I found myself wanting to turn it off as soon as I realized this was \\"deff\\" not my type of music. For  w.e reason, I decided to let the cd  play a little longer. Half way through the album, I found myself not only enjoying the music but actually smiling  like a maniac. Here I was, listening to a random cd by a band I had no idea about and with a type of sound I had no idea I could actually enjoy. The same night, I drove back home from work and was really excited to listen to the cd again. Next day I dropped the cd off at my friend's and by the weekend I had actually acquired it. This cd has deff grown on me and makes me excited about maybe by any chance discovering another gem like this. If anyone has any recommendation of some other good music, I'm all ears. thank god for the greatest \\"accident.\\" The only downside? The album is too short. other than that. C'est magnifique! avoir!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I enjoy this game, though I have a hard time distinguishing which tiles are in play when there are stacks of tiles next to each other.  I don't think it's a problem with the game, I think it's just me...and maybe after playing it more, I'll be better at it.  The part I don't like is that sometimes when it goes to redistribute the tiles when there are no moves left, it freezes and I have to close it down and start the level again.  It has happened to me several times now.  I even tried shutting down and restarting my Kindle Fire HD in case the Kindle itself was what was freezing...but it kept happening.  Doesn't happen on any other games.<br /><br />I still play, but once it starts freezing, I give up on it for the day.  Also, I could do without ads after each level asking me to download some other game, but I guess that's what you get when you use a free app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved this episode. I was so shocked that when I recorded the series the first one was missing. So happy I found a way to seen it through Amazon.
B006LSZECO|3.0|but is does get better as the book moves on.  The prose does flip flop between decent and childish.  Good book to escape with.
B00CQZ65SI|5.0|Americans love Junk Food.  Salt, fat, and sugar.  Unfortunately, junk is good for the spirit and soul.  Djoko has some great ideas.  Check it out.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought this to plug in to a 32 HDTV that didn't have Netflix software pre-installed.  It picks up the network perfectly and streams HD from Netflix and Youtube perfectly, with no stutters.  I use my Nexus tablet or my Android phone as the controller and we couldn't be happier.  On a side note, the cord to the AC outlet isn't long enough due to where it is located on the back of my TV, so I plug it into my portable batter charger that I use for my phone and tablet and it works like a charm.<br /><br />Just plan on using it for it's intended purpose and you won't be disappointed.  Most people complain that it won't do X or Y, but we already know it only has a limited set of apps it works with, so why complain?
B004LROMWU|1.0|The first episodes drew me in, and I stuck with it longer than should have (to the first episode in second series). It gets worse and worse. Don't get sucked in like I did! RUN AWAY!<br /><br />It becomes clear that this is geared for young adolescent males. It is a 15 year old boy's fantasy. A teen boy and his dad are the focus. They shoot guns, play war together, bond, never bathe, strike rugged poses, walk through a vaguely war-torn suburbia (war-torn for the most part is over-grown bushes and litter). The girls are hot. Both love-interests for the teen-boy are blonde. One is girl-next-door, the other is trashy. They may have smudges of dirt here and there, but their pants are skin-tight and they walk like models. The main teen is, of course, a star lacrosse player.<br /><br />Most of the first season takes place in a school building, a place every teen-boy would love to see shut down, then converted to a war headquarters so they could strut down the halls with an automatic weapon casually strapped to their chest.<br /><br />As in a teen-boy's fantasy, there isn't much realism. More like convenience-ism. SO many plot holes. Really, the aliens use earth ammunition in their advanced weapons?<br /><br />The high school biology lab is the hospital. It always has one or two patients at a time- usually the principal characters. The hot doctor in boots has no problem being grubby as she works on patients. They made one raid on a drug store and never seem to run out of medications after that.<br /><br />Others have noted how hundreds of people in \\"the resistance\\" hang out in open fields, highways, public buildings with lit fires and all kinds of activities, yet the aliens with their superior technology can't see them.<br /><br />One major piece of silliness that I haven't seen mentioned in reviews is how dependent the refugees/resistance is on gasoline-powered vehicles. The \\"scouts\\" use motorcycles, for example. Yeah, those are so good for moving around stealthily. The \\"army\\" is wedded to big trucks, and only seems to be able to attack the enemy if they can drive straight to them. Even if they were getting gas from abandoned gas stations, it would be a finite resource, and a weak spot in their tactics.<br /><br />Bicycles, people, bicycles!  But, no big automobile/motorcycle product placement deals that way, I guess.<br /><br />The last thing is how \\"smiley face\\" it all is. Must be because of the intended family audience, but every time (and there are several times) where it comes down to the military authority apprehending a murderously bad human and you expect to see them lined up against the wall to be shot or hung from the nearest lamppost with a \\"alien collaborator\\" or \\"bandit\\" sign nailed to them, instead the head officer says \\"DON'T shoot them! Just let them go!\\"  WHAT??
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like it but I def would not have bought it if the price wasn't right. For what it costs it's ok. The netflix streaming from my GS3 always has great pic quality. I'm not someone who just sits down to watch youtube clips so that's not really helpful to me. If I could play my own local videos or music from my phone that'd be awesome. And with the future support from other apps like hulu, hbogo, sunday ticket (wishful thinking) it'll be amazing. But to be honest I don't use it as much as I thought I might. Being able to stream my local vids and pics from my phone to my xbox is pretty awesome. Not sure why this can't do it right now but it is only $35 soo....<br /><br />UPDATE: So I've tried the tab casting and it's really not bad at all. I'm using a macbook pro running OS X Mavericks. The picture quality isn't as great as streaming netflix or youtube but it isn't even close to bad though. I'd say its def a  step above standard def but a little bit below HD. I'm running a movie right now as a write this and am getting no lag. I'm also running it on the extreme setting. After reading other reviews I'm very impressed. It might be because of the new apple OS but I will def use this more. Also, now that hulu plus supports chromecast it is completely 100 percent worth it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is super cool and fun!;) its a fun game that really goes with the show!;) highly recomend it!!;)
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|Just like Book 1 (Beyond Bridalveil Falls), Beyond Oria Falls is was an exciting, fast paced read.  Readers continue to follow the story of Oria, the Golden Queen of the Ahwahneechees.  We follow Oria as she, her friends and elders must free the lost souls.  You are also once again thrown into the story of the great love between Oria and Grey Wolf.  Will Grey Wolf ever be found?  Will Oria be reunited with her soul mate? I'm not telling you. You'll need to read it to find out.  And I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  I read the first book in one day.  I was excited to receive a copy of book 2 and once again I could not put this page turner down.  A great read for all ages from YA Sheryl Seal.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have Nook as well and Kindle just updated many of it's features to mirror the Nook which definitely enhanced the functionality and readability.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|Game is good. Graphics and game play are solid. Lots of variation. Good tutorial. Multiplayer fails entirely. This version isn't comparable with the current version on Google Play. Wow, really?
B003NBFZTE|5.0|The RY400's really do the job.  I am a HS/College basketball official and I rack up a lot of miles on the court in the winter.  These are a lifesaver come the second half of the season.  I highly recommend them!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I almost feel like I'm watching a Twilight Movie. I mean, like the whole star crossed lover thing. There is a lot of &#34;kissing&#34; :P. The character development is amazing; how they jumped into the games with all the characters. The way Suzanne Collins made Katniss' personality is really interesting. So overall, this is a great book!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|What a thrill packed read! Lots of suspense. I would recommend this book to anyone. This book is a genre buster.
B00D6DVSAE|2.0|First of all, I am a huge Sting fan.  I buy tix to everyone of his shows when he tours any city remotely close to Dallas, I have all the CDs and books, and have even shaken the guy's hand at a meet-and-greet.  Just like every other Sting fan, I've waited the long ten years for him to finally put out some new music.  Wow.  Talk about unfulfilling.  It's sorta like the anticipation of waiting a long time for a big gift, and when you open it, it's a pair of socks.<br /><br />I \\"get it\\" that he wanted to do something different, so he writes and does this whole CD about his family history, the shipyard town he lived in, yada yada, and that this is being made into a musical.  Okay, then, really..... this should have been marketed or labeled as the soundtrack to that musical.  I counted only three songs on the 2-disc set that are remotely bearable.  The rest are kitschy, jig-sounding Irish-pub songs.  Completely disappointing.<br /><br />If you aren't a broadway show fan or a fan of \\"ye olde motherland\\" music, this isn't the Sting CD for you.  If I could return the disc for a full refund, I would.  It's that bad.  I would have given it only one star, but it gains a second star based solely on the fact that it is Mr. Sumner's voice on the majority of the songs.  With his deep raspy voice, the guy could read listings out of the yellow pages and have a hit.
B00DGGIXS6|2.0|What a damn shame to wait over 10 years for a new Cher cd and hear this nonsense.  Way too much auto tune tells me that her voice is shot  and all the tracks sound like crappy top 40 garbage.  Cher is so much better than this showing. She should have stopped and retired after the believe cd.
0316056863|5.0|This book cracked me up.  Was hard to put down.  If you are into female comedic books, this one generously fits the bill.  Her descriptive monologues really give the reader a &#34;picture&#34; of what's going on.  Some of her stuff was truly laugh-out-loud funny.  I can't wait for this to &#34;get old&#34; so I can read it again.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|I never understood the love that was heaped on the last Dream Theater album. To me it was more of part 2 to FII. It was overly commercial with awful chours and boring songs. I mean Break me Down has to be one of DT worst songs ever.<br /><br />And yet I was in the minority. I thought that I may have lost DT forever. That they would continue with the sound that the fans loved and they got nominated for an award for.<br /><br />Enter DT self titled album. This is a return to form that everyone has been waiting for. Just a fantastic album from start to finish. I was worried that Portnoy's departure was going to take away their edge (an edge they lost on the ADTOE). However having MM there for the whole process I can honestly say that this is about as good as anything with MP.<br /><br />SFAM is still my all time fav. and I need to listen to this one a few more times to decided where it's rankings and it's true star rating deserve to be. But so far it seems that it will be high on both.
0385349947|5.0|It is an interesting and practical book especially for women development.  I recomend it to all our coworkers who are interesting to develop her roles in the society and work.<br /><br />Thank you!
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I could have guessed most of the story line before finishing the book.  The characters seemed stilted.  The love story alternating with ugly violence was jarring and disagreeable.  Not one of my favorites.

B000FC11A6|5.0|The first scene is unforgettable and it brought me back to this book which I had abandoned halfway through on the first attempt. This time it took me two full weeks but I finished it and I enjoyed it very much. I do not relate so much to Randy and Avi but the two intertwined WWII stories of Marine Bobby Shaftoe and decrypter extraordinaire Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, together with all the amazing idea of the world's gold moving through the globe as a result of the war pulled the book together wonderfully. The story of how cryptography comes into its own during WWII is of course not new, but the breadth and spread of the organisation depicted in this book makes it easier to understand the importance of counterintelligence in the war strategy. I found the Shanghai part, the description of the Philippines and the whole battle of the Pacific very interesting because rather alien to my experience (as a European, I do tend to focus on the European war when thinking about this era and the Japanese side tends to be dismissed somewhat as a mere clean-up operation, so it is nice to put things into perspective).<br /><br />I am rather looking forward to reading the rest of the author's work. :-)

B00D6DVSAE|5.0|This is a brilliant piece of work. I believe this to be Stings best solo LP since Dream of the Blue Turtles. This is not put out to sell Cds--it is a work of art. It will find its audience and I am one..... this is no rehash of old {Police songs or any previous work-this is a wondeful collection of soulfull songs. inspired and IMO brilliant. PS> The track brian Johnson of AC/DC sings on is a perfect choice...you will heat what I mean :) Only possible complaint-is petty---Sting seems to use the word MOON or MOONLIGHT in at least two of these songs..he has already released the song SISTER MOON and MOON OVer Bourbon St....I think Sting has a MOON obsession :)
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Couldn't imagine how my collection of CD's survived without it.  And with it came the added bonus of listening to him on my laptop long before the CD arrived simply because I bought it.  Too cool!
B00DJZR46G|3.0|Elton John is a musical genius..there can be no argument on that. But his body of new work has not been all the great in recent years. His collaboration with Leon Russell was a departure and a very good album. But most of his work since THE ONE has been a rehash of other Elton songs. The Diving Board continues that trend. There are a few good songs on this album but most of the tracks remind me of BETTER, OLDER EJ tracks. I can break them down if you like-but he is just repeating and reconstructing many of his older songs...Ballad of Blind Tom=EGO reworked and Mona Lisas part 2 and a bit of runaway Train. My Quicksand-chorus is \\"breaking hearts\\" reworked at abput 2:50 There are also reused riffs from the big Picture and Songs from the est coast which both had similar sounding songs as well. The HIGHS of say BENNY and the lows of SORRY SEEMS TO BE..are gone--the songs are now one honogenous blend of snooze alarm. The best original and ethereal track  is the title track-Diving Board, an excellent and original piece of music. A true departure for Elton. Haven't heard one this rich since the days of Tumbleweed Connection. For that I am grateful but *I am tired of hearing him repeat song melodies. If you are a long time Elton fan you know his catalog of songs quite well. Sorry, I hear too many parts of other songs in this collection to go past three stars.
B00760BPOC|5.0|the whole series is great - how many characters that we are interested in will remain by the end of the series I wonder ????

B00112ASYO|4.0|I bought the Schleich crocodile to partner with my GI Joe Croc Master figure. Upon receiving it, I quickly bought another. This figure is extremely well detailed for its size, and with the positionable jaw is a must-have, particularly at this price. I have now begun looking at other Schleich figures, given the quality and affordability of this one. This is a very impressive croc, so much so that the one Croc Master came with was tossed in the garbage within minutes.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|Bought one for me and another for my friend and he likes it only problem is the screen went out on his soon after I gave it too him but seeing as we nevere look at the screen while playing it is no big deal love using it feels good and have been using it for over a year now still works great.

B00BEIYP8A|5.0|Those were director Ron Howard's words as he described the setting of his new film, RUSH - a fast-paced, colorful, energetic, adrenaline-filled, and excellently acted racing drama that some critics are are saying has \\"the greatest car racing scenes ever shot on film\\".<br /><br />Prepare to be surprised at [[ASIN:B0099RFVXQ Chris Hemsworth]]'s toughest and most meaty role yet - that of womanizing, fast-driving, fast-living British racer James Hunt. Hemsworth gives an entertaining and emotional performance, showing his range heretofore limited to smashing things with a hammer (which is still totally cool...). Accomplished young actor [[ASIN:B002YCVX5S Daniel Bruhl]] steals the scenes as the calculating, analytical, brilliant driver and Hunt's personal rival, Niki Lauda. Olivia Wilde and Natalie Dormer give quality performances, and like most of Ron Howard's resume, the film is excellently cast.<br /><br />The big focus here, though, is on the all-encompassing, deadly rivalry between Hunt and Lauda, which played itself out on race tracks all over the world. And guess what? The critics were right. In my opinion, it's *inarguable* that RUSH has some of the FINEST racing scenes ever shot. Filled with gut-clenching action and edgy cinematography, these set pieces are engrossing and fast-paced, and shot with a brilliant technical eye. Hans Zimmer's typically awesome score helps some, too. With clever camera tricks and brilliant editing, the audience is put right in the centre of the action - right in the cockpit of Hunt's Formula One race car. The noise is visceral and pulse-pounding, the driving is nail-bitingly tense, and the crashes are spectacular and terrifying. For added realism, Howard and his team used real cars for the races.<br /><br />Technically brilliant, RUSH is period-accurate (prepare for awkward hairdo's) - capturing that frenetic fervour of the 70's that made Formula One racing so popular. RUSH's cinematography is Howard's best since [[ASIN:B001JI72AI Apollo 13]], and the camerawork is stylish and kinetic, but the film is not without drama. The rivalry between Hunt and Lauda is emotionally played out with surprisingly excellent acting.<br />Cons? The plot isn't really as original as it might hope, and still succumbs to many common tropes of sports movies - the training montage, the television broadcast to keep us up to date, etc.<br /><br />But RUSH is a formula (pun intended) film running in top gear. Like a sports car, exterior is shiny and good to look at, though under the hood it is strong and well-oiled. The acting is surprisingly good, and Howard's typical technical brilliance and period accuracy is on full display here. RUSH should be a tremendously entertaining time at the movies, both for racing and car enthusiasts, and also for the casual viewer. This is a Formula 5 Star film!lo 13]], and the camerawork is stylish and kinetic, but the film is not without drama.

I had to wait 6 years for their album, but I love it. Get Wet is a mixture of House,Dubstep,Drumstep,Dutch and some other sub-genres. I highly recommend this album, you wont be disappointed!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|After having first watched the BBC documentary about this type of \\"fasting,\\" I decided to buy the Kindle version in case there was anything I had missed.  I do feel the book has additional information to offer and I'm glad I got it, although I'm vegan and the recipes weren't relevant for me.  (I do my own vegan version of the diet)<br /><br />Before getting the book I was just sort of winging it and not really making sure I was eating the exact amount of calories (which is 500 calories for a woman).  So I found I was neither losing nor gaining weight.<br /><br />After reading the book I decided to get with the real program and since then I have lost 10 pounds (went from 135 to 125 lbs. which was my target weight).  I am 53 years old and this diet seems to have really revved up my metabolism.  My BMI is now just a bit over 18% (I am 5'9\\") and this is where I feel most comfortable.<br /><br />What is interesting is it feels like I'm still losing weight even on my non-fast days~~which I guess it how it all works.<br /><br />On my fast days I drink black coffee in the morning, chew gum during the day, and save my calories for the evening (I try to go as long as possible without eating).  I typically have a bowl of Amy's organic lentil soup and then some steamed broccoli along with some raw cauliflower and carrots.  And that's it!  I do *not* wake up famished the next day and many days it will be noon or so before I get around to eating.<br /><br />I love taking a vacation from thinking about food two days per week and it has gotten easier the longer I do it.  It's nice to know you can eat whatever you want the next day (and still lose weight!) and that keeps me going.<br /><br />It's the best \\"diet\\" I've ever found and now that I'm at my goal weight I plan to do the fasting one day per week in order to maintain my weight (and reap some of the proclaimed benefits).  I'm getting my routine bloodwork back this week and I'm interested to see if it's any better (can't be *much* better because as a healthy vegan my numbers are already very good).<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend this diet and especially for older women whose bodies are determined to hold onto that last 10 pounds!  I feel so slim and energetic now~~

B005PK56TA|5.0|Very well rounded -- touch of humor, touch of terror, touch of the outlandish and so on. Actors were splendid.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought this little device so I could &#34;cast&#34; my Chrome browser tabs onto my TV screen from my tablet & phone (Transformer Infinity tablet).  Based on the documentation, casting Chrome tabs was one of the main selling points and it says it fully supports Android & Chrome.  However, what they don't mention is that you can only cast browser tabs from the &#34;desktop&#34; version of Chrome.<br /><br />There is currently no Chromecast extension for the mobile version of Chrome...  which basically means you can't cast Chrome tabs from your tablet or phone.<br /><br />From a desktop/laptop computer you CAN cast Chrome tabs (since this isn't the mobile version of Chrome).  This seemed to work good.  However, tablet casting was my main intention and in this category it's very limit (from tablet, you can only use Netflix, Youtube, and Google Play/Music.... that's it...)<br /><br />I guess I'll just have to wait until Chrome mobile support is added...

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Ok,  man muss zur sinnvollen Nutzung dieser App natuerlich zuerst einmal englisch koennen...<br />aber wenn das gewaehrleistet ist,  dann macht es richtig Spass und &quot;bringt auch was&quot;!<br />Ich habe es erst mal mit franzoesisch probiert,  das ich in der Schule gelernt habe.<br />Und. hey, es fiunktioniert schon mal prima!<br />Give it a try,  it's free!  :-)
B0044C5SCU|5.0|One of the best Sci-Fi shows after x-files. Always entertaining, great acting, riveting story-line. Never what you expect, never disappointing.  Now that the show is over I will miss Liv, Peter and Walter that is for sure
B0054R6BFM|5.0|That is how my daughter explained this book she had to read for school. It really peaked her interest as she thought.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|The book does what a guide should do: it tells you what to do and why you need to do it in clear, simple language. It's a quick read, and it's free, so make sure you read it if you want to self publish for kindle. That said, I am reviewing before using the book to create my first publication, so I can't vouch for how complete and accurate the simple instructions are.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|While this is a typical match 3 game, for those of us that enjoy the familiarity of a game for de-stressing, this game works.  The one glitch so far is the screen has a pause or freeze to it so the moves are not as smooth as they could or should be.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Started out great, 70 pages in, downhill from there. Just plain boring.<br />Timeline disjointed. Too many characters and not all tied into the plot. Confusing POVs. Narrative tiring.<br />If you enjoyed the author's two earlier works, stop there and keep fond memories of spectacular specimens of writing.<br />I was so tempted to not finish, the I thought that had I not finish, I didn't have the right to dislike it so much.<br />Awful. Hope people read reviews before investing time that will end up as &#34;anti-climatic&#34;.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Enjoyable series with deep character development. Worth the read even if you don't normally read in this genre.<br />Literary value as well.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The killer came out of nowhere<br />Not as medical as previous books. This was more personal<br />Next book hopes to be better
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Loved the book; great characters, plot and thought provoking issues. Complex relationships and the cruel reality of that time in history.  Our book club pick for October's discussion.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Overall very happy with this head set.<br /><br />Wireless range works well, able to go between several rooms with no interruption.<br /><br />Battery life is fine, never runs out during one session. Plug it in when done.<br /><br />Very comfortable to wear, it has a nice weight that seems to signify a fair amount of quality in the construction and material choice.<br /><br />extremely immersive by blocking out surrounding outside noise.<br /><br />Highly adjustable in just about every direction.<br /><br />Great quality on the mic.<br /><br />Software support is also superb.<br /><br />Controls on the left ear for setting marco keys, makes clicking through songs on Pandora easy.<br /><br />This is a really well thought out price point, and a great value.  I use this for gaming and audio, and everyday computer use.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|The humor in this film was marvelous! You won't see anything like this made anymore. Just wish it would have ended differently.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Amazing.  The kid from The Shining is all grown up and dealing with more monsters.  Stephen King just keeps getting better!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Never played a hidden object game like this before. The story is fun and the gameplay is pretty good. It does get a little frustrating at times because of the way you have fine things without any guidance or prior knowledge. However, that keeps you thinking. If you are a fan of hidden object games or just want to try something different, then this is the game for you. Good FAOTD. Played on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\"
B008D30K7E|5.0|I had heard great reviews and it lived up to them  all.  It had everything in it  ... good pieces of history , and the funny  side of theses historic  events  brought to the  surface ...Really  good read especially  for  some one who has lived through a few of these past events.  Would recommend it to everyone ... a really  great and funny  read

B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Sometimes a movie doesn't have to be exactly what the comic was like to be entertaining, and this movie hit all the marks. It showed the evolution and the eventual fall of iron man. Great movie!
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|Not worth watching. The original was much better than this  techie re make . In fact why doesn't Amazon offer the original  Judge Dred??
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have never read a book by Gillian Flynn and my daughter in law suggested that I read it when visiting.  It was hard to put down because you really did want to know what would happen next, and are usually surprised.  Plan to try another of author's books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So fun and exciting. My three year old loves it and yet my husband and play it too. Great game!
B00C6B9976|5.0|First off, great movie.  Now, about the blu ray + digital copy.  I opened the package and noticed the following on the card inside:<br /><br />Code that permits activation of Digital Copy may not be valid after 1/27/12<br /><br />However, when I redeemed it on iTunes today it was accepted.  Be aware of this when you get yours.  Hopefully it isn't expired.
B007X3DQGM|5.0|You can't beat Edie Eckman's crochet and she gives a lot of shapes and designs in this book. For those who love putting shapes together into a project like an Afghan, Shawl, Baby Blanket, Vest, etc. this book is fantastic. I use it often... Birdie Gee

B009NY43NY|5.0|It made sense.  It could have ended 20 different ways.  I loved it and shame on those who bash it because they don't like the ending.  I wanted her with Eric or Alcide but it wasn't my story to tell.  Sookie Queen of New Orleans - but that's my ending not Ms Harris ending.  I'll miss the series
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|addictive and entertaining, nice to see a well made game that doesn't require money to have fun with.  A great way to kill time!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|It said it installed correctly. When I try to run it all I get is a black screen with \\"Kindle\\" and a circle. After 2 seconds it closes.  Tried installing from both Google Apps and Amazon App Store. Tried uninstalling, reinstalling, and rebooting multiple times.  Even waited 2 months before trying a 5th, 6th, and 7th time. It must not work on Android 4.2.  Sure am glad the Barnes and Noble Nook app was a quick and clean install.

B00CMQX84A|5.0|LOVE IT.  CAME QUICK  RIGHT ON TIME FOR MY DAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY. VERY HAPPY WITH THE BOOK<br />THE CONDITION OF THE BOOK WAS AS STATED. NEW
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read the book knowing that it was  going to be better than the film, as most books with movie renditions are in the first place. What I was  not expecting was  for other  to be a whole different  ending in addition to elements to the book which were not in the film. It has all the characteristics of a good story: Romance, action, drama, adventure and humor. I will highly recommend it to anyone who has seen the movie an  enjoyed it, or just looking for a compelling next book to read. It reminds me of the Harry Potter books in the same way that both are easy to get drawn in and good for people who say they do not like reading. Although if you are looking for a challenging book, this is not it. More targeted towards the young adult/teen audience or the young at heart and mind. There was really nothing to dislike and everything to enjoy about  this book. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did. :-)

0735619670|5.0|This is the first time I ever write a review about anything. I've read plenty of good books but the fact that this one made me stop reading it to write this review says it all. If you area a software developer and truly want to become better at it please do yourself a favor and get this book. By the end, you'll have gained invaluable knowledge about how to design your system / classes / routines in a way that makes it almost effortless to maintain, improve, and add features to. It doesn't matter if you are a beginner, intermediate, or senior developer, I'm pretty sure you'll learn a lot from this book.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Why can't this guy be the standard for all medical doctors? I enjoy the fact that he points out idiocy in almost every episode and still manages to be likeable.
B008EEZ64Y|3.0|I read it because it was chosen by my book club.  Third part of an original trilogy that lets readers know there more in the series to be added. Readers are left with a &#34;tune in next week&#34; ending.  Felt the basic premise was far from fresh, and too predictable.  Writing style is easy to read and follow, which I liked. Author apprently got high marks from literary critics for this endeavor, but I am left wondering why.
B00CP4RZCU|5.0|Though I would much rather go to a show as listen to a live CD and imagine being there.  I gotta say this is one of the better song line ups that I have seen come from the BLS stage show front.  Overall it has a mellow Hangover Music feel to it and a great selection of songs from said disk (personally my favorite that he has done).  It does a good job of floating between a mellow, chill out vibe and kicking it up a bit with some s*** the really rocks.  But to anyone that really knows the earlier BLS stuff would truely appreciate is that the songs selected aren't all the radio killed stuff he's written.  This cd really did remind me how great his early music was...will definatley be on the ipod for a while.
B001BANK32|5.0|I read The Shining as a teenager and remember the joy of being scared at that age by a mere book.  I am re-reading The Shining in anticipation of reading the sequel Doctor Sleep and am so enjoying reconnecting with Stephen King as we both age.

1612191290|5.0|Really great book. It totally changed my entire perspective on money's role in the human condition. He puts together a strong argument, but even if you don't necessarily agree with him 100%, you will still learn a lot about different cultures throughout history- thanks to his anthropology background.
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|First let me say I LOVE Cher! 24 and own every vinyl and import compact disc. I collect 45s with rare tracks. I waited 12 years for this album and I'm not... just not what I expected.<br />I'm not a troll who bad mouths an artist out of immaturity like some. I LOVE the cover, and I'd have to say I love some tracks.<br />Take it Like a man. This song is Cher's song to gay men everywhere. One thing I felt about the album was that it sounded Too gay, and I'm a gay boy myself. I wanted this album to be mainsteam. Woman's world was Cher's attempt to recapture the Born This Way hit. It's cute don't get me wrong, Cher looks happy in the video :)<br />Hope you find it and Sirens are masterpieces! Sirens I keep replaying over and over.<br /><br />Lovers Forever, Walk Alone, And Scars just do nothing for me. I mean nothing. I dont ever hate songs, they just didnt strike me.<br /><br />Cher is aging I know. Shes led an amazing career and each record was gold! I am more a fan of her older 70's work. Believe, Not Commercial, Man's world, and Living Proof had so much various energies, great energy!<br />I think Cher Tried her very Hardest and it shows. There are good numbers on here.. I feel like this is her second \\"Cherished 1977\\". I was hoping for another iconic \\"Stars\\" masterpiece from 1975, but its still cher. It sounds so, not genuine. Cher never released an album to please a certain crowd, and she did with her gay fanbase. Thats really cool I think.  I'm happy I bought it tho and preordered the vinyl release. Its far from Cher's best, but it DOES have memorable songs I'll play for a llifetime<br /><br />Is it just me but doesnt Dressed to Kill sound like a combo of I PARALYZE and MUSICS NO GOOD WITHOUT YOU?
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great book from John Grisham...once again I couldn't put it down until I finished.  He continues to come out with quality work.
B00EEXST2K|4.0|There's not a lot to say about this movie that most of you don't already know, I would probably give this movie 3 stars where it not for Amanda Seyfried, she's young and beautiful, smart and really starting to find herself as an actor, sometime down the road I think she'll be considered one of the top actors of her time. She's very diverse in her ability to adapt to any role and not afraid to go where the role takes her, a true star on the rise.<br /><br />About the movie, you have to be patient as starts slow showing the early days of Linda as a teen, how she meant the people that took her down the wrong path in life (at least for her) and trying to show why she made some of the decisions that led her into porn. The characters aren't very well developed early in the film and lack depth, it's not until about the middle of film that things start to interesting and you begin feeling like you want to more and start getting more  involved, from there it just keeps getting better until at the end you feel like it needs to be maybe 15 minutes longer so you know more about Linda's life and how it went after the book came out.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Pro's:<br />+ Michael Fassbender's portayal of Magneto is excellent and compelling<br />+ covers the development of multiple characters (Charles Xavier, Mystique) with no filler<br />+ there are real stakes i.e. people die, get hurt badly, and get abandoned or betrayed<br />+ Kevin Bacon delivers an excellent performance as the villain<br />+ the mutants use their powers in novel ways<br />+ it respects the original material, including themes of equality, body image, teen love, and social acceptance<br />+ has a great ending<br /><br />Con's:<br />- Some special effects look terrible Example 1: the Beast looks like a short, blue, Cowardly Lion Example 2: A sea vessel is hurled ashore and when it hits some palm trees the trees look like they're from an old video game<br />- the character Havoc says only stupid things<br />- takes place in the swinging 60's, so some clothing or attitudes may look silly
B000JCSBU0|5.0|Reality check 101, it's not fun to watch but it keeps you glued to screen , when your done watching it you almost wish hadn't because it deals with content most of us could never imagine or understand in a frank and no holds bared way that puts the reality of it all right in your face, nothing glossed over her folks.<br /><br />It's all to easy to think this could never happen to me or my kids or my loved ones, watch this movie and you'll see how seemingly minor decisions one makes everyday in their life can lead you down a path of destruction to witch never return.
0385743564|5.0|The red star Calamity came, and suddenly a small number of people on Earth had superpowers. But they weren't superheroes -- they were tyrants.<br /><br />Let's face it: realistically, that is what would happen if people suddenly got DC/Marvel-style superpowers. The heroes of \\"Steelheart\\" are the little guys -- ordinary people determined to take down the cruel Epics -- and Brandon Sanderson crafts a fascinating sci-fi novel around the concept. It's a dark, harrowing tale about the corruption that power brings, and what happens when it's yanked away.<br /><br />Ten years, Calamity came -- and so did Steelheart, who conquered Chicago and made it his personal kingdom. Steelheart is invincible, super-strong, can control the elements, and his rage turns everything inorganic to steel. But ten years ago, someone made him bleed, so he killed everyone who had seen it. The only survivor is David, who devotes his life to studying the weaknesses of the Epics.<br /><br />Now the city (renamed Newcago) is ruled by Steelheart and locked in eternal night. David inadvertently bumbles into a sting by the Reckoners, a vigilante group out to kill Epics -- and finds it's a little harder to join theme than he thought it would be.<br /><br />The Reckoners reluctantly allow David to join, and use his extensive notes to plan out hits on the Epics who are loyal to Steelheart -- Nightwielder, Firefight, and Conflux. But the group is torn by fears about what killing Steelheart might cause -- and they don't have a prayer of killing him until they figure out his weakness. What's more, one of the Epics may be closer than they think.<br /><br />In a world where dictators and governments perpetrate unspeakable horrors, most people with incredible unstoppable superpowers would quickly be corrupted, or end up wussing out and serving someone who is corrupt. Yet in \\"Steelheart,\\" Sanderson reminds us that \\"You can't be so frightened of what might happen that you are unwilling to act\\" against tyranny.<br /><br />And he conveys this with gritty, muscular action scenes and a dry sense of humor (Cody's ramblings about Scotland), as well as a \\"Newcago\\" perpetually gripped by night, poverty and terror. The plot is pretty complicated, with the Reckoners relying on their sharp wits and ingenuity to attack the Epics -- and the Epics themselves are pretty well-drawn, with different gradations and types of powers.<br /><br />And Sanderson throws in some wickedly unpredictable twists as well, particularly the revelations about Steelheart himself. If there's a flaw in the plot, it's that one of the twists is a bit obvious -- you can tell that this character has a Deep Dark Secret in the woodworks. But the other twist is brilliantly unpredictable.<br /><br />David is an excellent hero, in the same mold as the \\"extraordinarily ordinary\\" heroes that Sanderson writes so well -- self-deprecating, eager, a little dorky, with some haunting scars from the loss of his father. And the Reckoners are given a pretty solid personalities -- Cody, who defuses fear with humor; the fierce Megan; and the quietly paternal Abraham.<br /><br />Whether it's a standalone or the start of a new series, \\"Steelheart\\" is a brilliant subversion of the superhero genre. Here, the superheroes are the little guys -- and their power is that they will never give in, despite their doubts./><br />And he conveys this with gritty, muscular action scenes and a dry sense of humor (Cody's ramblings about Scotland), as well as a \\"Newcago\\" perpetually gripped by night, poverty and terror.

031623480X|5.0|I expected that \\"Grain Brain\\" would just be an explanation of the benefits of eating wheat/gluten free. For the past five years, that is how I have changed my diet, with extraordinary improvement in the MS exacerbations that I have had for 21 years. But, this book is about so very much MORE. Dr Permutter, both a neurologist and nutritionist, clearly explains the dangers of high carbohydate eating. Those dangers should be of interest to everyone.<br /><br />Since I read the book last week, I have totally changed the way that I eat.  I have lost over 3\\" on my waistline in that week, something that I have been unable to do for over a year with even very low calorie eating . Yes, that's only a cosmetic improvement. But, like the gluten-free eating of the past few years, there must be additional and IMPORTANT things going on in my body with this kind of eating.<br /><br />Several of my best friends, about whom I care a great deal, have already received copies of this book from me. It is incredibly interesting and written in a way that explains things at a level comfortably between organic chemistry and the usual health book's condescending tone of, \\"It's too complicated for you. Let's just say 'it happens.\\"<br /><br />\\"Grain Brain\\" could and SHOULD change the way Americans eat.

B00DCRE7M0|5.0|This is Labrie's best work to date! I actually prefer his solo work, especially this album, to DT. Every song on this album has a MONSTER-radioish sing-a-long-arena rock chorus. When the hooks come in, you can hear and feel the emotion in James's voice and it makes you want to start singing loud along with him. Buy this CD you won't regret it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very thought provoking, though shorter than I expected. The author's theories and conclusions make me want to do more independent reading.
B00E95ED32|5.0|If somebody would've told me a year ago that Avicii makes different kind of music other than progressive house, I would've mocked them. Not so anymore. This album is a great surprise for me as an Electronica fan. Evidently, the artist took time to create a melange of different kinds of music along with typical Swedish House beats. Songs such as \\"Wake Me Up\\", \\"Hey Brother\\" or \\"Lay Me Down\\" are products of influence that country and disco music holds in artist's mind. So let's break it down track-by-track.<br />1. \\"Wake Me Up\\" - album's hit. Nothing much to add. Starts with guitar sounds and slowly progresses to the climax.<br />2. \\"You Make Me\\" - bass and piano. Kind of indie.<br />3. \\"Hey Brother\\" - very country-like song. Similar in style with the first track.<br />4. \\"Addicted to You\\" - sung by Audra Mae. Song goes by without any major breaks or progressions.<br />5. \\"Dear Boy\\" - If you liked \\"I Could Be The One\\" by Avicii vs. Nicky Romero, you'll like it too, since it's very similar.<br />6. \\"Liar Liar\\" - nothing like Avicii at all. Very chilled version comparing to \\"Tomorrowland Version\\", so if you expect major breaks and bass attack, that's not it.<br />7. \\"Shame on Me\\" - back to his style. Starts with percussion and slowly prepares you for whatever-big-is-coming.<br />8. \\"Lay Me Down\\" - disco is back in town. I was surprised to hear this song mixed with house-like beats, yet to realize it's still disco.<br />9. \\"Hope There's Someone\\" - you have to wait long before this song really reveals itself. Very beautifully sung by Linea Henriksson.<br />10. \\"Heart Upon My Sleeve\\" - another song that keeps switching from country to orchestra-like music, yet without lyrics, which makes it the only song that has no lyrics in this album.<br /><br />Avicii does indeed revolutionizes EDM by bringing back and adding different genres of music. In short, he shows the impossible being done. This album testifies that he's not a prisoner to his own style and he is willing to take risks to create something so much greater. For that, Avicii deserves to be respected.
4893581198|5.0|Fast and prompt service.. I would recommend this book to someone.<br /> The logic behind many concepts are shown in cartoons, pictures, and presentations. I would say this book, in many aspects, is descriptive.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  As someone who works in the mental health field, I found the main character's situation believable and compelling, and realistic.  Also, the added flowers angle made it more interesting.  Her struggles and achievements were engaging.  Definitely worth the read!
B00633PFQC|5.0|A study group of four of us selected this book for an in-depth conversation.  It made us realize how much of our social interaction has been reduced economic like activity, devoid of moral and ethical activity.  We were left questioning, how do we change this.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This is such a good story.  Told in a simple way, with very complex undertones this one delivers on all counts.  Short, I read it in a sitting, but long enough that it had everything i would want it to have.  And, as always, Sanderson's magic system was sick.
B002U3CCF6|5.0|Definitely a book I didn't want to put down.  A very disturbing and dark tale . Could not find anything endearing about any of the main characters.

0061906220|5.0|My son loves this book and requests it often.  He really likes the repetition and the song Pete sings; he often recites the story to himself as he looks at the pictures and likes to chime in while I read it aloud.  We've gone to the website listed in the book several times to listen to the author read and sing.  The artwork is bright, creative, and interesting.  The message about staying positive and optimistic when life throws you curve balls is great for young kids -- they often have little control over things that happen to them, but total control over how they respond.  I can see why this book is such a hit -- I really enjoy reading/singing it too!

B007SGLZP8|2.0|I listened to this book on CD and about half way through I thought maybe I missed a chapter or two. I had an inkling of where the author was heading, and just kept listening to see if I was right, and yup that is exactly where the story led. Even though this is fiction, just for entertainment, this is a very very farfetched and disjointed tale, with the protaganist going to such lengths to reach his goal. It was almost as though it was put together by different authors.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I love love love Alabama Shakes her CD is rocking!!I sing out loud going down the highway only when I am alone though!!This is talent I hope she comes near Erie PA So I can see them LIVE!
0762445262|5.0|Gave this to my nephew for his birthday. He loves it. It's on the small side but it lights up just fine. Decent price too!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Wonderful book.  One of best five I have ever read.  Very hard to put it down.  Excellent writing and editing.  Learned about a part of WW II I never knew about in France.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|After struggling with it for many weeks I finally give up.  The kindle fire doesn't charge. Big disappointment.  Don't buy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were my escape from the stress of a college student's life.. I wasn't able to put them down, every spare moment was dedicated to getting lost in them. The word &#34;brilliant&#34; doesn't do justice in describing these books. They were amazing!
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I remember how White Pony made me feel about the one and irreplaceable Deftones. When i was in school... Im a bit older now and less into music hunting until of recent, since i got the time. I still regret not visiting them on June 5 in Corpus a while back since that is my bday. As i write this, is the date of first listening to Koi No Yokan. I have heard all of Deftones and this is miles ahead imho. It is like being born again or falling in love again to something that appeals to oneself. I remember listening to their beginnings and then White Pony emerged and that was \\"it\\". And thats how i feel about this album. Koi No Yokan. It has that \\"it\\" resonance for me. Between White Pony and Koi No Yokan is a tough choice since i rely on \\"Elite\\" and \\"Korea\\" from White Pony, only when ive tapped into my reserves and have minimal left. But for now, Koi is my number one vibe at the moment.
0061367036|5.0|Bought it for a friend for her birthday. She is a total Supernatural nut and she LOVES it! It is full of fun info.  :)
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|**NOTE** When i reviewed this originally i was so blown away by Disc 1 and Disc 2 i didn't bother checking out Disc 3 or the DVD assuming they'd be up to the same standards... They're not, 'Live and Loud' was mastered by Bob Ludwig to the same standards of his 2011 Nevermind remaster. I can't believe DGC wouldn't just let Steve Rooke do the entire package. Yet again Bob Ludwig looks like a hypocrite because Steve Rooke has turned in a quality remaster of 'In Utero', it's b-sides and demo's -- the main selling point from a mainstream perspective (the stand alone album and deluxe edition seem to be everywhere). whilst Bob Ludwig has compressed the hell out of a concert that appeals more to diehard fans who cough up the cash for this Super Deluxe release. So one more time for old time sake, the most hypocritical of all quotes...<br /><br />\\"People talk about downloads hurting record sales, I and some other people would submit that another thing that is hurting record sales these days is the fact that they are so compressed that the ear just gets tired of it. When you're through listening to a whole album of this highly compressed music, your ear is fatigued. You may have enjoyed the music but you don't really feel like going back and listening to it again. It's been really rough, folks, But it can get better and I think it will get better. I'm glad it's going to be over.\\"<br /><br />--<br /><br />After the atrocity that was 2011's Nevermind re-issue/re-master which suffered from horrendous loudness war mastering i was skeptical about this re-release of my favourite Nirvana album 'In Utero'. It felt like history repeating itself and another cash grab.<br /><br />Luckily, the complaints about the re-master of Nevermind don't seem to have fallen on deaf ears.<br /><br />\\"On the remastering of In Utero by Steve Rooke:<br /><br />The original mix and the 2013 remix versions were mixed down to 30ips half inch non-Dolby analogue tape, Steve Albini's preferred format.<br /><br/>When mastering the CD & Digital versions the masters were played from a Studer analogue machine into the EMI TG analogue transfer desk.<br /><br />All EQ'ing etc was done using the TG desk and when we had the desired sound the tracks were transferred via a Benchmark A to D converter onto our Sadie workstation.<br /><br />Once on the workstation the tracks were listened to and any unwanted artifacts removed. Any clicks such as plectrum noises and guitar switch noises, etc. were left in as these were felt to be part of the performance.<br /><br />The final stage of the mastering process for the digital formats was to play the albums through a real time digital limiter to increase volume level.<br /><br />As we wanted to keep as much dynamic as possible the limiting was minimal as we felt the album would suffer if heavily limited.\\"<br /><br />'In Utero' still sounds LOUD but that's because the band played loud. Dave Grohl slayed the drums, Krist pummelled the bass and Kurt screamed and played guitar with vicious energy. This is a step in the right direction for Nirvana releases, if only 'With the Lights Out' and the 'Nevermind' re-master were given the same attention to detail.
B0034KZE9U|3.0|These are a whole lot more comfortable than the Tredsafe clogs sold at Walmart, but the non-slip/oil resistant feature claimed by crocs is a crock (of s***). I nearly busted a*s as soon as I stepped foot into the kitchen. I usually wear 11s but these are way too big, so buy a pair a size smaller. Fortunately the little strap on the back keeps them from falling off even if they are a bit large.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.  To find out that the author went WAY back in time to find out that this was true is amazing to me.  It makes you  stop and think about the way things were and how dreadful it had to be.<br /><br />AWESOME READ!!!!!!
B002GYI9C4|4.0|This guy did a great job finishing the wheel of time, here he is in his own element and world and even better.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|wHAT A GOOD BOOK AND WHAST A SURPRISE.  yOU HAVE TO KNOW A BOOK IS GOOD WHEN YOU GASP WHEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT THE SECRET REALLY IS.  RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ONE AND ALL.
1250029465|4.0|Was very inspiring as I have a son who followed the same life path for many years. I would highly recommend it not only to those who have lived this life but to their family as well.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|If you don't mind a lot (and I mean A LOT) popups for in-app-purchases and sometimes laggy controls, it's a great alternative for Temple run. Really captures the humor and atmosphere of the movie.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Exceeded expectations, like the quality of it. As I hate third party controllers, this one's quality is just outstanding! Excellent response times, good design, extremely durable, stylish color, and that cord that is longer than the original one (9.8 ft)!<br /><br />Worth the money!<br /><br />Recommended
1476727651|4.0|I have to be honest a initially approached this book reluctantly.... I thought it was going to be a simple sequel (i.e Shinning Part 2 ). But what I found was something much more interesting. If you approach this book looking for the sweet boy you read years ago, forget about it.... you will not find him here, he has changed like many of us. But Danny continues to be a compelling character on its own, despite everything you will root for him.<br />PLEASE DO NOT BE DISCOURAGE FOR REVIEWS THAT COME FROM PEOPLE THAT READ ONLY ONE CHAPTER.... give this book a chance, you will not regret it.
B00CUKTG2Q|5.0|i was really of the belief that franz were done, alex was producing, new side projects were more than hinted at and now here comes this, absolutely their finest work.  period.  every song pulsates with the now signature franz sound, the lyrics are direct, literal, oftentimes hilarious, the multitude of ptoducers, usually a sign of worry--it all works here to great pop rock effect.  \\"evil eye\\", the current single (and my personal favourite...), \\"right action\\", and of course, \\"goodbye lovers and friends\\" are all standouts among standouts.  oh, and spend the extra coins for the deluxe edition.  13 fab songs recorded LIVE at konk! studios, among them tons of stuff from 'right...' (of course...), but also an amazing franz/donna summer cover of \\"can't stop feeling\\", \\"do you want to\\" and the classic \\"ulyses\\" (sic?).  this is definitely one of the albums of 2013, along with arctic monkeys, chvrches, the national and suede.  whoo, they came through in spades.
B008RKGF1I|3.0|Seriously, very poor acting. However, there was some great music from the 80's. I saw this when I was younger and thought it was better, I must have matured in my viewing of movies.
B00E6895M6|5.0|let's set the scene.  indie band frorm glasgow, scotland wants to make it big.  they self-release four singles, only going back and tweaking one for the album proper.  a and r buffoon by demand kept at arm's length by band in order to preserve 'goal' of record.  hasn't worked in the pastl.......BUT IT WORKS NOW!!!!!  'the bones of what you believe' calls to mind 4ad's purity ring without the cocteauish song titles and less enigmatic.  \\"the mother we share\\" is the most brilliant single of the year, and \\"gun\\" isn't bad either.  hmmmmmm......sometimes shaky situations work out for all concerned.  buy this album.  10/10.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|I absolutely love this movie that carries over from the first movie and the TV series.  Waiting for the girls next adventure.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book was like coming home.. Finally KNOWING what happened with little Danny Torrence and his mother after the traumatic(yet satisfying)ending of The Shining was fulfilling to say the least! If you're a die-hard King fan I shouldn't have to tell you to read this book. If you're a newbie, prepare to lose yourself! But I'd recommend you start with The Shining first of course ;)
1594744475|5.0|This is a great book for the beginning bento enthusiast. It breaks down everything and give you reasons behind the creations as well as the health benefits. I found this book very insightful. the pictures wonderful and the tips very helpful. I found this book a big plus in the fact that it can be applied to people living in the US in all different locations. Some books have a lot of recipes requiring Japanese ingredients that are not easily found in the grocery store.  This book does not have a difficult grocery list and definitely inspires creativity and adaptation.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I like that this story was not too convoluted, and that there were quiet moments interspersed with the action sequences.
B00021HBGS|4.0|This is a great bath toy.  The pieces are colorful and there are plenty of them! The mesh bag is sturdy and has suction cups to stick to the bathtub wall. Different types of vehicles like trains, motorcycles, trucks, buses, dump trucks, and train track pieces.  I would recommend this product, its great and a good value.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|Wow! Absolutely great game. I liked to play these kind of games on my PC and now there is finally an app of the same quality and length. I will play this a lot!
B00009NQQO|2.0|The netting on the hoop loosened and is coming off on one side and the balls are just ok.  I thought that maybe since it is a bath toy that there would be no holes in them to let water inside.  Every time my son would squeeze a ball black gunk would come out.  I threw away the entire set, waste of money. Would have given a better rating if it weren't for the balls that allow water to sit stagnate and get moldy.
B003GR90E6|5.0|These sandals were purchased for my father. They are his second pair of Newports. He finds them very comfortable and wears them all of the time to work in the yard or go to dinner. His feet run warm so he likes the ventilation and especially the toe protection and how well the rocks stay out when doing yard work. The durability and versatility make the Keen Newports a must have shoe. In fact yesterday I purchased him a third pair, the Newport H2 to try.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Easy to use, mildly addicting for anyone with a more than casual affinity for horses. Great for all ages! Definitely recommend
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|This album is amazing. Every song rocks. This is definitely one of those albums you play over and over. Love it!
B00E0SX118|5.0|this movie is so full of color and it's just a really good family film.  my daughter is so into princess movies and it was a good change to hear her say that she wanted to be just like eep and that she thought she was beautiful.  love this movie!
B001P8B8R0|5.0|My daughter is addicted to the Schleich line of animals.  And just liek all the rest, this product holds up to the name.  Very durable & the most natural looking you will find.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I like Iron Man anyway, but the rest of the guys are sooo cute - eye candy. It is a good movie to watch when t.v. has nothing else on.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love, love, love!!! I am so happy that this game is out!! I can't stop playing this game!! Love it!!!
B0011EU0NG|5.0|I just saw this for the first time.  I can't believe I never saw it.  It is just great: full of color, imagination, fantasy, a fun story line, great props and sets, location filming in England and France.  Just delightful!  I enjoyed every second of it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love texting my friends and family!! An  starring what I love!! It's like I'm in another world ..... Haha
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Purchased this for my daughter and she loves it, plays it all the time and would recommend it highly!! great
B00280LYIM|5.0|I loved it sooooooo much<br /><br />I especially love the part where annabeth kisses percy for good luck and how she  always snapped and Rachel Elizabeth dare
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Loved the characters and the way the story wove a web that tied them all together through so many years and countries.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Let me preface this comment with the fact that I LOVE Stephen King, and have read EVERYTHING he's ever written about 100x a piece, I'd happily read his grocery list, staying up over night to do so, BUT, and it's probably just me, this novel read like an advertisement for AA. I really loved \\"Dark Danny\\" in the beginning, the early chapters got me excited, thinking, \\"here we go\\" which made the letdown of the later chapters that much more difficult to deal with. AA fixed everything. I don't want to give too much away, if you're a Kingafile, get it. Form your own opinions. Mine? This one will not get the rereadings that my other King books get, I also felt a heavy Joe Hill influence.<br />One thing I did notice, the King pic at the end of the Kindle? page forward and back, forward and back...it looks like there's a creepy hand on his head, and no I'm not drunk.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|Already have a Withings scale which we're very happy with and so was very excited to try the Pulse.<br /><br />Initial experience was great but by accident the unit was damaged in way that it should have been built to survive. This device is not robust enough to be an activity tracker.<br /><br />Customer Service offered a replacement unit at 70% of the purchase price. My view is that this is far too high.<br /><br />Given its fragility and the high replacement cost, I wouldn't recommend entering into a relationship which will probably cost hundreds to maintain over time.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I made it to chapter 8. Somewhere this type book about more than one family in more than one situation is exhausting to read. It has nothing in it to want to \\"get back to it\\"... I see all the positive reviews and said , should I give it another try? The answer was \\"NO\\". Sorry could just about hit one star. But realized the author did put effort in to it. Must have been exhausting for her to keep referring to her outline seeing where she was? I could not figure it out. Better luck next book!
B008JFUR10|5.0|Pacific Rim was intensely action oriented.  It had alot of action, staff fights, killer swords, carnage and destruction on land and in the ocean of the monsters, and a small amount of romance.  The movie seem military oriented, but had Godzilla like monster clashes in the city.  The movie was very immersive and the simulation pulled you into the destruction of nuclear war, the fear of the monster, and the chase of the giant.  The monsters reminded me the the cragon of Clash of the Titans and Pirates of Caribbean.<br /><br />The moral of the story is \\"men have to die\\" to stop the clock of war.  The story line supports the idea that soldiers fight to avenge the death of their loved ones.<br /><br />The movie has humor.  The wackie scientists that mind link with the spider eyed aliens discover that earth is going to be invaded: dinosaurs, global warming, and co2 open the way for an earth without humans; a laughable idea mocking the anti-human philosophy.
B002NT3B52|4.0|The main purpose is to explore the \\"umwelt\\" of a dog - how a dog experiences its life, and to help humans see that.<br /><br />The book is lighthearted in general and Horowitz clearly loves dogs. The book is filled with anecdotes from her dogs. I am not qualified to judge the science but there was nothing that shouted out, and for the non scientist it is a good introduction into dog cognition.<br /><br />One problem - she is too dismissive of training - she rightly, in my opinion, disapproves of some common training tactics - but there are many trainers who would agree with her.<br /><br />Most dog owners should enjoy this book.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Connecting the Chromecast with my home network caused my computer to crash repeatedly.  After a bit of experimentation I identified Chromecast as the problem. When I removed Chromecast the problem was gone.  To solve the problem I had to remove Chromecast and then uninstall and reinstall my Microsoft Security Essentials software.  The problem is resolved now.  Despite this issue, the Chromecast functionality actually did work - I'm returning it because it's just not worth it to me to have to troubleshoot these issues and figure out how I can make it work without crashing my computer.
B009K916ZK|5.0|Does what it's supposed to.  Don't let friends tell you they can tell a difference between this and hdmi/dvi connections.  Works great on my TV at 1080p.  Just as clear as a full digital connection.  Good stuff and high quality from Apple.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I know I am only 12 years old but this book is like a smack I'm the face. It snaps you back to reality. I was totally in tears by the end of this book. This is truly the best book I have ever read. You need to read it.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This movie is amazing.  Just watch it.  My girlfriend told me I'd love it and I do!  I never wanted to pull out my phone or do anything but keep my eyes glued to the screen.
B008XOXGCO|5.0|Love these guys, have all of their music.  Great addition to my growing CD collection.  Enjoying listening to it on my ipod
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Amazing book ten stars if i could give it that many, i highly recommend this book to people in small book clubs
B00BWWS81S|5.0|I have loved KT Tunstall since I first heard Black horse in a Cherry Tree.  She has so much talent and I love anything that she is willing to sing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wonderful book! Def kept me interested the whole time. Would recommend to all of my friends to read!  Can't wait to read the next one
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|I have enjoyed Sheryl's music since she first popped onto the music scene in the early 90s.  This goes back to her country roots. Great Cd.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I thought it was a very good short book. More people should know the great visionary that Tesla was. He does not get enough credit for all his ideas.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this entire series. These books are so good you won't be able to put them down. A must read.
B00DJ80VMM|3.0|What i love about dream theater is their complex music that takes many twists and turns throughout a song. This album seems ...bland...and linear. No instrumedleys here. I am not gonna go into that Portnoy Manginy bs, because i loved &#34;a dramatic turn of events&#34;, and i have a lot of respect for both drummers.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|In my top 5 of favorite shows that never seems to get old.
078322933X|5.0|WOW for Mark Wahlberg ... this one really grabbed my attention and kept me hanging on. Strong characters, great story ... a great thriller.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|definitely one of my top 5 tv shows and books series. i would recommend this show to  anybody.  .  .
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I've loved all of the seasons of SOA and season four does NOT disappoint! Always a great ride with this cast/crew and Sutter constantly keeps me guessing. Highly recommend all seasons.
B007UWBQEU|4.0|Enjoyed watching it at home since I've never been able to go see her in concert. We love Carrie Underwood
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This book is by far one of the best books I've ever read. Now that I am readimg it through for the third time, I realize that it is also a book that will never get old. Definitely worth a read.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Everything I could want in a Sailor Moon figure. Easy to adjust, with lots and lots of accessories. Very easy to recreate almost any Classic Sailor Moon pose. A MUST for any Sailor Moon merchandise or figure collector!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Oh my goodness. This story is so heartbreaking in so many ways. I don't think I've cried so much from a book before. Definitely one of my favorites. Why I have not read any of Colleen Hoover's books before now, I can't say, but I'm definitely reading her other works, starting with Losing Hope, then Slammed.  Read Hopeless if you haven't already!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I use google on all of my devices. It is without a doubt my go to seach engine. This app is simple to use and gets the info I need quickly.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|Vienna Opera House is a wonderful venue, the audience enthusiastically responsive, and the Bonomassa performance made it complete. Prima gut!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This is a simply and easy notepad app. Simple to use, easy to read graphics. This is a great addition to my kindle!
0810993139|5.0|The kids I read with as a volunteer love this series.  Some of the &#34;American&#34; humor and idioms will not register with non-English speakers, but they seem to enjoy the book any way and they will pick up some &#34;American&#34; humor subtleties if you explain to them what the author is trying to say.
B004SDEP38|5.0|This is a very helpful! This is the only way I can keep all my devices in sync and get all my documents whenever I need them!
0744014956|5.0|Made a great gift for my brother in law, to go with his new game. It really is a nice looking book, and the print was pretty cool. I think this will last longer then those flimsy paper back ones he has for the other GTA games that are all shredded.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Liked where this story was going but it ended really goofy..i really love Stephen King's writing, just been disappointed in the way some of his stories have ended lately ;(
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was entertaining and kept me guessing until the end. Well written and unusual. Have recommended it to friends.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|I am dissappointed that the first season does not start with either of the pilot epidodes and does not follow the encyclopedia episode numberring.
1416595236|5.0|Now that Vince has passed I will miss his books and his Mitch Rapp hero...Thank Vince for good read  R.I.P
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Compact size. Fits snug in car charging port so I don't have to worry about it sliding out and not charging my device. Does it's job and can charge an apple and android device at the same time while the devices are actively in use.
B005544TRQ|5.0|these two hot hunks are a dynamic duo in this series, it's a drama but thru make me laugh!! I highly reccomend!!!
B001BP3Z9G|1.0|The product could not be viewed on my DVD player. It was a total waste of money. It should be noted when a product can only be viewed on particular electronics.
B00EDPFJA4|4.0|this is a great album however there is some flaws.  like some of the songs do sound the same.. And it would of been the best album of tthe year if Drake stayed with rapping and not this R&B thing he does.. Gkmc seems like it's untouched on the best album of the year... other than that a great album..
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Game is very enjoyable but it would be better if it did not cost so much it would be nice if once in awhile these big game companies thought of our mostly empty pockets instead of their over flowing one's.
B00F8L2VO4|2.0|as someone else mentioned, you get to the end of lesson 1 and the 'continue' button is grayed out so you can't do anything but quit, which loses your progress. great app besides that part which makes it useless.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|this is fun. a little frustrating at times but that's good. keep them coming. can't wait for the next Angry Birds game.
B000B5OD4I|5.0|I got the 007 to complement my Seiko Black Monster.  The Black Monster is a great when you are actually diving, but lacks a certain amount of class for more formal occasions.  The 007 doesn't have this problem.  It looks good.  Period.  It is a classic design that has and will age well.  There are other divers that may look better, but servicing them costs more than this watch costs to buy.  If you are an accuracy freak then you either need to spend 10X what this watch costs or get a quartz.  It doesn't bother me: my Monster (same automatic movement) keeps decent time and if you are underwater for 50 minutes at a time, having a watch that runs 5-30 seconds a day fast isn't a deal breaker.  Respect an inexpensive automatic movement's limitations and its charms will grow on you.  I find the bezel easy to turn and great for roughly timing things at work.  Negatives?  The lume is dimmer than my Monster's and the Jubilee bracelet has folded links, but these are negatives relative to my Monster which has freakishly bright lume and a bracelet of solid stainless steel.  If you search online you will find people rarely leave the jubilee on and instead use a Bond nylon strap or Isofrane rubber strap, but I like mine just the way it is.  Is it perfect? No.  Does anything else for $200 come closer? Not in my humble opinion.  I will wear my 007 until it breaks...and then buy another.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Once you get over the price, this is much better than the charger this headset comes with which was horrible.  This charger is a great place to put the Voyager when not using it.  But also adds the universal USB charging plug which is the same as my Samsung phone so car charger works for both.  It is strong and fairly waterproof at least in terms of rain.  It took a while to get used to folding headset to put in case but I got used to this quickly.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This is a very good game for those of you who love being wacky and creative. Though it has a tendency to take things literally, like a genie. For example, say game boy and there is a boy playing a video game, not a game boy advance. But don't let that discourage you. It's just a few bumps in the road. I got this for my kindle before reading the reviews that it &quot;didn't work on the kindle&quot; but maybe theirs was just a little buggy. It could happen to anyone, right? But be prepared to spend 1.98 because they do charge you twice to unlock all the levels.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved everything. It didn't leave you hanging at the end. It answered all my questions I had. Wish the were even more Skokie Stackhouse novels.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|Spoiler alert.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson has written some of my favorite books. I love Way of Kings (one of my favorites, along with Watership down). Love the first 3 mistborn (although Wax and Wayne could disappear and never be missed. Ever).<br /><br />I am disappointed by this book.  Not VERY disappointed, but disappointed nonetheless. It felt A LOT like mistborn, the final empire mixed with Alcatraz; both of which I enjoy very much separately but don't seem to go down so well together.<br /><br />The only POSSIBLE way that I could like David as a Character is if he is an Epic. And he isn't. So his cool under fire, crack shot, master improviser skills don't make sense.<br /><br />You don't profess love while under heavy fire. You don't quip while riding at high speeds firing guns. You don't...whatever.<br /><br />So, the characters were not that exciting, the plot twists were somewhat predictable if you have read his other works (although how to kill steelheart is a good and original one).<br /><br />The other characters were also familiar. We have Sazed. We have Kelsier. We have Alcatraz for goodness sake (sans awesome power, so his clueless actions under fire don't seem so legit). Even I think that Ham can bee seen in the one guy....I literally finished reading this book 10 minutes ago and I can't remember his name. The Scottish southern guy who seems to be unaware that Y'all is PLURAL, not singular. I mean, if you are going to characterize someone as from the south, get an editor that has heard someone speak with a southern accent and/or colloquialism. Once.<br /><br />Well, I am being a little hard on Brandon. Maybe I am just mad because he should be working in Roshar (see, haven't read that in months and I can remember...ah Dalinar. Wherfore art thou Kaladin?) Okay, I spell checked the names on google. But I did remember them on my own. Really!<br /><br />All told, I paid the kindle price (what's up with the favoritism with hard covers?) and have paid more and better money to go to some hateful hollwywood brain rotter, so all told I consider it money not bitterly spent. I will get Firefight too! From the library :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A wonderful book about real teenagers dealing with life threatening illness with humour and intelligence.  I have read this book twice and loved it both times.
B00AHG9KYE|3.0|This book really doesn't have a lot of substance in that I suppose it is like the rest of the series.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Like Red Riding Hood this Story book version was much better then I anticipated<br />a good thought out story .. GREAT caste.. clearly filmed and good sound<br />will entertain and keep your interest
B0069JBKHI|5.0|This is our second baby monitor and my wife and I just love it.<br /><br />It set itself up almost effortlessly and with their app download from the apple app store, easily synced with both of our iPhones and iPads and allowed for viewing the feed whether we were connected through our local LAN or over the internet. We love that it shows temperature and humidity, and that we can pop on my sons favorite lullaby right from the app. With Withings new web based viewing, its encouraging to know that they view this as an active product and are continuing to make it better and more feature rich.<br /><br />The one annoying feature is that it detects significant changes in light levels as movement in the room, and sends annoyingly loud notifications to all of our connected devices even when there is no one in the room.<br /><br />Also, we have mounted the camera to the wall over my sons crib, but as it plugs into an electrical outlet, my son loves to try and reach through the bars and pull on the wires, dislodging the camera. We have had to move his crib away from the wall to protect the camera wires from his playing/chewing.<br /><br />Overall we love this product and would recommend it to any parent looking for a great monitoring solution for their child.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Even if you have watched Wizard of Oz all your life. OZ is not one to miss<br />it is a great tribute to the classic original.  Expect great cast with talent<br />and a good well thought story line., tribute to the original move well done
B004SBULWE|3.0|When I had my android phone this worked wonders. I really can not tell if this is working on my kindle fire. This app is always telling me some apps are on. And I know there not. I'm just not so sure about it anymore.
B0016JBCJW|5.0|Wes Anderson. That's all I can say. He does it every time. There was a short pre-film titled, Hotel Chevalier, which gives a little more info about Jason Schwarzman's character drama with an ex girlfriend. I recommend finding that somewhere on the internet and watching it before you dive into Darjeeling Limited.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Okay, I'll admit it...this book totally creeped me out. I need puppy kisses, and warm chocolate chip cookies, and some Disney characters to make me feel \\"right\\" again.<br /><br />This is a book I wished I'd not read. Not because it isn't well written and interesting and page turning, but because I feel a little damaged after reading it.<br /><br />The characters in Sharp Objects are almost all broken. The few that aren't don't really show up very often so they can offer no balance to all the bad going on.<br /><br />I see no redemption or any happy endings for the characters. To me, they are beyond help. That's what makes me the saddest. I just can't envision anything better for them.
B00466HNHM|5.0|Excellent movie.  I bought this for myself and a copy for my sons girlfriend who had never seen it. She loved it to. Whitney Houston at her best!
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app is giving me error messages and won't let me log in on my kindle. I have tried everything and nothing seems to work &gt;:(
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|You should watch this movie.  I won't claim that it's the best action flick in the world, but it's really fun to watch.  Karl Urban does a great job and the director stayed truer to the comic.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game for all ages. My daughter loves solving the puzzles. There should be more games like this that make you use problem solving skills.
0321701763|4.0|I really like this series. But sometimes you forget what you've learned. It does a really good job of walking you through various situations but it doesn't really explain why you were doing some of the things it says. I wish it explained more and also did more examples from previous chapters. On although it is a really good book great for beginners
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a good, fast paced, Mitch Rapp novel.  It ended kind of abruptly, I thought, but still, I Recommend.
B00FFVML74|4.0|The problem with all murder mysteries is once you find out \\"who done it\\" you are in danger of being bored by the ending.  This show manages to suck you in enough to jerk a tear or two out of you after it finally lets you know what really happened to the victim, who the improbable killer is, and what motivated him to kill.<br /><br />I would say the tone and the acting was great.  These BBC shows (Doc Martin, Kingdom, etc.) are so great at giving you multiple reasons to become entranced.  The towns are incredible to look at.  The people are unvarnished and complex.  The protagonists are not terribly stereotypical.<br /><br />BBC seems able to convey pathos in these series; American television is less at home with this emotion.  We want to laugh more and be \\"entertained.\\" The UK's sensibility is a bit more nuanced and conveys a wider range of emotions, including darker ones.<br /><br />I'll link this quality to the interviews I've seen of British actors doing promotion in the US -- one was asked \\"how are you?\\" and reflexively answered \\"great!\\" \\"amazing!\\" \\"couldn't be better!\\"  He went on to explain how in the UK, when a talk show host asks you \\"how are you?\\" the guest will usually say \\"alright,\\" in a quiet, half defeated voice.<br /><br />The rules are just different.<br /><br />t
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|This is the KOL album that most likely will drive hard-core fans of their first three albums completely off the rails. And by hard-core fans I mean those who simply do not want the band to grow and change with time. \\"Mechanical Bull\\" has some of their most beautiful music to date, along with some rather funky grooves that show just how much the band is willing to take risks and create music that will satisfy themselves as a band along with fans who are willing to take a chance with them. \\"Beautiful War\\" and \\"Wait for Me\\" are haunting both lyrically and musically; while \\"Rock City\\" and \\"Don't Matter\\" fall into a more edgy rock sound that is a bit different yet similar to what they've done in the past. \\"Temple\\" is noteworthy because it's just gorgeous. \\"Supersoaker\\" gave me goosebumps the first time I heard it and really is a standout amongst all the songs. Personally, I find this album to be full of surprises--good surprises--and an absolute joy to listen to again and again.

B007ZI06FE|5.0|I was thrilled by how good this book turned out to be. Steampunk can spend a great deal of time on the punk and not the steam robbing the love story of its sparkle.<br /><br />In this book with fine world building, which blends the regency period, paranormal creatures, and the imagined steamed era perfectly.  You can easily imagine yourself as a character in this world.<br /><br />We have a vampire tale but the anthology of the vampire in unique and compelling. Our Crime Boss Alpha Hero is just ROAR! He is great.  Our down on our luck heroine is practical and one can easily see why he loves here.<br /><br />The plot is action packed with great secondary characters.<br /><br />What I adore about this book is that takes the best of Regency books in terms of details, manners, and constraints, and trope and shakes them up in an believable and absorbing paranormal steampunk world.<br /><br />Historical romance loves should feel just at home with live romance as paranormal loves.<br /><br />Well done!

B0053TMP24|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER! Besides for the rest of the series and all other Rick Riordan books. This would be confusing if you haven't read the lightning thief series.
B0089XH38M|3.0|While this is a good program to help keep your device safer, I've run into a problem with the updates.  Tells me there's an update,  I download it ok,  but it will not install.  It continues to keep bugging me that there 's an update but still won't install.  Very annoying.  Am tempted to remove it altogether.
B00821OX98|4.0|Have only seen the first half of the first season but so far a good show. Has really sucked me in.
B008XBCJ34|2.0|What happens when you take Disney's Pocahontas, change the skin color of the people to blue and throw in the word \\"unobtainium\\" and the name \\"Pandora\\"? You get Avatar. I'm not kidding, Google it.<br /><br />In our days of flashy CG effects and Michael Bay-esque explosions, we tend to forget that story matters and stories should be unique and interesting not just flashy. Take Star Wars for instance, the cheap effects and obvious puppets of the original trilogy are vastly better than the weak stories and terrible acting in the new trilogy. So when I have asked my friends why they like Avatar so much, the spew out the \\"Look how cool it is!\\" line. This is nothing short of the same as a bird attracted to a shiny piece of metal.<br /><br />In short, the story is a direct rip-off. The acting is ok, some of the performances are good and others are downright awful. But the movie itself is not for me. If you are a fan of the film, I'm sure a 3D Blu-ray is just what you are looking for, I simply disagree.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love when pieces of art move me. This one moved me. It will stay with me forever. I recommend this book. Highly recommend it.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|A good finish to a slow starte. Is it worth a look at history, yes so buy it and and submit a review.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thought it was very interesting the way the author added what would have been had 1 event never happened. How an event in a total strangers life can actually have a tremendous effect on someone else's future!!!

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I think Google puts out a great product, but at times can be a little elusive in its descriptions.  I bought this to stream sports from the internet to my TV, which it did just fine through the Chrome browser.  Whe I went to the show full screen mode to stream a movie I was watching on my laptop to the TV, only video came through.  I researched this and that's all you get.  No audio, meant return of product.

B00B22ASUM|5.0|The book has great heart-warming stories and anecdotes. I purchased another copy to send to a friend, and she also loved it. We have both purchased the next book about Bob the Cat.

B00008L3U1|5.0|I absolutely love Robin Williams. I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and was eccstatic to find it on DVD. If you've never seen it, get it, if you love Robin Williams you will def. love this movie. Bill Cosby and Jennifer Lopez are in it as well.

B003CH9PTU|5.0|After all the buzz about this series, I felt the need to check it out. I'm certainly conflicted about the premise of the show, rooting for a meth cooker and dealer- really?? Yet, I'm compelled to do just that.... The Walter Mitty characteristics of Walter sucked me right in. This is a well written and acted series.... Moving on to Season 2
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|my grandkids who are very tech savy love it. they figured it out quickly and played for hours; even the 3 yr olds

B003YL4LYI|5.0|As usual Mr. Martin provides us with so much intrigue, mystery, twists and action one can hardly put it down. I'm so entrenched, it saddens me to come to the end of the completed series; I can only hope the next book will not be too long in coming.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Very good app!!!But there are some things I don't really like(no enderman!!!!!)And they just need more tools and items like Xbox or PE.Overall,very good app!thanks Mojang;)
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Very detailed and very nail biting. The kind of book you never want to put down until you've finished it!
B00BWWS81S|5.0|Amazing.  I had almost given up hope that KT would hit another homerun out of the park on a parallel with Acoustic Extravaganza.  This one exceeds her former level(s) of creativity and I would most happily once again make the trip from the midwest to New York to watch her live performance as I did a few years ago.  Love ya KT!
B00ETPLQC8|5.0|I heard these four tracks online when they were originally released as a digital EP, and now it's nice to have them on CD since they're good songs, and since I'm not into iPods. Some of them, especially my favorite, \\"Just a Bullet Away\\", probably could've replaced tracks that made it onto Death Magnetic. Metallica might be aging, but they still have some fire left, as they showed when they played these songs live during their 30th Anniversary gigs in San Francisco. Similar to the other songs from the Death Magnetic sessions, the four tracks here show off plenty of metal riffs and solos, with equal portions of Black Album-style heavy rock. Here's a more detailed account of each track for anyone interested.<br /><br />\\"Hate Train\\"--The first half of this song features riffs very similar to \\"Fuel\\" and Black Album-era verses, with the second half sounding more like their thrash era. It has some slow parts with decent singing by James, but some of the first half might have sounded too close to \\"Fuel\\" to make Death Magnetic. The solos could be longer, but this song is definitely heavy on riffs and has a lot of different sections. Despite the \\"Fuel\\" riffs, I think it sounds less like the Re-Load era than several songs from DM.<br /><br />\\"Just a Bullet Away\\"--Awesome metal song, with great riffs, lyrics, and vocals...this one definitely should've been on Death Magnetic. It seems to be most people's favorite of the four, although \\"Rebel of Babylon\\" gets a lot of votes, too. I think it would fit nicely on the Black Album, as it's sort of an almost-thrash song that would sound at home with the heaviest few tracks from that release.<br /><br />\\"Hell and Back\\"--The strange song out of the four. It reminds me of \\"Broken, Beat, & Scarred\\" in some parts, and \\"Cyanide\\" in others. The weird verses in the first half don't remind me of anything from Metallica. They're almost alternative, I guess; not bad, really, just different. It gets fairly heavy in the middle, then continues with some nice riffs until the end. Even though it might be the weakest of the four tracks, it's still good enough for a solid 4 out of 5.<br /><br />\\"Rebel of Babylon\\"--This is another clearly heavy song like \\"Just a Bullet Away\\", with some fast riffing in the verses. James offers a few vocal lines that get about as old-school as he can manage these days. There's still a lot more singing than in the old days, but you hear traces of that gruff, harsh James of the past. It leaves a nice taste finishing things off heavy.<br /><br />Listening to the songs on this EP, I could make the case that some are about equal to tracks on Death Magnetic, so I can see where Metallica might have had a tough time deciding which ones to leave off that album. \\"Just a Bullet Away\\" is the only one that I'd gladly sacrifice a song for (maybe \\"Cyanide\\"), but just adding them to Death Magnetic would've made it too long in my opinion. Which makes it cool that they put them together for an EP to hold us off until a new album comes together. Clocking in at about a half hour with four 7-8 minute songs, Beyond Magnetic is a fine EP to add to Metallica's discography. Easily worth the $6 price tag.some nice riffs until the end.

B00F91H666|4.0|Good up until the ending then I wasn't so sure if I liked it very non exciting ending like the rest of the movie.
B005K0S2SW|4.0|I love this. There are a couple of weak tracks and none that are just &#34;huge,&#34; or I'd give it five stars. However, the musicianship throughout is excellent and there's a lot of creativity there. I especially like the first track, &#34;Buckjump,&#34; and &#34;Do to Me,&#34; with amazing guitar by Jeff Beck. Overall, though, the instrumentals stand up better than the more vocal-oriented tracks.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I was very disappointed with this book.  I found it to be somewhat interesting in the beginning and it turned out to be boring and the ending was strange.  I love legal type novels but this one just just flat lined!

B0055PGUYU|4.0|I could always feel it within me and more so when I have done vipassna. Which talks about something similar. Gautam Buddha had found this thousands of years back.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Yes, this book is strange. But it is also wonderful, magical, touching and beautiful. Even though I read it I could not do an adequate job &#34;categorizing&#34; it. Fantasy, allegory, magic, paranormal, new age? It's all of those things but...more. I cannot explain it adequately. I just know that I loved it. I loved the characters, I loved the writing, I loved the story. Truly beautiful and lyrical. I want to read more by this author.
B00CQRN3QI|4.0|Watched this with the kids. Totally forgot about the Indians. Had to have a fun conversation with my 3 and 4 year olds about how things change and what is there isn't acceptable, but that's the way things were. Seriously, they went bananas making this as over-the-top racist as they possibly could.<br /><br />Story is pretty good in general. Peter pan definitely needs to get some sense knocked into him, he can be quite a jerk. My daughter loves Tinkerbell (from the Disney Fairies movies) and my son enjoyed seeing Captain Hook and Mr. Smee in a different setting (he watches Jake & the Neverland Pirates).<br /><br />Back to the racism, though. If you aren't up for talking to your kids about racism, steer clear. It is a conversation that will need to be had if you let them watch.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Really enjoy.  The one irritating thing is that it has been asking me every day to do this darn review.  It just won't stop so I finally broke down and did it.  So there!!
0394800192|4.0|I remember this book from when I was a chlid and I thought my kids would enjoy it. It scores high for the nostalgia factor, but it is a \\"Theo Lesieg\\" book, which I find aren't nearly as good as the real deal Dr. Suess books. There is a reason he let someone else illustrate this one...<br /><br />It all starts out pretty straightforward. Stacking apples on heads, I mean, who hasn't had an apple stacking competition, right? I know that I personally can stack no less than twenty apples up on top. Nothing goes with a little apple stacking like breaking and entering. And we all know that the reaction any sane creature would have to a pack of wild animals in their kitchen attempting to stack (stolen) apples on their heads would be to grab the nearest mop and slap the apples off. In fact, the whole town knows this, which is why the crew gets chased out of town. No need to call the police or press charges though, we just crashed into an apple cart which in the illustration shows a number of smashed apples, but the aftermath is somehow just everyone with apples balancing on top of our heads. The truth is much more gruesome - several died that day in that terrible apple cart accident, and they should not be forgotten.<br /><br />Seriously, though, the writing isn't that great. It is trying too hard to not be nonsense and it just makes it stupid. Some of the rhyming seems like the good doctor was just feeling a bit lazy when he wrote it.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|I can't even get started.  I have uploaded this twice, and cannot click on anything.  Should have paid attention to the other reviews, are they ever going to fix this?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book a second time, I never read a book more than once. It still gets to me like the first time. I cry and I laugh through this book. Totally enjoyed it again.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|You will love this book! She is a riot! Very hard to put down when you are reading it and sad when you have finished reading it, because its over now and you so enjoyed looking forward to the next chapter!
B004SDEP38|1.0|I downloaded this free app to read PDF files only to find out that you can't even read them with the free app. Why would you call an app Documents to Go when you can't even read documents with it. Would definitely recommend using another app and not wasting your time with this one.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The author has a gift of getting he  characters well planted in hour mind, so much so that you want to know  what's next.  Very enjoyable an  easy read. Highly recommend.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was an awesome spin off of the Percy Jackson  Books with a lot of action and references to the Percy Jackson books

B00F52YOPA|5.0|Big file to download, but it's worth the wait. This is a really interesting story game with so many different hidden object levels.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|It is a mix between Potter and Twilight.  It has the magic and reaches into the mystical world of witches/daemons/vampires.  It has parts of over the top ridiculousness that make you think &#34;really?!?!&#34; and keeps it from reaching a five star level.  And lastly it is a law breaking, love story that breaks all rules by allowing two creatures (witch and vampire) to fall hopelessly in love...
B005LAIIJY|1.0|Typical Tarantino schtick married with virulently racist, anti-white sentiment.  If you like Tarantino and you hate white people -- probably because you're not that bright and you think what you see on liberal TV is real -- you'll like it.  The acting is decent and on par with the rest of his movies.  However, if the races were reversed, it would be banned as a hate film.  Just awful.  In a country where whites are constantly victimized by violent interracial crime, it's perversely irresponsible to make a movie promoting violence against whites and pathetic that Amazon sells this hateful trash.  Jamie Foxx is also a bigot who joked about how great it was to kill whites in a movie.  Just a shame.<br /><br />Two thumbs down.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I am going to use a basic scale here from 1 to 5 stars.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY: 5 Stars<br />MUSICIANSHIP: 5 Stars<br />SONGWRITING: 4.1 Stars<br />ORIGINALITY: 4.8 Stars<br /><br />You can tell from 'A Dramatic Turn Of Events' that the album was very mechanical and lacked focused inspiration from everyone in the band. With Portnoy leaving and Mangini coming in, that is understandable. This album is more put together with each member shining more effectively. Mangini's drumming is really letting loose, Myung's bass is more up front and crunichier than ever before (FINALLY!), and Petrucci and Rudess spare no moment to shine like musical gods as usual. A lot of inventive and complex solos in this record. Labrie's vocals are completely smooth and as operatic and flawless as many would expect from him, but nothing too dangerous or groundbreaking. The instrumentals on this album are just insane and alone are worth buying this album. And the mix I must say is just downright superb. Very clear and crisp mastering job. There are some little Rush and ELP moments which I am pretty happy about. I think a lot of the rhythms and nuances are very Fates Warning-ish with some Satriani-like riffs and solos. But there is a distinct Dream Theater feel to this record.<br /><br />Not the most catchy record, but the musicianship and sound quality are simply phenomenal. If you like prog metal or rock, you'd be ripping yourself off by not getting this album. It is seriously a masterpiece.<br /><br />Note: As with most DT material, multiple listens are required to let the music settle in enough to 'grasp' it effectively.
B00DXP7L88|2.0|I haven't seen the not-yet-released DVD of course, but just had to warn people away from watching this season. The series had gone downhill from its peak first few seasons (interesting main character and main story lines, with lame side characters and side stories) to being no longer engaging, and it really hit bottom this season. I saw a cheap-o book recently that listed the worst TV shows ever made, and I thought it was hilarious that the guy included Gilligan's Island which he slammed for plot inconsistencies. I've heard people complain about plot holes in this season of Dexter, but that's about as meaningful as wondering where Ginger got all those dresses. The whole final season was ridiculous and bad (unlike GI, which was ridiculous and fun). My wife refused to waste further time and quite half-way through the season; I kept watching because I like to watch train wrecks and so I watched this one to the end. It was a bad, bad end indeed. Trying to watch this while also watching the brilliant last season of Breaking Bad was truly painful.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Way to add flavor to the best angry birds made. I love the new birds, they follow the theme wonderfully.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Bought 2 more for gifts! A great behind the scenes look at one of the less seen Beatles; In addition it's a great inspirational story.
0061122416|5.0|Reading this book changed my life completely. It helped me to understand why certain things must happen in our lives in certain ways. This book inspired me to live my life knowing that God always takes care of his children regardless of difficult times. I helped me to understand why it's important to follow my dreams. I highly recommend this book. I have purchased more than 10 Alchemist books and gave them as gifts. It will always be My favorite book. Thanks Paulo for writing the greatest book I have ever read.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|This is not just another zombie apocalypse movie. This one actually has a story with characters that you will care about and feel for, as Brad tries to protect his family and others from the hordes of zombies that are springing up everywhere.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is so awesome!!! I just got it and I'm already addicted!!!! It's really easy too!! I've been playing for like 30 minutes already!! #loveit
B003U4UPHG|5.0|I just love this series.  Kinda sci fi-ish and kinda Peyton Place-ish - a wonderful blend.  If you saw the first season you cannot miss season 2!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Interesting and fascinating. Very hard to put down!! Can't wait to get started on book 2. Hopefully there will be some happiness at the end.
B00E6F155E|5.0|I saw this (POV/Live in Athens) concert tour in Dallas, Texas. It was my first Peter Gabriel (PG) concert, and to this day, my favorite concert EVER!!<br /><br />Peter &#34;connects&#34; with his audience in a way few performers can. He feeds off the crowd energy, and is the one artist who consistently outperforms his studio tracks with his live renditions.<br /><br />Those who were fortunate enough to see PG (& his amazing team) perform during this tour ought to feel extremely blessed & privileged. There are some magical moments in his Secret World & Growing Up tour performances, but the entire POV/Live in Athens tour was TRULY MAGICAL!!<br /><br />This concerts versions of San Jacinto, Shock the Monkey, No Self Control, Mercy Street, Lay Your Hands On Me & In Your Eyes are the best of all the live performances I've witnessed. Biko is a close second to PG's Secret World tour.<br /><br />If you are a long-time PG fan, I know you've likely been awaiting the release of this Bluray disc, which also LOOKS & SOUNDS AMAZING. I can [finally] put my Laserdisc version to bed. I had purchased 2 copies on Laserdisc, just in case one ever got damaged. That is how much I LOVED (was moved by) this concert performance, and this Bluray version is even better, as well as more complete.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I borrowed this movie from the library in return for an honest review. I have to start off by admitting that I didn't really care very much about the book, because I felt it was very hard to follow. The movie is just as peculiar and strange as the book but it's a lot easier to follow. I loved the plot and the characters in the movie and I would recommend this to any Sci-Fi lovers who have a passion for romance and happy endings.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|Give it a try. FUN game when your board, something to try 8 ball pool. Get YOU a cue and have fun.
B001EN71CW|5.0|It's Firefly. One of the most underrated SciFi series ever made. It's cancellation was the biggest mistake Fox ever made, 10 years later it has a following nearing Trekie status
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Rio is one the cutest movies for kids.  My son loves the dancing and music. I recommend this movie to everyone.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Come on! it's Serenity! Great movie! Cult classic. Quality of picture is fantastic. Would recommend this for any fan with a BR player.
074356619X|5.0|I love this CD.  I listen to it often during my commute.  I purchased a copy years ago but someone borrowed it and therefore, I had to have my own copy and ordered it again.
B00DB624GS|5.0|Love this album very much, however I am hard pressed to label it a rock album, or a rock and roll album. A lot of the pieces on this work are very sensitive, and penetrate deeper than a rock song does. Outside of \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\", and the two magnificent \\"Madge\\" jam numbers, most of the rest are very contemplative numbers, from a band in flux. Anyway, I would like to ask everybody, does anybody know just what that small snippit of classical music is that shows up near the end of \\"Searching For Madge\\" is, that Peter himself inserted, once he brought the master tapes home to work on them?  I would`nt mind having that in my collection as well.  My 5th. favorite album of all time, however it does`nt beat out, \\"Layla\\", \\"Zeps \\"4th\\", and Jimi`s first and third. Good company!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Another great Angry Birds game. Join the Pork side. Unfortunately I play way to often and have to plug my phone back in.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|The way everyone was talking I was expecting a horrible shambles of a movie. That was not the case. I have always been a Will Smith fan. Yes this was different. Was some of the story line not great? Yeah but it had a refreshingly different take on an old concept. I felt a good connection to the movie and stayed engaged the whole way through. That made up for any shortcomings the film may have had.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|Great light read. Short chapters and a fast read. This is eleven more words to finish my review of this book.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|The story is very attractive and it took several unsuspected twists, the characters are fairly develop. It's the best book by Dan Brown that i've read. I loved it!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|It reminds me of star wars podracer. I miss that game. This one is pretty sweet and the music is cool.
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|Excellent. Spell check almost did excrement. That woulda been great. LovE It!!!! Great sound with great depth. You have our gratitude. -Dr Klan & Ancestors
B00F35BV64|5.0|It was everything I expected in a Star Trek movie.  I loved it. A first rate movie with great actors.
B002OSXDAU|4.0|Do not pay attention to the wicked relationship of Dominic and Roark; instead take a look how masterfully Rand has used the word \\"erect\\" throughout the novel as the buildings specifically skyscrapers were built throughout the city.  In terms of the writing style, since this book was written earlier the Slavic sentence structure perturbing more so than in the later Atlas Shrugged.  Sections if not pages were translated from Russian to English especially looking at the choice of words that the author selected.  This is the book where her philosophy really takes shape, where you can see the white vs. black dogma without any grey in between.  It's not just prevalent in Rand because this is her philosophy; it is also there because of her own experiences.  The question comes did her experience shaped her philosophy or was her philosophy supported by the experience that she so obviously despised?  Think about this, she is born in St. Petersburg Russia in 1905, she gets educated in Russia and in 1926 she moves to United States. What happens in Russia in 1926?  Well, people are starving and are living in the cellars full of stale water going hungry for days, many for weeks.  These are the years when the collectivism was at its high, when millions of city dwellers were brought to starvation.  Policy of military communism was that Bolsheviks would take from those who had to those who did not have.  Sound familiar?  Yes, the roots of Ayn Rand philosophy comes from what she saw and experienced herself growing up in a Military Communism in Russia in 1920s.

1743117094|5.0|Truly, if there is anyone out there who reads more than I do I would like to meet him/her.  Having said that, I can honestly say that this book had a very cool plot with a terrific twist that I did NOT see coming.  It was very well written and I found myself laughing out loud at the \\"Britishisms\\" that sometimes appeared.<br /><br />The structure of the story, with various elements being recounted in 1941, 1961 and 2011 did not complicated matters and, once you get to the end, you will want to go back and re-read certain parts to see how your perception of events changes now that you know the ending.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well written book and a great story.
B00DJ80VLS|2.0|Dream Theater has been one of my favorite bands for many years now.<br />IMO:<br />Scenes from a Memory is a 5 star concept album.<br />Images and Words (ESPECIALLY for the time period it was written in) is a 5 star album.<br />Train of Thought is a brutal 5 star metal album.<br />Arguably, ADToE is a 5 star album because each song stood out so well on its own.<br /><br />Each of these has many memorable songs, the performance of instruments are excellent, and the albums seem to take you on a musical journey as a whole.<br /><br />This self titled album does not! While the musicianship is excellent, (Petrucci really is in killzone mode!), the songs are weak! Typically when I listen to a DT album, there is at least one or two songs that I feel so compelled to learn (on guitar) because they sound interesting or fun...I did not find that with this album.<br />It's a mash-up of standard DT stylings. There is nothing in here that seems PROGRESSIVE.<br /><br />Where are the epic buildups? The extended ballad solos that give you goosebumps? The oddball bridge breakdowns? The sincerity of just a vocal track and piano/strings?<br /><br />They're NOT HERE!<br /><br />It's a very tight performance, but ultimately incohesive. LaBrie's vocals sound like they have a constant overdub echo, or autotune. The bass is isolated maybe twice, but otherwise it vanishes in the mix. The drums sound like a machine click track half the time. Even the 'Trooch' himself sounds very compressed...which is odd given his use of Mesa/Boogies. which are notably looser sounding.<br /><br />If I were to rank their lowest album, it would probably be Falling Into Infinity, at 3 stars. But even that album had 3 or 4 songs (Trial of Tears? Hell's Kitchen/Lines in the Sand?) that belong in the amazing and recognizable repertoire of a band such as this.<br />This album has 0! Thus, it must be ranked lower, 2 stars. (Sheer performance merit keeps it above 1.)<br /><br />It pains me to say it, but the mighty have fallen on this one.<br /><br />On the plus side, through Amazon reviews and linked items, I've also just discovered Haken, Tesseract, Karnivool, and Riverside...and their albums sound really strong! Prog lives! :)
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I like the game just cant get on fb. this is my first time playing..so far really fun..<br />just need friends lol.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Its very fun-but if you play it for a long time and just cant beat a level it gets a bit boring
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great story! Couldn't put it down! Love books that aren't predictable. First time reading one of Liane Moriarty's books and can't wait to read the next one!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Easy to use and looks good.  Great options for the alarms and fades in smoothly to make waking up more peaceful without waking up the whole house.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|This book started very slow, the first 25 to 40 pages were difficult to work through. Persevere though and you will not be disappointed. The sharp, fast action kept my eyes and mind busy. What is somewhat frightening about this novel is that I could actually perceive a scenario such as the one depicted in Kill Decision occurring. I would definitely advise anyone who enjoys suspense,drama and intense action to read this book.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is a really neat app that can be  used at periodic intervals....the picture and word association is really a great way to remember the alternative language.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A lovely and beautifully descriptive story at times, dark and heartbreaking at others.  It made me laugh out loud and it made me cry.
B00B49GSOS|5.0|I love this movie.  Love the music throughout this movie and I love all<br />the characters and how they work together.  There is also some laughable<br />parts in the movie too.  Can't wait for the second part to be released.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have read all of the Sookie Stackhouse books and ignored the other bad reviews on this book. I figured they were haters and general negative reviewers. I was wrong and I wish I could get my money back for this dreadful book. The plot was thin and boring with very little surprises and even less suspense. You can guess the outcome in the first 2 chapters, and you aren't wrong. It felt cheesy and phoned in. The characters didn't seem to stay true to form. It was like the author used fan fiction to write it because she was out of ideas. I suggest skipping this book and fantasizing your own, and probably better, ending to this series. I am so disappointed with this book that I felt I should warn others about it.
1843794411|5.0|is absolutely wonderful!  The story, of course, is very &#34;romantic novel,&#34; which I don't usually read. However, I was looking for something--anything--read by Mr. Armitage.  I have seen him in many movies and television shows, and find him to be a really clever actor, able to play so very many different parts. To hear him read a book in his wonderful deep voice is perfect.  Even with his deep accents he manages to bring all of the characters in the book to life--the females as well as the males.  Each has his or her own voice, and I find it incredible that he can manage this.  I now own all three Georgette Heyer audio books read by him, and am planning on getting any others I can find.  I can only hope that even with his very great success as Thorin in The Hobbitt, that he will continue with the audio books. He is great company on a car trip!
B008X9Z37A|4.0|At first I thought it felt kind of cheap but it is adequate. Not the best but it does the job.
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|It was pretty good for a first episode, and generally first episodes leave a lot to be desired.  I enjoyed the &#34;He must never know&#34; about Agent Coleson, probably means he is a copy/robot.  JW does it again, let us all hope that it lasts.
B0016YBFZ8|4.0|An interesting character study, but not for the squeamish.  Violent, certainly, but not gratuitously so; at least not in my opinion.  The fascinating aspect of this film is that the three characters, the three so-called \\"Goodfellas\\", were completely, utterly lacking in any morally redeemable qualities.  They were truly evil personified; far beyond any supernatural \\"Satan\\" or \\"devil\\" film - something to keen in mind, if you choose to watch this film.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved how it was broken up into separate short stories about the war. Made for an enjoyable reading experience.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|An interesting look into human instincts and the judgements we make in the first seconds of an encounter.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|Laura Mvula's singing style has been repeatedly compared to the legendary Nina Simone, yet Ms. Mvula succeeds in creating her own beautiful and unique...I'll even add \\"haunting\\"...sound that is all her own. She is a highly trained composer and community choir director who has been heavily influenced, by her own admission, by Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, and Lauryn Hill; yet Ms. Mvula has found her own voice and relishes in her own pure and rather simplistic blend of vocals and orchestration. It seems, sadly, that every time someone new comes out, there's automatically a comparison to a former or existing artist. In this case, who does Laura Mvula sound like? Answer: Laura Mvula!! If this is only the first CD, I look to her future works as she grows in her art! Congratulations to her, and may she be blessed with a very long and positive journey!!
6305428050|5.0|I got this movie to show it to my kids, and aside from a little language I'd forgotten about (woops!), it's still as funny as I remember.  They liked it, ages 6, 8, and 10.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Hard to believe a book about running could be one of those &#34;I couldn't put it down&#34; books. McDougall is a master at weaving a compelling story. As a beginner runner, I was enchanted by this story of the ancient Mexican Tarahumara who run like the rest of us breath. This booked is filled with action, drama, science, and humor. You will love it even if you are a non-runner.<br /><br />I am a beginner runner and now when I feel like I might be getting tired (or &#34;bonking&#34;) I think of the Tarahumara who routinely run 50 miles+ up and down Grand Canyon-like terrain and doing so without fancy running shoes. Keeps me grounded and I always seem to get a second wind when I think about the stories in this book.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|This is a great, cult classic movie.  It's dark but still maintains humor through out.  It's definitely a must see!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Who could not be impressed by Scott Jurek's amazing feats of distance running? If you are a runner you MUST read this book. Once you do, it will humble you but also motivate you to keep pushing yourself. Getting tired on the long run? Think you are about to bonk on mile 20 of that marathon you have been training for for months? Remind yourself about what you read in this book and you will be able to self-motivate to continue. &#34;If these ultrarunners can go 100 miles +, then why would I quit/slow down now?&#34; Reading this book is like having Scott Jurek running next to you keeping you honest. :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy installation, great performance, superb image and sound: all for less than $10.00 after rebates and free Netflix 3-month subscription!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I just saw the movie &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; and was curious about the actual story.  So I downloaded this book and started reading it.  It's an easy read and I really like that &#34;Mark&#34; started with the beginning of his training up until the day of this mission.  There is a lot of detail in this book, but you don't have to be in the military to understand it.  I really enjoyed it and will read it again in the future.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|wanted my children to see the original version before jaden smith's version lit up the big screen  as a family we enjoyed movie and time spent together.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|An interesting take on the zombie apocalypse.  Told from the point of view of several interviewees.  Oddly enough, the scariest part of this book wasn't the actual zombie apocalypse, it was how society and various governments responded to it.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Great product. Just what I wanted. Very clear in talking with others back and forth. I would totally recommend this product...5 stars!!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I picked this up a few days ago as another FAOTD (thank you, again, Amazon!).  I've always wanted to learn to play Backgammon, and though this app isn't really designed to &#34;teach&#34; it, it makes it very easy to learn.  The graphics are good, and the game play is quick.  There are several options that can affect the duration of a &#34;match.&#34;  You can have a quick one-game match, or you can play to 15 points, requiring several &#34;games.&#34;  After playing this, I'm ready to buy my first real Backgammon set (from Amazon, of course!).
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love how this game has many different ways to find the hidden objects!  I gave only four stars because some of the objects are so small or blend in with the background that they are difficult to see/find.  A must download if you love hidden object games!
B00DB31Y3U|5.0|I purchased this game as the FAOD awhile back.  It is easy enough for my six-year old to play with and enjoy, but challenging enough for me to enjoy it too.  The controls may take just a little bit of practice, but we've both mastered them now, and I can move pretty quickly through the courses.  Definitely a great game!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This is my first time seeing Star Trek and seriously, I felt in love with story lines and visualization of this movie. It's just amazingly good movie
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I picked this up a few weeks ago as a FAOTD.  It has great graphics, easy controls, and is simply fun!

B00632HWOG|5.0|Looks great, functions well, and allows me access to all of my email folders.  I like how the message scrolls a little faster than my finger, so I don't have to constantly flick my finger to get all the way through an email.  Good job, Yahoo!
B0074VTHKM|3.0|I would not buy another Theo Boone series book. The story line is boring and the outcome very dependable. John Grisham did little to stay with his twists and turns plot writing. I am not excited about the series.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Great product.  I love being able to access all my stuff and share the things I want from my smartphone anywhere in the world.
B00EEL0LGY|4.0|My only problem with riptide is the fact that I cant play the game when my Internet is down . when you live in a country like mine service is limited.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This story catches you from the first page and then you can't stop. The love story is so sweet and deeply moving. It was the first book in a long time that kept me up until wee hours of th e morning. I will definitely ok barely not forget Will and Clark.

B00A285OOW|3.0|Margaret Beaufort is a tyrant, and everyone wants the throne.  Husband Henry is a total brute - obviously his son didn't fall far from the tree.  Weakest book in the series.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|While not typically my genre, I found Night Circus to be entertaining and hard to put down, possibly because of the references to &#34;shades of gray&#34;, but that's another story.  This fast moving plot seeks to reveal itself through the machinations of other world<br />Protagonists, manipulating and deceiving the more earthly characters.  As you might expect, love gets in the way.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Held me riveted through all episodes, and I highly recommend!  Olivia Colman and David Tennant alone are worth the watch, but the heartbreaking reveals by other characters make the storyline.

1250012570|5.0|Heartwarming. Raw. Loving. Funny. Tender. Brilliant.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park will sink through your skin, straight to your heart.<br /><br />This is the type of book where you start turning the pages more and more slowly as you get near the end because you can't bear to leave the story. Rainbow Rowell is a new hero of mine. She creates two characters - so vivid, so real, so deftly drawn - that it's hard for me to believe they don't truly exist on a bus somewhere, holding hands and sharing headphones.<br /><br />I'm keeping this review short and sweet with the promise that you will pick this book up and never want to put it down.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love the writers. I want to see more, it was that good!<br />I was very entertained.<br />Thank you Amazon.

B00DJ80VLS|2.0|As another reviewer stated, I won't bore you with my historical affection for this band and their entire catalog to this point. I think I can sum this up for Dream Theater fans. It is what I expected for the first album where Mike Mangini was involved in the writing. It is missing the organic imaginative qualities that Mike Portnoy brought to the band. Mike P. was an OCD control freak with a quirky personality. It might have been hard to work with him, but his magic imagination is missing. It's not that the songs are bad per-se, but they lack the edge and unpredictability that their songs often had in the past.<br /><br />Looking back to Mike P.'s last album with the band and comparing a song like Count of Tuscany or Nightmare to Remember to these is all it takes to hear the difference in attack and production-- the new songs are a bit lifeless. They don't really build or wander, they just go to places that the listener might expect. There is a lack of rawness and clarity that gets lost in  the over compression, especially of James' vocals. James' voice actually sounds good, but unfortunately, it sounds the same in each song with the same \\"lustre.\\"<br /><br />Last, the drumming that Mangini lays down isn't bad. He's hugely proficient, but his playing is not noteworthy. There is nothing he plays that will stick in your head for a long time as some of the old patterns like Metropolis or Under a Glass Moon (ADDED: 6:00, Fatal Tragedy, Great Debate, Test That Stumped Them All, Honor Thy Father, Panic Attack, Never Enough, In the Presence of Enemies, etc.) have. To be honest, I can see why Steve Vai moved on and has a kid like Jeremy Colston as opposed to Mangini. Undoubtedly, Mike M. can play anything, but he is not inventive at all. He sounds overly mechanical.<br /><br />So to sum it up, this album is best described as an example of work by a band who lost one of the critical components of the chemistry that created their signature sound.
B000S1M9LY|2.0|One continuous sentence of narcissistic claptrap.  I thought David Foster Wallace might be interesting after reading one of his essays.  I was wrong.  this book has 1000 pages.  I usually love long books.  Doggone it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A spin on other New Age books but has some practical exercises that are fun.  This is a great book for those that are new to the idea of creating reality and controlling outcomes and carries a positive message.  I would definitely recommend it.

B0064MPXFA|2.0|Maybe my expectations were too high from all the hype. This show is just another one about attorneys and court cases.  The writing and acting are also just mediocre.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My favorite game. I just wish I could have more time. I would play it all day!<br />I recommend this game
B008AIGWVA|1.0|Not a game, just testtube mixing.  After about five mixes, free ones were gone.  Broken hearted 4 year old!  No explanation given.

B000HT3PPG|5.0|I watch this movie every year and last Christmas I realized that I only had it on VHS and couldnt play it so I had to find it on regular tv to get my fix.  Well from now on I wont have that problem.  You just cant beat a classic.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|This doesn't even rate as trash. Purely awful - and not a redeeming feature in it - acting, set, directing, script (or original material for that matter) - absolutely nothing about this film is worth watching.
B00004TS0E|5.0|While this is the newest version of a classic I like it just as much.  I watch both versions every Christmas.
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|What a waste of time.  I was hoping it would be better than Captain Avenger, First Avenger.  I played solitaire on my iPad throughout the movie. Pointliess movie.

B00DYCFLRI|3.0|I listened to the entire album from beginning to end & it wasn't all that good. The only song that was worth listening to was \\"Lonely Girl\\". As far as the rest of songs I felt they could've done a better job. That's just my opinion, I know there's other people who will really enjoy this album but not for me.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Enjoyable and can be played (a little slowly) without buying any in app purchases. Definitely worth trying out, and its free.

B00BATKPBE|5.0|aAfW is a really interesting book. It does a great job planting professor Dawkins in a historical context and explaining what inspired him to go into the sciences. My favorite part is the author's explanation of how he came to be born in Africa and his similarities with his parents and uncles. It really humanizes him. Like his other books, this is clearly written and an absolute page turner and I cannot recommend it enough.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|August Pullman is a shoo-in for my list of Most Memorable Characters of All Time. He is honest and straightforward; he doesn't hide his pride or his pain. And he makes me want to give him a hug (which he would hate, because ten-year-old boys tend to protest mightily against physical displays of affection unless they involve throwing a ball at someone's head or something.)<br /><br />Let me tell you a little bit about Auggie: He was born with a severe facial deformity. Due to years of surgeries and hospitalizations to get his face to function at its best (which is still pretty bad), he's been homeschooled for his entire life. Now he's about to go into fifth grade, and his parents want him to give school a shot. Auggie refuses at first, but finally agrees to try.<br /><br />Wonder follows Auggie through his first year at Beecher Prep. He learns a lot about kids, cruelty, and ultimately, acceptance. But the acceptance takes a lot of time, and I can guarantee you that your heart will break for Auggie over and over again as he struggles through the year. Kids can be horrible to each other, and even though the things that happen in this book are really no surprise, they're still disappointing. The human race is both inspiring and prone to demolition, and this book provides a healthy serving of each.<br /><br />The book isn't told entirely by Auggie, though: there are sections written by Auggie's friends from school as well as his older sister Via, her friend Miranda, and her boyfriend Justin. The characters are honest in their reactions to Auggie's face as well as his personality, and overall, it's a truthful, touching examination of what it means to be -- and to be affected by -- August Pullman.<br /><br />All in all: Everyone should read this book: kids, to understand how bullying affects people; parents, to remember to raise kind children; and the rest of you, to remember just how fortunate you are and how much of a difference a little kindness can make.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I'm not much good on the computer, I don't understand if things go into different formats, and so on. So I am thrilled that this package goes straight to my Word docs, easy to transfer both ways, easy to find, simple messages, no jargon! I am a writer, and I wanted something just like this - a dedicated word processor. I love it. But it also has Excel and PDF, so makes the complete mobile office too!<br /><br />Great. Thanks. Am answer to a prayer!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is fine but it always crashes and I have to delete it and then get it again. Its really annoying. The new update was better though and I was finally able to get Rarety.One thing I don't like is you have to wait a long time for stuff.Other than that it is an awesome game.;D
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|this game is addictive but I love it<br />. I hate having to wait for more entertain so I can continue playing
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Would love to see this turned into a graphic novel. This story has a great comic book feel to it.
B003U9TDII|5.0|I enjoy listening to this while studying, working, or programming.  Since the music has no lyrics, it works well for that and keeps me motivated by the beat.
0812550706|4.0|Well, this certainly isn't a literary masterpiece. It's fun reading though. Being written in the 80s, it's full of conventional 80s sci-fi themes. Nerdy boy gets picked on, grows into a leader, becomes a hero by saving the world against aliens.  You know, the sort of wet dreams teenage boys re-enact in video games over and over. It's predictable and we know the good guys (us humans) always win.
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and like to listen to the music while I work and study to keep me moving as I work.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|Terrible writing style.........a waste of my money and time.  My book club did not care for the book, but we had some laughs in voicing our dislike.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|Had to install it twice on my Kindle Fire HD just to get it to open. When I navigate to my documents to open one for editing (all doc or docx) the file names are all gobbldy gook!

A Laugh-A-Minute Ring-A-Ding Rollercoaster!<br /><br />Imagine a cyclone, a Tex Avery cartoon come to life as a zoot-suited fashionista and the wiggy energy of a vat full of jumping beans and that still doesn't capture Jim Carey's comic genius as Stanley Ipkiis, a repressed bank clerk who goes from zero to hero when he dons The Mask. The mysterious mask Stanley Ipkiis finds allows him to do what he normally can't, like woo Tina [Cameron Diaz] and beat the baddies. Beneath all that loopy fun is the film's heart: Does Stanley really needs the mask to be the person he longs to be? Flat-out smoking'!<br /><br />FILM FACT: Awards and Nominations: 67th Academy Awards®: Nominated: Best Visual Effects.

First, it was based on an offbeat cult comic book, which was created by John Arcudi and Doug Mahnke, and published by Mike Richardson's Dark Horse Comics, and a practice which seems to be the norm. Second, with its then-cutting-edge use of computer graphics augmentation, it gave a sense of cartoon-y whimsy to what would have been an otherwise straightforward action picture, taken to the ninth degree; we're now given something like 'Speed Racer.' And finally, it saw the potential in a little-known comic named Jim Carrey, who would go on to become a box office juggernaut.<br /><br />The storyline of ‘THE MASK’ concerns one Stanley Ipkiss [Jim Carrey], a loveable loser who works at a bank and lets everyone walk all over him. One night he stumbles upon a mystical, vaguely defined mask that turns him into the titular antihero. Forgoing the comic book's hyper-violence, the film instead turns Stanley Ipkiss into an even goofier Nutty Professor, an over-caffeinated raconteur able to stretch, squash, and manipulate himself and others in the tradition of famous animator Tex Avery.<br /><br />From there, things get more complicated, as his outlandish tomfoolery soon attracts the attention of a group of villainous gangsters led by Dorian Tyrell [Peter Greene] and the police Lt. Mitch Kellaway [Peter Riegert]. The film climaxes with a siege on a charity ball in keeping with the cartoon feeling, the money for the charity is held in a giant pink piggy, with Peter Greene wearing the mask, amplifying his evil. This is when the film shifts into all out lunacy, with multiple human and non-human, wearers of the mask, gun fights, explosives, the whole bit, and it all ends up being a little... blah!<br /><br />To some ‘THE MASK’ isn't an exceptional film, but to me it is totally hilarious and I love it from when I saw it at the cinema and have loved it ever since. Besides the truly rubbery performance by Jim Carrey and to me, this is his ONLY best film ever, and some of the visual effects are totally brilliant, especially the Tex Avery type cartoons and acts like a B-movie with gangsters and garish visuals thrown in for good measure and I feel that director Chuck Russell does a brilliant job overall. Jim Carrey, of course introduced us to Cameron Diaz in her first big screen role and shines like a beacon throughout the film and of course it helped catapult Cameron Diaz career big time.<br /><br />A word of warning, do not under no circumstances purchase the follow up film entitled ‘Son of The Mask,' because I would advise to steer well clear of this atrocious re-make. What we basically have here is a license for the filmmakers to do whatever they want to do with the special effects, while the plot, like Wile E. Coyote, keeps running into the wall. Talk about dumb and dumber.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – Honestly, I was shocked by this single-layer 1080p encoded image and the 1.85:1 aspect ratio transfer. This must  be the best this film has ever looked. The film has been plagued from its original home video inception with muddy visuals; the garish lights of Edge City bleeding into the picture and giving everything an orange-y tint. Sometimes it still goes over the top, with some digital noise, but it wasn't enough to quell my enthusiasm for the transfer and there's no noticeable grain or visual blips. Contrast has been upped to give the entire movie more depth and clarity, really bringing the fictional Las Vegas-meets-Detroit vibe of Edge City to life. And the effects really pop in this transfer, for better or worse, since with their added sheen, they seem a bit more disconnected from the actual film. While certainly not a reference-quality presentation, you could still show ‘THE MASK’ Blu-ray to anyone who saw it in the cinema and say &#34;Now, look at THIS&#34; on your Home Cinema set-up and they would be very, very impressed.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – The 5.1 Dolby TrueHD Master Audio track is really, really great. The cartoony nature of the films means you get really outlandish scenes that are really served well with the impressive sound mix, especially when Jim Carrey is ping-pongs down the apartment corridor, for instance, all channels are worked vigorously. The dialogue-heavy scenes, are supported by a great front-speaker mix, really shine, with very little in the way of ambience or in-between sound. It's either boom, kapow, klang, or its two people talking in the front speakers. There's very little in the way of middle ground, audio-wise. Still, I would say this is a solid mix - loud and aggressive when it needs to be, sporting great front-speaker mix. Honestly, the film has probably never sounded this good, either. The audio package is augmented by a perfectly listenable standard 5.1 Dolby Digital sound mix in both English and German.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Chuck Russell, New Line Cinema Co-Chairman Bob Shaye, Writer Mike Werb, Executive Producer Mike Richardson, Producer Bob Engelman, Visual Effects Supervisor Scott Squires, Animation Supervisor Tom Bertino and Cinematographer John Leonetti: If you are going to listen to one of the two commentary tracks provided here, this is the one to go for. Everyone provides super-useful information from their point of view, and with so many participants, you might think things would go a little off the rails, but whoever edited it does so superbly. A little vocal placeholder will pop in, letting you know it's &#34;writer Mike Werb&#34; or whoever, so in case you forgot what a person sounds like you will be covered. This track does seem cobbled together from different interviews, but whoever put it together does a good job to match the content of the commentary with what's happening on screen. For example, someone will be talking about the bank heist sequence while the bank heist sequence is on the screen, etc. You'll learn a lot of great titbits about the making of the film, like how visual effects house Industrial Light & Magic assigned its B-team to the movie, which ended up getting praised for its visual effects. Some of the commentary may seem redundant, with similar ground covered in the special features documentaries, but this lively track is still worth a listen.<br /><br />Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Chuck Russell: This is the other commentary track option, very dry and very dated, at one point Chuck Russell says, &#34;See if you can rewind this on your LaserDisc.&#34; Oops, they should have edited this part out, as it is very lazy and sloppy to keep this in or even better, not allowing it to be added into this particular supplement? As there will be youngsters today who will think he is talking Martian.<br /><br />Special Feature: Return to Edge City [27:16] A nice, fairly comprehensive making of documentary, which covers the whole history of the project and it was originally conceived as a successor to the `Nightmare on Elm Street' series, as a kind of horror-comedy, plus we have interviews from all the principle cast and crew.<br /><br />Special Feature: Introducing Cameron Diaz [13:17] Detailing the miraculous hiring of Cameron Diaz in painstaking detail. Really I get it. Cameron Diaz was hired on ‘THE MASK’ as a fortuitous fluke and now she's a big star. Let's move on, as it is now old hat news.<br /><br />Special Feature: Cartoon Logic [13:43] This was my favourite special feature by far, with an investigation into the animated origins of some of ‘THE MASK’ best gags. Animation historians are interviewed, and footage from old Tex Avery cartoons is juxtaposed with what occurred in the film. It's really greatly light, but heavy with information. So all in all it is just great and totally brilliant.<br /><br />Special Feature: What Makes Fido Run [10:51] While this is supposed to be about the dog in ‘THE MASK,’ and how it performed a lot of the astounding stunts in the film and there is a great section about how they taught him to &#34;put on the mask&#34; in one of the film's most beloved scenes, it soon opens up to be about animal actors in Hollywood and I kind of checked out. I'd say that the first five minutes, is great, and last only five minutes, which you can skip.<br /><br />Special Feature: Additional scenes with commentary with Chuck Russell [3:54] Just a couple of minor scenes, one is an alternate opening sequence, with Vikings traveling to America just to dispose of the haunted mask. This scene is cheap looking and unfinished, and would have added nothing to the film. The second scene is the death sequence for morally ambiguous reporter Peggy [Amy Yasbeck] and is pretty entertaining. I won't spoil this for you.<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer [1994] [1:00] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for ‘THE MASK.’<br /><br />Finally, I really liked this film, as I think it shows off splendidly the comedic talent of Jim Carrey at his best, but sadly his other film releases were as far as I am concerned dead ducks and Ido not know why people go mad over those very second rate bargain basement films. This film is the perfect production for him to unleash his unique brand of comedy whether it is over the top, or damped down for a specific scene. Graced with a nice set of extras, decent picture and sound quality, and the debut of Cameron Diaz, I highly recommend this film for fans, and non-fans alike of Jim Carrey. This film is a lot of fun, and director Chuck Russell does a real nice job of crafting a true to life Tex Avery cartoon that lovers of the older short cartoons will truly enjoy and ever since it was originally released in the cinema again I really loved this film and is a really true tour-de-force comedy classic and shows off the actors at their best and that is why I am so proud to own this Blu-ray disc and will give me endless hours of enjoyment.

B000W9399S|5.0|I bought this book on a whim after reading some quotes of the author. I was quite tired at that moment, having just woken up and didn't fully realize the purchase until much later. When I did realize what I had done, I had no idea what the book was. So, I decided to sit down and at least give the ill bought book a try. Now the ill bought book is my favorite book. It's time to make another rash purchase of the next disc world novel.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|Loved the movie and the book so I didn't hesitate to purchase the DVD.I didn't give 5 stars because I was hoping fore more on the dvd e.g. deleted scenes or a booklet with information.The case simply contained the disc and no &#34;extras&#34;
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie, saw it in the theaters.  But seeing it in 3D is so much better!  This version may have more copies than you need (a regular DVD is kind of pointless if you own Bluray, plus you get both the regular Bluray and the 3D Bluray) but the digital download is nice.  I can take the movie on the go, and watch it while I'm doing cardio at the gym!

B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I love this game, and the background music is amazingly catchy. The levels get harder and harder - I'm currently stuck on 37 - but they seem doable. I completed several of them without knowing how, which means I'll probably go back and start over when and if I get up to level 40.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is an inspiration to all working women to excel and not let themselves be left behind. Found lots of great career advice. Two thumbs up!!!
B00FF56IR4|5.0|With the departure of WAREHOUSE 13, we finally have something worth watching. It's been too long since we've seen the \\"Grr! Arrgh!\\" Yes, there are a lot of tv tropes at play, but Joss Whedon is adept at turning them on their ear. Loved not only the connections to AVENGERS and IRON MAN 3, and the appearance by Maria Hill, but also the mention of Project Pegasus (which in the comics is a center for aleternative energy sources slash prison for supervillains. Skye's mention of it seems to be to a past event, and let's hope it's not too much like Binghamton on ALPHAs. Another nice touch was the way Whedon never forgets actors whom he's used before: J August Richards and Ron Glass were welcome sights. Will definitely be purchasing each episode as soon as it appears on Amazon!

0374275637|4.0|Mr. Kahneman is a genious. This book is awesome and has many stories, cientific studies and information on decision making. But I have to confess that I could not finish the book. It is too big and in my opinion has so much repeated information. I did not find this book direct to the point. It flies around the main theme for pages and pages, repeating the same information over and over, until get to the point.<br />I would recommed the author to rewrite a resumed version of this book, being more directly. For business people.
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|Just not crazy about the game or the tiles and I think the rules are a bit confusing.  Much better games on the market.
0321811984|4.0|I liked this book. The author brought in this book very good tips about how to build an outstanding presentation. After you read this book you will be ashame of your former presentations. Believe me. After I read the book,  I redesigned a presentation I had and the improvement was astonishing.  However I felt the author could bring more practical examples.<br />One recommendation is: this book is not about public speaking, only about making presentation. Don't buy it if you expect to learn only about public speaking.<br />Another recommendation is: look for Mr. Reynolds videos on Youtube. He gives many tips he wrote in the book.
B008469DGY|3.0|This game is fun but is also a bit of a let down. It doesn't let you play out full holes. Everything is a single swing and scoring is based on proximity to the flag or a hole in one. There are no longer holes, no fairway play, etc... If this game had actual full hole play along with the courses, it would be the best golf game out there for the android period. The user interface for gameplay is awesome! You give it a flick to hit the ball and then you can influence it's travel by adding spin with strokes on the screen during flight... pretty cool!<br /><br />Hopefully, they will add full hole and full course play. If that is done, I will change my rating to five stars.
B000N2HCKQ|4.0|This is a very good book. Great insights. I bought the kindle edition and read the ebook in three days. It was trully worthy for me. I am sure that you can learn a lot and if you apply the knowledge of this book in your daily life, will improve your communication skills considerably.

B0091LRZZW|3.0|I am a huge Paul McCartney fan....but this video was just ok.  I enjoyed it ...but not as much as his other concerts out there.  I love his concerts!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Honestly, my interest wasn't kept much throughout this book. I'd stop frequently, not even thinking of it when I wasn't reading it. Good books, I consider the characters when I'm daydreaming but whereas this book is different folks being interviewed, you don't feel like you KNOW them.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I bought this Anker USB 3.0 4 port splitter on June 21st, 2013 through Amazon. The shape of the product I have looks a little different than what's pictured on this page now (mine is square-shaped), but my order history links back here so the seller must have changed the image and the design of the product. When I first got it, I was very pleased by the price, performance, size, and appearance of the splitter.<br /><br />It worked well with all my USB devices - wireless mouse, Plantronics audio headset, external hard drives and more. It also worked well on both Windows 8 & 7 devices. Then one fine day about three weeks ago (early September) it just suddenly stopped working. It hadn't been dropped, damaged, subjected to extreme temperature, abused or even improperly stored (I've stored it in the little anti-static plastic sleeve it ships in, and I pack it safely inside my laptop bag).<br /><br />I'm still trying to reach out to the manufacturer using the information provided by Amazon but I've had no luck. Since it's outside the 60 day return window, I cannot just return it and get my money back or a replacement. And this hasn't inspired confidence in me to buy the same product again despite the good reviews that others have posted. I'm rather disappointed that the device failed on me in such a short time. If it had died after a year or more, I wouldn't have bothered to even write this review.<br /><br />Sadly, there aren't many USB 3.0 splitters in this price range to begin with, let alone find ones that have positive reviews. AmazonBasics has a comparable offering but it is extremely backordered and not available until January or February of 2014. I have a Microsoft Surface Pro, which has only 1 USB port, and it's never fun (or practical) to have to choose between plugging an external mouse, a thumb drive, or a headset. For the interim, I had to settle for a USB 2.0 splitter from AmazonBasics, since I travel a lot and can't afford to be without one.<br /><br />If you're considering buying this, I would advise you to proceed with caution. The ride will be fun, but it may not last very long. Of course, as they say, YMMV (your mileage may vary).<br /><br />UPDATE (3/14/14): I've been meaning to update this review but kept forgetting to. Shortly after my review, the manufacturer reached out to me and sent me a replacement at no cost to me. The replacement unit looks different from the first one I received. It's a little thicker / heftier - actually looks like the product image they use now. I've had the replacement piece since October 2013, and it has been working perfectly. I appreciate the manufacturer's prompt response to my review, and their effort to remedy the situation. I've upgraded my rating of the item from 1 star to 5 stars.ou're considering buying this, I would advise you to proceed with caution. The ride will be fun, but it may not last very long.

B00005A1PR|5.0|I have become a fan of India's over this last year.....so glad I found her music and soul....she speaks to my soul and I thank her.
B00E6Z0THE|1.0|I usually really like games like this, but this one is awful.  It's colorful and eye-catching, but the grammar is worse than a fifth graders!  I may just be extra picky, but I can't get past it.  I won't even try to complete it.  It's too annoying.
B004FN1T3A|2.0|For moms who do not have the time or budget for a hypnobirthing class, this book was a disappointment. It was written as a complement to those expensive classes and DVDs. I would not recommend this to friends.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is very eye opening into some things that I want to improve on in my life. I found it to be a very quick read but I really wanted to take my time and absorb everything it was teaching me. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that may be looking for more answers. I am truly grateful that I found this book. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!
B00AECGQF2|3.0|We like this app, but it is limited to what it can do and how the hairstyles can be changed. Wish it had a more ways to do the hair.
B00B7NPRY8|4.0|Amazingly much actually! I had expectations about this book concidering haveing played all the games and seen the movies \ tv-series. I imagined the screenplays been boosted up to create more drama and action than the book could possibly say about a desert planet. I'm glad I read this book as it did hold me captivated. The book not only pictures the life on a desert planet, but also of human cultures from the rich to the more nomad tribes of the Fremen living in the deep desert. It tells of religion and tradition, and creates a vast and rich story on a planet filled to the brim with sand, even if it's inhabitants have a hope for a different future.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|My granddaughter gets a big kick out of using this app. It's fun and very entertaining to pass the time away.

B004DM1ZQY|4.0|This reminds me of when I was hanging out with my girlfriends as a teenager and having fun playing backgammon.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's okay it's enough to occupy your time when you have nothing to do. I wouldn't pay money for it but I love mystery games
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Go  got it downloaded and it's as awesome as I new it was going to be,having an really good time playing it with my family.
0060760710|5.0|I WOULD RECOMMEND TYHIS TYO EVERY PERSON WHO IS UNABLE TO READ OR TO ANYONE JUST WANTED TO RELAX AND LISTEN
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game just wish I could also access it through Facebook on my laptop. Need to work kinks.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|love it. it is my favorite game. glad to be able to play on my kindle! will try on nook next
B005HSG3VK|4.0|ive been looking at alot of csses and dont want to spend alot of money. marware seems like a good brand but i dont read anywhere if it swivels or not. does it?
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|I got this exactly when I needed it to give as a gift. Thanks so much. Will use you again!
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|I  have played this game since it was released and it is worth the 5 stars. I gave it one star because after every update, there is something that stop us from playing . Last update it was a ghost update....this update I can't log in..plse gameloft fix
B00E38KGF4|5.0|The others I tried did. I cannot evaluate the data base on the server, but so far so good. Nice simple, straight forward program. Auto scans new down loads and installations. Very pleased.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Have not found a Star Trek Movie or Series that I have not enjoyed watching and Into Darkness is among the best ones I have seen.  Was wondering if Khan would show up in this younger years and his appearance was just awesome.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|Best friend collects Hello Kitty and she loved it!  That was all that mattered to me.  As long as she was happy so was I.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is so handy and easy to use,<br /><br />I really don't feel the need yo ever resort back to setting my table top again..
B005HE5J7I|2.0|this is an example of that unfortunate state of affairs.  For me, the story just isn't there;  not the worst I have ever read, but not rewarding;  wish I had saved my money.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game. It is easy to play so all ages can do it. It is also lots of fun.
B00874T02K|4.0|I like the app.  Keeps me on schedule, and motivated to do more. Over all a great starting platform for fitness goals.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Now reading: Doctor Sleep by Stephen King, on Kindle rather than the real hardback. Because when I read The Shining when I was a teenager, I had to bury the silver foiled book in my sock drawer and could not even look at it if I meant to go to bed and actually sleep. P.S. Had to keep my bedroom light on all night (much to consternation of parents)until I loaned the book to a friend (sorry Mr. King - none of us had the money back then to do anything but share and I feel bad about that). Ironic that the sequel to The Shining is \\"Doctor Sleep.\\" Note to self: make sure all light bulbs in every light fixture in house are replaced immediately.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The book is well thought out and the best I have read so far at placing you in the time and place of the 1st century CE.  The work can become a little tedious, but on the whole it is very readable and I have recommended it to friends and colleagues freely.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun game. Addictive. Needs more chances to have shadow card where you win items to turn in for credits. Also would like to have more free credits each day than just getting ones from friends. Slots are also fun but you have to bet a lot of money to win big or earn collectibles. Definitely recommend.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Unique story, great characters and above all fantastic writing.  Stayed up too many nights unable to put it down.  Finally I get go sleep now.  Looking forward to the sequels.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|It kept me guessing up until the end. I never saw the characters line up this way. I'm looking for another one.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Not bad but  i can't seem to figure out how to add suits yet. It's awfully easy with just one suit.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|I had a hard time putting it down.  It's not only a gripping tale of U.S. nuclear weapons accidents, but it also serves to make the larger point that everything that can fail, will fail at some point. And even if something is incredibly important and we put our best and brightest on it, it will be possible for it to fail.
B0076R6MES|5.0|Rowan Atkinson never fail to entertain!  Though I loved the first Johnny English more, this one was funny and interesting too.  I think in this movie they tried to tone down the character too much to sort of make him normal.  The first Johnny English was more Mr Beanish, this one was less so.  Anyhow, it was interesting and I highly recommend it!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Pam has been there, done that with all the major self-help gurus, and manages not to come across as one of the drinkers of Kool-Aid. She has a fresh, smart, and insightful approach to a topic that too often feels trite and overexposed. She's funny, real, and has lived the lessons she is sharing in this book. I can't wait to start my local group!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|It is so much fun to see this cat talking and complaining when you touch it is great.  It gives the impression that is real.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|Kelly Clarkson has it all:<br /><br />The Voice, the looks and fantastic songs.<br /><br />This collection is perfect. The very best of Kelly's output.<br /><br />BUY IT! you will not be disappointed.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|When I need a giggle I play with Ben. Great free app. I will probably play with all of them.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|This is the best album of 2013.<br /><br />The album is varied and not such a departure from prior releases that you wouldn't know it was Drake.<br /><br />This is his finest album, thoughtful, superb lyrics and beautiful tunes.<br /><br />Listen to the excepts here on Amazon, get the flavour of the album and then Buy it.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed.
B004UIOUHC|4.0|So this was a decent option for me.  Works better than the default Android browser, that's for sure.<br />Would prefer Firefox though.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Makes great for a gift brand new play well, good disney movie and came with extras. love it so much
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have come to love this book more and more every time I read it. I'm a teenager and this is for sure my favorite book ever. Just a love story with a twist a wonderful twist that you learn to love and hate at the same time. Just when you think something good will happen something bad happens that's what I love though. It teaches you to not take anything for granted. It has such an inspiring message. I would encourage anyone to read this book. Not for the drama or the sadness, but simply for the pure love in a story that shows some people's reality.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Good plot....i just love his character ...though he was gonna get the girl. I have read every book now ..enjoy
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|LOVE this- they continue to do an amazing job taking GR MARTINS amazing work into a show. Well done! I dont have cable, so 2bucks for an episode is nothing!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Excellent book it's helped me already and I'm not even finished reading it yet I would highly recommend most people read it anyway
0783231202|5.0|What a eye opening story of the hardships of the African slaves.  I loved their courage and the diligent attorney.  The acting was top notch.  Great movie!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|First off, let me say, until this movie, I was a Star Trek lover, but for the Primetime series back in the 80's.  Yes, I was very young, but remember most of those shows.  Always loved the TV show vs. the movies, until NOW!  This is honestly better than their first movie.  It honestly seems as if they are getting BETTER with each movie!  How many franchises can say that?  Then again, that is just my opinion, take it or leave it. :)
B000OLRH10|5.0|The father in this movie was amazing.  He endured so much and what kept him going was the love of his family.  Makes you almost not want to ever buy a diamond product again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so intriguing I could not put it down. Best book I have read in a very long time!
B002GIBVV6|5.0|It is a sweet movie.  The young girl finds happiness when she has the chance to serve her cousin.  Her hard headiness gives him the courage to walk again.  Uplifting story.  We need more good movies like this one.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|I was not expecting a great zombie movie because I said to myself why the hell would Brad Pitt be in one but this is not a typical zombie movie this is part environment/governmental/human kind movie! Great CGI not noticeable but watched the outtakes and best quote was Mother Nature is the best serial killer of man..or something.
